Positive 889 pOur code is written in C 11 VS2012Win 764bit. The C library provides a codesleepforcode function that we use. We observed that the C codesleepforcode sometimes shows a large overshoot. In other words we request to sleep for say 15 ms but the sleep turns out to be e.g. 100 ms. We see this when the load on the system is high. p  pMy first reaction of course the sleeps take longer if there is a lot of load on the system and other threads are using the CPU. However the funny thing is that if we replace the codesleepforcode by a Windows API Sleep call then we do not see this behavior. I also saw that the codesleepforcode function under water makes a call to the Window API codeSleepcode method. p  pThe documentation for a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryhh920528.aspx relnofollowsleepfora statesp  blockquote   pThe function blocks the calling thread for strongat leaststrong the time thats specified by emReltimeem. This function does not throw any exceptions.p blockquote  pSo technically the function is working. However we did not expect to see a difference between C codesleepforcode and the regular codeSleepExcode function.p  pCan somebody explain this behaviorp

The other important benefit of ReplaceFile is continuity of file identity  creation date and other metadata.p  pFooEdit also keeps open a handle to the file with a sharing mode of just FILESHAREREAD, so that other processes can open the file but cant write to it while it while FooEdit has it open for writing.p  pObviously, this handle has to be closed briefly while the ReplaceFile operation takes place, and this allows a race in which another process can potentially open the file with write access before FooEdit reestablishes its FILESHAREREAD lock handle.p  pIf FooEdit doesnt close its FILESHAREREAD handle before calling ReplaceFile, then ReplaceFile fails with a sharing violation.p  pId like to know what is the simplest way to resolve this race. The options seem to be either to find another way to lock the file that is compatible with ReplaceFile I dont see how this is possible or to replicate all the behaviour of ReplaceFile, but using an existing file handle to access the destination file rather than a path. Im a bit stuck on how all of the operations of ReplaceFile could be carried out atomically from user code and reimplementing ReplaceFile seems a bad idea anyway.p  pThis must be a common problem, so probably theres an obvious solution that Ive missed.p  pThis question seems related but has no answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32532399Transactionally write a file change on Windowsa.p  hr  pHeres a minimal verifiable example showing what I am trying to achieve updated 1318 3092015 UTC.

So its perfectly possible to replace a file that another process has open even if that other process doesnt allow FILESHAREWRITE, which was Hans point.p  pBut FooEdit is trying to ensure no other process can open the file with GENERICWRITE emin the first placeem. To ensure in FooEdit that theres no race where another process can open the replacement file with GENERICWRITE, it seems that FooEdit has to keep hold emcontinuouslyem of a FILESHAREREAD  FILESHAREDELETE handle to emlpReplacementFileNameem, which then precludes use of ReplaceFile.p
Positive 889 pWere running a Windows Service which is responsible for monitoring a set of processes. The service is basically just responsible for a checking if the defined jobs are running, and b starting the jobs if they are not.p  pThe service is created via the following command sc a hrefhttpstechnet.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb490995.aspx relnofollowhttpstechnet.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb490995.aspxap  precodesc create My Service binPath Cheyoomyservice.exe type own start auto error normal sc start SCF Service codepre  pOne of the jobs the service is responsible for creating is Camera.exe.

Positive 889 pImagine there is an application that has a window with a fixed size, where all controls remain at exactly known places yes, there are such applications. Now imagine that said applications window is quite small and almost unusable on a touchscreen device. My idea now is to build a simple WPF UI, that maps certain controls of the external application to a touchfriendly UI.p  pAnd this is actually not about gaming, but rather about making music. I want to use the small external application live on stage...p  pI found a whole bunch of ways of controlling external applications, most of them getting an handle to the external applications window, then getting a handle to a button, then performing a mouse click on that, like in answers provided to the following questionsp  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5522247controlexternalwindowinvisualstudiocsharpControl external window in visual studio cali lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4715335howtogetthehandleof3rdpartyapplicationsbuttonusingcHow to get the handle of 3rd party application39s button using cali ul  pOther answers propose to move the mouse to the desired location and then perform certain mouse eventsp  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10355286programmaticallymouseclickinanotherwindowprogrammatically mouse click in another windowali lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4715335howtogetthehandleof3rdpartyapplicationsbuttonusingcHow to get the handle of 3rd party application39s button using cali ul  pAll of these approaches have drawbacks Sometimes they need to know the target applicationss structure.

Positive 889 pI am working on a mostly computebound application.  For simplicity, think of it as a set of worker threads pulling blocks of work off an atomic queue, processing them, and then combining them back together in an output buffer.p  pIn my tests, I have a Windows 7 machine with a 6core Intel 990x 12 hardware threads, and so I create 12 threads.p  pHere are some graphs of the performance three trials a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comI0ZPJ.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comI0ZPJ.png alttrial onea a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comvnpVo.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvnpVo.png alttrial twoa a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comaq2hi.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comaq2hi.png alttrial threeap  pAfter a serial initialization phase, you can see the 12 threads all start pulling work, work in parallel, and then terminate when theres none left.  Thread contention appears in orange theres practically none.p  pHowever, notice the weird square wave pattern that occurs occasionally a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comyjrIi.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyjrIi.png altsquare waveap  pThis translates into a significant performance loss.  In trials where it doesnt happen very often, the performance is significantly faster.p  hr  pOne thing Ive noticed is that the waves like to trade off with each otherthat is, the peaks of one thread coincide with the troughs of another.p  pThis suggests one worker thread is being preempted by another.  This is bad, since the CPU has enough resources to run all 12 threads at the same time.p  pTherefore, my suspicion is that this is an OSlevel thread scheduling issue.  If not, what is it  What should I look into to start fixing itp

Positive 889 pIm using the Windows API method codeMonitorFromWindowhwnd, MONITORDEFAULTTONEARESTcode as part of some overridden maximize functionality in my WPF application. One issue weve had with it is that the nearest window does not updating during drag operations triggered by codeDragMovecode on the Window instance. p  pSuppose you drag the window between two screens of differing resolution and trigger the Aero Snap functionality on the second screen. This triggers a query on the window size message codeWMGETMINMAXINFOcode. Using codeMonitorFromWindowcode in this scenario returns the wrong screen. Its as if the data used by codeMONITORDEFAULTTONEARESTcode is not updated until the drag operation completes, and that doesnt complete until the resize function triggered by the Aero Snap completes. Is there some way to flush the current window position before answering the codeWMGETMINMAXINFOcode queryp
Positive 889 pRIO here stands for the Windows 8 Registered IO Networking extensions.

Negative 889 pIm seeing a few questions related to this on SO already, but I think mine is sufficiently different to not be considered a duplicate if Im wrong let me know.p  pI have an ActiveX control Ive written in C and while I have it mostly working, I want to raise an event in JavaScript when its clicked it displays an image so its a visual element on the page. p  pThe end goal of what Im looking to accomplish is no different than if it were a codeltspangtcode tag and it had an codeonclickcode event to raise a JavaScript function when the area of the tag were clicked.p  pMost of the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions150814howtohandleanactivexeventinjavascript379872379872stuff Ive reada on it goes into very fine detail on how to handle events in an ActiveX control and send info backforth, and thats fine, but it seems overly complicated. Im not looking to communicate with the ActiveX control, I just need a JavaScript function to fire off when I click it, in a way similar to a codeltspangtcode or codeltdivgtcode tag. I can handle everything else in JavaScript. Simply wrapping the control in a codeltspangtcode or codeltdivgtcode with an codeonclickcode event has no effect  the ActiveX control pretty much overrides it.p  pIs there a simple way to handle this for an ActiveX control written in Cp  pI guess another way of putting it is  Im working with a third party control and we have to use code similar to the following to get it to communicate with our HTML page via JavaScriptp  precodeltscript typetextjavascript eventOnMouseClickindex forAXObjectNamegt          lt          AXObjectNameOnMouseClickindex         gt ltscriptgt codepre  pWhere codeAXObjectNamecode is the nameid of the control and codeAXObjectNameOnMouseClickcode is the name of the JavaScript function it will fire in my code, passing an codeindexcode parameter. However, what all do I have to do to set up a method like codeOnMouseClickcode in the control And if I dont want to pass any actual information i.e., no codeindexcode do I even have to go this farp

Negative 889 pWhat are some iPhone or Android applications that use SMS as their primary means of user authenticationp  pIm interested to see such apps in action. SMSauth seems like a natural approach that is wellsituated to mobile contexts.p  pThe basic workflow is to sign up, a user provides a phone number the app calls a backend webservice which generates a signed URL and sends it to the phone number via an SMS gateway the user receives the SMS, clicks the link, and is thus verified and logged in. This results in a very strong user identity that is difficult to spoof yet fairly easy. It can be paired with a username or additional account attributes as needed for the product requirements.p  pDespite the advantages, this does not seem to be in much use  hence my question. My initial assumption is that this is because products and users are wary of asking for  providing phone numbers, which users consider sensitive information. That said, I hope this becomes an increasingly more commonplace approach.p

Negative 889 pIve experienced the following scenario when using NHibernate with SQL Server 2005.p  pI have a business process which involves the following stepsp  ol liStart transactionli liCreate nhibernate mapped objectli liSave nhibernate mapped objectli liPerform other business workflow stepsli liUpdate nhibernate mapped object in step 2li liCommit transactionli ol  pIn a single threaded environment this works fine.  However when running a multithreaded load test which performs the same use case on separate entities  I found that I encountered a number of deadlocks.  The transaction isolation level was left on the default setting of read committed. p  pUpon investigation ive found that the cause of the problem is that nhibernate issues an insert amp update statement for the entity created in step 2 amp updated in step 5.  From further testing I understand that the update statement is locking the whole table amp not just the rows being updated, this then leads to deadlocks when another thread tries to access the table for an insert or update. p  pQ1 Is it possible to get nhibernate to just lock the rows it is updating i.e apply a row lock when issuing an updatep  pAs yet Ive not found a way of getting nhibernate to just run a single insert statement as opposed to an insert and then update statement.  p  pQ2 Does anyone know of a configuration option to alter this behaviourp  pIve managed to get over the problem of deadlocks occuring on the multithreaded load test by switching on snapshot isolation on my SQL Server database and setting the transaction isolation level to snapshot.   p  pId be interested to hear if anyone has experienced any similar issues.p

Negative 889 pI have a javascript file that I minify using the Yahoo YUI. When I Publish the web application project, I want it to only copy the .min.js file and not the original one too. I can use a prebuild event to create the minified version, but how do I prevent Publish from copying the non minify filep  pI suppose I can exclude the original non minified file from the project, but that would not be helpful because I want to edit the script file through VS 2010, but when I publish I want the minifier to run first and then publish only that.p  pAny pointers appreciatedp

Negative 889 pIm having a problem with my ListView in a ListActivity with a Custom ArrayAdapter.p  pWhen the ListActivity becomes hidden paused, whatever, the data that was present in the ArrayAdpater seems to go away.  Rotation works fine, but I am only assigning the array in the ArrayAdapter in the onCreate, nowhere else.  The array is stored in a global static so the array itself should be fine.  but the ListView seems to be pitching the array somewhere after the onCreate in the Activity Lifecycle.p  pIm thinking the array should be reassigned on one of the onResume, onStart or onRestart, but Im looking for a more concrete reason as this happens only rarely and never with my Cursor based Adapters.p

Negative 889 pIm writing a formbuilder for our CMS which dynamically loads bespoke controls into panels within a repeater.p  pThe bespoke controls all inherit from, lets say 5arx.FormBuilder.FormControl, a base class which defines abstract methods for initialising, validating, repopulating, gathering submitted data from them. Controls range from simple text fields to complex, composite clientside controls.p  pIt all works very well, but Ive noticed something I feel is anomalous. During the course of writing code to retrieve form controls. gather their data and persist it to my database I noticed that their type reverts to the way objects get typed if you write your code in the v. irritating VS website project mode.p  pSo, for example a control that is defined as living in a namespace and being of typep  pstrikecode5arx.FormBuilder.FormControl.MyBespokeControlcodestrike     Sarx.FormBuilder.FormControl.MyBespokeControlp  pat runtime reports its type via simple call to GetType as being of typep  pstrikecodeASP.5arxFormBuilderFormControlMyBespokeControlcodestrike     ASP.SarxFormBuilderFormControlMyBespokeControlp  pGetting the BaseType property will correctly retrieve the underlying class, but it is perplexing to me why this should be happening.

As Ive said above  all unit tests went 100 fine, both the tests and the executable calling the code are being built by MSVC 2005 in debug mode  the issue can definitely not be attributed to compiler differences.p  pUpdate To clarify  the overloaded codeAddcode functions are not exported and only used internally within the DLL. In other words, the external program which encounters this issue does not even include the head with the template overloaded function.p

Negative 889 pI am creating a basic data transfer task using TSQL where I am retrieving certain records from one database that are more recent than a given datetime value, and loading them into another database. This will happen periodically throughout the day.p  pIts such a small task that SSIS seems like overkill  I want to just use a scheduled task which runs a .sql file.p  pWhere I need guidance is that I need to persist the datetime from the last run of this task, then use this to filter the records next time the task runs. My initial thought is to just store the datetime in a text file, and update overwrite it as part of the task each time it runs.p  pI can read the file in without problems using TSQL, but writing back out has got me stuck. Ive seen plenty of examples which make use of a dynamicallybuilt bcp command, which is then executed using xpcmdshell. Trouble is, security on the server Im deploying to precludes the use of xpcmdshell.p  pSo, my question is, are there other ways to simply write a datetime value to a file using TSQL, or should I be thinking about a different approachp  pEDIT happy to be corrected about SSIS being overkill...p

Negative 889 pI am developing a very simple application that parses an XML feed, does some formatting and then displays it in a TextBlock.

Negative 889 pIm looking for insight into best practices regarding database scripting for modifications that go out along side other code changes for a software system.p  pI used to work for a company that insisted that every roll out has a roll back ready in case of issues. This sounds sensible, but in my opinion, the roll back code for database modifications deployed via scripts has the same likely hood of failing as the roll out script.p  pFor managed code, version control makes this quite simple, but for a database schema, rolling back changes is not so easy  especially if data is changed as part of the roll out.p  pMy current practice is to test the roll out code by running against a test database during late stage development, and then run the application against that test database. Following this, I back up the live DB, and proceed with the roll out.p  pIm yet to run into a problem, but am wondering how other shops manage database changes, and what the strategy is for recovering from any bugs. p

Negative 889 pHow can I tell jQuery to automatically use jsonp for crossdomain ajax requests while it keeps using json for samedomain requests I want to write a client library in javascript which uses jsonp only when necessary. Lets take this small snippet as an examplep  precodejQuery.ajaxurl,      dataType jsonp  codepre  pWhen data type is jsonp then jquery always uses jsonp but already automatically detects if it can send a normal Ajax request for samedomain requests or if it has to use javascript injection for crossdomain request.p  pSo it seems jQuery is already able to autodetect this and decides which technique to use. But it is not necessary to use jsonp when a standard Ajax request is possible so I want to use jsonp only for crossdomain requests. How can I do thisp  pOr maybe it is possible to ask jQuery if a url is crossdomain or not Then I could check this myself and call jQuery.ajax with different data types.p

Negative 889 pI have a need to do some fairly simple at least on the surface data acquisition and logging.  In a remote location as in, on another continent, there will be a few RS485 devices our custom hardware product using a proprietary protocol, plus a weather station anemometer and vane.  For the weather station, I have a couple of options one outputs wind speed as a squarewave frequency and direction as an analog voltage the other communicates over USB using an HID interface.  The machine to which these devices connect needs to collect data, log it, and periodically transmit it over the Internet through a WiFi connection.  This transmission can be either push or pull  that is, I can periodically access the machine remotely to pick up the latest data, or the machine can periodically upload the data to an FTP site or Web service.  This machine needs to be installed in an attic, so it needs to work reliably without babysitting, and it needs to survive the environment temperature, humidity, critters.p  pI have a .NET application that does most of this already, written against .NET 4.  Its a GUI interactive application that displays the measured data and logs it to a file.  I actually have two versions of it with minor differences  one Winformsbased, and the other WPF.p  pIve got about a week to develop the solution for the remote install, including identifying and purchasing any necessary equipment, doing any necessary coding, and making it work.  Oh, and it has to be cheap.  Like, less than 500 would be nice.  Anything over 1,000 is going to be a nonstarter.p  pSome things Ive thought of or has been suggested to mep  ul libUse a cheap netbook with an RS485toUSB interface.b Well, imaybei  but I really dont expect this to hold up in the environment.  The hard drive isnt going to like extreme heat or cold, for example.  An SSD is an option, but thats at least another 100, and I still dont have confidence that the machines going to hold up to the humidity and critters.  I could put it in an enclosure, but thats yet another expense.  Allinall, I just have the feeling this approach is way more expensive and complicated than it needs to be and not likely to be that reliable.li libUse a small singleboard or industrial computer.b These are typically ruggedized, and many have RS485 ports and watchdog timers built in.  Some even have generalpurpose digital IOs.  I havent found any with analog voltage input so far, but those probably exist as well.  Also, they typically use a CompactFlash card for storage.  This feels like the right nearterm approach, but the ones that run Windows typically run some embedded version of it like Windows CE or Windows XP Embedded  which is probably great, except that I have no experience with these and dont know how much work it will be to get my software up and running on it.  Also, they typically have very lowpowered processors, and I dont really know what kind of power I need.  My app runs just fine on a modern desktop I dont have a clue whether it will also work fine on one of these lowend CPUs.  Some of these advertise that theyre compatible with .NET 2.0, but I havent seen anything past that, so at the very least Id probably have to backport everything to .NET 2.0.  Oh, and many of these computers that Ive found so far are quite expensive.li libUse a a hrefhttpwww.digi.comproductsserialserversconnectporttsw.jsp relnofollowwireless serial servera.b These things put a serial port on the network.  You can connect to it remotely, and the serial port appears to be a local COM port, even though it may be located anywhere in the world. This is isort ofi an option for the RS485 stuff.  It avoids the issue of having to remotely administer a PC and make my software work remotely.  However, Im concerned about the bandwidth and reliability of an Internet connection to the other side of the world, and this doesnt help with the USB HID device.  Although, if this turns out to otherwise be a good approach, I might be able to find an RS485 version of that device.li libUse a data logger.b These, also, appear to be fairly expensive  especially those with WiFi  and I havent found any that do everything I need. In particular, the high data rate and proprietary protocol of our RS485 devices appears to be an obstacle. Many of these are designed to work with MODBUS devices. The USB HIDbased weather station wouldnt work with this approach, so Id have to use the one that outputs frequency and voltage.li libUse a lowcost embedded microcontroller solution.b Long term e.g. future projects, this is probably the best approach.  Its cheap, and I can program it to do exactly what I need.  I dont see myself pulling this one off in a week, though. Thats a total rewrite of my software and getting up to speed on the new CPU and development environment.li ul  pDoes anyone have any experience with this sort of problem Whats the simplest, cheapest, most reliable way you can think of to pull this off What products or approaches should I look atp

Negative 889 pI am developing openGL application on iPad and i came up to one quite large problem. I used already existing posts to learn that i can use UILabel to generate text into opengl texture, so i did that. The problem appeared when i had to use five or more labels in different places of texture. When my application must generate five of those textures consisting of five labels each it takes some power. I generate one texture in one loop max, but that creates a small lag. When i load five textures, the lag gets five times more irritating. p  pNow when i told the story, let me ask you a questionp  pHow could i relieve my CPU and perhaps generate text in some other way Its static, just for displaying info. p  pI did try using other thread, but i came up to even more problems, so i would rather prefer some text generating alternative that multi threading. p  pHere is a part of that texture generatorp  precode DATE  [dateLabel setBoundsCGRectMake0, 0, 95, 10] [dateLabel setFrameCGRectMake0, 0, 95, 10] [dateLabel setBackgroundColor[UIColor clearColor]] [dateLabel setFont[UIFont systemFontOfSize12]] [dateLabel setLineBreakModeUILineBreakModeWordWrap] [dateLabel setNumberOfLines1] dateLabel.textColor  [UIColor whiteColor]  dateLabel.text  [self.delegate dateAtIndexindex]  UIGraphicsBeginImageContextCGSizeMake95, 10      [dateLabel.layer renderInContextUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext]  [dateLabel release]  We can now release the view UIImage date  UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext  UIGraphicsEndImageContext codepre  pAs you can see, i set the position, size, text and then create UIImage out of it. I create even more of those images five in fact, and then i render all those images to other context which is my last texture.p  pPerhaps my lack of experience led me to some stupid solution here.p

However, I dont like it for two reasonsp  pa We inadvertent test part of Bar class while testing Foo class.

Its a Bar class which have a problem.p  pb I dont like that production code is used in Assert new Bar1.

Negative 889 pI have a custom Form Ive made that extends the Doctrine base forms for a Doctrine object.p  pI have a database field that is type boolean. For my form, I have this represented by a codesfWidgetFormInputCheckboxcode widget. When my form is submitted, the value of my checkbox comes back as codeoncode if it was checked and if it wasnt checked, then no value is passed. Either way, when I do my codeformgtsavecode, the boolean field is not affected. SymfonyDoctrine wants to see a codetruecode or codefalsecode. Not a codeoncode or no value at all.p  pMy solution is just to see if the value was passed at all and if so, then that field is codetruecode else codefalsecodep  precodevalues[myfield]  issetvalues[myfield]  true  false codepre  pIs this the proper way to handle this I would think that SymfonyDoctrine would already understand how to handle checkboxes.

CREATE TABLE challenges      id INT,     name VARCHAR,     PRIMARY KEY id,     UNIQUE KEY name  CREATE TABLE participant      challengeId INT,     userId INT,     isOwner BIT,     PRIMARY KEY challengeId, userId  codepre  pThe problem with the first approach is that referential integrity is tough since now there are two columns where userIds reside ownerId and rivalId. Id have to create two tables for everything ownerentries, rivalentries, ownerstats, etc. in order to set up foreign keys.p  pThe second approach solves this and has some advantages like allowing multiple rivals in the future. However, one thing I cant do anymore with that approach is enforce Challenge name uniqueness across a single user instead of the whole Challenge table. Additionally, tasks like finding a Challenges owner is now trickier.p  pWhats the right approach to the Challenges table Is there anyway to set up these tables in a developer friendly manner or should I just jump all the way to Class Table Inheritance and manage the concept of OwnerRivals therep

Negative 889 pIm absolutely new to Sharepoint programming, so I need a bit of guidance on how to get a list of all documents that exist within a Sharepoint site whos extension matches a value being passed in.p  hr  pBackground  As part of a merger, millions 7TB of documents were imported into Sharepoint without regard to file type, simply so we could get that data stored from a system that was being shut down.  p  pIncluded in these documents were dangerous file types like .exe, and .dll files, which we need to preserve but want to take proper steps to ensure malicious files of those types arent directly downloadable.  p  pOur plan is to extract each file matching our search list, zip it, upload the zip and delete the original. To do this, we need a one shot application.p  pThere are actually multiple sites involved  so ideally Id love to run one query to access all documents in all sites theyre all under one root but they each have their own databases but Im fine with iterating across a set of sites.p  hr  pMy thinking is to use the Sharepoint Client Object Model to execute a query against each site to give me back a list of all files of a given type.  I want emsomethingem like p  precodeSharepointSite site  new SharepointSitesiteElement, settings.RootURL ClientContext clientContext  site.Context ListCollection listCollection  clientContext.Web.Lists clientContext.LoadlistCollection, lgtl.Name.EndsWith.exe clientContext.LoadlistCollection clientContext.ExecuteQuery codepre  pbut thats definitely not it.p  pHow should I approach this issuep

Negative 889 pProbably a n00b question but take a look at the following codep  precodefunction admindelete  id        if thisgtUsergtdeleteid              thisgtSessiongtsetFlashThe user with id  . id .  has been deleted         thisgtredirectarraycontroller gt users, action gt adminindex       codepre  pNow as far as Im concerned this would load the admindelete view and then WHEN a user deletes the user it does the stuff inside the if statement. But it does the delete straight away Why As its just checking if the delete has taken place and their is nothing in the method to say actually delete it. So why does the code inside an if statement just automatically run like that if no conditionals return true or the function delete is being called outside of the if statement p  pCheersp

They will be able to use the basic app itself without login or creating an account but in order to talk to the server and have their data stored they will need to create an account.p  pSo far Ive looked for the past couple of days and most threads here or other forums talk mostly about using the google account for doing things which is great for a simple app but the project I am working on is anything but simple pp  pSo.....can the wonderful people of stack overflow direct me to information regarding the process of creating a user account on the app that would correlate to one on a server that can talk to and login to a service that is hosted on that same server. That would be great....thanks p

Negative 889 pI have a BSP tree loaded into memory. I first find out what leaf I am in. Next, I decode the PVS. Then, I run through each region in that PVS and see if it lies within my frustum.p  pI have been told that this is the incorrect way to render and that I should actually be doing a back to front rendering by traversing the BSP tree. How exactly do I do this I have seen a number of different methods of doing this, thats why I ask.p  pFor instance, the Quake 3 BSP rendering says Traverse the BSP to determine in which leaf the camera is positioned. Retrieve and decompress the PVS for this leaf, iterate through PVS and mark leaves in the BSP. Traverse the BSP near to far If a Node is not marked, skip it.

Negative 889 pI have a simple post AR classtable. Its based on the blog tutorial so it serves the same purpose.  I want to be able to embed images into posts. My design was as follows and I wasnt entirely happy with it so Ill be happy for your feedbackp  pstrongDesign suggestionstrong Directory strongprotecteddatapostsfilespostidstrong would be the repository of posts resources images in our case, but can be anything. Post authors need to put the used imagesfiles in the right location after the post is created since its id is needed. My needs are really humble so from convenience point of view this is ok. When a post that include such images is requested, CAssetManager will be called to the rescue, to publish the directory of that post e.g. protecteddatapostsfiles17. In the posts themselves in their content or body  which ever term you prefer, images will be embedded with strongimgstrong tags that the src attribute pointing to the published directory for this postid in the assets folder for example, after publishing a specific post, strongWEBROOTassetsd379e294someimage.gifstrong.p  pProblem is that when the post is creatededited, I do not know what path the CAssetManager will create and return  that seemingly random text string strongd379e294strong in the example above. So, I need on runtime, when loading the post, to update its content live, after publishing has been made, with the correct urlpaths in the src attribute of the img tags or for every other kind of resource linked in that post.p  pThis was a little challenging Initially I went with a PHP variable in the post contentbody and tried to somehow interpolate it when loading or just before rendering the post. I wasnt successful. I used PHPs strongevalstrong, which is very bad practice and dangerous by itself, and it kept crashing complaining on the other content within the post body.  I resorted to have some simple place holder string in the body of the posts  strongASSETSURLstrong and strongstrreplacestrong it when loading the post with the published assets path that I now have at hand at runtime. p  pIm not sure this is the best approach. this place holder string could be needed in some post and besides, that seems like a basic templating engine start and my intuition tells me Im missing something if I do a simple templating engine inside a framework. I just can pin point on the right alternative, the best practice alternative, to do it in Yii.  I wanted to ask for your opinion on this  both on the design of the solution from the higher level and on the design of the implementation itself. Would you change things and make them differentp  pI didnt want to dive into KcFinder so intentionally left it out.p  pThanks, Boaz. p

Negative 889 pI am looking for a suitable algorithm to build a relatively small up to 255 elements sorted array of integers. The target platform is a STM32 based embedded system. Since memory is limited, an inplace method is preferred.p  pI am aware that the obvious way is implement and profile the usual suspects quick sort, insert sert, shell sort, but would like to ask for your experiences nevertheless. More specifically I have found very little information on the performance when embuildingem the array  that is, how well different algorithms may use the fact that all existing elements are already ordered.p  pstrongEdit 1strong  Although the question is tagged C the STL is not available. Furthermore, the sorting does indeed occur inside a inner loop. To further clarify, I am looking for an algorithm that is especially suited to embuildem a sorted list in an efficient manner. I assume maybe wrongly there must be algorithms specially suited for this task. Thats the question. p  pstrongEdit 2strong When saying embuildingem a sorted list I mean that the list starts empty and is filled by by a bounded number max 255 of 16bit integers which are in no particular order. The list must be processed after all elements have been stored. For processing the list must be sorted, preferably in descending order.   p  pThanks in advance, Arnep

Looking at the C source code for the addin, this is stored in a class variable named codesprintNumbercodep  precodenamespace Scrum      public delegate void SprintAddedobject sender, EventArgs e      public partial class AddNewSprint  Form              public event SprintAdded onSprintAdded          private Microsoft.Office.Interop.MSProject.Application application              null         private int sprintNumber  1 codepre  pThere is also a dropdown list in the ribbon menu that displays this number. But I have no idea how to access either the class variable or the AddIn created dropdown list.p  pIs this even possible, or am I going to have to purchase Visual Studio and learn C, or is there an easier way to go about this that Im overlookingp

Negative 889 pI have two development branches in git and I frequently need to change between the two. However, the really frustrating thing is that every time I change branches in git, the entire project gets rebuilt because the filesystem timestamps for some files will change. p  pOfc, the makefiles are configured to build the project into two different build directories .p  pIs there any way around this Compilation is a very long and timeconsuming process... p  pEdit This is a slightly more detailed explanation of the question...  Say I have a header files Basic.h which is included in a number of other files. Basic.h is different between branch 1 and branch 2. p  pNow lets say I have compiled branch 1 into buildbranch1 and branch 2 into buildbranch2. Say I have branch 2 currently checked out. Now I checkout branch 1 and change File1.cpp and recompile. Ideally, since only File1.cpp has changed since I compiled it the last time, this is the only file that should be recompiled.p  pHowever, since Basic.h has its timestamp changed due to the checkout, all files that are including Basic.h will get recompiled. I want to avoid this. p

It is an older application and I dont really want to have to try to update Rails and Comma just to fix this little issue as previous attempts to update Comma did not go well.

Something like  p  pDate, Time, Site, Question 1, Question 2, ..., Question N  p  pThe above code does this, however the question function, which handles creating the data for each question column needs to be passed a parameter, and I dont know of anyway to do this with Comma since the above syntax is what I would expect to do to pass a parameter, but apparently Comma handles this data a little differently.p  pIve tried  p  precodeQuestion.findall.each do q     questionq q.identifier end codepre  pANDp  precodeQuestion.findall.each do q     question q q.identifier end codepre  pBut all I get are a syntax error expecting keywordend for the first and unknown header [q.identifier] for the second.p  pI had thought that I could handle this problem by accessing the q variable inside of the question function because it should still be scope but apparently not because I just receive an error telling me that the variable does not exist.p  pAny help is appreciated and if I need to post more info, let me know.

Negative 889 pI am currently trying to create a blue, circular, piechartesque image for my website. The circle will be split into 6 different segments.p  pWhat I want to happen is that when the user hovers over a particular segment, this segment will turn orange, and some text will appear beside the circle corresponding to that segment.p  pI have found some resources online which achieve nearly the effect I need using CSS image maps. a hrefhttpwww.noobcube.comtutorialshtmlcsscssimagemapsabeginnersguide relnofollowhttpwww.noobcube.comtutorialshtmlcsscssimagemapsabeginnersguidea However, these techniques split up an image using rectangles. If I were splitting up a circular object I would prefer to split up the area based on particular arcs.p  pI assume this is beyond the reach of pure HTML and CSS. I do not have a great deal of experience with web languages, although I have had passing experience with JQuery. What are the techniques I need to solve my problem and what technology would be best to implement itp

Negative 889 pI cant seem to find whats wrong. here is my codep  precodeNSMutableArray sortedActivities  [NSMutableArray arrayWithCapacityself.trainingSession.activities.count] for ManagedActivity activity in self.trainingSession.activities     [sortedActivities insertObjectactivity atIndex[activity.activityIndex unsignedIntegerValue]] codepre  pas you can see i want to sort the set of activities which is a relation in trainingSession by the a property named activityIndex inside the activity. the indexes of the activities are always from 0 on, that means that none of the indexes exceeds trainSession.activities.count1.p  pi do the sorting by allocating a NSMutableArray with the appropriate capacity, and then iterate over the activities once and insert them to the right index. for some reason that i dont know i get this error p  pTerminating app due to uncaught exception NSRangeException, reason emem [NSArrayM insertObjectatIndex] index 2 beyond bounds for empty arrayp  pi tried retaining the array, it didnt matter and shouldnt matter.p  pthe indexes are correct, the count is correct, what is wrongp
Negative 889 pI have an app which uploads images to a bunch of places at once, kinda like Instagram style.p  pIt is setup with an codeNSOperationQueuecode that runs a bunch of codeNSOperationcode wrappers around an an asynchronous codeNSURLConnectioncode.p  pMost questions that begin like this end in the callbacks dont get called because the calling thread is joined before they return. This is strongnotstrong that kind of question. I emamem getting my callbacks as expected, but I am also somehow preventing the app from backgrounding when the home button is pressed. I always thought this was not able to be blocked at all due to sandboxing, but somehow I have done it. Pressing the home button while the operations are running will do nothing until they are complete, at which point 2030sec later the app properly backgrounds.p  pemNB This seems to only happen on single core processor devices. I can reproduce only on my iPhone 4, but not my 4S or iPad 3.emp  pStill interested Here is my setupp  precodeself.uploadQueue  [[NSOperationQueue alloc] init] [self.uploadQueue setMaxConcurrentOperationCount1] [self.uploadQueue setSuspendedYES] codepre  pLater on, I add operations to the queue and then unsuspend it to start. Here is some code from those codeNSOperationcode subclassesp  precode BOOLisConcurrent  return YES   BOOLisExecuting  return self.executing   BOOLisFinished  return self.finished    voidstart       Omitted check for cancel...

This caused the async connection to not callback the block.li liForcing each NSOperation onto the main thread in the codestartcode method. This did not solve the problem, also caused code to sometime not work and the UI to sometimes freeze.li liImplementing my own queue with a mutable array and GCD to get on the right dispatch thread. Couldnt get it to work.li liSynchronous NSURLConnections in the operations. I didnt really try this because it is not an option for me. Some of the network frameworks such as the Facebook iOS SDK do not have a synchronous option.li ol  pPausing execution during the time after the homebutton press, but before the operations are done yields nothing interesting. There doesnt seem to be anything on the main thread waiting for a lock or execution to finish.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkNRvN.png altThreads 1img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comaVRoY.png altThreads 2p  pAm I setting this up like a complete bozo What is going on here and how can I fix itp

I will outline this issue as best as possible, I dont think at this time posing my question requires me to post any code, but feel free to ask.p  pMy application defaults in Portrait viewing, as most do. In the main interaction area, when the user rotates the device, I dont have to provide code that alters anything major because instead, I place a new view on top of the view stack. This works great and is one of two ways the user can interact with the device in landscape mode.p  pThe second is with a modally presented screen from this main interaction area that plays YouTube videos from within the app with a UIWebView, again this works well. p  pThe problem arises when the user dismisses the modal view controller in Landscape mode. What happens is that the user returns to the main interaction area with the content adjusted for landscape mode, and the delegate method normally called from the view controller for this main interaction area is not called, I use this delegate method to make the landscape change normally p  precode voidwillRotateToInterfaceOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationtoInterfaceOrientation durationNSTimeIntervalduration   codepre  pI will include screenshots of exactly what is happening.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNHgQp.jpg altThe main interaction areap  pemA screenshot of the main interaction area in Portrait Mode.emp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.coma7D5n.jpg altlandscape modep  pemA screenshot of the main interaction area when in Landscape Mode.emp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWSdQg.jpg altlandscape mode upon return from modalp  pemA screenshot of the main interaction area after dismissing the modal view controller in Landscape mode and back to the main interaction area notice the content has centered itself and has cut off the top portion and does not stretch not that im asking it to do thatemp  pIdeally in this situation, I would like to return to the main screen from Landscape mode and have screenshot 2 be what the user sees and not screenshot 3.p  pAny suggestions Again, im glad to post code.

Negative 889 pIn HashSet.java in JDK 1.6, there are some comments about the failfast property of HashSets iterator.p  blockquote   pThe iterators returned by this classs iterator method are failfast if the set is modified at any time after the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterators own remove method, the Iterator throws a ConcurrentModificationException. Thus, in the face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, nondeterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future.p blockquote  pI can understand the above paragraph because Its pretty simple and clear, but I cannot understand the following paragraph. I may understand it if I have some simple examples showing that a failfast iterator can even fail.p  blockquote   pNote that the failfast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Failfast iterators throw ConcurrentModificationException on a besteffort basis. Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this exception for its correctness the failfast behavior of iterators should be used only to detect bugs.p blockquote

Negative 889 pI am looking for a way to search across all folders for the given user.p  pI am aware that the a hrefhttptools.ietf.orghtmlrfc3501section6.4.4 relnofollowIMAP SEARCH commanda requires that you select a mailbox to operate on first  scoping the results of the search to that particular mailbox.p  pThe Javamail IMAP implementation implements a codesearchcode function that operates on a codeFoldercode object.

Negative 889 pIm sending an email using the CakeEmail class in an action of one of my controllers. I have a unit test for this controller that was working fine before adding the email code. After adding the email I get this errorp  blockquote   pSocketException Could not send email.p blockquote  pThis is down to the fact that I dont have any way of sending emails off my local machine.p  pSo I thought that maybe a good idea would be to have two different configuration options inside the EmailConfig class in Configemail.php Similar to how the database config file works. The default using the Mail transport, and a test using the Debug transport. The issue with this is that, unlike the database config, Cake doesnt automatically switch between the two during testing.p  pThe only thing I have thought of is to add a constructor to the EmailConfig class and test if were unit testing, but Im not sure what the check should be.p  pSomething along the lines of thisp  precodeclass EmailConfig       public default  array         transport gt Mail           public test  array         transport gt Debug           public function construct          if isUnitTesting              thisgtdefault  thisgttest                 codepre  pWould my way suggested above be a good idea If not, what other ways can I use a different transport for the email during unit testingp  hr  pstrongUpdate  4102012strongp  pI think I was going about this the wrong way. Looking at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma8600556343465this answera it seems that even the codedefaultcode config isnt loaded by default, you have to specify it by calling the codeCakeEmailconfigcode method or give it in the constructor.

Negative 889 pIm trying to figure out a way I can filter out data in my cube so that I can perform timeseries calculations such as a moving average using only that subset.p  pFor example, lets say that I have a fact table with the following columnsp  ul liDayId Keyli liHourId Keyli liValueli ul  pI also have a Time dimension with a composite key of strongDayIdstrong and strongHourIdstrong.  This dimension has a key for every hour over the span of 100 days, so the keys go from 1,1 to 100,24.p  pIn the fact table there is a value for every point in time so it looks likep  precodeDayId HourId Value 1     1       50 1     2       60 1     3       75.2 ...   ...     ... 100   23      87 100   24      89 codepre  pNow, suppose I want to calculate a daily moving average from the beginning of time through some arbitrary point in the middle of the day.  Basically, I would want to calculate the average using the last point of every day except the last one, which would use a different point in time in the middle of the day.  If I was to do a moving average from day 1 to day 10, ending at noon of the 10th day HourId 12, the data I would use for my calculation would look likep  precodeDayId HourId Value 1     24     80 2     24     90 3     24     39 4     24     60 ...   ...    ... 9     24     10  10    12     30 codepre  pIn SQL, I could retrieve a set like this pretty easilyp  precodeSELECT       FROM     [FactTable] WHERE     DayId BETWEEN 1 AND 9 AND HourId  24     OR DayId  10 AND HourId  12 codepre  pIm pretty new to OLAP and MDX, so Ive really been struggling with the right way to do this.  So far, the best Ive been able to do is to perform a subselect in my codeFROMcode clause, and essentially construct a tuple set of only the rows I wantp  precodeWITH     MEMBER [SMA 10 Value] AS     AVG          [Time].[DayId].Lag9[Time].[DayId], [Time].[HourId]         , [Value]      SELECT            [Value]       , [SMA 10 Value]      ON COLUMNS     , [Time].[DayId], [Time].[HourId] ON ROWS FROM      SELECT         [Measures] ON COLUMNS         ,              [Time].[DayId].[1][Time].[DayId].[9], [Time].[HourId].[24]             , [Time].[DayId].[10], [Time].[HourId].[12]      ON ROWS     FROM         [Cube]  codepre  pHowever, it doesnt seem to quite work right for my calculations.  The moving average seems to be correct over the first 9 days, because their tuples all have the same hour ID, but when I get to the final day, instead of using the values from the previous 9 tuples, it performs the average over the previous 9 days with the 12 Hour ID.p  pWhat am I doing wrong here, is there a better way that I can filter my time dimension down to eliminate unwanted rows from my calculationsp

Negative 889 pIm trying to build an application in ExtJsJavascript and noticed events are good way to keep component independent to each others.

Negative 889 pI am working on a project and am stuck with what I think is a scope and a logic problem.  I am creating a class called Person with four string variables, last name, first name, favorite color, and gender.  I am creating a second class called PersonList with one variable that is an array of Person objects.  I have set a const int called MAX that determines the size of the array currently 3.  Ultimately, I would like to enter a the string variables of a Person object into the newDude object declared in the main.  For instance, when the readNewPerson function runs, I enter Doe, John, Blue, Male.  THIS STEP WORKSp  pNext, I would like this newDude to be copied into the dudesList object declared in the main at address dudesList[0] and the readNewPerson function to run again.  If everything works correctly, I am thinking that Smith, Jane, Pink, Female should get copied to dudesList[1] and Johnson, Mike, Green, Male should get copied to dudesList[2].  Finally, I would like to print all three objects to the console.p  pI am going wrong somewhere in the for loops within the addPersonToList and printList functions where my variable is not iterating properly.  My guess is that since I am declaring the counter i inside the function, it dies and resets to zero every time a newDude is created.  If Im correct about this, where is the best place to declare the counter and when should I iterate itp  pI really appreciate any feedback anyone might be able to offer and I certainly do not want anyone to DO the assignment for me.  I could just use a bit of a push in the right direction at this point as I am incredibly frustrated with what should be a very simple task, at least in concept.p  pHere is my program so farp  precode contact list with oneword strings only  include ltiostreamgt using namespace std  const int MAX  3  class Person        private         string dudesLName         string dudesFName         string dudesColor         string dudesGender     public         void readNewPerson   function declaration to ask for info         void printPerson  function declaration to display info to console   class PersonList        private         Person dudesList [MAX]     public         void addPersonToList Person newDude function declaration to add my newDude to the dudesList array         void printList  function declaration to print the entire array    the main function is a simple switchcase asking for user choices  int main void    Person newDude one object contains 4 simple string variables  PersonList List one object contains an array of [MAX] dudes  int userChoice integer for the users choice in switchcase  cout ltlt Welcome to Stephens Contact List ltlt endl  cout ltlt Please enter your choice ltlt endl  cout ltlt  1  enter  ltlt MAX ltlt  new people ltlt endl  cout ltlt  2  print the contact list ltlt endl  cout ltlt  3  retrieve by last name ltlt endl  cout ltlt  4  retrieve by address ltlt endl  cout ltlt  5  retrieve by gender ltlt endl  cin gtgt userChoice  switch userChoice        case 1         for int i  0 i lt MAX i                          newDude.readNewPerson  function call to enter one persons info             List.addPersonToList newDude function call to add newDude to dudesList array                      break     case 2         cout ltlt 2 doesnt work yet ltlt endl         List.printList  function call to print entire list         break     case 3         cout ltlt 3 doesnt work yet ltlt endl         break     case 4         cout ltlt 4 doesnt work yet ltlt endl         break     case 5         cout ltlt 5 doesnt work yet ltlt endl         break   cout ltlt thanks dude ltlt endl  return 0    function definitions  void PersonreadNewPerson         cout ltlt enter a dudes last name please ltlt endl     cin gtgt dudesLName      cout ltlt enter a dudes first name please ltlt endl     cin gtgt dudesFName      cout ltlt enter a dudes favorite color please ltlt endl     cout ltlt for test purposes, just enter one word ltlt endl     cin gtgt dudesColor      cout ltlt enter a dudes gender please ltlt endl     cout ltlt male or female is fine, so is dude or dudette ltlt endl     cin gtgt dudesGender      return   void PersonprintPerson        cout ltlt dudes name is  ltlt dudesLName ltlt ,  ltlt dudesFName ltlt endl     cout ltlt his her favorite color is  ltlt endl     cout ltlt dudesColor ltlt endl     cout ltlt and his her gender is  ltlt endl     cout ltlt dudesGender ltlt endl ltlt endl     return    void PersonListaddPersonToList Person newDude        for int i  0 i lt MAX i supposed to iterate the array address as it adds Person objects to the array      dudesList [i]  newDude this is where the newDude object is copied to the array      return    void PersonListprintList        for int i  0 i lt MAX i         dudesList [i].printPerson       return   codepre

Negative 889 pIm looking for heap structures for priority queues that can be implemented using codeObject[]code arrays stronginsteadstrong of codeNodecode objects.p  pBinary heaps of course work well, and so do nary heaps. Javas codejava.util.PriorityQueuecode is a binary heap, using an codeObject[]code array as storage.p  pThere are plenty of other heaps, such as Fibonacci heaps for example, but as far as I can tell, these need to be implemented using nodes. And from my benchmarks I have the impression that the overhead paid by managing all these node objects comes at a cost that may well eat up all benefits gained. I find it very hard to implement a heap that can comete with the simple arraybacked binary heap.p  pSo Im currently looking for advanced heap  priority queue structures that also do not have the overhead of using codeNodecode objects. Because I want it to be fast in reality, not just better in complexity theory... and there is much more happening in reality for example the CPU has L1, L2 and L3 caches etc. that do affect performance.p  pMy question also focuses on strongJavastrong for the very reason that I have little influence on memory management here, and there are no codestructcodes as in C. A lot of heaps that work well when implemented in C become costly in Java because of the memory management overhead and garbage collection costs.p

Negative 889 pHip  pIm using Pythons xlwt package to make excel documents. What i need is to put a border around every cell in the document that is between the data.p  pLets say i have written in a cell at row 1 column 1. Then ive written in a cell at row 3 column 1. I can easily set borders to these cells at the same time Im writing stuff into them. But, then, the cell between them, row 2 column 1, doesnt have any borders.p  pHow can this be achieved I thought i can just write an empty string in these cells that are actually empty, and then put borders around them, but i was hoping for a more elegant solution. Maybe theres a simple method in the xlwt package for thisp  pThank you very muchp

Negative 889 pI host a website that has been up and running for years. Its worked fantastically up until now, but in the past couple days I had a very strange error arise.p  pIn my shopping cart on magento, it gives the user the option of typing in the shipping zip code and getting an estimate on shipping. before the problems arose, the estimate shipping cost wouldnt appear until a zip code was typed. Now, it automatically defaults to 30.00 and I cant figure out how to fix it. Im not sure if something was updated, like PHP, Magento, or some extension, but I need it fixed ASAP. Ive been in Magentos admin area and changed shipping options, looked through tax options and everything I could possibly think of. Ive even been in Magentos cart.phtml file and commented out the linep  pcodeif thisgtgetIsVirtual echo thisgtgetChildHtmlshipping endifcodep  pDoing this just takes the estimate shipping out completely. I dont want it out, I just want it to produce an estimate AFTER the zip code is typed in as opposed to before. Im at a loss here, and my boss wants this done tomorrow. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanksp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIve done everything i could possibly think of to fix the problem, even going as far as to completely replace the file with the original clean copy provided by magento. Its still defaulting to 30.00 shipping before anything is pressed on page load. The site is using one step checkout as an extension on magento, and Im completely at a loss with this one. I am guessing that its a bug in the internal software because ive completely replaced all code with clean code except for core functionality of magentoone step checkout.

When I then call codemymodel.namecode, I get the codemymodeltranslation.namecode for the active language. Setting this value is also possible.p  pSince I want to have this being made dynamically so I can use it in a mixin, I added it to a for loop, like sop  precode   def initself, args, kwargs         superModel, self.initargs, kwargs         trans  lambda c c.gettranslation         setattrself.class, translation, propertytrans           returns all fields of the translation model         transfields  [field.name for field in [             related for related in self.meta.getallrelatedobjects             if translation in related.name         ][0].model.meta.fields]           should then assign all those fields dynamically         for name in transfields             if not name  id and not name  mymodel                 fget  lambda c getattrtransc, name                 fset  lambda c, v setattrtransc, name, v                 setattrself.class, name, propertyfget, fset codepre  pSo I thought, okay, since the codenamecode value resembles the name of the field, that I used to add manually before, it should then add a codepropertycode with a name of the value of codenamecode on each run of the for loop. But it does not. When I call codemymodel.namecode it returns the model instance so basically codeselfcode. I have no clue, what is different, when I do it in a forloop instead of all manually.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 889 pI have a String from which I would like to parse an integer and cannot find a way past this runtime exception. I understand that it is meant to display at times when a parseNUMBERTYPE function is applied to an inappropriately defined String, and that blank spaces or letters where the code expects numbers to be can trigger it. However, the String I am using as a test dummy is as far as I can tell simply the numeral 5. I have seen several suggestions in response to other users NumberFormatException problems advocating the application of a trim function before parsing, and I have tried this with no success.p  pI have also tried replacing the String I wish to parse with the simple, unstored value 5.

Negative 889 pIt sounds weird to be going embiggerem, but thats what Im trying to do.  I want to take the entire sequence of 16bit integers and hash each one in such a way that it maps to 256bit space uniformly.p  pThe reason for this is that Im trying to put a subset of the 16bit number space into a 256bit bloom filter, for fast membership testing.p  pI could use some wellknown hashing function on each integer, but Im looking for an extremely efficient implementation just a few instructions so that this runs well in a GPU shader program.  I feel like the fact that the hash input is known to be only 16bits can inform the hash function is designed somehow, but I am failing to see the solution.p  pAny ideasp  hr  pEDITSp  pBased on the responses, my original question is confusing.  Sorry about that.  I will try to restate it with a more concrete examplep  pI have a subset S1 of n numbers from the set S, which is in the range 0, 2161.  I need to represent this subset S1 with a 256bit bloom filter constructed with a single hashing function.  The reason for the bloom filter is a space consideration.  Ive chosen a  256bit bloom filter because it fits my space requirements, and has a low enough probability of false positives.  Im looking to find a very simple hashing function that can take a number from set S and represent it in 256 bits such that each bit has roughly equal probability of being 1 or 0.p  pThe reason for the requirement of simplicity in the hashing function is that this hashing function is going to have to run thousands of times per pixel, so anywhere where I can trim instructions is a win.p

It only happens with javascript files  .css and .cs files in the same project work just fine.  p  pIve tried diffing my project file in source control, and I dont see anything that would cause it there are a lot of changes, because I just updated some nuget packages, but the changes all seemed to just be file includes for the swapped out .js libraries.p  pIve tried the obvious stuff, like rebooting and deleting my .suo file.  For now, I guess its just a nuisance,  but I would like to fix it.  p  pI am running Resharper 8.1, if that could have anything to do with it.p

Negative 889 pI have some hard time implementing traits in C, I tried to follow several examples from the internet but it still doesnt want to compile.p  pI use a codeTermcode class, which contains an codeAttributecode, an codeOperatorcode and sometimes a value. For example, codeage lt 10code or codecolor  redcode are simple terms. Different kinds of attributes or operators exists, that inherits from classes codeAttributecode or codeTermOperatorcode. Since a lot of methods of the codetermcode class will depend on the attribute and the operator, this is a template class. In order to simplify the manipulation of terms, I added an abstract class  codeAbstractTermcodep  precodeclass AbstractTerm  protected     Attribute pAttribute     TermOperator pOperator public     virtual bool evalData  const  0   template lttypename ATT, typename OPgt class Term  AbstractTerm      typedef typename TermTraitsltATT,OPgttype  VALUETYPE private     typename TermTraitsltATT,OPgttype value public     bool evalData  const  codepre  pThe value I need to store in codetermcode will depend on both attribute amp operator, so I use traits to obtain the right type to store the value.p  precodetemplate lt typename ATT, typename OPgt struct TermTraits      typedef int type          template ltgt struct TermTraitsltListAttribute, TermOperatorgt      typedef ListValue type   template ltgt struct TermTraitsltNumericAttribute, TermOperatorgt      typedef NumericIntValue type  codepre  pHowever, in the codeevalcode method when I use codeVALUETYPEcode I dont get the right type p  precodetemplate ltgt bool TermltNumericAttribute, TermOperatorEqualsgtevalData data const       VALUETYPE is a int, but it should be a NumericIntValue     VALUETYPE pValue  datagtgetValueltVALUETYPEgtthisgtpAttributegtgetId     return pValuegtisEmpty ampamp thisgtvalue  pValuegtvalue  I get compilation errors here because pValue is a int and not a NumericIntValue  codepre  pI get the errorp  precodeerror request for member isEmpty in  pValue,  which is of nonclass type TermltNumericAttribute,  TermOperatorExistsgtVALUETYPE aka int.  codepre  pI cant figure out why it doesnt use the specialisation codeTermTraitsltNumericAttribute, TermOperatorgtcode, since codeTermOperatorExistscode inherits from codeTermOperatorcode.p  pTraits are a new concept to me, so maybe I made some obvious mistakes.

Negative 889 pIve built these 3 applications. Each of them collects data from user input and creates a csv file. 2 of them rely on the LEAP motion controller. I am trying to figure out a way to combine them all into one program. Any tips on how I could go about doing this Can I just enclose them into like a class then have the main program call each one individually Or would I need to go in and rewrtie everything to work together Each application makes very different use of the draw with all types of flags and noLoop and Loop calls to pause as necessary to collect data so rewrite all as 1 would be difficult. Furthermore the code is extremely sloppy in its current form. I basically hacked away and pulled together randoms bits to get each one to do what I needed to do. Each one is a mess so combining all into one program seems like it would be a real nightmare.p  pIs there anyway to package them so as one ends the other automatically opens Kinda like how in a webpage you can just link or automatically open another page after one closes Each application just needs to run once so I dont have to worry about going back and forth.p  pEventually Im going to build a visualization that updates in real time with the data from these applications. I think I may build a web application for that part because I want the visualization to be able to be viewed from multiple locationsplatforms.p  pIve included a dropbox link to all the code. Someone suggested embedding the application directly into Java using a Swing Interface. Now Im reading  a hrefhttpwww.sfu.casiatclassIAT355Spring2012LecturesIAT355Lecture10A.pdf relnofollowthisa which I think is explaining how to go about doing this.

The list contains Gradle guava12.0, Gradle hamcrestcore1.3, Gradle jsr3052.0.3, and Gradle junit4.11. I dont want to just click the  button to add a library using IDEA, because I think it would be confusing to have libraries included in two separate ways.p  pIve a hrefhttpswww.google.comsearchqGradlefileTree relnofollowsearched for Gradle fileTreea, but it looks like Im using codefileTreecode the same way as in those results.p  pIm new to Gradle, IDEA, and setting up Java projects from scratch.

Negative 889 pI have shipped an online gridbased videogame that uses the TCP protocol to ensure reliable communication in a serverclient network topology. My game works fairly well, but suffers from higher than expected latency similar TCP games in the genre seem to do a better job at keeping latency to a minimal. p  pWhile investigating, I discovered that the latency is only unexpectedly high for clients running emMicrosoft Windowsem as opposed to emMac OS Xem clients. Furthermore, I discovered that if a Windows client sets a hrefhttplifeandcode.net200905reducegamenetworklatencyinwindows7orvistacodeTcpAckFrequency1code in the registrya and restarts their machine, their latency becomes normal.p  pIt would appear that my network design did not take into account delayed acknowledgementp  blockquote   pA design that does not take into account the interaction of strongdelayed acknowledgmentstrong, the Nagle algorithm, and Winsock buffering can drastically effect performance.   a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb214397httpsupport.microsoft.comkb214397ap blockquote  pHowever, Im finding it nearly impossible to take into account delayed acknowledgement in my game or any game. According to MSDN, the Microsoft TCP stack uses the following criteria to decide when to send one ACK on received data packetsp  blockquote   ul   liIf the second data packet is received before the delay timer expires 200ms, the ACK is sent.li   liIf there are data to be sent in the same direction as the ACK before the second data packet is received and the delay timer expires,   the ACK is piggybacked with the data segment and sent immediately.li   liWhen the delay timer expires 200ms, the ACK is sent.li   ul      pa hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb214397httpsupport.microsoft.comkb214397ap blockquote  pReading this, one would presume that the workaround for delayed acknowledgement on Microsofts TCP stack is as followsp  ol liDisable the Nagle algorithm TCPNODELAY.li liDisable the sockets send buffer codeSOSNDBUFcode0, so that a call to codesendcode can be expected to send a packet.li liWhen calling codesendcode, if no further data is expected to be sent immediately, call codesendcode again with a singlebyte of data that will be discarded by the receiver.li ol  pWith this approach, the second data packet will be received by the receiver at around the same time as the previous data packet. As a result, the codeACKcode should get sent immediately from the receiver to the sender emulating what codeTcpAckFrequency1code does in the registry.p  pHowever, from my testing, this improved latency only by about a half of what the registry edit does. What am I missingp  phr bQ Why not use UDPbp  pbAb I chose TCP because every packet I send needs to arrive and be in order there are no packets that arnt worth retransmitting if they get lost or become unordered.

This is not my code, Im trying to make it better.  Operation 1 or each case is a series of commands, and I want to put them in their own translation units one function per file.p  pSince myonce runs in a loop, the original author has many static variables that he uses to keep state, some of these state sets are used across multiple operations.  Note that these are not static file scope, they are static block scope.p  pTo keep things simple, as a proof of concept, I want to know if the following is possible. Consider 1 operation with 1 set of static vars.p  pmain.cppp  precodemyonce     static int i for op 1    switchcommandid         case 1  operation1 codepre  poperation1.cppp  precodeextern int i void operation1     i  1  codepre  pIn the case of multiple operations using the same sets of state, I would make a header to declare them all extern.p  pCurrently compilation of this file is counted in minutes, and my first goal is to break it up into smaller compilation units so that the author can work more freely.  this refactoring will take a long time, but I mention this as an explanation of my motivation of this approach.p  pI understand that a static file scope variable is not accessible to other translation units extern in other files, so I wish to distinguish that this is not the case Im handling.

Negative 889 pHey Im having some trouble managing multiple instances of the same class in a java program.

Negative 889 pI have an application in which an Android device is connected to a data acquisition system and the data is stored in a local db.  I want to monitor in real time the data on a second Android as well.  In order to enhance performance, I set up my own Apache server XAMPP on a Windows machine.  I wrote two php scripts one to store data in Memcache and one to get data from memcache.  The Android devices are using HttpClient to call the scripts.  I used memcache in order to eliminate some delays of writing to database.  Below is the code used for sending and receiving the data...  For testing, it is a simple loop counter with a thread delay.  If I set the delay for 1 second, the textview is updated and runs smoothly.  When I drop the delay to 0.1 seconds, it runs fine for a few seconds and then stutters pauses for 35 seconds.  It continues this process of intermittent pausing while running.  If I drop the delay to 0.01 seconds, the system crashes.  My Apache server is connected to directly to my router.  The Android devices are connected to my WiFi.  My question is whether or not Im doing something fundamentally wrong.  I thought with memcache, I would easily be able to do 0.01 s sampling of data.  Is my code properly handling the AsyncTasks  How can I prevent the Android system from apparently becoming overloaded with new tasks  It is as if I need a method to determine when a task is complete such that the next task can be called.  I appreciate any feedback regarding php, httpclient, etc...anything that affects performance. p  pEDIT  My system no longer crashes when I drop the delay to 0.01 sec.  I now have a catch for the null value in the onpostexecute method.  However, I still get stuttersfreezes.p  precode    private void startsendingdata              loop  0             if sendingdatathread  null                 sendingdatathread.interrupt             sendingdatathread  new Thread                  public void run                      while loop lt 5000                          try                              runOnUiThreadnew Runnable                                   Ov  erride                             public void run                                  new SendDataTask.execute                                 loop                                 myvar  Integer.toStringloop                                                                               Thread.sleep1000                      catch InterruptedException e                          e.printStackTrace                         break                                                                      sendingdatathread.start            private class SendDataTask extends AsyncTaskltString, Integer, Doublegt           Override         protected Double doInBackgroundString... params              postData             return null                   protected void onPostExecuteDouble result                    public void postData              try                  ListltNameValuePairgt nameValuePairs  new ArrayListltNameValuePairgt                  put all variables here with connection code attached                 nameValuePairs.addnew BasicNameValuePairconnectioncode,                         connectioncode                  nameValuePairs.addnew BasicNameValuePairmyvar, myvar                  httppostsend                         .setEntitynew UrlEncodedFormEntitynameValuePairs                 response  httpclient.executehttppostsend                 response.getEntity.consumeContent               catch UnsupportedEncodingException e                  e.printStackTrace              catch ClientProtocolException e                  e.printStackTrace              catch IOException e                  e.printStackTrace                                   private void startgettingdata           if gettingdatathread  null             gettingdatathread.interrupt         gettingdatathread  new Thread              public void run                  while true                      try                          runOnUiThreadnew Runnable                               Override                             public void run                                  new GetDataTask.execute                                                                               Thread.sleep1000                      catch InterruptedException e                          e.printStackTrace                         break                                                                      gettingdatathread.start           private class GetDataTask extends AsyncTaskltString, Integer, Doublegt           Override         protected Double doInBackgroundString... params               getData              return null                   protected void onPostExecuteDouble result              if line.isEmpty ampamp linenullampampconnectioncode.length gt 6                    tvLapTime.setTextMyVar   myvar                                 public void getData              if connectioncode.length gt 6                  try                      ListltNameValuePairgt nameValuePairs  new ArrayListltNameValuePairgt                     nameValuePairs.addnew BasicNameValuePairconnectioncode,                             connectioncode                     httppost.setEntitynew UrlEncodedFormEntitynameValuePairs                      response  httpclient.executehttppost                     entity  response.getEntity                     is  entity.getContent                     line  convertInputStreamToStringis                     response.getEntity.consumeContent                  catch ClientProtocolException e1                      e1.printStackTrace                  catch IOException e1                      e1.printStackTrace                                                   convert inputstream to String         private static String convertInputStreamToStringInputStream inputStream                 throws IOException              BufferedReader bufferedReader  new BufferedReader                     new InputStreamReaderinputStream             String result               while line  bufferedReader.readLine  null                 result  line         try              json  new JSONObjectresult          catch JSONException e1              e1.printStackTrace                   if json  null              try                   myvar  json.getStringconnectioncode  myvar              catch JSONException e                  e.printStackTrace                               inputStream.close         return result      codepre

Negative 889 pIve run into a weird occurrence with regards to my child activitys lifecycle methods. If I launch and close the activity enough times, there eventually comes a point where for some reason, upon launching, codeonPausecode gets called immediately after codeonCreatecode skipping codeonResumecode, which is then followed by codeonResumecode being called twice in a row. This ends up causing a codeRuntimeExceptioncode in my codeonResumecode.p  pHeres the code that starts my activityp  precodeIntent intent  new IntentMainActivity.this, RecorderActivity.class startActivityForResultintent, AVCAPTURE codepre  pMy onPausep  precodeprotected void onPause      camera.stopPreview     camera.setPreviewCallbacknull     camera.release     camera  null     super.onPause  codepre  pIm not really sure what else I can provide here, its all pretty straightforward. codefinishcode is called to close the activity, etc.p  pI should also probably mention that the activity is being triggered from a Javascript Interface attached to a WebView. Another interesting thing to mention is that setting a breakpoint anywhere in the first code block above seems to prevent the issue from happening.p
Negative 889 pWe have a set of HTML blocks  say around 50 of them  which are iteratively parsed and have codeAudiocode objects dynamically addedp  precodevar SomeAudioWrapper  functionname     this.internalplayer  new Audio    this.internalplayer.src  this.determineSrcFromNamename       ultimately an MP3    this.play  function      if someOtherConditionsAreMet        this.internalplayer.play           codepre  pSuppose we generate about 40 to 80 of these on page load, but always the same set for a particular configuration. In all browsers tested, this basic strategy appears to work. The audio load and play successfully.p  pIn IEs 9 and 10, a transient bug surfaces. On occasion, calling code.playcode on the inner codeAudiocode object fails. Upon inspection, the inner codeAudiocode object has a code.error.codecode of code4code a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryieff97474228vvs.8529.aspxMEDIAERRSRCNOTSUPPORTEDa. The files code.durationcode shows codeNaNcode.p  pHowever, this only happens occasionally, and to some random subset of the audio files. E.g., emusuallyem codefileabc.mp3code plays, but sometimes it generates the error. The network monitor shows a successful download in either case. And attempting to reload the file via the console also fails  and no requests appears in IEs network monitorp  precodevar a  new Audio a.src  thebrokenfile.mp3 a.play  fails a.error.code  4 codepre  pEven appending a query value fails to refetch the audio or trigger any network requestsp  precodevar a  new Audio a.src  thebrokenfile.mp3v12345 a.play  fails a.error.code  4 codepre  pHowever, attempting the load the broken audio file in a new tab using the same code works the unsupported src plays perfectly.p  pAre there any resource limits we could be hitting Maybe the unsupported audio finishes downloading late Are there any known bugs Workaroundsp  pI think we can pretty easily detect when a file fails. For other compatibility reasons we run a loop to check audio progress and completion stats to prevent progression through the app an assessment until the audio is complete. We could easily look for code.errorcode values  but if we find one, what do we do about itp  pstrongAddendumstrong I just found a related question  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22522493ie91011soundfilelimitIE 91011 sound file limita that suggests theres an undocumented limit of 41  not sure whether thats a limit of 41 requests for audio files, 41 inmemory audio objects, or emwhatem.

Negative 889 pI have a JTable in a JScrollPane, and the table gets new rows of data every once in a while. Eventually there are more rows of data than can be displayed at once and so the ScrollPane kicks in. I want the Scroll Pane to jump to the bottom to its maximum value every time new data is added, so I wrote this, which is called right after the new row is addedp  precodejScrollPane1.getVerticalScrollBar.setValuejScrollPane1.getVerticalScrollBar.getMaximum codepre  pIt works quite well, but there is a problem It doesnt scroll to the complete bottom. It always leaves out one row of the table that you need to manually scroll down to reach the complete bottom.p  pMy suspicion is that the new row of data is somehow added only after the method is over it is activated after pressing a JButton and activating an actionPerformed kind of method.p  pHow to fix thisp

Negative 889 pI am working with a system that uses EJB 2. The system consists of two separate applications, one is for user management and the other is the actual application containing business logic. p  pIn the business logic application I have a bean managed entity bean that represents a User.  The application reads information from the user management database, but cannot modify it.p  pWhenever a user is modified in the user management application, the business logic application is notified that the user has changed. This is implemented as a call to the business application to remove the bean, which causes Weblogic to remove it from the cache and to delete it which does nothing  see code for ejbRemove below. The next time the business application needs the user it will reload it from the database.p  pWe use the following code to invalidate a single userp  precode    try              UserHome home  UserAuthHome getHomeUser, UserHome.class          User ua  home.findByPrimaryKeyuser         ua.remove   This will remove a single cached User bean in the business logic application          catch ... codepre  pThis works fine, but sometimes epsecially when doing development strongI need to invalidate all cached User beansstrong in the business application.

Negative 889 pI have a question about styles. In my Windows Universal application I have certain buttons. These buttons have a stackpanel as a child and the stackpanel has an image as a child. The purpose of this is that the button needs to contain an image. p  pNow my employer wants to ignore the theme settings of the user. So whenever a button is clicked he doesnt want the background color of the button to change. The only way Ive found so far to do this is with a style. However when I use a style the button is displayed without its children. The style I made looks like thisp  precodeltStyle xKeyButtonstyle TargetTypeButtongt             ltSetter PropertyTemplategt                 ltSetter.Valuegt                     ltControlTemplate TargetTypeButtongt                         ltGridgt                             ltVisualStateManager.VisualStateGroupsgt                                 ltVisualStateGroup xNameCommonStatesgt                                     ltVisualState xNamePressedgt                                     ltVisualStategt                                     ltVisualState xNameDisabledgt                                     ltVisualState xNamePointerOvergt                                     ltVisualStategt                                     ltVisualState xNamePointerleavegt                                     ltVisualStategt                                 ltVisualStateGroupgt                                 ltVisualStateGroup xNameFocusStatesgt                                     ltVisualState xNameFocusedgt                                     ltVisualState xNamePointerFocusedgt                                 ltVisualStateGroupgt                             ltVisualStateManager.VisualStateGroupsgt                         ltGridgt                     ltControlTemplategt                 ltSetter.Valuegt             ltSettergt         ltStylegt codepre  pThis was a proof of concept.

Negative 889 pYesterday I posted a question on SO a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25541283howtofindaspecificvalueinmultidimensionalsessionarrayHEREa regarding a multidimensional codeSESSIONcode array I was working with to keep track of items in a shopping cart Im developing. One of the very helpful responses suggested I create the codeSESSIONcode array not as a multidimensional array, which I agree is a smoother approach.p  pThe codeSESSIONcode array is started when a user clicks any of the Add to Cart buttons on the store page. My original code with the multidimensional array is thisp  precodequantity  1   add first item from shop page ifissetPOST[additem] ampamp issetSESSION[cart]      SESSION[cart]  array     SESSION[cart][POST[productdescription]]  arrayquantity gt quantity, price gt POST[productprice]     headerLocation httpwebsite.comcart.php      codepre  pAnd this worked fine, but I was not able to achieve the results with this that I wanted see the other post.p  pThe code I was suggested to use is thisp  precodequantity  1   add first item from shop page ifissetPOST[additem] ampamp issetSESSION[cart]  SESSION[cart][]  arrayproductdescriptiongt POST[productdescription], quantity gt quantity, price gt POST[productprice] headerLocation httpwebsite.comcart.php  codepre  pAnd it works great and allows me to do what I want to do again, see the other post for details.p  pHOWEVER...p  pRegardless of which Add to Cart button is clicked on the store page there are only four, the FIRST click gets information added to the codeSESSION[cart]code array TWICE. Every other button clicked afterward is entered only once. And again, it does not matter which button is clicked first, this happens no matter what.p  pHeres the result of a codeprintrcode on the new codeSESSIONcode array codep  precodeArray      [0] gt Array                      [productdescription] gt iPhone case  Black             [quantity] gt 1             [price] gt 9.49               [1] gt Array                  [productdescription] gt iPhone case  Black         [quantity] gt 1         [price] gt 9.49        codepre  pI have scoured SO and Google for clues as to why this is happening, but no matter how I word my queries, I just cant seem to find anything that helps.p  pIt has to be something simple that I am missing...p  pSincere thanks in advancep  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pTo clarify, there are only 4 items on the store page. There wont ever be any more. To keep things super simple, each item has its own Add to Cart button. When the button is clicked, the user is taken to the cart page where they can adjust the quantity or delete the item then either check out cancel and clear the cart or continue shopping.p

Negative 889 pIm working on replacing my old code that uses threads to a .NET 4.5 Task based system.p  pIve replaced threads with Tasks, next Im working on replacing my Thread.Sleep calls with Await Task.Delay.  The problems Im having with this is that await cant be called within a Synclock section and also every method that now uses Await Task.Delay instead needs to be labeled Async.p  pI can probably get around the synclock issue as I only have a few blocks of those and can be replaced with better code.  However, having to label each method Async is causing problems.  It then means I have to label the method that calls that method Async and so on down the chain.  Eventually all my methods are going to be Async.p  pIs this how it should be done when using a Task based approach or am I doing it wrongp  pEdit 1 Posting example code p  precode  Public Async Function DelayMilliseconds As Integer, Optional Initial As Boolean  False, Optional Silent As Boolean  False, Optional Modifier As Double  0.3,                          Optional Task As Task  Nothing, Optional ExitOnTaskStop As Boolean  True As Tasks.TaskOf Boolean     Dim OutputBufferKey As String  Nothing      If Task IsNot Nothing Then       If Task.StopRequested Then Return True       OutputBufferKey  Task.OutputBufferKey     End If      If Initial Then       Milliseconds  Rand.Next0, Milliseconds     ElseIf Modifier gt 0 Then       Dim MinValue As Integer  CIntMilliseconds  1  Modifier       Dim MaxValue As Integer  CIntMilliseconds  1  Modifier       If MinValue lt MaxValue Then Milliseconds  Rand.NextMinValue, MaxValue  1     End If      If DebugMode AndAlso Not Silent Then       Dim LengthString As String  Nothing       Select Case Milliseconds         Case Is lt 60  1000  LengthString  Math.RoundMilliseconds  1000, 1 amp  seconds         Case Is lt 60  60  1000  LengthString  Math.RoundMilliseconds  60  1000, 1 amp  minutes         Case Else  LengthString  Math.RoundMilliseconds  60  60  1000, 1 amp  hours       End Select       OutputOutputBufferKey, Sleeping for  amp LengthString     End If      If ExitOnTaskStop AndAlso Task IsNot Nothing Then       Try         Await Tasks.Task.DelayMilliseconds, Task.CancellationToken.Token       Catch ex As OperationCanceledException         Return True       End Try     Else       Await Tasks.Task.DelayMilliseconds     End If      Return False   End Function codepre  pI need the delay for many reasons and that method is called in a number of other methods. To give a couple of examples I have code that uses the OpenPop DLL to check an inbox for a message to arrive, if its not there on the first check I need to wait before I check again, I have the loop and a sleep if nothing has been found.

Up to now no problem.p  pNow, It has been required that this codetimertaskcode should run until the coderXMLFileTimer.cancelcode is called strongorstrong a given amount of time.p  pMy first approach which didnt work was to implement a codeFuturecodeas followsp  precodepublic class Test   public static class MyJob implements CallableltReadFileTimergt       Override     public ReadFileTimer call throws Exception          Timer timer  new Timertest          ReadFileTimer t  new ReadFileTimer          int delay  10          Delay in seconds         timer.schedulet, 0, delay  1000          return t        public static void mainString[] args       MyJob job  new MyJob     System.out.printlnnew Date      FutureltReadFileTimergt control  Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor.submitjob      ReadFileTimer timerTask  null     try          int maxAmountOfTime  30         timerTask  control.getmaxAmountOfTime, TimeUnit.SECONDS       catch TimeoutException ex          control.canceltrue                 catch InterruptedException ex        catch ExecutionException ex         codepre  pThis is not working because I cannot call codetimerTask.cancelcode after the timeout has happen.

Negative 889 pI am developing for an embedded system, which means I have to use a linker script. Which is no big deal. I start off with the following Make rule to link everything togetherp  precodeRELEASETARGET  OFILES     LD Tlinkerscript.ld entry ResetISR gcsections LIBDIR o   LIB codepre  pAs you can see this line contains an error linkerscript.ld is a dependency of this rule, but it is not mentioned in the dependencies. But if I simply add it to the end of the depsp  precodeRELEASETARGET  OFILES linkerscript.ld     LD Tlinkerscript.ld entry ResetISR gcsections LIBDIR o   LIB codepre  pIt also gets added to the list after o and the program will fail to run on the device.p  pNeither of these warnings is harmful, but I like to live without them. It is btw not possible to simply remove the Tlinkerscript.ld part and only add the script to the list of dependencies then the configuration will not be loaded correctly and the program will fail to run on the device.p  pSo, how do I add this dependency without adding it to the list of .ofilesp
Negative 889 pI have published several git repositories in an Apache http server located in a Windows system. And the files are saved in the same computer. Now I want to move these git repositories into another   computer, where there is also an Apache http server with gitweb. Generally I use codegit clone httpusernameipaddressgitrepositorynamecode to clone these repositories into other local machines.p  pBut when I directly copied these git repositories into one git root directory, the codegit clonecode will report one error about codeinforefscode. p  pIs there any efficient ways to do this work Thank you.p  pstrongUPDATEDstrongp  pIn the Windows 7 computer, I save these repositories in codeFgitrootcode directory.

Then in other computers, we could use codegit clone httpusernamewindowsipaddressgittestcode to clone this repository to develop. Also we could use codegit pushpull origin mastercode to do those operations about git to update or modifiy the git repository.p  pNow, I want to move these repositories in codeFgitrootcode into another computer where the operating system is codeUbuntu 12.04code, and also the apache server is installed and configured with gitweb for http access like that in the Windows system. I just copy those files in codeFgitrootcode into codemediabackupdatagitrootcode the Ubuntu computer.

Negative 889 pIm having a small problem with a piece of code Im writing and was hoping someone could point me in the right direction. I have a site in a 3 column display, from left to right I have the nav bar, content, and a sidebar for news updates and such. Im trying to set the nav bar to stick to the top of the screen when the user scrolls, and this works fine.

Negative 889 pI have made andor implemented a few dozen scripts and tools that are in use by my colleagues.  Some of them are quite simple, and some of them are relatively complex.  They are written in Python, VB and AutoHotkey.  Many of them are standalone scripts, but others are extensions of Esri ArcGIS, Microsoft Access, SharePoint, Adobe Acrobat, etc...  All on Windows.  There are also a bunch of scripts and tools made by other people that I have found and used in various workflows which should be documented as well.p  pI have only been doing GIS programming for a few years and as such my incode documentation has gone from not at all to reasonable as I am having to revisit what I wrote before.  I need to begin documenting all these tools and scripts in a more complete way, not just in the code.  However Im not sure how to start.  I could write a document for each one, but I for see that becoming unmanageable.  p  pIs there a documentation control system that I could implement that could make the task easiersimpler  Especially for upkeep as tools change, adjust and are added to.  If I move to another position I dont want whoever comes behind to be left with a pile of junk because I was the only one who knew how to implement these scripts.  I also need to have something that my coworkers can refer to if Im not available when they need to reinstall various programs and my tools along with it.  p  pIt seems an overwhelming task and I need to know how to start so that Im not shooting myself in the foot later.p

Negative 889 pWell as title says, Im trying to set a column value based on the sum of two columns in the same table, I mean, I have a row on a table where I have some attributes capital,income,matexpense,otherexpense,netprofit I will be updating this row everytime I sell a new product or register some payments, when I sell a new product, I will update the income attribute adding the sale price, when I register a matexpenseraw material expense I will update that attribut adding the new expense price the same action with otherexpense, my point is I want to calculate the netprofit of my sell, If i sell 20 and I spend 10 on raw material, I want my netprofit attribute to be 10, and make the same operation everytime I update de the table, the same thing I wanna do with the capital attribute income  matexpense  otherexpense, that is basiclly what I need to do, Ive been reading this operation should be done by a trigger on sqlite, I have been reading some post but I dont get how to fit it to my case, can you guys give me a hands with this Examplep  precode capital  income  matexpense  otherexpense  netprofit      5         20         10              5             10 codepre  pBy the way, this is a consult, could be possible to make a trigger which make an attribute acts as a accumulator as I explained before, Ill be upgrading some attributes, adding new values,everytime I do that, I need to consult the currently value save it in a Variable then I sum the new value, which I think Its not much efficient.p  pThank you so much by reading and I really thank any help you guys can give me.p

So all in all i need to form single table which brings me elements with calculated date difference.p  precodeSELECT table1.name, table1.salesstage, users.username, DATEDIFFNOW, table1edit.dateedited as DaysOnStage FROM table1 join users on table1.assigneduserid  users.id join table1edit on table1.id  table1edit.parentid WHERE table1.salesstage  table1edit.aftervaluestring codepre  pThis one brings all edited values with correct date calculated.p  precodeSELECT table1.name, table1.salesstage, users.username, DATEDIFFNOW, table1.datecreated as DaysOnStage FROM table1 join users on table1.assigneduserid  users.id codepre  pThis one brings me all elements but if they were edited ofcourse with bad date difference. Need somehow to combine these selects and form single table. Thanks in advance p

Negative 889 pI am attempting a prototype mobile application. The requirements are an Odata delivery mechanism, and an existing SQL Database. I built a WebAPI 2.2 web service application using visual studio. I installed Entity Framework 6 and Odata V4. It was quite simple getting it nearly fully functional. I do have one issue...p  pI have a basic two SQL table backend. The Primary table has configuration elements, the secondary has daily acquired data from several systems. The secondary table has a primary key that is compound of the configid and the date descending. This allows the table to naturally sort most recent first basic schema below. p  pThe WebAPI service runs great and as expected. odataconfigs, returns all configs. odataconfigs1 returns a single entity. odataconfigs1detail returns all the appropriate detail records with most recent first... Fantastic. The one area Im having a problem with is odata uri query that is required for paging data. Top, skip, etc do not return the correct record sets... they are returning the bottom of the dataset, as if the sql primary key order has no meaning... this is curiousp  pI had read somewhere that paging may require a primary key id on the table. Is this accurate Can someone point out where to begin looking for documentation or a solution for this issue. In addition, any insight into custom datasets, stored procedure handling with odata query etc would be helpful in the near future.  p  pPrimary Table Config configid int Primary Key name varchar50 more... Secondary Table Detail configid int link to primary date datetime data varcharmaxp  pThanks in advance,p  pStew Basterashp

Negative 889 pIm trying to extract all of the English like words and phrases from an unknown file format to index in Lucene. Its basically full of random characters interspersed with blocks of English words. The goal is to be able to extract a high percentage of the words to pass to Lucene to index them  full accurate parsing or a 100  readable result is not needed. Will any of the Analysers in Lucene do the job, or are there known techniques for extracting the Englishlike text from an unknown file.p

Negative 889 pwe are attempting to use HSV color thresholding to track objects on the ground using a wireless camera mounted on our quadcopter. Wireless commands are sent through a Futaba RC controller connected to our Linux computer using a USB interface. Qt is being used to run and compile our c code. p  pThe goal is to identify that an object of a specified color is within the field of view and then commands are sent to the quadcopter which will instruct the craft to fly towards the object. Currently the geometric center of the object is found and its pixel coordinates are used to decide which way the craft should fly. In the code listed below, commands are sent even without the presence of an object on the screen. p  pWhy are commands being sent to the craft before an object is present in the field of view Why does the craft continue to respond after the object has reached the center of the screen 240 pixelsp  pMy guess is the loops are improperly structured but I have very little coding experience and would appreciate your input Thanksp  precodeint mainint argc, char argv[]        Matrix to store camera frames     Mat cameraFeed     Mat threshold,thresholdRed,thresholdBlue,thresholdGreen     Mat HSV      VideoCapture capture     capture.open0     capture.setCVCAPPROPFRAMEWIDTH,FRAMEWIDTH     capture.setCVCAPPROPFRAMEHEIGHT,FRAMEHEIGHT      Create infinite loop     bool loop  true     whileloop              capture gtgt cameraFeed         capture.readcameraFeed          Convert to HSV         cvtColorcameraFeed,HSV,COLORBGR2HSV          ADD GAUSIAN BLUR         GaussianBlurHSV,HSV,Size5,5,0,0          Object groundRobotRedgroundRobotRed          Values taken from trackbars         groundRobotRed.setHSVminScalar18, 44, 103         groundRobotRed.setHSVmaxScalar36,142,249          inRangeHSV,groundRobotRed.getHSVmin,groundRobotRed.getHSVmax,thresholdRed         morphOpsthresholdRed         trackFilteredObjectgroundRobotRed,thresholdRed,HSV,cameraFeed              Quadcopter Systems Check             if flying  0                              stdcoutltlthelloltltstdendl                 testcontrol.conn                 testtestcontrol.isConnected                 coutltlttestltlttestltltendl                 if test                     testing                 else                     loop  false                         If object is located on the top of the screen          ifgroundRobotRed.getYPosltlt240                    Pitch forward command          testcontrol.transmit570, 565, 500, 500, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0          stdcoutltltPitch Completeltltstdendl                    else                      Hover command            testcontrol.transmit570,565,500,500,0,0,0,0,0                         capture.release             HSV.release             thresholdRed.release              capture.open0               imshowwindowName,cameraFeed             waitKey10                 return 0   codepre

Negative 889 pIm writing a program that listens on a Serial Port. I already have code that utilizes the VCP drivers Virtual COM Port to open a serial connection and then add an event handler for any time data is received. That code roughly looks like thisp  precodepublic void OpenPortstring portNumber      port  new SerialPort         portName portNumber,         baudRate 9600,         parity Parity.None,         dataBits 8,         stopBits StopBits.One          port.DataReceived  ReadData   private void ReadDataobject sender, SerialDataReceivedEventArgs e      string data  port.ReadExisting.Trim     Console.WriteLineReceived   data  codepre  pThis works great.

I have most of the equivalent code that I need written, with the notable exception of being able to read data whenever a data received event occurs.p  pThe D2XX driver includes one method for setting up event handlers whenever data is received, called codeSetEventNotificationcode. Heres what the method signature looks likep  precodeSetEventNotificationUInt32 eventMask, EventWaitHandle eventHandle codepre  pThe first parameter is straightforward enough they have some predefined uints you can pass in to determine when the event should trigger, but Ive never worked directly with EventWaitHandles before, and I found a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryyfk7eby4vvs.110.aspx relnofollowthe documentationa difficult to grasp, so Im having trouble getting started.p  pAt the end of the day... I would like to have an event listener method which performs a read task, and which I can assign using the codecode operator, as I did above with the VCP driver.p  pBased on what I was reading, it looks like Ill have to create a new codeThreadcode that essentially polls continuously for the EventWaitHandles signal Or something like that Any examples or sample code to get me started or finished would be appreciated.p  pHeres what I have so farp  precodepublic void OpenPortstring portNumber      port  new FTDI     var status  port.OpenBySerialNumberportNumber     if FTDI.FTSTATUS.FTOK  status throw new Exception      status  port.SetBaudRateUInt32 9600     if FTDI.FTSTATUS.FTOK  status throw new Exception      status  port.SetDataCharacteristics         DataBits FTDI.FTDATABITS.FTBITS8,         StopBits FTDI.FTSTOPBITS.FTSTOPBITS1,         Parity FTDI.FTPARITY.FTPARITYNONE          if FTDI.FTSTATUS.FTOK  status throw new Exception      var evHandle  new EventWaitHandlefalse, EventResetMode.AutoReset,      port.SetEventNotificationFTDI.FTEVENTS.FTEVENTRXCHAR, evHandle       ... now what   public void ReadDataobject sender, EventArgs e      UInt32 bytesAvailable  0     port.GetRxBytesAvailableref bytesAvailable      string data     UInt32 bytesRead  0     port.Readout data, bytesAvailable, ref bytesRead      data  data.Trim     Console.WriteLineReceived   data  codepre

I want support for those advanced instructions as well.p  pThe Goal is to finally have something likep  precodepublic int myJavaMethodlong value      doSomeJavaStuff...      int result  0     asm             push eax,                      mov eax, value,                      cmp eax, 0,                      jne notEqual,                      mov result, 1,                      jmp done,         notEqual    mov result, 0,         done        pop eax      doSomeMoreJavaStuff     return result  codepre  pWhat I havep  ul liThe Intel manual for their OPCodes and the Architecture VOL2li liI officially can compile and run a asmnop program part by now using JNAli ul  pCurrent challengesp  pDue to the nature of the task I will try and gain access to the underlying JavaVM stack frames  which is possible remember you get the esp stack pointer and the base pointer ebp even with the addresses the ret op will place in the eip pointer but couples the solution with a certain java VM  build target, which I do not have a problem with since one can create various target adapters and poking around in the JavaVM implementations will be fun and interesting.p  pA problem with the above string based solution would be the handling of parameters and results. It might be necessary to provide a parameter mapping like asmparamsresult, value, whatever, opcodes and place output variables either directly in the right memory slots or the registers the JIT used to fill the variables in the params call or do something like result  asmResultresult to read the actual changed value from the data section of the asm call and place it in the correct value.p  pBy using Unsafe on those information one can even access Object and Class variables and navigate those values obtaining the addresses and types of all those references used within the asm code. So using asmmov eax, super.field would be possible without interfering with Java  unless the JIT again does some interesting optimization on register caching but might be unlikely since asm... is a certain call and caching object variable content might violate the concurrency conditions regarding objects. But yet again thats a question for the JVM developers from Oracle.p  pSo if you have any information about existing Java code or C code that can help me with anything like this, you are welcome.p  pThe best help would be a Java implementation of a x86 compiler that already has ways to translate certain asm constructs in a series of bytes op codes so I might go the route of simply create a real ASM method from those above calls and the information gathered by inspecting the methods byte code along with Unsafe and whatever source of information.p  pIn the end I want to just write assembler within my Java code without going at length and compile cASM, load ship libraries for different OS and platforms. Does not make sense. Once this works one can easily generate C function calls on demand and might even possibly bypass JNA getting rid of another dependency.p  pSo if you know of code and projects or have additional information you are welcome.p  p[Update]p  pThis question does not aim at JNI  JNA. The goal is simply bypass the use of an alien compiler and load a library. The idea is simply compile into memory directly from within Java and start the method by using a pointer to it along with some additional data for parameter and value processing. p  pJust think about this workflow write CASM, compile using gcc, loadLibrary, call method by JNA into the workflow compile using Java into memory, call method by JNA. I already can do this I just want to use more op codes without creating my own compiler frontend. It is not about if this possible but about how to do it lazily.p  pBut once I demonstrated the basic feasibility I guess people will come around adding more target platforms I only target Linux and i5  Intel Xeon v3 processors.p  p[Update 2]p  pCurrently I investigate the NASM compiler as being mentioned to be a good and actively developed compiler using the Intel notation. I asked the developers already how a transparent, simple and fast no disk access for instance integration would be possible. If this works creating a similar solution for C using a popular compiler would also be possible. p  pThe idea is edit Java source in eclipse, run program done. The compilation of those snippets in a different language and the invocation and all the other fun should be completely transparent.p

Negative 889 pIve been scouring the internet for information about how to properly generate an api key that is not tied to any user but just to an application installation and havent come up with much. So either Im thinking about this the wrong way entirely or Im not asking the question correctly.p  pSo heres what Im trying to do and please let me know if Im thinking about this the wrong way.p  pIm making a PHP Rest API with a MySQL back end. I have no users to speak of but I want to secure my rest api with an apikey so that I can at least log usage and other metrics. This api will be primarily consumed by an Android app but I also want the flexibility to be consumed by any client type really. So I was thinking of creating and endpoint named generateToken that will return an apiKey that can be used to call the service. As far as apps are concerned, they will hit this generateToken endpoint during installation and then have it saved in their shared preferences store or keychain for the lifetime of the app. Is this an appropriate way to essentially setup an apikey to identify individual calls etc Am I thinking about this the wrong way Should I just institute some sort of user store although I have no real use for it other than securing the api.p

Negative 889 pSorry, Im not sure how to name this question. p  pI am busy with codeSagem SDKcode development, and I have a bit of a problem now. The way the SDK works is that you can either use one set of assemblies without a codeSagem VERIFcode dongle, of the other set with the dongle. Both these sets of assemblies [Sagem.MorphoKit, Sagem.MorphoKit.AcquisitionComponent], [Morpho.MorphoAcquisition, Morpho.MorphoSmart] use codeC Dllscode to communicate with the actual biometric device. The thing that they didnt do though is use the same ones. So the codeMORPHOSDK.dllcode for the one is different from the other.p  pIs there a way to load the assemblies from separate folders, and execute the assembly in that folder. The Assembly resolver helps me setting the path, but the moment I load the assembly it cant find the dependencies, because the files exists in the folder and not in the executing assembly folder. p  pI hope this is clear, if you need anymore information please ask. I will clarify as far as I can.p

Negative 889 pIm pretty new at C. But have experience in C, Python etc. here is my question.p  pI have a GUI which has 2 forms.  the First form asks for a serial number of the unit and the second one is where the main test occurs. p  pIn the 2nd form, there is a stage when I wait for the controller DUT to boot up so that I can get the bootup information. I got most of the code working, but here the issue.p  pI disable the Next button until the user powercycles the unit. But, even with the button disabled, the click event occurs when the user clicks the disabled button and based on the number of click he does, the SW validates the clicks and skips the next stages.p  phow can I sort this out Or, is there another better way to code thisp  phere is my code p  precode    using System using System.Collections.Generic using System.ComponentModel using System.Data using System.Drawing using System.Linq using System.Text using System.Threading.Tasks using System.Windows.Forms  namespace WIFIDMXTEST      public partial class formtest  Form              int x  0         int MAXTESTSTATES  15                                                Set the number of test states.         string RxString           testinstructions testintsructions  new testinstructions          Create a new instance of the class testinstructions          public formtest                      InitializeComponent             buttestnextClicknull, null                                    Call the buttestnextClick event             SerialINIT                   public void buttestnextClickobject sender, EventArgs e                       if x lt MAXTESTSTATES ampamp buttestnext.Enabled  true                              if x  0                                      textBox1.Text  testintsructions.checkunit                     load picture here showing unit                                  else if x  1                                      textBox1.Text  testintsructions.connectcables                     load picture here showing cables to connect                                  else if x  2                                      textBox1.Text  testintsructions.powerupunit                     load picture here showing unit powerup                                  else if x  3                                      buttestnext.Enabled  false                              Disable the Next button                      if RxString  null                                      check if the Rs232 info is empty                                              MessageBox.ShowNo DUT info available.

Negative 889 pIs there any way to wait for Phase II commit to complete in MSDTC  by a blocking call, a callbacklistenerhandler, or even by polling I cant find anything in the docs that suggest that this is possible but find it hard to believe it isnt.p  hr  pIn Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator MSDTC, commits invoked by codeITransactionCommitcode occur in two phases. The first phase is synchronous by default, i.e. codeITransactionCommitcode wont return until it succeeds or fails. After this the app know the tx will be committed or rolled back, but it hasnt yet been fully committed. In PostgreSQL this is the codePREPARE TRANSACTIONcode phase.p  pThe second phase is always asynchronous, and thats when the data is finally committed and made visible to other applications. In PostgreSQL this is the codeCOMMIT PREPAREDcode phase. codeITransactionCommitcode returns embeforeem this.p  pThat means that the application can continue to do other work while its transaction finishes committing asynchronously. This other work might fail to take account of the changes made by the prior transaction if theyre not visible yet, i.e. the app can race against its self.p  pId like to be able to wait for phase II commit to complete, but for the life of me I cant see how. Advice would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 889 pI have an OData V3 service where some of the FunctionImport elements have HTTP method set to POST, e.g.p  pltFunctionImport NameDeleteFilesetsPartsIndices mHttpMethodPOSTgtp  pThis is a valid setting for OData V3 operations. But IEdmFunctionImport interface in Microsoft.Data.Edm doesnt expose HttpMethod value. I first thought that I can use instead a property IsSideEffecting, but it looks like functions that use GET method also can be marked as sideeffecting, so its not the same thing. Then its not apparent to me how to identify which HTTP method should be used to execute an OData V3 operation if IEdmFunctionImport or other EDM interfaces doesnt expose its verb.

Website allows login and stores user info in User table. p  pQuestion  strongShould I consider using Redis cache instead of querying database to get ranked posts on every request If yes then what should be stored in to cache and what should be the logic of updating cachestrongp  pIf I end up using cache then cache should have two entries. 1. Ranked posts 1. New posts. For ranked post should backend service update cache periodically and for New posts should I invalidate cache whenever new post fetched from web p  pAlso how to deal with infinite scroll if I go with cache route Example User see posts based on ranking. User scrolls for new posts after 15 minutes. by that time ranking could have changed.p  pI would appreciate any feedbackhelpp

Negative 889 pI just started learning C this year. Currently, Im using four accelerometers to calculate human body movement for my school project. I tried to use multithread but the data outputs are unstable as such when I tried multiple times, some of the data would change. It does give correct output data sometimes. The output is saved to Microsoft Excel while printing on the screen simultaneously. However, When I tried the accelerometer separately, it seems to work just fine. The output would change only when I multithread them together. I cant seem to find what cause the output data to change periodically. I appreciate any help I could get. Pardon my grammatical mistakes for it is not my native language.

Apple said that Your app declares support for bluetoothcentral in the UIBackgroundModes key in your Info.plist, but does not provide Bluetooth Low Energy functionality. The Bluetooth Background modes are for applications that communicate to other devices using Bluetooth Low Energy and the Core Bluetooth framework.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comA2Fnr.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comA2Fnr.png altenter image description hereap
Negative 889 pI was thinking R does not use pointers nor references. However, I have faced the issue of dynamic changes into a function. Heres a MWE to make my point clearp  precodegt a  functionx 2 gt b  functionx ax gt b4 [1] 2 gt a  functionx 3 gt b4 [1] 3 codepre  pwhile I was expecting changing codeacode wont change codebcode. For example, if I dop  precodegt a  functionx 2 gt b   a gt b4 [1] 2 gt a  functionx 3 gt b4 [1] 2 codepre  pI understand in the first case no copy of codeacode is done instead R looks for a function codeacode into the GlobalEnvir each time I call codebcode while in the second one it makes a copy, is that correct  But if my function codeacode is iteratively modified while I want codebcode to use it as it was at the right moment where I defined codebcode, what is the right way to do it. For now, I have thought using a copy of codeacodep  precodegt a  functionx 2 gt aa  a gt b  functionx aax gt b4 [1] 2 gt a  functionx 3 gt b4 [1] 2 codepre  pbut this wont work if I update codeacode more than once because Ill also update codeaacode.p  pthanksp
