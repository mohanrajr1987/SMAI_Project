Positive 6957 pWhen I develop shader code on my machine I often find myself in the situation where the shader works perfectly on my machine, but on other graphic cards, drivers, operating systems, etc. it doesnt.p  pHow to achieve compatibility of shadersp  pI see a few approchesp  ul lipTest on many different systems. But which systems to choose Testing with every card on every OS and every driver is not realistic. Maybe we can assume that the vendors care for backward compatibility In this case testing with old cards and drivers might be sufficient.pli lipAsk the driver for a specific version and core profile. This helps a bit, but the drivers seem very lenient, allowing me to code things that arent in the spec.pli lipCode checkers that check the code for strict compatibility with a certain spec. There dont seen to be such tools around.pli lipDont bother and wait for bugreports from users.Yet the error messages generated by the drivers are rather poor, and the observed behaviour might be as uninsightful as a black screen.pli ul  pIm targeting WinLinuxOSX platforms.

Positive 6957 pI am rendering sprites in 3d space, where each quad is formed with two triangles. I draw GLTRIANGLES see below. Since 2 vertices are repeated in this formation, vertex shader does two times the same computation.p  precode    5    3, 4                                1, 6    2 codepre  pI wanted to optimize this by using a geometry shader to repeat the two vertices. The reason for this is that the vertex shader is expensive and there is a high number of triangles in the scene. After a lot of hackery, I managed to pull it off. It turned off to be very inefficient. It is actually 45 slower on my machine. I assume that this comes from the fact that primitive assembly is performed two times and a lot unnecessary data copying happens in the geometry shader. I cant view the assembly code so I can only guess. p  pNow to my question, is there a better way of doing this that would actually be faster than doing all the extra vertex shader operations.p
Positive 6957 pTo use bindless images in OpenGL, you need to create a GLuint64 handle using emglGetImageHandleARBem. You can then set this handle to a uniform image2D variable and use the image as if you had bound it the old way. No problems with that. With texturessamplers, it is further possible to set the texture handle not to a sampler2D, but to a plain uniform uint64t variable. This handle can then be used to construct a sampler object at runtime with the constructor emsampler2Dhandleem.p  pa hrefhttpswww.opengl.orgregistryspecsARBbindlesstexture.txt relnofollowThe extension description saysap  blockquote   pSamplers are represented using 64bit integer handles, and may be   converted to and from 64bit integers using constructors.p blockquote  pandp  blockquote   pImages are represented using 64bit integer handles, and may be   converted to and from 64bit integers using constructors.p blockquote  pSo I would assume that the construction for images works the same way as it does for samplers, but this is not the case.

Am I missing something here or is this simply not implemented right now, although it should be The video driver I am using right now is Nvidias 355.82. I would be glad if someone could shed some light on whether this works with any other drivervendors card.p  pBy the way, why would I need that feature In contrast to texture handles, image handles do not identify the whole underlying data, but only one texture level. If you want to do any mipmap or otherwise hierarchical work in shaders and need to bind severalall texture levels, you could provide the handles of all levels in a buffer and then construct them at shader runtime as needed. Right now, you have to define n different uniform image2Ds for your n texture levels, which is rather tedious, especially if the image size changes.p  pAddendum The fastest way to reproduce the compile error is to just put emimage2D0luem somewhere in your shader code.p

Positive 6957 pIm in the process of optimizing my shader code for rendering large triangle strips. It has been suggested to me that I should try to use low precision datatypes for my vertex attributes where possible so I started experimenting. I reduced some components from highp to lowp, but didnt get any serious performance improvements. So I used glGetShaderPrecisionFormat to get the ranges and precisions of the formats, however I received the same values for highp, mediump and lowp, that means for examplep  precodeint rangehigh[2], precisionhigh glGetShaderPrecisionFormatGLVERTEXSHADER, GLHIGHFLOAT, rangehigh, ampprecisionhigh  int rangemedium[2], precisionmedium glGetShaderPrecisionFormatGLVERTEXSHADER, GLMEDIUMFLOAT, rangemedium, ampprecisionmedium  int rangelow[2], precisionlow glGetShaderPrecisionFormatGLVERTEXSHADER, GLLOWFLOAT, rangelow, ampprecisionlow codepre  pthat rangehighrangemediumrangelow all have the same values as well as precisionhigh, precisionmedium and precisionlow.p  pDoes this mean that using a mediump or a lowp in place of a highp will not be faster at allp  pRegardsp

figured out that using atomicMin and atomicMax the way I have is some how causing the program to crash and not respond when calling glLinkProgram. I have figured this out by rewriting the shader slowly and testing. This has shown me for sure that atomicMin and atomicMax are the issue while atomicAdd seems to work fine. When I comment out min  and max the program links fine. What is causing this to happen Is it something I have done or is it a problem with driversp
Positive 6957 pI am trying to do an earth simulation in OpenGL with GLSL shaders, and so far its been going decent. Although I am stuck with a slightly small problem. Right now I have 3 spheres, one for ground level earth, one for clouds and the third for the atmosphere scattering effects. The earth sphere handles with most of the textures. p  pThe cloud sphere is a slightly bigger sphere than the earth sphere, and is mapped with a cloud texture and normal mapped using one created with the photoshop plugin. One more thing to point out is, the rotation speed of the cloud sphere is slightly greater than the rotation speed of the earth sphere.p  pThis is where things get confusing for me. I am trying to cast the shadow of the clouds onto the ground earth sphere by passing the cloud texture into the earth spheres shader and subtracting the clouds color from earths color. But since the rotation speeds of the two spheres are different, I figured if I multiplied the rotation matrix of the cloud sphere with the uv coordinates for the cloud texture, that should solve the problem. But sadly, the shadows and the clouds do not seem to rotate in sync. I was hoping if anyone can help me figure out the math to make the shadows and the cloud rotate in sync with each other, no matter how different the rotation speeds of the two sphere are.p  pHere is my fragment shader for the earth where Im calculating the clouds shadowp  precodeversion 400 core  uniform sampler2D day uniform sampler2D bumpMap uniform sampler2D night uniform sampler2D specMap uniform sampler2D clouds  uniform mat4 cloudRotation   in vec3 vPos  in vec3 lightVec in vec3 eyeVec in vec3 halfVec  in vec2 texCoord  out vec4 fragcolor  void main       vec3 normal  2.0  texturebumpMap, texCoord.rgb  1.0     normal.z  1  normal.x  normal.x  normal.y  normal.y     normal  normalize  normal       vec4 spec  vec41.0, 0.941, 0.898, 1.0     vec4 specMapColor  texture2DspecMap, texCoord      vec3 L  lightVec     vec3 N  normal     vec3 Emissive  normalizevPos     vec3 R  reflectL, N     float dotProd  maxdotR, Emissive, 0.0     vec4 specColor  spec  powdotProd,6.0  0.5     float diffuse  maxdotN, L, 0.0      vec2  cloudTexCoord            vec2cloudRotation  vec4texCoord, 0.0, 1.0      vec3 cloudcolor               texture2D clouds, cloudTexCoord.rgb     vec3 daycolor                 texture2D day, texCoord .rgb  diffuse  specColor.rgb  specMapColor.g  cloudcolor  0.25  1  cloudcolor.r  cloudcolor.r  diffuse     vec3 nightcolor               texture2D night, texCoord .rgb  0.5  1  cloudcolor.r  0.5      vec3 color  daycolor     ifdotN, L lt 0.1         color  mixnightcolor, daycolor, diffuse  0.1  5.0     fragcolor  vec4color, 1.0  codepre  pHeres a a hrefhttpi.imgur.comOYrcQjI.gifv relnofollowsample outputa as a result of the above shader.

Positive 6957 pIm not sure that my question is clear enough so here the explanations  Im working on a voxel engine using opengl, its working fine but I want to improve it a bit with some optimisations. I started to use VBO for the vertices of the cube, I earn some fps so thats great. But now I want to do the same thiong with the color of the cube and I didnt find an answer that please me because I have specifics needed p  ul lipI only use 3 float for the color, so even if it works glVertexAttribPointer doesnt seems to be a good way to go because if I use it Ill need to use 108 float per cube against 3.pli lipI want to draw MANY cubes so use glUniform3f isnt good neither because send 3 float per cubes would be really slow with many cubes to draw.pli ul  pSo with the context my question is, is there a way to store values in the memory of the GPU like a VBO and when I draw the cube I would only tell to the shader where are those values p  pThanks for reading, and may be answering p
Positive 6957 pTo learn opengl, Im creating a simple 3D graphics engine using openGL 3.3.  Ive recently added light attenuation over distance this has turned all objects completely black.  This was done by adding the following code to my light calculations in the fragment shaderp  precodefloat distance  lengthlite.position  FragPos float attenuation  1.0flite.constant  lite.linear  distance  lite.quadratic  distance  distance ambient  attenuation diffuse  attenuation specular  attenuation  result  ambient  diffuse  specular codepre  pIt seems safe to assume that codeattenuationcode is very small, effectively or actually 0, or negative black.  To test this I use coderesult  vec3attenuationcode, the result of this is white objects this then indicates that codeattenuationcode is not near 0 and instead 1.0 or larger an additional test trying coderesult  vec3attenuation500000code still produces white, which indicates that attenuation is quite large, perhaps infinite.  I did some infinity and NaN checks on it.  NaN checks told me it is a number, infinity checks tell me it is sometimes infinite and sometimes isnt.  In fact it told me that it is both infinite and not infinite at the same time.  I determined this by using the following code segmentp  precodeifisinfattenuation   result  vec31.0, 0.0, 0.0  ifisinfattenuation ampamp isinfattenuation   result  vec30.0, 1.0, 0.0  ifisinfattenuation   result  vec30.0, 0.0, 1.0  codepre  pMy objects turned purplemagenta.  Were codeattenuationcode infinite, I would expect my objects to appear red were they not infinite, I would expect them to appear blue were they somehow both infinite and not infinite I would expect them to appear green.  If I make the coderesult  ...code to be coderesult  ...code, the objects appear red.  In this case, were it both infinite and not infinite, as my purple objects suggest, coderesultcode would first be set to red, and then set to blue, resulting in blue objects if somehow the green check fails.p  pI hope this describes the source of my confusion.  My testing shows that codeattenuationcode is infinite, and that it is not infinite, AND that it is neither.p  pTo top everything off when I usep  precodefloat attenuation  1.0f1.0  0.0014  distance  0.000007 distance  distance codepre  pto determine the attenuation factor, everything works exactly as expected however the values shown here as constants are exactly whats passed in from my openGL calls cp  precodeglUniform1flightConstantLoc,  1.0f glUniform1flightLinearLoc,    0.0014f glUniform1flightQuadraticLoc, 0.000007f codepre  pFrom there I should conclude that my data is not being delivered to my shaders correctly, however Im confident my codelite.constantcode etc values have been set correctly, and that codedistancecode is a reasonable value.  When I single each one out as a color, the objects do turn that color.i.e. using thisp  precoderesult  vec3lite.constant, 0.0, 0.0 codepre  pmy objects turn some shade of red, for codelite.constantcode, codelite.linearcode etc.p  pSearching google and stack overflow for things like glsl isinf true and false or glsl variable is and isnt infinite gives me absolutely no relevant results.p  pI get the feeling Im distinctly ignorant of something happening here, or the way something works.  And so I turn to you, am I missing something obvious, doing this all wrong, or is this a true mysteryp

Positive 6957 pI am porting a small OpenGL framework from 3.3 to 4.3. I have shader mixmatch implemented in software ie shaders are bound individually and programs are linked lazily when a draw call is issued..p  pOpenGL 4.1 added this feature with separable programs amp pipelines however the point of having programs encapsulating all the shader stages was to be able to optimize them as a whole and only once.p  pSo I would like to know if using SPOs is slower than standard shader programs on Direct3D 11 hardware. Especially  do current implementations allow you to have one program per shader so a pipeline with 25 separate programs without significant performance loss p
Positive 6957 pIve written an a ray tracer that is supposed to diffusely shade a sphere on a canvas. When I run the code I have in the browser, Im only seeing a square appear as the sphere is supposed to be formed from 4 vertices and not the sphere within it. I commented out the function call for the function that is supposed to determine the color of the sphere and nothing changes. I have no idea what the problem is as the function that calculates the quadratic formula seems to be working properly.

Positive 6957 pIve written a fragment shader that uses simple ray tracing to render a sphere inside of a fragment shader that diffusely shades the shape. I can get this to work for one sphere however, when I try to make multiple spheres, only one can be seen. In the main function of the shader, I basically am doing the same process I did to render the one sphere for each additional sphere that I want to make, but this doesnt seem to be working currently. p  h3Additional Infoh3  pThe vertex of the sphere x,y,z,r are found by using the vertex positions for x and y i.e. codefloat x  vPosition.xcode                                    and codefloat y  vPosition.ycode. The vertex position for z is computed using the codecomputeZcode function found in the code below. Lastly, for sphere.r, I used the rays origin vertex V  the rays direction W. The rays themselves are shooting from an origin point into the screen and determining the color of of sphere based on whether or not it has hit the sphere I have the code for the functionality that does this in coderaySpherecode.p  pI think I just need  to make an array in main to store the spheres and then to make a for loop to call the coderaySpherecode and codeshadeSpherecode functions for each sphere in the array this is what I tried originally but it didnt work. p  pIn main, after initializing the one spheres vertex positions and the V and W for the ray, I have an if statement that checks if z is greater than 0 meaning that the shader is currently inside of the sphere so it can proceed with the shading, and otherwise do nothing. Since defining the bounds of the sphere this way, I wasnt sure how to have this same logic apply for multiple spheres using the for loop solution I mentioned previously. Also in main, I check to see whether the t values for each sphere is less than 10000 and if so, call the codeshadeSpherecode function to shade the sphere however, my current logic also isnt working for multiple spheres. The turbulence and fractal functions are just to add procedural texturing and they are long so I wont add the code for them.p  pWhat is the correct way to make multiple spheres I have the relevant code belowp  precodefloat computeZvec2 xy, float r        float zz  r  r  xy.x  xy.x  xy.y  xy.y.5       if zz lt 0.          return 1.       else          return sqrtzz      float raySpherevec3 V, vec3 W, vec4 sph          float b  2.0  dotV  sph.xyz, W         float c  dotV, V  sph.w  sph.w         float d  b  b  4.0  c         return d lt 0.0  10000.  b  sqrtd  2.0     vec3 shadeSpherevec3 point, vec4 sphere, vec3 material, float s        vec3 color  vec31.,2.,4.       vec3 N  point  sphere.xyz  sphere.w       float diffuse  maxdotLdir, N, 0.0       vec3 ambient  material5.0       color  ambient  Lrgb  s diffuse   max0.0, dotN , Ldir       return color     void mainvoid        vec2 c  uCursor.xy       Lrgb  vec31.,.5,0.

Positive 6957 pIm working on a game and added a shader, which fades everythin into grayscale and then into black. The shader itself works fine, but when I start it some functions of the Spritebatch and the Sprites stop to work. Colorchanges are ignored and the Alpha of anything is always 1. These methods are usually responsible for graphical changes which work very good when the default shader is usedp  precodesprite.setColorColor.RED sprite.setAlphafloatlifeTime100f sprite.drawpBatch codepre  pThis code colors a pop up red, changes the alpha and then draws it.

Negative 6957 pIm looking at making some mobile apps in my spare time and I want to be able to put them up online for anyone to use and probably opensource. Ive worked with PyS60 a while ago and I really liked it.  p  pMy problem is, I dont want to spend any money on these apps Im not planning on making money from them in any way and for me to properly distribute PyS60 apps it looks like I need to buy an expensive publisher license, then still pay every time I want an app signed. I know I can just distribute the scripts, but that entails the end user to download the pys60 interpreter...p  pId be happy to look at other languages  platforms too. IPhone apps need a dev license and I would need a Mac to compile the code Which I dont have, Im a linux x86 user.p  pJ2ME apps seem to need to be Java Verified in order to be in OVI store. I presume not though if they are distributed by other meansp  pBasically I am looking to write apps that will work on my phone N95 and if someone else sees it, I can say just get it from www.example.commyapp and it will just work. I would also be interested in using things like the OVI store as a way of distributing it. But I dont want to be spending loads of money.p  pAnyone have any experience or knowledge on this matter Is J2ME my only optionp
Negative 6957 pI am currently trying to modify an existing GWTExt application, that is using plain text passwords in its MySql database.p  pMy plan was to use md5 hashes, as the existing passwords can be easily altered with the MySql function and I was expecting to find an easy solution for the GWTExt side as well.

Negative 6957 pSQLite is a great little database, but I am having an issue with it on Windows. It can take up to 50 seconds to perform a query on a 100MB database the first time the application is launched. Subsequent loads take 10 of that time.p  pAfter some discussions on the SQLite mailing list, I am told The bug is in Windows.  It aggressively precaches big database filesbr   reads in big chunks of the files  to make it look as if programsbr  like Outlook are better than they really are.  Unfortunately althoughbr  this speeds up some programs it makes others act jerky because theybr  have no control over how much is read when they ask for just a fewbr  bytes of file.p  pThis problem is compounded because there is no way to get progress information while all this is happening from SQLite, so my users think something is broken. I could display a dummy progress report, but that is really cheesy for a sharp tool.p  pI believe there is a way to turn the precaching off globally, but is there some way around this programmatically p

Itll be used during the 2.0 version is developed ASP.NET MVC with C.p  pAs its so different from the efault install packages, Ive made it as normal windows application, not as setup application a setup application dont let us customize so much as I need.p  pAnd here is the problem As its a windows application, I must Release it and send the compiled .EXE with the .DLLs, I must not Publish because if i do so, the published .EXE will install the installer and not my application. I need a way to verify and install the .NET Framework 3.5 like a bootstrap package prerequisite used in publishing option, but remember that Im not publishing, Im doing a Release build.p  pThanks for any helpp

The entity gets serialized into a string, and deserialized into a strongnewstrong entity. Its no longer a detached entity, but rather a transient one that just happens to have the same ID as the persistent one and updated fields. If I use this entity to update, it will wipe out the relationship to codeBcode and codeDcode because they dont exist in this new transient entity.p  h1Questionh1  pMy question is, how do I serialize detached entities over the web to a client, receive them back, and save them, while preserving any relationships that I didnt explicitly change I know about codeISession.SaveOrUpdateCopycode and codeISession.Mergecode they seem to do the same thing, but this will still wipe out the relationships if I dont explicitly set them. I could copy the fields from the transient entity to the persistent entity one by one, but this doesnt work too well when it comes to relationships and Id have to handle version comparisons manually.p

Negative 6957 pI am cleaning up some code in a C app that I wrote and really trying to focus on best practices and coding style. As such, I am running my assembly through FXCop and trying to research each message it gives me to decide what should and shouldnt be changed. What I am currently focusing on are locale settings. For instance, the two errors that I have currently are that I should be specifying the IFormatProvider parameter for Convert.ToStringint, and setting the Dataset and Datatable locale. This is something that Ive never done, and never put much thought into. Ive always just left that overload out.p  pThe current app that I am working on is an internal app for a small company that will very likely never need to run in another country. As such, it is my opinion that I do not need to set these at all. On the other hand, doing so would not be such a big deal, but it seems like it is unneccessary and could hinder readability to a degree.p  pI understand that Microsofts contention is to use it if its there, period. Well, Im technically supposed to call Dispose on every object that implements IDisposable, but I dont bother doing that with Datasets and Datatables. I wonder what the practice in regards to globalization and localization on smallscale internal apps is in the wild.p

Negative 6957 pI have to code for a operating system on which I can run a calculater.It is like a desktop calculater. For this I am reading the a hrefhttpwww.brokenthorn.comResourcesOSDevIndex.html relnofollowbrokenthorn operating development seriesa I have completed the a hrefhttpwww.brokenthorn.comResourcesOSDev6.html relnofollowsecond stage of bootloadera The bootloader is in real mode. After this the author is explaining the protected mode. I dont want to use the protected mode. I dont have time for that. So I want to write the calculater in real mode by using bios interrupts. Is it possible I think it can be written on the second stage of the bootloaderI am not sure. Means I dont have to use a kernelI am not sure. I dont know how to use BIOS interrupts to handle the keyboard. Can anybody provide me a link which will help me in this And If anything wrong in whatevet I assumed above is wrong, please correct me.Thanks in advance.p

Here is the explantion of my problem quoted from the bottom of the page in the link above p  pemstrongI got a problem.... i fixed the access denied error , however that windows cannot find the file specified error is really confusing, i tested it in a normal command line , type frenchy.txt displays the content of the text file that i created, set p varname.txt displays the error. however after that, i typed echo name and it displayed the content of the text file. so the problem lies with the use or misuse of the set p command with a variable.emstrong p  pIf you need more information i highly suggest that you follow the link to my previous questions. I started a new question because no one responded to it in the comment probably because it was a totally different problem and therefore deserved a separate question. Also, the suggested solution in which i marked as the best answer with the green check mark no longer works for me because of the error windows cannot find the file specified that keeps coming up...

Negative 6957 pIm currently writing an iOS app that uses a UIWebView for surfing around pages. Sometimes I need to dynamically remove elements in the UIWebView using codestringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromStringcode, but this locks up the main UI for sometimes up to 2 seconds on my first gen iPod touch, and maybe half a second on an iPhone 3GS. The JavaScript Im using to remove it by is simplyp  precodeelement.parentNode.removeChildelement codepre  pNothing more complicated than that. At the same time Im doing some very basic 2D rendering in OpenGL ES, and if rerendering the UIWebView wouldnt lock up I would use just simple CoreAnimation on the main thread. Could it be that it has to recalculate the DOM tree, all element positions etc Should this really lock up the main UI thread Is it that Im calling codestringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromStringcode that locks up everything Is this normal and to be expected on this kind of hardware The odd thing is it is able to render some semicomplex MooTools animations in the webview, with opacity and height changes, but removing one single element takes several seconds. p  pDoes anyone have any ideas in improvements Maybe just hiding elements using codevisibility hiddencode is better, or setting codeopacity 0code  Any thoughs or wise words of experiencep

Therefore, I need to know how to store the data directly to the DB.p

The idea is that when the user clicks a certain section of the map for this example, the panhandle, the div is toggled to a div which is the panhandle image. I determine where the user clicks by knowing the pixel location of the mouse when it clicks.p  pThe problem is, pixel values are different for different size screens. Ive been told that in order to scale my calculations for where the user clicks based on their screen size, I need to p  blockquote   pscale every value before you compare it. Multiply every x by your canonical width and divide by the actual width and do the same with y and height.p blockquote  pIm confused by multiply every x by your canonical width and divide by the actual width.

I have the following codep  precode container.clickfunctione              var x  event.pageX         var y  event.pageY           Variables for area of pan handle          These variables do not seem to work yet          var xScale1  0.031x         var xScale2  0.357x          ifx  xScale1  x lessthan xScale2                   alertYou clicked the panhandle                     codepre  pThis should popup an alert when I click within the horizontal confinements of the panhandle, but nothing is happening.

Another thought would be to reverse the ids or perform some sort of scrambling. This would work fine for all the links within the site and all id have to do would be to strip off the first and last 3 digits off the product ids or descramble before using in the queries but what can I do when it comes to displaying product images I dont want visitors to be able to see the filenames, that would completely blow the cover for a ll product ids.p  pSuggestions and ideas are very welcome.p

Negative 6957 pI read through Python 3.2 changes and understand that it has made many improvement over 3.1. However, my exact same code with zero modification running on 3.2 is more than 10 times slower than when I run my code on 3.1.3p  pIt took Python 3.2 six minutes to transfer binary content of a file to a physical device then receive and prints out the received data on screen, when the exact same scenario on same PC only takes 30 second to execute with Python 3.1.3.p  pI developed my code from scratch with Python 3.1.2 and 20 of my code uses ctypes to perform transaction through windows driver with USBPCI device, so I dont think this performance hit has anything to do with backward compatibility.

Negative 6957 pAfter going through a beginners iPhone developer book and reading sample code online, Ive noticed that most Objective C programmers synthesize nearly every instance variable. Some variables are convenient to snythesize, but most should not when honoring the object oriented principle of encapsulation. The worst are synthetized properties marked as private. A C programmer trying to use someone elses code will read the public fields and methods in the header file. They will skip the private variables. This C programmer will not know that you intended the private properties to be used in some meaningful way.p  pTake a look at this sample template on a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiossamplecodeLazyTableImagesIntroductionIntro.htmllazy table image loadinga provided by Apple p  pstrongHeaderstrongp  precodeinterface ParseOperation  NSOperation ltNSXMLParserDelegategt   private     id ltParseOperationDelegategt delegate     NSData          dataToParse     NSMutableArray  workingArray     AppRecord       workingEntry     NSMutableString workingPropertyString     NSArray         elementsToParse     BOOL            storingCharacterData  codepre  pstrongSourcestrongp  precodeinterface ParseOperation  property nonatomic, assign id ltParseOperationDelegategt delegate property nonatomic, retain NSData dataToParse property nonatomic, retain NSMutableArray workingArray property nonatomic, retain AppRecord workingEntry property nonatomic, retain NSMutableString workingPropertyString property nonatomic, retain NSArray elementsToParse property nonatomic, assign BOOL storingCharacterData end  implementation ParseOperation synthesize delegate, dataToParse, workingArray, workingEntry, workingPropertyString, elementsToParse, storingCharacterData codepre  pNow I know this is not C and we shouldnt assume all C practices should be honored in Objective C.

So none of the other ivars should have setters and getters.li liWhy are very sensitive ivars synthesized For one, now that codeid delegatecode has a setter, the user of this object can switch the delegate in middle of the XML parsing, something that doesnt make sense. Also, codeNSData dataToParsecode is raw XML data retrieved from the network. Now that it has a setter, the user of this object can corrupt the data.li liWhats the point of marking everything codeprivatecode in the header Since all ivars are are synthesized to have getterssetters, they are effectively public.

If I removed the div containing the list, the same thing happens with the next div header displays correct, but the images are pushed below the first div. Have a look at the site a hrefhttpwww.greenhomesofmaine.com relnofollowhttpwww.greenhomesofmaine.coma scroll down to the footer.

Hence it is prevented from being garbage collected. Is this the reason why weak event listeners are prescribed Is the flash player so naive that, it cannot figure out that the event listener is defined within the same objectp

Negative 6957 pI know a fair amount about how Kerberos Authentication works, but for the life of me I cant explain a strange behavior I am seeing with an IIShosted WCF service.p  pIve set up an extremely simple WCF app that exposes an endpoint using BasicHttpBinding with TransportCredentialOnly. My understanding is that for Kerberos to work, a User Principal Name or Service Principal Name must be specified by the client. For some reason it doesnt seem consistent across different binding types.p  pWhen I omit this principal name, on IIS6, NTLM ends up being used. On IIS7, it uses Kerberos.  When I specify a User Principal Name on IIS6, Kerberos is used but on IIS7 the calls fail Wireshark shows an KRBAPERRBADMATCH error during the Kerberos handshake. p  pIt gets even more fun when I switch the binding to WSHttpBinding with Message security. In that experiment if I dont specify the User Principal Name on IIS6 the call fails, and on IIS7 NTLM gets used. When I specify the UPN, IIS6 fails and II7 ends up using Kerberos. Heres a summary of my findings. If anyone out there can help me wrap my mind around whats happening, Id be eternally grateful.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKtf4v.jpg altSummary tablep

Negative 6957 pIm wondering how can I achieve horizontal or vertical snapping the mouse cursor to a line. For example, on the Facebook timeline feature, when you hover the mouse over the line down the center, it snaps the cursor to the center. Bringing the mouse close to the line snaps it too.p  pId like to wrap this inside of a single custom control, rather than controls of a form. There will be either a vertical or horizontal line, and it must snap the mouse cursor to it when it gets anywhere close. I will be adding events which return the position of the line which was clicked. This control will also have a scrollbar, either vertical or horizontal, parallel to this line, and both scrollbars will never show at the same time. Theres a master property whether to display this line emverticalem or emhorizontalem.p  pThe mouse should not actually move position, but just the display of the cursor should somehow be tweaked to emshowem it in the center of this line, while the actual X or Y position never changes. I dont want to emmoveem the cursor, I want to emdisplayem the cursor in the center of this line if it gets anywhere close. While the cursor is in this snapped position, it will display another custom cursor instead of the standard or default arrow.p  pAll I need to know is how to handle, within this control, the event of a mouse pointer coming in the vicinity of this line and tweak the display of the cursor to be in the center of this line.p

Negative 6957 pIm the newly appointed techguy at a small company.  Ive inherited their nearcomplete ASP.NET web page thats been left nearcomplete for some time, but Im not really familiar with ASP.NET.  It was dropped by the original developers a few years ago, and a year or so back someone tried to finish it using only inline code.p  pNow that Ive unearthed the old VB source files, Ive made a oneline change to the codePage.aspx.vcodeb and need get it associated to its codePage.aspxcode file.  Trouble is, the codePagecode directive directly inherits its own codeAppWebPage.xxxxxx.dllcode.  Every page does this.  This is not reflected in the source I have to work with, but is the way it now operates.  The last person to touch it has long since forgotten the details of his work, and Im not familiar enough with ASP.NET to know what to ask.p  pSo my Page directive goes like sop  precodelt page languagevb autoeventwireupfalse  inheritsPage,        AppWebpage.aspx.cdcab7d2 masterpagefileMaster.Master        enablesessionstateTrue  enableEventValidationfalse gt codepre  pWhen I try to precompile the site, my Page directives look totally differentp  precodelt page languagevb autoeventwireupfalse CodebehindPage.aspx.vb        inheritsProject.Page masterpagefileMaster.Master        enablesessionstateTrue  enableEventValidationfalse gt codepre  pAnd, being precompiled, It doesnt yield a pageunique .dll file I can just swap into the live bin directory and change the codePagecode directive for.  Ive tried a number of permutations on the Page directive to try to get it to compile the new VB code on access, but I always wind up with errors, the best of which tell me ASP elements in the .aspx arent defined in the .aspx.vb.p  pCan someone point me in the right direction with thisp

Negative 6957 pWhen I destroy an object made of several bodies connected by joints, my application crashes without an error. Of course I did some research and found that this happens when one destroys bodies while the physics engine calculates a step. So I just add the bodies to a list and destroy them in onUpdate, but that didnt help. The funny thing is that destroying simple bodies works like a charm even outside onUpdate and never ever caused a crash.p  pThere was no error output, just once I managed to catch one saying that the problem is a NullPointerException in World.java on line 507. Surprisingly, there I found the followingp  precodepublic boolean isLocked              return jniIsLocked addr       codepre  pCould someone tell me what could be going on I even went so far as to destroy the bodies one at a timep  precodeif destroyList.isEmpty     Body b  destroyList.get0     destroyList.remove0     mPhysicsWorld.destroyBodyb  codepre  pThe problem persists though.p  pNotes The object I am destroying is made of several bodies connected by WeldJoints to one central body.

Negative 6957 pI have read from the book emCocoa Design Patternsem that the decorator pattern is used in many codeCocoacode classes, including codeNSAttributedStringcode which does not inherit from codeNSStringcode. I a hrefhttpwww.koders.comobjectivecfid6E9728FBD2B4BDFC1619FCCB27155000FDBEED8A.aspxlooked at an implementation codeNSAttributedString.mcodea and it was over my head, but I would be interested to know if anyone on SO has successfully implemented this pattern AND they are willing to share.p  pThe requirements are adapted from a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFile3aDecoratorUMLclassdiagram.svgthis decorator pattern referencea and since there are no abstract classes in ObjectiveC, the codeComponentcode and codeDecoratorcode should be suitably similar enough to abstract classes and serve their original purpose i.e. I dont think they can be protocols, because you have to be able to do code[super operation]code.p  pI would be really thrilled to see some of your implementations of decorator.p

Negative 6957 pIve just installed Eclipse, after i installed the java JDK. The Getting Started guide in Eclipse says i should reference my JDK installation in WindowPreferencesJavaInstalled strongJREsstrong, but that a JRE would also work.p  blockquote   pSelect the Java  Installed JREs preference page to display the installed Java Runtime Environments. Confirm that a JRE has been detected. By default, the JRE used to run the workbench will be used to build and run Java programs. It should appear with a checkmark in the list of installed JREs. We recommend that you use a Java SDK instead of a JRE. An SDK is designed for development and contains the source code for the Java library, easing debugging.p blockquote  pThere was already a JRE set up there not a JDK, so i did nothing and tried to compile a Hello World just to see what would happen.

Negative 6957 pYesterday, I posted about a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11662573confusedaboutjavascriptprototypalinheritancewithconstructorsprototypal inheritance and constructorsa. I finally settled on an approach that keeps the code nice and tidy and leaves the prototype alone at the cost of possibly minor performance impactp  precodefunction Cardvalue       setValue is a public instance method     this.setValue  function val          if range[val]              val  drawRandom                    value is a public instance variable         this.value  val          return val           this.setValuevalue  codepre  pMy problem with this approach, however, is that I have to call the setValue method whenever I want to set the value of a Card instance to get the validation. What Id like to do instead is have a custom setter method. Heres what I have so farp  precodefunction Cardval       value is a private instance variable     var value       This is a private instance method      Its also selfinvoking, but thats beside the point     function x          if range[x]              x  drawRandom                   value  x     val      this.defineGettervalue, function           return value            Some code duplication     this.defineSettervalue, function x          if range[x]              return false                   value  x          return x       codepre  pThis works well. Calling codevar card  new Cardcode gives me an instance with a random value, and calling codecard.value  nullcode fails because its out of range.p  pMy problem with this, other than the fact that it is obviously much longer, is it seems like Im duplicating some of the code. It would be nice if the setter method was called along with the constructor. That way, I could eliminate the whole selfinvoking private instance method.p

This new Session contains exactly one attribute the key is org.apache.cayenne.remote.service.HttpRemoteService.ServerSession and the value is who guessed it the session created before in step 1 What makes me wonder is that my serveltListener dont gets triggerd though a new session gets created. p  p3.Client executes line 4 from abovep  precodeListltObjectgt someEntities  context.performQueryallMovies codepre  pat the serverside now the getServerSession method is called again. This time also a new session gets created why. And this session does not contain any attribute. So the line return ServerSession httpSession.getAttributeSESSIONATTRIBUTE inside the method getServerSession returns null and exactly this triggers the exception No Session associated with request.p  pSo why is the cayenne serverside creating e ne session and doesnt use the old one created befor Do i have to explicitly send the session within the queryp  pEdit I made screenshots from the netbeans httpmonitor while running the four lines of code from above img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyTs3M.jpg althttp monitor tomcat cayennep

Negative 6957 pI have a question related to C dynamic libraries. Usually the C dynamic library is composed of a .lib file and a .dll file. If I understand well, the .lib file records the exported functions positions while the .dll contains the implementation. I know that the release version has some optimization, and hence the release dll and the debug dll should be different. Then whats the main difference between release lib file and debug lib file Is there a way to tell a lib or dll file is a release version or a debug version What would happen if a release version program invokes a debug version library Thanksp
Negative 6957 pI have a BaseEntity abstract class which is a super class for all my entities. This is a MappedSuperClass. Now I want to define a named query preferably on the baseentity such that it returns me the count of a specific sub class entity.

Is it possible with JPA 1.0 and hibernate as the implementer I want to avoid putting a named query on each of my entities other than the base entity to return the count Thanks, vp

Negative 6957 pI have an ASP.NET MVC 4 application targeting .NET 4.5. One of our child actions makes a call out to a web service using HttpClient. p  pSince were blocking on IO waiting for the HttpClient response, it makes a great deal of sense to convert the code to the asyncawait pattern. However, when MVC 4 attempts to execute the child action, we get the following error messagep  blockquote   pHttpServerUtility.Execute blocked while waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete.p blockquote  pAt first glance, it appears as though MVC 4 does not support asyncawait within a child action. The only remaining option is to run using synchronous code and force a Wait on the async task.p  pAs we all know, touching .Result or .Wait on an async task in an ASP.NET context will cause an immediate deadlock. My async logic is wrapped in a class library, so I cant use the await blah.ConfigureAwaitfalse trick. Remember, tagging async on the child action and using await causes an error, and that prevents me from configuring the await.p  pIm painted into a corner at this point. Is there emanyem way to consume async methods in an MVC 4 child action Seems like a flat out bug with no workarounds.p

Up to now I do it like this in the setter of the codeSelectedAgeGroupcode propertyp  precodevalue.WeightGroups  from age in ctx.AgeGroups                       where age.Id  value.Id                       select age.WeightGroups.Single codepre  pHowever, this seems a bit clumsy. First of all, because a new list is set instead of filling the existing one. Furthermore, there are some behaviours, which are unwanted. This includes e.g. the followingp  ul liIf a codeWeightGroupcode is modified and codeSaveChangescode is called, the old group is still there and additionally a new one with the modified values.li liIf the user removes an entity with codeSelectedAgeGroup.WeightGroups.Remove...code and codeSaveChangescode, the deleted rows are still there.li ul  pI assume, the reload of weight groups as listed above is causing this.p  pHow would correct Lazy Loading look like in this case Ideally, the necessary codeWeightGroupscode are loaded automatically by the framework. I read about using an codeIQueryablecode instead of codeBindingListcode for the codeWeightGroupscode property. But this interface does not have methods for inserting and removing entities. Furthermore, if I just exchange the types, not even the codeAgeGroupscode are loaded at all.p

But there is a 2 MB segment  that is not loaded. I see this 2 MB segment for every single shared library.  My process loads a lot of shared libraries. That explains the huge difference  between VSS amp RSS.

I want to list all of the codeObjectcodes for a given codeOwnercode, grouped by codeGroupcode. For example, if we were to view the groups for some Owner codeOwner Acode the table view might look like thisp  precodeGroup A   Object A   Object B   Object C Group B   Object A   Object D Group C Group D   Object C   Object E codepre  pIts also important that the Groups be ordered by their codenamecode attribute not shown in the schema above and that codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode delegate methods get called whenever Objects are modified or addedremoved from a Group. p  pGiven those requirements, I have set up the codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode to fetch a bunch of codeObjectcodes with a predicate like code[NSPredicate predicateWithFormatANY groups.owner  , someOwner]code, which throws an codeNSInvalidArgumentExceptioncode exception tomany key not allowed here. I have tried a few other predicates, but am stuck.p  pAny suggestions Is this not something I should be using an codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode for Or is there a better way to model my datap  pThanksp  pstrongEditstrong I actually got the predicate working with the above code, my mistake was in my codesectionNameKeyPathcode argument. I was trying to pass in codegroups.namecode, which was what was producing the error. I can see why that way wouldnt work, but am struggling to find a different way to achieve the desired results. Perhaps a join objectp  pstrongEdit 2strong This works somewhat well with a join object like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comO4NHL.png altmodel with join objectp  pThere are two downsides that I see now. The first is that I have to enforce uniqueness myself using code. Thats easy enough, but a bit of a nuisance. The second downside, that I dont yet see a way around, is that the codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode will not call its delegate for updates to codeObjectscode anymore. I can live with that downside for now, but am happy to hear better suggestions.p

Negative 6957 pIm trying to write a failsafe program that uses the canvas to draw very large images 60 MB is probably the upper range, while 10 MB is the lower range. I have discovered long ago that calling the canvass synchronous function codetoDataURLcode usually causes the page to crash in the browser, so I have adapted the program to use the codetoBlobcode method using a filler for crossbrowser compatibility. My question is this How long do Blob URLs using the codeURL.createObjectURLblobcode method lastp  pI would like to know if theres a way to cache the Blob URL that will allow it to last beyond the browser session in case somebody wants to render part of the image at one point, close the browser, and come back and finish it later by reading the Blob URL into the canvas again and resuming from the point at which it left off.

No code example is needed in your answer unless it involves a different solution, all I need is a yes or no on if its possible to make a Blob URL last beyond sessions using this method or otherwise.

Negative 6957 pWhat would be a good heuristic to use to solve the following challengep  blockquote   pQuality Blimps Inc. is looking to expand their sales to other cities   N, so they hired you as a salesman to fly to other cities to sell   blimps. Blimps can be expensive to travel with, so you will need to   determine how many blimps to take along with you on each trip and when   to return to headquarters to get more. Quality Blimps has an unlimited   supply of blimps.p      pYou will be able to sell only one blimp in each city you visit, but   you do not need to visit every city, since some have expensive travel   costs. Each city has an initial price that blimps sell for, but this   goes down by a certain percentage as more blimps are sold and the   novelty wears off. Find a good route that will maximize profits.p blockquote  pa hrefhttpswww.hackerrank.comcodesprint4challengestbsphttpswww.hackerrank.comcodesprint4challengestbspap  pThis challenge is similar to the standard Travelling Salesman Problem, but with some extra twists The salesman needs to track both his own travel costs and the blimps. Each city has different prices which blimps sell for, but these prices go down over his journey. What would be a fast algorithm i.e. n log n  to use to maximize profit p  pThe prices of transporting the items in a way makes the TSP simpler. If the salesman is in city A and wants to go to B, he can compare The costs of going directly to B vs. costs of going back to Headquarters first to pick up more blimps. I.e. is it cheaper to take an extra blimp to B via A or to go back inbetween. This check will create a series of looped trips, which the salesman could then go through in order of highest revenue. But what would be a good way to determine these loops in the first place p
Negative 6957 pI have a stand alone Java process that is reading messages off of a JMS durable topic and submitting them to threadpool for processing. I am doing it this way for obvious concurrency reasons, but maintain the order of processing of those messages, I am still submitting them to a single thread pool. Now here are my concerns relating to JVM crash..p  pNon Transactionalbr  I am NOT reading and processing every message in a Transactional context, which I avoided as it slows down my process. So, I am accumulating messages in the blocking queue of the threadpool. But if JVM crashes while say 10 messages are in the threadpool waiting to be processed, I will lose that data. p  pTransactionalbr I believe if I read and process each message in a transaction, if something goes wrong that message will be redelivered to the process when it comes backup.p  pSince it is a common problem to many people working in lowlatency systems, wondering how experienced people approach this problem Thanks.p

Negative 6957 pI am having trouble determining the best way to do this. We are maintaining a complex DB which the average business analyst will have a lot of trouble dealing with. Another developer created a couple of stored procedures as reports which we had been exporting for the users on demand into excel spreadsheets.p  pThe client requested that these results be exported into an access database.p  pIf this were 2 or 3 columns, I would just create a template accdb file and shove the results of the stored procedure in there.

Negative 6957 pI am using two popular tools the Zurb foundation and the Supersized jquery plugin for a site. I have used them together once before. However, when I use them together Zurb Foundation CSS squeezes the image aspect ratio which distorts the images in the Supersized jquery plugin. It does this when the browser window is made narrow. p  pThat was ok in my previous site. It will not do in my current site. p  pSo what is happening is the images are getting squeezed when the window or device is narrow. p  pIf I remove the Zurb CSS then Supersized keeps the aspect ratio intact so I know that the cause has something to do with the image resizing that Zurb Foundation does. So how do I over ride the Zurb CSS for just the background images in Supersized.p  pSite demo can be seen here a hrefhttpmwildmandesign.comIBGindex.html relnofollowhttpmwildmandesign.comIBGindex.htmla p  phere is a site the resizes a bit and keeps the aspect ratio intact the way I need it to look on my site a hrefhttprisd.edu relnofollowhttprisd.edua p

Negative 6957 pI am using jsPlumb for a medium size project. Although the documentation is slim in terms of solid explanations, Ive managed to complete the project and now Im ready to deliver it. p  pRight before deliver date Ive been asked to make the connection lines straight instead of curved. I thought this would be as easy as adding a keyword to the jsPlumb connect method like codejsPlumb.connect connector Straight... code... and it is. So whats the problemp  pThis project Im working on has to allow users to select the connection lines so they can then press a Remove button to clear the connection they selected. Ive allowed users to select a connection by calling jsPlumbs codesetPaintStylecode method like sop  precode SelectDeselect each connection on click jsPlumb.bindclick, function connection, e     e.preventDefault     connection.setPaintStyle        strokeStyle red      codepre  pThis works as expected only when the lines are curved emjsPlumb defaultem. p  pHowever, if the codeconnectorcode option in the codeconnectcode method is changed to strongStraightstrong, connection lines that are vertical emtheir endpoints are across from each otherem simply disappear when I click on them. The rest of the straight lines that dont have their endpoints directly across from each other do not have this issue.p  pRemoving the connector option altogether, or setting its value to Bezier, or not calling the codesetPaintStylecode method when the option is set to Straight, then the clicked line stays in place like is supposed to do.p  pHere is a jsBin example a hrefhttpjsbin.comogekot4edit relnofollowjsPlumb setPaintStyle with Straight lines bugap  pInitially I thought this was a bug in my application, but after spending a ton of time Ive tracked the issue down to the setPaintStyle method. I feel pretty confident that this is a jsPlumb bug, but Im not totally sure. It is very frustrating at this point because the only thing that holds me back from delivering the project is the ability to change the stroke color to red. If I can complete this simple task with straight lines, then I can move forward.p  pIve considered to target the SVG path node myself and change the stroke color that way, but since jsPlumb uses VML for IE8 emie8 is a requirement for this projectem, I am not sure that I can do that. Any suggestionsp

Negative 6957 pI am developing a web app to be used during business meetings by users that can come with various OS and browser configurations.p  pThe app interface is based on CSS and the jQuery library. Since the users configurations cannot be fully known in advance, there is a need to plan for backup solutions that are easy and fast to manage in case some users, especially Windows users, happen to come to the meeting with, say, an old version of IE that will not allow the web app to run with all its features. NB  I am not so worried about Mac OS users running Safari and Windows users having Firefox or Chrome installed, given the automatic update features that these browsers have.p  pI just came across a hrefhttpportableapps.comappsinternetfirefoxportable relnofollowPortable Firefoxa and I thought that coming to the meeting with a few USB keys with Portable Firefox on them could be a good option to allow especially the old IEs users to join in, without having to go through the hassle and the risks associated with a browser installation at the beginning of the session.p  pDo you confirm  Would there be anything more to do to ensure that CSS3, javascript and jQuery will be available to these Portable Firefox users or can I be sure they will be by default p  pCheers.p

Negative 6957 pI have a GridView of layouts which can be dynamically added or removed to the grid.p  pIn iOS, the native behavior for GridView items is for the other items in the grid to slide into the place of the removed item, or slide to make room when a new item is added.p  pHowever on Android the behavior is just for the changes to instantly pop in on the screen. I tried adding custom animations to each getView call using some tricks in the GridViews adapter, but that ended up causing some problems seen herep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15845527androidgridviewloadingthe0indexediteminalaterindexsslotwhendataseAndroid GridView loading the 0 indexed item in a later index39s slot when data set changesap  pI tried having the individual views control the animation instead of the getView method of the adapter, but the end result was identical.p  pI also tried using a GridLayoutAnimationController, like thisp  precodeAnimation animation  AnimationUtils.loadAnimationmActivity, R.anim.griditemfadein GridLayoutAnimationController controller  new GridLayoutAnimationControlleranimation, .2f, .2f mGrid.setLayoutAnimationcontroller codepre  pThis works on the initial load of all GridView content, but any changes to that content just instantly pop in like it does by default.p  pI feel like this is a pretty simple feature, and there should be an easier way to do it. The best Ive seen from searching online is a hrefhttpsgithub.commrKlarPagedDragDropGrida librarya which animates GridView items that swap places in the grid, but that isnt what Im looking for in that same library, when you remove an item from the Grid via deletion the same instant effect that Im trying to avoid occurs.p  pA common answer on SO Ive also seen is Look at the APIDemos, there are tons of examples. But as far as I can see, there are actually no examples for animating GridView content changes.p  pAny help is appreciated, thanks.p

Negative 6957 pI am doing convolutions with a large amount of small images  3636 or so  and small filters  33 to 55 . So a FFTbased solution is not what I am looking for. Perhaps a highly optimized and tuned implementation  with SSEAVX, multithreading  is better for me.p  pHowever, convolution is not included in BLAS. And FFT libraries  FFTW  do not have a convolution function. I tried scipy.signal.convolve2d, and it is even slower than my naive C implementation.p  pIs there a dedicated convolution library optimized for small kernels on CPU It will be better if it automatically switches to FFT on large kernels. I am coding in Python, but CC library is OK as long as I can import it with ctypes.

Negative 6957 pI want to write a UPnP control point application for Android using the CyberGarage CyberLink for Java API. To test the API I implemented a very simple application. In this application a UPnP control point actively searches for any UPnP root devices, listens for responses and device notifications, and prints a list of the devices, which are available on the network.p  pThe app runs on an Android phone, but none of the UPnP devices on my network are found. I tried this on two different Android phones. To check out if this is an Android specific problem, I implemented the same functionality as a Java console application.

Negative 6957 pI know this question might have been asked, but I think this is slightly more complicated than what I found through the search function.p  pWith a PHP code, I wish to order results from a MySQL table by the number of occurrences from another table, if there are any, in a strongDESCstrong order.p  pLet me explain myself concretely.p  pI have two tablesp  pFirst table, called post with the following nonexhaustive contentp  ul liidli li...li ul  pSecond table, called postvotes with the following nonexhaustive contentp  ul liidli lipostidli liuseridli li...li ul  pIn reality if a user votes for an existing post the ones listed in the post table, a record is made in the postvotes table, inseting the post id as postid and the user id as userid. There can therefore exist from 0 to several occurrences of the post, if multiple users voted for it, and this constitutes the amount of votes for a post.p  pNow, this is how I wish to order my results. I need to order the posts listed in the post table by their votes, i.e. by their number of occurrences from the postvotes table.p  pOne thing to keep in mind though, some posts might never receive any vote, and 0 occurrence would be found in the second table, for instance.p  pI would appreciate any help on the topic Thank you in advancep

When I click the tab, it correctly displays the corresponding tab content BUT it doesnt scroll you to the start of this content.  You have to click the tab again for it to then do the scroll to the content, which isnt good.p  pSadly the reason I need is that I am using this on a mobile website, and when you click the tab, although it does actually change the content, it is bellow the tabs menu, and therefore below the visible area of the screen, hence why I want it to swap the content then scroll you down to this so you can see it, and of course with one click only.p  pSo I think I need to combine the scroll functionality within the tabs setup code... somehow... as a callback or something... but I just keep breaking it p  pAny help would be so much appreciated.p  pThanks in advance, TJp

Negative 6957 pI am writing an API using Django REST Framework and I am wondering if can specify permissions per method when using class based views.p  pa hrefhttpdjangorestframework.orgapiguidepermissions.htmlsettingthepermissionpolicyReading the documentationa I see that is quite easy to do if you are writing function based views, just using the codepermissionclassescode decorator over the function of the views you want to protect with permissions. However, I dont see a way to do the same when using CBVs with the codeAPIViewcode class, because then I specify the permissions for the full class with the codepermissionclassescode attribute, but that will be applied then to all class methods codegetcode, codepostcode, codeputcode....p  pSo, is it possible to have the API views written with CBVs and also specify different permissions for each method of a view classp

Negative 6957 pSo I am working on my first batch script that utilizes a OSQL query.

What I emwantem to happen when a deadlock is encountered is to rerun the query that failed, then continue down the list.  p  pMy thoughts were that with the errorlevel check and goto, it would do what I want.  Instead, when it jumps back up to RESTARTER, the value of G is lost and I get a permanent error loop.  p  pI have tried setting another variable to the value of G outside of restarter...and while this works, once the query is executed successfully, it drops out of the original FOR loop and stops.p  pSo, my question is, how do I tell the script to retry the last failed command and continue the FOR loop until the end of names.txt is reachedp  pEdit  Okay, so I was able to make it work by putting the actual osql command in a separate batch file, then calling that batch from the loop and passing G as a parameter.  However, Id still be interested in knowing if there is a way to do this without separate scripts.p

Negative 6957 pThis question may initially appear similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19616619matlabconstantanonymousfunctionreturnsonlyonevalueinsteadofanarraythis other questiona but my situation is a little bit different.p  pI have a function deriv that takes a symbolic expression  as its input, then takes the first derivative of that symbolic expression. That derivative is then converted into an anonymous function using codematlabFunctioncode, and is then evaluated over an array of points. I also use the anonymous function later in some other code.p  pThe problem Im having is that sometimes the input symbolic expression happens to be linear, and thus the derivative is constant therefore the anonymous function is also a constant. When I evaluate the anonymous function over the array of points, I only get one output instead of an array of outputs.p  pHeres some code showing what Im doing. For the sake of simplicity here, lets assume that the symbolic input expressions will involve only one symbolic variable called codeqcode.p  precodefunction[derivFun,derivVals]  derivinput derivSym  diffinput,q derivFun  matlabFunctionderivSym,vars,q evalPoints  [12345] in my true application, a much larger array derivVals  derivFunevalPoints end codepre  pSo if the input is codeq2code, then the output codederivValscode will be [246810]. But if the input happens to be, say, code3qcode, then codederivValscode will be 3 just a single scalar. What Id like is for codederivValscode to be [33333]. That is, Id like codederivValscode to be the same size as codeevalPointscode even if the input function happens to be linear or constant. And I dont know ahead of time what the input expression will be.p  pCan anyone give suggestions for a scheme that would do that I understand that a constant anonymous function will just return a single constant scalar, regardless of the size of its input. What Im hoping for is perhaps some way to recognize when the anonymous function is constant and then still cause codederivValscode to be the same size as codeevalPointscode.p  pI know that I could use a codeforcode loop to evaluate codederivFuncode for every row of codeevalPointscode, but Id like to avoid using such a loop if possible.p  pThank you for your time and consideration.p

I get the following error when I try to multiply this value by other valuesp  blockquote   pTypeError unsupported operand types for  float and instancep blockquote  pBelow is my usagep  pmachineframemass15. other 3d objects added to this framep  pg,c6.6e34,3.e8 constants in float formatp  pmachine.massgc this value is of typefloat, it prints, saves as any other variable, but traces back error to this statement.  p  pIt seems to only have a problem inside an object for the controls module. This statement machine.massgc does not give an error when not associated with a slider p  pSome of my research indicates that in pre3.x versions of vPython any user added attribute is an instance and built in ones are genuine objects, but in 3.x versions built in attributes are treated the same as user added ones. I have to use ver2.73 due to the software on the school computers needed for my presentation.p  pIs there any way around this error, while still using a slider object, while still using ver2.73p

When were ready for a release, I branch off of dev and merge it with the release branch. By doing so, Im getting the individual commits from dev in the release branch. I want the release branches to only have one consolidated commit for that release. p  pe.g. dev branch has these commits p  precode[1.1.0.50] Individual Commit  ...

Negative 6957 pI have a flex application that requires multiple and long http requests to get data from server. During runtime,  a random http request simply hangs. The browser network panel shows http request pending and till emexactly five minutesem. During this time, any request made from the same browser session to that hostname does not load at allpending.p  pI tried modifying the keepalive request headers but the server response seem to reset to the default value which is any way just 5 seconds.p  pI found the value of 300s in apache conf under Timeout Directive. On changing the Timeout from 300 to 30, the browserhost hangup changed to 30 seconds. Why is the browser waiting for the Timeout message after cancelling the httpRequest even in a new tabp  pI am closing the actionscript urlstream using codeustream.closecode . The urlstream is reinitialized with codeustream  new URLStreamcode. On initializing without close, the previous request goes to completion causing slower loading and high bandwidth. I fear the actionscript close is not able to give a proper closure to the http request, but it happens only some times.p

Negative 6957 pI am making a tower defense game in which I would like separate asyncTasks to handle all the unit movements, collision, damage, etc and I want the GL Thread to only handle drawing...p  pSo I have my 3 asynctasks in MyGLSurfaceView extends glSurfaceView class.p  pI handle onTouchEvents via an override in my GLSurfaceView.p  pEverything runs directly on the GL thread until it is time to run the mobs through the maze, at which I use a sequence of a Handler h posting a series of prepare methods loading the mobs for the level, and preparing various other required entities. The last step in this process is to edit the sharedpreferences which in turn triggers the 3 asyncTasks through the implementation of onSharedPreferencesChangedListenner in MyGLSurfaceView NOT my Rendererp  pOn my older devices Nexus S and an older Samsung galaxy tab, this always works perfectly. On my Galaxy S4, it only works about 8090 of the time. When it doesnt work, various alternate results can occur   The app remains responsive, and keeps drawing everything that is required on screen, minus anything that was changed by the asynctasks strangely, using Log, I noticed that the asynctasks also seem to be running properly, showing expected values in the log monsters are moving properly, over the proper path, while towers are correctly firing missiles at them, and these missiles are behaving as expected causing damage and potentially causing mob death on impact. Visually, I see a clump of mobs on the start waypoint, my towers, my game area, my UI which remains totally clickable and interative with 0 lag. Just nothing is moving. I noticed, when this behavior is observed, that if I press the home key to trigger onPause, and then return to the app, triggering onResume, the action resumes normally, from the beginning as if all the previous Log posts from my asynctasks were lost. This is what usually happens when the app fails. What could be causing this Are my asyncTasks sometimes working on a separate instantiation of my renderer Why does it always work on older devices but not always on the new devicep  ul liThe app crashes, due to a null pointer on my array of mobs maybe things are executing out of orderli ul  pShould I be avoiding asynctask when using openGL esp  pShould I even be doing this updating mob locations via doInBackground and simply drawing the objects with their latest coordinates as determined in the asynctaskp

Negative 6957 pThis might seem like a weird question to ask, but is there a convention on how to order arguments in a constructor, and especially where to add arguments the constructor gains in subclasses It seems to me there should be one, after I found myself reading code like this Code is Groovy, but thats not really relvent to the questionp  precodeclass Matter      double volume     double mass      Matter double m, double v          mass  m volume  v        class Food extends Matter      double nutrition      Food double m, double v, double n          super m,v nutrition  n        class Apple extends Food      double sweetness      Apple double s, double m, double v, double n          super m,v,n sweetness  s         class GreenApple extends Apple      double acidity      GreenApple double a, double m, double n, double s, double v          super s,m,v,n acidity  a       codepre  pAs Ive illustrated above, once we have arrived at GreenApple, any order that might have once been there in the constructor arguments is gone. Note, however, that the programmers did not add their new arguments randomly  the author of Food believed that new arguments should be added in the back, the author of Apple believed that they should be added at the front, and the programmer of GreenApple thought the arguments should be sorted alphabetically, but together, they made the constructors fairly messy and type safety will be of no use here, these are all doubles.p  pCoincidentally well, not really, these are also the three conventions I though there might be. So, my question is now, is there a such a convention, and if there is, what is it And does it differ between languagesp

Negative 6957 pI am attempting to connect to a DB on Cloudant. I created the DB from a JSON and uploaded it to Cloudant here a hrefhttpsdeanradar.cloudant.comtempdata80d7d28d9e96778ad3bf4531817ab190 relnofollowDeanRadarap  pI copied the info byte for byte into another JSON on my server including the id and rev. If I call the JSON directly it works fine, but I can not get the code to work when I enter the URL given above.p  pI am guessing the URL is just a place holder and it gets resolved before returning it to my browser, like it is supposed to have a .json on the end of it or something that the browser can read but not the code. I do not know enough about Cloudant, Couch, angular, etc to know what I am looking for. I have done plenty of PHPSQL databases but this is my first attempt with cloudantjasonangular.p  pHere is the code in question ignore the fact that I declare dbURL twice, it is there to show what I have usedp  precodevar dbURL  httpsdeanradar.cloudant.comtempdata80d7d28d9e96778ad3bf4531817ab190 var dbURL  datatempData.json                 http.getdbURL.successfunctiondata                      tempDataDeferred.resolvedata                  codepre  pThis works, when I access the JSON on my server copied from the cloudant DB, but swapping the dbURL lines accessing the direct URL for the cloudant DB returns nothing.

Negative 6957 pIve created a basic server using Java servlets. What Id like to do is implement a more liberal URI syntax by allowing nonalphanumeric characters in the URIs as long as they are hex encoded i.e two words.txt could be encoded as twowords.txt.p  pIm not sure how to go about this. Ive tried using javas .replace in the form of uri.replace ,  but this gives me a message format exception.p  pIf anyone could help that would be great. Cheers.p

Negative 6957 pI am using sprite kit and I have an SKLabelNode that I set up in my initWithSize method.  It is declared as..p  precodeproperty nonatomic, strong SKLabelNode chargesToShowUponCompletion codepre  pIn the initWithSize method I create it this way..p  precodechargesToShowUponCompletion  [SKLabelNode labelNodeWithFontNamedChalkduster] chargesToShowUponCompletion.fontSize  40 chargesToShowUponCompletion.fontColor  [SKColor whiteColor] chargesToShowUponCompletion.position  CGPointMakeself.size.width2, 1.53.0  self.size.height chargesToShowUponCompletion.zPosition  20 [self addChildchargesToShowUponCompletion] [chargesToShowUponCompletion setHiddenYES] codepre  pAs you can see, I hide the LabelNode right after I have added it to the scene.  I actually have several that I create like this, and I reveal them a different times.  This one in particular needs to be shown for a bit, then disappear.  So to accomplish that I have used the following.p  precode[chargesToShowUponCompletion performSelectorselectorsetHidden withObjectYES afterDelay3] codepre  pThis works perfectly in iPhone 5, iPhone 4, and the simulator.  However, when I run it on a 64 bit machine, or simulator, it does not work.  It actually works as if I had setHidden withObjectNO.  I am figuring it has something to do with the 64 vs 32 bit iPhones, but I can not figure it out.  I read Apples doc about supporting both and I have my Architectures set for Standard.  Is there some way I can get this selector to run on both types of machines  Also, the other LabelNodes that I create are hidden and shown at various times, they all work, but none of them deals with the selector.  Any ideas Thanks for the helpp

Negative 6957 pI am facing a problem regarding horizontal submenu that needs to push down body content. But I am not getting it. I have tried out few things with different css. And I want to be done using CSS since it would be a responsive menu with 100 div. So I cant give any pixel width in sub ul. I have almost done it but main menu got push down when I hover on it. I know there might be a solution for this using CSS code and it would be great if someone can help me out on this. And if its cant be done with CSS then I would like to know if there is any jquery solution for it or not. Here I am sharing my CSS along with HTML.p  pThere are 3 menus in the given css and html and also you can see it in jsfiddle link as well that Menu 1 and Menu 2 submenu along with Body Content got push down but Menu 3 is working fine. I want to fix the Menu 1 and Menu 2 just like the Menu 3. p  pAny help would be appreciated.p  pThanks, Royp  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodeltdiv idmenugt      ltul idnavgt     ltligtlta hrefgtMenu 1ltagt     ltulgt     ltligtlta hrefgtfdesfcltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtdrgdrgltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtdgvdvgltagtltligt     ltulgt     ltligt      ltligtlta hrefgtMenu 2ltagt     ltulgt     ltligtlta hrefgtiuoluiouoltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtabcdeltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtbhnhbnhltagtltligt     ltulgt     ltligt      ltligtlta hrefgtMenu 3ltagt     ltulgt     ltligtlta hrefgtMenu 3 Submenu item 1ltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtMenu 3 Submenu item 2ltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefgtMenu 3 Submenu item 3ltagtltligt     ltulgt     ltligt     ltulgt  ltdivgt ltdiv classcleargtltdivgt ltdiv classcontAreagtLorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

Negative 6957 pIm having some problems with a DMA interrupt handler Ive adapted for an LCD display on a MicroChip PIC32 embedded chip.p  pI have limited internal memory and need a frame buffer for my colour LCD.

Negative 6957 pIm building my first project with SpriteKit, but I cant figure out this part. p  pMy project includes enemy helicopters flying into the screen. Each enemy plays a sound file around 14 seconds long. Its not a loop. It includes the sound of the enemy approaching before it enters the screen and more sound fx while it moves across the screen. The problem is that when I kill one of this helicopters, the sound keeps playing even after the enemy helicopter node has been removed from the scene.p  pI tried using the playSoundFileNamed action but I know those cant be stopped.p  pI tried using a hrefhttpsgithub.comnicklockwoodSoundManager relnofollowSoundManagera but since all the enemies have the same file id, if I stop one, it stops all of them, even the ones still on the screen.p  pI read I should use OpenAL but I cant find a source that explains how can I add some kind of ID to each sound playing to know which one to stop. p  pSame with AVAudioPlayer. I tried creating a player for each enemy but for some reason the runBlock SKAction just ignores this code and never plays the sound. Weird. I also read AVAudioPlayer is better for playing background music than with handling sound FX.p  pIs there some kind of sound engine that helps with this issuep

Negative 6957 pI have a simple example view with two slightly different links, one with an inline confirm and one that uses JQuery to show a dialog.

The jQuery  JavaScipt event also hits the controller and Ive even traced it into the render for the result page but nothing actually renders out to the screen. p  pNow, the only thing that Im doing a little strange is the hidden field to store the url to the Result Action, but storing it like this seems to the correct thing to do to avoid issues with the URL being improperly read by JavaScript.  p  pDialog.cshtmlp  precodeusing System.Globalization      ViewBag.Title  Dialog   ltlink hrefContentbootstraptheme.css relstylesheet gt ltlink hrefContentbootstrap.css relstylesheet gt ltlink hrefContentthemesbasejqueryui.css relstylesheet gt ltscript srcScriptsjquery2.1.0.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srcScriptsjqueryui1.10.4.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srcScriptsbootstrap.jsgtltscriptgt  lth2gtDialoglth2gt  ltpgtlta hrefUrl.ActionResult onclickreturn confirmAre you really suregtClick Meltagtltpgt  ltbutton typebutton idTestLinkgtShow JQuery Dialogltbuttongt  ltinput typehidden idRouteUrl valueUrl.ActionResult gt  ltdiv iddialog titlejQuery UI in ASP.NET MVCgt     ltpgtYou now have the power of ASP.NET, the simplicity of clientside scripting with jQuery, and the looks of jQuery UI.

Negative 6957 pI have a viewpager and some images setted on click above the viewpager. The problem is that I setted the images onclick according to the viewpager position. It works fine, but the problem is that if I start the application, and click one of the images, it shows what it should show when the position is 1, but if I scroll to the 2nd image and then scroll back to the first, the position is not anymore correct, and it remains the 2nd position. How can I clear the position after each scroll to make it get the position correct Thanks p  pMainActivity.javap  precodepackage com.descoper.rom  import java.io.IOException  import

Negative 6957 pRecently I have been performing simulations on some dynamical system, where all the dynamical quantities are interdependent. To therefore simulate the dynamics I performed loops over small time steps dtltlt1 and changed the quantities within each iteration. The simulations were done in respectively Mathematica and Matlab. I got nice results but simulations could take quite long due to the slow iteration process. Generally I hear that one should avoid for loops like I have used, because they slow down the simulation greatly. On the other hand however I am clueless on how to do the simulations without iterations in small time steps. Therefore I ask you For a dynamical system, where every quantity must be changed in ultra small time steps, what are then the possible methods for for simulating the dynamics.p

Negative 6957 pI have been using CodeBlocks since I started programming in C, after trying every C compiler in existence under windows I found CodeBlocks the most easiest to work with because I wouldnt have to spend an entire year learning how to use the program before I could start writing hello world apps in it XD......p  pAnyway I installed GTK 3.0 and setup the environmental variables and ran the cmd prompt commands as the setup tutorial told me to.... I even ran the gtkdemo file from the cmd prompt....When I went to run through the CodeBlocks 13.10 gtk wizard it kept telling me that GTK seemed to be installed but that it couldnt find gtk.h after doing some digging I realized it was looking for the gtk2.0 folder and not the gtk3.0 folder...p  pSomeone on another forum seemed to have gotten past that part by changing the 2.0s to 3.0s in the wizard script but claimed it gave him more errors once he would try to compile it.p
Negative 6957 pIve been trying to optimize an angular site, and Im getting a huge amount of delay in the responsiveness of my page when switching between certain routes. Each page displayed is not massive, but it has a fair number of elements in, and a reasonable number of bindings. Ive already done what I can with bindonce, so I went and looked in the debugger with Chrome and I see most of my time appears to be spent doing GC. p  pWhats strange is there seems to be huge gaps between each GC, and Im trying to figure out what exactly those are. p  pIm guessing its when its actually removing the items and the little bars are when its doing the mark and sweep, but Im not as familiar with this level of depth of analyzing JS. Most of my work has been in CCJava.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2uaFU.png altChrome debug outputp

Negative 6957 pI have a fairly complex Ruby application that gives customers a dashboard available under their own chosen subdomain. i.e. codehttpmycompany.app.comcode, codehttpmyproject.app.comcode.p  pI also have the product website running on the root domain i.e., codehttpapp.comcode and Ive bought and configured an SSL certificate with Nginx and its working as expected, but that leaves me  with the following problem scenariop  pI need to redirect all nonhttps traffic to the https version of the page, except for any requests going to any of the subdomains.

Negative 6957 pIm developing a site that allows signedin users to create blogs posts. There needs to be an option to make it either public or password protected. Its being designed to allow users to stay on the front end of the site, which is absolutely necessary.

Any plugins, code snippets, or other items of interest I can use Thanksp

Negative 6957 pIm very new to data binding in WPF.p  pLets say I have a class called codeFileSourcecode, which has one property called codeFilecode a string and some other properties that are derived from that. In my GUI, I have a control whose appearance should change between two modes one mode if codeFilecode is codenullcode, another mode if its not codenullcode. Lets say that one mode sets the visibility of some child components to codeVisiblecode and others to codeCollapsedcode, while the other mode does the opposite.p  pI can think of 3 ways to go around thisp  ol liIn the codeFileSourcecode, create another property of type codeVisibilitycode and return the proper visibility for each control. But this to me sounds very bad  it sounds like Ill be intimately mixing the model codeFileSourcecode with the behavior of the view the control.li liCreate lots of trivial data conversion classes, then do data binding with a semantic property of the model codeFilecode, in this case. For example, a codestringcode  codeVisibilitycode converter for some of the components and another codestringcode  codeVisibilitycode converter which returns the opposite codeVisibilitycode value for the other components. This works and plays well with the property change notifications, but creating a new class for every kind of different response I expect from the subcontrols sounds needlessly complicated to me.li liWrite an codeUpdatecode method and subscribe to the codePropertyChangedcode event. This sounds to me like Ill be largely defeating the point of data binding.li ol  pWhat is the correct way to do this Is there, perhaps, a simple way to do a data conversion inline in XAML for a value I intend to read, but not write back to the sourcep

You can bind to the Icon object directly to get the images, but there is no real way of scaling these appropriately. 3. You can scale the images by using a rectangle, setting codeWidthcode and codeHeightcode and filling this with a codeVisualBrushcode, but this shars the resource among codeMenuItemscode so only one will ever show up. To get the Icons to be nonshared you have to create a static resource and set codexSharedFalsecode.

The devices also autoreboot themselves once daily.p  pId like an autoupdate solution  something where the app will update itself automatically unsupervised, say, once per day, when there is an update.

Negative 6957 pThere are basically two options to evaluate a map in Scala.p  ul liLazy evaluation computers the function that is passed as a parameter when the next value is needed. IF the function takes one hour to execute then its one hour to wait when the value is needed. e.g. codeStreamcode and codeIteratorcodeli liEager evaluation computes the function when the map is defined. It produces a new list codeVectorcode or whatever and stores the results, making the program to be busy in that time.li liWith codeFuturecode we can obtain the list codeSeqcode or whatever in a separate thread, this means that our thread doesnt block, but the results have to be stored.li ul  pSo I did something different, a hrefhttpsgithub.comtrylkssanity.commonsblobmastersrcmainjavasanitycommonsfunctionalCFMap.java relnofollowstrongplease check it herestronga.p  pThis was a while ago so I dont remember whether I tested it. The point is to have a map that applies concurrently nonblocking and kind of eagerly to a set of elements, filling a buffer the size of the number of cores in the computer, and emnot moreem. This means thatp  ol liThe invocation of the map doesnt block the current thread.li liObtaining an element doesnt block the current thread in case there was time to calculate it before and store the result in the buffer.li liInfinite lists can be handled because we only prefetch a few results about 8, depending on the number of cores.li ol  pSo this all sounds very good and you may be wondering whats the problem. The problem is that this solution is not particularly elegant IMHO. Assuming the code I shared works in Java and or Scala, to iterate over the elements in the iterable produced by the map I would only need to writep  precodenew CFMapwhateverFunction.applywhateverIterable codepre  pHowever what I would like to write is something likep  precodewhateverIterable.bmapwhateverFunction codepre  pAs it is usual in Scala the b is for buffered, or perhaps something likep  precodewhateverThing.toBuffered.mapwhateverFunction codepre  pEither of them works for me. So the question is, how can I do this in an idiomatic way in Scala Some optionsp  ul listrongMonadsstrong create a new collection Buffered so that I can use the toBuffered method that should be added to the previous ones as an implicit and implement codemapcode and everything else for this Buffered thing sounds like quite some work.li listrongImplicitsstrong create an implicit method that transforms the usual collections or the superclass of them Im not sure about which one should it be, codeIterablecode maybe to something else to which I can apply the code.bmapcode method and obtain something from it, probably an iterable.li listrongOtherstrong there are probably many options I have not considered so far. Its possible that some library does already implement this Id be actually surprised of the opposite, I cana hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25276990makingmapconcurrentimplicitlyat believe nobody thought of this before. Using something that has already been done is usually a good idea.li ul  pPlease let me know if something is unclear.p

Negative 6957 pstrongNotestrongbr Ive edited this question because I think its a general Problem when designing a userinterface. The original question was about PySide. You can see it in the history of this post.p  pp  pWhen creating a UI with a UI Designer, you often get generated code in your language.br But sometimes you have to customize this code to do things you cant do with the designer. But when you later update your design all changes will be lost when regenerating the code.  p  pSo what is the best way to customize your generated code without loosing the changes when updating the UI I thought about classing the generated class when possible and do the changes in the subclass. What do you think about thisp

Negative 6957 pOur application consists of web pages that interact with backing beans and Stateless EJB services, but there is also a remote client that interacts with the Stateless EJB services.p  pMany of the services query the DB and then filter the result set based on the current usercaller for example, users have permission to view only some record types that is, they use programmatic rather than declarative security.p  pOn the web side, my intuition would be to store the currently loggedin user in a SessionBean, but I want the Stateless EJB services to filter the result set based on the currently loggedin user so that the filtering also applies during remote client calls. I can inject a SessionBean into a Stateless EJB service, but I think SessionBeans use HTTP sessions, and as there is no HTTP session during a remote client call, I dont see how that could work.p  pI sense that my approach is wrong, and that I should be retrieving the Principal from the container however, due to our applications development lifecycle, containermanaged security is not setup yet, but I am still tasked to implement the business logic responsible for filtering records now rather than later.p  pMy closelyrelated questionsp  ol liCan a SessionScoped bean be injected into a Stateless EJB knowing that the Statelesss EJB will be invoked by remote clients What is the value of the SessionScoped bean in that caseli liInstead of a SessionScoped bean, should my backing beans and Stateless EJB services be retrieving the Principal from the container ul liIf yes, how can I substitute a mock Principal to work on the business logic until containermanaged security is setupli ulli ol  pp.s.

Im not sure how to word this because Im new to Java EE, but this remote client will not be over HTTP. Another application, lets call it application X, will receive XML messages from clients. I think they authenticate the client using certificates. Application X will transform the XML into POJOs and call my Stateless EJB services directly.p  pIn this case, I think Im right to say that I should not inject a codeSessionBeancode into a codeStatelesscode EJB service because there will be no HTTP session when the EJB service is called by Application X. Is my understanding correctp  pThank you for your patience. I am aware of my ignorance in these matters.p

Negative 6957 pI have a perl script that is continuously monitoring various directories for new files. To accomplish this, it runs forever in a codewhile1code block with a codesleepcode command at the end. Currently, I am storing identifying information in a hash that maps the directory to a unique identifier. When a new file is placed into the directory, that identifier is incremented so I can see there is a new file whenever the greatest identifier is larger than the mapped value. This works well, but now I am wondering if it would be possible to optimize my code since it will be running 247. p  pI have previously used codeFileCachecode with perl to store data in a file rather than in memory. strongWould using file caching be a better solution rather than storing the relatively small hashmap in memorystrong p

Negative 6957 pI am trying to create a masterdetail app for OSX using view controllers and storyboards.  I have two sibling view controllers codeleftcode and coderightcode with a parent split view controller. p  pThe codeleftcode child is a table vc and has an NSArrayController for its bindings.  I want the user to choose one of the table view cells, and have the coderightcode child view controller show details about the selection kind of like the Mail app interface.  p  pThe part im stuck at is how to reference the codeleftcode view controller from the coderightcode  I want to grab codeleftcodes NSArrayController, so that coderightcode can bind to the current selection.  p  pI have tried adding an Outlet to coderightcode and making the connection via Interface Builder, but it seems like IB wont let you drag connections across scenes. I then went looking for a programatic solution. I assumed NSStoryboard would have API to look up a view controller based on some id, but there isnt much API exposed.  p  pI ended up with a sloppy solution of going through the parent view controller, and searching its children to find codeleftcode in coderightcodes awakeFromNib. p  pSo is there a more elegant way to connect view controllers when using Storyboards Thanks for the help.p

Negative 6957 pIm new to automated testingJava, so please forgive me if this is a silly question.p  pMy team is considering using Sauce Labs instead of a local Grid configuration for testing our webbased applications.  I was successful at getting tests to run in parallel based on this code on Sauces website, a hrefhttpsdocs.saucelabs.comtutorialsjavarunningtestsinparallel relnofollowhttpsdocs.saucelabs.comtutorialsjavarunningtestsinparallela, but I dont like the redundancy of having to specify on each test case what browsers you want to test on.  In addition, the example code only works for desktop configurations and doesnt work for mobile devices declares OS, version, and browser only.p  pI modified the code so it now reads namevalue pairs from a text file within the Maven project and iterates through each line and sets each namevalue as a capability.  With this approach I dont have to update each of my test as new browser versionsdevices are supported by WebDriver.p  pIn researching how I might change my code to simplify my test suites, I came across the JUnit documentation that suggests this approach is creating dependencies, a hrefhttpjunit.orgfaq.htmlorganize3 relnofollowhttpjunit.orgfaq.htmlorganize3a.p  pId be interested in peoples thoughts on this approach.

Negative 6957 pI want to implement an insert function in c to build a dmax heap. The d is referring to the number of children in the heap and a max heap is a heap which has its elements structured in a priority 3,2,1.... The heap is supposed to be represented as an array and the function Im looking for is adding items from the top one by one and then continuing downward. This may seem like an easy task but Im confused about how this is going to work. p  pHere is a rough example of the template functionp  precodetemplate lttypename Comparablegt void buildHeapTopDownComparable arr[], int size, int d      for int i  0 i lt 5 i              arr[0]  2         arr[1]  3         arr[2]  4         arr[3]  6         arr[4]  9       codepre  pNow as this is some really basic code the function is not really informative about the way a dheap works. What I mean is I have not implemented the theory behind the dheap, which basically is pretty much the same as the theory behind a binary heap we only replace 2 with d in the formulas. The formulas for finding a parent and a child for a heap then becomes  codex1  dcode, codexd  1code left child and codexd  2code right child. p  pI also know there is a way to create a heap using the codeltalgorithmgtcode class, but as these functions are already prepared and they are using vectors, its not really what Im looking for. p  pExample using the algorithm classp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltarraygt include ltvectorgt include ltalgorithmgt  using namespace std  int main      int myInts[]   1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 10, 13, 15, 6, 8, 17, 9, 11, 9      vector ltintgt vmyInts, myInts  15      makeheapv.begin, v.end     cout ltlt Initial max heap  ltlt v.front ltlt endl      popheapv.begin, v.end     v.popback     cout ltlt Max heap after pop  ltlt v.front ltlt endl      v.pushback77  insert example      pushheapv.begin, v.end     cout ltlt Max heap after push  ltlt v.front ltlt endl      sortheapv.begin, v.end      cout ltlt Final sorted range      for unsigned i  0 i lt v.size i              cout ltlt   ltlt v[i]           cout ltlt endl      getchar     getchar   codepre  pAnyone who can give any hints how to do it as the way I described in the topp

Negative 6957 pIm using jQuery 2.1.3 on an Asp.net MVC site that renders partial views to certain site areas.  A partial view can contain a script block that manipulates the area DOM. Partial views can also contain other partial views, and I can thus end up with several script tags.p  pThis is usually not a problem. For simplicity I have made this example that alerts both 1 and 2p  precodebody.htmlltdiv idtargetgtltscriptgtalertdynamic dom 1ltscriptgtltdivgtltdiv idsourcegtltscriptgtalertdynamic dom 2ltscriptgtltdivgt  codepre  pBut if the first script manipulates the DOM, and moves the div containing the second script tag, emthe entire script isnt executedem, and I only get alert 1p  precodebody.htmlltdiv idtargetgtltscriptgtalertdynamic dom 1target.appendsourceltscriptgtltdivgtltdiv idsourcegtltscriptgtalertdynamic dom 2ltscriptgtltdivgt  codepre  pIm not getting any JS errors that could stop executionp  pIm using codejQuery.appendcode, that should and in fact does strongmovestrong the div element.p  pI have tried using codereadycode handlers to ensure that the DOM is fully loaded, but with the same effect.p  pThis only seems to be a problem with dynamically loaded HTML. It works if I include the code in a plain html file, but with a single page MVC site thats not a usable workaround.p  pIs this a bug in codejQuery.htmlcode or codejQuery.appendcode, or am I using it wrongp  pEDIT Im not having problems adding the script tags. Im not quite sure how added script tags are executed, and how one added script can affect the execution of the other. This could be the source of the problem. If you know how jQuery handles this, then please elaborate.p  pEDIT 2 I have recently made a big jQuery update, and this code worked with older jQuery versions. In fact, this works with jQuery1.8.3, but not with jQuery1.9.0 or later. In this update jQuery marks inserted scripts as executed to prevent them from being run several times.p  pSee a hrefhttpbugs.jquery.comticket11795 relnofollowhttpbugs.jquery.comticket11795ap  pand a hrefhttpjquery.comupgradeguide1.9loadingandrunningscriptsinsidehtmlcontent relnofollowhttpjquery.comupgradeguide1.9loadingandrunningscriptsinsidehtmlcontentap  pI know that it is poor practice to mix JS and HTML, but with MVC partial views it helps maintainability and overview to keep the JS and HTML in the same view file.p  pNevertheless, I think that jQuery somehow wrongfully marks the second script to have been executed, when in fact it has not. Can someone please explain how scripts are marked as executedp

Negative 6957 pi first installed jruby using the sudo aptget install jruby command, which succeeded but it did gave me 1.5.6 version when i wanted a later version. So i uninstalled it and used rvm install jruby command and i was able to install jruby version 1.7.19 but after installing it, my ruby applications,which were funtioning right started producing errors complaining of missing gems like mysql2 gem missing,run bundle install. i run bundle install but nothing i did seemed to help, i was getting nowhere. When i asked for the ruby version, i was receiving the jruby version instead, its lyk jruby over shadowing ruby,,,, So i decided to uninstall jruby, reinstall ruby and now ruby is functioning as well as before. Can anyone help me with the ubuntu commands which can help me install jruby alongside ruby, so that both work well without any errors Am requesting for serious help pleasep

Negative 6957 pHello I have a Java web application which has been deployed on a remote glassfish server. This server contains some libraries which may be required by the Java code. My Java code, however, also generates similar kind of libraries at compile time.

Any idea how I can figure out what libraries  my code is using Thanks in advance.p

Negative 6957 pI have a codestatuscode column in a table that I want to be an enum. Originally I created that field as an integer, thinking that I would use the built in Rails enum functionality.

Negative 6957 pHi I am working on a project. I am overriding a method in about 100 classes in the project, and I am using a map to populate some keys and values and returning the map. Now the map.put method throws 4 exceptions Null, UnsupportedOperation, IllegalArgument and ClassCast Exceptions.  So should I handle all of them or not. Obviously I should, is it all. p  pThen the question is should I handle these in every method overridden100 classes or just add throws keyword in the method and handle where I am calling these methodsp  pWhat is better practice Its a very crucial project and no exception shouldnt go unhandled, otherwise it may crash many other things.

Negative 6957 pI have an EJB timer EJB 2.1 which has bean managed transaction. p  pThe timer code calls a business method which deals with 2 resources in a single transaction.

In order to ensure consistency  across 2 resources database and queue manager, we have enabled the option to support 2 phase commit in WAS.

Negative 6957 pRecently our group has updated to Visual Studio 2013 and we have run into a problem that is driving us insane. p  pWhenever we have a .cpp file open in the editor we have problems right clicking on highlighted text. If we select text and then right click to open the context menu, the text selection is removed and any associated text options are grayed out. This happens regardless if we right click with the mouse or use the keyboard shortcut to open the menu. Copying and cutting with keyboard shortcuts still works, but as we are using Visual Assist X, all our refactoring options are useless. This behavior is only replicated in .cpp files. p  pWeve noticed similar behavior across different machines and have even removed Visual Assist X to ensure it was not the culprit. Ive searched through the Visual Studio options, but have not been able to find anything that could be causing this behavior. After finding nothing through google any help would be greatly appreciated to solve this issue.p
