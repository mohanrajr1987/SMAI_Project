Positive 9581 pI have created a fully functioning chess game with pygame in python. The only current onscreen options I have are the reset button to reset the game board and the quit button, to quit the game. I want to create an option for the user to save and load a game at any time they like, so that it will store the piece positions and whose turn it is. Ive tried using the pickle module for this, but I cant seem to grasp how it works, or whether or not it will actually work with pygame.  p

Positive 9581 pIve started using a database at work that is based off SQL and Unix. p  pI am surprised to learn, that if someone requests for a change to be made to their details at around 5PM or a certain date, then the person who is allocated the incident then has to WAIT until 5pm and make the changes manually.p  pIm surprised a button that says Apply changes later does not exist, there is only a Save button.p  pI have seen complicated solutions using Java on stackoverflow, but I am not familiar with UNIX or SQL, and googling brings no results.p  pWould it be a simple fix  It wouldnt have to account for any time differences, and Im assuming would just work off System clock and I know Java has a calendar function that I assume works off the PC clock.p

Positive 9581 pSo, the way flash works is that it requires user input in the same frame that a codefile.savecode is called, otherwise it throws an error.p  h2Problemh2  pIm using alivePDF to render out a PDF of some things on screen from my web app. It takes a few seconds to render everything, so the user is left looking at the same screen without being able to click anything, then the save dialogue pops up. I want to throw up a loading screen, just so the user is aware of whats happening. However, it wont render on screen while the PDF is being created, since the frame hasnt ended yet, so the loading screen appears just as the save dialogue is promped, so theyre left looking at the same screen still.p  h2My Temporary Solutionh2  pWhat I ended up doing was waiting for the PDF to load before prompting the save dialogue. However, as I said before, flash will throw an error without user input on that frame. So, I added a save button that prompts the dialogue. This is less than ideal, because then its like 3 clicks to save a PDF and its just less than desirable. Click the savePDF button, wait, click the save button again, then click the save dialogues save button. See my issuep  pIs there a way to delay the user input by 1 or 2 frames so flash will let me call the codesavecode dialogue automatically Or maybe force a render call midframe to show the loading screen while the PDF is getting ready, so that the user input, the loading screen, and the codesavecode dialogue are called in the same frame, but the render is called at the onset of the PDF loadingp

Positive 9581 pI am making a new game that will have about 4 worlds with 78 levels each, so about 30 levels in total. I am trying to figure out a way to save data such as highScores, unlockStatus, best time etc for each of them. p  pThe best way I have found so far is to make 1 GameData class with the NSCoding format for each world that than saves the level data. It works fine but it still seems very clunky and a lot of code as I have 4 GameData classes now and in each I still need create properties like highScores etc for each level. Lets not even talk about iCloud key value storage. p  pHow would a game like the new Angry Birds 2 save and keep track of its game data for 240 plus levels Surely they do not create 240 properties for highScores etc. p  pCould someone please steer me in the right direction.

Negative 9581 pstrongLets share Java based web application architecturesstrongp  pThere are lots of different architectures for web applications which are to be implemented using Java. The answers to this question may serve as a library of various web application designs with their pros and cons. While I realize that the answers will be subjective, lets try to be as objective as we can and motivate the pros and cons we list.p  pUse the detail level you prefer for describing your architecture. For your answer to be of any value youll at least have to describe the major technologies and ideas used in the architecture you describe. And last but not least, emwhenem should we use your architecturep  pIll start...p  phr p  h1Overview of the architectureh1  pWe use a 3tier architecture based on open standards from Sun like Java EE, Java Persistence API, Servlet and Java Server Pages.p  ul liPersistenceli liBusinessli liPresentationli ul  pThe possible communication flows between the layers are represented byp  precodePersistence ltgt Business ltgt Presentation codepre  pWhich for example means that the presentation layer never calls or performs persistence operations, it always does it through the business layer. This architecture is meant to fulfill the demands of a high availability web application.p  h2Persistenceh2  pPerforms create, read, update and delete a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCreate,read,updateanddeleteCRUDa persistence operations. In our case we are using a hrefhttpjava.sun.comjavaeetechnologiespersistence.jspJava Persistence APIa JPA and we currently use a hrefhttpwww.hibernate.orgHibernatea as our persistence provider and use a hrefhttpwww.hibernate.org397.htmlits EntityManagera.p  pThis layer is divided into multiple classes, where each class deals with a certain type of entities i.e. entities related to a shopping cart might get handled by a single persistence class and is emusedem by one and only one emmanagerem.p  pIn addition this layer also stores a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiJavaPersistenceAPIEntitiesJPA entitiesa which are things like codeAccountcode, codeShoppingCartcode etc.p  h2Businessh2  pAll logic which is tied to the web application functionality is located in this layer. This functionality could be initiating a money transfer for a customer who wants to pay for a product online using herhis credit card. It could just as well be creating a new user, deleting a user or calculating the outcome of a battle in a web based game.p  pThis layer is divided into multiple classes and each of these classes is annotated with codeStatelesscode to become a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSessionBeansStateless Session Beana SLSB. Each SLSB is called a emmanagerem and for instance a manager could be a class annotated as mentioned called codeAccountManagercode.p  pWhen codeAccountManagercode needs to perform CRUD operations it makes the appropriate calls to an instance of codeAccountManagerPersistencecode, which is a class in the persistence layer. A rough sketch of two methods in codeAccountManagercode could bep  precode... public void makeExpiredAccountsInactive      AccountManagerPersistence amp  new AccountManagerPersistence...      Calls persistence layer     ListltAccountgt expiredAccounts  amp.getAllExpiredAccounts     forAccount account  expiredAccounts          this.makeAccountInactiveaccount       public void makeAccountInactiveAccount account      AccountManagerPersistence amp  new AccountManagerPersistence...     account.deactivate     amp.storeUpdatedAccountaccount  Calls persistence layer  codepre  pWe use a hrefhttpjava.sun.comjavaee5docstutorialdocbncij.htmlcontainer manager transactionsa so we dont have to do transaction demarcation our selfs. What basically happens under the hood is we initiate a transaction when entering the SLSB method and commit it or rollback it immediately before exiting the method. Its an example of convention over configuration, but we havent had a need for anything but the default, Required, yet.p  pHere is how The Java EE 5 Tutorial from Sun explains the a hrefhttpjava.sun.comjavaee5docstutorialdocbncij.htmlRequired transaction attributea for Enterprise JavaBeans EJBsp  blockquote   pIf the client is running within a   transaction and invokes the enterprise   beans method, the method executes   within the clients transaction. If   the client is not associated with a   transaction, the container starts a   new transaction before running the   method.p      pThe Required attribute is the implicit   transaction attribute for all   enterprise bean methods running with   containermanaged transaction   demarcation. You typically do not set   the Required attribute unless you need   to override another transaction   attribute. Because transaction   attributes are declarative, you can   easily change them later.p blockquote  h2Presentationh2  pOur presentation layer is in charge of... presentation Its responsible for the user interface and shows information to the user by building HTML pages and receiving user input through GET and POST requests. We are currently using the old a hrefhttpjava.sun.comproductsservletServletas  Java Server Pages a hrefhttpjava.sun.comproductsjspJSPa combination.p  pThe layer calls methods in emmanagersem of the business layer to perform operations requested by the user and to receive information to show in the web page. Sometimes the information received from the business layer are less complex types as codeStringcodes and codeintcodeegers, and at other times a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiJavaPersistenceAPIEntitiesJPA entitiesa.p  h1Pros and cons with the architectureh1  h2Prosh2  ul liHaving everything related to a specific way of doing persistence in this layer only means we can swap from using JPA into something else, without having to rewrite anything in the business layer.li liIts easy for us to swap our presentation layer into something else, and its likely that we will if we find something better.li liLetting the EJB container manage transaction boundaries is nice.li liUsing Servlets  JPA is easy to begin with and the technologies are widely used and implemented in lots of servers.li liUsing Java EE is supposed to make it easier for us to create a high availability system with a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiLoadbalancingcomputingload balancinga and a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFailoverfail overa. Both of which we feel that we must have.li ul  h2Consh2  ul liUsing JPA you may store often used queries as named queries by using the codeNamedQuerycode annotation on the JPA entity class. If you have as much as possible related to persistence in the persistence classes, as in our architecture, this will spread out the locations where you may find queries to include the JPA entities as well. It will be harder to overview persistence operations and thus harder to maintain.li liWe have JPA entities as part of our persistence layer. But codeAccountcode and codeShoppingCartcode, arent they really business objects It is done this way as you have to touch these classes and turn them into entities which JPA knows how to handle.li liThe JPA entities, which are also our business objects, are created like Data Transfer Objects a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDataTransferObjectDTOas, also known as Value Objects VOs. This results in an a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiAnemicDomainModelanemic domain modela as the business objects have no logic of their own except accessor methods. All logic is done by our managers in the business layer, which results in a more procedural programming style. Its not good object oriented design, but maybe thats not a problem After all object orientation isnt the only programming paradigm which has delivered results.li liUsing EJB and Java EE introduces a bit of complexity. And we cant use purely Tomcat adding an EJB microcontainer isnt empurelyem Tomcat.li liThere are lots of issues with using Servlets  JPA. Use Google for more information about these issues.li liAs the transactions are closed when exiting the business layer we cant load any information from JPA entities which is configured to be loaded from the database when its needed using codefetchFetchType.LAZYcode from inside the presentation layer. It will trigger an exception. Before returning an entity containing these kinds of fields we have to be sure to call the relevant getters. Another option is to use Java Persistence Query Language a hrefhttpjava.sun.comjavaee5docstutorialdocbnbtg.htmlJPQLa and do a codeFETCH JOINcode. However both of these options are a little bit cumbersome.li ul

Every user  that uses Google for OpenID has the same url a hrefhttpswww.google.comaccountso8udhttpswww.google.comaccountso8uda.p  pHow do I support using google as an openid provider since its urls are not unique for each user Please remember the constraints that exist p  pNote Google Accounts can use any valid email address on the internet so I cant just store persongoogle.com in the openidurl field because the email could be personexample.com or worse personyahoo.com Yahoo also uses this single url method so I have to support them too.p
Negative 9581 pI know it sounds complicated to reproduce but please follow mep  pYou have a ListView with codeVirtualMode  true.codep  pSelect an item, scroll down so that the item selected gets outside the visual area and then try to add another item to the ListView.p  pYou will see that for a split second it behaves abnormally and see somekind of flicker. If you escalate the situation and try to add a lot of items really fast I add around 20 times per second you will see that the small problem becomes very big.

Negative 9581 pIm getting some weird behavior in asp.net MVC2 at least its not what Im expecting.  I have a controller httppost action that processes credit cards.  Im setting a session variable on the server to let me know if a user has attempted to process a card.  I clear that session variable when Im done.  I am doing some very quick posts to test the process and the session variable is coming back null everytime because I clear the session variable at the end of the process.  I have some debug prints that show me that the all requests are processed synchronously.  That is...the first attempt occurs, it fails, session variable is cleared, second attempt tries and fails and the variable is cleared, etc...  My first thought was that this was a side effect of debugging and that it just lined requests up for debugging purposes using the local webserver.  So I put it on a development server and the same thing is occurring.  Multiple submitsposts are processed synchronously. I even put a System.Threading.Sleep in there to make sure it would stop right after I set the session variable and it still wont even START the second request until the first is done.p  pHas anyone else seen this behavior  My understanding was that a worker process was spawned for each request and that these actions could happen asychronously.p  pHeres some psuedo codep  precodeif Session[CardCharged]  null     return RedirectToActionIndex, Problem Session[CardCharged]  false starting the process System.Threading.Thread.Sleep10000 charge card here  if providerResponse.IsApproved      System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLinefailed     Session[CardCharged]  null have to allow them to charge again since this failed     return ViewmyModel   Session[CardCharged]  true return RedirectToActionIndex, OrderComplete codepre  pI should mention that my code ALWAYS fails the credit card check for testing purposes.  Im trying to test the situation where processing is STILL occurring and redirect the user elsewhere.  I have set a dummy session variable elsewhere to assure that the session id sticks.  So I know the session id is the same for each request.p  pThanksp

Negative 9581 pIve read a few other posts like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2272714javahowtoavoidduplicatingcomplicatedcatchblocksthis onea about avoiding repetition in Java codecatchcode blocks.  Apparently, what I emreallyem want is multicatch, but seeing as Java 7 isnt here yet, is there a good pattern to let me add state to my exceptions, then rethrow them, without a hrefhttptoday.java.netpubatoday20060406exceptionhandlingantipatterns.html relnofollowcatching the kitchen sinkap  pSpecifically, I have some code that makes library calls, which can throw exceptions, but dont provide nearly enough context for successful debuging.  I find myself having a problem, then going in, wrapping the library call in a trycatch, catching the specific exception, then adding extra state information in the codecatchcode block and rethrowing the caught exception.  I then reiterate through that loop over and over, each time finding a new error condition to log.  I wind up withp  precodetry    makelibrarycall  catch SomeException e   throw new SomeException Needed local state information is   importantInfo, e  catch SomeOtherException e   throw new SomeOtherException Needed local state information is   importantInfo, e  catch YetAnotherException e   throw new YetAnotherException Needed local state information is   importantInfo, e  codepre  petc etc.  I think what Id really like to see is more along the lines ofp  precodetry    makelibcall  catchException e   e.AddSomeInformationSomehowNeeded Info  importantInfo   throw e  codepre  passuming that in that case codeecode would keep its actual runtime type when rethrown  in this case, even catching unchecked would probably be OK since Id be rethrowing them, and theyd benefit from carrying the extra state info as well.  I guess an alternate might be something likep  precodetry   makelibcall  finally    if an exception happened     logger.debugSome state info   importantInfo  codepre  pbut I dont know how to write the conditional.

Negative 9581 pDisclaimer, I am technical support and sysadmin for my company, not a developer. Im not after the specifics, simply an idea if what Id like to acheive is possible or not.p  pWe host hundreds of instances of our inhouse classic ASP legacy ecommerce software application and due to countless customisations by clients and ourselves, version management is nightmarish, custom code cant be managed and weve given up releasing new features and mass deploying bug fixes due to the inability to track who needs what patches where.p  pParellel to this question I am making management scripts to better automate this though.p  pWhat however Id really like to do is using the miniumum possible effort, port the application code not the database to a single code base. Questions I havep  ul lipCan ASP relatively effeciently handle connecting to different databases depending on the host header being called I plan some basic extension to the routine, get hostheader lookup up db credentials in metadb, set application connection string accordingly logic. pli lipThe application writes a few files to the webserver from the database for caching purposes, Id like to handle this by emulating this behaviour by writing it to something like masterappcustomer1specificfile.htm then changing the references to specificfile.htm in the code to more like masterappemshop nameemspecificfile.htm. Obviously the routines that write specificfile.htm would write to the new location accordingly. Does this seem reasonablepli lipOther webserverbound store specific contents like images and csv files I need to keep working without URLs changing ideally, can ASP employ logic to redirect get requests for imagesexample.jpg to either masterappemshop nameemimagesexample.jpg or emshopnameemimagesexample.jpg depending again on host header Or could that be done via isapirewrite which we already usepli ul  pI think these are the biggest challenges. I dont need a complete project plan of how to implement each of these things, I just want to know if its possible. If the answer is yes I should be able to sell my bosses on the development due to saving support time and our inhouse developers could hopefully manage this.p

Each of the consuming windows service is dependent on another  one service is retrieving data from one Table in Db and aggegating the data and putting  in another table in DB which would then be consumed by another service . we have the following requirements  p  ol liCould have either Push or Pull model for pushing or retrieving data tofrom DB and Services.li liThe cache must reduce the overall impact to the DB and load data by delta, rather than reloading the data completelyli liThe cache data must be updated if the source data in DB has changed.

The structure is like thisp  precodeMyApp.dll  App.cs  HelperCollection.cs  PluginBase.cs  MyPlugin.dll MyPlugin.cs this extends PluginBase Foo.cs codepre  h3The Problemh3  pMy problem is the assembly loading and locking files. A requirement of the app is that emPluginsem can be overwritten at any time. If so, they need to be reloaded. It seems the best way to load an assembly so that its not locked that is, I can overwrite it or blow away while the app is still running is thisp  precodebyte[] readAllBytes  File.ReadAllBytesMyPlugin.dll Assembly assembly  Assembly.LoadreadAllBytes codepre  pLoading the plugin assembly works just fine, no problems there. I get an exception when, from within emMyPlugin.csem, which is in the plugin assembly, I tried to use the codeHelperCollectioncode to do deserialization. An example could be something like thisp  precode HelperCollection uses XmlSerializer under the covers ListltFoogt settingCollection  HelperCollectionltFoogt.Deserializemysettings.xml codepre  pIts blowing up and throwing an codeInvalidCastExceptioncode saying that its codeUnable to cast object of type List[Foo] to List[Foo]code. After much research a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions67959netxmlserializationgotchas6907269072I finally found whya. Its getting loaded in the a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combsuzcookarchive2003052957143.aspx relnofollowLoadNeither binding contexta. p  pWhen codeFoocode is loaded from emMyPlugin.dllem its in the codeLoadNeithercode binding context while the assembly containing the type for the type conversion in my case, emMyApp.dllem is loaded in Default context. So even though they have the same name they are not considered the same type. Its doing this because Im using codeAssembly.Loadbyte[]code.p  h3Questionsh3  pHow can I get around this How can I,p  ol liLoad an assembly and not lock the file, andli liProvide the right binding context so I can cast objects which are located in the loaded assembly.li ol  pSorry for the wall of text, just wanted to get all the relevant info out there.p

Thus, it would be very dissapointing to spend much time for setting everything up and get to know that the tool lacks some crucial functionality. I address to those who have some experience with this matter and can give a piece of reasonable advice. Thank youp

Negative 9581 pThis is my first question here so please bear with me  I apologise if I have not posted correctly.p  pI have managed to pull a job description from an XML file created by our database however, the database software is very old and it converts certain  characters. p  pMy problem is as follows Bullet points are converted to something like the followingp  precode   Production of Monthly Management Accounts and variance analysisltBRgt codepre  pSo a quote mark is entered where the dot should be and a codeltBRgtcode is entered to start a new line.p  pI was wondering if anyone knows how to convert the quote mark and the codeltBRgtcode to codeltligtcode and codeltligtcode repspectively. Ive been looking at multiple options like,     codepregmatchcode and codesubstrreplacecode however, none of them have given the desired results.p  pObviously the text between the codeltligtcode and codeltligtcode would change depending on job etc.p  pTo top it all off, once this is working I need to be able to add in codeltulgtcode and codeltulgtcode around the list items, but I assume I can look for the first instance of codeltligtcode and replace with codeltulgtltligtcode and likewise the last instance of codeltligtcode and replace with codeltligtltulgtcode.p  pIm sorry for rambling on, I hope Ive made myself clear.p  pstrongEditstrong Thanks so much for all of the quick responses, I am going to give these a bash tomorrow.

It has a few options to export the data however, the XML for whatever reason kept HTML formatting so I went with that route.p  pAll of the jobs have been written in Word first and then pasted into the job field in the database, so there is a strong chance that code has been misinterpreted.p  pI did a test job and made sure I used bullet points in Word and copy  pasted it into the job field, the quote marks appeared where the dots should be, so I assume the old software doesnt understand the bullet points.p  pI will try all your great responses and report back tomorrowp  pThanksp  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pHi, below I have pasted the actual output from source view.

Negative 9581 pI have an application that is undergoing massive rework, and Ive been exploring different options  chug along as is, redo the project in a different framework or platform, etc.p  pWhen I really think about it, here are 3 major things I really dislike about javap  ol liServer startstops when modifying controllers or other classes. Dynamic languages are a huge win over Java here.li liHibernate, Lazyloading exceptions especially those that occur in asynchronous service calls or during Jackson JSON marshalling and ORM bloat in general. Hibernate, all by itself, is responsible for slow integration start up times and insanely slow application start up times.li liJava stupidity  inconsistent classloading problems when running your app inside of your IDE compared to Tomcat. Granted once you iron out these issues, you most likely wont see them again. Even still, most of these are actually caused by Hibernate since it insists on a specific Antlr version and so on.li ol  pAfter thinking about the problem... I could solve or at least improve the situation in all 3 of these areas if I just got rid of Hibernate. p  pHave any of you reworked a 50 entity java application to use mongo or couch or similar database What was the experience like Do you recommend it How long did it take you assuming you have some pretty great unitintegration tests Does the idea sound better than it really isp  pMy application would actually benefit in many areas if I could store documents. It would actually open up some very cool and interesting features for this application. However, I do like being able to create dynamic queries for complex searches... and Im told that Couch cant do those. p  pIm really green when it comes to NoSQL databases, so any advice on migrating or not migrating a big javaspring project would be really helpful. Also, if this is a good idea, what books would you recommend I pick up to get me up to speed and really make use of them for this application in the best way possiblep  pThanksp

Negative 9581 pIve been at this for at least 3 hours now  1.5  2 of which has been spent just learning regex in order to do this. I am still nowhere near comprehending it, but thats not quite the priority Id rather get this algorithm flushed out first. p  pSO..p  pHere, I have a nice little method which accepts a string which is basically supposed to contain a phrase that determines what kind of bindingflag to return. The string is evaluated by the regexpression. If this expression comes out to true, it goes onward to move through an array which lists the proper BindingFlags settings to set. I have most of this figured out  the main problem is A simplicity, and B the last two bits ensuring that a BindingFlag will be returned Which I believe I have done, but I still get a logic error from that, so obviously I havent, and comparing the string with the actual BindingFlag array to determine which flag to select and return. p  pKind of complicated for my level.

For that I have taken this qtyarray. Now  the user is allowed to change quantity. So how can I change the value of quantity in the array. as declaration of textfield is local to that loop. So at next page navigation how can i get the values of all these textfieldsp
Negative 9581 pI am now doing a project using Eclipse, and I have some resource files e.g., image, text saved in the bin folder, and these files are needed by the program.p  pHowever, with every build, Eclipse would try to clean up the folder, then rebuild the project. When cleaning, it deletes the resource files in the folder. Is there anyway to stop Eclipse from doing thisp  pI know I could change the location of the files, but I am also curious why Eclipse would do this, and could this be prevented from happening.p  pThanksp

Negative 9581 pIs there something comparable to explicit interface implementation but for classes instead in Cp  pConsider the following situationp  pCompany X provides a library containing a class as followsp  precodepublic class LibraryClass      public virtual void A        public void DoWork               does something       codepre  pCompany Y uses this library in one of its products and inherits from codeLibraryClasscodep  precodepublic class UserClass  LibraryClass      public virtual void B    codepre  pSo far everything works fine. But at someday X releases a new library version and adds a virtual method codeBcodeto codeLibraryClasscodep  precodepublic class LibraryClass      public virtual void A       public virtual void B        public void DoWork               does something          now uses B with certain semantic assumptions       codepre  pNow Y updates to the new library version. While compiling with a reference to the new version, the compiler emits a warning saying that codeUserClass.Bcode is hiding the inherited method codeLibraryClass.Bcode and therefore should either specify the codenewcode keyword or override the method. Because there is a semantic gap between the existing method codeUserClass.Bcode and the newly introduced method codeLibraryClass.Bcode Y decides to introduce the codenewcode keyword because any existing override of codeUserClass.Bcode will probably not provide the semantics expected by codeDoWorkcode which would break the code. On the other hand Y wants to use a new feature of the library which would require an override of codeLibraryClass.Bcode. Now this is not possible If the override would be done in a derived class of codeUserClasscode the override would refer to codeUserClass.Bcode due to the codenewcode keyword an override of codeBcode in codeUserClasscode itself is not even allowed as it already defines a public method with that signature.p  pThis situation could be solved if there was either a way in a derived class of codeUserClasscode to specify that the override refers to codeLibraryClass.Bcode which is not possible as far as I know or if codeBcode could be explicitly overriden in codeUserClasscodep  precodepublic class UserClass  LibraryClass      ...

CCLI supports named overrides which solve the situation, so you could do something like codevirtual void LibraryBvoid  LibraryClassBcode. The C design team probably just missed this issue.p

Negative 9581 pI noticed today that codestdvectoratcode is significantly slower than accessing values with square brackets code[]code.

Negative 9581 pI have a Form which covers the entire screen. I have a codetextboxcode on it which is normally hidden but appears when a user clicks, drags mouse and then leaves. After that user can enter any value in the text box. Once entered, ideally user should be able to click outside of textbox and then the normal service should resume.p  pBy normal service I mean that form should start getting all the events. What I have done so far is that on TextBoxs KeyDown event when Escape key is pressed, I have set the focus to the main form like thisp  precodethis.Focus where this is mainform. codepre  pBut this doesnt seem to work since codeTextboxcode still keeps receiving all the keys. I have a codeKeyDowncode event handler both for codeFormcode and codeTextboxcode and I have checked that all the codeKeyDowncode events pass on to the TextBox. I have a codeTextBoxcode Leave event Handler as well which never gets called.p  pThis codeTextBoxcode is the only control on the form and the main form is used for drawing shapes if that matters.p  pSo, how can I make this codeTextBoxcode lose focus when user clicks outside of it.p

A lot of the time I just get a random string of letters, numbers or symbols, such as 50.p  pIve found that if I echo out the result 2 times then on the final output I get the expected result perfectly.p  pMy temporary fix at the moment is, in the getCost function, to runp  precodeobstart echo cost echo cost obclean return cost codepre  pAnd so far this seems to fix the problem and I seem to get the expected result every time but its a bit weird.p  pI know its the DateTime Diff in the equation because if I replace it with the oldstylep  precodestrtotime Time2FromDatabase  strtotime Time1FromDatabase codepre  pit works perfectly every time.p  pI also have a running total costp  precodetotalCost  cost codepre  pOutputting totalCost always outputs the correct value regardless of whether I use the DateTime Diff method or the strtotime method.p  pIve also tried using intval. int and string casts on the lenInSec variable before using it in the equation and it has no effect.p  pCan anyone give any clues as to why this is happening Is it an unknown bug in PHPs DateTimeDiff classesp  pEDITp  precodedate1  new DateTime 20110904 090000, new DateTimeZoneUTC  date2  new DateTime 20110904 180000, new DateTimeZoneUTC   Essentially 1 day of work  rate  200.00 Per Day ratePerSec  0.00617283950617283950617283950617   rate  9 hours  3600 seconds   lenInSec  32400  From the diff calculation  cost  lenInSec  ratePerSec  Cost should now equal 200.   echo cost  Sometimes outputs 8, other times 200, other times 50.

Negative 9581 pIm trying to merge multiple plain text packets into one large pcap file.

Im looking to speed that up by sending multiple text files into text2pcap at once.p  pUnfortunately, from what I understand, text2pcap requires the ofsets on the text file to be correct, and since Im merging multiple different packets, Im starting over at 0000 multiple times, and I think thats causing my errors.p  pSo, assuming I have a packet that looks like thisp  precode0000 30 00 20 0010 59 23 00 codepre  pand another packet that looks like thisp  precode0000 23 50 2c 0010 a4 23 f1 codepre  pHow would I best convert the two of them into a single pcap filep

Negative 9581 pI am trying to implement a very small IP stack for 8bit AVR MCUs. I dont want it to support TCP, because its really too big and I dont need it, but rather UDP and, of course, ARP and ICMP.p  pI want the stack code to fit into 16 kiB of ROM and 1 kiB of RAM, of course letting as much space as possible for the application. I am using an ENC28J60based board for PHYMAC management, which has an internal 8 kiB RXTX circular buffer. As packets arrive into this chip, it writes them one after the other into the RX buffer but wont overwrite the oldest one. The oldest one is pointed to by a pointer which must be updated to point to the next packet when the user is done reading it. It also sends an interrupt on one of its pins when a new packet has arrived.p  pFor the RX part, I want to work just like lwIP does emsignalem that a new packet is ready when we receive an interrupt save its address and size but proceed it only when the user calls our IP stack function. This should work okay if the user does not call our function often enough, the new arriving packets will be dropped and thats it. The user provides the stack with an UDP callback.p  pNow, the problem is about TX. Lets say I want to send an UDP packet to some IP for which I dont know the link address. An ARP request has to be sent before my packet is sent. What if an UDP packet comes in before the ARP reply It has to be processed by my UDP callback, but what if I want to send something from this callback Im still waiting for an ARP reply here. For sure this blocking mechanism is not right.p  pMy question is strongis it okayaccepted to have asynchronous sendingstrong Thus if I want to send something, I provide the send function with a callback and its get called when the UDP packet may be sent. This way, everything is emeventdrivenem.p

Negative 9581 pIm looking for methods that work in practise for determining some kind of acoustical emsimilarityem between emdifferentem songs.p  pMost of the methods Ive seen so far MFCC etc. seem actually to aim at finding emidenticalem songs only i.e. fingerprinting, for music recognition not recommendation. While most recommendation systems seem to work on network data colistened songs and tags.p  pMost Mpeg7 audio descriptors also seem to be along this line. Plus, most of them are defined on the level of extract this and that level, but nobody seems to actually make any use of these features and use them for computing some song similarity. Yet even an efficient search of similar items...p  pTools such as a hrefhttpgjay.sourceforge.net relnofollowhttpgjay.sourceforge.neta and a hrefhttpimms.luminal.org relnofollowhttpimms.luminal.orga seem to use some simple spectral analysis, file system location, tags, plus user input such as the color and rating manually assigned by the user or how often the song was listened and skipped.p  pSo which audio features are reasonably fast to compute for a common music collection, and can be used to generate interesting playlists and find similar songs Ideally, Id like to feed in an existing playlist, and get out a number of songs that would match this playlist.p  pSo Im really interested in strongaccoustic similaritystrong, not so much emidentification  fingerprintingem.

On the first building they select, it works fine and places a pin on the map.  When I try and call codesetCoordinatecode on the placemark to update the position of the marker when they select a new building though, I get code[MKPlacemark setCoordinate] unrecognized selector sent to instancecodep  pIn MyViewController.h I havep  precodeproperty nonatomic, strongMKPlacemark selectedBuildingPlacemark codepre  pIn MyViewController.mp  precodesynthesize selectedBuildingPlacemark  ...  if self.selectedBuildingPlacemark  nil          self.selectedBuildingPlacemark  [[MKPlacemark alloc] initWithCoordinatemyCoord addressDictionarynil]         [mapView addAnnotationself.selectedBuildingPlacemark]          else          [self.selectedBuildingPlacemark setCoordinatemyCoord]      codepre  pI thought MKPlacemark conformed to MKAnnotation and should therefore implement codesetCoordinatecode.

Negative 9581 pI am trying to run an executable in which I have a regular CURSOR and a SCROLL CURSOR looking at a single table. The CURSOR serves to keep track of an outer loop while the SCROLL CURSOR aids in an inner loop. When I try to run the program, it seems as though the code gets stuck trying to open the SCROLL CURSOR e.g. it will print OK but not CODE DOES NOT REACH HERE. I am using SQL 2008 R2. I have tried running a very scaled back version of my code and it appears that I cannot even open a SCROLL CURSOR in any circumstance on my computer so I am wondering if it is some weird compatability isssue or I somehow have the wrong syntax even though it is straightforward.

Negative 9581 pI need to create a component on a web page to import an excel file so that the data it contains can be inserted into a table. This requires me to send the file to the server, extract the data and send the data back to be inserted into a table. Im using ASP.NET MVC3 on the server side.p  pI got the file upload working without using Ajax and I performed the data extraction using an OleDB connection to access the file. The issue surrounds sending the data back to be inserted into the table. I had assumed I could use the Ajax.BeginForm helper method for uploading the file but this apparently does not work for file uploads anyone able to tell me why. So I need to find a way for sending the data back to the client using Ajax. Googling around Ive found many tools for ajax enabled file uploaders. The one Ive looked at using is p  pa hrefhttpvalums.comajaxupload relnofollowhttpvalums.comajaxuploadap  pThis works by returning a json success message when the file is uploaded. This does not fit with what Im trying to do because I dont want to store the file on the server but instead want to pass the data back. Im only learning JavaScript and JQuery so Im wondering can I just return the data in json format instead and create a handler on the client side to add it to a table Id appreciate any code snippets or direction on how to achieve this. p  pAlternatively if there is a better approach to doing this Id be happy to change my approach.p

Negative 9581 pI am running into a problem with viewing the build logs while a build is in progress. The build is being run on a seperate continious integration build machine and we are using VS2010 and Team Foundation Server to manage the build from our development client machines.p  pThe problem is that VS2010 will poll for the logs on the build server and update approx every 30 seconds. The solutions that are being built are pretty big and there are a lot of them. They generate a lot of warnings and logs at the moment which bloat the log considerably. Because of this it is nearly impossible to use VS2010 to view the build log until after the build has completed which is approx 85 minutes.p  pObviously  a solution would be to fix up all the warnings, but I was wondering if there is a way to prevent the build log viewer from polling  just list all the detail until a refresh is requested or even a way to extend the poll to say every 5 minutes would work for me.p  pI understand that the build log no longer gets written out to disk in VS2010  so I cant access it unless I go through the Build Explorer.p  pAny thoughts would be very much appreciated Jayp

Negative 9581 pSorry about the bad title I have a WebView I am loading from a previously saved WebArchive.  The archiveweb page is html with some JavaScript for menus and some images nothing special or weird.p  pI am saving the page to a WebArchive, changing an image in the website same name, different content, reloading the original WebArchive yet the WebView is showing the current online state Better longer explanation below in case this makes no sense.p  pWhat seems to be happening is that the WebViewArchive is fetching the online version of the image and probably other resources in preference to the resources in the WebArchive.  If I take the online site offline and try again, the WebView displayed the resources from the WebArchive i.e. in their state when the archive was saved.p  pI have tried messing around with different caching settings in the WebView and NSURLRequest through the WebView delegate.p  pWhen I view the archive in Safari the behaviour is the same.  e.g. with online site available, open saved archive in Safari and online versions of resources are displayed.  Make online site unavailable and open archive again and the cached versions of resources are used i.e. the online ones just displayed  not the ones from the WebArchive.  Refresh the page showing the archive with the online site unavailable and the resources revert to those saved in the archive.p  pWeb page uses a lot of relative addressing e.g. image imagespic.png.  In the WebResourceLoadDelegate the resource URL is showing as e.g. imagespic.png and the mainDocumentURL as .p  pFor the application it is important that I usedisplay the resources that were saved with the archive rather than any more recent cachedonline version.  Any ideas how I might achieve this or what I might be doing wrong.p  pMore detailed explanation of what is happening in case above makes more sense Application is to save complete webpages fetched using WebView and saved as WebArchive.  Application fetches web page and saves it.  The online website changes the content of a resource e.g. imagespic.png has same name but contains different image data.  Application then loads the WebArchive from earlier and displays it in a WebView.  The page displays fine but e.g. imagespic.png is the online version rather than the one saved in the WebArchive.  Close application.  Make online website unavailable e.g. stop Apache server.  Rerun application, reload same WebArchive from earlier and the imagespic.png is that from the archive.  i.e. the WebView seems to be trying to fetch the online version of the resource rather than that stored in the WebAchive.  Arc hive is stared to a file.  The to display fileNSDataWebArchiveWebViewloadArchive.p  precodeNSData pageData[[NSData alloc]initWithContentsOfFilepageDataFileAsString]         WebArchive webArchive[[WebArchive alloc]initWithDatapageData]         [[targetWebView mainFrame]loadArchivewebArchive] codepre  pNote  It is actually more weirdcomplex because going into more detail, the application actually displays as described above but two WebViews containing a before and after for the archive.  And they seem to be caching for each other so imagespic.png loaded in one will then be used by the other  so with tow different archives containing different imagespic.pngs the two resources display the same.p  pI have tried using the WebView WebResourceLoadDelegate to force everything to load from origin i.e.p  precode NSURLRequest webViewWebView sender resourceididentifier willSendRequestNSURLRequest request redirectResponseNSURLResponse redirectResponse fromDataSourceWebDataSource dataSource      NSMutableURLRequest newRequest[request mutableCopy]     [newRequest setCachePolicyNSURLRequestReloadIgnoringLocalCacheData]     returnnewRequest  codepre  palso set the WebView preferences to stop cachingp  precode[webPreferences setUsesPageCacheFALSE] [webPreferences setCacheModelWebCacheModelDocumentViewer] [webView setPreferenceswebPreferences] codepre  ul libut no success. and sorry about the long descriptionsli ul

Negative 9581 pI am trying to build a robust, simple, safe, catchall way to pass dynamic SQL queries via ajax to a php script.

For 6NF databases with a catalogue, I have a set of procs that   will [re]generate the SQL required to perform all SELECTs, and I   provide Views in 5NF for all users, so they do not need to know or   understand the underlying 6NF structure. They are driven off the   catalogue. Thus changes are easy and automated. EAV types do that   manually, due to the absence of the catalogue.p blockquoteli ul

This function will take a user inputed string from a web form in CodeIgniter and then from there analyze its content and then determine if the string is a photo ending in .jpg, .png, etc, a youtube video link, a vimeo video link, or just text.p  pIm just having a hard time trying to visualize the best, most economical way to do this.p  precodeif strposcontent, .jpg.png.bmp  return image  else if strposcontent, youtube.com  return youtube  else if strposcontent, vimeo.com  return vimeo  else  return text  codepre
Negative 9581 pI am trying to create a macro that will regularly move 25,000  35,000 lines in Excel, to an Access database. As I understand it, if Im working in an environment where people using the macro have different versions of Excel and Access I happen to be using 2007, Im best off using late binding, because it avoids problems with different references and versions,etc.  once it works, it works even though its slower. p  pIm trying to get the following code to work in Excel VBAp  precodeSub TransferToDB Dim acApp As Object  ssheet  CDocuments and SettingsykDesktopOpen Invoice Summary 322  20120717.xlsx ssrange  AllDataA1M28323  Set acApp  CreateObjectAccess.Application     acApp.OpenCurrentDatabase CDocuments and SettingsykDesktopOpen Invoice Summary.accdb     acApp.Visible  True     acApp.UserControl  True     DoCmd.TransferSpreadsheet acImport, acSpreadsheetTypeExcel9, OpenInvoices, ssheet, True, ssrange     acApp.CloseCurrentDatabase     acApp.Quit Set acApp  Nothing   End Sub codepre  pWhen the macro gets to the DoCmd.TransferSpreadsheet line, it stops with an errorp  blockquote   pRuntime error 424 p      pObject requiredp blockquote  pThis routine in Excel gets called from another routine that gathers information from many worksheets in a large workbook, and dumps it all in a sheet called AllData in that workbook.

Negative 9581 pI am writing a desktop application in C using the MVVM pattern with  an Entity Framework model. I tend to use DependencyProperties in my VMs and have come to generally prefer this system over implementing INotifyPropertyChanged. I would like to keep things consistent. My VM accesses the Entities in the Model and I have managed to keep things pretty separate  the View has no knowlege of the VM except for binding and command names and the Model has know knowlege of the VM. p  pUsing INotifyPropertyChanged in the VM, it seems pretty easy to update the Entities in the Modelp  precodepublic string Forename              get  return CurrentPerson.Forename          set                      if Forename  value                              CurrentPerson.Forename  value                 NotifyPropertyChangedForename                            codepre  p...where CurrentPerson is a Person object autocreated by the Entity Data Model. There is therefore no private field created specifically to store the Forename.p  pWith DependencyProperties, it appears that I would have to create a DP, add the default Property, using GetValue and Setvalue and then use the PropertyChangedCallback in order to update the CurrentPerson Entity. Calling a callback in this situation appears to be adding overhead for the sake of being consistent with my other VMs.p  pThe question is therefore whether one or other of these methods is the way I emshouldem do things In this instance, should I use a DependencyProperty or INotifyPropertyChanged One thing that should be pointed out is that this will potentially be a very large scale project with plugins and a lot of database accesses from different machines and that everything really should be as reusable, and the modules as disconnected, as possible.p

Negative 9581 pI am creating a Facebook Open Graph action for my app, that has a potential of being published many times for each user e.g, each time a user listens to a song on the site. For some users, I may have hundreds of such actions per session or per day.p  pQuestion is  does Facebook pose limits on how many times an app publishes Open Graph actions Obviously, Facebook will not show all those actions on feeds, and will probably show just the first ones, if any. But is it the applications responsibility to throttle the publishing, or is it encouraged to publish the real amount of actionsp  pIf the app should throttle, what is a reasonable number of actions per user per dayp

Negative 9581 pIm brand new to Redis, and am just experimenting with caching some data and seeing how memory usageperformance compares to other options like Memcached.  Im using ServiceStack.Redis client library via a hrefhttpsgithub.comServiceStackServiceStack.RediswikiIRedisClient relnofollowIRedisClientap  pI have been testing Redis, and 25k keyvalue objects is pushing around 250MB of memory, with a 100MB dump.rdb file.  I need to cache a lot more than this, and am looking to reduce the memory consumption if possible.  My best guess is that each cache items text JSON blob is around 4k in size, but if my basic math is correct, each item is consuming around 10k in Redis from a memory footprint point of view at least.  The vast difference between the dump size and the in memory size is a bit alarming to me.p  pIm also running on 64bit VM right now, which I understand wastes a lot of extra space compared to 32bit, so ill look into that as well.  Looks like redis needs 2x the memory for each pointer per keyvalue cached.  Could this be where the 2.5x diskmemory ratio is coming from  p  pI understand I can write code on my side to deal with the compressiondecompression of data on the way inout of Redis, but just curious if there is some way to configure the client library to do something similar with say a hrefhttpsgithub.comServiceStackServiceStackblobmastersrcServiceStack.CommonStreamExtensions.cs relnofollowStreamExtensionsa.  p  pUsage pattern is ready heavy, with infrequent writes, andor batch cache refresh writes.p  pAnyway, looking for any suggestions on how to get more cache items for a given amount of memory.p

There are multiple threads that will call wakethread. When wakethread returns it MUST guarantee that C is either running or will be woken. wakethread must NEVER block.p  pThe easy way is of course to do use a synchronisation event like thisp  precodehEvent  CreateEventNULL, FALSE, TRUE, NULL  void wakethreadthread     SetEventhEvent  codepre  pAndp  precodevoid sleepthreadthread    WaitForSingleObjecthEvent  codepre  pThis provides the desired semantics and is free of race conditions for the scenario There is only one thread waiting, but multiple that can signal. I included it here to show what I am trying to tune. p  pHOWEVER, I am wondering there is a faster way under Windows for this very specific scenario. strongwakethreadstrong may be called a lot, even when C is not sleeping. This causes a lot of calls to SetEvent that do nothing. Would there be a faster way to use manual reset event and reference counters to make sure SetEvent is only called when there is actually something to set.p  pEvery CPU cycle counts in this scenario.p

That is, that offset and offset  length fall in bytes.p  pThe explicit check would look something likep  precodeif offset lt 0  offset gt bytes.length  length    throw ...   bad santa  codepre  pIt seems that I can perform this more cheaply in terms of emitted bytecode, and perhaps runtime performance by performing dummy array access insteadp  precodepublic int indexOfbyte[] bytes, byte toFind, int offset, int length    int dummy  bytes[offset]  bytes[offset  length  1]   ...  codepre  pId like to get rid of the codeint dummycode and codecode if I could, or reduce their cost.  The compiler doesnt like standalone accesses like codebytes[offset]code, presumably because an expression like this usually doesnt have side effects and is pointless but not so in this case. Using the dummy int also causes a compiler warning which must be suppressed.p  pAny suggestions on how I can make the change with a minimum amount of bytecode runtime performance is important here too, but I suspect that most solutions are optimized to the same thing as unused portions are dropped.p

Negative 9581 pIm in the process of updating a legacy application to use Java 6 SE instead of Java 5 SE. The app uses JAXB, and under Java 5 SE it have the JAXB reference implementation jars on the classpath. When I moved to Java 6 SE update 38, I hit a few bumps see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14223852jaxbdateconversionsfailaftermovingfromjava5setojava6selinked Stackoverflow questiona that I resolved with some help.p  pSo the next thing that is causing trouble is the project Ant build script. When the Ant compile task executes, it picks up the embedded version of JAXB that comes with Java 6 SE rather than the version from the jars that I have included on the classpath the JAXB 2.2.6 release. I believe Java 6 SE includes JAXB 2.1.x. This is causing compile time error like thisp  precode[javac] location interface javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlElementRef [javac]     XmlElementRefname  abbrev, type  JAXBElement.class, required  false codepre  pIn this case, the required attribute did not exist in for the XmlElementRef in JAXB 2.1.x, but it does in 2.2.x.p  pstrongHow can I change my Ant build script so that it picks up the JAXB 2.2.6 jars from the build classpath instead of the classes that are packed inside the Java 6 SE JDKstrongp  hr  pstrongUPDATEstrong Solution based on Peters answerp  precodelttarget namecompile dependscleangt     ltjavac deprecationon              classpathrefprj.classpath              srcdirsrc              destdirbuild.dir              debugon              debuglevellines,vars,source              source1.6gt         ltcompilerarg valueDjava.endorsed.dirslib.ext.dirjaxbgt     ltjavacgt lttargetgt codepre

However I get problems trying to do much within the html bindings with the child entities and, on checking in chromes console, it appears it may be because the child entities, unlike the parent, are not declared as dependentobservable, they are just plain objects.p  precodeviewmodel defines parent as           games  ko.observableArray[] codepre  pEvaluation in consolep  precodedata     Object         games Object[0]         latestValue Array[7]         0 Game         1 Game         2 Game             gtGameDateTime function dependentObservable              gtHomeGame function dependentObservable              gtID function dependentObservable              gtLeagueGame function dependentObservable              gtMVP function dependentObservable              gtMVPPersonID function dependentObservable              gtNLorRL ltstronggtNLltstronggt A             gtOpponent function dependentObservable              gtSets Object[0]             gtTeamerMVP Object[0] codepre  pIn the expanded node you can see that the parent entitylevel properties GameDateTime, HomeGame, etc. are created as dependentobservables but the child entities Sets, TeamerMVP are not and Im guessing this is why Im having some trouble in the html template bindings doing things like foreach as knockout simply doesnt seem to see those child entities.p  pIs there something Im missing  Should I be creating a games.Sets  ko.observableArray[] declaration in the viewmodel to act as a container for the child entity when its createdp  pThe json data returned shows the followingp  precodeTeamerMVP [id20, typelbD.model.TeamerMVP, lbD.model, GameID3, PersonID4,]     0 id20, typelbD.model.TeamerMVP, lbD.model, GameID3, PersonID4,     id 20     type lbD.model.TeamerMVP, lbD.model     GameID 3     Person id21, typelbD.model.Person, lbD.model, ID4, NameMike Connor, isAdminfalse,     PersonID 4 codepre  pand its easy to see the Name property within the related Person table.p  pEdited to add Its just the TeamerMVP relationship that is troublesome. Just managed to do something with a forEach on the Sets entity so thats working fine, even though its not a dependentobservable.... Im puzzled.p  pFurther edited for Wards questionp  pAt breakpoint as requested I see these listedp  precodebreezeConfig.manager.metadataStore.structuralTypeMap Object   gtGamelbD.model ctor   gtGameSetlbD.model ctor   gtPersonlbD.model ctor   gtTeamerMVPlbD.model ctor   gtVenuelbD.model ctor   gtproto Object codepre  pThese are the concrete table names from my simple database.  If I expand GameSet then one of the properties is defaultResourceName Sets which is the navigation property name defined in model as Public Overridable Property Sets As ICollectionOf GameSet.p  pAh... just expanded TeamerMVP and its defaultresourcename is TeamerMVPs which is a small but subtle difference  I dont recall defining a version with the s on the end anywhere and a quick search of the project reveals no results.  Curious.  Maybe thats the issue, Ill have a quick play with the html bindings now.  p  pEdit 3 HTML Bindings infop  pNope, not playing ball at all... p  pI have this templatep  precode ltscript typetexthtml idTeamerMVPTemplategt     ltdivgtTeamer MVPsampnbspltdivgt     ltli databindtext Person.Namegtltligt ltscriptgt codepre  pWhich is embedded in another template the main foreach games one which is where it is referenced p  precodeltspan classfixtureBoxLine databindtemplate  name setScoresTemplate, foreach Sets gtltspangt ltspan classfixtureBoxLine databindtemplate  name TeamerMVPTemplate, foreach TeamerMVPs gtltspangt codepre  p...and it just silently breaks. No error message but the processing stops on the first loop of the first game.  The foreach Sets template immediately above it works perfectly.p  pIf I change foreach TeamerMVPs back to foreach TeamerMVP in the binding declaration above, all games are processed but nothing is shown in the template for TeamerMVP so I guess TeamerMVPs is the correct entity reference and theres something odd going on with the way Im trying to access it. Is Person.Name the correct binding in the templatep  pp  pEdit 4 Clarification of modelp  pmanager.metadataStore.getEntityTypeGame.navigationProperties returns 4 navigation properties.  This is correct, there should be a collection of 0 to many Sets, a collection of 0 to many TeamerMVP, a 0 to one MVP and a 0 to one Venue. All are present.p  pThere can be only one or none MVP but it is entirely correct for there to be 0 to many TeamerMVP. This relationship is set up in exactly the same way as the Sets relationship that works.  The only slight difference being that the TeamerMVP tavle itself has a 1to1 relationship with the Person table as any TeamerMVP must be a valid person.  This is why my breeze query defines an expand that refers to TeamerMVP.Person and this appears to work as the json data returned is exactly as I would expect.   In the raw json, the navigation property is referred to as TeamerMVP and it is only in the structuraltypemap that the defaultResourceName is referred to as TeamerMVPs.p  pIf I leave the html binding as forEach TeamerMVP then all games are returned and bound to the foreach games parent template as expected, but no data are bound to the TeamerMVP template and no errors are shown in the console.  If I change the binding to foreach TeamerMVPs then only one game is returned and then processing stops at the point that the binding would occur and data would be shown.  No error is show in the console, however.p  pIt appears as if breeze is creating the navigation property as TeamerMVPs internally and yet the json is returning TeamerMVP and maybe that disparity is why the binding appears to work and yet no data are bound  Its way above my comprehension at presentp  pp  pEdit 5 Add model informationp  pstrongGame Modelstrongp  precodePublic Class Game     Public Property ID As Integer     Public Property GameDateTime As System.DateTime     Public Property Opponent As String     Public Property HomeGame As Boolean     Public Property LeagueGame As Boolean     Public Property MVPPersonID As NullableOf Integer     Public Property VenueID As NullableOf Integer     Public Property isNL As Boolean      Public Overridable Property Sets As ICollectionOf GameSet     Public Overridable Property MVP As Person     Public Overridable Property TeamerMVP As ICollectionOf TeamerMVP     Public Overridable Property Venue As Venue End Class codepre  pstrongTeamerMVP Modelstrongp  precodePublic Class TeamerMVP     Public Property GameID As Integer     Public Property PersonID As Integer      Public Overridable Property Person As Person End Class codepre  pstrongPerson Modelstrongp  precodePublic Class Person     Public Property ID As Integer     Public Property Name As String     Public Property isAdmin As Boolean     Public Property email As String     Public Property type As String     Public Property Image As String     Public Property thumbImage As String     Public Property backImage1 As String     Public Property backImage2 As String     Public Property Height As String     Public Property YearStarted As String     Public Property Position As String     Public Property PreviousClubs As String     Public Property ShirtNumber As String     Public Property isNL As Boolean      Public Overridable Property GamesMVP As ICollectionOf Game     Public Overridable Property GamesTeamerMVP As ICollectionOf Game End Class codepre  pstrongGameSet Modelstrongp  precodePublic Class GameSet     Public Property ID As Integer     Public Property GameID As Integer     Public Property SetNo As Integer     Public Property ourScore As Integer     Public Property theirScore As Integer      Public Overridable Property Game As Game End Class codepre  pUsing codebreezeConfig.manager.getEntitiesTeamerMVPcode in the console at the success breakpoint does indeed reveal a whole load of TeamerMVP entities.

Negative 9581 pYesterday, I edited the codebinactivatecode script of my virtualenv so that it sets the codePYTHONPATHcode environment variable to include a development version of some external package. I had to do this because the codesetup.pycode of the package uses codedistutilscode and does not support the codedevelopcode command  la codesetuptoolscode. Setting codePYTHONPATHcode works fine as far as using the Python interpreter in the terminal is concerned.p  pHowever, just now I opened the project settings in PyCharm and discovered that PyCharm is unaware of the external package in question  PyCharm lists neither the external package nor its path. Naturally, thats because PyCharm does not and cannot reliably parse or source the codebinactivatecode script. I could manually add the path in the PyCharm project settings, but that means I have to repeat myself once in codebinactivatecode, and again in the PyCharm project settings. Thats not DRY and thats bad.p  pCreating, in codesitepackagescode, a symlink that points to the external package is emalmostem perfect. This way, at least the source editor of PyCharm can find the package and so does the Python interpreter in the terminal. However, somehow PyCharm still does not list the package in the project settings and Im not sure if its ok to leave it like that.p  pSo how can I add the external package to my virtualenvproject in such a way thatp  ol liI dont have to repeat myself andli liboth the Python interpreter and PyCharm would be aware of itli ol

Negative 9581 pa hrefhttpwww.andrewsmorris.co.ukblog relnofollowhttpwww.andrewsmorris.co.ukblogap  pI have a sidebar that slides out when you click the button on the left, the problem however, is that on iOS I get horizontal scroll bars on the page when I click it. Which I dont when I click it on a desktop browser, because it adds a class with overflowhidden to the body class.p  pIn theory this should prevent the same unwanted horizontal scrolling on the iPhone too, but it doesnt for reasons i cannot work out.p  pI could apply overflowxhidden to the html element, but that seems to jump the page to the top regardless of where you are, which is unwanted behaviour.p

Negative 9581 phere is an issue I have never seen before and thought it would be shareworthy. Im not sure why it happens though.p  pThis is how I invoke my programp  blockquote   p.foo switch1 arg1 switch2 arg2 switch3 arg3arg4arg5 switch4 arg6p blockquote  pEach switch is used to indicate a different type of argument and I parse them accordingly.p  pThe problem occurs with switch3, which indicates that codearg3code, codearg4code, codearg5code all correspond to the same switch and are delineated using the codecode character.p  pFor some reason, I can run the program perfectly, but when I try to debug it using gdb, My program crashes with a codeduring startup, program exited with code 127code error.p  pHeres what intrigues me. It also says codebinbash arg4 not foundcode. It takes the argument right after the first codecode character, which now I assume it perceives as the pipe character, and tries to invoke a bash script.p  pWhy does this happen Doesnt the compiler take the entire command line string and consider space separated tokens as different arguments Why is the codecode being interpreted differently I tried adding codearg3arg4arg5code in inverted quotes codecode, and it works fine. I also tried separating them by codecode, eg. codearg3arg4arg5code, and this works fine too.p

Negative 9581 pI have some functions which take very specific matrices with specific information loaded in using another function Ive made. Currently the matrices the function accepts are the normal R matrix type. However Id like to assign them as a different type or class so as to achieve easy input checking so the user cant throw any matrix into the function.p  pI figured the S3 method would be easy after seeing a few examples on the netp  precodemat1 lt matrixc110,ncol5  colnamesmat1 lt cONE,TWO,THREE,FOUR,FIVE  as.sdpmgdna lt functionx    classx lt sdpmgdna   returnx   mat2 lt as.sdpmgdnamat1 codepre  pThis appears to work in so far as if I return mat2 I see a matrix, and if I call it via indecies mat2[1,2] I get the right values I should get. However I cant be sure some things have changed  it is now described as sdpmgdna[10] i.e. it seems to ignore it has 2 dimensions, although doing the above and printing mat2 to screen shows it clearly does have 2 dimensions. Another odd thing is if I do codecolnamesmat2code they are returned. However if I try to find the colname of an individual column e.g. codecolnamemat2[,4]code then the value returned is codeNULLcode. Can anyone explain why this is or what I should do  I really want it to basically be a matrix, but because the functions require it to be very specific in terms of a matrix of what and how big, defining it as another class would make error and input checking so much easier  and allow me to use the methods mechanism of R so all my custom plotting functions could just be methods of plot.p

Negative 9581 pI have few question while implementing the subversion for my project using svnkit library.p  p1 I checkout a file from repository and made changes locally, before i commit other user checkout the same file and made changes and committed the file.

Negative 9581 pLet me know if this question needs more clarification.p  pI am a frontend developer, and I usually use Wordpress with lots of custom fields to put together a CMS for clients.p  pA current client wants a design portfolio site that initially presents a grid of images that link to projects, but instead of loading a new page on click, the new content loads and fades in smoothly.p  pI figure the simplest way to do this kind of thing is to load everything up front on one page with ajax a loading screen is OK, and then just showhidemove content with jQuery.p  pThe request I am having trouble with is being able to have specific URLs for different projects and images. The client wants a URL scheme like here a hrefhttpcollins1.comworkbphelioshouse3 relnofollowhttpcollins1.comworkbphelioshouse3ap  pWhere the number at the end causes a specific image to load in the given project. It seems like this would be simple enough using php variables where likep  pa hrefhttpwww.whatever.comproject3ampimage2 relnofollowhttpwww.whatever.comproject3ampimage2ap  pAnd using those to manipulate the initial AJAX load.p  pBut how is this accomplished using a more traditional pretty URL structure like the example If I am building the site as one page loading content, wont the browser attempt to load that as a page and just come up with a 404p  pBonus How do you change the URL in the address bar to create these links as the user navigates the site without reloading the pagep  pThanksp

Negative 9581 pIn order to load some geojson data, I need to source scripts on an external domain, say codehttpwww.stat.ucla.edujeroenfileslacountysimplified.min.jsoncode. I have no control over the contents of this script all I know is the url, and the name of an object defined in the script that I am interested in. A dummy version of the script looks likep  precodevar mydata  foo  123, bar  456 codepre  pNow in my application, I would like to load the codemydatacode object dynamically from its URL. Because it is cross domain, I cant use ajax. It isnt quite codejsonpcode either, because my script defines an object, not a function. One way would be to insert it simply as a codeltscriptgtcode in the head of the current document. However, I would like to avoid possible side effects.p  pWhat would be a cleaner solution I was thinking of creating an codeltiframegtcode and then inserting the codeltscriptgtcode tag in the iframe, and extracting the object once the iframe has loaded. However I am not sure this is a reliable method that will work cross browsers especially binding a callback to extract the object after the script has been loaded in the iframe. p  pIs there some library or standard solution to load a script in a clean page, and extract copy over a particular object to the main page I already have a dependency on jQuery so that would be fine.p

Negative 9581 pYesterdays Code Jam had a question titled Falling Diamonds.  The full text can be found a hrefhttpcode.google.comcodejamcontest2434486dashboardsp1 relnofollow titlehereherea, but in summaryp  ul liDiamonds fall down the Y axis.   li liIf a diamond hits point to point with another diamond, there is a 5050 chance it will slide to the right or left, provided it is not blocked from doing so. li liIf a diamond is blocked from sliding one direction, it will always slide the other way.li liIf a diamond is blocked in both directions, it will stop and rest on the blocking diamonds. li liIf a diamond hits the ground, it will bury itself half way, then stop. li liThe orientation of the diamond never changes, i.e. it will slide or sink, but not tumble. li liThe objective is to find the probability that a diamond will rest at a given coordinate, assuming N diamonds fall.li ul  pThe above requirements basically boil down to the diamonds building successively larger pyramids, one layer at a time.p  pSuffice to say, I have not been able to solve this problem to googles satisfaction.  I get the sample from the problem description correct, but fail on the actual input files.  Ideally I would like to see a matched input and correct output file that I can play with to try and find my error.  Barring that, I would also welcome comments on my code.p  pIn general, my approach is to find how many layers are needed to have one which contains the coordinate.  Once I know which layer I am looking at, I can determine a number of values relevant to the layer and point we are trying to reach.  Such as how many diamonds are in the pyramid when this layer is empty, how many diamonds can stack up on a side before the rest are forced the other way, how many have to slide in the same direction to reach the desired point, etc.  p  pI then check to see if the number of diamonds dropping either makes it impossible to reach the point probability 0, or guarantees we will cover the point probability 1.  The challenge is in the middle ground where it is possible but not guaranteed.  p  pFor the middle ground, I first check to see if we are dropping enough to potentially fill a side and force remaining drops to slide in the opposite direction.  Reason being that in this condition we can guarantee that a certain number of diamonds will slide to each side, which reduces the number of drops we have to worry about, and resolves the problem of the probability changing when a side gets full.  Example if 12 diamonds drop it is guaranteed that each side of the outer layer will have 2 or more diamonds in it, whether a given side has 2, 3, or 4 depends on the outcome of just 2 drops, not of all 6 that fall in this layer.p  pOnce I know how many drops are relevant to success, and the number that have to break the same way in order to cover the point, I sum the probabilities that the requisite number, or more, will go the same way.p  pAs I said, I can solve the sample in the problem description, but I am not getting the correct output for the input files.  Unfortunately I have not been able to find anything telling me what the correct output is so that I can compare it to what I am getting.

When the exact same binary is installed as an ad hoc IPA the runtime problem does not occur. On devices that do not exhibit the runtime problem the above error messages are not logged during install from the App Store.p  pAs for the runtime problem, we do not know exactly what happens as it is not possible to debug the app. We have a hunch that it may be access to the keychain that fails and that it could be related to entitlements, but this is just a hunch and could very well be wrong.p  pIs there anything in the app itself that could be causing this or should we write this off as a system problem and advice users with this problem to restore their devicesp  pAny input greatly appreciatedp

However, I want to allow the user to update the connection string at run time as a user preference. Ive found a workaround to update the connection string as an applicationlevel setting, but there are probably reasons why its readonly and I feel like Im implementing a bad practice. Should I set this setting at the user level insteadp

And when I try it on my device running 4.0.3, the arrows are there even though if it should display codenet.simonvt.numberpicker.NumberPickercode, they wouldnt be.strikep  pI hope the question is understandable.

Negative 9581 pIll start by explaining what the current set up is and then go onto where it needs to be.p  pCurrently we have a local SQL Server database for a CMS. The database is updated from other servers on site to update product information to display on the website, and CMS information is updated from an MVC application.p  pMoving forward we need to have a remote server with a SQL Server database that is an identical copy of the local database, this database will never be updated from the remote location.p  pThe problem arises when attempting to design a method to sync the data from the local database to the remote server with no downtime on either end. I know SQL Server Enterprise has features that would help in this case, but we do not have a licence for it at this time.p  pThe best idea we have come up with is to log ship to the remote server, create a restore from database that is receiving the logs being shipped and then update the websites codeweb.configcode to point to the newly restored database. This could work, but seems overly complicated and we have an issue of an ever changing database name.p  pIf any one could think of a bettersimpler solution or a way to make the current idea better it would be much appreciated.p  pIf anything is not clear or more info is needed let me know.p

Negative 9581 pIm developing a Spring MVC web application using Windows 7, Eclipse Juno, Eclipselink JPA as ORM and Glassfish as application server with Oracle 11g. While I was working with Eclipselink I noticed when I update a table manually by execute an update PLSQL query it doesnt has any affect on entities that already retrieved by Eclipselink until restart the server. Although, I disabled Eclipselink cache by having codeltsharedcachemodegtNONEltsharedcachemodegtcode in persistance.xml and using codeEntityManager.clearcode, codeEntityManager.closecode and codeCacheablefalsecode.p  pThen, I noticed when I update tables using OracleSQLDeveloper table designer it totally works fine and entities are showing updated information. So I checked SQLDeveloper log to see what query its using to update rows and I saw that its using ORAROWSCN and ROW ROWID in where clause. After that, I exactly used the same where clause as the one SQLDeveloper used to update tables, but still entities were showing old information.p  pIm wondering what factors are involved here that Eclipslink is not fetching real time data from database  but, after updating table with SQLDeveloper designer Eclipselink is showing real time data. It seems that modifying a table data with SQLDeveloper table designer also marks the table as changed by using some database features. Then, Eclipselink will read the mark before hitting the table.p  pAlso to get more clarification, anyone knows what steps are involved in Eclipselink before it decides to hit database when user commands to execute a TypedQuery  Im so curious that where it stores cached entities  since cache rest just by restarting the computer I tried restarting Glassfish, killing the java process and logoff current user, but none of them worked. Why Eclipselink still is caching entities since I configured it to not use any caching procedure Is it possible to completely turn off cache in Eclipselinkp

Negative 9581 pIn our ASP.NET application weve implemented a data layer built on top of MySQL, and which uses a hrefhttpdev.mysql.comdownloadsconnectornet relnofollowConnectorNETa in order to implement the Entity Framework.p  pThis works perfectly well for most of our CRUD actions, but when we run an INSERT statement with several hundred records it throws a Too many connections exception.p  pWhile I accept that we are making a lot of separate readwrite calls we query for duplicate entries prior to every insert, plus theres an audit log which is also written to using a separate query for every insert but shouldnt the connection pool take care of thisp  pAlso, in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17255024csharptoomanyconnectionsinmysqlthis similar threada the OP was told to use emusingem statements which I fully agree with, and in our case every query emisem already wrapped in a emusingem statement which I assume is managing the connections in an efficient manner emi.e.em, not disposing of them if another request has been queued.p  pAnd anyway, the codeconnect timeoutcode is currently 50, which is already pretty small, right Moving it up to 500 made no difference, while moving it down to 10 gave me about 50 more inserts before the same exception was thrown.p  pSo, given that every instance of the DbContext is wrapped in a emusingem statement, why are we getting a Too many connections exceptionp  pstrongUPDATEstrong We found that the root of our problem was actually caused by one of our repositories opening a DB connection in its constructor, even though this connection was never used. Sorry guys, this turned out to be a red herring. Thanks for your suggestions.p

Negative 9581 pI am trying to implement my own messaging system for a Unity game. I have a basic version working  a very simplified example of this is as followsp  precode Messaging class  private DictionaryltType, ListltFuncltMessage, boolgtgtgt listeners  Set up by some other code.  public void AddListenerltTgtFuncltMessage, boolgt listener where T  Message      this.listeners[typeofT].Addlistener   public void SendMessageltTgtT message where T  Message      foreach FuncltMessage, boolgt listener in this.listeners[typeofT]          listenermessage         Some other class  private void Start      messaging.AddListenerltMyMessagegtthis.MessageHandler  Subscribe to messages of a certain type.   private bool MessageHandlerMessage message   We receive the message as the Message base type...     MyMessage message2  MyMessagemessage  ...so we have to cast it to MyMessage.      Handle the message.  codepre  pThis all works fine. What I would like to do now is implement some magic to allow the message handler to be called with the actual derived type, like thisp  precodeprivate bool MessageHandlerMyMessage message       Handle the message.  codepre  pThis would mean that the message handling code across thousands of scripts will not need to bother casting the Message object to the correct derived type  it will already be of that type. It would be far more convenient. I feel like this could be possible to achieve somehow using generics, delegates, expression trees, covariance andor contravariance, but Im just not getting itp  pIve been trying a lot of different things, and feel like I am getting close, but I just cant get there. These are the two partial solutions that Ive been able to come up withp  precode Messaging class  private DictionaryltType, ListltDelegategtgt listeners  Delegate instead of FuncltMessage, boolgt.  public void AddListenerltTgtFuncltT, boolgt listener where T  Message   FuncltT, boolgt instead of FuncltMessage, boolgt.     this.listeners[typeofT].Addlistener   public void SendMessageltTgtT message where T  Message      foreach Delegate listener in this.listeners[typeofT]          listener.Method.Invokemethod.Target, new object[]  message   Partial solution 1.         FuncltT, boolgtlistenermessage  Partial solution 2.       codepre  pPartial solution 1 works fine, but it uses reflection, which isnt really an option considering the performance  this is a game, and the messaging system will be used a lot. Partial solution 2 works, but only as long as the T generic parameter is available. The messaging system will also have a queue of Message objects that it will process, and T will not be available there.p  pIs there any way to achieve this I would greatly appreciate any help that anyone could offerp  pOne final thing to note is that I am using Unity, which uses Mono  .NET 4 is not an option, and as far as I know this rules out using dynamic.p
Negative 9581 pI have a table which populates data and it has a column Number of segments.I want to display a tooltip when the user moves his mouse over the number in the column.The tooltip will have a table which contains as many rows as the value in number of segments column and it will also have data regarding those segments which is available in the database. So basically tooltip is a table with details of each segments.p  pI need help on implementing this using javascript or any other free plugins.I have done some research and most of the sites show how to get the tooltip working but not dynamically bind data to it.So it will be helpful if somone can give me the codes as its an urgent task and i dont have much time for RampDp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 9581 pThere is already a similar question regarding a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10410343determineclasswhiledecodingobjectdecodinga, but I wanted to try summarize and see if I got the full picture right.p  pBasically Apple provides the NSCoder class that allows to encode and decode an object if it is sublcass of the NSCoding class. p  pInheriting from that class allows to use the NSCoder encode and decode functions provided by Apple that allow to serialize NSDataTypes and all primitive C structs and data types.p  pMy understanding of the NSCoder  a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaReferenceFoundationClassesNSCoderClassReferenceNSCoder.html relnofollowclass referencea is that the encodeObject function is able to detect which object type we pass and hence serialize it in the proper way.p  pInstaed, when using specif types of int e.g. int 64 Apple decided to provide a specific function as understanding the signature of the data wasnt that trivial I guess that in low levelel memory an int64 is relatively similar to an int as is a primitive data type and hence there is no NSObject signature from which Apple could reverse engineer the data type.p  pstrongIs my understanding correct Anyone has a different explanationstrongp  pI would also like to ask you some more explanation on the usage of stronga hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaReferenceFoundationClassesNSCoderClassReferenceNSCoder.htmlapplerefoccinstmNSCoderencodeRootObject3a relnofollowencodeRootObjectastrong function.

Negative 9581 pI have a Java SWING program with basically a single, simple window. The window contains a menu an a JPanel. Ideally, Id want to use the menu to choose an external jar file which is another SWING program and run it. The jar should then execute in the background and use the JPanel in my window instead of creating a new window on its own. Would this be possible My guess is that I should somehow expose or make available my JPanel to the external application, but I cant figure out how I could do this. Even a simple code snippet would be really appreciated. Thanks a lotp

Negative 9581 pI have written a HTML 5 application that uses AngularJS and interfaces with a Java REST backend running on Tomcat.  I use Spring Security to handle login and security.p  pWhen the user enters the website he is forwarded to a login page which creates a session and redirects to the index page. The REST calls that loads further data from the server then uses that session to authenticate. If there is no session in place, I fallback to basic authentication over HTTP, such that it is possible to invoke the REST endpoints separately from the web application.p  pThe problem I have now is when the session expires. This causes a codeHTTP 401 Unauthenticatedcode response from the server. I thought I can catch that error and redirect the user back to the login page with Javascript. However before my error handler is called, the browser first shows a login window, only if I click cancel my Javascript error handler can handle the response.p  pMy question is, is there a way to prevent the browser from showing this login window Or is this a general problem with my application designp  pThe alternative might be not to use a session at all and to cache username and password in the application. Then I need to send it with every REST call using basic authentication, would that be a better approachp  pThe following is the HTTP response from the serverp  precodeHTTP1.1 401 Unauthorized Server ApacheCoyote1.1 WWWAuthenticate Basic realmSpring Security Application ContentType texthtmlcharsetutf8 ContentLength 999 Date Mon, 30 Sep 2013 110034 GMT codepre  pstrongUpdatestrong It appears that the reason for this is the codeWWWAuthenticatecode header, which causes the browser to display the login dialog.p

Negative 9581 pI mean I want to make something for example tomorrow at 6 a.m.  clock based event p  pFor now the only variant I see is starting new timer with codeTimpeStampcode from codeFutureTime  Nowcodep  pBut this solution looks ugly, specially when I will have many events it will force me to have many timers or somehow make timer process nearly event first and then recalculate how long to wait on next event. And recalculate each time when I will push new event to events collection.p  pJust asking if there is something more sane compared to my solution Or maybe if there is already some freeforuse lib for it.p

Negative 9581 pI need to compile quantities from several warehouses that update their inventories periodically. The files are automatically loaded into tables in my MySQL database, but sometimes one warehouse might have a few more or less files than the others.  I need to add them all to determine the total quantity available from the entire network.p  pMy idea was to do p  precode    SELECT         IFNULLbranch01.qty,0          IFNULLbranch02.qty,0          IFNULLbranch03.qty,0  codepre  petc. through all warehouses joined asp  precode    FROM branch01          JOIN branch02         USING oespaced         JOIN branch03          USING oespaced codepre  petc. through all warehousesp  pI cant use LEFT JOIN or RIGHT JOIN because sometimes one warehouse might have missing entries and sometimes another might. If a sku is missing from one branchs file, Id prefer to still have the other branches added together, and just get a NULL, which would be converted to a 0 by the functions in the SELECT.  When Ive tested different joining solutions, I also seem to be getting Cartesian numbers of rows, which confuses me further. Any guidance is greatly appreciated. p  pJust a little clarification We need to join 17 tables.  Were not really concerned with the sum of a column, but more the individual values.  For instance, a table might represent a list of items a,b,c,d, and list quantities of 1,2,3,4. We would have that table from several different warehouses and we would need to find a total for the entire network.  If four warehouses had those values, we would want to see a,b,c,d with 4,8,12,16 as values for the total available. p

Negative 9581 pIm trying to create a cross domain sign in just like Google. So you have the same account for your youtube, gmail, google, etc. However, there are several questions Im confusing aboutp  pSuppose I have 5 websites, I dont want to transfer any data about the user besides hisher strongemail, username and passwordstrong.  If I have only 1 user database instead of 5, every time I call the user database to access users profile picture, username and etc, do I need to call the remote databasep  pIve been thinking about having a remote user and session database so every child site access that instead of local user and session database. But my application uses the table extensively and im worried about the performance of getting the data from a remote database every time.p  pHow can I implement this in a clean way so every child site can easily access the user info locally, and they also share the same loginlogout process just like Google and its products Im using a PHP framework called Yii with MySQLp  hr  pIve come up with the following solution and I posted it as an answer as well, please advice if there is any issue about this Thank you guys for help.p  ol liHave a user table in every child site, say child1.com amp child2.comli liHave a super user table in the parent site, say parent.comli liWhen user logs into child1.com, check identity, redirect to parent.comchild1 to register or login. Once its done, redirect back to child1 with an encrypted URL to login the user automatically. If the users info has changed from the parent database, we can sync it here to the child database, If its a register process instead of a login process, write the userid, username and email as well into the database so you can access this locally from child1.comli liWhen user logs into child2.com, it redirects to parent.comchild2, however, the users has been authenticated to parent1.com, so it redirects the user to child2 with out encrypted URL, so child2.com logs the user in directly.li liFor logout process, logout child1.com amp curl other encrypted logout link to logout this user from other sites say child2.com or parent.comli ol

Negative 9581 pSo I am working on a GrailsFlex toy project.  I have a controllerLoginController that I am using to perform backend authentication on my Flex app.  However, I have been unable to find my controller.  What I mean by that is I get a HTTP Status 404 error when trying to access p  precodehttplocalhost8080OrlandoGrailsLoginControllerlogin.json codepre  pHere is my sad, sad little controller as it is in its proofofconcept state.p  precodepackage orlandograils class LoginController       static allowedMethods  [login POST, login GET]      def loginString username, String password               return Hello       codepre  pIve seen the documentation concerning RESTful services, but they always seem to concern a domain object which I dont have.  In any case, I have also added this to my UrlMappings.groovy filep  precodeLoginControllerlogin.jsonresourceLoginController codepre  pAny help on what Im doing horribly wrong would be greatly appreciated. Also, is there a way to list Grails routes like one can with RoR or Symfony2p  pAlso, while the bulk of my services will be over the amf channels, my authentication is occurring over http.p
Negative 9581 pI am using the Django Test client django.test.Client to run view tests. Upon attempting to use the Test Client on my index function that handles post requests for logins, it continually fails the test even though the authentication successfully occurs.p  pHeres my testp  precodedef testloginself    response  self.client.postlogin, usernameuser, passwordpass     print response.content     self.assertInSESSIONKEY, self.client.session  codepre  pSo the reason i know the login process successfully works is because response.content yields HTML data from another view that can only be access if request.user.isauthenticated is true. In other words, they must be logged in for response.content to yield the logged in page. So given this, i can tell that the function obviously works for its practical purpose of logging the user in, however, ive been scouring the docs for hours trying to figure out why i cant access SESSIONKEY from the client session. All my reading suggests that the django test client is in fact stateful in nature and should store the session. p  pCan someone shed some light on thisp

Negative 9581 pIve got a CortexM4 based MCU linked to a FPGA via a 16bit parallel memory bus interface. In essence the FPGA behaves like an external memory mapped to the memory space of the MCU the MCU presents an address followed by either a data word write or reading the word presented by the FPGA read. p  pI want to protect both read and write against transmission errors both during addressing and data writeread. However, I dont expect many bit errors since the distance between both parts is short.p  pI can easily implement checking and generating of either parity, hamming codes or CRC inside the FPGA. However, doing the same checking and generating in the uC seems comparatively harder since I dont want to cripple the throughput. Without error detection, reading and writing of 16bit words takes around 46 processor cycles and is thus rather fast. Consequently I dont want to spend hundred of cycles on protective measures.p  pstrongIn the end I am looking for a moderately efficient error detection method for 16bit data that is implemented in a uC in as few cycles as possible.strongp

Since all code is getting loaded at once during startup it would take a lot of time for this.p  pI figured out a design but I am not sure if that would help..

Negative 9581 pFor example, I have a pretty simple custom control called LabeledTextBox that inherits from TextBox. Its just a TextBox with a watermark in it that has had its styling stripped down to a minimal appearance. I want to make it the base class for all of the other textboxes in my app.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comq8Pgc.jpg altenter image description herep  pI have another control, SearchTextBox, which inherits from that. It is quite similar, but has some controls on the right side and some triggers for the functionality of a typical search boxp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2kOuQ.jpg altenter image description herep  pAlready I have a problem, because SearchTextBox has no label in the UI. If I replace the ScrollViewer with a LabeledTextBox and make it codeBasedOnStaticResource xType uiLabeledTextBoxcode, that works, but only if I hook up with the Text property  in SearchTextBoxp  precodepublic override void OnApplyTemplate      LabeledTextBox ltb  GetTemplateChildPARTLabeledTextBox as LabeledTextBox     Binding binding  new BindingText              Source  this,         Mode  BindingMode.TwoWay,         UpdateSourceTrigger  UpdateSourceTrigger.PropertyChanged          ltb.SetBindingLabeledTextBox.TextProperty, binding     base.OnApplyTemplate  codepre  pSo obviously, I am missing something here... Since it is based on LabeledTextBox, why doesnt SearchTextBox have a label by default in the UI even though it does have the label property Or are you not meant to inherit styles like thisp  pI also notice that if I create a custom control that inherits from LabeledTextBox and whose style is empty codeltStyle TargetTypexType uiTest BasedOnStaticResource xType uiLabeledTextBox gtcode, then it looks just like a LabeledTextBox... So shouldnt there be something I can put in the template that basically says, put everything from LabeledTextBox here, then add some extra stuff defined afterward, just like in normal class

Since my dataset is expected to have a varying range between the minimum and maximum values for date it can be a period of one month or several years, I decided to use multiscale format for the ticks on my xaxis instead of fixing the format and interval into weeks, months, years, etc. For example, if I leave the tick format the same way it is given in the sample code on GitHubp  precodevar xAxis  d3.svg.axis .scalex .orientbottom .ticksd3.time.weeks codepre  pand if the range of dates in my dataset spans for several years, the legend of the xaxis becomes crowded and unreadable.p  pI tried to use multiscale format, but the visualization will not be drawn and the Dev tool of my browser returns the following errorp  blockquote   pd3.time.format.multi is not a functionp blockquote  pI

Negative 9581 pI sometimes create macros for excell in visual basic. But I never user it for a PowerPoint. I have a powerpoint with a lot of pictures. The pictures are all in a directory. Sometimes I change the pictures in the directory keeping their original name. Obviously in PowerPoint there is no way to refresh the new versions of the pictures. But I could right click on picture and change the picture selecting the same path. Anyway I have too much pictures and I have to change the files often. So I was wondering if there is a way to do with visual basic. I could create a vector with the name of the files in the directory putting the names in the same order that they appear in the ppt. Then create a macro that change again all paths so the pictures will upgrade. I have no idea a about the code I could use. Somebody can help mep

Negative 9581 pwe recently switched to strongGunicornstrong using the stronggeventstrong worker.p  pOn our website, we have a few tasks that take a while to do. Longer than 30 seconds.p  h2Preambleh2  pemWe did the whole celery thing already, but these tasks are run so rarely that its just not feasible to keep celery and redis running all the time. We just do not want that. We also do not want to start celery and redis on demand. We want to get rid of it. Im sorry for this, but I want to prevent answers that go like Why dont you use celery, its greatemp  h2The tasks we want to run asynchronouslyh2  pIm talking about tasks that perform 3000 SQL queries inserts that have to be performed one after each other. emThis is not done all too oftenem. We limited to running only 2 of these tasks at once as well. They should take like strong23 minutesstrong.p  h2The approachh2  pNow, what we are doing now is taking advantage of the gevent worker and codegevent.spawncode the task and return the response.p  h2The problemh2  pI found that the spawned threads are actually blocking. As soon as the response is returned, the task starts running and no other requests get processed until the task stops running. The task will be killed after 30s, the gunicorn codetimeoutcode. In order to prevent that, I use codetime.sleepcode after every other SQL query, so the server gets a chance to respond to requests, but I dont feel like this is the point.p  h2The setuph2  pWe run gunicorn, django and use gevent. The behaviour described occurs in my dev environment and using 1 gevent worker. In production, we will also run only 1 worker for now. Also, running 2 workers did not seem to help in serving more requests while a task was blocking. p  h2TLDRh2  ul liWe consider it feasible to use a gevent thread for our 2 minute task over celery li liWe use gunicorn with gevent and wonder why a thread spawned with gevent.spawn is blockingli liIs the blocking intended or is our setup wrongli ul  pThank youp

Negative 9581 pI started working with REST services recently. I have several tools joined into the framework of integrated tools. Tools communicate over the common component CC which handles their requests using REST services and is actually an interface between all the tools. For every POST request a new resource is created and stored into memory. Every time the CC goes off all the data is lost. For that case, I created an Apache Derby database to store all the resources. With every resource creation, entry is created in the database. Every time CC turns on it fetches all the data from the database and the data is regurally synced. The problem is that multiple tools can POST at almost the same time. How does REST handle these requests I hoped that it manages the requests in a queuelike way, but from what I see it does it at the same time in a threadlike way. My database goes down instantly. Am I on the right track or something else could be wrongimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYLQ7J.png altTool Integration Frameworkp

Negative 9581 pIve recently begun working on a legacy codebase, in an environment where SVN 1.5.5 is used as the repository. The development team here has had enough difficulties with the mechanics of SVN branching that it has been abandoned. Id like to maintain the practice of branching when appropriate, and have run into some difficulties that I have never experienced using SVN before.p  pWhen merging trunk into a branch, we find many tens of files that have not been changed are listed as modified, and they tend to conflict heavily. SVN displays the conficts as portions of the file intermingled with itself. Since no one has actually edited these files, its easy to pick the correct version, and move on, but this still leaves developers with an insecure feeling about the process. Then, when merging the branch back into trunk, the same set of files that no one edited will conflict. This is in addition to other annoying conflicts that the svn merge algorithm is notorious for creating when files are legitimately edited in one or both branch or trunk. p  pWe typically branch and merge back in a hrefhttpwww.sepcot.comblog200704SVNMergeBranchTrunk relnofollowas is done in this guidea. However, there are 1215 people on the development team which would interact directly with the repository, and I cant guarantee everyone follows best practices 100 of the time. There also have been many other developers on this project over the last 8 years. p  pWe also see a lot of conflicts on svn mergeinfo on files that no one has edited. Every time this happens, its a completely different set of files, but its guaranteed to happen anytime branching is involved. The longer the time has passed since the branch was created, the more mystery conflicts that result.p  pSometimes these many conflicted but not edited files are predictable with the dryrun option. Sometimes, using dryrun wont display any unexpected conflicts, but then running the same merge command ends up conflicting around 45 files that had no changes. p  pIf I run svn propget svnmergeinfo at the root of my trunk, I get a big list of branchnames and the revision numbers they cover, such asp  precodebranches5activefeature2762927780 branches7autofriendfeature4368643693 branches7mobilenavigation4543045690 branches8tracking4444244719 branches9videomodule4538845418 branches9episodeguide4523345287 ... branches11redesign2828928395,4697348171 codepre  p54 lines like that, total. Is that an expected output of propget mergeinfo  just a list of branchesp  pIm at the point where I believe something is broken, and that this cant be an expected consequence of branchingmerging in a seemingly default way. I used SVN For over a year from 200708, and never had problems of this magnitude. However, Im not so sure where to start looking for a resolution. Some colleagues and I have considered the followingp  ul lipOur svn version 1.5.5 is bugged.

Negative 9581 pIm currently working on creating a test harness for a web service. The test harness is going to be setup as a sharepoint site with infopath forms demoing each service call. The issue Im running into is I want to be able to display the raw xml response in a textboxrich textbox. Assigning the dataFields from the service call to a textbox does display the returned data but the xml tags are stripped out. Ive googled for this but most searches with infopath and xml produce results to do with editing an infopath form. How can I display the raw xml with the tags includedp  pThanks for your helpp

I get a floating point as time where codedatetime.date.fromordinalinttimecode returns the date and codetotimetime  inttime86400code would return the time. I can than combine them to my datetimeobject. So the input would be for example 734869.00138889, which should result in 20130101 0002p  pI would definitely prefer a less crowded method.p

Everythings working  but what do I do with my data nowp  pMy main data set is basically an ArrayList of instances of the following classp  precodepackage com.gmail.zkfreddit.mousetracker  import de.ksquared.system.mouse.MouseEvent  public class MouseMotionData         public final long time     public final int x     public final int y      public MouseMotionDataMouseEvent e          time  System.nanoTime         x  e.getX         y  e.getY           Override     public String toString          return MouseMotionDatatime  time  ,x  x  ,y  y         codepre  pHowever, Im clueless as to how I could visualize this data. a hrefhttppuu.shcARovd792b77586.png relnofollowI tried drawing linesa, but it looks more like some drawing by a 5 year old...p  pIn case youre interested about the circles in the middle, osu has a gameplay element called spinner  that should explain everything .p  pI also thought of doing a Heatmap  created a double array of my screen pixel dimensions and tried to fill it with values representing heat, but due to how mouse events are processed, this generates points and not lines. And filling in the lines, considering that there are around 50000 points per visualization  generating heat data based on these lines, seems to be a gigantic task that a standard desktop PC cannot handle.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 9581 pCurrently, when editing HTML files, I preview them using the following mapping codennoremap cc w ltCRgt open a ApplicationsGoogle Chrome.app ltCRgtltCRgtcode.

Negative 9581 pI have in the bottom of the screen a view containing 4 image views that I use as navigation buttons. That view is pinned to bottom layer by 0. Now my tableview is above this view and I have made a constraint of 10 from tableview to my navigation view. I have two problems. When my tableview contains more rows than the screen can hold it puts the cells  behind my navigation view even though I made the constraint it shouldnt. Now when I flip the screen to landscape mode it actually makes my navigation view disappear from the screen. I dont understand why as I pinned the bottom view to bottom layer. 2 questions Then of course my 2nd row decides to use much bigger font when I load in more rows, which is something I dont even want to bother you guys with yet, I think my simulator is playing tricks with me..p  pAnyway, I appreciate any help on my 2 problems above. Thank youp  pEDIT Here I took some pictures  a hrefhttpi.imgur.comLA9Spt0.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comLA9Spt0.pnga this shows what i mean with the tableview pushing away the lower view even though the lower view is constrained to the bottom layer and the tableview has a constrain leading to the lower view menu barp  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.comb6VoqFk.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comb6VoqFk.pnga Here what happens when I pull the tableview downwards to see  more cells it blocks the upper label and top bar which contains the logo I had to remove for reasons with the company I tried to use setBounces and setAlwaysVertBounces set to NO but then I cant scroll down the tableview when more cells exist.p  paddition to img. nr 2multiple cells makes the cells hide behind the lower menu navigation bar. I did make a constrain between the tableview and lower menu bar, shouldnt I be able to make the tableview create a scroll bar so u can scroll down instead of cells hiding behind the menu bar.p  pThanks, any help much appreciatedp

However this is also looks like a lot of work and is probably more easy said than done, hence Im not sure if this is a feasible option.empli ol  pObviously none of the three options are really satisfying and I wonder if Im missing something obvious here, hence the reason for my question. Is there any reasonable way regarding security, portability and amount of work needed to implement this functionallity.p

Negative 9581 pHeres the short version. First and foremost I want my class to be immutable. I know that a class cant be both abstract and final. strongWhat Im asking is is there a way to emonlyem allow inner classes to extend and implement the outer, abstract classstrong This may not be the best method to achieve my immutable goals, so if somebody has a better design, I would love to hear it.p  pI am writing a class for vector operations  as in physics and engineering, not the programming sense. Im also aware that a hrefhttpjscience.orgapiorgjsciencemathematicsvectorpackagesummary.htmlJScience has a packagea for this kind of stuff.

Negative 9581 pI have a solution with two projectsp  ul liProject A, a large private projectli liProject B, a small public project which needs a subset of the functions from Ali ul  pIm just getting started on Project B, but I already have a Project A which handles many things that will be needed in the new one. I would obviously like to reuse these functions without copying them. p  pIf I add these as a reference in Visual Studio 2012 everything works code wise for Project B, but the generated assembly directory will also contain a functioning copy of Project A.exe. p  pI need to include my code from Project A without having a compiled .exe file in my output directory. Either by having it as a .dll file or inlined into the main assembly without having to refactor out the relevant parts of Project A into a new class library project. Is this possiblep  pThanks for your timep

I was expecting therefore to find 90px vertical distance between them, but only have 50px.p  pI understand that the strongmargins are collapsingstrong, and that if I want to fix this then I need to add codedisplay inlineblockcode to the pre tag. But that causes the width of the pre tag to collapse. p  pAgain, I know that I can fix the width problem by adding codewidth 100code to my pre tag, but Ive got padding on the pre tag 20px, so this causes my elements to be too wide. I know that I can use strongboxsizingstrong to deal with that, but what an almightly pain in the crotch it is to have to mess about with width, display and boxsizing just to have the desired amount of vertical space between two elements. So I simply refuse to do any of that.p  pInstead, Ive decided that Im just going to add codemargintop 90pxcode to my pre tag, which will guarantee that Ive got the strong90pxstrong space that I want. p  pMy question is strongAre there any browsers out there that dont collapse margins in the way the others dostrong Will I inadvertently end up with 140px space 90px from the topmargin of the pre tag  50px from the bottom margin of the paragraph tag In other words, are margins collapsed reliably and consistently across all browsers, or is there a browser out there that does its own thingp

Negative 9581 pIve been using apigees baas recently and also looking at edge. I know that if I call my baastoken endpoint with a users name and password I can obviously get a valid access token back for a user. However this doesnt have a refresh token and the user would have to sign in again depending on what the TTL is.  Now I noticed in the apigee edge setup and oauth policies that you can get access to refresh tokens but I cant figure out how to set this up with apigee BAAS as my identity provider. Ive successfully created a new oauth proxy. First I extract the username and password from the request. I then assign these to new service callout that hits my BAAS. This successfully passes back the correct user details and a valid BAAS access token. p  pAt this point I use a standard GenerateAccessToken policyp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8 standaloneyesgt ltOAuthV2 asyncfalse continueOnErrorfalse enabledtrue nameOAuthv201gt ltDisplayNamegtOAuth v2.0 1ltDisplayNamegt ltFaultRulesgt ltPropertiesgt ltAttributesgt ltOperationgtGenerateAccessTokenltOperationgt ltExpiresIngt8640000ltExpiresIngt ltSupportedGrantTypesgt   ltGrantTypegtpasswordltGrantTypegt ltSupportedGrantTypesgt  ltGrantTypegtgranttypeltGrantTypegt ltUserNamegtusernameltUserNamegt ltPassWordgtpasswordltPassWordgt ltGenerateResponse enabledtruegt  ltOAuthV2gt codepre  pall the variables here are set correctly. But I also have to set a basic authorization header. This header is based on the base64 encoded clientid and client string associated with my app in edge. However the access token that then gets returned from here doesnt work if I try to call a BAAS endpoint Even when proxied through edge and the user details that are returned with this relate to the user associated with the clientid provided, not the user whos username and password were submitted I know I can mashup the response from my service callout, but this is more about accesstokens rather than the user data.

Negative 9581 pI am implementing a RESTful service that has a security model requiring authorization at three levelsp  ol listrongResource level authorizationstrong  determining whether the user has access to the resource entity at all.  For example, does the current user have permission to view customers in general.  If not, then everything stops there.li listrongInstance level authorizationstrong  determining whether the user has access to a specific instance of a resource entity.  Due to various rules and the state of the entity, the current user may not be granted access to one of more customers within the set of customers.  E.g., a customer may be able to view their own information but not the information of another customer.li listrongProperty level authorizationstrong  determine which properties the user has access to on an instance of the resource entity.  We have many business rules that determine whether a user may see andor change individual properties of a resource entity.  For example, the current user may be able to see the customers name but not their address or phone number as well as able to see and add notes. li ol  pImplementing resourcelevel authorization is straightforward however, the other two are not.  I believe the solution for instancelevel authorization will reveal itself with a solution to the harder, imo propertylevel authorization question.  The latter issue is complicated by the fact that I need to communicate the authorization decisions, by property, in the response message ala hypermedia  in other words, this isnt something I can simply enforce in property setters.p  pWith each request to the service, I must use the current users information to perform these authorization checks.  In the case of a GET request for either a list of resources or an individual resource, I need to tell the API layer which attributes the current user can see is visible and whether the attribute is readonly or editable.  The API layer will then use this information to create the appropriate response message.  For instance, any property that is not visible will not be included in the message.  Readonly properties will be flagged so the client application can render the property in the appropriate state for the user.p  pSolutions like application services, aspects, etc. work great for resourcelevel authorization and can even be used for instancelevel checks, but I am stuck determining how best to model my domain so the business rules and checks enforcing the security constraints are included.p  pNOTE Keep in mind that this goes way beyond rolebased security in that I am getting the final authorization result based on business rules using the current state of the resource and environment along with verifying access using the permissions granted to the current user via their roles.p  pstrongHow should I model the domain so I have enforcement of all three types of authorization checksstrong in a testable way, with DI, etcp

Negative 9581 pI have a google form that gets generic information from the user and saves it all in a sheet. When a new form is submitted, the information is appended together with a new line n command between every new piece of information, and is sent to an email using the Mailapp.sendEmailemail, subject, message function. This works fine, and is formatted the way I would like it. However, when I use the Mailapp.sendEmailemail, replyEmail, subject, message function, the n commands seem to disappear from the code. They do not show up in the email and the information in the email is all grouped together in 1 line. Does anyone know why this might be happening, and how I would be able to get the formatting back Thanksp

For this I need to fetch the Backup IP address of the computer , replace the last octet by 1 and use it in the route add command. The only way I can think to identify the Backup NIC is to identify the NIC which has No Gateway Prod NIC has a Default Gateway while Backup NIC doesnt has any. Hence my first step is to identify the Static IPAddress of that NIC which has NO Gateway i.e Default Gateway part is empty however Static IP and Subnet Mask is there. Ive tried the following till now with no luckp  precodeGetWmiObject win32NetworkAdapterConfiguration Filter DefaultIPGatewayNULL  Select IPAddress codepre  pstrongERROR  GetWmiObject  Invalid Querystrongp  precodeGetWmiObject win32NetworkAdapterConfiguration Filter DefaultIPGateway  Select IPAddress codepre  pstrongERROR  GetWmiObject  Invalid Querystrongp  pAlso I tried the following code which logically came to my mindp  precodentwkGetWmiObject win32NetworkAdapterConfiguration  Select IPAddress,DefaultIPGateway forearchnet in ntwk    ifnet.DefaultIPGateway eq      WriteOutput IP of NIC with NO gateway is net.IPAddress    codepre  pstrongERROR  GetWmiObject  Invalid Querystrongp  pCan Someone please help me out as how can I achieve this Hope Im clear with my query.

Negative 9581 pI currently have two separate media extractors and codecs that I am using to break down each individual sample into codeByteBuffercodes. Then I store each sample into two codeshortcode arrays. Then I call my mix function which combines the two samples into one codeshort[]code and if I play this codeshort[]code with codeAudioTrackcode it plays the result great with both sounds playing at the same time as desired. p  pHowever, what I really want to do is use codeMediaMuxercode to convert my new codeshort[]code back to an mp4 audio file and store it to the device for later playback. Can someone please help me figure out what Im doing wrongp  pHere is some of the code I have... As you can see, I commented out the codeAudioTrackcode and that is where Im trying to turn the codeshort[]code back into the codeByteBuffercode so I can use the media muxer to create the audio file.

Negative 9581 pIm a bit stuck on this. I have a complex stack composed of middleman, karma, jasmine, babeljs to build a static website.p  pConsidering this is an experiment, I wanted to use ES6 with modules. Everything fine on middleman side, though, Im having hard times setting up karma  jasmine for testing.p  pThe main problem lies within babel if you set it to use codemodules ignorecode you have to manually use codeSystem.importcode for strongallstrong your modules in your specs, which is something I dont want. I would like to use the ES6 syntax, but if I set codemodules systemcode, babeljs wraps all my tests into codeSystem.registercode, with something like the followingp  precodeSystem.register[mymodule], function export    use strict    var Mymodule   return      setters [function mymodule        Mymodule  mymodule[default]     ],     execute function          console.logIm here       console.logMymodule        describeMymodule, function            ithas version, function             expectMymodule.VERSION.toEqual1.0.0                            codepre  pSo the tests are not automatically executed. I then created the following script to work around it which is included after all specs are includedp  precodebasePath  basespec  modules  []  for own fileName, fileHash of window.karma.files   if fileName.indexOfbasePath is 0     isRunner    fileName.indexOfspecrunner gt 0     isRunner  fileName.indexOfspechelper gt 0     unless isRunner       moduleName  fileName.replacebasePath,        moduleName  moduleName.replace.js,        modules.pushpath fileName, name moduleName  mappedModules   baseSpecsPath  httplocalhost9876  for module in modules   mappedModules[module.name]  baseSpecsPath  module.path  System.config   baseURL httplocalhost4567javascripts   map     mappedModules  for module in modules   System.importmodule.name codepre  pThis code is simple it prepares the emmapem configuration for SystemJS, I can correctly load modules from my app located in a hrefhttplocalhost4567 relnofollowhttplocalhost4567a and tests wrapped in System.register located in a hrefhttplocalhost9876 relnofollowhttplocalhost9876a.p  pHowever, my tests are not run, and strongno error reportedstrong. Even worse, I correctly get the message logged emIm hereem and Mymodule is logged in console correctly. I even tried to log the value of emdescribeem and its correctly a emSuiteem object. So, why on earth my tests are not run The codeitcode block is never runp  pWhat solutions do I have Im ok with changing the setup a bit to get it working, but I want to keep the following things Middleman, ES6 modules, strongno dynamic module loadingstrong all my modules are exposed, in the end, in a single file or required with a bunch of codeltscriptgtcode tags, jasminep

Negative 9581 pMy question, overall, is in regards to best practices and efficiency. Today, my teacher and I had a discussion about OOP  in MVC Legacy. We were going through a previous project of mine and the question is Whats the point The way my project and all my projects are structured, it doesnt make sense to me. Here is an example followed by my code.p  pstrongControllerstrong Gets the String values from the formView and passes them to the Service class. Single Responsibility would state that this is all it is responsible for, not creating an object to pass, but creating a lt Map lt String,Object  would be totally fine from my understanding.p  pstrongService Classstrong Following best practicessingle responsibility these methods are not supposed to do anything other than call the requested methodpass values.p  pstrongDAOstrong The DAO is supposed to be responsible for transferring all dataobjects into usable form for the D.B accessor and to return them as such. p  pBut why build an object just to tear it down Especially when you could just pass a list of values down as a  Maplt String,Object  so all the values and columns match upp  pThe following are code snippets to help illustrate my questionp  pstrongService Classstrongp  precode public class ClientService         private ClientSQLDAOStrategy dao        public ClientServiceClientSQLDAOStrategy dao            setDaoStrategydao               public void sendClientToStorageClient client throws SQLException, ClassNotFoundException         dao.sendClientToDatabaseclient               public void updateClientList values throws SQLException, ClassNotFoundException         dao.updateClientvalues          codepre  pstrongDAOstrongp  precode public void saveClientClient client throws ClassNotFoundException, SQLException       List columns  new ArrayListltgt     columns.addLastName     columns.addFirstName     columns.addBusinessName     columns.addPhone      ListltObjectgt values  new ArrayListltgt     values.addclient.getClientLastName     values.addclient.getClientFirstName     values.addclient.getClientBusiness     values.addclient.getClientPhone      accessor.createRecordTABLENAME, columns, values   public void updateClientList listOfValues throws ClassNotFoundException, SQLException      ListltObjectgt columns  new ArrayListltgt     columns.addLastName     columns.addFirstName     columns.addBusinessName     columns.addPhone      int primaryKey  Integer.valueOflistOfValues.get0.toString          accessor.updateRecordTABLENAME, columns, listOfValues, PKCOLUMN, primaryKey   codepre  pComparing the two methods provided in the DAO which approach makes more sense Creating the Client to tear it down or passing associated values and columns to the accessor This  Maplt String,Object  seems ideal for both methods.p  pAnd yes, Im aware of the newer techniques as well, but at the current time in the semester Legacy is the lesson of the week.p
