Positive 2419 pI have a PivotTable in Excel but no access to the raw data which I would like to export so I can analyse it further. The easiest solution would be to have access to the raw data that is used to create the PivotTable, but in my case this is not possible as customised software is pulling the data from a database to which I have no access. I only have the Excel PivotTable and I need to export it somehow. p  pIs there a way to directly export the Excel PivotTable to XMLp

And I have to return my results as List lt List lt Object.p  pI am having trouble with MAXMIN I am assuming that AVERAGE will be similar to MAX and MINp  pIn order to pivot on multiple table values, I created a class to using my my second groupingByp  pThis will not compile, I am not sure what to Compare against, where to convert the object to int or if I even need to.

Negative 2419 pLets say that I have an application running on Windows XP that is launched from a mapped network drive.  When a page fault is triggered by the execution of this application and a code page needs to be read from disk, assuming its not in the pagefile, will Windows go out to the mapped network share to read the necessary code page in from disk or will it make a copy of it locally when its first executed  I realize there are different types of page faults but Im specifically asking about the case where the code must be read from the file on disk.  In this case, since the applications image exists on a remote share Im assuming the page fault handler must go out to the network share to retrieve the code page.  Is this correctp  pI have an application thats running in this manner and periodically it seems to hang the system but the system becomes responsive after a short period of time, sometimes just a few seconds and in other cases 1015 minutes.  This system also has a lot of AV and DLP products installed on it and thus several TDI filter drivers and file system filter drivers which seemingly would add to the latency in processing the page fault especially if the code must be paged in from a process image that exists on a remote share.p  pIve been reading through Windows Internals and it discusses page fault handling but I dont see any mention of the case when dealing with a remote mapped drive.  Im assuming its got to go out to the network share to retrieve the necessary code page but I just want to be sure Im right.  If anyone has any other recommended reading Id love to hear it.  Ive currently got a kernel debugger attached to a problematic system so I can catch it in the act but, of course, since Ive attached the kernel debugger and have had it running for 2 days Ive yet to see the problem occur again.p  pThanks in advance for any helpadvicep

Negative 2419 pI know that if IP payload  MTU then routers usually fragment the IP packet. Finally all the fragmented packets are assembled at the destination using the fields IPID, IP fragment offsets and fragmentation flags. Max length of IP payload is 64K. Thus its very plausible for L4 to hand over payload which is 64K. If the L2 protocol is Ethernet, which often is the case, then the MTU will be about 1600 bytes. Hence IP packet will be fragmented at the source host itself. However, a quick search about IP implementation in Linux tells me that in recent kernels, L4 protocols are fragment friendly i.e. they emtryem to save the fragmentation work for IP by handing over buffers of size which is close to MTU.p  pConsidering these two facts, I am wondering about how frequently does the IP packet gets fragmented at the source host itself.  Does it occur sometimesrarelynever Does anyone know if there are exceptions to the rule of fragmentation in linux kernel i.e. are there situations where L4 protocols are not fragment friendly How is this handled in other common OSes like windows In general how frequently IP packets are fragmentedp

Negative 2419 pI am running Spring  hibernate 3  c3p0. Upon start up, if the database is down an exception is thrown after about 10 mins. Until then the program is blocked... I dont include spring xml, hibernate configuration etc, since it is a fairly common problem and if a solution exists it must be a standard straighforward way. If not i can trim the crucial code and configuration and paste it here. Does anybody know anything about it  Thanks in advance.p  hr  pTo clarifyp  pWhat I essentially need is to know if there is a wrapper in c3p0 or hibernate, or even spring, around the DriverManager.setLoginTimeout function. Or a feature that offers me this functionality. The wrapper could be through a setting or something. I just want to get an exception if i havent connected to the datasource in X seconds, no matter the cause socket, database, bad weather. And I want to find a place to set this X. To make things worse, Oracle driver , which is the driver i am using, does not implement setLoginTimeout so I cant use it directly. I ve come to realize there is no way to solve it, but to manually spawn a timer thread of my own. Anybody can verify the above situation Thanks a lot.p

Negative 2419 pThe common practice in Perl is of course to end modules with code1code so that a call to require can then be checked for success.

Negative 2419 pGreetings,p  pIm working on a game project that uses a 3D variant of hexagonal tile maps. Tiles are actually cubes, not hexes, but are laid out just like hexes because a square can be turned to a cube to extrapolate from 2D to 3D, but there is no 3D version of a hex. Rather than a verbose description, here goes an example of a 4x4x4 mapp  pimg srchttpi90.photobucket.comalbumsk250dhirielhextiles.png alt titleSample mapp  pemI have highlighted an arbitrary tile green and its adjacent tiles yellow to help describe how the whole thing is supposed to work but the adjacency functions are strongnotstrong the issue, thats already solved.emp  pI have a struct type to represent tiles, and maps are represented as a 3D array of tiles wrapped in a codeMapcode class to add some utility methods, but thats not very relevant. Each tile is supposed to represent a emperfectlyem cubic space, and they are all emexactlyem the same size. Also, the offset between adjacent rows is emexactlyem half the size of a tile.p  pThats enough context my question isbr strongGiven the coordinates of two points codeAcode and codeBcode, how can I generate a list of the tiles or, rather, their coordinates that a straight line between codeAcode and codeBcode would crossstrongp  pThat would later be used for a variety of purposes, such as determining Lineofsight, charge path legality, and so on.p  pBTW, this may be useful my maps use the 0,0,0 as a reference position. The jagging of the map can be defined as offsetting each tile codeyz mod 2  tileSize2.0code to the right from the position itd have on a sane cartesian system. For the nonjagged rows, that yields 0 for rows where codeyz mod 2code is 1, it yields 0.5 tiles.p  pIm working on C4 targeting the .Net Framework 4.0 but I dont really need specific code, just the algorithm to solve the weird geometricmathematical problem. I have been trying for several days to solve this at no avail and trying to draw the whole thing on paper to visualize it didnt help either  .p  pThanks in advance for any answerp

Negative 2419 pI am using LINQ to SQL with single table inheritance for an audit log.  There is a fieldproperty called Type that i am using as the dicriminator and i have created a base type and a single inherited type there will be more later if i can actually get this to work. p  pSo that i dont have to write a different method to insert each different derived audit type the method takes the base type, but it doesnt work, it throws a codeSQLTypeExceptioncode saying that the date is out of range, despite the fact that the only date field has been set using codeDateTime.Nowcode.

Negative 2419 pbHow to define the LocalEndPoint to use by a WCF client when calling a WCF service if the client machine has multiple IP addresses bp  pI have a machine located in a DMZ with two IP addresses, the external IP address can be reached through the firewall via a VPN connection from our webserver, located at an external service provider. On this machine runs a WCF and Unitybased custom app server, which should act as proxy or application level gateway ALG. It shall accept the service calls from the web server and uses a wcf client factory to regenerate the service calls, forwarding them to the real app server in the LAN.p  pWhen recreating the service calls on this proxy using a wcf client factory, the wcf client should use the second, internal IP address of this machine, because only messages coming from this internal IP address will be allowed to pass the firewall to reach the app server in the LAN. Unfortunately our wcf client proxies always choose to create the outgoing messages using the first, external IP addresses. I am looking for a way to explicitly setting the IP address to use by the wcf client proxies.p  pI could find only one WCF binding element that allows the definition of a LocalEndPoint or ClientBaseAddress CompositeDuplexBindingElement. As far as I understand from the documentation this property is meant to tell the server where to send the asynch reply messages, so its a different setting than what I am looking for.p  pAny Idea what I can do to come to a workable solutionp  pbThanks in advance for any helpful advicebp  pThis seems to be a similar question, just using TcpClientSockets instead of WCF a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2016012specifytheoutgoingipaddresstousewithtcpclientsocketinchttpstackoverflow.comquestions2016012specifytheoutgoingipaddresstousewithtcpclientsocketincap  pAnd another one, this time regarding a SoapClient a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions321788cbindinganewsoapclienttoaspecificipaddressbeforesendingoutgoingreqhttpstackoverflow.comquestions321788cbindinganewsoapclienttoaspecificipaddressbeforesendingoutgoingreqap

Long story short, RockYou is a service that allows users to create personalized MySpace widgets. The service was hacked, and the hacker released a giant text file of all of the plain text passwords, without any user information, to the public over a torrent.p  pI have imported all of the passwords into MySql, and I now have a giant table with 17004335 password records. Id like to reform the data so I can quickly get the percentile of any provided password as well as the number of times the password occurs in the data set.p  pHeres what my current password table looks likep  precodepassword password1 password2 password3 password1 password3 password3 codepre  pId like to turn it into a simplified table that is ordered by occurrences descending. Also, I need some help correctly identifying what percentile any given password is in. Would strongpassword3strong be in the 100 percentile and strongpassword1strong be in the 33 percentilep  precodepassword    occurrences    percentile password3   3               password1   2               password2   1               codepre  pIm going to use this data to make a tool that will allow users to quickly see if a password occurs in the data set. The higher the percentile, the more insecure the password. Obviously, if the password is even in the data set that is a bad thing. ]p  pAny help with SQL queries to get this data reformed would be much appreciated.p

Negative 2419 pIm quite new to mercurial, Ive read a lot of topics on this subject but I still cant understand if I can achieve what Im trying to do.p  pBasically Id be interested in cloning the current revision of a branch from a main repository and its subrepos in a single command acting on the main repo.

Id like to have each module in its own repository, and a master repo the one that has the .hgsub as a glue to keep all the subrepos in place.

There are several arrayControllers in my application so I want to be able to specify which one I want to obtain the super of by code.p  pThe reason I am looking for the super of an NSArrayController is because I am under the impression that one should address the model rather than the controller NSArrayController and my model is a Core Data model that I believe I could get to by using the super of an NSArrayController I specify by name. Perhaps there is a more direct way of adding to the data model.p

Negative 2419 pWe have recently been transitioning our company mapping system from Google map, first to deCarta and then to OpenLayers. We have found that OpenLayers and deCarta are remarkably slower than Google Maps when many elements several thousand are added to the map pins with bubbles on click. Google has the Marker Manager which appears to make it faster, but what I cant figure out is how this cuts down the memory usage or whatever to make it perform so much better. Its driving me nuts because we do the same thing with both OL and deCarta as we do with Google and the others are so slow. Does anyone have any experience in working with these systemsp  pI know that Google is the massive giant of mapping technology and therefore has put enormous amounts of money into the system, so its not surprising that its faster.

Negative 2419 pI am writing an iPhone app that uses Facebook extensively.  Right now, Im getting the access token using the iPhone Facebook SDK.  This returns me a standard access token.  p  pIm sending this token serverside and using it for many queries successfully.  However, there are some queries that require an access token signed with the Application Secret, which the iPhone app sdk cant do clientside due to security vulnerabilities specifically Im trying to use dashboard methods.  p  pSo my question is is there some way I can have Facebook upgrade this iPhone access token serverside to contain the signed secret  Or do I have to validate serverside from the beginning to do this  p  pThe docs say that with the Serverside flow method, once the user allows your app, you get a code generated by the server that you must send back with your App Secret to get your access token.  The iPhone SDK uses Clientside flow method, and it seems to skip this step, so Im not sure how to get this code.  So I guess the question boils down to, is it possible to upgrade a token gotten with the client side flow method to one that can be used fully server side.p

Negative 2419 pWe are attempting to port a legacy application from an old monolithic RTOS to a unix based RTOS on a PowerPC 8360. In the old system, our large code base became dependent upon 10 returning zero, and 00 returning zero. Now in the new operating system 10 returns inf and 00 returns NaN, which breaks our application. Weve tried playing around with the FPSCR register with no results. p  pSecondly, if there is a way to change it, can the change take affect for our application process and not the entire system We do not want to change the div0 behavior of other applications within the system.p  pAnticipating the inevitable why are you doing it that way question, we have to preserve the previous behavior so changing the app to actually not divide by zero is out of the question. This is a sore spot with us so please refrain from asking. Thanks in advancep

Negative 2419 pAnalyzing a WCF client application that I did not write and still do not know too much about that talks to a bunch of services via SOAP and after running for a couple of days will throw an OutOfMemoryException, I found out that .nets PooledBufferManager will never ever release unused buffers, even when the app runs out of memory, leading to OOMEs.p  pThis of course being in accordance with the spec a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms405814.aspxhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms405814.aspxap  blockquote   pThe pool and its buffers are [...] destroyed when the buffer pool is   reclaimed by garbage collection.p blockquote  pPlease feel free to answer to only a single of the questions below, as I have a bunch of questions, some of a more general nature, and some specific to our apps use of the BufferManager.p  pFirst a couple of general questions about the default PooledBufferManagerp  pstrong1strong In a environment where we have GC, why would we need a BufferManager that will hold on to unused memory, even when that leads to OOME I know, there is BufferManager.Clear, which you can use to emmanuallyem get rid off all buffers  if you have access to the BufferManager, that is. See further down for why I dont seem to have access.p  pstrong2strong Despite of MS claim that This process is much faster than creating and destroying a buffer every time you need to use one., shouldnt they leave that up to the GC and its LOH for example and optimize the GC insteadp  pstrong3strong When doing a BufferManager.Take33  1024  1024, I will get a buffer of 64M, as the PooledBufferManager will cache that buffer for later reuse, which might  well, in my case it isnt and therefore its pure waste of memory  be that, say, 34M, or 50M, or 64M, are needed. So was it wise to create a potentially very wasteful BufferManager like this, that is used by default, I assume by HttpsChannelFactory Im failing to see how the performance for memory allocation should matter, especially when we are talking about WCF and network services that the application will talk to every 10 seconds TOPS, normally many more seconds or even minutes.p  pNow some more specific questions related to our applications use of BufferManagers. The app connects to a couple of different WCF services. For each of them we maintain a connection pool for the http connections, as connections may occur concurrently.p  pInspecting the single biggest object in one heap dump, a 64M byte array that had only been used once in our app at initialization time and is not needed afterwards, as the response from the service is that big only at initialization time, which btw. is typical for many applications I have used, even though that could be subject to opimization caching to disk etc..

Negative 2419 pIs there a way to queue some executable task i.e. HTTP request to be executed once a network connection is available, given that the app is suspended by the time network connectivity is reestablishedp  pA typical scenario would bep  pA user, on a train, opens an app. They modify some state within the app which has then got to be transmitted to some server. The user then closessuspends the app. Unfortunately during the time the app was active the iphone had no signal and only regained that signal at the next train station. At this point, of reestablished connection, I would like to have some task be awakened so that it can attempt to perform the transmission of modified state to the server.p  pIs this possible I would also be happy if the task could only be implemented as some kind of cron  scheduled task where the task could check for connectivity and attempt a transmission periodically.p

Negative 2419 pTrying to write a UDP clientserver application using Swing. Each instance of the client should be able to send messages to the Server from the event dispatch thread and also continuously listen for messages from other clients relayed through the server on a worker thread using SwingWorker. Im trying to implement a ListenWorker class now whose doInBackground method will continuously listen for UDP datagrams, and publish the data to the process method, with will update a JTextArea on the client JFrame with the message. However, Im running into some difficulties due to my inexperience with SwingWorker and general Swing concurrency.

As far as I can see, I want my doInBackground to be a void method, since I intend it to run indefinitely, listening for datagrams from the various clients. Java doesnt seem to want to let me have it as a void method though. How would I code a way around thisp

Negative 2419 pI have seemed to get myself in an Oracle bind again.p  pI have some Oracle SQL that works  postable on request, that will be a base query for a bunch of other queries.  So I guess this would be preferably a view with parameters that other views could join to.  However I have learned that that is not possible.  The results will eventually be used in SSRS.  My main hurdle is that I would like to have a parameter passed to the query which is used twice in the existing SQL.  Ive tried packages only to be stuck with what to do the the cursor when trying to query against other tables and getting results usable in SSRS.  Ive also attemted variables and I forgot what all else.   In MSSQL I would just create a stored procudure but as I am learning there are more differences than similarities because Oracle seems to have more flexibility and power for those who know how to use it.  Im sure I could figure it out eventually, but right now my head hurts from banging it on the desk to much.  p  pThanks for helping. Paulp

Negative 2419 pIn a worker thread, I iterate over a list of items that need updating. In the main thread, the user often calls a function to add elements to that list. Im using a mutex to prevent the list from being modified while its being iterated. Generally, the pseudocode looks like thisp  precode called by the client to add an element. void AddElementToListelement       lock mutex      add element to the list      unlock mutex    this function is run by the worker thread void WorkerThreadUpdate       lock mutex      for each element in the list          update the element          mark the element for deletion if finished      for every finished element          remove element from list      unlock mutex  codepre  pThe problem comes when updating the element. The elements update function can potentially take a long time, up to about one second in some cases. When this occurs, the users next call to AddElementToList blocks, causing their application to freeze until all the element have been updated. The AddElementToList function is called often enough for this to be a very noticable problem. p  pSo Im looking for a better method. I want to update the elements while protecting the list but keep the users main thread responsive. Im sure this is pretty much multithreading 101, but I cant come up with the correct terms to find examples of what Im looking for.p  pI was thinking of a solution that uses two lists, a request list and a work list. p  pThe user calls AddElementToList which adds the element to the request list. In the worker thread, after the work list has been iterated, it goes through the request list and adds its elements to the work list for the next frame. It only locks when it actually modifies the lists.p  precode called by the client to add an element. void AddElementToListelement       lock mutex      add element to the request list      unlock mutex    this function is run by the worker thread void WorkerThreadUpdate       for each element in the work list          update the element          mark the element for deletion if finished       for every finished element          lock mutex          remove element from work list          unlock mutex       lock mutex      for every element in the request list          add element to the work list      clear the request list      unlock mutex  codepre  pI think this should work, but Im not entirely sure.

Negative 2419 pIn MPI, is it possible to immediately throw out received data without allocating a buffer to hold it Im using MPIAllgather to collect data from several processes, but at some point, one or more processes have no useful data to send.p  pMy original solution was to let the useless process finish.

Negative 2419 pwe are currently planning a rails 3.2.2 application where we use RabbitMQ. We would like to run several kind of workers and several instances of a worker to process messages from different queues. The workers are written in ruby and are laying in the lib directory of the rails app.p  pSome of the workers needs the rails framework active record, active model... and some of them dont. The first worker should be called every minute to check if updates are available. The other workers should process the messages from their queues when messages which are send by the first worker are present and do some time consuming stuff with it.p  pSo far, so good. My problem is, that I only have little experiences with messaging systems like RabbitMQ and no experiences with the rails interaction between them. So Im wondering what the best practices are to get the two playing with each other. Here are my requirements againp  ul liRails 3.2.2 appli liRabbitMQli liSeveral kind of workersli liSeveral instances of one workerli liControl the amount of workers out of railsli liWorkers are doing time consuming tasks, so they have to be asyncli liOnly a few workers needs the rails framework. The others are just ruby files with some dependencies like Net or Fileli ul  pI was looking for some solution and came up with two possibilitiesp  pstrongUsing amqp with EventMachine in a new threadstrongp  pOf course, I dont want my rails app to be blocked when a new worker is created. The worker should run in another thread and do its work asynchronously. And furthermore, it should not start a new instance of my rails application. It should only require the things the worker needs.p  pBut in some articles they say that there are some issues with Passenger. And another fact that I dont like is, that we are using webbrick for development and we ought to include workarounds for that too. It would be possible to switch to another webserver like thin, but I dont have any experience with that either.p  pstrongUsing some kind of daemonizingstrongp  pMaybe its possible to run workers as a daemon, but I dont know how much overhead this would come up with, or how I can control the amount of workers.p  pHope someone can advise a good solution for that and I hope I made myself clear p

Negative 2419 pI am currently running a Solr clientserver pair which is working fine.p  pHowever, in some cases the filter query codefqcode parameter which is sent to Solr is quite large can be thousands of characters and can not be trimmed down. As the query parsing takes a hrefhttpmailarchives.apache.orgmodmboxlucenesolruser201204.mbox3CCAN4YXvfMJYKR2gajY1x6CutvQx5k9r90LXS1bgPmVD73DpjBA40mail.gmail.com3Eonly a fraction of the overall timea, I want to experiment with zipping this query part and sending it to Solr. p  pI was thinking of modifying the client so instead of codefqcode it uses another parameter e.g. codezfqcode. Solr can then decide  if it receives codezfqcode, it uses it and decodes the data into codefqcode. Otherwise it should behave as usual.p  pWhat is the standard way to achieve the above Looks like there is codeSearchHandlercode, coderequestHandlercode, codeltqueryParsercode both in solrconfig.xml and many others and Im not quite sure whats least intrusive. Im fairly confident with LuceneTomcat but dont know much about Solr data structures.p

Negative 2419 pSo, Im currently implementing the overlapsave method of block convolution in matlab, and having some trouble doing so.p  pMy implementation is using a buffered input in order to do realtime processing of input data in vectors. The input is fed to an instance of my overlapsave class, and once the buffer is full with more input than the predefined block length greater than the filter length, input is processed in chunks size of the block length using the standard overlapsave algorithm until the length of the data in the buffer is less than the block length. Then it sits and waits for more data to come in and repeats the process.p  pNow that all seems to be working fine, but the issue is in flushing the buffer after all the input has been passed to the class. There is always less data in the buffer than the block size when the flush method is called, and Im having trouble processing the remainder of the data. p  pIt should also be worth noting that after the class processes normal data, it keeps the last N1 where N is the filter length data points from the input in the buffer to uphold the overlap portion of the algorithm for subsequent data or the final flush.p  pMy question I guess is how should I process the remaining data in the buffer when flush is called I tried simply zeropadding and convolving it with the filter, but that produces garbage output... Any suggestionsp  pNote the output of flush should be appended to the output of processing the normal data blocks and this new output should match the output of convinput, filter in matlab.p

Negative 2419 pFollowing up with the post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7969865canafnetworkingreturndatasynchronouslyinsideablockCan AFNetworking return data synchronously inside a blockap  pOne of the comments in that post wasp  blockquote   pThe trick to asynchronous programming is to break the procedural,   synchronous assumption that data is there when you ask for it.   Instead, with async, when you ask for something, you give it a   callback to perform when the data finally is ready. In this case, you   would call the block in the success block of the JSON operation.   Rather than the method returning data, its told what to do when the   data is finished downloaded.p blockquote  pAlthough Im using GCD and asynchronous downloading on iOS, I do not really understand how to implement this procedural break when programming with async.p  pFor example, assume I need to download some JSON data, which includes lots of data including an image URL. I will have to download the actual image afterwards.p  pEach cell in the table takes in the data from the JSONimages downloaded. How would I implement this procedural break in this casep

Negative 2419 pI have an ASP.NET Web Form C that users fill out, it has a couple of drop down lists that cause post backs and some validation that causes post backs. I also use a couple of different update panels. One panel is visible for user input and the other panel appears after the user clicks submit and the data is added to the database. The confirmation panel the last panel also displays a confirmation number to the user.p  pAfter the last panel displays, I would like to prevent the page from reloading when the user presses F5 or refresh. The reason is, I dont want the user to accidentally click refresh or F5 and lose the confirmation number and message. When the user presses F5, the browser interprets it as wanting to load a new page and at that point the session is cleared as indicated in code below.p  pMy first thought was to reprint the message and confirmation number and make sure that the panel holding it stayed visible. I was going to do this in the else section of the code below  but since there are multiple postbacks and they all trigger the page load, that doesnt work, unless there is someway to determine if the postback is the result of a form element or the f5 key.p  precodeprotected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e              try                      if IsPostBack                              Session.Clear                 GetList                               catch Exception ex                      Do something               codepre  pIve seen a few different posts that recommend using Javascript, but I am avoiding that if possible, in the remote chance that someone has javascript turned off.p  pHere is the flow of the program User opens form, fills in fields in the contactpanel and the clicks submit.

Negative 2419 pI am using messagebox for a simple yesno question but that question should not be avoided so I want to make it unavoidable and it seems if I have one question box.p  precodemessagebox.askyesnotext, question codepre  pThen I can go back to the root window of tkinter with the question still waitng for response, but if I havep  precodemessagebox.askyesnotext, question messagebox.askyesnotext, question codepre  pWith the first messagebox open I can still go back to the root window of tkinter but with the other questionbox I am unable to  like I need. This applies to every messagebox I tested. Can anybody explain me why that is and how can I make the first question box unavoidable or I just have to do a blank codemessageboxcode before my actual question box. Is there anything I am doing wrong, because I think message box should not care if there has been a message box before it. p  pTo illustrate my point better, I started to put together a simple nicely organised example, and it worked perfectly. I figured out what were the differences, as I started to use codemessageboxcode for the first time, I wanted to test its capabilities, and did not put it in a function. In a function it works perfectly.p

Negative 2419 pSince it does not seem to be possible to queryinspect the underlying ZeroMQ queuesbuffers  sockets to see how much they are utilized, is there some way to detect when a message is dropped due to full buffers in a Publisher socket when sentqueuedp  pFor example, if the publisher queue is full, the codezmqsendcode operation will simply drop the message.p  pBasically, what I want to achieve is a way to detect situations where the queues are getting stressed andor full to be able to later on tune the solution to work better. One alternative way would be to add a sequence number to each message and do a simple calculation in the subscriber but I can never be sure that a message was lost due to full buffers in the publisher.p

Negative 2419 pHello Fellow Stack Over Flow Geniuses.  I hope I have what i hope is a simple question.  I am creating a packaged app and have access to data that I do not need to necessarily parse with JavaScript but would like to re represent the data in a new way from a very plain Jane view. To something more acceptablep  pSo my question isp  pis it possible to access the dom of Web View Chromes packaged app answer to Iframe  with java script or jquery or Angular and manipulate just the look and feel of the data being projected in that IFrame Web View  p  pAny sample code would greatly be appreciated.p  pIf the above question does not make sense I have provided a more elaborate explanation here  Ignore If You Dont Care Why I Am Setting It Up This Way p  pI have a page that uses ajax to update a list of information dynamically for some internal systems. Each system essentially just spits out data in no organized fashion. The information supplied is very... well... how do I put it.... bland haha.  The goal is to one remove this from the browser side view so another tab is not open while keeping the functionality and integrity of the data intact server side.  I need for my team specifically to be able to accessmanipulate the view of data locally only and provide essentially a easier view of the data being provided and manipulate another way. This is to ensure data can be reformatted per department without affecting everyones view of the data as everyone uses it differently.  p  pI have done ajax pulls and have parsed data and requires many calls to be made to refresh the data where this is already being done server side. I feel it would be easier to just load the page live through the web form and manipulate the data from there to display how and where I want it.p  pAny recommendations on how to easily accomplish this task would also be greatly appreciated as well.  p

Negative 2419 pI have read several tutorials about skeletal animation in OpenGL, they all seem to be single minded in using quaternions for rotation, 3d vector for translation, so not matrices.p  pBut when they come to the vertex skinning process, they combine all of the quaternions and 3d vectors into a 4x4 matrix and upload the matrices to do the rest of calculations in shaders. 4x4 matrices have 16 elements while quaternion  3d vector has only 7. So why are we converting these to 4x4 matrices before uploading p
Negative 2419 pIm working on a fluid simulation in C.  Each cycle I need to calculate the velocity of the fluid at discrete points in space.  As part of that calculation, I need a few tens of kilobytes for scratch space to hold some double[] arrays the exact size of the arrays depends on some input data.  The arrays are only needed for the duration of the method that uses them, and there are a few different methods that needs scratch space like this.p  pAs I see it, there are a few different solutions for constructing the scratch arraysp  ol lipUse new to grab memory from the heap every time the method is called.  This is what I was doing at first, however it puts a lot of pressure on the garbage collector, and the fewms spikes once or twice a second are really annoying.pli lipHave the scratch arrays passed as parameters when calling the methods.  Problem is that this forces the user to manage them, including sizing them appropriately, which is a huge pain.  And it makes using more or less scratch memory difficult since it changes the API.pli lipUse stackalloc in an unsafe context to allocate the scratch memory from the program stack.  This would work just fine, except Id need to compile with unsafe and constantly sprinkle unsafe blocks throughout my code, which Id like to avoid.pli lipPreallocate private arrays once when the program starts up.  This is fine except I dont necessarily know the size of the arrays I need until I can look at some of the input data.  And it gets really messy since you cant limit the scope of these private variables to just a single method, so theyre constantly polluting the namespace.  And it scales poorly as the number of methods that need scratch memory increases, since Im allocating a lot of memory thats only used a fraction of the time.pli lipCreate some kind of central pool, and allocate scratch memory arrays from the pool.  The main problem with this is that I dont see an easy way to allocate dynamically sized arrays from a central pool.  I could use a starting offset and length and have all the scratch memory essentially share a single large array, but I have a lot of existing code that assumes double[]s.  And Id have to be careful to make such a pool thread safe.pli ol  p...p  pDoes anyone have any experience with a similar problem  Any advicelessons to offer from the experiencep

Negative 2419 pI am using ctypes to interface python code with a legacy C DLL. The DLL expects that I give it a function pointer to be used as a callback, that then will be called from within the DLL.p  pThe C declaration of that callback looks likep  precodechar foochar buf codepre  pSemantically the DLL expects that I let point buf to a string buffer that is managed by the callback and return 0 if everything works fine. In C that would be a static char[] variable mybuf and I would pass the address of that static buf back with code like p  precodebuf  ampmybuf[0]  return char0  codepre  pThe string in mybuf needs to be null terminated as usual in C. I was able to pass a function pointer to the DLL and now a python member functionp  precodedef pyfooself, charptrptr  codepre  pgets called.p  pThe class in which pyfoo is defined also initialises in stronginitstrong a fieldp  precodeself.responsecreatestringbufferThe Response String codepre  pHow do I pass the address, where this string is actually stored in memory to the DLL Since ctypes sometimes creates copies instead of returning a real reference by address I tried something likep  precodecpointer  cint.fromaddresscharptrptr[0] cpointer.value  addressofself.response return cchar0 codepre  pIt does not work.

Negative 2419 pI have written this code self contained which throws an NPE that has me confounded.  It involves a 2D array of codeRaycode objects used in a model.  The codeRaycode objects are initialized and set to the model. When they are required outside the model, the code calls codemodel.getRayscode.  At that point the code iterates the 2D array amp logs each object, because..  A mere 23 lines after the code calls codegetRayscode, the first element of the 2D array is codenullcodep  pThere are no threads happening that might interfere with the objects in the array, so I am

Negative 2419 pLets say I have two entities, codeAcode and codeBcode. My goal is to implement the search by all properties of codeAcode and just one property of codeBcode, and to display sum of search results in one codetableViewcode. Naturally I can set codefetchRequestcode only by one entity. But if I am understand right I can fetch not only from codeAcode but from codeBcode too if they are connected with relationships. So what do I need to do to implement this Does default fetch fetches all properties from codeAcode and codeBcode If not, how can I specify fetch of all properties from codeAcode and one property of codeBcode in one fetchp

But for some odd reason the exact same code does not work when I run my game as a Windows 8 Metro App. Whats even weirder is, the code works when I run the same project on my Surface but when I run it on my PC the bullets just go straight through the enemy. I dont think posting the code would be of any use since the code is identical where ever I use it and KNOW for a fact it works. If anyone knows how this is even possible please let me know. If you want me to post the code then let me know.p  pIll explain a bit of what the code is doingp  ul liLoops through all the players bullets ul liLoops through all the enemies ul liIf rectangle collision takes place ul liIf per pixel collision takes place ul liKill enemy, remove bullet etc.li ulli ulli ulli ulli ul  pThe game runs fine as an XNA game on my PC which is the same PC I use to test it as a metro app.p

Negative 2419 pWe are having problems in synchronizing our PO files with Pootlep  ol lipLost translations The first problem we encountered was that of lost translations. After doing an updatestores, some of our translations would be missing in Pootle. We have tried to remedy this with using the keep option, but this had the adverse effect of not removing obsolete translations. We would like Pootle to hide obsolete translations, but not throw them away the translation is obsolete, but still valid.

Negative 2419 pI have a pandas data frame that represents time series data. I have a column called DTDate which is a date time date and a column called linecode which is the unit of observation  it happens to be a production line in a factory. I have many columns of data, but for the sake of this question lets imagine there are only threep  pworkers  the number of workers on the production line.  item  the name of item being produced on the production line. output  the amount of output for the item on the production line. p  pSome days each line only produces one item, sometimes multiple items. Therefore sometimes there is one observation per DTDatelinecode, and sometimes there are multiple observations. I need to collapse the data set into a single observation per DTDatelinecode. p  pHere is the rub  we do not yet know how we want to aggregate the data, and as such currently I just need to achieve a structure where we can try multiple aggregation methods.  When the line only produces one item, I simply need to preserve the data row as it is. When the line produces more than one item on a given DTDate I want to collapse the observations into a single observation according to the followingp  pworkers if the number of workers is equal within DTDatelinecode observations, then a single value of workers is carries forard to the collapsed set. If the number os workers is not equal then create a list object containing all the values of workers within the DTDatelinecode observations.  item a list object of the items is carried forward to the collapsed set.  output a list object of the output is carried forward to the collapsed set.p  pBy having list items in the collapsed set, I am leaving the strucutre flexible enough to allow myself to then experiment with different aggregation methods for each column as and when I am instructed to that effect. p  psofar I have grouped the data as followsp  precodeimport pandas as pd import numpy as np from pandas import DataFrame DF  DataFramemydata, columns  [DTDate, linecode,                                    workers, item, output]  DFGrouped  DF.groupby[DTDate, linecode] codepre  pNow I realise that what I am wanting to do is the followingp  precodeDFAggregated  DFGrouped.aggDTDate max, linecode  max,                                workers  myfunc1, item  myfunc2,                                output  myfunc2 codepre  pwhere myfunc1 evaluates if all values in the group of the column specified are equal and returns a single value if they are or a list of each value if they are not.p  pmyfunc2 returns a list of all the values in the group within the specified column. p  pMy issue is that I have no idead how to write those function, largely becasue I am not clear on how to iterate through the group specific indexrows. I have read the python documentation on grouby etc. but found it not very useful. I realise I should be posting more code of what Ive tried, but I am finding it hard to even get off the ground here. Any pointers would be greatly appreciated. p  pnow extending to give illustrative function codep  pIncidentall I would expect myfunc1 and myfunc2 to look something like thisp  precodedef myfunc1ColName     if lenset[DFGroup[ColName][x] for x in DFGroup.index]  1         return DFGroup[ColName].max     else             return [DFGroup[ColName][x] for x in DFGroup.index]  def myfunc2ColName     return [DFGroup[ColName][x] for x in DFGroup.index]  codepre  pas you can see I am not sure how to refer to the group index etc.p

Negative 2419 pI have been suffering with login issues on my aspx webforms application intermittently and the only way to resolve the issue is to Restart the App Pool IIS7. The symptoms were.. getting to the login page, If incorrect details were entered it says incorrect details. If correct details are entered it will just loop back to the login page.p  pI have found what causes the issue but not sure how to fix...

My activity needs 1 worker thread ListeningThread that is running in infinite loop listening, until the service is stopped AND the app also calls custom methods, that should be executed just once almost instantly.p  pSo far my vague idea is to have a service that starts working thread  the custom methods might be called in a fashion of class instance  service.customMethod.p  pI came across iBinder, is this the only solution Or is there any other way it can be donep
Negative 2419 pLong story short Ive written a program that contains an infinite loop, in which a function is run continuously, and must run as quickly as is possible.  p  pHowever, whilst this function completes in a microsecond time scale, I need to spawn another thread that will take considerably longer to run, but it must not affect the previous thread.p  pHopefully this example will help explain thingsp  precodewhile updateGUI  true  So, forever until terminated          final String tableContents  parser.readTablelocation, header         if tableContents.length  0 No table there, nothing to do          else              SwingUtilities.invokeLaternew Runnable                  Override                 public void run                      Thread.currentThread.setPriorityThread.MAXPRIORITY                     updateTable updates a JTable                      updateTabletableContents, TableModel                     TableColumnModel tcm  guiTable.getColumnModel                                             New thread is needed here      codepre  pSo what I need is for the codereadTablecode function to run an infinite number of times, however I then need to start a second thread that will also run an infinite number of times, however it will take millisecondsseconds to complete, as it has to perform some file IO and can take a bit of time to complete.p  pIve played around with extending the codeThreadcode class, and using the codeExecutors.newCacheThreadPoolcode to try spawning a new thread.  However, anything I do causes the codereadTablecode function to slow down, and results in the table not being updated correctly, as it cannot read the data fast enough.p  pChances are I need to redesign the way this loop runs, or possible just start two new threads and put the infinite looping within them instead.p  pThe reason for it being designed this way was due to the fact that once the codeupdateTablecode function runs, it returns a string that is used to update a codeJTablecode, which as far as I know, must be done on Javas Main Dispatch Thread, as that is where the GUIs table was created.p  pIf anyone has any suggestions Id greatly appreciate them.p  pThanksp

Where I keep some of my already downloaded images in there. If the app could not find the image in the memory cache, it will come look up in the file directory. If the image file existing, it will load the file locally and put the file reference in to the memory cache as well.pli lipIf The app cannot find the needed image from either memory cache or file cache, it will use a codeImageDownloadWorkercode extends codeAsyncTaskcode to kickoff a thread and download the image. However, android could only allow as many as 128 threads per app, I am thinking a way to save some threads.

The image is neither exiting in the memory cache, nor in the downloaded files folder. So the app checked the codedownloadTaskMapcode if theres already a thread downloading this file, so that it doesnt have to create a new AsyncTask to the same thing. bBUTb how I can know when this pending download task has finished or not without blocking the main thread If I do something like a waitnotify or some infinite whileloop, I was wondering this will block the UI threadp  pPointers are welcome, thank youp

Negative 2419 pIm working on a lab assignment and Im a bit stuck on how to implement a specific class. My task is to create a program that simulates Trolls crossing a bridge. The Trolls are represented by threads. This is part of the Troll class Ive writtenp  precodepublic class Troll implements Runnable   instance variables   constructor      public void run          System.out.println name   has arrived at the bridge.         System.out.println name   is starting to cross.           simulate crossing time         for int i  1 i lt crossingTime i               try                 Thread.sleep 1000                            catch InterruptedException e               System.out.println t  name     i   seconds.                   System.out.println name   leaves at   destination  .        codepre  pNow the part Im stuck on is my Bridge class. The Bridge class is suppose to ensure only 1 Troll crosses the bridge at a time. The bridge class must only have these 2 methods with the same method signaturep  precoderequest permission to enter bridge public void enterBridge  notify bridge that Troll is leaving public void leaveBridge  codepre  pThe problem Im having is figuring out how to make use of these methods. The hint I got from the instructions is to use synchronize. I believe this means to use a synchronized block in codeenterBridgecode, but I dont see how this would work. The code that simulates the actual crossing is in the Trolls run method this is required by the lab. So to begin crossing, you have to exit the synchronized block. This would release the lock and then other trolls will begin crossing before the previous Troll has finished, which is not wanted.p  pI dont really see the need of the Bridge methods in the first place, since I can just put the code in my Trolls run method in a synchronized block p  precodepublic void run      System.out.println name   has arrived at the bridge.     synchronized bridge           Code from before      codepre  pThis ensures only one Trolls is crossing at a time without needing to call the Bridge class methods. So can someone tell me what the lab is getting at with the Bridge class I feel like Im overlooking something obvious or maybe Im misunderstanding how synchronize works.p

With this arrangement I wrote tests that created a New A, then a New C and assigned it to A and then two New Es and assigned them to C and then persist A.p  pI then find A and delete A and ensure that its children are removed.  This test worked with hibernate but because our service will run on WebSphere 8 we switch our JPA implementation to OpenJPA. Under OpenJPA this test fails because OpenJPA attempts to delete entries from Table C before the entries in Table B have been deleted. This throws an exception because Table B has a foreign key constraint with Table C.p  pIm hoping Ive just made a simple mistake based on improper understanding on my behalf and that OpenJPA is just exposing this.p
Negative 2419 pThis is probably a really simple problem to solve but for for some reason I just cant think of the correct solution p  pWe have a function int isPrimeint n which returns a 2 if n is prime, a 1 if n is not positive and a 0 if n isnt prime. We dont have to write any code for this function, we just assume that the code is already written so all we have to do is call this function. Using this function, we have to write a code fragment that fills up an integer array of size 10 with the first ten prime numbers. NOTE Treat 1 as a nonprime number.p  pIve attempted a solution below but I dont think its right NOTE We just have to write a code fragmentp  precodeint a[10] int n, i, result  result  isPrimen     for i  0 i lt 10 i        if result  1           a[i]  n            codepre  pI have a feeling that I will have to use two for loops, one to cycle through the numbers being checked with isPrime and another one to loop through the positions in the array as I have above. But Im not sure how it would look if I had two for loops. Any help is appreciated Thanks ahead of time.p

A shortcut to the jar on the Desktop of the server has the same effect.p  pThe program however has no issues running on nonserver computers via a shortcut. p  pI have attempted to create a .bat file to run the program and running it gives me the following error listp  precodeException in thread main java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError javafxapplicationApplication     at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1Native Method     at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClassClassLoader.java792     at java.security.SecureClassLoader.defineClassSecureClassLoader.java14 2     at java.net.URLClassLoader.defineClassURLClassLoader.java449     at java.net.URLClassLoader.access100URLClassLoader.java71     at java.net.URLClassLoader1.runURLClassLoader.java361     at java.net.URLClassLoader1.runURLClassLoader.java355     at java.security.AccessController.doPrivilegedNative Method     at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClassURLClassLoader.java354     at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClassClassLoader.java424     at sun.misc.LauncherAppClassLoader.loadClassLauncher.java308     at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClassClassLoader.java357     at sun.launcher.LauncherHelper.checkAndLoadMainLauncherHelper.java482  Caused by java.lang.ClassNotFoundException javafx.application.Application     at java.net.URLClassLoader1.runURLClassLoader.java366     at java.net.URLClassLoader1.runURLClassLoader.java355     at java.security.AccessController.doPrivilegedNative Method     at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClassURLClassLoader.java354     at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClassClassLoader.java424     at sun.misc.LauncherAppClassLoader.loadClassLauncher.java308     at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClassClassLoader.java357     ... 13 more codepre  pHowever, I have included all the jars in my .bat that the program needs, as show belowp  precodeCProgram Files x86Javajdk1.7.040binjava cp EIT ServerNetbeans  ProjectsDataManipulatorbuildclassesEIT ServerNetbeans Projects DataManipulatordistlibopencsv2.3.jarEIT ServerNetbeans Projects DataManipulatordistlibjavax.mail1.5.01EIT ServerNetbeans      ProjectsDataManipulatordistlibjavadbf0.4.0EIT ServerNetbeans  ProjectsDataManipulatordistlibcommonsnet3.3EIT ServerNetbeans  ProjectsDataManipulatordistlibcommonsio2.4CProgram Files x86Java jdk1.7.040jrelibjfxrt ads.DataManipulator  pause codepre  pIm really at a loss as to why I cant get my program to execute on the server, but can on a regular machine.

Negative 2419 pIve had a problem with editing Label in GUI so I decided to transform that label to textbox with BackColor as the background has to make it look exactly as label do, but after focusing on that textbox will blinking cursor appear. Its pretty unsightly amp the only way Ive found is to set the property Enabled to false, but I also require from that textbox to do something after doubleclick amp only one click. So if it isnt enabled control, it doesnt react to doubleclicking.p  pEssentially I want to behave that textbox as label by default until its clicked once, if it is doubleclicked, then will be performed some function only rewriting the text property of other textbox. So if it is clicked once, Id like to make the textbox look like real textbox for text insert with cursor blinking. After pushing Enter it would again transform to the fake label without cursor blinking after focus.p  pEhm, is that possible Dp  pThanksp  pP.S.

Negative 2419 pIn socket programming, I see that the server is bind to an address comprising of IP and port number. Then the steps are listen, and accept  blocking call. I am wondering why the client doesnt need to bind with its ip address and port number. In fact, it binds with the server socket address. Afterwards, the client calls the connect call to establish a connection. Later, client and server both can speak to each other. How a server can speak to the client The client has not bind with its IP address and port number. How is it possible for a server to reach clientp

Negative 2419 h2The Setup for Contexth2  pI think you can tell by my resume on Stack Overflow that I am no stranger to css and its behaviors. However, I just came across something I have not experienced before that seems completely incorrectyet Firefox 27 and Chrome 33 and IE 11 all render it the same.p  pHere is the code just two empty nested div elements is the html, which a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net9DVyv1 relnofollowcan be seen in this fiddle exampleap  pstrongCSSstrongp  precodediv      width 50     height 100px     margin 10px     border 1px solid red     position relative   div gt div      position absolute     top 0     right 0     bottom 0     left 0     bordercolor cyan  codepre  pI would have expected the codeabsolutecode positioned codedivcode to directly overlap the size of the coderelativecode parent codedivcode. I expected it would have had its positioning properties override the codewidthcode and codeheightcode and codemargincode positioning from the straight codedivcode call. I would have expected this behavior 1 because it is more specific in its selector, and 2 because it is positioned absolute and given positioning calls to all four sides.p  pAs you can see by a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net9DVyv1 relnofollowthe referenced fiddle abovea it in fact retains its width and height and seems to essentially ignore its positioning values all together. That is, I get the same positioning a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net9DVyv2 relnofollowif the positioning values are taken outa. I need to override the previously set properties like so...p  precodewidth auto height auto margin auto codepre  p...a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net9DVyv4 relnofollowto get the positioning to actually do somethinga. This appears to be standard behavior given that all the main browsers are reacting the same. I suppose I have never noticed it before because normally my sizing of a wrapping div is done by a class and thus applies only to that div, while my positioning of the absolute child is done likewise, and I dont bother to set a width and height on it.p  h2The Question Itselfh2  pstrongMy question isstrong seeking quotes and links from the W3C strongdocumentationstrong or a highly respected source, such as from one of the major browser developers that discusses strongemwhyem or emthatemstrong the codewidthcode or codeheightcode settings strongshould overridestrong a setting of codetopcode, coderightcode, codebottomcode, codeleftcode, etc. settings. a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgwikiCSSabsoluteandfixedpositioning relnofollowFrom the main page discussing absolute positioninga, all I found was that either can be used to set the widthheight, but the crux of my issue is that strongemI would expect the more specificlast in cascade to take precedence no matter which way was defining the sizingemstrong. Yet this is not happening here.p  h2A Description of the Behavior I am Seeingh2  ppjp found a hrefhttpreference.sitepoint.comcssleft relnofollowthis sitepoint referencea, statingp  blockquote   pAbsolutely positioned boxes with both right and left having a value   other than auto will effectively define the width of the element   assuming that the elements width is auto. This may result in the   element having no width at all if left and right positions occur at   the same point or perhaps overlap. If the values for left,right and   width are overconstrained and the direction property is ltr, right   will be ignored. If direction is rtl, left will be ignored. Note that   replaced elements with a width of auto will have the elements   intrinsic width substituted and the preceding rules applied.p blockquote  pThis exactly articulates the embehaviorem I am seeing. It does not address emwhyem officially it is that way. I would have expected instead that eitherp  p1 A higher specificity or equal specificity but following in cascade order setting of codewidthcode and codeheightcode whether explicitly by those properties or by the positioning properites to take precedence.p  p2 In the case of defining both at once an illogical thing to do, but...p  precodediv     position absolute    width 50    left 0    right 0  codepre  porp  precodediv     position absolute    left 0    right 0    width 50  codepre  pThat the last defining of width would supersede, so the first the positioning would win, and the second the width would win. This would be just like two definitions in the same block, like sop  precodediv     width 50    width 75  codepre  pHere, codewidth 75code wins because it is last defined for the property.p
Negative 2419 pI want to upgrade a WPF project that was created in Visual Studio 2010 to Visual Studio 2013 and I am having issues with the way validation has changed.p  pIn VS 2010, I could create a Validation.Error tag that pointed to an event handler in my C code.  Then I could trap the action and if it was added, I could show a message box with an error string that was built during validation. p  pI also used the event handler to simulate key strokes and set the focus to any control and do anything else that I needed done.p  pHowever in VS 2013, the Validation tag now wants an ErrorTemplate, and I have only found examples where they are used on a single control, not the entire user control, and they dont provide a way to use an event handler like I am doing in VS 2010.

Negative 2419 pI have an issue with an optional field in an html form. The system is to send out newsletters, and a part of the form is that you choose the groups you want to send the newsletter to through the selection of checkboxes. There is a field for additional email addresses, in case the user wants to send the email to recipients not in the groups.p  pThis field is what gives me the trouble. If there is no value entered in the field, it saves an empty register to the database, which leads to the sending process failing, since it tries to get an email address to send to. p  pSo far the solutions I have seen are to assign a NULL value to the field if empty, or to assign another default value. but this will cause problems for some of the statistics that will be displayed to the user later on.p  pIs there any way to only store the value of this field if it is not empty And to ignore it completely if it is p  pIm using php, mysql, html for this p  pThank youp  pSOLVED I could make it work by separating the storing of the emails in the additional field from the rest of the emails. Then I just put an ifemptyPOST[additional] around it, and it works fine now. p

Negative 2419 pIn C, a typedef doesnt grant you any additional type safety. You can use the the new type any place you can use the old type. Sometimes thats what I want, and sometimes it is not. Sometimes I want the compiler to warn me if I misuse my new type.p  pTo make that happen, I sometimes do something like thisp  precodetypedef struct      int value  NewType  NewType doSomethingNTNewType a, NewType b      return a.value  b.value  codepre  pCompared top  precodeint doSomethingIint a, int b      return a  b  codepre  pThat plus is just an example. Lets assume that either theres a function call overhead in both cases, or else I ask the function to be inlined in both cases.

So that I will have to separate driver and app installation as two step process.p  pI have submitted the app to Apple review team with the instructions of installing the drivers, then installing the mac app to perform the desired functionality.

Once driver components complete the necessary steps then it will call the apple script to invoke the Mac app to perform its function.p

Negative 2419 pMy application needs to work as middleware where it has got ordersin form of xml from various  customers which contains the supplier id. Once it get the order, it needs to send order request  to different suppliers in the form of xml.i am double minded about three aspects of it. Here they arep  pQuestionsp  ol lipWhat i am planning at high level is as soon as request come, put it on jms queue.Now i am not sure should i create queue for each supplier or one queue should be sufficient. I think one queue will be sufficient.  as maintaining large number of queues will be overhead.. Advantage of maintaining separate queue per supplier is message can be processed faster as there will be separate producer on each queue.pli lipBefore putting the object on queue i need to do some business validations. Also the structure of input xml i am receiving and output xml i need to send to supplier is different. For this i am planning to convert the input xml to java object then put on queue so that validation can be done with ease at consumer side. Another thought is dont convert the xml into java object, just get all elements value thru xpathxstream api and validate them and put xml string as it is on queue because. Then at consumer side convert xml to java object then to different xml format. Is there a way of doing itpli lipNow my requirement is consumer on queue process the messages on queue after every 5 hours and send the xml request to suppliers. I am planning to use quartz scheduler here which will pick the job one by one and send to corresponding supplier based on supplierId. Here is my question is if my job pick the message one by one and then send it to supplier. it will be too slow . I am planning to handle it where quartz job create ThreadPool with size of say ten threads at time which concurrently process the messages from queueSo here will be multiple consumers on queue. I think thats not valid for queue. Do i need topic here instead of queue. Is second approach is better or there is some better than thispli ol  pi am expecting a load of 50k request per hour which mean around 15 request per secondp

Negative 2419 pIm a bit new to sockets in Java but here is my questionp  pI have written a client thread class that will request to connect to a server, created by another application therefore I do not have a class made for server class.

Negative 2419 pI have a Visual Studio 2010 C project that contains files that need to be processed using an inhouse custom build tool that generates C code.  p  pI have gone through the steps to add a custom build tool for each of these files.  In the Custom Build Tool command line, use call to ensure that the custom build tool runs for all these files before compiling C code. p  pThe only problem is that the custom build tool needs to be run from the directory where the files live, not from the location of the Visual Studio solution.p  pI see a few possible options right now, and none of them is idealp  ol liChange the custom build tool command line on the first file to  cd workingdir ampamp call customtool ...  I dislike this because it is fragile  if I add a new file that is alphabetically before the first file, I have to remember that it needs this special step in the custom build step.li liCreate a batch file that changes the working directory, calls the custom build tool, and changes back.  Call this batch file from Visual Studio.li liUse start instead of call to call the custom build tool.  This comes with the downside of opening up a command shell for each file and it looks like these command shells need to be closed manually.li ol  pIs there a better option for running a custom build tool on a file from a working directoryp  pThank you.p

Negative 2419 pstrongThe problemstrongp  pI have items that have weights. The higher the weight, the greater chance they have the item will go first. I need to have a clean, simple way of doing this that is based on core java no 3rd party libs, jars, etc..p  pIve done this for 2 items, by summing the weights then randomly pick a number using Math.random within that range. Very simple. But for items greater than 2, I can either do more samples in the same range chancing misses, or I can recompute the sum of the weights of the remaining items and select again recursive approach. I think that there might be something out there can can do this fastercleaner. This code will be used over and over, so Im looking for an effective solution.p  pIn essence, its like randomized weight permutations.p  pstrongSome Examplesstrongp  ol lipcodeAcode has weight of 1, codeBcode has weight of 99. If I ran the simulation with this, I would expect to get codeBAcode 99 of the time and codeABcode 1 of the time.pli lipcodeAcode has the weight of 10, codeBcode has the weight of 10, and codeCcode has the weight of 80. If I ran simulations with this, I would expect codeCcode to be the first item in the ordering 80 of the time, in those cases, codeAcode and codeBcode would have an equal chance of being the next character.pli ol  pAny help or pointers in the right direction would be appreciated.p  pstrongExtra Detailsstrongp  pFor my particular problem, there is a small number of items with potentially large weights. Say 20 to 50 items with weights that are stored in the form of a long, where the minimum weight is at least a 1000. The number of items may increase quite a bit too, so if we can find a solution that doesnt require the items to be small, that would be preferred.p

Negative 2419 pHello Im a little rusty on my Java, so please bear with me. I have been tasked with reducing the amount of duplicated code in a research project for my Professor, so I dont think Im able to post any of the code on here. But basically I have about 20 cases of generally the same method strongtest methodstrong in different classes, and Ive been trying two different ways to solve this problem but I have run into issues with each.p  pThe first way Ive found to reduce the duplication is to remove the initial variables contained in all of the strongtest methodsstrong and place them in a separate method strongprepare methodstrong inside of a superclass and have it called into the strongtest methodstrong. Isnt the problem with this solution that all of the variables declared in the strongprepare methodstrong will remain local and be erased as soon as the method is called inside of another methodp  pThe second idea I had was to just make all of the variables fields of the superclass and have them be inherited by the subclasses. This solution almost worked except for the fact that one of the variables codeIFile importedFile  importFilefilecode  which is necessary for creating many of these variables has to have whatever it is contained in throw an Exception, which I do not believe you can do with a class. p  pI was hoping someone could point me in the right direction with one of these solutions or possibly suggest another solution I have been unable to find.p  pSomething I forgot to mention is that besides the initial variables, each test method slightly varies in how their test method is written. strongEditstrong If not for this I would have just pulled up the method into a superclass and been done with it.p  pstrongEdit Heres the test method and the parts of the superclass I am using,strongp  precode method inside of the subclass     public void test throws Exception              variables removed and placed in AbstractTest             for int i  0 i lt expectedExitNodeCount i                  if markerFields.peekFirst.equalsIgnoreCaseEXPOSEDEXIT                      expectedExitNodes.addnew CTrueExitNode                  else                      fromLine  Integer.parseIntmarkerFields.removeFirst.trim                     fromCol  Integer.parseIntmarkerFields.removeFirst.trim                     toLine  Integer.parseIntmarkerFields.removeFirst.trim                     toCol  Integer.parseIntmarkerFields.removeFirst.trim                     length  lengthast, fromLine, fromCol, toLine, toCol                     assertTruelength gt 0                     ICFlowNode expectedExit  findNodeast, ICFlowNode.class, fromLine, fromCol, length                     assertNotNullexpectedExit                     expectedExitNodes.addexpectedExit                                                additional code omitted from method                Superclass the variables have been placed in. public abstract class AbstractTestCase extends WorkTest      protected File file     protected String markerText      public AbstractTestCaseString name, VPGlt  ,  ,  gt vpg          supername, vpg           protected void prepare throws Exception          Variables used in the test method             IFile importedFile  importFilefile          project.refreshLocalIResource.DEPTHINFINITE, new NullProgressMonitor         CVPG.getInstance.ensureVPGIsUpToDate          CTranslationUnit ast  CVPG.getInstance.acquireTransientAST             ResourceUtil.getFilenameForIFileimportedFile          LinkedListltStringgt markerFields  MarkerUtil.parseMarkermarkerText          int fromLine  Integer.parseIntmarkerFields.removeFirst.trim         int fromCol  Integer.parseIntmarkerFields.removeFirst.trim         int toLine  Integer.parseIntmarkerFields.removeFirst.trim         int toCol  Integer.parseIntmarkerFields.removeFirst.trim         int length  lengthast, fromLine, fromCol, toLine, toCol         assertTruelength gt 0         IASTNode node  findNodeast, IASTNode.class, fromLine, fromCol, length         assertNotNullnode          Integer expectedExitNodeCount  Integer.parseIntmarkerFields.removeFirst.trim         SetltICFlowNodegt expectedExitNodes  new HashSetltICFlowNodegt           protected void test throws Exception         Considered making test a inherited method       codepre

Negative 2419 pI am trying to implement a set of controls that will be used by various instrument wrappersadapters in an application.  The goal of these controls is to provide functionality that all of the attached devices would use such as validating an IP address rather than having each developer writing their own as new device support is added.

The problem I am struggling to understand is how the vm from the main window can share data the validated IP address in this example with the vm of the control.

Negative 2419 pWe are envisioning a product that will have a web front end and mobile apps on multiple platforms Xamarin.  Ive already turned a breeze angular hot towel example into a web front end.  I am tasked with investigating splitting apart the breeze web client and the breeze server back end.

Negative 2419 pWhat is the best way to allow visitors to a website to download files the size of tens of gigabytes In this case it is about movie files, so they are already relatively compressed.p  pHere are some assumptionsp  ul lipOnly one visitor will want to download a file at any time and nobody other than our servers has the file at any one time.pli lipThere is a high probability that the transfer will be interrupted due to network problems or other problems, so some kind of resume should be available.pli lipThe visitor will get a download link either on the website or via email.pli lipShould work at least for visitors running Windows or OS X. It would be a bonus if it also works with some Linux distribution.pli ul  pMy experience with FTP and normal HTTP is that some visitors manage to download what they believe is the entire file but it then turns out not to be working because the file is incomplete or corrupted.p  pPrinting the md5 sum or similar on the website and asking the visitor to run md5 on the download and then compare the results is too complicated for most website visitors.p  pZipping the file adds a layer of error checking and completeness checking but often adds some manual steps for the visitor.p  pIs there some better solutionp

Negative 2419 pI am currently working on a project in which I will be creating a vertical scatter plot using on average 6 points of yaxis data using Sigmaplot. The units of the graph are depth of snow in cm vs time. However the data I have collected is gathered over a range of days i.e. 173176 and I am having trouble applying my data sets to their respective ranged abscissa. Ive noticed inputting the data in this manner finds the difference in the abscissa i.e. 173176 would correspond to 3 rather than interpreting the data as a range. Can anyone help me find a way in which to input abscissa not as singular values but rather ranges of those values using Sigmaplotp

Negative 2419 pI need to check if an XML document contains a given XML DOM subtree. I only need to ensure that all the elements and attributes from this subtree are present in the document. However, there can be more elements or attributes in the subtree of the document that matches the given subtree for comparison. And I want them to be skipped from the comparison.p  pSo far I have implemented my own solution which finds a subtree represented by Node class in the given XML document. This Node class contains only the attributes necessary for comparison  element name, text content, list of child nodes and map of attributes. I have implemented my own class and not used org.w3c.dom.Node because it is just too big containing many unnecessary attributes for my test scenario. The subtree represented by the root Node element is iterated one element after another and each its subtree is searched in the given XML document using XPath until the whole tree is checked or any subtree is not found.p  pThis solution works well only when I need to check if the subtree is present there or not. However, I use this to check large configuration files that are often changed and it is quite difficult to find the exact place where the change occurred. That is why I think about using some existing solution which has better output and allows to easily see the differences. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find anything matching my criteria.p  pIs there any tool that allows this I have heard about XMLUnit and have a quick look at it but I am not sure if it is capable of finding a subtree in a document ignoring any other elements or attributes. Can you show me an example how to do this in XMLUnit if it is possiblep

Negative 2419 pIve taken over a large and very old project recently.  It compiles without problems but since the code is so old and the former developers werent always doing things the way they were supposed to, I get a lot of warnings with a modern compiler.p  pNow I change parts of the code and sometimes introduce an error.  When I recompile the project, a lot of warning output is happening, and at the end of the output, I see a message like thisp  precodeSomeFile.C342651 warning deprecated conversion from string constant to char [Wwritestrings]          SomeCodeSome String                                 SomeFile.C342955 warning deprecated conversion from string constant to char [Wwritestrings]          SomeCodeSome Other String                                       make[2]  [SomeFile.o] Error 1 make[2] Leaving directory somepathofasourcedirectorysomesubdirectory make[1]  [somesubdirectory] Error 2 make[1] Leaving directory somepathofasourcedirectory make  [directory] Error 2  BUILD FAILED exit value 2, total time 2s codepre  pAnd a lot of warnings above that I just showed two of a list of dozens.p  pThe real error is displayed hundreds of lines above that and readsp  precodeSomeFile.C In function void someFunction SomeFile.C8915 error someIdentifier was not declared in this scope      someIdentifiergtsomeMoreStuffgtsomeMethodsomeArgs       codepre  pMy problem now is to find the error message.  It would be easy if I could strongturn off the warningsstrong because then the error message would be the last thing printed.p  pstrongSo is there a way to tell the compiler not to give out any warnings or at least print the error messages at the very endstrong that would be enough to solve my problemp  pI want to solve this issue with as little patch work as possible, so it is more or less out of the question to fix all code occurrences issuing the warnings, especially since I am about to throw away large parts of it in the end and just keep one feature I want to extract.p  pI can, however, change all files maybe inserting a codepragmacode or codedefinecode or similar at the beginning using codefindcode and codesedcode, I also can patch the codeMakefilecodes in all directories.  It would be nice, however, to be able to switch the solution off and on without having to patch too much if possible, I dont want to demand too much.p  pI found and tried some information on suppressing warnings, e. g. a hrefhttpdbpconsulting.comtutorialsSuppressingGCCWarnings.html relnofollowthis herea, but using options codeicode or codeisystemcode or codepragma GCC systemheadercode seems not to work in my case, probably because the file being warned about is the one given on the command line, not an included file.  The codepragmacode is being warned about itself because of this.p

Negative 2419 pWhat Im looking for is a very straightforward solution to the following in my XCode project When codeapplicationWillEnterForegroundcode is called, I want my main and only codeviewcontrollercode to reload as if the app is launching from scratch, the reason being I want it to recalculate a number of things at that point which might have changed while the app was in the background, in response to temporal changes detected when the app is launched. I want this to happen rather than the view just to reappear in its last seen statep  pThe codeviewcontrollercode is named codeTMViewControllercodep  pI have found answers that tell me simply that I have to reload the codeviewcontrollercode in the codeapplicationWillEnterForegroundcode section of the AppDelegate, but not how to do thisp  pI have found answers that explain how to reload various elements, labels, webviews, and data from the net. These are much more complex than I need, and I cant really see the needle for the haystackp  pAll I need to happen is the codeapplicationWillEnterForegroundcode to reload the codeviewcontrollercode as if its codeviewDidLoadcode had been called I understand that this in itself is not a good solution, not that I know how to do even thatp  pI suppose in a nutshell Im struggling to understand what needs to go in the h amp m files of both the codeAppDelegatecode and the codeviewcontrollercode files to accomplish thisp  pany help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 2419 pI have a custom layout for spinner. Its both selected and dropdown list items background color will change depending on user demand. So i am changing depending on their values.. so far so good. But the problem is since i am using custom layout or changing background color, there is no arrow to show that it is a spinner. When i add arrow from layout then all even dropdown list have that arrow with them. I can manipulate it by setting arrows background to null for drop down items but it is not a good way and dont always work.

Negative 2419 pI set myself a little task to acquire some basic Rust knowledge. The task was p  blockquote   pRead some keyvalue pairs from stdin and put them into a hashmap.p blockquote  pThis, however, turned out to be a trickier challenge than expected.

The keyvalue pair that Im extracting within the loop is therefore also bound to the loops boundaries. Thus, inserting them to the outer map would lead to a dangling pointer since text will be destroyed after each iteration. Please tell me if Im wrongp  pThe big question is How to solve this issue p  pMy intuition says p  pMake an owned copy of the key value pair and expand its lifetime to the outer scope .... but I have no idea how to achieve this.   p

Negative 2419 pMy question is not quite a programming question, more along the line of how to use the software. Well, I have a file that contains all of my stored procedures for a webpage approximately 100 stored procedures.

I was wondering if there was any way to minimize all of the stored procedures all at once.p  pI know that in Visual Studio you can highlight all of the code the press CNTRLMM and it will minimize all of the functions.

The problem i got is that when i try to update the values the values from the multiselect doesnt follow along to the controller. In the parameterMap method i have a console log and there i can see that all the values that the grid post to the controller is correct. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9fvkA.png altenter image description herep  pThe image above is from my chrome console and there i have 3 multiselect models that exists in the object and that is correct. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comiYIWo.png altenter image description herep  pOn the image above you can see what my controller method gets from the post.  It gets all the values from the customerobject and it also gets that there is 3 suppliers to the customer that got posted. But all the values for each of the suppliers is null. I guess this has to something to do with the binding of the multiselect but i just cant figure out why it doesnt work. Plz helpp

Negative 2419 pIm asking this question as a relative illiterate when it comes to programming, so I appreciate your patience with this one. p  pI am using the a hrefhttpwww.allmapsoft.comumd relnofollowUniversal Maps Downloadera on my desktop, Windows 8 to create highquality satellite maps for my own personal and occasional use. The program has the ability to request images from Google Maps at a high resolution, downloading thousands of static images at a time, and then tiling them all together to create a cohesive image. Well, halfway through downloading an image within 20003000 image requests I received a notice within the program that my strongIP may be banned from Googlestrong. p  pAfter some research, I realized that with an API key and developer account, I could download up to 25,000 images per day which would more than suit my purposes. So I signed up, created a strongKey for Server Appsstrong with my IP address, thinking that would solve the problem. 24 hours later now and the API console doesnt even recognize any static image requests at all. Obviously there is a disconnect between the program on my desktop and Static Maps API. p  pOr am I completely off base here Any info would helpThank you.p

Negative 2419 pIve been trying to use Theos to compile an application for iOS 5.1.1, which is the latest my old iPod Touch 3G supports. I figured I could write something to make it useful again.p  pI have installed the latest Xcode 6.1.1 running under Yosemite, which of course doesnt include the SDK for 5.1 anymore however, I did copy it from Xcode 4.4.1, so it should work. And, in fact, after setting the proper environment variables codeTARGETiphoneclang5.15.1code, codeARCHSarmv7code, I was able to get Theos to compile a working blank app just fine.p  pThe problem is, when I tried adding a little bit of complexity into the code, by including a dummy button, suddenly the preprocessor started to throw a bunch of errors. Reading the logs, I found this was the sourcep  precodeApplicationsXcode.appContentsDeveloperPlatformsiPhoneOS.platformDeveloperSDKsiPhoneOS5.1.sdkusrincludemachinetypes.h3510 fatal error        i386types.h file not found include i386types.h codepre  pAfter some investigation, I figured this was being caused by either codei386code or codex8664code being defined stronginsteadstrong of codearmcode, which caused the wrong include to be made. I took a peek at SDK8.1 and noticed that such an option isnt even present, so I tried to edit the 5.1 headers to remove any mention of i386 architeture. It didnt work  only made it worse.p  pFunnily, though, the app still seems to compile and run, despite that error being marked strongfatalstrong. After further experimenting, I traced the cause of the issue to this code linep  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt codepre  pOdd. I suspect it might be some inconsistency caused by using the latest Xcode as a base for compiling to outdated devices. For now, I will try to continue developing my app anyway, but I wouldnt be surprised if this issue came back to haunt me in the future, so Id like to solve it sooner rather than later. Any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 2419 pI have written a simple COM object in C with only one method, which is called GetMac.  I cant get it to work.

But I need to reference the schedule parameter so that the server knows what schedule my newly posted form data refers to.p  pIs there a simple jquery or js methodapproach to ask a server to tell you what the resolved url would be I keep getting the original url back when I try methods involving jquery .get.p

Negative 2419 pSo this is driving me crazy. Im running logrotate on a weekly basis for a few different logs and it works as I expect. However, the log rotation occurs on Sunday, which coincides with the completion of some processing that logs to those directories which are to be rotated. In a nutshell, I would like to rotate these log files on Thursday, prior to this processing, and I would like to keep the fix within the logrotate configurations themselves vice manually running logrotate force, or placing this within the script.p  pIm running RHEL5 with the following configurationsp  precodecat etclogrotate.dcustom varlogmpxxmpxxlog    daily   rotate 30   compress   missingok   olddir varlogmpxx.old   create 644 user user   dateext  varlogmpxxrepo.log varlogmpxxstoprepo.log    weekly   rotate 90   compress   missingok   olddir varlogmpxx.old   create 644 user user   dateext   cat varliblogrotate.status varlogmpxxrepo.log 2015412 varlogmpxxstoprepo.log 2015412 codepre  pI manually rotated the logs with logrotate force etclogrotate.dcustom on Friday April 10th when I noticed the issue.

be that some time after the connection finishes loading, the player item buffer goes empty. My thought at the moment is that something is being deallocated when the connection finishes loading and messing up the playerItem buffer.p  pHowever at the time the buffer goes empty the playerItem status is good, the video asset is playable, the video data is good p  pIf I throttle the wifi through charles and slow down the connection, the video will play as long as the connection does not finish loading within a few minutes of the end of the video. p  pIf I set the connection nil on the finished loading event, the resource loader will fire up a new connection when shouldWaitForLoadingOfRequestedResource fires again. In this case the loading starts all over again and the video will continue playing.p  pI should mention that this long video plays fine if I play it as a normal http url asset, and also plays fine after being saved to the device and loaded from there.p

Negative 2419 pIm creating a web service with a client that both have a server and client keystore. I followed the tutorial from Hamidreza Sattari  Spring web services 2 cookbook 2012, Chapter 7.

Negative 2419 pThe idea is that Im sending a message to an external device and setting a flag that tells the program that Im waiting for a specific response. Until it waits for the response, the program will continue receiving other messages and evaluating them to know if they are a response that I requested. For this, Im calling another function with a timer so I reset the flag after the configured timeout has expired. In other words, if such function executes and the flag is still marked as waiting for response, it means no response has been received, hence I show a message that a timeout has occurred. If the response arrives before the timer has expired, than I cancel the timer, process the response and reset the flag.p  pAny messages that are arriving while the timer is counting, are processed without any problems.p  pThe issue that Im having is that the second thread does execute and does end correctly, but I dont see any output from it. I can see it is running by calling the printer function below after the timer has started. I see 2 threads until the 12 seconds has passed, then I see 1 thread again. The 2nd thread should print some messages and in the full code it should generate events for an external application. But I dont see any prints from it, and I dont see the events that it should generate. I suspect of something related to scope, because Im creating a thread from a function to execute another function. I really would like this.p  pFor simplicity, Ive removed part of the code, but the program basically works like this The processData function is called when any data is received from the serial port. The MySensorsGatewayWrite is called when I want to send any data through the serial port.p  pAny help is very welcome since Im stuck now.p  pThanksp  precodeimport threading from threading import Timer,Thread,Event  global waitingforresponse waitingforresponse0 global t  def processData2 received     global waitingforresponse     if waitingforresponse  1         waitingforresponse0    reset for further use         print Response received strreceived     else         print Normal message that will be processed  def MySensorsGatewayWrite2sendMessage     global waitingforresponse     print Data to send strsendMessage     if sendMessagequestion         waitingforresponse  1  sets a flag so we can check it later         timerstart     else         waitingforresponse  0  unsets a flag so we can check it later  def timerstart     global t     global waitingforresponse     t  Timer12,checktimeout     t.start     print Starting to count the timer for str12 seconds     threadsativasthreading.activeCount     print Active Threads     print strthreadsativas  def checktimeout     global t     global waitingforresponse     t.cancel     print Finished to count the timer for str12 seconds     if waitingforresponse1   if it is still 1 after the timer period ie. flag has not been reset by receiving a response         print Didnt receive a response in time.

Negative 2419 pI am new to java applets. My new task is to create a Java Applet that can call methods from C .Net dll, i found the solution using strongUnmanagedExportsstrong here a hrefhttpssites.google.comsiterobertgieseckeHomeuploadsunmanagedexports relnofollowUnmanagedExportsap  pMy applet works well when running it from NetBeans in the Applet viewer window and also when i embed the applet in a web page it works well. I tried to publish my web page that contains the applet on my local IIS and i faced the security issue but the problem was solved when i signed my appletp  pstrongThe Problem isstrong As i knew java applets run on clients PCs. strongHowstrong can it will access the DLL on clients PCs or how can i download the dll on clients PCs so that applet can find the dll in the proper location on each client pc. I dont want to manually copy the dll on each client pc, i need the applet to download the dll somewhere on the client pc automatically.p
Negative 2419 pIve written and compiled a DLL in VS2008.  Ive created a windows form project to test the DLL.  Ive added a reference to my DLL and added it to the project as a link.  I have using myDLL in the form.  I can use the DLL classes and methods perfectly fine in the VS2008 environment, and running the Debug or Release versions work as intended.p  pHowever, Im testing how deployment would work, but anytime I try to load the created EXE it wont load.  Ive made sure to stick a copy of the DLL in the folder with the EXE but it still fails to load.  Its strange because it doesnt even throw an error message, it just stops working and closes.  I havent ever used assemblies before, but it was my understanding that they were unnecessary if you had references to them in the project  How can I get the EXE to work outside of the VS2008 environmentp
