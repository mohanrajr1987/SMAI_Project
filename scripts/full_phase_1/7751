Not only the one that the properties returned.  I also know this will cause issues if dealing between years of course p  pAnd finally the reason why I ask the question here, is that when the user selects the dates, and tries to get the items between the dates... The returned selection, is so random... Ive never seen the type of obscure results this SQL returns... I cant even see a pattern to it. I select one week, and it only gives 3 of the 5 days out of that week along with the first two weeks of the previous month... Another week selection is accurate... Another yet, gives 2 of the 5 days of that week...p  pstrongEditstrong  Based on the suggestion below, I now push query through with parameters.

Positive 7751 pIm working on an Access application with multiple nested forms on which the users clicks on selections in order to do specific tasks, e.g., enter new data, search for data, print a report, etc. p  pCurrently I have each form set with autocenter. I would like the user to be able to move the main form, then have all other forms open on top of the main form.

If the Access window is visible, the code works correctly. p  pApparently my method wont work with the Access window minimized and only the dialog forms show, as far as I can tell. Is there a different way to hide the Access window when the application is running that would allow the forms to be located correctly Or is there a different method of locating the forms on the screen such that each subsequent form will cover the previous form that opened it p  pThanks much for reading my question, and providing any thoughts you may have.p

Negative 7751 pIs it possible to programmatically construct a stack one or more stack frames in CPython and start execution at an arbitrary code point  Imagine the following scenariop  ol lipYou have a workflow engine where workflows can be scripted in Python with some constructs e.g. branching, waitingjoining that are calls to the workflow engine.pli lipA blocking call, such as a wait or join sets up a listener condition in an eventdispatching engine with a persistent backing store of some sort.pli lipYou have a workflow script, which calls the Wait condition in the engine, waiting for some condition that will be signalled later.  This sets up the listener in the event dispatching engine.pli lipThe workflow scripts state, relevant stack frames including the program counter or equivalent state are persisted  as the wait condition could occur days or months later.pli lipIn the interim, the workflow engine might be stopped and restarted, meaning that it must be possible to programmatically store and reconstruct the context of the workflow script.pli lipThe event dispatching engine fires the event that the wait condition picks up.pli lipThe workflow engine reads the serialised state and stack and reconstructs a thread with the stack.  It then continues execution at the point where the wait service was called.pli ol  pstrongThe Questionstrongp  pCan this be done with an unmodified Python interpreter  Even better, can anyone point me to some documentation that might cover this sort of thing or an example of code that programmatically constructs a stack frame and starts execution somewhere in the middle of a block of codep  pstrongEditstrong To clarify unmodified python interpreter, I dont mind using the C API is there enough information in a PyThreadState to do this but I dont want to go poking around the internals of the Python interpreter and having to build a modified one.p  pstrongUpdatestrong From some initial investigation, one can get the execution context with codePyThreadStateGetcode.  This returns the thread state in a codePyThreadStatecode defined in codepystate.hcode, which has a reference to the stack frame in codeframecode.  A stack frame is held in a struct typedefd to codePyFrameObjectcode, which is defined in codeframeobject.hcode.  codePyFrameObjectcode has a field codeflasticode props to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions541329isitpossibletoprogramaticallyconstructapythonstackframeandstartexecut541529541529bobincea which has a program counter expressed as an offset from the beginning of the code block.p  pThis last is sort of good news, because it means that as long as you preserve the actual compiled code block, you should be able to reconstruct locals for as many stack frames as necessary and restart the code.  Id say this means that it is theoretically possible without having to make a modified python interpereter, although it means that the code is still probably going to be fiddly and tightly coupled to specific versions of the interpreter.p  pThe three remaining problems are p  ul lipTransaction state and saga rollback, which can probably be accomplished by the sort of metaclass hacking one would use to build an OR mapper.  I did build a prototype once, so I have a fair idea of how this might be accomplished.pli lipRobustly serialising transaction state and arbitrary locals.  This might be accomplished by reading codelocalscode which is available from the stack frame and programatically constructing a call to pickle.  However, I dont know what, if any, gotchas there might be here.pli lipVersioning and upgrade of workflows.  This is somewhat trickier, as the system is not providing any symbolic anchors for workflow nodes.  All we have is the anchor In order to do this, one would have to identify the offsets of all of the entry points and map them to the new version.  Probably feasible to do manually, but I suspect it would be hard to automate.  This is probably the biggest obstacle if you want to support this capability.  pli ul  pstrongUpdate 2strong codePyCodeObjectcode codecode.hcode has a list of addr codeflasticode line number mappings in codePyCodeObject.colnotabcode correct me if wrong here.  This might be used to facilitate a migration process to update workflows to a new version, as frozen instruction pointers could be mapped to the appropriate place in the new script, done in terms of the line numbers.  Still quite messy but a little more promising.p  pstrongUpdate 3strong I think the answer to this might be a hrefhttpwww.stackless.comStackless Python.a  You can suspend tasks and serialise them.

Negative 7751 pI want to make a constructor function that creates a documentElement object.p  pAs an example, consider the new Audio constructor  it creates a documentElement object, and if you pass it some variables it populates the new documentElement with attributes.  It doesnt insert it into the DOM, it simply creates the object.p  pSo, the question is  what makes a documentElement different from a vanilla javascript object of the property value kind, and can you write constructors for them like you can for objectsp  pEditp  pWhat Im toying with is recreating the new Audio constructor in browsers that dont have it, using a quicktime or flash HTMLObjectElement in place of the HTMLAudioElement.p  pIts ok with me that audio.constructor will refer to HTMLObjectElement, as the result of using new Audio in browsers that support it, is that audio.constructor refers to HTMLAudioElement.p  pIm not sure about the Audio.prototype.  When I query console.logAudio.prototype in browsers with Audio support, they return nothing at all  not even an empty line in console.log  so thats got me stumped. If I understand right, though, it doesnt affect what Im aiming to do.p  pThe aim is to be able to code using the Audio constructor, and have the browser handle it natively or set up a plugin instance if it needs to.p

Negative 7751 pIve inherited a asp.net project and Im finding that the code behind pages contain a lot of business logic. p  pIve decided that in most cases its better to leave the working code in place than try and do a massive refactoring.

What Im finding is its very tedious work trying to locate the dependencies between the code behind and the page specific objects.p  pIm wondering if anybody knows of a tool, a VS feature, or a method that would allow me to systematically locate and attack these dependencies Something that will allow me to identify any area of the code that references ViewState, a textbox, panel, drop downlist, etc..., so I can move these references to method parameters and ultimately move this functionality out of the page class.p

Table1 is the vehicles table and Table2 holds information on each of the vehicles weapons.  p  pI can think of two ways to handle this.  One is to show all the information in one form, and use Javascript to allow users to add new subforms for each weapon as they need them.  Then process it all at once.  However, this is a little ugly and, obviously, relies on javascript.  So its not friendly to those who have javascript turned off.p  pThe other way I can think of, would be to have multiple pages.  The first page would allow the user to enter general data, then they could hit next to enter weapon data.  Each time they hit next, they could enter a new weapon.  Finally the fully entered vehicle would be displayed to them and they would be able to go back and edit each part of it as they so choose and, when they were ready, submit it.  p  pOn the one hand, this way requires a lot more processing than the first.  It is much more involved.  It would require that each step of the vehicles creation be added to the database for temporary storage while the user worked on it.  It would have to be marked as incomplete.  I would have to create some sort of cron job to clean out all the incomplete vehicles.p  pOn the other hand it uses no javascript.p  pAre there other ways of handling situations like this  If not, which of these two methods is considered the better practice  Is there a way to hang on to the data between form pages in the second method with out temporarily adding it to the dbp  pThe tools I have available to me are a MySQL database, PHP, javascript, htmlcss obviously, and a linux operating system.p

So for example if I get Region node and its parent is supposed to be a Country node, Im unable to cast ParentNode to Country class.p  pIs there a way to force nHibernate to instantiate the ParentNode and Child objects with their appropriate subclass This information is stored in the Type column, so itd seem reasonable for nHibernate to instantiate the correct subclass.p  pAlso are there any major concerns with using inheritance here Using a class hierarchy reduces the amount of code at least in the model, but Im worried that having these implicit rather than explicit relationships e.g. the parent of a region is always a country can get me into trouble later...p  pThanksp

Negative 7751 pIm just starting out learning ASP.NET.

The code behind class also has member variables that correspond to each control on the page, and provide a way for code in the code behind file to manipulate the controls.p  pFirst, do I understand this correctlyp  pSecond, could a site be setup with two separate ASPX pages with identically named controls, which both had a directive pointing to the same file and class Would you even want to do this Both pages could have the same functionality but a different layout. I was thinking this could be a way to create separate desktop and mobile versions of a page with out duplicating content in the code behind files.p  pI guess ultimately what Im wondering, is if there a way to define an abstract page Say create an abstract page definition that says a page must have controls cartlist, totallbl, but then be able to have multiple pages that inherit from this abstract pagep

Negative 7751 pIm developing a clientserver system for Windows Server 2008 in Visual Studio 2005 and C where the client connects to the internet through the server, and the server has an admin app that scans all the clients traffic and links it to each user.  I was using a hrefhttpcode.google.compcassia relnofollowcassiaa to capture the users info and link it to their traffic but cassia works with remote desktop users only and my app is not going to use remote desktop. p  pIm also planning on using Windump for the packet sniffing, but i still need to parse all the info i get from it and i need to capture somehow the user info that generates all that traffic. p  pBottom line therere 2 apps one on the client with windump sniffing all the traffic and the other on the server that keeps all the users info and and traffic which uses to compare it with the traffic patterns we define and with the old traffic generated.  If its off the pattern blocks the httphttpsssh port until it verifies the users credential. p  pThats pretty much what im trying to do. Any thoughtsp

For more details, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4944331googledataapihowtodoauthenticationfordesktopapplicationsread herea.p  ul lipIt seems that it is possible on Android to register an URL scheme for an application. An example is a hrefhttpnilvec.comimplementingclientsideoauthonandroid relnofollowherea.pli lipThis seems to be possible in a similar way on the iPhone. E.g. a hrefhttpiphonedevelopertips.comcocoalaunchingyourownapplicationviaacustomurlscheme.html relnofollowherea.pli lipFor Windows, it seems that I have to register that into the registry. See a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa76791428vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowherea.pli ul  pMy application currently is just a simple Python script. Also, the registering should not require some sort of Administrator permission.

Do I need to make separate loaders emandem event handlers Or am I just not using Loader correctly p
Negative 7751 pIn my web app, user is given 5 min to do some job, and after that 5 min, the job should be passed to other person. So, each job would have userid and that userid value has to be changed every 5 min. The thing is that there are multiple jobs, and we want to use 15sec interval for script to be periodically run to take care of this change. And job will passed to other person maximum of 45 times, and it will be disregarded after that.p  pThe job amp user data is stored in MySQL database.p  pMy initial thought was to use cronjob with PHP script file that let the cronjob runs PHP script every 15 sec. PHP file will read the job table, select all the jobs which have time value past 5 min ago, and fetch them to other users doesnt matter if one user get the all jobs or not. I just want to periodically run it without taking too much resources.. but is it a good idea Wouldnt that take too much resources once the number of jobs increases p  pWhile it does not have to be consistence 1316 sec interval is just fine we want that script does not stop.p

Negative 7751 pI have compiled a JNI dll that I would like to load into my Java application using codeSystem.loadLibrarycode. This works perfectly fine on Windows XP with the dll compiled using MSVC 2008 Express.p  pHowever, on Windows 7, where I compiled the dll using MSVC 2010 Express same options, same processor architecture, same Java version, just different OS and compiler the application would freeze upon the codeloadLibrarycode call. No error messages, no reaction at all. When I try codejstackcode on the frozen process it freezes as well no output, no termination. Running the application as an administrator does not fix this problem.p  pThe DLL and all its dependencies are in the codejava.library.pathcode. In fact, when I removed them, the Java application would tell me theyre missing, so the dll must have been initialized properly and something else fails. Debugging proves, however, that its actually codeloadLibrarycode freezing and nothing afterwards.p  pCan anybody tell me what might be going on herep  hr  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pAs stated in my comment below, this problem seems to go deeper. Using a simple C program to load one of the dependencies of said DLL already makes the freeze occur, so this must be some kind of problem with the Windows API and how MSVC linked the DLL that dependency was linked by MSVC 2010 Express as well.p
Negative 7751 pIve recently started experimenting with solr. My data is indexed and searchable. My problem is in the sorting. I have 3 fields Author, Title, Sales. What I would like to do is search against the author amp title fields but have the sales value influence the score so that matches with higher sales move toward the top, even if the initial match score is not the highest. p  pSimply sorting by sales does not produce valid results as a result with a near 0 score for the search term, but a lot of sales in general could end up above a perfect match for the term that has never been sold.p  pWhat I am seeing is results that, while great term matches, are not necessarily the product I want showing at the top of the list.p  pAny help is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 7751 pI have two tables from two different departmentsp  pstrongCustomerstrongbr IDbr Countybr Statebr Name, Age, etc.p  pstrongBilling Ratestrong  composite ID of CountyStatebr Countybr Statebr Pricep  pIn Hibernate, I have defined a ManyToOne relationship on a composite foreign key countystate.  I followed this a hrefhttpdocs.jboss.orghibernatestableannotationsreferenceenhtmlsingled0e217720Hibernate20Annotations relnofollowHibernate Annotationsap  pWell, Every Customer has a countystate, but not every countystate pair is represented in the billing table.  When I load some of the Customer entities, I get an exception of EntityNotFoundException for the relationship.  Based on my reading here same problem as me a hrefhttpcommunity.jboss.orgmessage522967 relnofollowJBoss Forumsa It looks like every relationship NEEDS to be there, although you can slap on a NotFoundactionIGNORE tag.  Well, I did that too and it works without error, but Im still having a problem.  Hibernate does not cache the negativehits, so if a countystate pair is NOT found, the exception is ignored, but the knowledge of that lack of data is not cached, so it reloads the relationship on demand, every time.  So, when I do a left join fetch on the relationship, it effectively does nothing for me.  Also, a batchfetch does nothing, I have to load them one at a time, and Im talking about thousands of entities.p  pWhat can I do to resolve this  Is the DB designed wrong  Thanksp

Negative 7751 pI have just noticed that when I have a running instance of my GAE application, there nothing happens with the datastore file when I add or remove entries using Python code or in admin console. I can even remove the file and still have all data safe and sound in admin area and accessible from code. But when I restart my application, all data obviously goes away and I have a blank datastore. So, the question  does GAE reads all data from the file only when it starts and then deals with it in the memory, saving the data after I stop the application Does it make any requests to the datastore file when the application is running If it doesnt save anything to the file while its running, then, possibly, data may be lost if the application unexpectedly stops Please make it clear for me if you know how it works in this aspect. Thanks.p

Can I associate a codeclean deploy Ucode to the build triggered by the SVN change but associate a clean deploy sitedeploy U to a build triggered by the periodical buildp  pAre my only choices to p  pstrong1.strong Convince everyone to have the sitedeploy with every snapshot build thus taking more time p  pORp  pstrong2.strong Create a new job for the weekly buildp

Negative 7751 pOkay,  Ive been going round in circles for the last 2 days trying to figure this one out.p  pI am working on a system that handles cases. Each case has a type and each type has an associated SLA which can be specified in days, hours or minutes.  In addition to this there is an administrative function which allows the user to specify the start and end time of the working day and which days in the week are worked.  I should point out that working hours are  the same for every working day.  So for example, the working hours might be 900 to 1330 on a Monday, Wednesday and Thursday.  Im not going to bother including holidays in this function just yet...Its tough enough as it isp  pstrongGiven the days and hours that are worked and the SLA,.. how can I calculate the date and time when the case breaches its SLA.strongp  pI get the feeling that since the minimum resolution of an SLA is set in minutes, Ill need to convert everything to minutes first.  Obviously the daytime that the case is created will have to be taken into account too.

Its probably also worth mentioning that if there is a library out there to do this Im happy to use it and move on.

Negative 7751 pI am currently developing a WCF service that will evolve over time to include new DTOs. I am currently using MEF withing the service implementation to export the webservice object. I have the WCF service project and the datacontracts project within the same solution. For now, both the projects are compiled under one solution.p  pEssentially what I want to do is to have a scheme that I can incorporate into the WCF service project  so that I can add new datacontracts in future. This scheme does not have to use MEF. These new datacontracts are to be developed in a different solution but under the same namespace or not. After compilation, I would only need to drop the new datacontracts assembly in the ..bin folder and restart the service. The service would then pickup the new datacontracts so that they can be spewed into the WSDL.p  pI hope this is specific enough.p

This would be great except that I need to use streaming with python and i am not able to include a custom streaming jar in my job so that seems not an option.p  pI see a hrefhttphadoop.apache.orgcommondocscurrentstreaming.htmlHadoopPartitionerClass relnofollowin the hadoop docsa that there is an alternate partitioner class available that can enable secondary sorts, but it isnt immediately obvious to me that it is possible, using either the default or key field based partitioner, to ensure that each key ends up on its own reducer without writing a java class and using a custom streaming jar.p  pAny suggestions would be much appreciated.p  pstrongExamplesstrongp  pmapper outputp  pcsv2tfieldA,fieldB,fieldC csv1tfield1,field2,field3,field4 csv3tfieldRed,fieldGreen ...p  pthe problem is that if i have 3 reducers i end up with key distribution like thisp  precodereducer1        reducer2        recuder3 csv1            csv2 csv3 codepre  pone reducer gets two different key types and one reducer gets no data sent to it at all. this is because the hashkey csv1 mod 3 and hashkey csv2 mod 3 result in the same value.p
Negative 7751 pHey there stack overflow crew,p  pQuick question that always seems to come up when building custom drop down navigation systems using jquery. Now the ideal scenario for drop down menus would be to have the parent and children in li tags however sometimes the design of the site does not allow this.p  pLets say you have a DIV containing your primary navigation items and another  below containing your child menus.p  pWhen you rollover the parent the child menu appears however when these are seperate s the rollout state gets tricky. So I nested the hovers to try and get around this and it alllmost works.p  precodediv.primarynav.mouseenterfunction        clearTimeoutthis.datatimeoutId     div.doormatnavwrapper.slideDownslow  .mouseleavefunction        div.doormatnavwrapper.mouseenterfunction           clearTimeoutthis.datatimeoutId         div.doormatnavwrapper.slideDownslow     .mouseleavefunction           var someelement  this         var timeoutId  setTimeoutfunction          div.doormatnavwrapper.slideUpslow         someelement.datatimeoutId, timeoutId set the timeoutId, allowing us to clear this trigger if the mouse comes back over                      codepre  pLogically what Im trying to achieve is p  pWhen the user rolls over the div.primarynav .... div.doormatnavwrapper shows... when rolling off the primary nav div.doormatnavwrapper hides UNLESS div.doormatnavwrapper itself is being hovered on.p  pAny feedback or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 7751 pIm trying to use a dependency injection container for the first time in a project, but I just discovered a problem that Im not sure how to address.p  pThe project provides a SOAP web service, which is implemented atop the SOAP component of Zend Framework. The way this works is that you define a class that acts as your service, you create a ZendSoapAutoDiscover or ZendSoapServer class for the WSDL or the class itself, as appropriate, and finally, you pass ZF the name of the service class via the constructor or via the setClass method. For examplep  precodeclass MyService   autodiscoveryObj  new ZendSoapAutoDiscover autodiscoveryObjgtsetClassMyService ... codepre  pThe problem is with that last step. My DI container can create a service object and inject into it all the required dependencies. Thats fine if I need an instance in my own code. However, bc you just pass the name of the class into ZF, and you dont get to actually instantiate it yourself, it doesnt get properly instantiated through the container so its dependencies are never injected. Further, I dont think I can use any sort of wrapper class, as ZF uses reflection on the class.p  pWhats the best way to handle thisp

This works, and so does the logic on the button. p  pProblem is that the height of the button is static, and this cant be the case. I need this button to simply match its parents height as you can see its in the toolbar view, which is just a horizontal linearlayout, as the height of the toolbar is different on the tablet sized views as opposed to the phone sized views. p  pI heard that I need to use LayoutParams, but I will be totally honest nothing i try validates, and when it does does nothing. And using setHeight seems to only accept numerical values. p  pIm sort of at a roadblock where Im not sure what else to try. p  palso is there something like a float right for realtime layoutp

Negative 7751 pSince a month ago i am studying restful web services really hard.  Now that i did practice the Syntax and i understand the concepts, i decided to make a very simple enterprise application that includes EJB, JPA and REST. I am making a big effort in trying to understand what is the best way to organize this kind of system. Ill appreciate a lot if someone with experience in the field could give me some tips on what would be the best practice, and how can i solve my current problem. p  pLet me show you this image please. Sorry i cannot get better resolutionUse Ctrl Mouse Scroll Up to zoomp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPz9yH.jpg altenter image description herep  pAs you can see this is a very simple enterprise app, that has 2 modules.p  pThis application does not use CDI I want to achieve my goal without CDI help andp  pWhen some clientAny interoperable client sends a GET with some parameters the REST service should pass those parameters to the EJB module which will search in the database and send back the appropiate data. At the end the service will automatically marshal with the help of JAXB and send the .XML back to the client. p  pMy problems are the followingp  ul liI get a ClassCastException because the entity in the that is in the EJB module is not compatible with the JAXB class in the WebModuleEven if their variables are the sameli liI dont know how things should be organized so the front end can marshal and unmarshal those entities.li liShould maybe the entity class be in the front end combined with the JAXB mapping If then, there will not be really need for the EJB module. But the thing is, i want the EJB module because i often do my CRUD operations there.li liWhat about exposing the EJB as a REST web servicemaking a hybrid Do you think this is a good idea How can it help me li liAgain if i create a hybrid of JAXRSEJB in the web module, i will must create then my JPA entities in the front end and that is a thing i never did before.

Negative 7751 pIm successfully testing an ASP.NET web site using the combination of NUnit and Selenium2. Ive no issues there. Im running my tests against a test website test system and tested site are separate although they may be on the same machine  they communicate over HTTP.p  pOne thing I want to do is to pull the sitemaps there are several from my test target site and automatically hit each page in sequence, just checking for exceptions etc.p  pObviously .sitemap files cant be pulled over HTTP. But I already have a little ashx handler for GoogleSitemaps which returns an XML version of the ASP.NET .sitemap file over HTTP. If youre not logged in you get the security trimmed version of the sitemap. However if you log in, this handler returns the site map you can see according to your role.p  pThe problem is   I can log in and log out driven from Selenium2, and the security trimming works perfectly Selenium2 can see what it should, cannot see what it should not.   However even when I am logged in, Im seeing the version of the site map for nonlogged in users its been trimmed Yet Im logged in and the test user has privileges to see precisely the things which have been trimmed away.p  pIm thinking then... the way ASP.NET knows Im logged in over HTTP must be those cookies which include by the looks of it some security token and session ID. Thats how the web pages know who the test user is and that theyre authenticated. The handler, the strongashxstrong, that beast is presumably not getting the cookie. I guess I could sniff it with Fiddler given enough time, but even if I prove that the cookies missing, I dont know how to get it in there. Clearly my codenew FirefoxDrivercode is passing cookies to the aspx pages, so whats up with the ashx pagesp  pAnyway, maybe Im up the wrong tree barking. Has anyone managed to get this type of thing working Note please that my sitemaps work fine, even from Selenium2 this question is specifically about Selenium2 and sitemap trimming when using a handler.p

Negative 7751 pI am looking for a low impact, osindependent profiler for c code. p  pWhen I say low impact, I am referring to something less intrusive than valgrind. I plan to use it in a MIPSbased embeded environment hence the osindependance and tried a ported version of valgrind and it completely changed the performance characteristics way too much Heisenberg principle at work so I cant go that route. We know the memory bus speed is a bottleneck which mostlikely explains why valgrind was so intrusive.p  pI have created a home grown type of profiler based on checkpoints that lets me measure certain parts of the code. Basically I have to modify the code and recompile to set checkpoints in strategic places in the code. Then, when executed, it stores the number of times each checkpoint is hit and the time since the last checkpoint was hit. Then, after running it, I can dump the checkpoints and for each it calculates numhits, maxtime, mintime, avgtime, etc.p  pThis profiler I called it LowImpactProfiler works ok, but I wonder if there is something better out there.p  pIve considered oProfile, which is a sampling profiler, but since Im not running Linux, I think it will be really dificult to implement.p
Negative 7751 pIm working on an iPhone application which requires a user to login to Facebook. However that is only to retrieve a  users friendslist, after that I wish to continue communication through my own XMPP server, I would like to automate the account creation to this server. p  pFor this I would need a username, which is pretty straighforward the facebook user id, however I would also need to create a password based on some sort of private key showing the user has logged in to Facebook. This key should be the same for any device logged in over any amount of time, Ive been looking at the Facebook API but could only find an access token, which I believe is different when the user logs in from a different device.p  pMy question Is there anything available from the Facebook API with these requirements Any suggestions for alternative solutions would be welcome too.p  pThanksp  pEditp  pExamplep  ol liUser uses the app for the first time on his iPhone, logs in with facebook and the app automatically creates an acount on my XMPP server, where the user ID is equal to the facebook ID and the password is something that shows the user has been logged into his facebook account.li liNow the user uses the app on his iPad, again logging into his facebook account, however already having an account on my XMPP server the same password must be generated from the data received from facebook.li ol  pStep 2 is the part which poses a problem for me, I need data that shows that the user has been logged into his account, and which is the same wherever and whenever he logs in, just so that the same password can be generated every time. I believe that if I use the accesstoken for this then this will change if the user for example doesnt log in for 60 days and starts using the app again, or maybe even when he logs into a different devicep  pTo clarify the XMPP server that Facebook offers is not to my needs, I need to be able to send other things besides chat messages and also need to be able to store messages so that new devices which log on can be synced to a proper state.p

Negative 7751 pI need to compare 2 pictures and find pixels that are different with specified threshold. Now Im doing it just programmatically in for loop, it take about 3 seconds for small 600x400 picture. Im wondering if there a way to do it faster using OpenGL, DirectX, CUDA or something like this So it will use GPU and not just CPU. Notice that in output I need an array of different pixels, not just boolean value depending on if it same picture or not.p  pSo I looked at source in delphi and it look like thisp  precodefunction TCanvas.GetPixelX, Y Integer TColor begin   RequiredState[csHandleValid]   GetPixel  Windows.GetPixelFHandle, X, Y end codepre  pSeems like it calls WinAPI function GetPixel each time. Probably thats why its so slow. So now my question is is there a way to get whole array of pixels via WinAPI Im working with a screenshot that have HBITMAP, so it will not be a problem to use it with WinAPI.p

Negative 7751 pMy Android app needs to display a fullscreen bitmap as a background, then on top of that display some dynamic 3D graphics using OpenGL ES either 1.1. or 2.0  not decided yet.

Negative 7751 pI have a form which uses multiple models, which have relationships. If the data for one of the forms matches an existing entry, I want to have the foreign key map to the existing entry rather than create a duplicate entry.  However, isvalid fails for the already existing entry and Im not sure if it is safe to use the form data before it has been cleaned to do a database lookup for existence first.  Perhaps I need to change the clean function to ignore the uniqueness requirement and then handle it in the viewp  pHeres an example, a user enters their name, city and state in a web form.  If that city is already known to the database, then the foreign key for the person should just point to the existing entry.  If it is a new city, it should be added to the database.  So it is always a CREATE for Person, but it may or may not be a CREATE for Hometown.p  pmodels.pyp  precodeclass Personmodels.Model     name  models.CharField     hometown  models.ForeignKeyHometown  class Hometownmodels.Model     cityName  models.CharField     stateName  models.CharField     mascot  models.CharField      If same city and state, its the same place     class Meta         uniquetogether  cityName, stateName codepre  pforms.pyp  precodeclass PersonFormModelForm     class Meta         model  Person         exclude  hometown  class HometownFormModelForm     class Meta         model  Hometown  codepre  pviews.pyp  precodedef newPersonrequest     if request.method  POST         person  PersonFormrequest.POST         hometown  HometownFormrequest.POST         if person.isvalid and hometown.isvalid             p  person.savecommitFalse             h  Hometown.objects.getorcreatehometown.cleaneddata             p.hometown  h             p.save codepre  pThis code doesnt work, because hometown.isvalid will be False if that citystate pair is already in the database.  Should I override the clean function to allow ignore the uniqueness requirement enforcing it in the view by using getorcreate or is that an indication that my design is fundamentally the wrong way of addressing this problemp

Also, the PNG and JPEG images are wellformatted  I can view them using a file browser on the device itself and I tried several other images as well.

However although the retrieved codeFoldercode can provide a list of all available folders, its type is not of type codeHOLDSMESSAGEScode, and so it cannot be used for accessing or searching messages.p  pIs there another way to search messages over all folders, or will I be required to search each folder individuallyp  pIm afraid I cant post more than two hyperlinks, but here is access to the a hrefhttpjavamail.kenai.comnonavjavadocscomsunmailimappackagesummary.html relnofollowJavamail com.sun.mail.imap documentationa, through which you can see information about the methods Ive been describing.p
Negative 7751 pIve been trawling through all the suggested posts for this topic but cant seem to find a solution that either works for me or I quite understand.p  pI am just trying to do a simple honeypot which checks if a hidden field is filled in by bots and breaks the form if so. My problem seems to be when it comes to using AJAX to see if the PHP value cleared. Hope that makes sense as Im not well versed in coding languages.p  pMy original idea was to disable the submit button for any bots that fill out the field. However seeing as the field is blank straight out the form loads the submit button and the point is lost.p  pThis is the part of the form checking for the botsp  precodelt THE HONEYPOT gt ltli idartificialdetectgt        ltlabel forartificialsgtIf you see this, leave this form         field blank and invest in CSS support.ltlabelgt        ltinput nameartificials typetext valuegt ltligt lt HONEYPOT gt  ltphp  spam  POST[artificials]  This is our Honeypot field ifspam    If the Honeypot field has been filled in     dieNo spamming allowed bitch   else  gt ltli classlastgt         ltinput classsubmit typesubmit namesubmitgt ltligt ltphp  gt codepre  pI dont understand what to do nowp  precodejQuery.salesforcecrmform .submit.clickfunction      jQuery.ajax       Get PHP function that determines whether the honeypot has been snatched.        codepre  pI am using an external URL for the action so I thought maybe that could only be inserted if the PHP returns clean of bots.p

The nested objects in the class constructor can contain any combination of properties and methods or other nested objects. Each individual object can have a property with the key inheritance that takes the following values implements, extends or false. Implements and extends correspond to the behavior of the Implements and Extends Mootools class mutators. Extends is the default, and is the method used when nothing is supplied for the inheritance property. A value of false will keep the given object and any objects nested within it from being inherited altogether.p  pThe entire code including examples can be found a hrefhttpsgist.github.com4013880 relnofollowhereap

Negative 7751 pI have worked in C but it were some years ago, last 5 or so years Ive almost only been working in Objective C and perhaps Ive just gotten comfortable doing so.p  pHowever I am writing a C jsonparser and it is conceptually difficult since there is no natural mapping as there is in Objective C. I am not saying its better one way or the other, just stating that I havent found a natural mapping.p  pSo in Objective C I would typically start parsing json as a NSDictionary since it maps really well. An NSDictionary is a keyvalue pair datatype, where the key typically is a string but can be any type and the value is typically an NSObject conceptually, and in Objc everything inherits NSObject so types are kind of autopolymorphic if you will. explanation given for any C developer which might know exactly how to help me but dont understand what I am asking for if I dont explain Objc.p  pAnyhow this mean that if I have an example jsonstringp  precodekey1, key23.14, key3hello world, key4[1,2,3] codepre  pit already maps exactly onto an NSDictionary where the first value would be an integer or number second a float or number third an NSString, and 4th would be an NSArray which hold three values which happens to be integers in my example but could be anything at all as long as its derived from NSObject.p  pIn C this is much harder for me to understand and find a good mapping or model for, I guess I could roll my own polymorphic types to do the same thing, then I can have a map with the abstract type and get pretty much the same behaviour.p  pBut either I am thinking that I will need to write my own containers map and vectors or write my own Jsontypes. However I am a bit afraid to be all too stuck in the way of thinking which is right in Objc, since its a very different language and built on completely different design ideas then C.p  pMaybe there is better and more correct ways to do stuff like this in C which I just dont know. So my questions is how to handle things which may have different types in a good way in C.p

Negative 7751 pOver the last couple of weeks, Ive been playing around with a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms404520.aspxthe unmanaged .NET debugging APIa.p  pWhile MSDN documents the interfaces itself, to find out how to actually use them in any meaningful way, I resorted to various blogs mainly a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combjmstallMike Stallsa and the managed wrappers in a hrefhttpwww.microsoft.comenusdownloaddetails.aspxid2282the CLR Managed Debugger samplesa and the a hrefhttpsgithub.comicsharpcodeILSpy sourcesa. In the end I was able to attach my test program to a running process, set breakpoints and hit them.p  pWhat I would like to do next is on hitting such a breakpoint, read a field of the relevant object instance. This works fine when the debug target method hasnt been NGENed or JITed, by a hrefhttpwww.reflector.net201203debuggingdebuggingexperiencedisabling loading NGENed assembliesa the environment setting COMPLUSZAPDISABLE1 and a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary9dd8z24x.aspxdisabling JIT optimizationsa aka the .ini file trick. p  pHowever, when I try the same with my ideal target  retail optimized NGENJITed code  it doesnt work.  For instance I can on hitting the entry breakpoint still retrieve the number of method arguments, but I cant get the first argument itself debugging API throws an exception.p  pNow, I imagine the reason for this is because the debugging APIs are supposed to be platform independent, and in this case the assemblies arent anymore. But what if I accept this platform dependency to an Intel one as far as Im aware the CLR uses the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiX86callingconventionsfastcall calling conventiona where in this case the ECX register contains the first method argument the implicit this reference for member functions.p  pI tested this, and indeed on hitting the breakpoint, ECX contains the OBJECTREF address of the object instance, in NGENed assemblies.p  pNow the final step in reading the instance field is to retrieve the field offset relative to this pointer, and this is where Im stuck, since I seem unable to find out how the CLR does a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinecc163791.aspxthe packing of the instance fields during native code generationa.p  pI realize this may be CLR versionimplementation dependent, but apparently there are ways, as WinDbg with the SOS extension is able to find this layout. If not through the debugging APIs, could I somehow leverage SOS.dll p

Because my head has gone and gotten all covered in pointy hair, I missed the significance of the annotations.p  pThe issue I had with the UpdateDatabase became clear when you suggested it was a rename issue.  Adding the Verbose option made that very clear to me.  I probably cheated, but I simplified the model by removing both of the starsystem references in it, updated the database and then added them back one by one.  p  pI also appreciate the code review on class capitalization and use of the virtual keyword.  I did leave the more descriptive prefix on id and name, but that is mostly for me as Im likely to get confused later if I leave them off.  Since the code is just for me, I decided to pass on that particular piece of advice, but the feedback was and is still most welcome.  p  pThank you both again for your time and expertise.p

Negative 7751 pI have a setup where I have an ASP.NET 4.0 user control that contains two textboxes, and an codeOKcode and a codeCancelcode button.p  pThe first textbox has an Ajax Control Toolkit Autocomplete Extender attached to it, to show the matching list of Swiss zipcodes when the user starts typing something.

Negative 7751 pI have a requestresponse protocol that runs over TCP that Id like to provide an asyncawait API for.  The protocol is STOMP, which is a fairly simple textbased protocol that runs over TCP or SSL.  In STOMP, the client sends one of six or so command frames and specifies a codereceiptcode ID in the header of the command.  The server will respond with either a codeRECEIPTcode or codeERRORcode frame, with a codereceiptidcode field, so the client can match the response with the original request.  The server can also send a codeMESSAGEcode frame at any time STOMP is fundamentally a messaging protocol which will not contain a codereceiptidcode.p  pTo allow multiple outstanding requests and handle any codeMESSAGEcode frames, the plan is to always have a codeSocket.BeginReceivecode outstanding.  So what I was thinking is that the easiest implementation would be to create a waitable event like a mutex, store that event in a table, send the command request with the codereceiptcode set to the index into the table, and block on the event.  When codesocket.BeginReceivecode fires the function can get the codereceiptidcode from the message, look up the event in the table, and signal it and store some state, like success or error.  This will wake up the calling function, which can look at the result and return success or failure to the calling application.p  pDoes this sound fundamentally correct  Ive used asyncawait APIs before but have never written my own.  If its OK what kind of waitable event should I use  A simple codeMonitor.Waitcode will block but not in the way I want, correct  If I wrap the whole thing in codeTask.Runcode will that behave properly with codeMonitor.Waitcode  Or is there a new synchronization construct that I should be using instead  Im basically implementing codeHttpClient.GetAsynccode, does anyone know how that works under the coversp

Negative 7751 pIm working on a Tomcat 7 JSP app and am using application level authentication. i.e. The user logs into a form that I check against a database. Then I set a user bean in the session to log them in. p  pIt seemed the logical thing to do at the time. But now Im questioning myself... Im getting bogged down in the details. p  pe.g. I check that the user is logged in on each secure page. If not, I redirect to the login page. Then the login returns them to the secure page. This has issues of the session times out. p  pe.g. The user edits a form basic CRUD. Then the phone rings. After the call, they submit the form but without a valid session. The action redirects to the login. But after login the form variables are blank and they create an empty row in the table... p  pI can think of ways to deal with this situation but now Im wondering if its a wild goose chase. Is there a better wayp  ul liIs there a FAQ that discusses the merits of application based or container based authentication li liIs there a nicely documented pattern for rollyourown authentication li liWill this scenario cause scaleability problems in the futureli ul  pLooking for alternatives.

Negative 7751 pIm trying to setup an onDrag Listener for a google map fragment, but cant get the drag event to fire. Since the map doesnt support drag events directly, Im trying to implement a drag listener for the View. I know about the onMarkerDrag event, but that does me no good since Im not trying to move markers around.p  pThe reason for trapping map drag events is twofold p  pFirst to detect if the user has panned the map. If they havent, I like to keep their location on the screen, and animate to their location if its not on the map. If they have panned the map, I assume they know what they want to see and force the location on the screen. this seems like something that should be included in the APIp  pThe second reason for trapping is to allow users to draw lines and polygons on the map. I can do this with onTap eventsadding points, but Id like to be able to let them freehand it as well.p  pMy code looks like thisp  pmainActivityp  precode    mMap  MapFragment getFragmentManager.findFragmentByIdR.id.map.getMap     setUpMapIfNeeded     mMapView  findViewByIdR.id.map     myMapDragListener  new MapDragListener     mMapView.setOnDragListenermyMapDragListener codepre  pThe Listenerp  precodepublic class MapDragListener implements OnDragListener                        public MapDragListener          super         say.logCatMapDragListener Im ALIVE           private AkamaiAnnounce say  new AkamaiAnnounce     private boolean inDrag     private boolean hasPannedfalse      Override     public boolean onDragView v, DragEvent event          say.logCatMapDragListener.onDrag   event.toString         String dotTAG  String getTag         if event.getLocalState  this            return false                  boolean myResult  true         int action  event.getAction         float x  event.getX         float y  event.getY         switch action          case DragEvent.ACTIONDRAGSTARTED           inDrag  true           break         case DragEvent.ACTIONDRAGLOCATION           break         case DragEvent.ACTIONDRAGENTERED           break         case DragEvent.ACTIONDRAGEXITED           break         case DragEvent.ACTIONDROP           myResult  false           break         case DragEvent.ACTIONDRAGENDED           inDrag  false  change color of original dot back           hasPannedtrue           break         default           myResult  false           break                  return false         return myResult            public boolean hasPanned          return hasPanned           public void setHasPannedboolean hasPanned          this.hasPanned  hasPanned        codepre  pThe map works fine.

Negative 7751 pI have checked all the related questions about this issue. The issue i have is, i have scala code and java code in same netbeans project.  The home env for scala is set. I use windows system for the development. I know that the build.xml of the netbeans project needs to be changed, to compile scala code first and then compile the java code. But i couldnt find much of example to do this on netbeans IDE. p
Negative 7751 pI am writing a library that other developers in our company will use. A state machine base class has a codeReadOnlyCollectionltTgtcode of allowed states, etc. Developers need to inherit from this class and set the allowed states.p  pI want to limit them to initialize the codeReadOnlyCollectionltTgtcode in the constructor of their derived classes and not be able to modify it later.p  pIf I declare the codeReadOnlyCollectionltTgtcode as a readonly property in the base class, that does not work since it cannot be modified in the constructor of the derived class.p  pI imagine this to be a notsouncommon scenario. Any elegant way to achieve this short of having developers override the codeReadOnlyCollectionltTgtcodep

In order to maintain the index fields I need to do the followingp  ul liOn strongAddstrong the index field should be set so that the new record is placed lastli liOn strongEditstrong, if the index has changed, the records in between the old and the new index  of the edited record need to be updatedli liOn strongDeletestrong the records having an higher index than the one being deleted need to be updatedli ul  pSo, what Im wondering is, instead of defining this behavior once for each class that is sortable, can I do it in a more generic way Ie. performing these actions for entities that implements an interface, ISortablep  pWhere should this logic be placedp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 7751 pI have a codeSplitContainercode on my form that has its Dock property set to strongFillstrong. It contains several child controls, many of which have event handlers attached to them. Later I decide to put a codeStatusStripcode at the bottom of my form. Guess what, I cant set the codeStatusStripcode to dock to the bottom of my form. The codeSplitContainercode will continue to Fill the entire form. Even though the codeStatusStripcode apparently gets docked to the bottom, it actually hides the bottom part of the codeSplitContainercode behind it. p  pThe only around it is to CUT the codeSplitContainercode and then PASTE it back. Cutting the codeSplitContainercode makes the codeStatusStripcode the only control on my form and thus lets it capture the bottom docking. Afterwards, pasting the codeSplitContainercode allows it to fill the remaining area. In short, docking uses First Come, First Serve method.p  pNow since my controls have lots of event handlers attached to them, cutting and pasting becomes a nightmare for me. Having my project in C means I have to attach all those event handlers manually.p  pIs there a better work aroundp

Negative 7751 pThis is more of a conceptdatabase architecture related question.

Negative 7751 pIm a Ruby newbie trying to use Mechanize to automate the process of logging into a support portal and submitting support trouble tickets for my work department so we dont have to remember to submit regularconsistent requests we have.  The support portal is an ASP based website with a web form for submitting support requests.  Ive been able to write a Ruby script that logs into the site, but when I try to have it submit a support request I am getting stuck.  The script runs and seems to login fine and submit but nothing actually gets submitted on the website  no errors appear in STDOUT.  I am including my script code and part of the log from mechanize.  If anyone has any tips I would be so grateful .  Again I am so new to Ruby and Mechanize I probably an missing something obvious.p  pChrisp  pHeres the mechanize ruby scriptp  precoderequire rubygems require mechanize require logger  agent  Mechanize.new  agent   agent.opentimeout    5   agent.readtimeout    5   agent.useragentalias  Mac Safari agent.log  Logger.newmech.log page  agent.get httpswww.mysite.orgdefault.aspx   Login to web portal form  page.formwithaction gt default.aspx form.fieldwithname gt ctl00SiteContenttbAccessId.value  ARGV[0] form.fieldwithname gt ctl00SiteContenttbPassword.value  ARGV[1] page  form.clickbutton   Access the support request form after logging in page  agent.get httpswww.mysite.orghelpdeskdefault2.aspx form  page.formwithname gt aspnetForm  form[EVENTARGUMENT]   form[EVENTTARGET]  ctl00SiteContentbtnSubmit form[ctl00SiteContentddlType]  10 form[ctl00SiteContentddlCategory]  2 form[ctl00SiteContentrbtnUrgency]  Standard form[ctl00SiteContenttxtDescription]  This is a test. page  form.clickbutton codepre  pAnd heres what I see in my mech.log after running the scriptp  precodeAuCB8egKAuOB2FegKAuGBresKAsOr2B54KArvqu9YLArvqu9YLArWF4bsHArWFkbgHArSFsbgHArSF4bsHAreF0bsHAreF2bsHAreF3bsHArSF5bsHAraFvbgHArWFsbgHArWFvbgHAraFsbgHAreF7bsHArWF3bsHAreF6bsHAreF4bsHAreF9bsHAuTcrvoPAu2zhJQDAuuzhJQDAumzhJQDAuizhJQDAvyzhJQDAuuzxJcDAu6zhJQDAu2BzhJQDAvOzhJQDAuqzhJQDAouM7vYPArKV8PkDAomzw8AJAqq7yucNAqbmgdMOAuLPiYYOAtv24HwCrbHt7goC9KHh9gkCrtjkwQsCwOeDqgQCocHXsAoCqKfM2wTlhszuh2F2iy3Lw42FAOkPihaler2Fg3D3Damp.x0amp.y0ampctl0024SiteContent24QuickSearch124SearchStringampctl0024SiteContent24QuickSearch124SearchTypeampctl0024SiteContent24ctl0024txtRequesterampctl0024SiteContent24ctl0024Typeampctl0024SiteContent24ctl0024Groupampctl0024SiteContent24ctl0024Status1ampctl0024SiteContent24ctl0024Locationampctl0024SiteContent24ctl0024urgencyStandardampctl0024SiteContent24ctl0024RequestDescriptionampctl0024SiteContent24ctl0024Resolutionampctl0024SiteContent24ctl0024RelatedToampctl0024SiteContent24ctl0024rid0ampctl0024SiteContent24ddlType10ampctl0024SiteContent24ddlCategory2ampctl0024SiteContent24rbtnUrgencyStandardampctl0024SiteContent24txtDescriptionThisisatest.

Negative 7751 pI am new to DirectShow. I, like many others, am trying to create a socketbased P2P streaming solution for a WPFbased card game. I want each player to be able to see each other via small video windows.p  pMy questions are twofold. The first is How do I lower the frame sample rate and resolution I believe 320x200 x 15 to 20 fps should be fine. I am using the SampleGrabber callback to grab frame data and send it over the socket which is actually working with no compression at 640x480 resolution.p  pMy second question is, since each frame contains 921,600 bytes, this really bogs down and I get very slow rendering just across my local WiFi connected LAN. I added a simple MJPEG compression wanting to switch to h.264 later and I noticed the bytes drop to around 330360k. Not a bad improvement.p  pOn the receiving end Do I need to create a custom DirectShow Source Pin in order to serve up the bytes received from the socket so I can attach a decoder and render the bytes in a windowp  pI just wanted to ask this first since it seems like a lot of work to create a new COM object havent done that in about 15 years, register it, and usedebug it.p  pIs there perhaps another wayp  pAlso if that is the way to go, should I use a SampleGrabber on the receiving end and create a BitmapSource from the decompressed bytes, or should I allow DirectShow to create a child window Thing is, I want to have more than one other player and I set an extra byte in the socket to tell what table position they are in. How do I render each position in turnp

For instance, Im trying to do HTML conversionsp  precode        int hex1  intMath.floorwork[j][k]  1048576  16         int hex2  intMath.floorwork[j][k]  65536  16         int hex3  intMath.floorwork[j][k]  4096  16         int hex4  intMath.floorwork[j][k]  256  16         int hex5  intMath.floorwork[j][k]  16  16         int hex6  intwork[j][k]  16 codepre  pAbove would be my list of multiple variables. So pseudocode would be if any of the above variables equals this. So if either hex1,hex2,hex3,hex4,hex5,hex6 equals, say 10. Then the corresponding variable would do something. For instancep  precode         String html              if hex110               html  A                        else if hex111               html  B                        else if hex1 gt 0 ampamp hex1 lt9               html  hex1                     html    html codepre  pIs there a way to do this above code, without having to copypaste the code 6 different times with a different variable each time ie, hex1 would be hex2, hex3,...p
Negative 7751 pHey everyone ive created a program that allows me to create,delete,update,list and retrieve user inputs for three arrays now im having an issue with my update function where i am unable to get the function to print the proper text instead of saying codeUpdate Player Player [player number] has a point total of [number of points] pointscode  it sayscodeUpdate Player Player System.int32[] has a point total of System.int32[] pointscodep  pdoes anyone know how to get this to work im thinking i need to store it into a new variable and just use the new variables for the update function but everytime i try it keep getting the same thing since the value between the new variable and old is the same and when the old one is changed the new one follows suitp  precode using

Negative 7751 pThis is my first post on StackOverflow and also my first Question. I had created a UserControl in WPF with the MVVM Pattern called Block. This UserControl should be used in another UserControl, as DataTemplate of a ListBox called Sector.p  pThe Block Control should be used as standalone and as DataTemplate for different UserControls.p  pIf I set the DataContext in the View of Block, the standalone Version works great, but not as part of the Sector View.p  pIf I dont set the DataContext in the View of Block, it works in Sector but dont standalone.p  pMy question is, is it the only way to leave the DataContext in the View of Block and set it in the View I used the Control or the ViewModelp  pHere is my Codep  pstrongModel of Blockstrongp  precodepublic class BlockModel  ModelBase      region private Variables      string blockName  Block     string blockContent  00000      endregion private Variables      region Properties      public string BlockName              get  return blockName          set  blockName  value NotifyPropertyChangeBlockName             public string BlockContent              get  return blockContent          set  blockContent  value NotifyPropertyChangeBlockContent            endregion Properties      region ctor      public BlockModel         endregion ctor  codepre  pstrongViewModel of Blockstrongp  precodepublic class BlockViewModel  ViewModelBase      region private Variables      string charToFill  0     DelegateCommand fillWithChar     BlockModel dataModel  new BlockModel      endregion private Variables      region Properties      public Models.

Negative 7751 pI have come across a strange error and am looking for some insights.p  pstrongScenariostrongp  pA powerpoint file on a shared drive is opened by user A. User B now wants to open the same file, and is presented with a open as read only dialog. User clicks OK.p  pThe file is opened, and an addin runs whenever a file is opened to check for certain tags on slides, indicating presence of confidential material. This causes an error in the following functionp  precodeFunction taggedSlidetagName As String  find the slide which is tagged with tagName Dim oSl As Slide  Set oSl  Nothing  For Each oSl In ActivePresentation.Slides   If LenoSl.TagstagName gt 0 Then        ltltltltltltltltltltltltltltlt this is the line that causes error     Set taggedSlide  oSl     Exit Function   End If Next oSl Set taggedSlide  Nothing End Function codepre  pThe function ostensibly loops over all slides in the presentation, looks for a tag called codetagNamecode, and returns the slide or Nothing. It emlooksem like this only involves read operations, but the code throws an error at the indicated line.p  pTo make things more interesting, the behavior is emdifferentem if I simply mark a file as read only, save it, and open it. The difference seems to be that I can modify the file in that case  I just cant save it. But strongthis file cannot be edited at all, even if I dont save it.strong  And the above read operation is treated as a modification...p  pI have the following questionsp  ol liIs there a document property that I can read in VBA to tell me this is a cannot modify file I am looking for something akin to codeActivePresentation.ReadOnlycode, but that is set for a read only file, and this is different.li liWhy does the line codeIf LenoSl.TagstagName gt 0 Thencode get treated as a modifying file operationli ol  pIt was difficult to reproduce this error, because I really needed to have two users open the same file saving the file as readonly was not enough to make it happen.

Negative 7751 pI am in the process of converting the Apple DateCell app to use UIPickerView instead of UIDatePicker.  Ive pulled out and replaced references to UIDatePicker with UIPickerView in storyboard and throughout the code.

Negative 7751 pUPDATE I used the IE debug console, and it turns out setSelectionRange isnt valid in IE... why it works from Visual Studio, but not outside of it is beyond me, but basically the JS fails at that line, and never returns false... so now the question is how can I code it differently so that IE will perform Ive tried to look for JQuery plugins, but havent found one yet...p  pSo Ive got some validation done by some javascript, and some prefilling as well, for some textboxes in a gridview.  the code is supposed called from the onkeypress event.  It works just fine in debug mode... the characters are limited to numbers, and the y and m key presses auto populateappend the word years or months, and the curser is correctly positioned at the end of the numbers portion.  It also works in Chrome and FF.  However, most of our company runs on IE9 and this problem also happens in IE10 on my pc.  Once I deploy the aspx page, the IE users still get the character restrictions and autofill, but the characters y and m arent suppressed, and the curser placement doesnt happen, so the curser is at the end of 9 Yearsy or 6 Monthsm.  the javascript is listed below I know that there are quirks behind javascript implementation, but why would it only be happening after I deploy the code.  And any suggestions on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated...p  precode    var timeFrame  function evt, txtbox, max      if evt.type  blur      var charCode  evt.which  evt.which  event.keyCode     if charCode  46 ampamp charCode gt 31                   ampamp charCode lt 48  charCode gt 57                      if charCode  121  charCode  109                          if charCode  121                              fill with years                             var entry  txtbox.value                             var words  entry.split                              if max                                  txtbox.value  Maximum .concatwords[1],  Years                                 txtbox.setSelectionRange8  words[1].length, 8  words[1].length                                 return false                              else                                  txtbox.value  words[0].concat Years                                 txtbox.setSelectionRangewords[0].length, words[0].length                                 return false                                                                                if charCode  109                              fill with months                             var entry  txtbox.value                             var words  entry.split                              if max                                  txtbox.value  Maximum .concatwords[1],  Months                                 txtbox.setSelectionRange8  words[1].length, 8  words[1].length                                 return false                              else                                  txtbox.value  words[0].concat Months                                 txtbox.setSelectionRangewords[0].length, words[0].length                                 return false                                                                             else                          return false                                                       var str  txtbox.value                 if str                        if charCode  46 ampamp str.indexOf.  1                          return false                                          if max                          if txtbox.value.indexOfMaximum  1                              txtbox.value  Maximum .concatstr                             str  txtbox.value                                                   var words  str.split                          if isNaNparseIntwords[1]                              txtbox.value                            else                              txtbox.setSelectionRange8  words[1].length, 8  words[1].length                                               else                          var words  str.split                          if isNaNparseIntwords[0]                              txtbox.value                            else                              txtbox.setSelectionRangewords[0].length, words[0].length                                                                                  return true                        ltaspTextBox IDTermTextBox runatserver Textlt BindTerm gt onKeyPressreturn timeFrameevent, this, false onKeyUptimeFrameevent, this, false onblurtimeFrameevent, this, false  MaxLength25 Width200px gt codepre

Looking at the stack trace would be immensely helpful so I can see the difference between Foremans output and the Heroku logs. However, I dont get a traceback in either of the two, so I cant tell what exactly is breaking.

Negative 7751 pIve recently asked the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21772317differencebetweenfunctionlevelscopeandblocklevelscopequestiona about the difference between the emfunction level scopeem and emblock level scopeem. The answer was comprehensive and helped me to understand the emfunction level scopeem and introduced the emhoistingem concept.p  pNow I have another deliberation. The example is a jQuery code.readycode function and an event handler declared within it. That is to say, why a variable declared in code.clickcode event handler is not being hoisted up to the code.readycode function  Is that because code.clickcode is not property of the code.readycode function  and the variable declared within code.clickcode is being hoisted only up to that functionp  pExamplep  precodedocument.readyfunction     selector.clickfunction         var x  10 discussed variable       codepre  pIm trying to teach JS script myself, but this concept is really hard for me to understand.

I would like it to be based off the total number on the first column Departments since people will always have to be placed into a department, that way it updates automatically without my finding the end of the range.p

Negative 7751 pAs  a topicp  pIm having problems with codefinalizing collision detectioncode  in my codeplatformerstyle gamecode.brp  pim using rectangles method to do this, and codecollision detection works finecode there.p  pThe question is  In which order should my game look for codecolisionscode Because if i firstly check if player stands on the platform and then collisions on the sides, game gets confused then player hits the platform from the side, while in airduring a jump. It teleports player to stands on position, and then ignoring side collisions.br When i set the game to check side collisions firstly, when a player lands on a platform, hes teleported to left side, or right side of a platform. I do understand what is happening , but i dont have an idea how to solve this.br If you would like me to post some more infocode just tell me.br Thanks p

Negative 7751 pI am using a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles15633ManipulatingNTFSJunctionPointsinNET relnofollowthisa libray in order to create or get my junction points. Once I have got such a codeJunctionPointcode instance I am able to create a codeDirectoryInfocode from the codeLinkcodes strongstrong path and read the codeLastWriteTimeUtccode property.  Now I would like to set this timestamp to another date, but it doesnt work The value stays the same and no exception is thrown.p  pstrongstrong Thats the path to the location, where you find the junction point.p  pIm suspecting, that you will need to make use of some PInvoke in order to get this done. Either by specifying the desired timestamp on creation or afterwards using a second method. So I looked up the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa363858vvs.85.aspx relnofollowdoca for codeCreateFilecode, which is used for creating the junction point, hoping to find something helpful. The codedwFlagsAndAttributescode parameter seems to accept some flagsnumeric values and the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa365535vvs.85.aspx relnofollowdoca  for the codeSetFileAttributescode method doesnt look better.p  pI havent much experience on working with PInvoke, some good advice would REALLY be appreciated.p  pstrongEditstrongp  blockquote   pI dont want to download code.

Negative 7751 pI am developing an app where I would like to be able to stop users from uninstalling the app and reinstalling to create a new user account. Its a fitness app and they get pointspenalties depending on activity levels. p  pNow as far as I can tell I can only get two unique identifiers from the device, the Vendor ID which will be reset once the user uninstalls the app or the advertiser Id which the user can reset at will. So as far as I can see, no real way of doing it if the user is savvy enough. p  pSo, how do whisper do it, I played with the app a while ago and upon reinstalling it it knew exactly who I was. As an experiment I uninstalled the app, reset my advertising if and restarted the phone. I then reinstalled the app and again it knew exactly who I was. p  pHow is this possible I thought the whole point of the user being able to reset these things is to allow for them to block trackingp  pI would very much like to have this ability in my app, but cannot see any way with the current apple apis and guidelines to make it workp

Negative 7751 pIn my universal iOS app I have a collectionView holding a default number of 16 items, although strongthe user will be able to add custom itemsstrong.

To accommodate this, the cells can shrink to make room for the additional cells  There must be a minimum cell size so that the cells do not become too small.  If the minimum size is met then the UICollectionView will scroll.  If there is any free space, this can be divided amongst all cells.  Cells can have different heights amp widths, but this must be consistent across all cells so five cells with a height and width of 100 amp 80 is finep  pIm having trouble working out the maths for this. The UICollectionViews bounds will differ across devices or size classes, to accommodate iOS 8 but Id love some helpguidance to find a onesizefitsall approach to the sizing of item  if such a solution exists.p  pSo, could someone point me in the right directionp  pThanksp

Here, is there any way that i can update the whole items rightly without using the SystemClock.sleepSomeTime p

Negative 7751 pI feel like Im taking crazy pills, but Ive just hit a brick wall and cant hack at this anymore. The answer seems simple, but my mind is numb and I cant break through this particular wall.p  pI am using the Roo gem to import an excel doc xls format and push it into an array. I wind up with an array of arrays. Easy enough, that works fine.p  pSo then I try and take the values of that array and assign them to an objects attributes.

Im sure what Im doing is all kinds of garbage, but Im stuck and cant think of a solution.p  pHere is my controllerp  precodeclass PlanesController lt ApplicationController   def new     plane  Plane.new     plane.upload   end end codepre  pThis is my modelp  precode    require roo      class Plane lt ActiveRecordBase         attraccessor id, name, version      def upload             arr  []             sheet1  RooSpreadsheet.openlibassetstest.xls             sheet1.each  hash arrltlthash              i  0             while i lt arr.length do                 id  arr[i][0].toint                 name  arr[i][1]                 version  arr[i][2]                 i  1             end         end     end codepre  pBasically is how do I get my values stored in the arr array to be assigned to my object I want id to wind up being Plane.id, which is accessed in my controller by the instance variable plane.

Negative 7751 pI have a general question. I am currently working on a tracking project, where initially I used a head detector using HOG  SVM. In order to train the model, I used the default HOG parameters from Dalal et als paper which are optimised for the fullbody and I crossvalidated for the best SVM C and Gamma.p  pThe question is, does someone know whether it was a good idea to use the default HOG parameters, or was it better that I fine tuned for the best parameters. The reason I did not fine tune before is because I read in this paper a hrefhttpgroups.inf.ed.ac.ukcalvinPublicationsmarinIJCV14.pdf relnofollowDetecting People Looking at Each Other in Videosa, that finetuning did not obtain them any improvement in accuracy. Also, I am asking this question as I am finding some little strange false positives while using the sliding window approach.p

Negative 7751 pI am hoping someone can help me because I am attempting to do something that is beyond my limits, I dont even know if a function exists for this within PHP or MySQL so my search on google hasnt been very productive.p  pI am using PHPWord with my PHPMySql Project, the intention is that I want to create a word document based on a template.p  pI have used this a hrefhttpjeroen.isphpwordtemplateswithrepeatingrows relnofollowguidea which is also on stack exchange.p  pHowever this approach requires that the number of rows and the values are hard coded, i.e. in his example he has used cloneRowfirstname, 3, which then clones the table to have 3 rows, and then goes on to manually define the tags, i.e. p  precodedocgtsetValuefirstname1, Jeroen docgtsetValuelastname1, Moors docgtsetValuefirstname2, John codepre  pI am trying to make this dynamic, in my instance I am trying to make a timetable, and one of the child tables is exactly that, so the query I have looks up how many entries there are and then collects a count of them, this count is then used to dynamically create the correct number of rows.  This is the count I am usingp  precoders10  CustomQueryselect count as count FROM auditplanevents where AuditModuleFk . result[AuditModulePk].  data10  dbfetcharrayrs10 Count  data10[count] codepre  pI then use this codedocumentgtcloneRowdate, Countcode to executive the clonerow function, which works great and my document now looks something like a hrefhttpprntscr.com7b2ivz relnofollowthisa.p  pSo, so far so good.p  pWhat I now want is for a way to then append each row value of the query into the document, so rather than manually setting the tag value i.e. codedocgtsetValuefirstname1, Jeroencode I could use something like codedocgtsetValuefirstname1, name from row 1code  I suspect this will involve a foreach query but not too sure.p  pI hope the above makes sense, but please feel free to ask me for anything else and become my personal hero.

Negative 7751 pIm writing a simple strongfile cachestrong. In this context, I would like to implement strongthree methodsstrong to modify a file  codecreatecode, codereadcode and codedeletecode.p  pWhen a file is subject to deletion, I intend to first check whether its being read and delete it afterwards. I first want to give a strongpriority to the call to codereadcode over codedeletecodestrong. But I also want the strongcodereadcode to be able to be executed by multiple threadsstrong. nonexclusive lockp  pMy first idea was to have a synchronized counter to monitor the number of reads going on with each file in my cache.

Negative 7751 pOccasionally when I attempt to get data about a subreddit gallery, it will return an empty list. I would consider this normal behavior, except most of the time when I try to request a page that doesnt exist, it returns the first page. For example  if I tried to get page 1000 of the paradoxplaza subreddit, it would return the equivalent of page 0. However, on some subreddits, it instead returns an empty list.p

Negative 7751 pIm writing a C programm using GTK3.0. Anyway, I think this question may apply to any framework that uses events  signals. p  pI have a container class, say codecontainerClasscode and a child class, say codechildClasscode. A codechildClasscode object codechildcode is contained inside a codecontainerClasscode object codecontainercode. p  pThe codechildcode object is written to modify properties of something. To this aim, it has codeGtkEntrycode, codeGtkButtoncode and so on. When I click the save button, an event is raised. p  pThis event must be handled by the codecontainercode object, because the codecontainercode is interfaced with a database in someway. p  pHereafter, you find the solution Im using to do the jobp  precode Child class class childClass       void setClickHandlerExternalvoid extFunstring property, void      void clickHandlerExternalstring, void        void clickHandlerExternalData         static void buttonClickedGtkWidget widget, void data   void childClasssetClickHandlerExternalvoid extFunstring, void data        Set the external event handler     clickHandlerExternal  extFun     clickHandlerExternalData  data   void childClassbuttonClickedGtkWidget widget, void data      childClass m  childClass data       Call the external event handler     mgtclickHandlerExternalproperty, mgtclickHandlerExternalData    Container Class class containerClass      childClass child     static void clickHandlerstring property, void data   containerClasscontainerClass       Set the event handler     child.setClickHandlerExternalvoidstringampthisgtclickHandler, void this    void containerClassclickHandlerstring property, void data       Event handler in the upper class      containerClass m  containerClass data     FINALLY, DO THE JOB WITH PROPERTY  codepre  pThis works well and does the job.
