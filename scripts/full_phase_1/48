Positive 48 pI was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction to help me devise a high level algorithm to solve a problem like the one explained below, using Drools.p  pLets consider a billing system in which for a given month, and a given service, I can get from the database millions of records, like call detail records CDR, i.e. with a client id and many other fields which I want to use to reason over in the rules. The thing is, that I do not only need to take actions based on the individual records, but also based on conditions that would apply to certain aggregations. For example, lets say that a different price would be applied for all the CDRs after a certain threshold number was reached that is, each CDR after the 500th is cheaper. In reality, the rules would be much more complicated than that.p  pNow, I am pretty sure that the idea is not to insert all these records together into the engine KieSession and afterwards fire all the rules. Therefore, I would need some Object, lets call it an accounting element, in which I can collect all the information from each processed record. In this case I would dop  precodefor each CDR loop     Insert a record     Fire all the rules     Delete the record codepre  pAnd inside the Drools rules I would need to update my accounting object, e.g. counting the number of records processed for each clientservice.p  pMoreover, since I am also going to be taking decisions based on this accounting object, it will also have to be inserted in the KieSession, and remain there through the whole session, rightp  pI appreciate any advice you can give me regarding possible solutionimplementation approaches to such a problem using Drools, and please do tell me if what I said makes sense or correct me if it doesnt.

Positive 48 pI am trying to come up with a theoretical solution to an NxN problem for data aggregation and storage. As an example I have a huge amount of data that comes in via a stream. The stream sends the data in points. Each point has 5 dimensionsp  blockquote   ol   liLocationli   liDate li   liTimeli   liNameli   liStatisticsli   ol blockquote  pThis data then needs to be aggregated and stored to allow another user to come along and query the data for both location and time. The user should be able to query like the following pseudocodep  blockquote   pShow me aggregated statistics for Location 1,2,3,4,....N between Dates 01012011 and 01032011 between times 11am and 4pmp blockquote  pUnfortunately due to the scale of the data it is not possible to aggregate all this data from the points on the fly and so aggregation prior to this needs to be done. As you can see though there are multiple dimensions that the data could be aggregated on.p  pThey can query for any number of days or locations and so finding all the combinations would require huge preaggregationp  blockquote   ul   liRecord for Locations 1 Todayli   liRecord for Locations 1,2 Todayli   liRecord for Locations 1,3 Todayli   liRecord for Locations 1,2,3 Todayli   lietc... up to Nli   ul blockquote  pPreprocessing all of these combinations prior to querying could result in an amount of precessing that is not viable. If we have 200 different locations then we have 2200 combinations which would be nearly impossible to precompute in any reasonable amount of time.p  pI did think about creating records on 1 dimension and then merging could be done on the fly when requested, but this would also take time at scale.p  pQuestionsp  ol liHow should I go about choosing the right dimension andor combination of dimensions given that the user is as likely to query on all dimensionsli liAre there any case studies I could refer to, books I could read or anything else you can think of that would helpli ol  pThank you for your time.p  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pWhen I say aggregating the data together I mean combining the statistics and name dimensions 4 amp 5 for the other dimensions. So for example if I request data for Locations 1,2,3,4..N then I must merge the statistics and counts of name together for those N Locations before serving it up to the user. p  pSimilarly if I request the data for dates 01012015  01122015 then I must aggregate all data between those periods by adding summing namestatistics.p  pFinally If I ask for data between dates 01012015  01122015 for Locations 1,2,3,4..N then I must aggregate all data between those dates for all those locations.p  pFor the sake of this example lets say that going through statistics requires some sort of nested loop and does not scale well especially on the fly.p

Positive 48 pI have a enterprise application where there are multiple sub applications doing different tasks. These sub applications will interact with each other with Web Services to share functionalities among each other and complete a task for a user either themselves exclusively or combination from two application functionalities.p  pThere is a common set of large number of assets items present in a sub application say Asset Store on which these sub applications work which is also exposed to all these sub applications through its Web Services. This Asset store may be an external system or not deployed in same environment or may be outside cloud in which other sub apps are present. So, performance might be a hit outside the network.p  pNo, considering a user of Sub App  1 who want to perform a task on a selected set of these assets, will login to Sub App 1, go to a screen which will show him all the assets available. He selects those assets and add in his kitty to perform some actions on them, process these assets and then complete the task for him. Similarly, different sub applications will access this common Asset store to process them in different manner based on the sub application user is logged into.p  pWhile processing these assets in Sub App 1, we can do it in three waysp  ol lipWe make LIVE Web Services calls to Asset Store sub application to return us set of these products based on user search or criteria. In this case we are not storing anything in Sub App 1 database till now. Once the user selects an asset, process it in Sub App 1, we just store an ID of that processed asset in Sub App 1 database.pli lipWe follow the same steps as of 1 but instead of always making Live Web Services call to Asset store, we first check in local cache at application server of Sub App 1 in case it is present there, return the asset else make a live call to Asset store to fetch the asset. Rest same processing follows and we just store the Asset ID in sub app 1 database for that processed asset.pli lipI duplicate all the assets data of Asset Store in database of Sub App 1, create sync jobs to nightly sync contents between external Asset Sore and Sub App 1. Now, instead of making a Live call to external Asset store, I choose my sub app 1 database to return me the results from local db which will be quite fast in response. Process the asset and save the relational IDs of asset in the sub app 1 database which can be used to pull all other info. associated to that asset from the local DB only of sub app 1. However, since I said though I have gained the performance by duplicating the asset database locally. However, since all my Sub applications in this application uses this common asset store for one kind of processing or other, I will have to duplicate this data and write night jobs to sync data between all these applications and my common asset store.pli ol  pMy question is, which of these approaches are best suited for the current context of the application and why The number of assets in the asset store are around 3035000p  pAny help in defining the reasons is highly appreciated.

Positive 48 pI have an application in which I want to have strict separation between backend and frontendGUI.p  pThe backend is the application logic with cpp classes and the frontend are QML files with some cpp classes which mainly works as adapters to the backend.p  pNow I was wondering if it is okay to have classes derived from QAbstractModel in the backend form a design point of view.p  pMy first thought was that they should NOT belong to the backend because they are just a wrapper around some Qt Container classes to reflect their data in the GUI. So a pointer to the actual data can be injected and they should only be used in the frontend for displaying purpose but they should not be used anywhere in the backend.p  pThe Qt Container classes of course should belong to the backend.p  pNow I also need some conversion and utilities functions which act and maybe modifies the data of the containers. Therefore I wrote a handler class. But now it is starting to get tricky to keep everything in sync especially without getting bindingloops.p  pThe other solution would be to have a class derived from QAbstractModel which wraps the data and also have these conversion and utilities functions. They could then call the dataChanged etc. functions. Then I could use this class also in the backend. But would that be good design or should the backend be free of QAbstractModel derived classesp  pSince I find it quite difficult to express my issue clearly, I hope my question is understandable in some way p

Positive 48 pWhat would be an appropriate REST compatible approach that would allow a client to call a RESTful service in order to convert a large document to a target format p  pI was thinking about something similar to this p  ol liClient makes a codePOSTcode on codeconversionrequestcode resource with conversion configuration target type, secure key, notification resource URL in the form a hrefhttphosttobenotifiednotificationstatusid relnofollowhttphosttobenotifiednotificationstatusida that will return a request id.

Negative 48 pAfter the previous question What are the important rules in Object Model Design, now I want to ask this p  pstrongIs there any way to have dynamic properties for class instancesstrongp  pSuppose that we have this schematic object modelp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEAwrg.gif altobject modelp  pSo, each object could have lots of properties due to the set of implemented Interfaces, and then become relatively heavy object.

Negative 48 pIve been reading up on LINQ lately to start implementing it, and theres a particular thing as to how it generates UPDATE queries that bothers me.p  pCreating the entities code automatically using SQLMetal or the Object Relational Designer, apparently all fields for all tables will get attribute strongUpdateCheck.Alwaysstrong, which means that for every UPDATE and DELETE query, ill get SQL statement like thisp  precodeUPDATE table SET a  a WHERE ax AND bx ... AND zx, ad infinitum codepre  pNow, call me a purist, but this seems EXTREMELY inefficient to me, and it feels like a bad idea anyway, even if it werent inefficient. I know the fetch will be done by the clustered primary key, so thats not slow, but SQL still needs to check every field after that to make sure it matches.p  pGranted, in some very sensitive applications something like this can be useful, but for the typical web app think Stack Overflow, it seems like strongUpdateCheck.WhenChangedstrong would be a more appropriate default, and Id personally prefer strongUpdateCheck.Neverstrong, since LINQ will only update the actual fields that changed, not all fields, and in most real cases, the second person editing something wins anyway.  p  pIt does mean that if two people manage to edit the same field of the same row in the small time between reading that row and firing the UPDATE, then the conflict that would be found wont be fired. But in reality thats a very rare case. The one thing we may want to guard against when two people change the same thing wont be caught by this, because they wont click Submit at the exact same time anyway, so there will be no conflict at the time the second DataContext reads and updates the record unless the DataContext is left open and stored in Session when the page is shown, or some other seriously bad idea like that.  p  pHowever, as rare as the case is, id really like to not be getting exceptions in my code every now and then if this happens.p  pSo my first question is, am I wrong in believing this again, for typical web apps, not for banking applications Am I missing some reason why having UpdateCheck.Always as default is a sane ideap  pMy second question is, can I change this civilizedly Is there a way to tell SQLMetal or the ORD which UpdateCheck attribute to setbr  Im trying to avoid the situation where I have to remember to run a tool Ill have to make thatll take some regexes and edit all the attributes in the file directly, because its evident that at some point well run SQLMetal after an update to the DB, we wont run this tool, and all our code will break in very subtle ways that we probably wont find while testing in dev.p  pAny suggestionsbr  War stories are more than welcome, id love to learn from other peoples experiences on this.p  pThank you very muchp

However, at runtime when i have the second class act as the delegate to the third class, and the third class ends up calling one of the unimplemented optional methods on that delegate, i get a runtime error essentially saying Target does not respond to this message selector.  I thought that objectivec handled this case correctly, and that it would just do nothing if that method wasnt actually defined on the class.  Might there be something im missingp

Negative 48 pI need to execute a bunch of up to 1000000 sql statements on an Oracle database. These statements should result in a referentially consistent state at the end, and all the statements should be rolled back if an error occurs. These statements do not come in a referential order. So if foreign key constraints are enabled, one of the statements may cause a foreign key violation even though, this violation would be fixed with a statement that would be executed later on.p  pI tried disabling foreign keys first and enabling them after all statements were executed. I thought I would be able to roll back when there was an actual foreign key violation. I was wrong though, I found out that every DDL statement in Oracle started with a commit, so there was no way to rollback the statements this way. Here is my script for disabling foreign keysp  precodebegin    for i in select constraintname, tablename from userconstraints             where constrainttype R and status  ENABLED      LOOP execute immediate alter table i.tablename disable constraint                             i.constraintname    end loop end codepre  pAfter some research, I found out that it was recommended to execute DDL statements, like in this case, in an autonomous transaction. So I tried to run DDL statements in an autonomous transaction. This resulted in the following errorp  pORA00054 resource busy and acquire with NOWAIT specifiedp  pI am guessing this is because the main transaction still has DDL lock on the tables.p  pAm I doing something wrong here, or is there any other way to make this scenario workp

Negative 48 pI have a small header file of my own which declares a couple of functions, one of which has a return type of codeDWORDcode.  Im reluctant to drag in codewindows.hcode just to get the official definition of this type since that file is huge, and my header will be used in a number of source modules that dont otherwise need it.p  pOf course, in practice I know that codeDWORDcode is just codeunsigned intcode, but Id prefer the more hygienic approach of including an official header file if possible.p  pOn a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa38375128VS.8529.aspxthis pagea it says that codeDWORDcode is defined in codewindef.hcode, but unfortunately including just this small file directly leads to compilation errors  apparently it expects to be included by other headers.  Also, the fact that my file is a header file also means I cant just declare codeWIN32LEANANDMEANcode, since the source file that includes my file might need this to be left undefined.p  pAny ideas  I know its not the end of the world  I can just continue to codeinclude ltwindows.hgtcode  but thought someone might have a better ideap  pstrong[EDIT]strong Thanks for your responses.  To those who suggested using a different type, let me explain why thats not desirable in this case Ive set up different, platformspecific versions of the two functions in different source files, and ask the CMake configuration to detect the current platform and choose which one to build.  On Windows, my functions look likep  precodetypedef DWORD TimePoint TimePoint GetTimeNowvoid double TimeDifferenceTimePoint start, TimePoint end codepre  pThe Windows version of codeGetTimeNowcode just calls the Windows API codetimeGetTimecode, which has return type codeDWORDcode, and so it must have the same return type.  On other platforms, codeTimePointcode will have a different type, e.g. codestruct timevalcode on UNIXy platforms.  In effect, values of type codeTimePointcode are opaque, and the only thing you can do with them is pass two of them to codeTimeDifferencecode to measure the elapsed time between them in seconds.  This enables crossplatform development.  Unfortunately it still means that client code has to know the concrete type of codeTimePointcode.p

Negative 48 pI have created a communication library which is linked statically into several different applications. The library provides support for communication via different kinds of hardware. Some of the hardware is supported from the vendor via a shared library. On systems without those kinds of hardware, the shared library is not available.p  pPreviously we handled this by compiling dual versions of the communication library and the applications. This is however not very practical, so I thought about using a more dynamic communication library which tries to load the vendor library with dlopendlsym if it is available. This seems to work well. But a problem is that everyone who use my library will need to pass the ldl option when linking their application with my library. Even if this is a minor nuisance I wonder on how this is normally solved.p  pIs it somehow possible to create a static library that will automatically at compiletime or runtime bring in the needed shared library p  pIs it considered good practice to let static libraries have dependencies on shared librariesp  pEDIT I know that libtool could probably solve this, but that would still change the build process for all applications even more, which I would prefer to avoid.p  pEDIT 2 Target platforms are primarily Linux and Solaris. Gcc as compiler.p

Negative 48 pI am implementing a Save As Copy function for a small web app that uses MySQL.p  pLets say I have three tables, like so...p  precodeTABLE Doc  ID,  title,  text  TABLE DocAttributes  ID,  DocID gt DocID  title,  text  TABLE DocSubAttributes  DocAttrID gt DocAttributesID  title,  text codepre  pWhat we have here is a situation where a single Document can have multiple DocAttributes, and each DocAttribute can in turn have multiple SubAttributes.p  pNow, if I did not have to worry about the DocSubAttributes table, this would be fairly straightforward, and I would do something like this...p  precodeinsertID  INSERT INTO Doc title, text SELECT title, text FROM Doc WHERE ID  docID  INSERT INTO DocAttributes DocID, title, text SELECT insertID AS DocID, title, text FROM Doc WHERE ID  docID codepre  pHowever, because there is a third onetomany table, this method doesnt work. I need to know the primary keys for each DocAttributes row for creating the corresponding rows in  DocSubAttributes.p  pThe only way I am aware of to do this is to iterate through DocAttributes one row at a time, selecting all DocSubAttributes with each iteration, and then doing each insert, again one at a time, iteratively.p  pI am wondering Is there a simpler way to duplicate these rows in their respective tables to create an entirely new and separate data entity without relying on iterationp  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 48 pWe have narrowed our choices for caching down to memcached and redis in our application. We already have considered and will apply Output Caching in our application. My question is what is your experience with both and which one should I preferp  pWe are expecting about 400000 users later on hence we are thinking of caching and we are in process of optimizing our application by profiling and fixing queries. We also considered Ncache but because of price its out of contention. At the same time we think that memcached and redis will perform equally for free.p  pBut what would be a better option for caching keeping in mind we are using asp.net mvc 2, sql server 2005 and entity framework 4 Are there issues that I should be aware of with any of them  p  pAny suggestions or ideas are welcome Thanks a lot.p

Negative 48 pWeve been recently implementing Scrum and one of the things we often wonder is the granularity of tasks within stories.p  pA few people inside our company state that ideally those tasks should be very finely grained, that is, every little part that contributes to delivering a story should represent a task. They argument that this enables tracking on how we are performing in the current sprint.p  pThat leads to a high number of tasks detailing many technical aspects and small actions that need to be done such as create a DAO for component X to persist in database. Ive also been reading Ken Schwaber and Mike Beedles book, Agile Software Development with Scrum, and Ive taken the understanding that tasks should really have this kind of granularity in one of the chapters, they state that tasks should take between 4 to 16 hours to complete.p  pWhat Ive noticed though, is that with such small tasks we often tend do overspecify things and when our solution differs from what weve previously established in our planning meetings we need to create many new tasks or replace the old ones. Team members also refrain from having to track each and every  thing they are doing inside the sprint and creating new tasks since that means well have to increment our total tasks in our burndown chart but not necessarily adding a task that aggregates value. p  pSo, ideally, how granular should tasks be inside each storyp

Negative 48 pOK, heres the scenario. I think its pretty common, and I have solved it in a prior life using a bruteforce approach, but Im thinking there has to be a better way.p  pGiven an ordered list of names, and a UI where the user can reorder, delete, edit and add names to the list, how would you update the list stored in a SQL databasep  pHeres the table definitionp  precodeCREATE TABLE [dbo].[AssyLines]   [AssyLineID] [int] IDENTITY1,1 NOT NULL,   [ShortName] [varchar]16 NOT NULL,   [LongName] [varchar]45 NOT NULL,   [Seq] [tinyint] NOT NULL, CONSTRAINT [PKAssyLines] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED  codepre  pWhat I want to do is read all entries from the table and display them in Seq order in the UI. The user can then edit ShortName or LongName, reorder the list, add new entries or delete existing entries, then save the modified list back to the database.p  pThis is a clientserver application, if that makes any difference. The WCF service handles the database interaction, the client just ships an array of records to and from the service.p  pMy bruteforce approach involves locking the table, deleting all entries, then rewriting the new records out to the table  all inside a transaction, of course, using a stored procedure and either a table variable or temp table. Crude but effective, yet I cant help feeling there is a fairly standard way to do this without nuking the table and recreating it every time someone makes a minor edit.p  pAny ideas I have 4 or 5 such lists in the application I am currently working on.p  pThanks, Davep

Negative 48 pI have three PyGTK SpinButtons that are mutually dependent on each other call them A, B, and C. There is another button D that toggles between two reciprocal definitions of C, such that the value of C is defined as AB unless D has been pressed an odd number of times. p  pI want to be able, for example, to change A and have B emorem C update immediately according to this relationship. I also want to be able to change B and have A emorem C update immediately. Same goes for C. Ive decided that when one is changed, the SpinButton that was least recently changed should be updated, and that if no SpinButtons have been changed since the program began, it should be assumed that C was changed most recently. p  pEverything above has been implemented. My application listens for the valuechanged signals for each of the SpinButtons, performs the calculations above, and then updates the value of the other two as described. However, the application picks up its own changes and responds to them. When I change A, my program changes B, which is handled by changing C, and so on. I have tried the changevalue signal too but it does not respond to changes to the SpinButton.p  pHow do I listen for a change in value of a SpinButton in a way that will not be triggered by the program itselfp

Negative 48 pIn order to be able to calibrate a monitor, I must be able to drive it in device RGB values.p  pIn order to do this I create a NSColor byp  precode[NSColor colorWithDeviceRedcolorsPtr[cnt]255.0f greencolorsPtr[cnt1]255.0f bluecolorsPtr[cnt2]255.0f alpha1.0] codepre  pAnd then I put this Color on the View.p  precode[colorView setColor[colorsForMeasuring objectAtIndexindex]] codepre  pWhen I use the DigitalColor meter, this device color is only applied without any conversion when the View is shown on the primary monitor. So only on the monitor that has the menu bar on it.p  pIn case you put the view on your second monitor, it looks as if there happens a conversion from RGB of main display to RGB of the second display. You only see this if there is a big difference between gamuts of both displays. I have a MacBook Pro with an Eizo ColorEdge CG 245 for example. If you then put [0 0 1.0] you might get something like [0.2 0.1 1.0].p  pAnyone an idea how to get rid of this extra conversion. Up to my opinion deviceRGB should be deviceRGB. In order to make a profile for the second monitor, this is mandatory. Now I have to move the menubar to the second monitor, create the profile and move it back. But with our application customers need to be able to do a validation and this needs to be done frequently. And the same problems occurs here.p

Negative 48 pHeres my problem, i searched for some solutions in vain. So, i have the checkbox range selection plugin on my website. Moreover, i have a function on checkbox click. I want to fuse both functionnalities  when i click on a checkbox, the click function runs. But, if i want to run the function on each checkbox affected by the range selection by shiftclick, how can i get this event  I tried to catch it with .change function, with no result, the only checkbox triggering the function if the clicked one. Other checkboxes are checked, but the function doesnt run for them...p  pHeres a part of code, if you want p  precode I enable the range selection on desired checkboxes .shift.enableCheckboxRangeSelection  Here i want to catch the checking event from the range   selection and alert something to confirm .colorlabel.changefunction  alertok  codepre  pSo, i just get 1 alert  the clicked checkbox, not the others. So, is there any solution to catch the check event without clicking  I thought at checked selector, but thats not an event... Other solution would be executing another function after the range selection, using checked, but i cant. For exemple, i want to colorize a div background. I check a color, a checkbox in this div, and the div colorize in the selected color while the checkbox is checking. Then, i want to colorize a group of other checkboxes in another color checked selector wont work correctly as it will colorize each div in the same color... You see what i mean p  pThanks in advance, i hope im clear enough... p

Negative 48 pI would like to build a website that has some elements of a social network.p  pSo I have been trying to think of an efficient way to store a friend list somewhat like Facebook.p  pAnd after searching a bit the only suggestion I have come across is making a table with two ids indicating a friendship.p  pThat might work in small websites but it doesnt seem efficient one bit.p  pI have a background in Java but I am not proficient enough with PHP.p  pAn idea has crossed my mind which I think could work pretty well, problem is I am not sure how to implement it. p  pthe idea is to have all the ids of your friends saved in a tree data structure,each node in that tree resembles one digit from the friends id.p  pfirst starting with 1 node, and then adding more nodes as the user adds friends. A bit like LempelZiv.p  pevery node will be able to point to 11 other nodes, 0 to 9 and X.p  pX marks the end of the Id.p  pfor example see this treep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comJtYSJ.gif relnofollowAn Exampleap  pIn this tree the user has 4 friends with the following idsp  ul li0li li143li li1436li li15li ul  pstrongUpdatestrong as it might have been unclear before, the idea is that every user will have a tree in a form of multidimensional array in which the existence of the pointers themselves indicate the friends id.p  pIf every user had such a multidimensional array, searching if id y is a friend of mine, deleting id y from my friend list or adding id y to my friend list would all require constant time O1 without being dependent on the number of users the website might have, only draw back is, taking such a huge array, serializing it and pushing it into each row of the table just doesnt seem right.p  pIs this even possible to implementp  pWould using serializing to insert that tree into a table be practicalp  pIs there any better way of doing thisp  pThe benefits upon which I chose this is that even with a really large number of ids millions or billions the search,add,delete time is linear depends of the number of digits.p  pId greatly appreciate any help with implementing this or any suggestions for alternative ways to improve or change this method.p

Negative 48 pFirst of all sorry for my poor English. Please let me explain my scenario first, I have data stored in Memcached as a group of gzip data. I call each a chunk of data. Each is loaded from the database, compressed and stored in Memcached in advance. This is done as a preparation process before the service can be available. To reduce load on the database p  pMy server code then simply fetches the gzip data from Memcached and then returns the gzip data immediately.p  pFrom userss perspective, they can request any number of chunks at the same time.  For example, assume that there are 10 chunks on Memcached, a user may request a single chunk, which in this case I can send back a gzip file as a response without any problem. But when a user requests a number of chunks at the same time, I simply dont know how to deal with it. Getting a number of chunks and compressing them as a single GZIP file is  not a solution. I simple want to send requested gzip files simultaneously as a single request.p  pMy first thought is that I will load data from the database, and then store them in  Memcached without compressing them. When a request comes in, I will get a stored data in Memcached and then compress it and send it back. But doing this is surely a waste of cpu cycle since the compression must be done every time the response is created. So I want a way not to compress them, just send them back immediately and the browser still understand what I send.p  pIf my question puzzles you, please let me know I will try to elaborate it. Because I really need helps.p

Negative 48 pIm wondering what some of you AjaxjQuery gurus think about the approach of updating the page when an Ajax call starts, without waiting for the server to return the response. p  pFor example, imagine youre developing a page like GMail. When the user deletes an email, you should remove that DIV, LI, whatever HTML element represents it from the DOM. One way to do this is to make an Ajax call to the server, wait for the server to actually delete the data in the database, and then it can return a JSON including the ID of the email to delete in DOM. Then, we can remove this element from DOM in success method of Ajax request. p  pWhile this to me is the most logical and clean way of doing this, sometimes processing on the server may take a little while. In such cases, we can remove the element from DOM BEFORE even hitting the server. To the user, this looks like a significant boost in the performance of application. p  pWhilst the second approach may be useful in scenarios where performance is more important than efficiency, it may be undesirable in other cases where the expected response is more than just deleting something on the client. An example could be adding some sort of hierarchicalnested elements with CSS classes. Generating these content on the server is easier as Im assuming it should already be available there as some sort of PartialView in ASP.NET MVC or equivalent in other technologies. Building these markups on the client can get a bit tricky and may end up in a mess. Im aware there are methods like jQuery tmpl out there that facilitate this. But we are in fact duplicating the layout of a given response One version on the server and one on the client. Things can get out of sync and also get harder to test. p  pJust wondering if anyone has come across scenarios like this. Please share your thoughts and experiences. p  pCheers, Moshp

Negative 48 pIm trying to share strings and integers throughout multiple views for a final project in an introductory iOS development course, around 50, and am wondering how I would go about doing this...  I know the MVC paradigm is best but we didnt get to very advanced stuff, especially core data.  I was thinking of using NSUserDefaults, I know its wrong but this app doesnt have to be blazingly fast, and I think this would be the simplest way for me.  My question is, where and how would I declare the NSUserDefault object I would be using  The only time in class that we used it was in one view.  If I declare it in the first view thats loaded I know I can access it with the other views but do I need to import the header file of the first view into each of the others or will it be accessible regardless  p  hr  h2Updateh2  hr  pSo I thought I would try to make things easier by making codeNSUserDefaultscode a property in all of the codeViewControllerscode.  Then to attempt to get the values back I implemented the headers from each of the codeViewControllerscode into the view that needs to access the data stored in NSUserDefaults which also has an codeNSUserDefaultcode property.  The app runs terrifically until I get to that screen and nothing is updated.  Im sure my mistake lies somewhere in how I implemented the  codeNSUserDefaultscode but I am unsure of how to do it correctly.  When we went over them in class actually its a Directed Study with Sams Teach Yourself iPhone Application Development in 24 Hrs puke, it makes me rage, the only time we used them was in a single view application that changed the alpha of a white background so it could be used as a flash light.

Negative 48 pI have an idea for an iPhone app that will make billions of dollars for me, and help me take over the world. I am currently designing the architecture of the application. I had originally assumed that I would need to create and host a database that would allow users to upload their data and share it with other, targeted, users.

However, I havent been able to find anything that would suggest this is possible.p  pIs it possible to send data between iPhones that are not in close proximity bluetooth and not on a LAN For instance...User 1, who is in Tennessee, creates some information and hits Send to others and it sends that information directly to User 2, who is in Arizona, and User 3, who is in Maine.

But, it is worth asking because, if it can be done, this would dramatically change the architecture and maintenance costs of this application.p  pThanks, in advance, for whatever advicepointers you can give.p

The script hangs on codevwaitcode. I know the code seems a bit oddwonky for handling processes with two variables, but this was a desperate last ditch effort to get this to work. p  pA dead signal is sent to the correct process in the form of codesecondDeadcode or codefirstDeadcode. I have the timeout value set at 1 second for the interact, so that it is forced to keep checking if the codewhilecode loop is true, even while the user is interacting with that telneted session. Once the dead signal is sent, it waits for confirmation that the process has died through codevwaitcode.p  pThe issue is that once the signal is sent, the loop will never realize it should die unless it is given the context to check it. The loop needs to run until it is kicked out by codefirstcode or codesecondDeadcode. So there needs to be some form of wait before switching to the next process, allowing the loop in codeprocessInteractioncode of the previous process to have control. p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

Here is the ko that I have found to interferep  pdatabindforeach filtersp  pThis little code is inside a div wrapping others. But the main problem is the foreach is interfering with KendoUI.

Negative 48 pIn my application I do System.Array.Resize once per frame. Initially I set my arrays to a maximum possible size, and then Resize them to something smaller. In some cases it may be a lot smaller, in others it may be just a little smaller. It appears to me though that the more elements there are to resize, the longer it takes. Perhaps my observations are wrong, and that is why I am asking here.p

Negative 48 pI had a lovely conversation with someone about the downfalls of codestdstoicode. To put it bluntly, it uses codestdstrtolcode internally, and throws if that reports an error. According to them, though, codestdstrtolcode shouldnt report an error for an input of codeabcxyzcode, causing codestoicode not to throw codestdinvalidargumentcode.p  pFirst of all, here are two programs tested on GCC about the behaviours of these casesbr a hrefhttpideone.com6J6D7strtolabr a hrefhttpideone.comdHBcdstoiap  pBoth of them show success on code123code and failure on codeabccode. p  hr  pI looked in the standard to pull more infop  pstrong 21.5strongp  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecodeThrows invalidargument if strtol, strtoul, strtoll, or strtoull reports that   no conversion could be performed. Throws outofrange if the converted value is   outside the range of representable values for the return type. codepre  pThat sums up the behaviour of relying on codestrtolcode. Now what about codestrtolcode I found this in the C11 draftp  pstrong7.22.1.4strong  p  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecodeIf the subject sequence is empty or does not have the expected form, no   conversion is performed the value of nptr is stored in the object   pointed to by endptr, provided that endptr is not a null pointer. codepre  pGiven the situation of passing in codeabccode, the C standard dictates that codenptrcode, which points to the beginning of the string, would be stored in codeendptrcode, the pointer passed in. This seems consistent with the test. Also, 0 should be returned, as stated by thisp  pstrong7.22.1.4strong  p  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecodeIf no conversion could be performed, zero is returned. codepre  pThe previous reference said that no conversion would be performed, so it must return 0. These conditions now comply with the C11 standard for codestoicode throwing codestdinvalidargumentcode.p  hr  pThe result of this matters to me because I dont want to go around recommending codestoicode as a better alternative to other methods of string to int conversion, or using it myself as if it worked the way youd expect, if it doesnt catch text as an invalid conversion.p  pSo after all of this, did I go wrong somewhere It seems to me that I have good proof of this exception being thrown. Is my proof valid, or is codestdstoicode not guaranteed to throw that exception when given codeabccodep

Negative 48 pIm trying to implement a system of retrying ajax requests that fail for a temporary reason. In my case, it is about retrying requests that failed with a 401 status code because the session has expired, after calling a refresh webservice that revives the session.p  pThe problem is that the done callbacks are not called on a successful retry, unlike the success ajax option callback that is called. Ive made up a simple example belowp  precode.ajaxSetupstatusCode      404 function          this.url  existenturl         .ajaxthis        .ajax     url inexistenturl,     success function  alertsuccess   .donefunction      alertdone  codepre  pIs there a way to have donestyle callbacks called on a successful retry I know a deferred cant be resolved after it was rejected, is it possible to prevent the reject Or maybe copy the doneList of the original deferred to a new deferred Im out of ideasp  pA more realistic example below, where Im trying to queue up all 401rejected requests, and retry them after a successful call to refresh.p  precodevar refreshRequest  null,     waitingRequests  null  var expiredTokenHandler  functionxhr, textStatus, errorThrown       only the first rejected request will fire up the refresh call     ifrefreshRequest          waitingRequests  .Deferred         refreshRequest  .ajax             url refresh,             success functiondata                   session refreshed, good                 refreshRequest  null                 waitingRequests.resolve             ,             error functiondata                   session cant be saved                 waitingRequests.reject                 alertYour session has expired. Sorry.                                 put the current request into the waiting queue     functionrequest          waitingRequests.donefunction               retry the request             .ajaxrequest              this   .ajaxSetupstatusCode      401 expiredTokenHandler  codepre  pThe mechanism works, the 401failed requests get fired a second time, the problem is their done callbacks do not get called, so the applications stalls.p

Negative 48 pIm writing an application that allows users to upload reference letters for potential employees.p  pEvery reference is sent an email containing a unique string at the end of the url.

Negative 48 pI am very new to programming. I am currently developing an iOS app that uses UIButtons to access different codeUIViewscode. Each one contains a codeUIScrollViewcode containing a codeUIImageViewcode. The purpose is to have a zoomable, scrollable and panable picture. I found a very good example of how to do all of these, but the code declares an image with  so I would have to create several codeUIViewscode and generate code for each to manage the specific codeUIImagecode because all have different names and codeUIScrollcode.

Negative 48 pIve a uitableview which shows images in each cell, which are downloaded online.p  pTo make this call async, I use NSBlockoperation. I prefer to use this, because i used GCD before but you cannot cancel GCD. The reason is that if I leave the view, the images gets downloaded at the background of the App, and when I get into the previous view again GCD would let it queue all again, so eventually there would be a whole stack of images and the user would never see the uitableview.

When I toggle them both off, the performance issues are resolved  However, I obviously dont want to just toggle them off p  pIm creating my shadows like sop  precodeself.imageView.layer.opaque  YES         self.imageView.layer.masksToBounds  NO         self.imageView.layer.shadowOffset  CGSizeMake4, 0         self.imageView.layer.shadowRadius  2.5         self.imageView.layer.shadowOpacity  0.15         self.imageView.layer.shadowPath  [UIBezierPath bezierPathWithRectCGRectMake                                                                                       self.bounds.origin.x,                                                                                       self.bounds.origin.y,                                                                                       self.bounds.size.width  8,                                                                                       self.bounds.size.height  2].CGPath codepre  pAny tips to improve the performancep  pAs far as antialiasing, it is almost a necessity.  The problem is that those offset pages are slightly rotated AND my pages have a 1 pixel border.  Slightly rotated with a 1 pixel border without antialiasing looks awful.  I am simply enabling antialiasing in the .plist by setting Renders with Edge Antialiasing to YES.p  pAny suggestions on how to improve my shadowantialiasing performance would be appreciated.p

Negative 48 pI have a BitBucket repository that contains a directory of Eclipse projects, and I am having trouble importing those projects into Eclipse.p  pThe files contained in the repository came from a Subversion repository. They were converted to a Git repository in the usual way, associated with the BitBucket repository using git clone , and the BitBucket repository was populated using git push u origin master. The Source tab of the repository in my BitBucket account shows all of the files that were contained in the original Subversion repository. To verify that the BitBucket repository was set up right, it did a git clone  to a different local directory and verified that the new directory had the same files as the directory from which the files were pushed to the BitBucket repository.p  pWithin this repository is a directory containing several Eclipse projects, and I need to import them into Eclipse. To do this, I installed the EGit plugin into Eclipse, switched to Eclipses Git Repositories view, clicked Clone a Git repository, entered the url of my BitBucket repository, specified my Workspace directory, and check a box labeled Import all existing projects after clone finishes. When the clone and import were finished, all of the Eclipse projects were displayed in Eclipses Package Explorer panel.p  pSome of the projects display all of their contents correctly, with a project folder containing, among other things, a src folder containing nested package folders that contained Java source files.p  pThe problem is with the other projects, which display a project folder with a greater than  sign between the folder icon and the project name, and a src folder with a greater than sign between the folder icon and the string src. This folder contains no package folders and no Java source files. Eclipse documentation and forums say that these  signs are displayed when a file has been changed since it was last synchronized with a repository although they mostly talk about these  signs being displayed for individual files, not for folders. I tried using the Eclipse command Team  Synchronize Workspace to make sure that the folders were synchronized, but it didnt change anything. Could anyone tell me what I did wrong along the way that prevents these projects from being imported into Eclipse correctlyp  pThanks,p  pMikep

Negative 48 pIm working on a project that uses a lot of detailed graphics.  Because of the amount of sprites, backgrounds, etc. displayed at all times, it has a large memory footprint.  We use cocos2D for the animations and sprites and UIKit for the UI, menus, etc.  p  pI would like to be able to reduce memory usage on iPod Touches which have less memory than the equivalent iPhones by forcing UIKit to use standard resolution images if the device is an iPod Touch with retina display.  Im able to set a flag in cocos2d the forces loading of SD images, but I havent found a similar option or workaround for UIKit.p  pSo to summarize, the project is a universal binary that has all images in both SD and retina flavors, like thisp  pimage.pngp  pimage2x.pngp  pOn iPhone 4, 4S, and 5 all with retina displays the default UIKit behavior of loading the 2x version of the images is desired.p  pOn iPod Touch 4th gen and possibly 5th gen I would like to force UIKit to load the SD image.png files, even though there are image2x.png files available as well.p  pThis is to reduce memory footprint on these devices that have retina displays, but half the RAM as the phones.p  pIf anyone has any ideas or workarounds to enable this, Id really appreciate itp

Negative 48 pFrom time to time we have encountered a very strange encoding problem in Tomcat in our production environment. p  pI have not yet been able to pinpoint exactly where in the code the problem happens, but it involves the replacement of non ascii characters to approximated ascii characters. p  pFor example replacing the character  with a.  Since the site is in swedish, the characters ,  and  is quite common. But for some reason the replacement of the  character always works, so a string like Kp inte grisen i scken becomes Kop inte grisen i scken, ie the  is not replaced as it should, while the  character is.p  pSome quick facts about the problemp  ul lipIt happens very seldom we have noticed it 34 times, the first time maybe 12 years ago.pli lipA restart of the troubled server makes the problem go away until the next time.pli lipIt has never occured on more then one front end server at the same time.pli lipIt doesnt always happen on the same front end server.pli lipNo user input on the front end is involved.pli lipAll front end servers connect to the same CMS and DB, with the relevant config being identical.pli lipAll front end servers have the same relevant configuration linux config, tomcat config, java environment config like file.encoding etc, and are started using the same script all according to the hostingservice provider.pli lipAll front end servers use the same exact war file for the site, and the same jar files.pli lipNo other encoding problems can be seen on the site while this character replacement problem occurs.pli lipWe have never been able to reproduce the problem in any other environment.pli ul  pWe use Tomcat 5.5 and Java 5, because of CMS requirements.p  pI can only think of two plausible causes for this behaivorp  ol lipThe hosting provider sometimes startsrestarts the front end servers in a different way, maybe with another user account with other environment variables or other file access rights, or maybe using some other script than the normal one.pli lipSome process running during Tomcat or webapp startup depends upon some other process, and sometimes intermittantly but seldom these two or more processes happen to run in an order that causes this encoding defect.pli ol  pBut even if 1 or 2 above is the case, it still doesnt explain fully what really happens. What exact difference could explain this Since all of file.encoding, file.encoding.pkg sun.io.unicode.encoding, sun.jnu.encoding and all other relevant environment variables all match on all front end machines verified visually using a debug page, while the problem was occuring.p  pCan someone think of some plausible explanation for this strange intermittent behaivor Simply upgrading Tomcat andor Java version is not really a relevant answer since we dont really know if that would solve the problem, and it still doesnt explain what the problem was. Im more interested in understanding exactly what the problem is caused by.p  pRegards Jimip  pemstrongUPDATEemstrongp  pI think I have found the code that performs the character replacements. On initiation triggered by the first call to do a replacement it builds a HashMapltCharacter, Stringgt, and fills it like this  p  precodelookup.putnew Character, a   codepre  pThen when it should replace characters for a String, it loops over each character and for each one does a lookup in the hash map with the charactar as the key, and if a replacement String is found it is used, otherwise the original character is used.  p  pThis part of the code is more then 3 years old, and written by a developer who is long gone. If I would rewrite this code today I would do something totally different, and that might even solve the problem. But it would still not explain exactly what happend.

Negative 48 pstrongUpdate Thanks for all the help guys, Ive decided to try and write my own PHP class for handling MySQL requests.strongp  pIm faced with a problem right now when Im trying to make the switch from codemysqlcode to codemysqlicode functions, in that I have literally tens of thousands of lines of PHPMySQL code and queries scattered across hundreds of files, and theyre all using functions such as codemysqlquerycode, codemysqlnumrowscode, codemysqlfetchassoccode, etc. Going through and changing these line by line even with findreplace to codemysqlicode functions with prepared statements and all is pain enough, but what if in the future PHP.net decides to release something else that will deprecate the codemysqlicode functionsp  pSo right now Im considering perhaps writing my own MySQL library is that what you would call it that calls the codemysqlicode functions and including it in all my files. This way, if I needed to change something else in the future, theoretically I could change the function in my library once and changes would be reflected on all pages, instead of manually going through and changing everything by hand. p  pWould this be a good idea I found something online called a hrefhttpwww.meekro.com relnofollowMeekroDBa, but first of all Im not sure if its what Im looking for and second of all theyre charging 50 to use this commercially which I want to do. Are there other free solutions, or would I just be wasting my timep  pAny commentsfeedback is appreciated p  pstrongEditstrong In case this wasnt clear, its not as if Im making a connection to my database in every file that Im making queries to database. I have a functions.php file that I use to connect to the MySQL database and I codeincludecode that file in all my other files. My question is more related to functions such as codemysqlquerycode, codemysqlnumrowscode, and codemysqlfetchassoccode. p

Negative 48 pYou are a plane tracking an enemy ship that travels across the ocean, so you have collected a series of x,y,time coordinates of the ship. You know that a hidden submarine travels with the ship to protect it, but while there is a correlation between their positions, the submarine often wanders off from the ship, so while its often near it, it can also be on the other side of the world occasionally. You want to predict the path of the submarine, but unfortunately it is hidden from you.p  pBut one month in April you notice the submarine forgets to hide itself, so you have a series of coordinates for both the submarine and the ship throughout 1,000 trips. Using this data, youd like to build a model to predict the hidden submarines path given just the ships movements. The naive baseline would be to say submarine position guess  ships current position but from the April data where the submarine was visible, you notice there is a tendency for the submarine to be ahead of the ship a bit, so submarine position guess  ships position in 1 minute is an even better estimate. Furthermore, the April data shows that when the ship pauses in the water for an extended period, the submarine is likely to be far away patrolling the coastal waters. There are other patterns of course.p  pHow would you build this model, given the April data as training data, to predict the submarines path My current solution is an adhoc linear regression where the factors are trip time, cargo ships x coordinate, was cargo ship idle for 1 day, etc. and then having R figure out the weights and doing a crossvalidation. But I would really love a way to generate these factors automatically from the April data. Also, a model that uses sequence or time would be nice, since the linear regression doesnt and I think its relevant.p  pEdit Ive reformulated the problem with a madeup story so its a less confusing. The original problem I posted isp  pI have eyetracking data on two subjects  a teacher, and a student. Its in the form x, y, time, so there is a series of these for each subject. What the teacher looks at influences what the student looks at. What method would I use to predict what the student is looking at, using only teacher data Lets say I can train some learning algorithm using a gold standard set of student and teacher data.p  pI was thinking hidden markov model would be appropriate, given the definition in Wikipedia, but I am not sure how to put this into practice over my dataset.p  pMore detail I have data about how a teacher and student each look at a map and some readings. I have 40 of these datasets, which look like [366,234,0, 386,234,5, ...] which means the teacher looked at point 366,234 at time 0 and then 5 seconds later moved up to look at coordinate 386, 234. I can to learn a model to understand the relationship between how a teacher looks at content, to predict how a student will look at the same content. So maybe the student looks at the content in the same order as the teacher but slower. Or perhaps the student doesnt look around as much but the teacher scans more of the content. I have both sets of data and want to see how accurate of a model I can get  would I be able to predict the students looking behavior within 50px of the teachers looking behaviorp

Negative 48 pIm newbie to Spring AOP. I do understand the concept behind it and i also do understand the concept of Before or After etc usage. What i am so confused is still the usage of Spring AOP.

Heres my questions   p  ol lipIf i were to implement the above method using Spring AOP, this logger will be removed but then does Spring AOP able to capture this log message from what i know Spring AOP does not look inside a method    pli lipIf answer to clause 1 is yes then how is it donepli lipIf answer is no whats the point of using Spring AOP. Usage of Before is useless unless you want to capture the information like parameters prior to execution of the method. Most of the time we want to capture some log inside a method itself.pli ol  pForget about AspectJ. I do know that AspectJ can do the above job. I just want to know whats the point of using Spring AOP if it cannot do the very fundamental thing of capturing logs inside a method.p  pAny help is appreciated.p  hr  pFurther notep  pI assume after implementating Spring AOP the above code would be like this. The logger call is no longer in the test method since it will be taken care of by the aspect class.

Negative 48 h2My Approach while INSERTing INTO MySqlh2  pI think I read in stackoverflow.com that if you need escaping or similar action, do it just in time you need so in the verification pages that I verify the user inputs null or not check, length check and structural checks eg mail structure, custom tags structures I use the codePOST[]code variables as inputs. During verifications, even in the custom error printing parts, my error messages does not include any of codePOST[]code values in message texts.br br  As an interim note I utilize strongprepared statements and parameterized queriesstrong during phpMySql interactions. If inputs are verified just before INSERTing INTO MySql, I strongstrip the tags from inputstrong since I dont allow any html tags other than custom structured tags. for example codebold text  ltstronggtbold textltstronggtcode Then I insert the user input into MySql db.p  h2My Approach while fetching from MySql amp printing the output to the screenh2  pI only apply htmlspecialchars command to print out to the screen from MySql dbp  h2My Questionh2  pI am not sure of myself.

Negative 48 pI am fairly new to Domain driven design but what I uderstand of it is that you speak to the application service, which is the entry to your model.

This works fine but at the moment, on refresh they change to my themes colour by applying them to the the to css where necessary examples below.p  pI now have a jQuery function for hover states which animates and all my linkhover states they are included in the colour shuffle. When the colour shuffle is applied though its the default red,blue,green if you were to put them in the css.p  pI have had a look online but i am unsure of where else to look as it is working just not on the jQuery snippet so i assume its something to do with the jQuery function.p  pPHP at top of headerp  precodeltphp colours  arrayred, yellow, pink, blue, green  shufflecolours  random  colours[0] gt codepre  pOn the body tag its echoed as an idp  precodeltbody idltphp echo random gtgt codepre  pLink codeltscript typetextjavascript srcajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjqueryui1.10.0jqueryui.min.jsgtltscriptgtcodep  pAnd on any divs or elements i want them to change colour before them in the css is green,red ect and the colour so if i wanted the share class  to change my css is like thisp  precodegreen .share      color79b74c  red .share      color900  codepre  pNow this all works apart from my hover shuffle states with the jQuery functionp  precodedocument.readyfunction      colour rollover navigation     .share.hoverfunction         this.stop.animate color ltphp echo random gt , 300     ,function         this.stop.animate color fff , 300      codepre  pIt must be something to do with the jQuery as it works well when its removed, and does work when applied but its taking the colours from the php as csss default colour hex codes.p  pThanks.p

Negative 48 pOn some printers, for whatever reason, the printouts are automatically enlarged with what seems to be default settings when printing through the Java JVM Java 7.

Negative 48 pHas anyone had a successful attempt at a Ruby on Rails install for SLES11 Ive attempted to install a copy of Ruby2.0 and Rails4.0 using RVM but had all sorts of difficulties with dependencies and it makes me wonder if RVM is truly compatible with the SLES11 version of Linux.p  pIm running SLES11 SP2 with all the available repositoriesto my knowledge but have been largely unsuccessful at several variations of an install usually due to package requirements and dependency issues.

Negative 48 pIm developing machine learning algorithms which classify images based on training data.p  pDuring the image preprocessing stages, there are several parameters which I can modify that affect the data I feed my algorithms for example, I can change the Hessian Threshold when extracting SURF features. So the flow thus far looks likep  p[param1, param2, param3...]  [black box]  accuracy p  pMy problem is strongwith so many parameters at my disposal, how can I systematically pick values which give me optimized resultsaccuracystrong A naive approach is to run i nested forloops assuming i parameters and just iterate through all parameter combinations, but if it takes 5 minute to calculate an accuracy from my black box system this would take a long, long time.p  pThis being said, are there any algorithms or techniques which can search for optimal parameters in a black box system I was thinking of taking a course in Discrete Optimization but Im not sure if that would be the best use of my time.p  pThank you for your time and helpp  pstrongEditstrong to answer comments I have 58 parameters. Each parameter has its own range. One parameter can be 01000 integer, while another can be 0 to 1 real number. Nothing is stopping me from multithreading the black box evaluation.p  pAlso, there are some parts of the black box that have some randomness to them. For example, one stage is using kmeans clustering. Each black box evaluation, the cluster centers may change. I run kmeans several times to hopefully avoid local optima. In addition, I evaluate the black box multiple times and find the median accuracy in order to further mitigate randomness and outliers.p

Negative 48 pThanks in advance for your help. I have to do a task on my office computer which means I cant install any additional software, so I think a batch file might be the easiest way to do this even if its not the most efficient although I welcome other solutions that I might be able to do without installing software on my office computer. Also, please keep in mind that I have very little programming experience in your answers p  pBasically, I have a folder with a series of subfolders in it, each of these full of files of various types text, emails, textbased pdfs, word docs. I also have a text file or an excel column with hundreds of email addresses in it. I want to use a batch file or similar method to run through each email address in the list and search against the contents of the various files in each folder like Windows Search does. Files which contain the search phrase should automatically be moved to a prespecified folder possibly having to be renamed or put in a new subfolder as many of these files might have the same name. In the end, we should have one folder as well as its subfolders which contains no files which have any of the email addresses from the list in their contents, and another folder which only has files that has content containing the email addresses in their files these can be in subfolders, or renamed, or whatever is most convenient, just not deleted.p  pSince the list of email addresses is in Excel, another option I could entertain would be using some sort of VBA macro if that is capable of searching the contents of files within a folder recursively.p  pI hope that this makes sense and Im happy to clarify if it doesnt. Again, thanks for any help you can providep

Negative 48 pIm having an issue with getting my doctrine entity to extract to my ZF2 form. Im fairly new to both ZF2 and Doctrine as well as class table inheritance. Ive read through practically all of the ZF2 and Doctrine documentation, but still cant seem to figure out how to get this working.p  pTo briefly explain the system, there is a main entity called Policy. The Policy entity includes a Proposer entity and a PolicyProduct entity, as well as a couple of other columns.p  pI am using Class Table Inheritance in the PolicyProduct entity, as I have 3 different product types, each with different data required. The 3 product entities are TouringCaravan, StaticCaravan and Parkhome.p  pThe Policy entity can only have 1 Proposer and 1 PolicyProduct.p  pAll entities have getter and setter methods for each column.p  pThe form im displaying includes fields from both the Policy entity and the PolicyProduct entity. p  pTo display the form, i first get the Policy entity and Policy Fieldset. And then set the Policy Fieldset as the base.p  precodepolicyEntity  entityManagergtgetRepositoryPolicyEntityPolicygtfindpolicyId policyFieldset  formElementManagergtgetpolicyformpolicyfieldset policyFieldsetgtsetUseAsBaseFieldsettrue codepre  pI then get the PolicyProduct specific fieldset and add it to the policyFieldset.p  precodeeg productFieldset  formElementManagergtgettourersformtouringfieldset policyFieldsetgtaddproductFieldset codepre  pI then add the policyFieldset to the form, bind it with the Policy entity, and return the completed form.p  precodeproductFormgtaddpolicyFieldset productFormgtbindpolicyEntity return productForm codepre  pTo note, i am using the codeDoctrineModuleStdlibHydratorDoctrineObject as DoctrineHydratorcode as my hydrator for each fieldset. I then call the following inside the  codeinitcode method of each fieldset.p  precode Example from PolicyFieldset hydrator  new DoctrineHydratorthisgtobjectManager,true  thisgtsetHydratorhydrator      gtsetObjectnew Policy codepre  pIf i complete the form and save to the database, i can see that the data is stored correctly in the tables. If i then try to hydrate the same form with the entity, none of the PolicyProduct Entity values are mapped. The values in the Policy Entity are hydrated correctly though.p  pIf i dump out codepolicyEntitygtgetPolicyProductcode i can see all the data, which means that the entity is correctly saving and retrieving the information, the problem appears to be when i try to extract the entity data to the form fieldset.p  pI hope this makes sense, but let me know if not and ill try to clarify.p  pThanksp  hr  pHere are the main entitiesp  pPolicyp  precodenamespace PolicyEntity  use DoctrineORMMapping as ORM    ORMEntity  ORMTablenamepolicy  class Policy            ORMId      ORMColumntypeinteger      ORMGeneratedValuestrategyAUTO          protected id            ORMManyToOnetargetEntityProposerEntityProposer, inversedBypolicy      ORMJoinColumnnameproposerid, referencedColumnNameid          protected proposer            ORMManyToOnetargetEntityProduct      ORMJoinColumnnameproductid, referencedColumnNameid, onDeleteRESTRICT          protected product            ORMOneToOnetargetEntityPolicyEntityPolicyProduct      ORMJoinColumnnamepolicyproductid, referencedColumnNameid          protected policyProduct            ORMManyToOnetargetEntityPolicyStatus      ORMJoinColumnnamepolicystatusid, referencedColumnNameid, onDeleteRESTRICT          protected policyStatus            ORMColumnnamepolicyInception, typedate, nullabletrue          protected policyInception       Omitted getters and setters   codepre  pPolicyProductp  precodenamespace PolicyEntity  use DoctrineORMMapping as ORM    ORMEntity  ORMTablenamepolicyproduct  ORMInheritanceTypeJOINED  ORMDiscriminatorColumnnameproductDiscriminator, typeinteger  ORMDiscriminatorMap1  TourersEntityTouringCaravan, 2  StaticsEntityStaticCaravan, 3  ParkhomesEntityParkhome   class PolicyProduct             ORMId      ORMColumntypeinteger      ORMGeneratedValuestrategyAUTO          protected id       Omitted getters and setters  codepre  pTouringCaravan  example of a PolicyProduct Inherited Tablep  precodenamespace TourersEntity  use DoctrineORMMapping as ORM use PolicyEntityPolicyProduct    ORMEntity  ORMTablenametouringcaravan   class TouringCaravan extends PolicyProduct             ORMId      ORMColumntypeinteger      ORMGeneratedValuestrategyAUTO          protected id            ORMOneToOnetargetEntityPolicyEntityPolicy      ORMJoinColumnnamepolicyid, referencedColumnNameid          protected policy            ORMManyToOnetargetEntityTouringCaravanMake      ORMJoinColumnnametouringcaravanmake, referencedColumnNameid, onDeleteRESTRICT          protected caravanMake            ORMColumnnamecaravanModel, typestring, length128, uniquefalse, nullablefalse          protected caravanModel      ....

When Im ready to integrate to the master branch I checkout master and call codegit merge ltmy branchgtcode then push to the repository.p  pBut with pull requests do I need to take that last step  Instead, can I submit a pull request on my branch and then on GitHub apply it to master p  pIm also open to improvements on my existing workflow, if any are apparent.p

However, the way the shiny is rendering the page, both elements end up emoutsideem of the tablep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0PBMG.png altenter image description herep  pstrongIs it possible and if yes, then how to update the table header and body separately in Shinystrongp  pShort explanation why Im not using the default xtable or dataTable I have a very large data frame in R, so I dont want to use dataTable. Filtering, searching, sorting and paging should all be done on the server side. However, as I want to have all these nice gimmicks, I need to reimplement data frame to HTML table conversion. I run into a problem with radio buttons in the table header  when the table is redisplayed, the buttons are reset and trigger another event. The easiest solution also, more elegant would be to render the table body separately from the table head.p
Negative 48 pIn my Qt Application Im facing the following scenario When a specific event is raised I show a modeless codeQDialogcode which asks the user for a confirmation. The Dialog is showed using codeshowcode function from a codeQMainWindowcode. Anytime the event is raised and no other modal codeQDialogcode are shown, the user is able to click the confirmation button. Unfortunately if a modal codeQDialogcode is visible when the event is raised, the modeless codeQDialogcode is unaccessible. This means that the user cannot click the confirmation button. The following code is a simplified version that causes the same problem In this example the codeQMainWindowcode contains a button, when the button is clicked a modal codeQDialogcode is shown using the codeexeccode function in the meanwhile a codeQTimercode has been started. Anytime I close the modal codeQDialogcode before the codeQTimercode is elapsed the modeless dialog is accesible. If I wait until the modeless dialog is shown without closing the modal one, the modeless dialog is inaccessible I need to close the modal one first.p  pMainWindows codep  precodeinclude mainwindow.h include uimainwindow.h  MainWindowMainWindowQWidget parent      QMainWindowparent,     uinew UiMainWindow      uigtsetupUithis     mpModeless  new DialogModalthis     connectampmqTimer,SIGNALtimeout,this,SLOTTimerElapsed    MainWindowMainWindow      delete mpModeless     delete ui    void MainWindowTimerElapsed      mqTimer.stop     mpModelessgtshow     mpModelessgtactivateWindow     mpModelessgtraise     mpModelessgtsetFocus   void MainWindowonpbStartTestclicked      mqTimer.start10000     DialogModal dthis     d.exec  codepre  pMainWindow Headerp  precodeifndef MAINWINDOWH define MAINWINDOWH  include ltQMainWindowgt include ltQTimergt include dialogmodal.h  namespace Ui  class MainWindow   class MainWindow  public QMainWindow      QOBJECT  public     explicit MainWindowQWidget parent  0     MainWindow     QTimer mqTimer     DialogModal mpModeless private     UiMainWindow ui private slots     void TimerElapsed     void onpbStartTestclicked   endif  MAINWINDOWH codepre  pDialogModal Headerp  precodeifndef DIALOGMODALH define DIALOGMODALH  include ltQDialoggt  namespace Ui  class DialogModal   class DialogModal  public QDialog      QOBJECT  public     explicit DialogModalQWidget parent  0     DialogModal  private slots     void onpbExitclicked  private     UiDialogModal ui   endif  DIALOGMODALH codepre  pDialogModal sourcep  precodeinclude dialogmodal.h include uidialogmodal.h  DialogModalDialogModalQWidget parent      QDialogparent,     uinew UiDialogModal      uigtsetupUithis   DialogModalDialogModal      delete ui   void DialogModalonpbExitclicked      close  codepre  pIs there anyway to give focus to the modeless dialog even when one or more modal dialog are presentp

Negative 48 pUnlike a dumb pointer, I would expect that I could create a codeQSharedPointercode on the stack in a function and then return it as return value for assignment to another codeQSharedPointercode of the same type, right Normally, such a pointer would point to memory that is now out of scope and therefore the pointer is not valid, but a codeQSharedPointercode will ensure it is retained in memory if another copy of it remains, I would expect.

Negative 48 pIm developing a specific part of my website which uses a sales report where my userclient can consult it from. It generates a report ordered by date and builds it dynamically with JQUERY AND PHP.p  pAfter that its enabled options such as print and generate PDF. The print part its already done and working perfectly but Im having troubles with PDF generation part because I have to give as option 2 types of model for choosing.p  pFirst model is ok, despite it uses several lines on it, I still can manage it to generate as PDF using FPDF which is faster just because those lines is all in a certain pattern. I mean, its always the same, the only difference would be the number of registers requested.p  pBut the problem here is the second model which is totally variable even on columns making it hard to work with FPDF I would have to build it line per line and that is unviablep  pIve already tried several classes of converters from HTML to PDF like DOMPDF, HTML2PDF, MPDF but they take a very long time processing when its requested for big period of time for example.p  pSo lets jump for my help request p  pOr generate and save it in server while the user is searching for a specific period of time and when he clicks on model 2 it will be already generated hell just get a link to a folder to download it directly.p  pAny idea or solution is welcome, I dont care if it will be hard to implement it.p  pIve found some APIs with DocRaptor that suits very well, good and fast but its paid and this is unviable for me.p

I dont have the experience I need and Im just not finding any resources that answer this question.p  pHeres the little CPU Im working on, I skipped the RAM class and instruction class, the ram class is basically just a contiguous memory block, and the instruction class just has a function pointer in it not the fastest method Im sure, but Im learningp  precodeconst int REGNUM  8 class cpu     protected         ui16 reg[REGNUM]registers should change to unions         ram prampipeline pointer to ram         vectorltmodulegt addons         instruction itable[255]can make vector if more than 255 instructions         byte inum current number of instructions in the itable, increments when instruction added     public      cpu     cpu      void connectramram inramreset instruction pointer     void connectmodulemodule addon anything from a hard drive to a screen      ram getram      byte addinstructionconst instructionamp ins      void setregui8 which, ui16 val     ui16 getregui8 which      void exe run execution unit, increment instruction pointer  cpucpu     inum0     pramNULL     forint a  0 altREGNUM a         reg[a]0        void cpuconnectramram inram     praminram     reg[7]0  void cpuconnectmodulemodule addon     addons.pushbackaddon  ram cpugetram     return pram  void cpusetregui8 which, ui16 val     reg[which]val  ui16 cpugetregui8 which     return reg[which]  void cpuexe     itable[getram[getreg7]].functhis  byte cpuaddinstructionconst instructionamp ins     itable[inum]ins     inum     return inum1 return table num of instruction   void jmpcpu c can depend on architecture, 16 bit jump different than 8 bit     ui16 ins  cgtgetram[cgtgetreg7  1]next byte     ins  ins ltlt 8     ins   cgtgetram[cgtgetreg7  2]second next byte     cgtsetreg7,ins   void outputcpu c outputs the first register     cout ltlt charcgtgetreg0     cgtsetreg7,cgtgetreg71   void getramcpu c     ui16 ad  ui16cgtgetram[cgtgetreg7  1]ltlt8ui16cgtgetram[cgtgetreg72]     cgtsetreg0,cgtgetram[ad] set register 1 to the value of the address     cgtsetreg7,cgtgetreg73 move instruction pointer   void setramcpu c     ui16 ad  ui16cgtgetram[cgtgetreg7  1]ltlt8ui16cgtgetram[cgtgetreg72] address to change     cgtgetram[ad]  cgtgetreg0 set byte at address to value in first register     cgtsetreg7,cgtgetreg73 move instruction pointer   void incregcpu c     cgtsetreg0,cgtgetreg01     cgtsetreg7,cgtgetreg71  void decregcpu c     cgtsetreg0,cgtgetreg01     cgtsetreg7,cgtgetreg73   void nopcpu c     cgtsetreg7,cgtgetreg71 move instruction pointer  codepre
Negative 48 pI was just doing some reading about Web Forms security and why security checks should not be done only on the first page load, because its possible to spoof a postback and get around this checkp  precodeif IsPostBack      if IsUserInRoleSomeRole               do something        codepre  pSo then I thought, would that still be true if the markup hides something by default, and the security check simply enables itp  pMarkupp  precodeltaspButton IDbtnUpdate runatserver TextUpdate Visiblefalse gt codepre  pCodeBehindp  precodeif IsPostBack      if IsUserInRoleSomeRole              btnUpdate.Visible  true        codepre  pThe thinking there is that on the first page load if someone has permission to see the update button, they can, and the visibility state would be saved in ViewState for subsequent postbacks, making it redundant to check it every time. Even if someone managed to spoof a postback, they still wouldnt be able to see the Update button, so they gain nothing.p  pSo the question is Is it possible for someone to not only spoof a postback, but also successfully modify the ViewState so that they can see something they shouldnt be able to If yes, it seems we would have to change the above codebehind to not use the IsPostBack check and handle both cases, regardless of what the default is in the markupp  precodeif IsUserInRoleSomeRole      btnUpdate.Visible  true  else      btnUpdate.Visible  false  codepre  pBut that seems like overkill. Though admittedly it doesnt seem as bad if you rewrite it asp  precodebtnUpdate.Visible  IsUserInRoleSomeRole codepre  pSo again, is this really necessaryp

Negative 48 pIve started using REMs to size certain elements on a page so that I can easily adjust their size across the board just by modifying the fontsize on the root html element useful for media queries. However, Ive noticed an issue in desktop webkit browsers where the elements will resize to match any fontsize above 50, but not any further below.p  pa hrefhttpjsbin.comyapaviqu1edithtml,css,output relnofollowYou can see an example of it happening on this pagea showing off the technique of sizing elements with REMs. Ive also included the example code below.p  pHTMLp  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt     ltmeta charsetutf8gt     lttitlegtJS Binlttitlegt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltdiv classblockgtltdivgt      ltpgtSample Textltpgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pCSS p  precodehtml fontsize 62.5 p fontsize 2rem .block background yellow width 10em height 10em  media minwidth 600px html fontsize 70 media minwidth 700px html fontsize 80 media maxwidth 400px html fontsize 50 media maxwidth 300px html fontsize 40 media maxwidth 200px html fontsize 30 codepre  pYou can see the box, which is set at 10rem at fontsize 62.5, render at 100px square. As you scale up the base fontsize via media queries, the box gets bigger as expected. The box also shrinks down to fontsize 50, but any value below that, the box never gets smaller than 50.

Negative 48 pIm exploring various ways to do c, vb.net fused projects. What I love about c is that you can load up a bunch of binary data, give it a pointer with the appropriate type and bam You have yourself a pod object instance.p  pIm looking a way to do the same in vb.net but Im rather fuzzy on the way vb.net handles its memory. Basically, is there a way to convert binary data into an object without too much overhead in a manner that the exact same data would also be viable in c and its equivalent class definition Further more, could you do that to binary data in another processes memory or perhaps shared memory without moving the actual data so that if both c and vb.net programs object instances point to the same chunk of memory, if one changes the data, the other one is instantly up to date toop

Negative 48 pI have two solutions, solution1 containing project1 which generates a source file that is compiled into solution2 having project2. You just build and run solution1, then build and run solution2.p  pSome of my team members are complaining about the usability of this, so, ive put both projects in one solution, and set them both to run multiple startup projects. I put a prebuild step in project2 to wait for project1 to finish running, so project2 will be build with the latest code generated when project1 runs. p  pThe trouble is, it doesnt work Visual studio builds project1, and project 2 is waiting for it to finish running because then the code project2 needs is generated by project1. But Visual Studio apparently doesnt run any of the projects until they are all done building, so this wait for project1 keeps project2 from building by design but also keeps project1 from running although it wouldnt have to. p  pIs there any way to get around this and perform the functionality I want, or a codearoundworkaround p

Negative 48 pIm question is pretty much the same as the one below, except I can reproduce with the Microsoft samples. InstallPackage Microsoft.AspNet.Identity.Samples Prep  pIf you install this package and then profile using MiniProfiler youll notice that each time you do an operation related to users, duplicate statements are sent to SQL Server. It calls FindByIdAsync multiple times which in turn makes calls to the database.p  pBy wrapping the ApplicationUserManager and DataContext in CreatePerOwinContext, it should only send the SQL once within the same request and not multiple times. I have no idea why this is happening. Below is a similar question which may assist in getting an answer, but as I said can reproduce with the sample code.p  pa hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions24111679createidentityasynccallingfindbyidasyncmultipletimesCreateIdentityAsync calling FindByIdAsync multiple timesap

Negative 48 pSo I have a non blocking OTP socket server very similar to the one in Learn Yorself Some Erlangp  pa hrefhttplearnyousomeerlang.combucketsofsockets relnofollowhttplearnyousomeerlang.combucketsofsocketsap  pThe supervisor passes the listening socket to dynamically spawned genservers, each of which can accept a single connection in this way the listening socket isnt blocked by blocking calls to gentcpaccept, and each genserver spawned by the supervisor effectively represents a single client.p  pNow this is all very nice and I can talk to the server via telnet, a simple echo handler echoing my requests.p  pBut what if I want to extend this into a simple chat server  Obvious thing missing here is the ability to send a broadcast message to all connected clients. But currently none of the genserver clients know about the existence of any of the others p  pWhats a sensible OTP compliant pattern for one genserver to be able to get pids for all the others  Only way I can think of is to have some kind of mnesiaets table containing pidsusernames as part of the genserver state variable, but somehow this doesnt seem very OTP like.p  pThoughts p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 48 pI have a Stored Procedure, MS SQL Server, one of the columns returned is a string, yes or no.  So far, so good.

If I call codewriteOutputSP suitable text  amp spResults.rgsuitabletext[i]code on the output of the SP, and this is a computed value, not an actual column with an actual datatype in TSQL, it writes what it should, ie yes or no.  However, in constructing an array to be serialized as JSON, codergsuitabletextspResults.rgsuitabletext[i]code and so on, if I use a REST client for Google or Firefox and view just the raw JSON output from ColdFusion, it shows truefalse.

Negative 48 pCan anyone offer advice on how to make styling adjustments to my products on the shop page I find that they are too close together and Id like to space them out a bit. Also, the product titles, being of different lengths, creates a bit of a chaotic appearance where the Add to cart buttons are not positioned uniformly on a straight line. Obviously, this is caused by the varying length product titles and the ratings element. I just need to know what function to look in to style these elements. The site itself is just a test.

Negative 48 pMy situation  In my application I am creating I have a form with a few inputs and a submit button.  When I click the submit button I want to disable all input fields, while retaining all data.p  pMy problem  I know to disable all input fields I would just .propdisabled, true to all of the applicable fields. However, I noticed that when I disable the fields the data is still visible, but in code the value for that element is emnullem. p  pExamplep  precodeNewPolicyNumber.val102452154 has value of input 102452154 NewPolicyNumber.propdisabled, truedisables the element codepre  pWhen you look at the value of NewPolicyNumber it is now null.  I cant seem to find much information on this particular problem when searching online.  Why does it make the value of the element null  Also, how to I remedy this, so I can have a disabled element that will retain its inputted valuep  pThank youp

Negative 48 pI am using Yii 1.x with the selgridview extension which simply remembers selected rows when sorting or paging.

Negative 48 pI am writing a program that reads information from a device through the serial port. I have a list of available devices in a datagrid. When the user clicks on a row, it fetches information from the device and displays it in a separate list. It usually takes about a second for the device to respond and the information to populate. However, during this second, the datagrid row does not highlight as selected. So it takes about a second from the time the mouse clicks on the datagrid row for it to actually show as highlightedselected.p  pI thought a background worker thread would be the best thing to use for this, but I get the same results with the code below.

The class overloads some operators for addition, subtraction and multiplication with codefloatcode.p  pThe filters biquad mostly and the reverb works with floats and doesnt use this class but the hermite interpolator and every multiplication and addition for volume controll and mixing uses the class. p  pDoes this has an impact on the performance and would it be better to work with left and right sample directly p  pstrong2 stdfunctionstrongp  pThe callback function from the audio IO libary PortAudio calls a stdfunction. I use this to encapsulation everything related to PortAudio. So the user sets his own callback function with stdbindp  precodestdbind  ampAudioControllerprocessAudio,              ampthis,              stdplaceholders1,              stdplaceholders2 codepre  pSince for every callback, the right function has to be found from the CPU however this works..., does this have an impact and would it be better to define a class the user has to inherit fromp  pstrong3 virtual functionsstrongp  pI use a class called codeAudioProcessorcode which declares a virtual functionp  precodevirtual void tickFrame buffer, int frameCout  0 codepre  pThis function always processes a number of frames at once. Depending on the drive, 200 frames up to  1000 frames per call. Within the signal processing path, I call this function 6 time from multiple derivated classes. I remember that this is done with lookup tables so the CPU knows exactly which function it has to call. So does the process of calling a virtual derivated function  has an impact on the performancep  pThe nice thing about this is the structure in the source code but only using inlines maybe would have an performance improvement.p  pThese are all questions for now. I have some more about Qts event loop because I think that my GUI uses quite a bit of CPU time as well. But this is another topic I guess. p  pThanks in advancep  hr  pThese are all relevant function calls within the signal processing. Some of them are from the STK libary. The biquad functions are from STK and should perform fine. This goes for the freeverb algorithm as well.p  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecode  AudioController Function  void AudioControllerprocessAudioint frameCount, float output       CALCULATE LEFT TRACK      Frame  leftFrameBuffer  Frame output      ifleftLoaded   the left processor is loaded         leftProcessorgttickleftFrameBuffer, frameCount   TrackProcessortick      else          forint i  0 i lt frameCount i              leftFrameBuffer[i].leftSample   0.0f             leftFrameBuffer[i].rightSample  0.0f                     CALCULATE RIGHT TRACk      ifrightLoaded   the right processor is loaded          the rightFrameBuffer is allocated once and ensured to have enough space for frameCount Frames         rightProcessorgttickrightFrameBuffer, frameCount TrackProcessortick      else          forint i  0 i lt frameCount i              rightFrameBuffer[i].leftSample   0.0f             rightFrameBuffer[i].rightSample  0.0f                     MIX     forint i  0 i lt frameCount i           leftFrameBuffer[i]  volume  leftRightMix  leftFrameBuffer[i]  1.0  leftRightMix  rightFrameBuffer[i]          AudioController Function   void TrackProcessortickFrame frames, int frameNum      ifbufferLoaded ampamp playback          forint i  0 i lt frameNum i               read from buffer             frames[i]   bufferPlayergttick               filter coeffs             caltulateFilterCoeffslowCutoffFiltergttick, highCutoffFiltergttick               filter             frames[i].leftSample  lpFilterLgttickhpFilterLgttickframes[i].leftSample             frames[i].rightSample  lpFilterRgttickhpFilterRgttickframes[i].rightSample               else          forint i  0 i lt frameNum i                       frames[i]  Frame0,0                     Effect 1, Equalizer     ifeffsActive[0]          insEffProcessors[0]gttickframes, frameNum           Effect 2, Reverb     ifeffsActive[1]          insEffProcessors[1]gttickframes, frameNum            Volume     forint i  0 i lt frameNum i          frames[i].leftSample   volume         frames[i].rightSample  volume          Equalizer   void EqualizerProcessortickFrame frames, int frameNum      ifactive          Frame lowCross         Frame highCross          forint f  0 f lt frameNum f               lowAmp  lowAmpFiltergttick             midAmp  midAmpFiltergttick             highAmp  highAmpFiltergttick              lowCross   highLPFgttickframes[f]             highCross  highHPFgttickframes[f]              frames[f]  lowAmp  lowLPFgtticklowCross                         midAmp  lowHPFgtticklowCross                         highAmp  lowAPFgttickhighCross                   Reverb   This function just calls the stkFreeVerb tick function for every frame  The FreeVerb implementation cant realy be optimised so I will take it as it is.  void ReverbProcessortickFrame frames, int frameNum      ifactive          forint i  0 i lt frameNum i              frames[i].leftSample  reverbgttickframes[i].leftSample, frames[i].rightSample             frames[i].rightSample  reverbgtlastOut1                   Buffer Playback BufferPlayer   Frame BufferPlayertick       adjust read position based on loop status     ifinLoop          whilereadPos gt loopEndPos              readPos  loopStartPos  readPos  loopEndPos                     int x1   readPos     float t  readPos  x1      Frame f  interpolatebuffergtframeAtx11,                            buffergtframeAtx1,                           buffergtframeAtx11,                           buffergtframeAtx12,                           t      readPos  stepSize     return f    interpolation Frame BufferPlayerinterpolateFrame x0, Frame x1, Frame x2, Frame x3, float t      Frame c0  x1     Frame c1  0.5f  x2  x0     Frame c2  x0  2.5f  x1  2.0f  x2  0.5f  x3     Frame c3  0.5f  x3  x0  1.5f  x1  x2     return c3  t  c2  t  c1  t  c0    inline Frame BufferPlayerframeAtint pos      ifpos lt 0          pos  0      else if pos gt frames          pos  frames 1            get chunk and relative Sample     int chunk  posChunkSize     int chunkSample  posChunkSize      return FrameleftChunks[chunk][chunkSample], rightChunks[chunk][chunkSample]   codepre

It returns the number of distinct records in the set of 12 defined by the codeLIMITcode, codeOFFSETcode and codeORDERcode parameters. p  pFor example if the codePlaylistshipscode between codeidcode13 and codeidcode24 had codeplaylistidscode of [2,3,3,5,6,3,5,6,8,11,12,12], then this query will only give return 7 records, corresponding to the first ones having the codeplaylistidscode [2,3,5,6,8,11,12].p  pWhat I would like to find is a query that yields 12, records with distinct codeplaylistidscode, with the correct offset so that running this query again with an codeOFFSETcode of 3 would yield the next 12 records with distinct codeplaylistidscode.p  pHopefully I didnt over explain this one, as I think its a relatively straightforward question.

Negative 48 pIm having some issues with line shapes displaying inconsistently in word 2013 while in compatibility mode. I was wondering if there is a way to convert a word document to remove compatibility mode using the Open XML SDK. Basically doing File  Info  Convert, but from code. I found some resources on adding a CompatibilitySetting element to the document but this only makes word think the document is compatible and doesnt change the existing xml structure.p  pI believe converting the document using the UI changes shape elements into graphic elements. I need to be able to run the same conversion from code. This process needs to run on a server so interop is not an option.p  pThanks for reading.p  pKevinp

Negative 48 pIm building a remote control type of app and want to have a remote text field mirroring the behavior of a local text field. Whatever I type or do in a local text field will be repeated in a remote field using web service calls.p  pIm doing this using xdotool, and got typing to work, but I would like to offer the user the ability to edit content as well. Im trying to do this by capturing the position change of the local cursor and sending it over to the remote service. For example, if a user moved 3 spaces to the left, I would send 3 left arrow key strokes instead.p  pstrongIs there a way for me to get notified when the cursor changes position in a text field, as in the image belowstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyPkZS.png altenter image description herep

Negative 48 pIm doing a project and Im not an expert on databases so I run into a few problems. In the architecture Im thinking there are several small databases single workstations that push data into one big centralized Database, which stores those data in tables and only the records are added every time data is pushed.  It would be helpful to analyze those data,but it is necessary for the central database to be OLTP downtime is not viable because its a medical record and must be up at all times so is it possible that the OLAP is another layer above the centralized database and when analyzing doesnt interfere in the exchange of data between these singular workstations and the central database Or does the central database need to be of OLAP architecture itself Also can an OLTP database store for example data like medical history Im asking because that data could be historical data as well, previous diseases etc. so I dont really understand how it would look like in tables.  What would be the requirements for such an architecture lets say for a whole city, data consists of mostly txt and links. thanks for the help in advance guys, hope I was clear enough p  pPs. By the way, this would be a central DB storing electronic health records of patients, which would be pushed by several doctors practices and clinics after a patients visit, or new diagnosis. So the exchange of data would be bidirectional, from the single workstations to the central db and the other way around if doctors needed info from other doctors. Do you know of a better architecture for this If we wanted to analyze those data i think this is the only viable option, but then again, im no expert so cant say much, let me know what you think p

They keep printing the messages which means they still exist, but I have no means to access them or delete them. I also dont see the message printed from the destructor method which means they are not being garbage collected. p  pHow can I delete these anonymous objects that I have created and check that they no longer exist I dont only want the threads to stop, because I could add another method in the myObjects that restarts the thread. I want the myObject instances to be deleted completely. p  pEDIT After 12 minutes of running the objects have finally been garbage collected. Mike was right. p

Negative 48 pIve created a very simple database in Access that tracks timelines for work. Each record in my main table can also be viewed in form view which is more user friendly. My main menu shows the entire table timeline so users can scroll through the timeline chronologically. p  pI want to create a button on the main menu that will take the user to the specific record they are interested in, but in form view. It would be great if there was a button in the table for each record, but that doesnt seem possible.  p  pI was thinking about creating a text box where the user could input the timeline record ID and click a button next to it that would open the form for that specific record.

Negative 48 pI have an application that was written, tested, and debugged for a small linux distribution with a version 2.6.x kernel. I recently attempted to migrate the project to a distribution based on Debian with a 3.2.x kernel and we note huge performance decreases.  Ive done some primitive benchmarking and found differences in usleep timing, differences in function call amp loop timing, etc. p  pIm not sure what the exact 2.6.x kernel configuration is e.g. preemption model, etc and I havent been able to extract kernel build configuration info  we just have this system as an image that weve been using for our embedded applications.  For the 3.2.x kernel I built a configuration with optimizations for our processor, with a preemptable kernel configuration, and removed a bunch of utterly unneeded optional modules stuff like HAM radio device drivers  stuff that stuck out as totally reasonable to remove.p  pOur system is a nearrealtime application that doesnt have hard realtime requirements we just have to keep certain buffers populated with computed data before it gets consumed, which emisem done at a fixed rate, but one controlled by hardware and in practice our CPU load stays around 30 for the most demanding applications ie, we have the performance to keep the buffer populated and do a fair bit of waiting for space.  We use pthreads, pthreadcondwaitbroadcast, etc, to signal buffer states, control thread synchronization, etc. p  pFirst, some preamble about the system. There are many polling threads with the patternp  precodewhile threadRunning     CheckSomeStuff    usleeppollinginterval  codepre  pAnd other threads with patterns likep  precodewhile threadRunning       pthreadcondwaitstuffneededcondition, somemutex  wait on signal     doSomeStuffWhenNeeded  codepre  pThat said, we are noticing subtle timingrelated issues in the ported application, and algorithms are running a lot slower than on the 2.6.x kernel based system. p  pThis simple benchmark is illustrativep  precodestatic volatile long gfoo  static void setfoolong foo      gfoo  foo   static void printElapsedstruct timeval t1, struct timeval t2, const char smsg      double timeelapsed     timeelapsed  t2.tvsec  t1.tvsec1e6  t2.tvusect1.tvusec     printfs elapsed  .8fn, smsg, timeelapsed   static void benchmarkslong sleeptime      long i      double timeelapsed      struct timeval t1, t2       test 1     gettimeofdayampt1, NULL     for i0iltsleeptimei             usleep1          gettimeofdayampt2, NULL     printElapsedt1, t2, Loop usleep1       test 2     gettimeofdayampt1, NULL     usleepsleeptime     gettimeofdayampt2, NULL     printElapsedt1, t2, Single sleep        test 3     gettimeofdayampt1, NULL     usleep1     gettimeofdayampt2, NULL     printElapsedt1, t2, Single 1us sleep       test 4     gettimeofdayampt1, NULL     gettimeofdayampt2, NULL     printElapsedt1, t2, gettimeofday x 2       test 5     gettimeofdayampt1, NULL     for i0iltni              setfooi          gettimeofdayampt2, NULL     printElapsedt1, t2, loop function call  codepre  pHere are the benchmark results yeah, output decimal places is silly I knowp  precodeKernel 2.6.x trial 1 Loop usleep1 elapsed  6063979.00000000 Single sleep elapsed  100071.00000000 Single 1us sleep elapsed  63.00000000 gettimeofday x 2 elapsed  1.00000000 loop function call elapsed  267.00000000  Kernel 2.6.x trial 2 Loop usleep1 elapsed  6059328.00000000 Single sleep elapsed  100070.00000000 Single 1us sleep elapsed  63.00000000 gettimeofday x 2 elapsed  0.00000000 loop function call elapsed  265.00000000  Kernel 2.6.x trial 3 Loop usleep1 elapsed  6063762.00000000 Single sleep elapsed  100064.00000000 Single 1us sleep elapsed  63.00000000 gettimeofday x 2 elapsed  1.00000000 loop function call elapsed  266.00000000   kernel 3.2.65 trial 1 Loop usleep1 elapsed  8944631.00000000 Single sleep elapsed  100106.00000000 Single 1us sleep elapsed  96.00000000 gettimeofday x 2 elapsed  2.00000000 loop function call elapsed  491.00000000  kernel 3.2.65 trial 2 Loop usleep1 elapsed  8891191.00000000 Single sleep elapsed  100102.00000000 Single 1us sleep elapsed  94.00000000 gettimeofday x 2 elapsed  2.00000000 loop function call elapsed  396.00000000  kernel 3.2.65 trial 3 Loop usleep1 elapsed  8962089.00000000 Single sleep elapsed  100171.00000000 Single 1us sleep elapsed  123.00000000 gettimeofday x 2 elapsed  2.00000000 loop function call elapsed  407.00000000 codepre  pThere is a huge difference in walltime between builds on a linux OS using kernel 2.6.x and kernel 3.2.x for 100,000 cycles of a loop that calls usleep1 9 seconds for the 3.2.x vs 6 seconds for the 2.6.x.

Negative 48 pSpring boot is great  we have an app that runs standalone fine, using JAXRS 2, JSF 2.1.6. They versions are irrelevant really, other than they are under our control.p  pOur corporate deployments are on fully blown Java EE app servers though, so we dont have the option of deploying the app to something simple such as Tomcat or even as a jar with embedded Tomcat.p  pTrying to get a Spring boot app to work on these ends up being a world of pain, as the Java EE app server will either stop you completely or partially from using different versions of jars to the ones it ships with.p  pSo my question is, is there a magic bullet that allows Spring boot apps to fully blown app servers like WildFly,Glassfish etc. Or what are the general approaches to getting around this issuep  pThe only one I can think of is to code the application to exactly the same spec as the app server, and then use Maven profiles to ship the jars for the embedded up, but to have them as provided when using them in an app server. Of course this immediately takes away the advantage of Spring not being tied down to a particular version of Java EE.p

It works as intended when I have my multi tenant application and then I set up Native Client Application in Azure AD that I add permissions to mWeb App to. The request going out looks like thisp  precodePOST httpslogin.microsoftonline.commy tenant idoauth2token HTTP1.1 ContentType applicationxwwwformurlencoded returnclientrequestid true xclientSKU .NET xclientVer 2.14.0.0 xclientCPU x64 xclientOS Microsoft Windows NT 6.2.9200.0     xclientlastresponsetime 239 xclientlastendpoint userrealm Host login.microsoftonline.com ContentLength 173 Expect 100continue  resourcemy web app uri idampclientidmy native client app idampgranttypepasswordampusernamemy usernameamppasswordmy passwordampscopeopenid codepre  pWorks great for this prototype. I am trying to see if I could get away without the need for the Native client application to be registered in Azure AD. To do that, if we assume I could securely pass the username and password to my Web application, is there a way to request some resource from my Web application rather than my Native client application that would return response similar to the response from the above request Something likep  precodePOST httpslogin.microsoftonline.commy tenant idoauth2token HTTP1.1 ContentType applicationxwwwformurlencoded returnclientrequestid true xclientSKU .NET xclientVer 2.14.0.0 xclientCPU x64 xclientOS Microsoft Windows NT 6.2.9200.0     xclientlastresponsetime 239 xclientlastendpoint userrealm Host login.microsoftonline.com ContentLength 173 Expect 100continue  resourcesome resource that requires authenticationampclientidmy web app idampgranttypepasswordampusernamemy usernameamppasswordmy passwordampscopeopenid codepre  pAnything that is available in Azure AD I could request Grap API token for example but that requires clientsecret as it accesses the whole directory. I am looking for maybe something profile specific that will will work by passing username and password. Thank you.p

Negative 48 pI am currently a student so please realize my skills are very new only a couple of months literally for all of HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, etc. I am working on a school project for a PHP class and some of what I want to do it outside the scope of what I have learned thus far JSON and AJAX are entirely new to me. This will be my first post on this site although I have used it for reference quite often in the last couple of months.p  pMy goal is to make a website where a drop box selection box it populated with car manufacturers from a MySQLi database table called make. Once you select a car make then the second drop box should become enabled and populate with emonlyem the relevant models for the selected manufacturer. This model information comes from another table on the same database called model.p  pThe make table is structured as suchp  pINSERT INTO codemakecode codeidcode, codecodecode, codetitlecode VALUES 1, ACURA, Acura, 2, ALFA, Alfa Romeo, 3, AMC, AMC, 4, ASTON, Aston Martin, 5, AUDI, Audi, 6, AVANTI, Avanti, 7, BENTL, Bentley, 8, BMW, BMW, 9, BUICK, Buick, 10, CAD, Cadillac, 11, CHEV, Chevrolet, 12, CHRY, Chrysler, 13, DAEW, Daewoo, etcp  pThe model table looks like thisp  pINSERT INTO codemodelcode codeidcode, codemakeidcode, codecodecode, codetitlecode VALUES 1, 1, CLMODELS, CL Models 4, 2, 1, 2.2CL,   2.2CL, 3, 1, 2.3CL,   2.3CL, 4, 1, 3.0CL,   3.0CL, 5, 1, 3.2CL,   3.2CL, 6, 1, ILX, ILX, 7, 1, INTEG, Integra, 8, 1, LEGEND, Legend, 9, 1, MDX, MDX, 10, 1, NSX, NSX, 11, 1, RDX, RDX, 12, 1, RLMODELS, RL Models 2, 13, 1, 3.5RL,   3.5 RL, 14, 1, RL,   RL, 15, 1, RSX, RSX, 16, 1, SLX, SLX, 17, 1, TLMODELS, TL Models 3, etcp  pI have the code populating the first dropbox from the database table make just fine. Once you select a make from the dropbox onchange event it seems to be calling my javascript function ok as I can alert the make and it shows up ok. After that it doesnt work. I am not sure if its calling my php code properly, if the php is working right etc. Please review and let me know what you thinkp  pHere is my HTML amp Javascript function for the two dropboxesp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodeltscriptgt function getModelcarMake    var xmlhttp   var getRequest   alertcarMake This alert is working and shows car make   if window.XMLHttpRequest    code for IE7, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari     xmlhttpnew XMLHttpRequest      else    code for IE6, IE5     xmlhttpnew ActiveXObjectMicrosoft.XMLHTTP         xmlhttp.onreadystatechangefunction        if xmlhttp.readyState4 ampamp xmlhttp.status200        var carModels  JSON.parsexmlhttp.responseText.split    alert carModels.toString   var carModelsHTML     for i0 i lt carModels.length i    carModelsHTML  ltoption value  carModel[i]  gt  carModel[i]  ltoptiongtltbrgt      alertcarModelsHTML   document.getElementByIdvehiclemodel.disabled  false       document.getElementByIdAjaxDiv.innerHTML  carModelsHTML            getRequest  myAjax.phpmakecarMake xmlhttp.openGET,getRequest,true xmlhttp.send  ltscriptgtcodepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeVehicle Make  ltselect namevehiclemake valuelt echo SESSION[vehiclemake]gt required onchangegetModelthis.valuegt lt sql  SELECT  FROM make  Build an MySQLi statement to select the makes of all MFGs result  mysqliquerymysqli, sql  Perform the MySQLi query on the database to get the filename.  whilerow  mysqlifetchassocresult while we havent the end of the list of MFGs  gt       ltoption valuelt echo row[title] gtgtlt echo row[title] gtltoptiongt     lt    gt ltselectgt  ltbrgt  Vehicle Model  ltselect namevehiclemodel valuelt echo SESSION[vehiclemodel]gt required disabledgt ltdiv idajaxDivgt lt Javascript placeholder for getModel function gt ltdivgt ltselectgtcodepre div div p  pHere is my PHP file  I wasnt sure if I needed to include my database connection file again, I assumed not but tried it when the code wasnt working.p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodelt include database.php  value  REQUEST[make]  sql  SELECT  FROM make WHERE title . value  Build an MySQLi statement to select the corresponding make of car result  mysqliquerymysqli, sql  Perform the MySQLi query on the database makeID  mysqlifetchassocresult   sql  SELECT  FROM model WHERE id . makeID[id] Now cross reference the models of car for that manufacturer using the corresponding id from the make table. result  array Reset the result array to be reused. result  mysqliquerymysqli, sql Perform the data collection from the model table of the database  whilerow  mysqlifetchassocresult   models  row[title] .    trimmodels The last entry will have an extra space on the end, in order not to create encoding issues we will trim it off. data  jsonencodearraymodels gt models Encode all the models from the string we created into an object so we can send it back to the javascipt on the client side. echo data By echoing out the object at the end we are passing the encoded data back to the javascript on the other side.  gtcodepre div div p

Negative 48 pI came across a weird scenario, that I just cant figure out on my own.p  pI started a little test scenario, with an almost empty iOS Single View Application and a storyboard. The story boards contains a label and single UIView, 10x10, just for presenting the issue. Of course they have the appropriate IBOutlets assigned and connectedp  precodeproperty nonatomic, weak IBOutlet UILabel label property nonatomic, weak IBOutlet UIView dot codepre  pIn the voidviewDidLoad method I start a timer and add it to the run loop like thatp  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      NSTimer  timer  [NSTimer timerWithTimeInterval0.5 targetself selectorselectordoSomething userInfonil repeatsYES]     [[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] addTimertimer forModeNSRunLoopCommonModes]  codepre  pIn the voiddoSomething method I do the followingp  precodevoiddoSomething       Lets move the dot to the right a bit further     dot.center  CGPointMakedot.center.x1, dot.center.y       About every ten steps, update the label with the current      X position, to better show the problem     CGFloat moduloResult  floatintdot.center.x  int10.0     ifmoduloResult lt 0         label.text  [NSString stringWithFormatf, dot.center.x1]  codepre  pSo basically, I change the center of the little 10x10 dotview every time by  1, and every 10th time I update the label to show the current X position. For that matter it doesnt even matter with what I update the label text, its just important that it changes. And I only change the text every 10 times to better show the problem here.p  pIf I run that code the dot moves just as intended to the right, but then when I update the label text, the dot view gets reset and jumps back to its original position. So updating my label text resets my other views on the Storyboard, which totally confuses me.p  pCan someone reproduce that or even explain it p  pThanks all, in advance p  pAlexp

Negative 48 pI am trying to run a program, specifically CoreTemp 1.0, from a batch file. The user account I am trying to run from is stronga standard userstrong and i need to run it without the UAC prompting, however i would prefer not to turn off UAC. The best solution I can come up with is run CoreTemp using a scheduled task with highest privileges using the command p  precoderunas savecred userltusername with admin accessgt start b schtasks run tn lttask namegt codepre  pWhen I run this command while logged in as the standard user account, it returns error p  blockquote   p2 The system cannot find the file specified.p blockquote  pNote the codestart bcode is only there to keep the command window open and allow me to see the error code. Also note the codeltusername with admin accessgtcode is not the default administrator account. p  pDoes anyone have any idea what could be wrong, or even a better way to run the program from a standard user without the UAC prompt. I thought about enabling the default admin account and point the coderunascode command to it, but i feel like that could lead to a massive security breech. Any way I go, the program needs to start from a batch command. I would also prefer to not need to use some third party program or exe to whitelist CoreTemp, but if that is the only option I am open to suggestions.p  pUPDATE This question has not a duplicate question as the question referenced. I need to launch a program strongWITHOUTstrong the UAC control popping up asking for permission.p

Negative 48 pSo I have a good problem to have, which I and my team have not been able to find the solution to. I developed our current website on the .Net CMS DotNetNuke, using the clients database which has now been updated twice, thus my database is outdated and would cause thousands of new changes to be lost if I were to directly move my website from my localhost to their production server. My question is, is there a way where I can isolate or determine only the changes in the files, and database which have been altered during the development, and only move those particular filestables  The goal is to seamlessly transition my local development into their production, without losing any of their recent database updates. Thanks for reading  Justinp  pP.S.  While I was creating their new website on the frontend, theyve been creating new modules and tools on their live site, hence why the database was updated twice during production.p  pEditp  pMore detailed of the problemp  pSay I designed your website on the frontend. But during production you were making hundreds if not thousands of changes a week on the back end. Thus, during my production of the frontend, my backend the database in this case has become outdated and does not reflect what youre currently running on your production server. So to avoid losing all the thousands of changes you made during the frontend production, how can we marry both the front and backend together WITHOUT losing changes in either. My best guess is to isolate whats the actual changes that were made on the front via files orand DB tables and only upload those, OR is there a uniformed accepted technique for doing such a marriage. p

Negative 48 pI have seen conflicting answers on this, so would love feedback from a seasoned or just moreseasonedthanI iOS developer is there any need to manually scale images from 3x to 2x to 1x, or am I safe just using Prepo or a similar program to take my 3x image and scale it down to 2x and 1x, and then just tell SpriteKit to fit it to screenp  pI have seen many people performing what appears to be a very complicated process of creating images for every possible resolution, but it would make more sense to me to just automate this process. My current process is 1. Create background or image 3x. Background is 1242x2208. 2. Use Prepo to scale to 2x and 1x basically it just multiplies resolutions by 23 and 13, respectively. 3. Tell SpriteKit to fit the image to the screen, since my 2x image is 828x1472, or 2x a 414x736 screen, which doesnt correspond to any Apple device. For example, on a 5S, I would tell SpriteKit to scale the image by a factor of 320414.p  pLet me know if my process above is generally accepted practice, and if not, what the best way would be.p  pThanks.p

Negative 48 pIm planning to create two projects. p  pOne project will be a simple HTMLJavascriptcentric project that uses AJAX to retrieve and poll data from a web service. Lets call it strongProject Astrong.p  pThe other project, strongProject Bstrong, is a RESTFul web service that simply caches data retrieve from external sources.p  pBasically Project B will serve as a web service to more than 1 more project. I will not be exposing Project B to the public. I just used Project A as an example project that will be polling from Project B.p  pIve read about OAuth 2.0 and it seems to be the best and most straightforward way to prevent any other applications to access my web service. But here are some questionsp  ol liSince Project A and Project B will be in two separate domains. Will AJAX work in this scenario Because Ive read that I have to work with JSONP if Im planning to retrieve data from another domain. How secure is JSONPli liAssuming I do implement OAuth, how will I manage my security keys for token encryptiondecryption Initially, what I was thinking was Project A to be a simple Java project which can basically store the secret keys and poll from my web service. That way, problem 1 can be resolved since I can just plainly use a simple AJAX function. But, I feel that its quite unnecessary to make a Java web project just to store the keys and poll the information from the web service. My concern here is that, if I dont make it a Java project, I dont know where to store my keys. Surely, I wont storeexpose it in the JS code.li ol  pWhich leads me to ask, is OAuth 2.0 the right way to go Or are there any other simpler alternatives  p
