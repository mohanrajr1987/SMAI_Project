I have a primary key codeCompanyIDcode defined in the table.p  pThe error I am facing is that the Excel sheet has few duplicate codeCompanyIDcode values. It will also pick up more duplicate values in the future as the Excel file will be updated daily.p  pI want to choose the first record where the codeCompany IDcode field is code1code and the record doesnt have null in the rest of the columns. Also, for a codeCompanyIDcode of code3code there is a null value for one column which is ok since it is a unique record for that codecompanyidcode.p  pHow do I choose a unique row which has maximum no. of column values present ie for eg in the case of codeCompany IDcode of code1code in Talend  p
Positive 12147 pI have an Excel 2010 data file with over 200 variables columns, and over 1,000 records rows, each identified with a unique id number.  However, Im suspicious that some of these records are fabricated, i.e., someone took an existing record, replicated it, and changed only a few numbers to make it a little different.  Therefore, I need to produce a matrix that will show me the numberpercent of same values between each record and all other records e.g., record 1 and record 2 share 75 equal values, record 1 and record 3 share 57 equal values, record 2 and record 3 share 45 equal values, etc..  I have a few workarounds, but they take hours and dont produce a simple matrix.  I dont care about the difference between the values  just whether they are equal or not.  Any ideas will be greatly appreciatedp

Positive 12147 pI have a Pandas DataFrame that contains duplicate entries. Some items are also listed twice or three times. I would like to filter it so that it only shows items that are listed at least n times. In the final table all items should only be shown once. The DataFrame contains 3 columns [colA, colB, colC]. It should only consider colB in determining whether the item is listed multiple times. Note this is not dropduplicates. Its the opposite, I would like to drop items that are in the dataframe less than n times.p

Positive 12147 pWe are using Spring and IBatis and I have discovered something interesting in the way a service method with Transactional handles multiple DAO calls that return the same record.  Here is an example of a method that does not work.p  precodeTransactional public void processIndividualTransIndvTrans trans  Individual individual  individualDAO.selectByPrimaryKeytrans.getPartyId         individual.setFirstNametrans.getFirstName individual.setMiddleNametrans.getMiddleName individual.setLastNametrans.getLastName  Individual oldIndvRecord  individualDAO.selectByPrimaryKeytrans.getPartyId individualHistoryDAO.insertoldIndvRecord  individualDAO.updateByPrimaryKeyindividual  codepre  pThe problem with the above method is that the 2nd execution of the line     individualDAO.selectByPrimaryKeytrans.getPartyId returns the strongemexact objectemstrong returned from the first call.  p  pThis means that oldIndvRecord and individual are the same object, and the line     individualHistoryDAO.insertoldIndvRecord adds a row to the history table that contains the changes which we do not want.p  pIn order for it to work it must look like this.p  precodeTransactional public void processIndividualTransIndvTrans trans  Individual individual  individualDAO.selectByPrimaryKeytrans.getPartyId        individualHistoryDAO.insertindividual  individual.setFirstNametrans.getFirstName individual.setMiddleNametrans.getMiddleName individual.setLastNametrans.getLastName individualDAO.updateByPrimaryKeyindividual  codepre  pWe wanted to write a service called updateIndividual that we could use for all updates of this table that would store a row in the IndividualHistory table before performing the update.p  precodeTransactional public void updateIndividualIndividual individual  Individual oldIndvRecord  individualDAO.selectByPrimaryKeytrans.getPartyId individualHistoryDAO.insertoldIndvRecord individualDAO.updateByPrimaryKeyindividual  codepre  pBut it does not store the row as it was before the object changed. We can even explicitly instantiate different objects before the DAO calls and the second one becomes the same object as the first. p  pI have looked through the Spring documentation and cannot determine why this is happening.  p  pCan anyone explain this  p  pIs there a setting that can allow the 2nd DAO call to return the database contents and not the previously returned objectp

Positive 12147 pI am working on a small expense tracking program. The idea is to have a list that holds Expense objects that can be manipulated and used to perform calculations. p  pI was able to create the List without issue and populate it with several dummy expenses. My expenses are grouped by category, Expense.expenseType, to allow me to do calculations for analysis so I am trying to make another List that will store category names and relevant calculations values. The list of category names is meant to remove duplicates but so far Ive been unsuccessful at populating it. p  pMy approach for creating the List has been to define a Category class that holds only a string parameter for categoryName and a float for categoryTotal although the latter is initialized to 0.00. I then have a For loop that copies the names into the List and a second For loop that removes indexes based on the name once theyve been alphabetized. Ive tried different variations of this but ultimately I get either an index that is out of bounds or a reduced but still duplicates list of categoryName. p  pReally hoping to get some advice so I could move forward with the code. I didnt add the actual code since Im new to CVS and figure I may be approaching the problem all wrong. p

Positive 12147 pContext Im writing something to process log data which involves loading several GB of data into memory and cross checking various things, finding correlations in data and writing the results out to another file.  This is essentially a cookingdenormalization step before loading into a Druid.io cluster.  I want to avoid having to write the information to a database for both performance and code simplicity  it is assumed that in the foreseeable future the volume of data processed at one time can be handled by adding memory to the machine.p  pMy question is if it is a good idea to attempt to explicitly deduplicate strings in my code and if so, what is a good approach.  Many of the values in these log files are the same exact pieces of text probably about 25 of the total text values in the file are unique, rough guess.p  pSince were talking about gigs of data, and while ram is cheap and swap is possible, there is still a limit and if Im careless I will very likely hit it. If I do something like thisp  precodestrstore  makemap[string]string   do some work that involves slicing and dicing some text, resulting in var a  some string that we figured out that has about a 75 chance of being duplicate   note that there are about 10 other such variables that are calculated here, only a shown for simplicity  if , ok  strstore[a] ok      strstore[a]  a  else      a  strstore[a]    now do some more stuff with a and keep it in a struct which is in  some map some place codepre  pIt would seem to me that this would have the effect of reusing existing strings, at the cost of a hash lookup and compare.  Seemingly a good trade off.p  pHowever, this might not be that helpful if the strings that are in fact new cause memory to be fragmented and have various holes that are left unclaimed.p  pI could also try to keep one big byte arrayslice which has the character data and index into that, but it would make the code hard to write esp having to mess around with conversion between []byte and strings, which involves its own allocation and I would probably just be doing a poor job of something that is really the Go runtimes domain anyway.p  pLooking for any advice on approaches to this problem, or if anyones experience with this sort of thing has yielded particularly useful mechanisms to address this.p

That way I can create a constraint on the mobile phone number table to not store duplicates for the ph column.p  pIs this the only possible solution or are there other ways to go about it  I think this would be the preferred solution, correctp  pThanks.p

Negative 12147 pstrongMy questions have to do with this very interesting articlestrong a hrefhttpwww.techcrunch.com20080709otoydevelopingserverside3drenderingtechnologyhttpwww.techcrunch.com20080709otoydevelopingserverside3drenderingtechnologyap  pstrongWhat they saystrong In this article it is claimed that this company can do amazing server sided 3D rendering all the while displaying the output in the browser using Flash, Ajax, Java or Active X. It is also claimed that the fasted method is Ajax running on safari up to 220fps.p  pstrongWhat I have donestrong I have pondered about ideas like this before and I have even fooled around with three methods of rendering to the browser. To be clear I never implemented a 3D render but rather used already available images hosted at google, or randomly generate pixels.p  pMy first two attempts were involved hackishly trying to draw each pixel in the browser using div tags or the canvas tag. I used php to do so making it slow in the first place but looping through tens of thousands...millions of pixels would take years in any other language anyway, it took like 7 seconds in php. the random pixel colors did not significantly increase execution time.p  pMy third attempt involved using multiple images to make the big picture, and I set up a test using a total of ten thumbnails hosted on google where the php script loops through all 10 to randomly display 48 total images on the web page. Every time you press a button the Ajax will call on the php script to rearrange the images. Running this locally with your cache cleared takes about two seconds to display all the images 0.5 seconds after caching.p  pstrongThe WTF how the hell do those lairs do thatstrong Because of my first hand experience and plain conventional logic, what this company claims has to be complete total BS. To do every thing they say and then pass the output over the internet has to take at least 0.5 seconds a frame even with better coding and a faster language. I dont think you could even rewrite a single pixel 220 times over the internet in one second.p  pstrongSo maybe there not lairs, how did they do itstrong I must know before I bust a capillary How did they pass data so fast to the browser using Ajax, not even considering the 3d processing on the server side. Is it just one fast server constantly pushing out an images All I ever wanted was 30 fps and look at thos jerks hogign all the netz.p

Negative 12147 pI am in the process of designing a feature for a system where I strongly feel that there must be a pattern for this out there, that I should know about before diving into the code. p  pThe scenario is thisp  ul liI have a pool of resources of which I have a limited number. li liI have a variable number of consumers that use those resources each consumer needs exactly one resource, and it may not use the same resource as any other consumer at a given time.li liThe consumers are divided into a fixed number of groups, and the system needs to guarantee that there is a minimum of one resource for each group.li liThe number of consumers in each group varies over time they are allocated and deallocated as needed.li ul  pMy current approach is to put the resources into two stacks at startup one emergency stack and one common stack. The emergency stack will contain the same number of resources as there are groups so, one for each group. The rest of the available resources go into the common stack.p  pWhen a new consumer is about to be created, the system will request a resource. If there are resources available in the common stack, one will be popped from it and returned to the caller. If the common stack is empty, a resource may be popped from the emergency stack instead, embut only if there are no consumers within the same group that already has an emergency resourceem.p  pWhenever a consumer within a group can be deallocated, the associated resource will be returned, and pushed onto one of the resource stacks. The code responsible for deallocating consumers will make sure to always return any emergency resources first, so that the emergency stack is filled, before returned resources are being pushed onto the common stack.p  pI feel that this is the sort of problem for which there ought to exist a design pattern that has been tested and proven to work well, so I call out to the community do you know of such a pattern If so, I kindly ask you to enlighten me.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThe solution is now implemented, using bits and pieces from various answers to this question.

Negative 12147 pI am having a problem with the program I am currently working on. It is caused by the increased security in vistaWindows 7, specifically the UIPI which prevents a window with a lower integrity level talking to a higher one.p  pIn my case, i am wanting to tell the window with a high Integrity level to move into our application, It works flawlessly on XP or windows 7 with the security off.p  pI have tried setting the HWND of the higher IL window directly, rather than using the findwindow function, this works fine but the program then fails when trying to move it or generally interact with it. The windowhandle is saved by the app to be embedded and read by the app running at a lower IL.p  pI have also tried setting UIaccess in the manifest to TRUE and digitally signing the program but no luck.p  pAny ideas on how to solve this problem thanks.p

Negative 12147 pWhat bundles do I need to install At least, this would have to be a servlet container  web server such as Jetty, but will the basic codeorg.apache.felix.http.jettycode bundle do, or is there anything else needed to discover the codeweb.xmlcode in other bundlesp  pDo I put the webapp in a standard WAR, add OSGi headers and am done Or are there any webapp specific headers required for the OSGi environmentp  pWhat other configuration has to be donep  pWhat are options to automate these steps using Mavenp  pI have tried deploying the codeorg.apache.felix.http.jettycode bundle, and I get a Jetty answering with 404 on localhost8080. Next, I tried a simple webapp with nothing but a static HTML file configured as a codewelcomefilecode. As far as I can tell, Jetty doesnt even notice the deployment descriptor, at least deploying the test webapp into Felix doesnt change anything at all.p
Negative 12147 pIm getting the joyous type or namespace name Something does not exist in the namespace Something else are you missing an assembly reference error.p  pWhat Ive got is a Website project that contains the website itself along with several other custom projects upon which the website relies.  The issue Im having is with one of the projects on which the website relies, let us call it A.  It relies on a different custom project, called B.p  pSo, B is a part of the solution and I can build B successfully.  A has a reference to B and there doesnt appear to be any errors no little yellow triangleexclamation point.  The website itself also has the dlls for both A and B in its Bin folder.  It also had a dll.refresh file for B which was incorrect wrong path.  However, manually correcting the dll.refresh seems to have no effect.  Removing those files from the websites bin folder has no effect either.p  pIve also tried removing A and B from the solution and then readding them.  Ive also tried removing As reference to B and then adding it again both from the project tab and manually browsing to the .dll itself.p  pIve tagged this Visual Source Safe as well because the project worked until I got the latest version from source control, so this issue is definitely related some change one of my coworkers made conscious or otherwise.  I suspect it was caused by a different file system layout for the project, but Im not sure and if that is the case I dont understand why Ive been unable to fix the problem.p  pThis the result of the Fusion log, I do not fully understand it yet.p  pre      Assembly Binder Log Entry  10202009  14306 PM       The operation failed.

Negative 12147 pstrongGoalstrongp  pPass images generated by one process efficiently and at very high speed to another process. The two processes run on the same machine and on the same desktop. The operating system may be WinXP, Vista and Win7.p  pstrongDetailed descriptionstrongp  pThe first process is solely for controlling the communication with a device which produces the images. These images are about 500x300px in size and may be updated up to several hundred times per second. The second process needs these images to process them. The first process uses a third party API to paint the images from the device to a HDC. This HDC has to be provided by me.p  pNote There is already a connection open between the two processes. They are communicating via anonymous pipes and share memory mapped file views.p  pstrongThoughtsstrongp  pHow would I achieve this goal with as little work as possible And I mean both work for the computer and me of course . I am using Delphi, so maybe there is some component available for doing this I think I could always paint to any image components HDC, save the content to memory stream, copy the contents via the memory mapped file, unpack it on the other side and paint it there to the destination HDC.

Negative 12147 pThe standard MVC example to draw an item with the appropriate View Template isp  pHtml.DisplayForm  m.Datep  pIf the Model object has a property named Date of type DateTime, this returns a string with the HTML from the DisplayDateTime.ascx template.p  pSuppose you wanted to do the same thing, but couldnt use the stronglytyped version  you didnt know the Models type for this View at compile time.

Negative 12147 pI have data from two different sensors loaded into two separate vectors. These sensors measure the same acceleration and hence their pattern is the same. However, because of measurement noise, the values will be slightly different for both. Also, because of the different sampling frequency and delays etc, the length of one vector will be bigger than the length of the other.p  pMy question is, how do I equate these two vectors. That is, I need to find the reading in vectorA that corresponds to a particular reading in vectorB. I tried to compare the extrema using the findpeaks function, but Im not sure how exactly to go about it.p  pThanksp
Negative 12147 h3Goalh3  pMy goal to better understand how concurrency within Java EE environment and how can I better consume it.p  h3General questionsh3  pLets take typical servlet container tomcat as example. For each request it uses 1 thread to process it. Thread pool is configured so, that it can have max 80 threads in pool. Lets also take simple webapp  it makes some processing and DB communication during each request.p  pAt peak time I can see 80 parallel running threads  several other infrastructure threads. Lets also assume I running it in m1.large EC2 instance.p  pI dont think that all these threads can really run in parallel on this hardware. So now scheduler should decide how better to split CPU time between them all. So the questions are  stronghow big is scheduler overhead in this case How can I find right balance between thread amount and processing speedstrongp  h3Actors comparisonh3  pHaving 80 threads on 4 core CPU doesnt sound healthy to me. Especially if most of them are blocked on some kind of IO DB, Filesystem, Socket  they just consume precious resources. What if we will detach request from thread and will have only reasonable amount of threads 8 for instance and will just send processing tasks to them. Of course in this case IO should be also nonblocking, so that I receive events when some data, that I need, is available and I send event, if I have some results.p  pAs far as I understand, Actor model is all about this. Actors are not bound to threads at least in Akka and Scala. So I have reasonable thread pool and bunch of actors with mailboxes that contain processing tasks.p  pNow question is  stronghow actor model compares to traditional threadperrequest model in terms of performance, scheduler overhead and resources RAM, CPU consumptionstrongp  h3Custom threadsh3  pI have some requests only several that take too much time to process. I optimized code and all algorithms, added caches, but it still takes too much time. But I see, that algorithm can be parallelized. It fits naturally in actor model  I just split my big task in several tasks, and then aggregate results somehow if needed. But in threadperrequest model I need spawn my own threads or create my small thread pool. As far as I know, its not recommended practice within Java EE environment. And, from my point of view, it doesnt fits naturally in threadperrequest model. Question arise how big my thread pool size should be Even if I will make it reasonable in terms of hardware I still have this bunch of threads managed by servlet container. Thread management becomes decentralized and goes wild.p  pSo my question  strongwhat is the best way to deal with these situations in threadperrequest modelstrongp

Negative 12147 pPlease see below for my own answer, I figured it out after hours and hours.  Hopefully I save someone some time.p  pI currently have a button on my UI that will modally present an ABPeoplePickerNavigationController, which works perfectly fine.  I want to extend this to implement favorites and recents, so that when the user hits the button I present a UITabBarController that has the ABPeoplePickerNavigationController on one tab, and then two other tabs with the favorites and recents which Im guessing will be UITableViewControllers.  I basically want the tab bar controller to behave like a modal version of the built in phone app for the contacts, favorites and recents tabs but not for just phone numbers.p  pI have searched all over trying to get a solution on how to do this Im new to TabBarControllers, and have thus far tried to do it programmatically with a little bit of success, and in Interface Builder with absolutely no success, all I ever see is a white screen presented.p  pIs there some library that already does something close to this that I just cant seem to find for contacts and favoritesp  pHere is  breakdown on what Ive tried in both methods, and how it workedp  pProgrammatically I basically create the ABPeoplePickerNavigationController like I was going to present it modally alone, but instead add it to a UITabBarController instance using the setViewControllers method.  When I present this, the tab says Groups on it, and I cant figure out how to change the icon to the system icon for contacts, or change the behavior of pressing the tab bar button to not back out into the groups the built in phone app doesnt back up to that level when you press the tab bar button.   Like I mentioned above, I basically want it to behave similarly to the built in phone app for contacts, favorites and recents.p  pIB I tried a ton of things and always only get a white screen when trying to present it modally.p

Negative 12147 pThe other day I asked this questionp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5068984shouldtherepositorylayerreturndatatransferobjectsdtoShould the repository layer return datatransferobjects DTOap  pThe answer well by just one person, but I already had a hunch that it wasnt a good idea was that no, the repository later should not have to deal with the DTO objects their purpose is purely to be sent over the wire and the service layer should deal with that. p  pNow Ive come up with a construction in the meantime that I need your opinion on. The idea is that, when it makes sense to do so, the repository layer can return an interface type Ive defined called codeIProjectablecode. This wraps the query the repository layer does not execute the query yet but does not allow the consumer to change the query its not codeIQueryablecode, just to perform projection operations on it so far for me only codeFirstcode and codeToPagedListcode that would perform the projection and actually execute the query. p  pSo something like this in the repositoryp  precodepublic IProjectableltUsergt GetUserint id    var query  from u in SetltUsergt               where u.UserID  id               select u    return query.AsProjectable  codepre  pAnd in the service layer something like thisp  precodevar dto  repository.GetUser16.Singleu gt new SimpleUserDto    FullName  u.FirstName     u.LastName,   DisplayAddress  u.Address.Street  u.Address.HouseNumber,   OrderCount  u.Orders.Count   return dto codepre  pAm I correct in saying that doing the actual data access here is still the responsibility of the repository layer as it should be and that the projection to a serializable form is the responsibility of the service layer as it should bep  pThe only other way I see to do this emefficientlyem returning a codeUsercode from the repository and doing the codeCountcode on his codeOrderscode in the service layer would result in an extra query to the database is to define a type that has all these properties and return it from the repository layer and just dont call it Dto, which seems silly as it would be identical to the DTO just not named the same for the sake of purity. This way, it seems, I can have my cake and eat it for the most part too. p  pThe downside I see is that you can get a mismatch where the service layer performs projections that cant actually be translated to SQL which it emshouldntem have to worry about, or where it performs such complex projections that makes it questionable what layer is doing the actual data access. p  pIm using Entity Framework 4 by the way, if it matters. p
Negative 12147 pI am trying to modify CodaSlider 2.0 httpwww.ndoherty.biztagcodaslider to use percentagebased widths, instead of hardcoded pixel widths, to allow for fluid resizing. Ive gotten it to work fabulously, except for a small glitch in IE7 Firefox does not exhibit this behavior when I try and move back to panel 1.p  pWhen I run the default index.html that comes with codaslider 2.0, everything works fine in IE7. I then sub in images instead of the default text and that works fine as well. I then changed the CSS and JS to use percentage widths  this works great, except for when I try and return back to the first panel  when I do that, say, from panel 4, instead of smoothly animating back to panel 1 the view jumps instantly to halfway between panel 1 and panel 2, and THEN animates back to panel 1.p  pThis can be seen at a test site I set upp  pa hrefhttpwww.lootcorp.comanimateissue relnofollowhttpwww.lootcorp.comanimateissueap  pThe source of the modified CodaSlider JS file I am using is below. Note I stripped out all nonessential code to simplify debugging.p  pThe problem is tied to the linep  precodeoffset   panelWidthz   codepre  pI thought maybe the animation didnt like getting fed 0 as a value, so I tried feeding it 0 and 0px when panel 1 was selected  same result. The end result is correct  eventually the div is positioned properly at marginleft 0, but I have no idea why it skips to a position halfway between panel 1 and 2 before doing so.

If theyve already granted permission to my app, they get a message saying that the app is already authorized and they have to press Okay to go back to my app. It doesnt look very professional.p  pSo I have two questionsp  ol lipDoes the user always have to reauthorize in order to make Facebook calls I always thought it would save the access token somewhere, maybe in the user defaults, so that you wouldnt need to reauthorize.pli lipIf the user doesnt have to reauthorize every time, is there a way to check if my app already has permission, so the user doesnt have to see that message and press Okaypli ol

Negative 12147 pstrongEdit 2strong What I previously planned was probably a bad idea and I now changed my design My codeUITableViewControllercode has an array with all the values of my codeUITextFieldcodes and I am using delegation to update the values in the array. If a value in one codeUITableViewCellcode changes, I send a message with the new value and the index of the cell.p  hr  pemOriginal Questionemp  pI would like to create a codeUITableViewCellcode subclass. To access my cells, I would like to have an codeNSMutableArraycode in my codeUITableViewControllercode with all the cells. Whenever I create a new cell in code tableViewcellForRowAtIndexPathcode I would add it to the array. The cells should however know about this array. I would declare a property like this for the codeUITableViewCellcodep  precodeproperty nonatomic, assign NSMutableArray cellsArray codepre  pWhenever I create a new cell, I would set its codecellsArraycode to my array. p  pMy probably simple question is Is it correct that codecellsArraycode will hold a pointer to the array in the codeUITableViewControllercode and when I add stuff to the array of the codeUITableViewControllercode, the cells will know this too, i.e. can access itp  pstrongEditstrong The codeUITableViewCellcodes contain codeUITextFieldcodes. I used to rely on the codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode method and the codevisibleCellscode array, however when the cells moved out of view, the content of their codeUITextFieldscode would also be lost. I then decided to store the cells in an array. When the user taps save, I iterate through the array and store the values. Also, I would like to automatically update the codeenabledcode property of the save button, depending on whether all cells contain something  for this I need all cells, too.p  pThe cells should know about the other cells so that they can select the next cell when the returnnext key on the keyboard is pressed.p  pIf there are better approaches to this, I am glad to hear about themp

Negative 12147 pthis is my first time at stack overflow so Im sorry if the format doesnt fit quite right with the site. I just recently started learning programming, almost 2 weeks have passed since.  Im learning python from a hrefhttpopenbookproject.netthinkcspythonenglish3eindex.html relnofollowhttpopenbookproject.netthinkcspythonenglish3eindex.htmla  and everything had been quite nice until now, where I just got stuck for hours. I googled a lot but couldnt find a proper solution to my problem so here I am.p  pIm trying to get the OldMaidGame run without problems as explained on CH17. a hrefhttpopenbookproject.netthinkcspythonenglish3ech17.html relnofollowhttpopenbookproject.netthinkcspythonenglish3ech17.htmla  Most of the code also comes from the previous chapter.p  pWhat Ive found out is I cant get the Deck.remove, Hand.removematches, or any other kind of remove function to work.  After some debugging I found out  that the problem occurs when the program checks if the given card is present in the deckhandetc.  It cant ever make a match.  Then after some looking back on the chapter, in ch16, I found out that if card in deckhandetc removecard etc looks up the .strongcmpstrong of the object to determine if the card actually exists in the deckhandetc.  This is my version of the strongcmpstrong after doing the additions for aces on the given code from the ebook.p  precodedef cmpself, other      Compares cards, returns 1 if greater, 1 if lesser, 0 if equal       check the suits     if self.suit gt other.suit return 1     if self.suit lt other.suit return 1      suits are the same... check ranks      check for aces first.     if self.rank  1 and other.rank  1 return 0     if self.rank  1 and other.rank  1 return 1     if self.rank  1 and other.rank  1 return 1      check for nonaces.     if self.rank gt other.rank return 1     if self.rank lt other.rank return 1      ranks are the same... its a tie     return 0 codepre  pThe strongcmpstrong itself seems fine afaik, ofc I could use some tips on how to make it better like with ace checks.

The test scripts then look at the temp files, not the GUI.  But Id love to extend X11GUITest or make a new CPAN module that can scrape text strings from X11 GUIs.

Negative 12147 pthank you for reading my question.p  pFollowing situation brA sharepoint list, based on a custom content type. The content type is nothing more than a folder with some extra properties like url, targetpage. The folder content types and items represent a menu structure. For examplebrp  pHome  www.home.com  home.aspx br  Subhome  www.subhome.com  subhome.aspx br Impressum  www.impressum.com  impressum.aspx brp  pThis structure has no limits how deep its going to be or how many itemsfolders it can contain. The only restriction is that inside a folder every name must be unique.p  pBecause of the performance I need to fetch all items in the list at once and not for every folder. I managed it this wayp  precode            SPQuery qry  new SPQuery             qry.ViewAttributes  ScopeRecursiveAll codepre  pAfter that I translate the SPListItems into an object called NavigationEntry. This object contains an SiteMapNode and some other properties like the path, itemname and levelcount e.g. HomeSubhome  level2, Impressum  level1.p  pNow I place all this items in a dictionary with the pathitemname as key because its unique and gives me a hint where the item lies. After that I access this dictionary with linq and grab the items level per level until I reach the end no items available on a level. Now comes the tricky part. I have to convert this weird structure into navigation structure for sharpoint. Because im new to sharepoint this is a bit confusing sometimes. p  pAt the moment I go trough the levels and create SiteMapNodes with SiteMapNodeCollections, go to the next level, look if the parentitem is already there, put the child into it and so on. That works, but its very complicated, dirty and fragil.p  pIs there any easy or more structured way to solve this issue Im not looking for an already coded solution but for any hint into the right direction on how to solve this.

Negative 12147 pI am working on a project that I have to Write a simple script that creates two integer variables one called Var1 and one called Var2,places the values 2 and 4 in them respectively, and then outputs the value of the two variables added together. Its kinda confusing for me since I am still learning writing scripts and batches. This is what I have so farp  precode    Declare total Var1 var1 [ 2][, Var2 var2 [ 4]]]  Set total  Var1  Var2 codepre  pTo be honest it kinda looks funny.I am just not understand to do this or if I am doing it right. In a way i dont think i should of even put set in there but wasnt understand how to add the two variables together at the end. I do know that a declare script is you can declare one or more variables at a time.So that is why I did the declare for this one.p
Negative 12147 pI am implementing a search bar that should search for 2 main strings A and B I give priority to the results as follows from most important to leastp  ol lia result combining A and Bli lia result for B onlyli lia result for A onlyli ol  pso for example, if I search for EgyptPyramids i want my first results to be for things like Egyptian Pyramids, followed by those about Pyramids in general or as a geometric shape etc.., then finally results for Egyptp  pI am trying several searching APIs, like Google and Bing, what I currently do is that I search for both first to get result set X, then search for B only to get what i call positive list, then search for A only to get a negative list..

Negative 12147 pIve done some searching and it doesnt seem like there is much in the way of success in establishing a tcpip socket connection successfully via Coldfusion.  Im trying to act as a simple client and send a string over and get a response.  Adobes EventGateway requires serverside setup, which I cant touch, but also appears to be a listener only according to Adobes doc, It can send outgoing messages to existing clients, but cannot establish a link itself..p  pThere is another example on SOcflib.org that is the prevailing post over the web invoking Java objects, but Im not succeeding with it and it seems pretty much everyone else has some degree of trouble with it.  In my attempts, I can get it to initconnect a socket, but nothing else.  If I try to send a string, the CF page loads fine but the server side seemingly never sees anything but will log or note a connectiondisconnection.  If I try to read a response, the page will never load.  If I close the server while its trying, it will show a connection reset while trying readLine.

Negative 12147 pAs far as I understood, ZendTranslate uses strings as keys for translation files. This means that if I change the original string e.g. fix some typo, all translations for this string will be lost.p  pIs there a way to update those translations automatically My idea is to mark those translations as TODO when the original string has changed.p  pTo achieve this, I guess I have to use an ID based translation system instead of a string based translation system. Every string has a unique ID.p  pI know that a string based translation system has the advantage that equal strings do not have to be translated twice. This is a very rare use case in my application, so translation equal strings twice would be absolutely fine.p  pI thought of implementing this myself, but I dont know how to do it with good performance.p  pAny suggestions on this Can ZendTranslate handle changes in the original string Are there other translation systems that can handle this use casep

Negative 12147 pOk here is the problem, I have a winform application that relies heavily on static variables and it being a singleton application only one instance of the process at a time.p  pI now need to create a wrapping application that would create say 6 of those winform applications and switch between their primary windows. The reason for doing it this way, is that these applications have a lot of static references that must be updated depending on what database they are connected to. Our users need to connect to several databases now and reengineering the code to get rid of the static issues is NOT an option.p  pSo my question is this, I know I can create new app domains in one process, but do each of those app domains get a new set of static references Or do I actually have to have separate processes If so, how could I go about building an new application that would create 6 instances of the old application and communicate data to each one of them things like HideShow, load this object, query this database, etc... Looking for something simple as this is going to end up being a throw away project.p  pThanksp

Negative 12147 pIm working on the project. Currently Im facing a problem, I have 3 UITableViews in one ViewController. It looks something like thisbrbr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com65In8.png altenter image description herep  pNow, The first TableViewtop one, has just one row, that has a size of 55 pixels and it dont have to be resizable.

Right now this TableView displaying this rowbrbr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comj9t2U.png altenter image description herep  pThis row must to resize depends on how long the text in it.

Another thing is that it didnt resize the TableView it self, when Im trying to resize it, I get the overlapping of the bottom table by the middle table.p  pstrongCan anyone recommend any solution of this, or maybe another way of implementationstrong p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 12147 pI had to solve a problem concerning the SolidColorStroke of the flex framework. The scenario is simple, we have an visible object and we want a border around it. I built a graphics component that draws a a hrefhttphelp.adobe.comenUSFlashPlatformreferenceactionscript3sparkprimitivesRect.html relnofollowRecta. That Rect was defined as followsp  precodeobject  the object which should get the border, defined somewhere outside,           just fyi   var borderThicknessNumber  10     rect.x  object.x  borderThickness rect.y  object.y  borderThickness rect.width  object.width  borderThickness  2 rect.height  object.height  borderThickness  2 rectStroke.weight  borderThickness  the MXML code ltsRect idrectgt   ltsstrokegt     ltsSolidColorStroke idrectStroke gt   ltsstrokegt ltsRectgt codepre  pI thought it should like this just for illustration, not an exact image of what it should be, the border in this illustration is exactly around the objectp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoLtWT.png altenter image description herep  pBut I was wrong because the border did cover some parts of the objects on the right and on the bottom. My next thought was, that the stroke of the border doesnt grow inside the component, but on each side of the border in equally parts. What I mean by that is that when it grows inside the component and you place it at the location x  0, y  0 the width in my example of the left side of the border would be from 0 to 10. The thicker the border gets, the more it grows to the inside until there is just one big rectangle. p  pWhen I say it grows equally to each part of the border I mean that if you place the rect on x  0, y  0 and your border is 10px thick, the left side of the border goes from 5 to 5. I hope its clear what I mean.p  pSo, as I said before I thought the border grows equally to both parts of the stroke. So I changed the calculations of the width and height top  precoderect.width  object.width  borderThickness rect.height  object.height  borderThickness codepre  pNow the width and height of the object is just increase the borderThickness half of the borderThickness on every side. I thought now the border should fit exactly the object as I expected it with my first version too.... p  pIt look better than the first version but still some parts on the right and the left of the object are covered. p  pAfter a long time of thinking why it doesnt work as I expect I found a solution that worked for me. It seems that the stroke doesnt grow to equal parts on both sides, it seems that it grows by 75 to the inside and 25 to the outside. The following illustration shows what I mean by that. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.combctCm.png altenter image description herep  pThe yellow line inside the border shows the actual border when the stroke would be 1px. You can see that it is now exactly in the middle of the stroke but 75 from the inside and 25 from the outside. p  pMy Question is, does anybody experience a similar behavior Does anyone know why that works the way it does. Am I using it correct Or what am I doing wrongp  pThe documentation of Adobe doesnt really tell you that the SolidColorStroke works this way. If you need more code, please let me know.p  pkind regardsbr  Markusp

Negative 12147 pSome backgroundp  pI wrote a UIScrollView derived class with an outlet named contentView, similar to the followingp  precodeinterface MyScrollView  UIScrollView      IBOutlet UIView  contentView   ...  end codepre  pMy outlet, in this case is an iVar, not a property. I made use of my class in Interface builder and connected a view to the codecontentViewcode outlet. At runtime, however, I discovered that my iVar was still nil and was not set to the desired view object.p  pSome experimentation revealed that if I renamed the outlet or made my outlet a property instead of an iVar, all would work fine. Further research showed that with my outlet as an iVar named codecontentViewcode, loading the nib would actually connect my desired view object to a private iVar in UIScrollView named codecontentViewcode.p  pI know that nib loading uses KVC to set values and that the KVC codesetValueforKeycode method will set a value using any of the followingp  ul licodesetKeycode methodli licodekeycode iVarli licodekeycode iVarli ul  pI suspect, but cannot prove, that an attempt to find the codesetKeycode method occurs first, and if that fails, an enumeration of iVars is undertaken to find the codekeycode or codekeycode iVar next. This enumeration probably occurs in an order that processes iVars from superclasses before subclasses.p  pIs there a documented order in which the above candidates are attempted In what order are members of superclasses attempted in relation to subclassesp

Negative 12147 pI am using the Python C API and trying to create a function that will allocate new instances of PyTypeObjects to use in several C classes. The idea is that each class would have a pointer to a PyTypeObject that would get instantiated with this factory. The pointers must be static.  However, Im having issues with this approach.p  ol liIn the class that contains the pointer to the PyTypeObject, I get the undefined reference linker error when I try to set that static variable equal to the result of the factory function which is in another class but is static. I suppose this makes sense because the function wouldnt happen until runtime but I dont know another way to do this.li liI dont know how to set the PyTypeObject fields dynamically because the first field is always a macro PyObjectVARHEAD. li ol  pHope this makes sense. Basically, Im trying to make it so several classes dont have to redefine PyTypeObject statically, but can instead instantiate their PyTypeObject variables from a factory function.p

Negative 12147 pLets assume that we have a PHP class codePagecode, which generates PHP codePagecode objects in a CMS. Inside the class, we have a function called codeGetPagescode, which returns an array of codePagecode objects for all pages in the system.p  pIf we want to output these in a table, we could do something likep  precodeforeachPageGetPages as page      echo pagegttitle.ltbr gt  codepre  pThis is quite a clean solution, but were essentially performing two loops, when we only need to run it once. I came across this while working on a bespoke CMS that a client has had commissioned, and they now want us to overhaul it simply because of speed.p  pI was thinking that it might be better to remove the codeGetPagescode function from the class, and do something like this on admin interfacep  precodepages  SELECT id FROM igpages result  DatabaseSingletongtQuerypages whilepage  resultgtfetchobject     thispage  new Pagepagegtid    echo thispagegttitle.ltbr gt  codepre  pObviously from an architectural point of view, the function should really be included inside the codePagecode class, but I have some concerns about the loops running twice effectively. Can anyone suggest a better approach for thisp

Negative 12147 pI am creating a simple iCalendar using C and found that the Content Folding per Section 4.1 of RFC 2445 to be quite a headache for me .p  pa hrefhttpwww.apps.ietf.orgrfcrfc2445.htmlsec4.1 relnofollowhttpwww.apps.ietf.orgrfcrfc2445.htmlsec4.1a p  pFor long lines, you are to escape some characters backslash, semicolon, comma and newline, I believe and then fold it so that no line is longer than 75 octets. I found several straight forward way of doing this on the web. The simplest is to replace the characters in question with escaped version and then insert CRLF at every 75th character. Something likep  precode too simple, could break at an escape sequence boundary or multibyte character may overflow 75 octets txt  txt.Replace, .Replace, .Replace,, ,.Replacern, n var regex  new System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex .75 var escapeandfolded  regex.Replace txt, 0rn  codepre  pI see two issues. Its possible that the CRLF is inserted into an escaped sequence. For example, if insertion occurs such that an escaped new line sequence n becomes CRLF then the n will be on the next line. The second issue is when there are multibyte characters. Since calculation is per characters its possible that the line may become longer than 75 octets.p  pA simple solution is to walk the string character by character and escape and fold but this seems rather brute force. Does anybody have a more elegant solution  p

Heres what I came up withp  precodevoid  ShaderReadShaderTypes type, stdstring const amp shader, stdvectorltstdpairltstdstring, stdstringgtgt const amp replace       Perform search and replace on input string.      stdstring newShader  shader      stdforeachreplace.begin, replace.end, [newShader]stdpairltstdstring, stdstringgt const amp pair          boostreplaceallnewShader, pair.first, pair.second               Create and compile shader.      Readtype, newShader  codepre  pNow this wont compile.  I get a slew of errors from boost.  I think its something to do with pair being const, but Im not 100 certain.  When I tried manually creating a stdpair and calling replaceall with it, it worked.  Doesnt like the form it arrives from the lambda though.p  pCan anyone help me pleasep

Negative 12147 pI have an autoloader that is registered using codesplautoloadregistercodep  precodeclass MyAutoLoader    public function construct        splautoloadregisterarraythis, loader         public function loaderclassName        vardumpclassName       al  new MyAutoLoader Register the autoloader codepre  pFrom the codevardumpcode, the autoloader seems to be called on lots of things, things that are data to be inserted into a database, parameterized SQL queries and what notp  precodestring name length4  string a2s5labels4Names8requiredb1 length48  string enUS length5  string object length6  string name   length8 codepre  pThese things will never be classes so should never be loaded using codenewcode or codeclassexistscode, etc. p  pstrongUnder what circumstancesfunction calls are autoloaders calledstrong I would like to put a stop to autoloading classNames that are not classes from being called, because each codeclassNamecode is checked using codefileexistcode, and having these data strings checked is pretty inefficient.p  hr  pstrongProblem resolved.strong I first did a back trace as suggested by Brad and dumped the traces to a file just add a small snippet that opens a file and appends to it.p  pObviously, the trace was very big, but I picked the simplest one I could find. Incidentally, that trace happened to be one that called a database ORM wrapper I have written to wrap around the awesome a hrefhttpwww.redbeanphp.comRedBeana ORM library. The results from me dumping codeclassNamecode also validates that, because those strings are data are going into or coming out of the database.p  pHaving said that, I have a codecallcode that intercepts methods to my database wrapper, does some processing, pass it to RedBean, process the result, and then sends it back to the caller.p  pstrongProblem During the processing, I am making calls to a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenfunction.issubclassof.phpissubclassofa and a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenlanguage.operators.type.phpinstanceofa, which will obviously ask the autoloader to try and load the class since we dont have any class called codename code loaded, nor does it exist.strongp  pThe solution was to actually make sure we have an codeobjectcode before calling codeissubclassofcode and codeinstanceofcode codeifisobjectsomeproperty ampamp issubclassofsomepropertycode.p  pIf codesomepropertycode is not an object, the codeifcode immediately shortcircuits and codeinstanceofcode and codeissubclassofcode is never called, which means the call to the autoloader is never made.p  pAs mentioned by brad, having all sorts of things going to the autoloader to be included using coderequireoncecode can be a huge security risk and at the same time, hitting the file system so many times using codefileexistscode is pretty inefficient too.p  pSo, in conclusion, the autoloader is called every time you use codeinstanceofcode, codeissubclassofcode, other classtype functions, classexist functions and reflection methods, as Charles motioned in his answer. p  pstrongSo, the moral of the story is that if you plan to use a classtype function, or any of the functions mentioned above on a variable of mixed type, check it first before passing it to the classtype function.strongp

Negative 12147 pIve been developing ASP.Net for the past and until recently come across a mobile project. JqueryMobile seems perfect as a framework for this, so I just dived into it.p  pCurrently Im using ASP.Net approach to put server controls on a page, then use jqm to enhance those controls to make them looks mobile. I actually do postback to collect form data and process them in codebehind. To avoid a full page refresh, I had to mix them with updatepanel too. Somehow I got them working but deep down I just feel this isnt the right way or efficient way of doing it.p  pTheres too much complication of mixing things up to get them right, so I think maybe I should just avoid postback and do everythingelse in pure AJAX requestsp  precode.ajax  type POST,   url GetName,   data ,   contentType applicationjson charsetutf8   .successfunction response    alertresponse  codepre  pCodebehindp  precode[WebMethod ]  public String GetName  return Jack  codepre  pQuestionsp  ul lipThis works, but is this the better way to go with jQueryMobile websites, or this is just another bad examplepli lipIs UpdatePanel and postback a bad idea for this scenario I know they workpli lipIf AJAX is preferred, how do I go about populating a dropdownlist on pageload Not server control Sending an AJAX request to populate dropdownlist on document.ready seems stupid to mepli ul  pWhat Im looking for is rules of thumb of developing a mobile site, I dont want to steer too far away from what should be doing right.

Negative 12147 pI have a data set that has approximately 1 billion data points. There are about 46 million unique data points I want to extract from this. p  pI want to use Hadoop to extract the unique values, but keep getting Out of Memory and Java heap size errors on Hadoop  at the same time, I am able to run this fairly easily on a single box using a Python Set hashtable, if you will.p  pI am using a fairly simple algorithm to extract these unique values I am parsing the 1 billion lines in my map and outputting lines that look like thisp  precodeUniqValueCountI    a UniqValueCountI    a UniqValueCountI    b UniqValueCountI    c UniqValueCountI    c UniqValueCountI    d codepre  pand then running the aggregate reducer to get the results, which should look like this for the above data setp  precodeI   4 codepre  pThis works well for a small set of values, but when I run this for the 1 billion data points which have 46 million keys, as I mentioned the job fails.p  pIm running this on Amazons Elastic Map Reduce, and even if I use six m2.4xlarge nodes their maximum memory nodes at 68.4 GB each the job fails with the out of memory errors.p  pBut I am able to extract the unique values using a Python code with a Set data structure hash table on one single m1.large a much smaller box with 8 GB memory.

Negative 12147 pI have a program that I want to display a window above the start screen in Windows 8. The only way to do that that I know of requires I set the flag uiaccesstrue in the manifest. But, in order for that to work, the user of the program needs to be an administrator. So, I tried a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles18367LaunchyourapplicationinVistaunderthelocals relnofollowthis methoda to get a service I install with the program to launch the main program. This way the any user can run the program once installed.p  pThe problem is the uiaccess flag. It seems that in order to launch a program as described in the article, but with uiaccess, the service itself needs to have the uiaccess flag enabled or else CreateProcessAsUser fails. And whenever I try to install the service with the uiaccess flag, I get the error this process requires elevation.p  pSo, the main question is Is there a way to install a service that has this flag enabled I admit that I expect the answer to be no. Since a service running in session 0 would normally have no reason to have this flag, since theres no ui component allowed. But, Im hoping that Im wrong and there is a way.p  pThank you, let me know if I need to clear up anything.p

Negative 12147 pI have a mobile application CE running on a Motorola Symbol 3090 which should allow for scanning  of inventory items and changing their properties on our SQL server The table has existed on the server for years and now they want a way to use mobile devices to update.p  pHere is the problem I am facing which needs addressing.p  ol liOur warehouse is very large and spans over multiple locations so inevitably we have dead zones in the warehouse so having a constant connection is not possible. What I have proposed is a way to go in offline mode and have an up to date copy of our inventory on local device. This would allow all transactions to be found and recorded locally. When the device is returned to cradle or back to wifi it updates the database. With this proposal im not sure if SQL Replication is the best way to handle this type of application. li ol  pWas hoping some more experienced mobile device developers had any input into the design scheme. p  pI have only been developing on these types of systems Motorola symbol 3090 for about 2 months now and have no background knowledge in SQL Replication. I understand the basics of what replication is doing but that is about the extent of my knowledge on the subject.p

Negative 12147 pRecently, I got into a discussion with an Architect who is known to be a seasoned Architect. The discussion was around an ideal Architecture and design for a multitenant Web Based Application that runs in a Web Farm. The applications only job is to allow users to upload n number of Excel files which are being processed by the System to generate very complex reports. Processing of these files takes a long time  an hour for each, lets take it as a constraint. Hence, users after upload wait for the notification from the System to download the generated reports.p  pAt first glance the requirement looks pretty simple, but the expectation is that the application must be 100 scalable. We discussed on various solutions along with the Architectures but we didnt find it satisfactory. I need members from this community to propose solution with design along with Technologies. This is not my professional assignment but its just a survey to find out Architects view on building scalable applications VS just Cloud ready applications where its easy to scale the infrastructure rather than focusing on applications scalability.p

Negative 12147 pI had this idea, and I dont know enough about VBOs and FloatBuffers to know if it is valid. In an attempt to reduce data in my program, I had the idea to hold face data as a single string, and break it up with String.split when rendering. This would remove all redundant vertices from my data, just as a WaveFront .OBJ file does. I figure that it will only slow down the GPU a little each time it draws a face, while greatly reducing my model sizes. However, VBOs and FloatBuffers, both packed and unpacked, take a consistent array of vertex data, represented in a single float[]. It seems that OGLES2.0 wants ALL the data in one buffer, in order. So, my idea doesnt seem to be holding up.p  pexp  pWith redundanciesp  pBuffer   x1, x2, x3... x30,000 p  pDraw all faces in order, all at oncep  pWithoutp  pBuffer   x1, x2, x3... x1,000 p  pfData[x]  xxx xxx xxxp  pDraw each face according to the references in fData[x], one at a timep  pMy questions are as followsp  ol lipIs it ever appropriate to leave out redundant vertices in your buffers and use the .OBJs fData to assemble the faces when rendering Why or why notpli lipIf not, what are my limits I have a model with about 1,000 vertices before redundancies are added. Can a VBO or FloatBuffer handle that many vertices with redundancies in Android Roughly how many of these models could I render at once before I run out of memorypli lipIf so, how do you suggest I let OGLES2.0 know where my data is in the buffer for each face Buffer.setPositionxpli lipWhat are the generally accepted methods of model storage in Android and other flavors of OpenGL How would YOU store each model in order to reduce the amount of data to the smallest size possiblepli ol  pThanks for the help in advance.p  pEdit 5. Would glDrawElements solve my problem Right now Im using glDrawArrays. I just read a post somewhere that led me to believe that glDrawElements is better when redundant vertices exist.

Ive no idea why the JS is not getting executed so hoping someone can spot the problem...p  pWhen I run my app on an iPhone 4S using XCode 4.6.3, everything works up until the StoreKit API asynchronously calls the codeproductsRequestcode success callback in codeInAppPurchase.mcode upon receiving the product data for the InApp Purchase items. I can see the output of the codeNSLogcode statement on line 213 which outputs the codecallbackArgscode in the XCode log window, which contains the correct details of the InApp Purchase items. The line after that should then result in the Javascript success callback being executed, which is defined on line 128 of codeInAppPurchase.jscode and passed in on line 140, but the log output at line 129 never appears in the XCode log window.p  pIf I step through the ObjectiveC using a breakpoint in XCode, I can see that the codecallbackIdcode variable has a sensible value and I can step through codeself.plugin.commandDelegatecode into the Cordova code to where the JS callback is constructed and this all seems fine but the JS never actually runs.p  pI also tried using Phonegap 2.7.0 with the app, but the result was the same.p  pMy XCode project for the app can be downloaded a hrefhttpge.tt1cnJOKov0 relnofollowfrom hereap  pstrongUpdate 19082013strong  The author of a hrefhttpfovea.ccblogindex.php3stepstutorialforphonegapinapppurchaseonios relnofollowa tutorial on how to use this plugina has a hrefhttpfovea.ccblogindex.php3stepstutorialforphonegapinapppurchaseonioscomment81 relnofollowconfirmed this problem with the plugin is reproduciblea but also has yet to find the causesolution.

Negative 12147 pI am writing a web app which will store HTML in a database.  This HTML will have  tags which will point to images.  I am trying to think of a way to abstract the actual location of the images so that I can swap them out without having to update the text in the HTML.  Here is an example of what I meanp  precodeltpgt     asdf asdf ltimg srcimg.png gt asdf asdf     asdf asdf ltimg srcfolderXYZimg.png gt asdf asdf ltpgt codepre  pIdeally, the images here would be relative to some abstract root.  I would like my webapp to populate the SRC value of the images with actual urls at runtime.  E.g. If Im serving form Amazon S3, something like codehttps3.amazonaws.comxxxxxxxxxxfolderXYZimg.pngcode, or if I change it tomorrow, maybe it comes from my local server codehttpexample.comresourcesfolderXYZimg.pngcode.p  pOne thing I have considered is using a regex to pull out he IMG tags and manipulate them.  The other is making up my own syntax maybe something like codeIMAGE folderXYZimg.pngcode.  I dunno how this would be any different functionally, but it seems like maybe a good idea since these images arent necessarily relative to the same server.p  pOne other idea which occurred to me is that I could look up the actual resource in my webapp and stream the resource emfromem that abstract SRC location, making my webapp a sort of proxy for the resources wherever they are stored.  This seems great from a flexibility standpoint the client doesnt have to see different URLs depending on the backend resource location but is partially undesirable because it would put extra load on my server.p  pJust looking for suggestions.

Negative 12147 pI debug django application and want to suspend code execution at the point where exception occurs with cursor pointing to problematic place in code. Pretty HTML display by django would be helpful either but not mandatory. My IDE is PyCharm.p  pIf I set pycharm to suspend on termination of exception, then I never catch it, because django handles the exception with HTML debug info and exceptions never terminate. Setting DEBUGPROPAGATEEXCEPTIONS  True inside settings.py causes HTML debug info to disappear but the execution does not terminate either.p  pIf I set pycharm to suspend on raise of exception, then I have to pass all existing exceptions inside py internals such as copy.py, decimal.py, gettext.py, etc, which is inconvenient there are so many of them that I could never reach exceptions caused by my code. p  pIf I set temporary setup to suspend on raise of exception which occurs after given breakpoint which I place at the last line of settings.py then django server does not start.p  pThanks in advance for your help.p

Negative 12147 pIm just starting out with ColdFusion OOP and I am wanting to make a DIV which shows different links to users depending on what page they are on and what login rights role they have. Basically a context menu.p  pShould I put this toolbarnavigation DIV in a .cfm or .cfc file p  pTo reiterate The cfm or cfc file needs to know what page the user is on and will also check what role they have. Depending on these two pieces of information it will display a set of links to the user. The role information comes from the database and stored in a SESSION variable, and to find out what page they are on I guess it could use codeGetFileFromPathGetBaseTemplatePathcode.p  pMy first thought was to have a normal .cfm file, put all the presentation and logic in that file the HTML and lots of codeltcfifgtcode statements to ensure the correct information is displayed in the DIV, and then use codeltcfincludegtcode to display it on the page. Then I started thinking maybe I should make a Custom Tag and ask the calling page to pass in the users credentials and the codeGetFileFromPathGetBaseTemplatePathcode as arguments and then have that Custom Tag return all the presentational data.p  pFinally I guess a CFC could do the above as well, but Id be breaking the rule of having presentational and logic data in a CFC.p  pAny suggestions on the best practice to achieve what Im trying to do It will eventually serve thousands of customers so I need to make sure my solution is easy to scale.p

If this is the case I am puzzled how it works. p  pI thought the purpose of templates was to replicate the exact same behaviour, but across different classes.

Negative 12147 pIm currently working on a thin API wrapper to ease calling code implementation in order to take advantage of Paypals vault feature, where you can store credit card info, without having to store it locally in our system.

Negative 12147 plets say some blocking IO is done in Java such as a long running db query. Is there in general a way in Java that some Java database driver can tell the JVM scheduler that the call has left the JVM and is now being processed by some external system The JVM could then assign the thread that served the db query for some other operation until the reply from the db has arrived. This way the blocking db query would effectively become nonblocking. p  pJust wonder whether this can be done on the JVM in general. I do Java for many years now, but I admittedly dont know what the Java scheduler is doing in such a situation.p

Negative 12147 pIve used this pattern many times in a variety of places, usually alongside a plugin pattern. p  pSome example ways Ive used it are for messaging systems, such as creating subscribers to various types of unrelated messages. Ive also used it for generic integration workflows that each need a differently shaped context object. p  pBasically the pattern consists of defining a blank marker interface for a message or context. Then defining a high level workflow interface that works with the messagecontext interface. You can then use a factory to get a concrete instance of the workflow, and if needed, the workflow can also be responsible for parsing its message  context from a common data format. p  pNext, you create an abstract generic base workflow whose responsibilty is just to map calls to the interface methods, which pass around the useless marker interface, into calls to abstract methods that take the concrete version of the messagecontext. p  pHopefully that makes sense. Ill provide a code example below. Id love to know if this pattern has a name because Ive noticed that Ive used it about 45 times now. Also, Im just fleshing out how to explain the pattern, so if anything about my explanation doesnt make sense please let me know that as well. p  pThe main point is that you can have multiple classes with different method signatures that can still be called via a common interfacep  pstrongEnd Resultstrongp  precodepublic class ConcreteA  BaseltMessageAgt      public void ProcessMessageA message...     public MessageA ParseIDictionary data...   public class ConcreteB  BaseltMessageBgt      public void ProcessMessageB message...     public MessageB ParseIDictionary data...   And both can by called by... public void Main     var data  GetDataFromIntegrationSourcesomeContext     IWorkflow impl  Factory.GetConcretesomeContext      So in your classes youre able to work with strongly typed parameters,     But in the consuming code you still can use a common interface     Consuming code never even knows what the strong type is.

Negative 12147 pI have in my JSP page code like thisp  precodeltspringurl value varurlgt lta hrefltcurl valuechangelocalelocaleENampcurrenturl gtgtENltagt   codepre  pAnd issue is that parameter url in link is always set to empty String.I would expect that if I type url like localhost8080test the url variable will hold this value and it will be replaced in link so it would look like changelocalelocaleENampcurrenttest. However it is always generated like changelocalelocaleENampcurrent.What I am doing wrong Best regardsp

Negative 12147 pI have a project where we solve the inverse of large over 3000x3000 positive definite dense matrices using a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCholeskydecomposition relnofollowCholesky Decompositiona.  The project is in Java and we use are using the CERN a hrefhttpacs.lbl.govsoftwarecolt relnofollowColt BLAS librarya.  Profiling the code shows that the Cholesky decomposition is the bottleneck.p  pI decided to try and parallelize the Cholesky decomposition using OpenMP and use it as a DLL in Java with JNA.  I started with the Cholesky decomposition code in C from a hrefhttprosettacode.orgwikiCholeskydecompositionC relnofollowRosetta Codea.  p  pWhat I noticed is that the values in a column except for the diagonal element are independent.  So I decided to calculate the diagonal elements in serial and the rest of the values of the column in parallel.  I also swapped the order of the loops so that the inner loop runs over the rows and the outer loop over the columns.  The serial version is slightly slower than the one from RosettaCode strongbut the parallel version is six times faster than the RosettaCode version on my 4 core 8 HT system.strong  Using the DLL in Java speeds up our results by six times as well.

Negative 12147 pI have a large dataset 300,000 observations that represent the distance RMSD between proteins. Im building a regression model Random Forest that is supposed to predict the distance between any two proteins. p  pMy problem is that Im more interested in close matches short distances, however my data distribution is highly biased such that the majority of the distances are large. I dont really care how good the model will be able to predict large distances, so I want to make sure that the model will be able to accurately predict the distance of close models. However, when I train the model on the full data the performance of the model isnt good, so I wonder what is the best sampling way I can do such that I can guarantee that the model will predict the close matches distance as much accurately as possible and at the same time now to stratify the data so much since unfortunately this biased data distribution represent the real world data distribution that Im going to validate and test the model on.p  pThe following is my data distribution where the first column represents the distances and the second column represent the number of observations in this distance rangep  precodeDistance  Observations 0          330 1          1903 2          12210 3          35486 4          54640 5          62193 6          60728 7          47874 8          33666 9          21640 10         12535 11         6592 12         3159 13         1157 14         349 15         86 16         12 codepre

Negative 12147 pIm aware that an NDEF message on an NFC tag is made up of a number of records that each contain a payload which makes up the message stored on the tag.p  pIs it possible to read or write to a specific recordp  pIm asking because I want to know if it would be possible to store, for example, a unique ID in a one record, and have other data stored in the other records. This way, when reading from the tag, I could read only that record to return the unique ID.p  pPossiblep  pThank youp

Negative 12147 h3THE PROBLEMh3  pIm looking for a way to decrease the 4050 second wait every time our SASS needs to compile into main.css. Ive already gotten it down from over a minute by switching from using Compass for compiling to using gruntcontribsass. I need to get it down to 510 seconds, or as close to that as possible.p  h3CANT USE LIBSASSh3  pIm a little bit stuck using SASS 3.3 and Compass unless we absolutely have to switch for the performance. We do use bootstrapsass so it would be hard to get rid of Compass entirely. This means we cant easily switch to libsass. But any code in Compass can also be copied from their repository directly into our mixins partial so anything is possible with enough effort.p  h3USER THEMESh3  pThe worst thing for our speed by far is that we have different usergroups, each with their own set of variables used to compile the SASS with a custom theme. So our SASS needs to compile once for the main theme, main.css, and then once more for each usergroup in the system to make their theme.css. As we add users the compile time that results when any of our main partials are changed increases linearly. Any suggestions to speed this up are also welcome.p  h3REPLACE IMPORT WITH REQUIREh3  pI read on the TreeHouse blog that import slows things down a lot when using the stock Ruby SASS compiler. We do have a lot of partials, and the user themes as well, and we have bootstrapsass rigged to compile using our variables instead of bootstraps default ones. So there are a lot of import statements. TreeHouse used Sprockets in their Rails project, replacing import with require, to speed up their 1min SASS compilation to something like 3 seconds. Django has a port of Sprockets called djangogears, could implementing that have the same effect on our SASS Can we use djangogears together with grunt There doesnt seem to be much mention of using the technologies together in the Googlesphere. edit found the article I was talking about, updated this section. a hrefhttpblog.teamtreehouse.comtalefrontendsanitybewaresassimport relnofollowhttpblog.teamtreehouse.comtalefrontendsanitybewaresassimportap  pEdit 2 No, Grunt and djangogears dont really work together. I dont think we need to use Gears to achieve this effect though. Im going to  try using some sort of Grunt file concatenation plugin to replace the Sass import statements, Ill report back here about what it does to our compilation time.p  h3CONCLUSIONh3  pAnyway, thats all the research Ive done so far, pretty much. We could rewrite our SASS to work with libsass, which would be tough and take a decent amount of time. We can implement djangogears to possiblymaybe speed things up using require. Or, not mentioned yet, we can replace Grunt with Gulp. Gulp seems to have a slightly faster version of gruntcontribsass but might cause trouble if we need a plugin later down the line that doesnt exist for Gulp since Gulp is smallernot as wellsupported as Grunt.p  pIs there anything that Ive missed so far in my research Any further suggestions Im not terribly experienced so any sage advice Stackoverflow has to offer would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 12147 pWPF and WinRT C  XAML both support UI virtualization using panels that support it such as codeVirtualizingStackPanelcode and others. When using MVVM Its done using an codeItemsControlcode of some sort codeListBoxcode, codeGridViewcode, etc... that is bound to an enumerable property on the view model usually ObservableCollection. The items control creates the UI only for items that become visible. Its called UI virtualization because only the UI is virtualized. Only the view of items that are not presented is not created, and is deferred to the moment in time that the user actually scrolls to the item. The view models objects in the list are all created in advance. So if I have a list of 100,000 people to present, the codeObservableCollectioncode will have to include 100,000 view models that are made regardless of when the user scrolls them into view.p  pIn our application, we would like to implement it so that the view model layer is a part of this virtualization. We want the items control to present a scroll bar that fits the total number of items that can potentially be loaded so the observable collection should make the items control think that it already contains 100,000 items, so that the scroll bar view port is in the right size, but we want the observable collection to be notified any time a new item is about to come into view so it can load the actual object from the server. We want to be able to show some sort of progress indicator inside loaded items and then replace it with the actual data template for the item as soon as it is loaded into the observable collection.p  pAs much as possible, we would like to maintain the MVVM guidelines, but performance and responsiveness are a priority. We also prefer a reusable solution if at all possible.p  pWhat would be the best way to tackle thisp

Negative 12147 pFirstly, Im a big fan of the site and have used it countless time to help me when stuck on a problem, but this is the first time I have come across something that has required me to write a question because I simply cannot find a situation like this.p  pI have a Json file which I am loading a bunch of data from that I then run through with my code to put the right data in the right places so it can be rendered by ThreeJS quick side note, big thanks to mrdoob, westLangley and the rest of the ThreeJS team for what theyve done and their continued engagement with helping people here.p  pSo at that point the mesh is able to be rendered and have orbit controls and so on. Then I made just a simple exporter in a similar style to that of ThreeJS.orgeditor. The big difference being that I simple use JSON.stringify on a number of objects the one I will focus on here is called geo and write their data to a new Json json2. The goal being that now I can simply load json2 into the new program which will populate geo with the data of the json2s geo thus circumventing all of the processing that goes into putting the data in the right places.p  pNow here is the issue. All the data seems to be the same between the two geos, but when going to color a face in the code by usingp  precodefor  var i  0 i lt sD.geo.faces.length i                var face  sD.geo.faces[ i ]             face.color.setStyle0066FF          codepre  pthe error that face.color does not have a function called setStyle rough quote from memory appears. And again, this works perfectly fine in the first program.p  pSo I looked into it further and it seems that when digging into the face variable in the code above via firebug, it doesnt have a constructor or prototype in its drop down menu, as it does have the first program. Ill upload screenshots of the two dropdowns to show more visually in a little while. strongUpdatestrong Nevermind, I dont have enough rep to post them. Forgot about that hahap  pSo the data I have doesnt have the constructormethods, so could it be that the data Im setting the sD.geo equal to even did it so that it just sets the vertices from the json2 to the sD.geo.vertices so as to avoid that but didnt work, obviously. Any other ideas as to what my issue could be Should I add the methods to the json2 and how because I looked into that a lot and couldnt find any good examples on it.p  pI apologize if I jumped all over the place throughout this, I tried to keep it as linear as possible as to cause as little confusion as possible. p  pAny and all help is appreciated, and I am more than willing to answer any questions anyone has that I am able to.p  pThanks  p

Negative 12147 pI have been trying to figure out what I am doing wrong. I have two radio buttons one for a new user a the other for an existing user.

I have written code for the radio buttons but they are not working properly.

Negative 12147 pI am having real difficult time using auto layout as when I sometimes change the views, it becomes a real mess with the already assigned constraints.

Android has sysconf method and that is returning 256 for max open file descriptors limit. The strange thing is that Android allows a process to open 1024 files.

Negative 12147 pI have a WPFMVVM application. When a item is selected in my listview I have a section of the datatemplate I want to be visible, then when a different item is selected it will be collapsed, and the new item will be visible. I will mock up some code below to help show what I am trying to do. p  pMy question is how to do this for just the selected item staying in the bounds of mvvm. I know I can bind to a property in my viewmodel, but if every item has the same binding they all open, I need it to be for just the selected item and Im not sure the best way to deal with this in MVVM, looking for suggestions.

Negative 12147 pI am responsible for a site that needs to work in IE 9 as well as current browsers. The site is a hrefhttpwww.wtc.army.mil relnofollowhttpwww.wtc.army.mila  I have made some changes to the current live site and need to push them live, however when I render inside DW in IE 9, a few minor elements on the page will not render properly even though I havent changed these sections of the code these elements being social media icons at top right of page will not display, the glyphicons i think thats what theyre called next to some of links at the bottom wont display, and one other image next to a paragraph on the right side of the page. p  pI have compared the new code to the current live site and there are no differences within the code besides the minor changes that should not affect the failed elements I mentioned. The changes I have made should in no way affect these elements that are not displaying properly. Could DW be rendering the page differently then how it will show when I push it live, and these elements that arent rendering correctly in DW actually be fine when I push them live Another thing to note is that the new code works perfect in other browsers. its IE that is causing the issue. So my main question is Is it possible for DW to render the code in IE differently then how it appears when it is pushed livep

Based on my understanding, we should pass a codeDcode pointer as codethiscode to Df2 function.p  pupdatep  pIf passing a codeB2code pointer as codethiscode to Df2, What if we want to access the members of codeB1code class in Df2 I believe the codeB2code pointer this is shown like this p  precode          d D dgt      0 pointer to virtual method table of D for B1              4 value of intinb1 B2 b2gt    8 pointer to virtual method table of D for B2              12 value of intinb2              16 value of intind codepre  pIt already has a certain offset of the beginning address of this contiguous memory layout. For example, we want to access codeb1code inside Df2, I guess in runtime, it will do something like codethis4code codethiscode points to the same address as b2 which would points codeb2code in codeBcode p

Negative 12147 pI am trying to understand the benefit which HibernateDAOSupport provides over HibernateTemplate. HibernateTemplate pretty much does everything.

Negative 12147 pSo basically, I am tasked with recreating a 3D Earth, comprised of very small tiles made of NASA Landsat 8 images png. Each point on Earth is imaged once every 16 days or so, and the API Im using serves the latest images ie they cant be compiled offline and used statically .p  pThese tiles are 150kb each, and have a width and height of 0.025 latlong. This means that Ill probably have to use a static mesh for low zoom levels, and as a user zooms in, Landsat tiles will be dynamically generated based on their viewport.p  pHave any of you built a 3D Earth with custom tiling before I was looking at the a hrefhttpwww.webglearth.org relnofollowWebGL Earth APIa, but its very limited. Ive also taken a look at a hrefhttpcesiumjs.orgfeatures.html relnofollowCesiuma, but Im not sure if its capable of what I want to do.p  pBasically, Im looking for a 3D model of Earth or even just a sphere that will allow me to stick images to specific latlon points. Otherwise, I suppose Ill just have to make a sphere in ThreeJs and do the calculations myself, but Im afraid that without using a preexisting map system like a hrefhttpleafletjs.com relnofollowLeafleta, the whole thing will come out totally inaccurate. p

Negative 12147 pI would like to say upfront that Im only starting to learn about and use the Go language and also that this isnt a syntax question but more of a language design question.p  pIn Go, assuming that you have a channel codeccode of codeintcode, you can send on the channel usingp  precodec lt 1 codepre  pAnd receive from the channel into a variable codevcode withp  precodev  lt c codepre  pIve read that a simple way to remember the syntax is that the arrow points in the direction in which information is flowing, which I think is poetic, especially being quite the Python fan. My question is why is this not taken all the way so you have the symmetric syntaxp  precodev lt c codepre  pin order to receive from a channel Why have the equals sign therep  pI suppose the interpreter would end up with adjacent syntax tokens likep  precode[variable][value] codepre  pwhich could conceivably come from a statement likep  precodev 1  codepre  pSo that the equals sign there allows you to reuse the usual variable assignment machinery by making that channel receipt evaluate to a value. Would it be that difficult to make the interpreter accept the version without the equals sign though It would basically just have to treat it as a binary operator for that case.p  pIt also seems to lead to other cases where if there are two channels codec1code and codec2code you have the syntaxp  precodec2 lt lt c1 codepre  pIn order to read from one and transmit it into the other. p  hr  pId like to also say that Im not trying to elicit opinions on style but rather trying to understand the decisions drove Go to be the way it is.p
Negative 12147 pHi I am having some trouble understanding how the data access tier and the logic tier interact within the architecture. For the record the application will be an Android exclusive social networkp  ol liThe presentation tier is an Android deviceli liThe logic tier will be a RESTful API being consumed by the Mobile Device. this tier will use JavaEE JAXRSJerseyTomcat located on server Ali liThe data tier is a MySQL DB using JavaEE JPAHibernate located on server Bli ol  pFrom my understanding the Data tier delivers JSON containing the data back to the business tier which then parsesperforms whatever computations on the JSONp  pWhat confuses me is, what is the deliverable from the logic tier What should the logic tier actually send to the data tier, I mean ultimately all the logic tier should need to do request from the data tier is I need this data right But what form should this request takep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions312187whatisntierarchitectureWhat is NTier architecturea seems to indicate JSON or some kind of encrypted data containing an SQL query I cannotshould not execute the query from the logic tier as it is on a seperate machine to the DB. But is it ok to send a DB request over the web from the business logic tier to the data tierp  pI have also looked at DTODAOs which sound like they may be the solution I am searching for, but I am unsure.p  pThanks for any help you can offerp

Negative 12147 pI was initially using codeRediscode in cluster mode at production. But later I realised that if I use codeRedis independent serverscode using codeShardedJedis java APIcode, I can use codeShardedJedisPipelinecode which has better performance due to obvious reasons.  But while using codeRedis Servercode to maintain automatic fail over and high availability, I must use codeRedis Sentinelcode. So, I started looking into codeSentinelcode. But while doing the initial codePOCcode, I got to know that I can not use codeShardedJediscode and codeSentinelcode at the same time.p  pNow it seems that all my paths are closed asp  ol licodeRedis Clustercode does not support Pipelineli liI can not achieve high availability and automatic fail over without codeSentinelcodeli liI can not use codeSentinelcode with codeShardedJediscode.li ol  pPlease correct me if I am wrong anywhere and please suggest me the best strategy to achieve performance as well as high availability and automatic fail over.p

Negative 12147 pI have a Spring MVC application which presents a view which shows all of the fields from a codeCustomercode entity such as name, address, phone number etc. The application has various roles such as codeROLEUSERcode and codeROLEADMINcode. Users with codeROLEUSERcode are only able to see the customer name where as users with codeROLEADMINcode can see all of the customer fields.p  pAt the moment the way I have implemented this is with a a hrefhttpwww.thymeleaf.org relnofollowThymeleafa view which makes use of the a hrefhttpsgithub.comthymeleafthymeleafextrasspringsecurity relnofollowSpringSecurityDialecta to restrict access to certain fields based on the users rolep  precodeltthblock secauthorizehasRoleROLEADMINgt   ltdiv thtextcustomer.phoneNumber gt ltthblockgt codepre  pWhilst this works absolutely fine it doesnt feel right and its difficult to test. I would like to write tests against the controller which call the controller method with a principal that has different roles such as codetestViewCustomerAsRoleAdmincode and codetestViewCustomerAsRoleUsercode. This isnt possible to verify as the controller returns a codeCustomercode to the view which is fully populated and has every field accessible via the getters.p  pWhat Im after is some sort of field level security at the entity level where I can make use of the Spring Security annotationsp  precodePreAuthorizehasRoleROLEADMIN public String getPhoneNumber    return phoneNumber  codepre  pIt would be ideal if this could then raise an codeAccessDeniedExceptioncode when trying to access the field if the principal is not authorized.p  pThe Jersey project seems to have this sort of concept which is mentioned a hrefhttpblog.dejavu.sk20140204filteringjaxrsentitieswithstandardsecurityannotations relnofollowherea, a hrefhttpsjersey.java.netdocumentationlatestentityfiltering.htmlef.security.annotations relnofollowherea and an example a hrefhttpsgithub.comjerseyjerseyblobmasterexamplesentityfilteringsecuritysrcmainjavaorgglassfishjerseyexamplesentityfilteringsecuritydomainRestrictedSubEntity.java relnofollowherea. It does however seem to be limited to role based security rather than the full SpEL support offered with codePreAuthorizecodep  pIs there any way or implementing this sort of thing with Spring Security, I know the security context or SpEL evaluation context is not available in entities as they are not Spring managed. If not, is there any other approach which might allow me to achieve the same thingp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI dont know the Spring Security framework inside out but it seems like something that might be able to be done using Spring AOP in ApectJ mode to instrument methods of domain entity classes. It would then be a case of getting hold of the codeAccessDecisionManagercode and passing along the authentication presumably obtained from the codeSecurityContextHoldercode along with the contents of the annotation on the domain class methods if present.

Is there a list of properties to use on this socket object. right now Im thinking that codesocketcode is an object and that we can add a new property with the dot methodoperator, in this case the made up property is username and the object is socket . and we get the username from codesocket.emitadd user, usernameInput.val.trimcode  from the client script.p  precodesocket.onadd user, function username   we store the username in the socket session for this client socket.username  username  add the clients username to the global list usernames[username]  username codepre  pSince Im not sure how to use this socket object Im not sure if  I need to use it for this small game Im trying to make. basically theres a canvas on the client and its split up into 4 quadrants and if player1 clicks on the top right, the top right quadrant on the clientplayer1 and players 2 canvas is filled. and the player go back and forth clicking quadrant filling up the canvas  I get the quadrant info by doing something likep  precode        function checkCoordleft,top, right, bottom             x and y are retreived on mousemove             ifx lt right ampamp y lt bottom                 return topLeft                           if x gt left ampamp y ltbottom                  return top right                        codepre  pDo I need to do something like codesocket.playercode in the index.js file if so how would i do itp  pwould this keep track of which player clicks on the quadrant p  pAfter writing the above I looked over the code again I seep  pcodeio.onconnection, function socket codep  pdoes this mean that when the socke.io code from the servermodule hears  a codeconnetioncode event we do some callback that has a socket object and now we could do something with the socket objectp  psorry this is so long. just want to learn how to use this socket stuff.p

Negative 12147 pI have some trouble understanding how privileges and memory protection are implemented using segmentationpaging.p  ol lipWhen segmentation is used, additional bitsfor privileges and the segment length are stored in the segment table.

Negative 12147 pFrom this developer guide on Loaders, p  blockquote   pThey automatically reconnect to the strongemlast loaders cursorstrong when being   recreated after a configuration changeem. Thus, they dont need to   requery their data.p blockquote  pI assume that by last loader, they mean that the loader which was destroyed when the Activity was destroyed during the configuration change. Then by saying last loaders cursor, they mean the cursor which was associated with the last loader. This tells us that strongwhen an Activity is destroyed because of a configuration change, its loaders are also destroyed, but the cursors or any other form of data that the loader has loaded is not destroyed.  Is that correctstrongp  pActually it is a little difficult to internalize this. My intuition says that when the loader is destroyed, everything associated with it, including the cursor associated with it should also be destroyed.p
