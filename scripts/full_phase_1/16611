Positive 16611 pIm getting unwanted results in Adobe Reader DC when generating or regenerating a multiselection list box with iTextSharp in an Acroform PDF document.p  pProblem The PDF form is missing deselected display items at the beginning of the list box when viewing the modified PDF in Adobe Reader DC. For example One,Two,Three,Four,Five are list items and Two and Four are selected then the previous items such as One are missing the top of the list box. And the first item displayed in the list box starts with the first selection, in this case Two. See Adobe Reader DC Screenshotp  pFYI Using Adobe Reader DC, when I select different field selections in the list box, and then click outside the list box, the list box field reverts back to normal appearance with all the items shown. I cant reproduce this behavior when opening the modified PDF in Adobe Acrobat Professional 8 and all the field items are visible and correctly selected. This missing list items behavior can also be reproduced in GhostScript when converting PDF to BMP or PNG.p  pPlease answer my question Can you please provide me with a resolution to this issue if this is an iTextSharp problem or if my syntax is incorrect. Would you also please let me know if this behavior can reproduced using your Adobe Reader DCp  pThank you for your supportp  pModified Acroform PDF Document with issue a hrefhttpwww.nkinc.comlistboxerror.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.nkinc.comlistboxerror.pdfap  pAdobe Reader DC Screenshot a hrefhttpwww.nkinc.comlistboxerrorreader.gif relnofollowhttpwww.nkinc.comlistboxerrorreader.gifap  precodeADDITIONAL INFORMATION iTextSharp.dll Version 5.5.6.0 Adobe Reader DC Version 2015.008.20082 Adobe Acrobat Pro Version 8.x Form Type Acroform PDF codepre  pVB.NET CODE v3.5  Windows Applicationp  precodeImports iTextSharp.text.pdf Imports iTextSharp.text Imports System.IO Public Class listboxTest     Private Sub RunTest         Dim cList As New listboxTest         Dim fn As String  Application.StartupPath.ToString.TrimEnd amp listboxerror.pdf         Dim b As Byte  cList.addListBoxSystem.IO.File.ReadAllBytesfn, New iTextSharp.text.Rectangle231.67, 108.0, 395.67, 197.0, ListBox1, ListBox1, 1         File.WriteAllBytesfn, b         Process.Startfn     End Sub     Public Function addListBoxByVal pdfBytes As Byte, ByVal newRect As Rectangle, ByVal newFldName As String, ByVal oldfldname As String, ByVal pg As Integer As Byte         Dim pdfReaderDoc As New PdfReaderpdfBytes         Dim m As New System.IO.MemoryStream         Dim b As Byte  Nothing         Try             With New PdfStamperpdfReaderDoc, m                 Dim txtField As iTextSharp.text.pdf.TextField                 txtField  New iTextSharp.text.pdf.TextField.Writer, newRect, newFldName                 txtField.TextColor  BaseColor.BLACK                 txtField.BackgroundColor  BaseColor.WHITE                 txtField.BorderColor  BaseColor.BLACK                 txtField.FieldName  newFldName ListBox1                 txtField.Alignment  0 LEFT                 txtField.BorderStyle  0 SOLID                 txtField.BorderWidth  1.0F THIN                 txtField.Visibility  TextField.VISIBLE                 txtField.Rotation  0 None                 txtField.Box  newRect 231.67, 108.0, 395.67, 197.0                 Dim opt As New PdfArray                 Dim ListBoxItemDisplay As New ListOf String                 ListBoxItemDisplay.AddOne                 ListBoxItemDisplay.AddTwo                 ListBoxItemDisplay.AddThree                 ListBoxItemDisplay.AddFour                 ListBoxItemDisplay.AddFive                 Dim ListBoxItemValue As New ListOf String                 ListBoxItemValue.Add1X                 ListBoxItemValue.Add2X                 ListBoxItemValue.Add3X                 ListBoxItemValue.Add4X                 ListBoxItemValue.Add5X                 txtField.Options  iTextSharp.text.pdf.TextField.MULTISELECT                 Dim selIndex As New ListOf Integer                 Dim selValues As New ListOf String                 selIndex.AddCInt1  SELECT 1 index                 selIndex.AddCInt3  SELECT 3 index                 txtField.Choices  ListBoxItemDisplay.ToArray                 txtField.ChoiceExports  ListBoxItemValue.ToArray                 txtField.ChoiceSelections  selIndex                 Dim listField As PdfFormField  txtField.GetListField                 If Not String.IsNullOrEmptyoldfldname amp  Then                     .AcroFields.RemoveFieldoldfldname, pg                 End If                 .AddAnnotationlistField, pg                 .Writer.CloseStream  False                 .Close                 If m.CanSeek Then                     m.Position  0                 End If                 b  m.ToArray                 m.Close                 m.Dispose                 pdfReaderDoc.Close             End With             Return b.ToArray         Catch ex As Exception             Err.Clear         Finally             b  Nothing         End Try         Return Nothing     End Function End Class codepre

Positive 16611 pI am using iTextSharp in asp.net C in order to merge more than one PDf template. There is a functionality of print which prints only data of the template.

Positive 16611 pEDIT Link to test files below.p  pAs part of a project, I have created dynamic PDF forms in LiveCycle Designer 11.0. These forms are set to be reader enabled in Acrobat before being forwarded to the developer.

Positive 16611 pIve recently used iTextSharp to create a PDF by importing the 20 pages from an existing PDF and then adding a dynamically generated link to the bottom of the last page.  It works fine... kind of.  Viewing the generated PDF in Acrobat Reader on a windows PC displays everything as expected although when closing the document it always asks Do you want to save changes.  Viewing the generated PDF on a Surface Pro with PDF Reader displays the document without the first and last pages.  Apparently on a mobile device using Polaris Office the first and last pages are also missing.p  pIm wondering if when the new PDF is generated its not getting closed off quite properly and thats why it asks Do you want to save changes when closing it.

Negative 16611 pIm looking for ideas for a heapmanager to handle a very specific situation Lots and lots of very small allocations, ranging from 12 to 64 bytes each. Anything bigger, I will pass on to the regular heapmanager, so only tiny blocks need be catered for. Only 4byte alignment is needed.p  pMy main concerns arep  ol liOverhead. The regular libc heap will typically round up an allocation to a multiple of 16 bytes, then add another 16 byte header  this means over 50 overhead on a 20byte allocation, which sucks.li liPerformanceli ol  pOne helpful aspect is that Lua which is the user of this heap will tell you the size of the block its freeing when it calls free  this may enable certain optimisations.p  pIll post my current approach, which works ok, but Id like to improve on it if at all possible.

Negative 16611 pC provides a syntax for checked exceptions, for examplep  precodevoid G throwException void f throw codepre  pHowever, the Visual C compiler doesnt check them the throw flag is simply ignored. In my opinion, this renders the exception feature unusable. So my question is bemis there a way to make the compiler check whether exceptions are correctly caughtrethrownemb For example a Visual C plugin or a different C compiler.   p  pPS. I want the compiler to check whether exceptions are correctly caught, otherwise you end up in a situation where you have to put a catch around every single function call you make, emeven if they explicitly state they wont throw anythingem.p  pbUpdateb the Visual C compiler does show a warning when throwing in a function marked with throw.

Negative 16611 pI was recently asked to assist another team in building an ASP .NET website. They already have a significant amount of code written  I was specifically asked build a few individual pages for the site.p  pWhile exploring the code for the rest of the site, the amount of DataTables being constructed jumped out at me. Being a relatively new in the field, Ive never worked on an application that utilizes a database as much as this site does, so Im not sure how common this is. It seems that whenever data is queried from our database, the results are stored in a DataTable. This DataTable is then usually passed around by itself, or its passed to a constructor. Classes that are initialized with a DataTable emalwaysem assign the DataTable to a privateprotected field, however only a few of these classes implement IDisposable. In fact, in the thousands of lines of code that Ive browsed so far, I have yet to see the Dispose method called on a DataTable.p  pIf anything, this doesnt seem to be good OOP. Is this something that I should worry about Or am I just paying more attention to detail than I should Assuming youre most experienced developers than I am, how would you feel or react if someone who was just assigned to help you with your site approached you about this problemp

Negative 16611 pI am looking for a special template class, hopefully either a QT template or a selfcontained open source library. This template class is intended to act as a container for a set of objects. Each object in the set has an integervalued weight function but the weight function itself is arbitrary. It could range uniformly from 10 to 100 or vary nonuniformly from 1000 to 10000 or be a constant value. p  pThe template would keep a list of objects sorted by this weight resolving ties arbitrarily. It would allow me to quickly retrieve the object having emnth highest weightem from the list, emby order, not valueem random access using an integer, like QList. The template also allow me to quickly add and remove arbitrary elements while keeping the list ordered by weight like a QMap. p  pJust quickly finding objects within an order of magnitude would be enough for my purposes  IE, finding the 1st, the 10th, the 100th, the 1000th and soforth elements in my ordered list would suffice.p  pI could implement a data structure like this myself as an array of lists of increasing size or as a modified a binary tree having a count of n elements below each node. But it seems better to use a standard, commonly available, emwell documentedem template to solve the problem. I would prefer to avoid STL but if theres an STL solution, I would be interested. p  pstrongEditstrong Im looking for, at the least, emorders of magnitudeem  strongnotstrong emjust the firstem but the 1st, the 10th, the 100th emordered by weightem on up to the end the internal ordering of a heap data structure would be great but I dont see any functions that directly access this.

Negative 16611 pAfter seeing a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions118984howcanyouprogramifyoureblindthis questiona, I got to thinking about the various challenges that blind programmers face, and how some of them are applicable even to sighted programmers. Particularly, the problem of reading source code aloud gives me pause. I have been programming for most of my life, and I frequently tutor fellow students in programming, most often in C or Java.p  pIt is emuniquelyem aggravating to try to verbally convey the essential syntax of a C expression. The speaker must give either an idiomatic translation into English, or a full specification of the code in verbal longhand, using explicit yet slow terms such as opening parenthesis, bitwise and, et cetera. Neither of these solutions is optimal.p  pOn the one hand, an idiomatic translation is only useful to a programmer who can detranslate back into the relevant programming codewhich is not usually the case when tutoring a student. In turn, education or simply getting someone up to speed on a project is the most common situation in which source is read aloud, and there is a very small margin for error.p  pOn the other hand, a literal specification is aggravatingly slow. It takes far far longer to say pound, include, left angle bracket, iostream, right angle bracket, newline than it does to simply type codeinclude ltiostreamgtcode. Indeed, most experienced C programmers would read this merely as include iostream, but again, inexperienced programmers abound and literal specifications are sometimes necessary.p  pSo Ive had an idea for a potential solution to this problem.p  pIn C, there is a finite set of a hrefhttpwww.learncpp.comcpptutorial22keywordsandnamingidentifiers relnofollowkeywordsa63and a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiOperatorsinCandC2B2B relnofollowoperatorsa54, discounting named operators and treating compound assignment operators and prefix versus postfix autoincrement and decrement as distinct. There are just a few types of literal, a similar number of grouping symbols, and the semicolon. Unless Im utterly mistaken, thats about it.p  pSo would it not then be feasible to simply ascribe a concise, unique empronunciationem to each of these distinct concepts including one for whitespace, where it is required and go from there Programming languages are far more regular than natural languages, so the pronunciation could be standardised. Speakers of emanyem language would be able to verbally convey C code, and due to the regularity and fixity of the language, speechtotext software could be optimised to accept C speech with a high degree of accuracy.p  pSo my question is twofold first, is my solution feasible and second, does anyone else have other potential solutions I intend to take suggestions from here and use them to produce a formal paper with an example implementation of my solution.p

Negative 16611 pThis is related to the question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2035568whydostackstypicallygrowdownwardsWhy do stacks typically grow downwardsa, but more from a security point of view.  Im generally referring to x86.p  pIt strikes me as odd that the stack would grow downwards, when buffers are usually written to upwards in memory.  For example a typical C string has its end at a higher memory address than the beginning.p  pThis means that if theres a buffer overflow youre overwriting further up the call stack, which I understand is a security risk, since it opens the possibility of changing return addresses and local variable contents.p  pIf the stack grew upwards in memory, wouldnt buffer overflows simply run in to dead memory  Would this improve security  If so, why hasnt it been done  What about x64, do those stacks grow upwards and if not why notp

Negative 16611 pAs inp  precodepublic class MyClass     private static var MyProp  new item1  a, item2  b   codepre  pNote The above doesnt compile nor work the var cannot be used there, its only to show my point.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Just to clarify the question, I had already tried usingp  precodeprivate static dynamic MyProp  new item1  a, item2  b codepre  pand this works, but it doesnt generate intellisense because of the dynamic typing. I am aware that anonymous typing is just a compiler trick, so I hoped I could use this trick to my advantage by declaring a structured field without having to declare a class beforehand mainly because theres only going to be one instance of this particular kind of field. I can see now that its not possible, but Im not sure why that is. If the compiler is simply generating an implicit type for an anonymous object, it should be fairly simply to have the compiler generate this implicit type for a field.p

Negative 16611 pI have a DataGridView bound to a BindingSource, which is in turn bound to a custom implementation of IBindingList that provides sorting.  My DataGridView columns are set to support Automatic sorting.  The behavior I would expect is that the first time I click on a column header, the list will be sorted by the corresponding column subject to my ApplySortCore logic in the ascending direction and the sort direction icon will appear indicating an ascending direction.  I would expect that a second click would result in a descending search and the direction icon to switch reflecting the new direction.p  pWhat is happening is that the first time I click a column, the list is sorted in the ascending direction by that column, but the sort direction icon does not appear.  The second time I click the column header, an ascending sort is again requested confirmed with a breakpoint in ApplySortCore, and the ascending sort direction icon appears in the column header.  The third time I click the column header, a descending sort is requested, but the ascending sort icon still appears in the column header.  The fourth time I click, another descending sort is requested and the descending sort icon appears.  The cycle continues such that the actual sort direction changes every other click and the sort direction icon lags the actual sort direction change by one click.p  pIt seems like the DataGridView or the BindingSource is not correctly keeping track of the sort direction and is thus incorrectly requesting sorts of the IBindingList ApplySortCore method.p  pThe IBindingList implementation I am using is descended from this abstract classp  precodeinternal abstract class CustomSortableBindingListltTgt  BindingListltTgt      private bool misSorted     private ListSortDirection msortDirection     private PropertyDescriptor msortProperty     private IComparerltTgt mcurrentComparer      protected CustomSortableBindingList                protected CustomSortableBindingListIListltTgt items          baseitems                protected override void ApplySortCorePropertyDescriptor property, ListSortDirection direction              var comparer  GetComparerproperty, direction          Sortcomparer         msortDirection  direction         msortProperty  property         CurrentComparer  comparer           protected abstract IComparerltTgt GetComparerPropertyDescriptor property, ListSortDirection direction      protected override void RemoveSortCore              misSorted  false           protected override bool SupportsSortingCore              get  return true            protected override bool IsSortedCore              get  return misSorted            protected override ListSortDirection SortDirectionCore              get  return msortDirection            protected override PropertyDescriptor SortPropertyCore              get  return msortProperty            public IComparerltTgt CurrentComparer              get  return mcurrentComparer          set  mcurrentComparer  value            public void SortIComparerltTgt comparer              var items  Items as ListltTgt         if null  items ampamp null  comparer                      items.Sortcomparer             misSorted  true             CurrentComparer  comparer                  else                      misSorted  false                   Let bound controls know they should refresh their views         OnListChangednew ListChangedEventArgsListChangedType.Reset, 1                   codepre  pThe GetComparer method of the concrete class simply contains a switch statement based on the name specified in the property descriptor, returning the correct IComparerp  precodeprotected override IComparerltHostListItemgt GetComparerPropertyDescriptor property, ListSortDirection direction              switch property.Name                      case SomeProperty                 return new SomePropertyComparerdirection, CurrentComparer              default                 return null               codepre  pThe CurrentComparer property is used to support a nested sort.p  pIve tried binding the DataGridView directly to the IBindingList cutting out the BindingSource, since it doesnt seem like its really providing any additional functionality, but nothing changes.p  pDoes anybody have any idea why the DataGridView seems to be failing to display the correct sort direction icons or to provide the correct sort direction to the sort callsp

Negative 16611 pStack is warning me this is a subjective question, and will likely be close, but Im going to try this anyway.p  pI have a set of control buttons attached to pictures in a gallery.  These are to be initially hidden, and toggle visible when the mouse hovers over the image.  The question I have is thisp  pShould these buttons be set to hidden in the stylesheet or stay visible and be hidden by jQuery when they load  I want graceful degradation, so it seems like initializing this in the CSS is a bad idea if I want these to be visible if javascript isnt enabled.p  pOn top of this, Im using Ajax to load pages of these images.  If I do this using the jQuery hide, it doesnt affect those that load from an ajax request, since it only triggers on codedocument.readycode.  Ive tried using codelivereadycode, but learned that that event isnt supported in codelivecode.  p  pSo what is the best practice for something like this It seems like theres a lot of pros and cons for doing this either way css vs. document.ready, and if theyre hidden by the default CSS, the buttons will toggle fine with ajax pagination.  But if javascript isnt enabled, the functionality of the buttons will be lost.  Does anyone have advice for thisp  pNote I didnt mention it originally, but it is significant. Im currently using codefadeTogglecode to accomplish my transition, which may be whats complicating this whole issue. The solutions so far all appear to work, but not so much when fading is introduced.p

I have isolated the timesink to xulrunner generatingworking with profile information.p  pI have tried adding codeprofile pathtostaticfoldercode and codeprofile pathtotemporaryfoldercode but each still has a very long delay 30  60 seconds, on a fast computer.  I have also added codenoremotecode but with no effect.p  pWhen the application launches, I can watch the profile folder slowly fill with files, and once all the files are there, the gui comes up fairly quickly.

Negative 16611 pwe are facing a very strange problem with our application, until now i see no option to solve the problemp  pThe application uses NHibernate 3.1.x in an sessionperconversation architecture, meaning at startend of each ASPIIS request a NHibernate session with a new transaction is openedclosed  flushedcommitted.p  pNow, we have a mailbox in the application including a simple mailgrid The mailgrid is populated first time when a user enters the mailbox startRequest creates a new NHibernate sessiontransaction, loads stuff from DB, on endRequest the session is closedp  pThe problem occurs at the deletion of a mailp  p1 the deletion of mails does not happen via a full pagereloadrefresh, instead it calls a webservice which returns the new rendered HTML grid after a message is deleted. This webservice deletes a mail by doing a simplep  precodeTMails m  TMails.GetMailByID 12345678  m.Status  MailStatusDeleted NHibernateSession.Update m  codepre  p2 After this call to update the mail, the same function also rerenders the updated mailgrid  it does this by querying for the last 5 rows in table TMails one mailbox page contains only 5 rows then, this is the current content of the mailbox for a given user.p  pThe problem now is Since both of these calls occur in the same function of the webservice and thus in the same sessiontransaction scope, the mail we want to delete in step 1, is not deleted since the updated status from NHibernateSession.Update m  does not reach the database. p  pIf i open the table via MSSQL ManagementStudio while a debugging session i can see that the status of the mail is not persited to database.p  pMy simple solution for this problem would be Doing a manual NHibernateSession.Flush call between updating the mail and reloading the content from the table But this would break the sessionperconversation pattern, since NhibernateSession.Flush isshould occuring at the end of each request  its not ought to be called manually somewhere in the running request.p  pOtherwise im really stuck.p

Negative 16611 pIm working on app, which sends and receives JSON data using NSURLConnection, but I have this connection and its delagate methods inside viewcontroller, and thats not correct for MVC I guess. Ive wanted separated class for whole connection, but there was problem that I couldnt detect then in viewcontroller, when the connection finished loading, so I couldnt get received data. What is the correct way to do this p  pHowever, this hole non MVC NSURLConnection inside viewcontrollers works fine for my app, except one case  when I need to use tableview, which is part of viewcontroller  which is also datasource and delegate for this tableview. It seems like tableview is trying to create cells, before connection finished loading, which is little bit weird I think, because in method tableViewnumberOfRowsInSection I already have data I need, and I thought that this method is called before Im configuring cell in tableViewCellForRowAtIndexPath ...but Im wrong probably. Can somebody explain me whats going on here and how to solve this  also the first part with correct using of MVC with NSURLConnectionp

Negative 16611 pWere having some really strange problems with IE7, and only IE7. When trying to replicate the issue it only happens with native IE7, not when running IE7 mode in IE89, so please remember that if you try to replicate this issue.p  pThe problem is the followingp  pWere polling for a response from the server with AJAX. The user posts something that the server may have to work on for a bit, so every 5 seconds or so a request is sent check if the server is done. This works fine in every browser, except native IE7. The problem is that it never stops loading. When checking the requests with Fiddler2 we see that it does two requests and then nothing more. It stops doing anything when still in PENDING mode. In a sain browser it keeps on polling, and then stops when it gets CONFIRMED. The really weird thing is that it does its final request and returns as normal, only, and really only, when you strongopen a new tabstrong.p  pIts not that the page needs focus or anything, clicking around randomly does nothing. Im asking here because I cant even reproduce the issue using a local instance of the project.p  pHere are the headers sent back by the serverp  pThese are the headers for the response on the production machine. This was the last response gotten. It loads indefinitely until you open a new tab just an empty new tab, then the final request is made and everything works out.p  precodeHTTP1.1 200 OK AcceptRanges bytes Age 0 CacheControl maxage0, private, mustrevalidate ContentType applicationjson charsetutf8 Date Tue, 04 Oct 2011 073745 GMT ETag 867dafc628c43b6ca8a73d1977669250 P3P CPALL DSP COR CURa ADMa DEVa OUR IND COM NAV Server nginx1.0.6 SetCookie websessionCOOKIE path expiresTue, 04Oct2011 103745 GMT HttpOnly Vary AcceptEncoding Via 1.1 varnish XCache MISS XRuntime 0.062794 XUACompatible IEEdge,chrome1 XVarnish 55900984 ContentLength 145 Connection keepalive  directpublishingsettingsid9970,confirmedPENDING,errors,username,url,blogid44606,platformbloggse codepre  pThese are the headers for the same request on my local server.

Unfortunately, Im not sure what, if anything the web service was doing to manipulate the data sentreceived from the DB.p  pIn 10g, the string returned from the NCLOB column was Big Endian Unicode, and all r were dropped, so new lines would return as a n.p  pIn 11g, the string returned from the NCLOB is ASCII encoded, and all r were strongreplacedstrong with n, so new lines return as nn. p  pDoes this seem reasonable Honestly, weve been handling Oracle newline issues for a while the behavior of 10g, and Im pretty sure that this is a result of upgrading to 11g.

Negative 16611 pOk, so I have a php soap client which calls a method and obtains some information correctly, it can grab simple types like strings or even objects, but when it goes to an array of some type in this case Strings it always comes back as an empty object.  I tried casting it to array and many other things, but every option I use it always returns the same thing.p  pHere is some background informationp  pThis is a web service which I created in java using the help of eclipse.  I also autogenerated a java client to test the web service prior to creating the client in php.  I created multiple test cases which used the auto generated java client the proxy class and successfully returned the correct expected value.  Another words, java had no trouble grabbing this array of strings and showing me each value.  I did this to determine if the problem was serverside or clientside and so far its pointing more towards the clientside.p  pNext, phps soap client has a nice feature where if you set the options to include trace  1 you can call getLastResponse to see what the response xml looks like, so here it isp  precodelt xml version1.0 encodingutf8gt lt soapenvEnvelope xmlnssoapenvhttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgsoapenvelope xmlnsxsdhttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchema xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstancegt     lt soapenvBodygt         lt getAllCarClassesIdsAsWsCarClassIdsResponse xmlnsXgt             lt getAllCarClassesIdsAsWsCarClassIdsReturngt                 lt carClassIdsgt                     lt carClassIdsgtXlt carClassIdsgt                     lt carClassIdsgtXlt carClassIdsgt                     lt carClassIdsgtXlt carClassIdsgt                     lt carClassIdsgtXlt carClassIdsgt                     lt carClassIdsgtXlt carClassIdsgt                     lt carClassIdsgtXlt carClassIdsgt                     lt carClassIdsgtXlt carClassIdsgt                     lt carClassIdsgtXlt carClassIdsgt                     lt carClassIdsgtXlt carClassIdsgt                     lt carClassIdsgtXlt carClassIdsgt                 lt carClassIdsgt             lt getAllCarClassesIdsAsWsCarClassIdsReturngt         lt getAllCarClassesIdsAsWsCarClassIdsResponsegt     lt soapenvBodygt lt soapenvEnvelopegt codepre  pPlease note that certain values have been replaced with an X for security purposes.

Negative 16611 pFor some background information, Im creating an application that searches against a couple of indexed tables to retrieve some records. It isnt overtly complex to the point of say Google, but its good enough for the purpose it serves, barring this strange issue. p  pIm using the codeContainscode function, and its going very well, except when the search contains strings of numbers. Now, Im only passing in a string  nowhere numerical datatypes being passed in  only characters. Were searching against a collection of emails, each appended with a custom ID when shot off from a workflow. So while testing, we decided to search via number strings. p  pIn our test, we isolated a number code0042600006code, which belongs to one and only one email subject. However, when using our query we are getting results for code0042600001code, code0042600002code, etc. The query is this as follows with some generic columns standing inp  pcodeSELECT description, subject FROM tableA WHERE CONTAINSsubject, 0042600006codep  pWeve tried every possible combination code0042600006code, code0042600006code and code0042600006code. p  pI think its just a limitation of the function, but I thought this would probably be the best place for answers.

Negative 16611 pI know this question has been asked before, but I have yet to find a true solution. I have a codeUITableViewcode with a codeUISearchBarcode as its codetableHeaderView.code Whenever the scope buttons appear, they cover the first row of the codeUITableViewcode. p  pI have tried using codeUITableView.contentOffsetcode to offset the codeUITableViewcode by the height of the scope buttons, and this works until the user taps the codeUITableViewcode or scrolls it, at which point the codeUITableViewcode jumps back to its original offset.p  pThe best Ive been able to do is set the codeUISearchBarcode as a separate item in the view, and simply resize the codeUITableViewcode dynamically to show or hide it when the user taps a search button. The only problem is that there is no animation, so the transition is sharp. p  pUPDATE I solved the problem by implementing a codeUISearchDisplayControllercode, as this was the cleanest and easiest solution to work with. The codeUISearchDisplayControllercode automatically showshides the scope buttons and moves the codeUITableViewcode down accordingly. I didnt do this at first because I wanted the codeUITableViewcode to remain visible rather than initially being blacked out by the codeUISearchDisplayControllercode, however Ive come to realize that the blackout does not hinder any functionality the user would not have initiated a search if he wanted to continue looking at the codeUITableViewcode the way it was.p
Negative 16611 pI use Developer Expresss CodeRush product which has a feature called Code Issues which makes suggestions to optimize your code.

Negative 16611 pI created a branch based on my remote originmaster, and I pushed that new branch to the remote as origintester and updated my local branch to merge with that new remote instead of originmaster.p  pAfter the master got a few commits that I needed a new file testfile was added, I ran with my local tester branch checked outp  precodegit fetch origin git rebase originmaster git push origin tester codepre  pAnd all was well.

Then, more changes were made on both branches nonconflicting changes in separate files.  So, I didp  precodegit fetch origin git rebase originmaster codepre  pand I get a conflict, saying that both have added testfile.

Do I remove the mean on an attribute by attribute basis, or do I remove the mean of all attributes from eachp  pFor example, if the mean of attribute A was 500, and the mean of attribute B was 1,000. For all values in A I could remove 500, which gives the A attribute a mean of 0. Then I could do the same for attribute B.p  pORp  pI could take 750 off all values for both attributes.p  pWhich is more statistically correctp  pMy question is due to this If I subtract different values from the different attributes, the attributes are then no longer comparable as different amount have been taken from each. If I subtract the same value from all, then some columns may be full of just negative figures  and so negating the effect of mean centering .p  pThanks,p
Negative 16611 pI have a Django project that, on one page, has multiple forms in different  tags that can be submitted to have different effects.

Negative 16611 pMe and my colleagues developing an application both web application and mobile appiPhone amp android, which includes a login process.  Currently, we have our own login mechanism where users have signed for an account on our app, and have stored their info in our Database. We are looking into integrating oAuth and allowing users to login with Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google.p  pNow, when the users logs with any of those, as I understand the login process occurs outside our application and basically only get permission to access their resources. p  pMy question is this through oAuth, how do we remember users i.e., users who login have read write privileges and have preferences. How do we remember those when they dont actually sign up through our app.. Can we store their email address in our Users tablep  pWhat are the best practices in such a scenariop  pThanks for any info you can provide.p

Negative 16611 pI currently have a codemetriccode model, that can take two codeoperandscode and perform a calculation based on its codeoperationtypecode, producing a result through the custom result method. This is working as expected.p  pIn order to make this scalable, I would like to be able to use two operands as currently, one operand and one metric, or two metrics to perform the calculation. The reason for this is that it is then scalable  I can use the results of previous operations.p  pWhere I am stuck is how to create this self join  I imagine that I need to go down the road of a polymorphic self reference somehow, but the documentation is not leading me to the answer. I have currently got a setup with a codecalculatedmetriccode model in addition, but im not sure if this is the way to go.p  pMy models look as followsp  precodeclass Metric lt ActiveRecordBase     attraccessible name, operationtypeid end  class Operand lt ActiveRecordBase     attraccessible object, attribute end  class Calculatedmetric lt ActiveRecordBase     attraccessible metricid, calculatedmetricid end codepre  pAny assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thanksp  pEDIT Perhaps I can clarify this a little I currently have a separate codecalculatedmetriccode model is this the best approach to take in order to use the results of another metric in my calculation, or could I achieve this more simply by adding a codeleftmetriccode and coderightmetriccode to my existing codemetriccode table left and right are so that if the equation is a subtraction, for example, it knows which one is being taken away Im not sure if this is an ideal solution, as they will be null in a large number of cases.p

However, it does not update the contents as it should of the file.p  pExample If I changed the write string below to Goodbye World and reran the script, nothing in the freesample7.php file would change, it will still remain Hello World.... p  pAs a fix I tried deleting the file and then recreating it every time the script is ran, however, this did not fix the problem, the contents of the file remain the same as from the first time the file was written to.p  pI was wondering if there is a way to get around this issue as I desperately need to figure out a way to write to a file and update the content of that particular file periodically.p  precodeunlink..htmlfreesample7.php sleep20 fileputcontents..htmlfreesample7.php,Hello World.

Negative 16611 pI am developing a multiplatform Android, iPhone, Windows and Blacbberry mobile application. The application needs to communicate with our server for several tasks, such as retrieving buddy lists etc. The server interacts with data that is stored in a MySQL database. I intend to code the server element in Java, however I am confused by all the different types. So far, I think I have narrowed it down to three optionsp  p1 I code the application using Jetty to accept http posts. I post XML to the server, handle it, interact with the DB and post a XML response back. I would save the application as a jar and leave it running on my server.p  p2I develop a Java web service. RESTJSONSOAPp  p3I develop a Java web application.p  pWhilst there are many questions already out there asking what the differences is, I am struggling to find a clear explanation as to what is the best approach in which situation. I have previously used the first approach but am assuming the second approach is the better option, Im just not sure what the advantage is.p

Negative 16611 pAlright Ive been trying to learn Dojo here today and I just cant seem to figure out why I cant fade in my elements. What Im doing here is loading a set of images from a json object and putting them in the DOM. I then want to fade them in one at a time using an array and the shift method. This is a working plugin I wrote in jQuery and am using as a crash course for Dojo. The wierd thing is that I cant get the fade animation to work at all, even if I strip away the array and just try to target a single DOM element, but if I paste in one of the examples from a hrefhttpdojotoolkit.orgreferenceguide1.8dojobasefx.htmldojobasefxfadein relnofollowherea directly into my webpage, that works.p  pHeres the codep  precodedefine[     dojoquery, dojodomclass, dojodomReady, dojorequest, dojojson, dojobasefx, dojoon, dojodomattr, dojodomstyle ],           functionquery, domClass, dom, request, fx, on, domAttr          var images  new Array The array object created from the XML file         var curfirst  0 Current first image, used as a counter to determine which images should be shown         var running  true Flag to prevent multiple firings or nextprev         var displaynum  4 Num of images displayed at a time          request.get....javascriptjsonrotatorimages.js,handleAsjson.then                 functionresponse                     fori0 i lt response.images.image.length i                         var src  response.images.image[i].src                         var title  response.images.image[i].title                         var desc  response.images.image[i].desc                         var thumb  response.images.image[i].thumb                         images[i]src src, title title, desc desc, thumb thumb                                          loadimages                                        function loadimages             fori0 i lt images.length i                 ifi gt curfirst ampamp i lt curfirstdisplaynum                     dojo.creatediv,                          innerHTMLlta classfancybox relgroup hrefimages[i].srcgtltimg srcimages[i].thumb gtltagt,                         classNamerimage,                         styleopacity0,                         idrimagei1                     ,dojo.byIdimageswrap                                           displayimages                   function remainder             Find the remaining images left at the end inside our displaynum control so we can determine when to start back at 0 or jump to the end             var flr  Math.floorimages.length  displaynum             return images.length  flrdisplaynum                          queryarrowr.onclick, function             ifrunning  false                 running  true                 ifcurfirst lt images.length  remainder                     curfirst  curfirstdisplaynum                 else                     curfirst  0                                  hideimages                                queryarrowl.onclick, function             ifrunning  false                 running  true                 ifcurfirst gt 1                     curfirst  curfirstdisplaynum                     hideimages                 else                     curfirst  images.length  remainder                     hideimages                                                  function displayimages             var imagesarr  []             dojo.query.rimage.forEachfunctionnode                  imagesarr.pushnode                          function fadeThemInimagesarr                  if imagesarr.length gt 0                      var currentImg  imagesarr.shift                     var fadeArgs                           node currentImg,                         duration 200,                                          fx.fadeInfadeArgs.play                 else                     running  false                                           fadeThemInimagesarr                 codepre  pSorry about just dumping the entire code into here but I figure it has to be something with Dojos AMD amd how the modules are being loaded which I find a headache at this point. p

Negative 16611 pIm developing a simple app for some students. In the app, a student has to select a video which they made in iMovie. Ive already set up a NSOpenPanel for this, but I would like it to default to the movies directory, but not the codeMoviescode directory, Im aiming for the movies directory underneath the media title in Finder. It is a pretty handy directory, because the students will be able to import videos directly from iMovie, instead of having to export and search for them.

Negative 16611 pSavon is stubborn in generating SOAP envelopes from WSDLs. It does it improperly and I see no way to fix it.

Negative 16611 pI have a problem I cant find out myself so any help appreciated. p  pI have a dynamic cart which is filled with some JSON data. In the cart the shipping costs are also filled from the same json data. The script itself works when a method is available. When a shipping method isnt available for that country the script should say not available or something like that. Instead it returns an undefined error which causes the cart not to work. After some searching I found out that when an user comes from country A which is supported by the cart the variable methods is present in the Json string. When a user comes from country B which isnt supported the variable methods is not present in the json string. Obviously that causes the error.  So what I try to achieve is to check if the variable methods is present or not.

Negative 16611 pMost of my programming prior to Python was in C or Matlab. I dont have a degree in CS almost completed a PhD in physics, but have done some courses and a good amount of actual programming. Now, Im taking an algorithms course on Coursera excellent course, by the way, with a professor from Stanford. I decided to implement the homeworks in Python. However, sometimes I find myself wanting things the language does not so easily support. Im very used to creating classes and objects for things in C just to group together data i.e. when there are no methods. In Python however, where you can add fields on the fly, what I basically end up wanting all the time are Matlab structs. I think this is possibly a sign I am not using good style and doing things the Pythonic way. p  pUnderneath is my implementation of a unionfind data structure for Kruskals algorithm. Although the implementation is relatively short and works well there isnt much error checking, there are a few odd points. For instance, my code assumes that the data originally passed in to the unionfind is a list of objects. However, if a list of explicit pieces of data are passed in instead i.e. a list of ints, the code fails. Is there some much clearer, more Pythonic way to implement this I have tried to google this, but most examples are very simple and relate more to procedural code i.e. the proper way to do a for loop in python.p  precodeclass UnionFind     def initself,data         self.data  data          for d in self.data             d.size  1             d.leader  d             d.next  None             d.last  d      def findself,element         return element.leader      def unionself,leader1,leader2         if leader1.size gt leader2.size             newleader  leader1             oldleader  leader2         else             newleader  leader2             oldleader  leader1          newleader.size  leader1.size  leader2.size          d  oldleader         while d  None             d.leader  newleader             d  d.next          newleader.last.next  oldleader         newleader.last  oldleader.last          deloldleader.size         deloldleader.last     codepre

Negative 16611 pFrom the Ruby on Rails documentationp  blockquote   pThe first feature of the pipeline is to concatenate assets. This is   important in a production environment, because it can reduce the   number of requests that a browser must make to render a web page. Web   browsers are limited in the number of requests that they can make in   parallel, so fewer requests can mean faster loading for your   application.p blockquote  pThis is widely considered a best practice around the web. But doesnt conventional logic tell us that loading even three files in parallel is faster than loading a concatenated version serially. So even if there is an upper limit on the number of parallel connections, it should be faster than waiting for one huge file on a single connection. Or does it have to do with the overhead for each requestp

Negative 16611 pI am going ot develop a full version, lite version and free version of an app. or two of them at leastp  pIn the past, without Storyboard, I just added another target and set a compiler variable and used ifelseendif statements to manage the variances between the versions. All fine so far. p  pThis time I used a storyboard for the first time. It has some 50 view controllers. And now I am facing the question how to deal with that. Especially as the full app is tab bar based and the lite version should go without tab bar it will cover not more than the functionality corresponding to one of the tabs of the full version. p  pHow can I deal with this Do I need a second storyboard Will I be able to reuse views from storyboard 1 in storyboard 2 and 3 Or can I at least use a second storyboard as starting point only and then branch into parts of storyboard 1 Again, the lite app will mainly consist of functionality that is within one of the tabs of the full app. p  pFrankly I donnot even know where to start. That is why I cannot share what I have tried so far.  Any hint is appreciated. p

Our Sofanatics coverage this past week has been one of the                      few times weve covered abandoned projects, which is a pitty because there are a                      lot to learn from failures. Below we have a long read from Eero Holmila which                      is one part eulogy, and another part what hes learned from the nowannounced                      shutdown of Qaiku.com.Qaiku.com might be a familiar name for some of the                      readers of Arctic Startup. However, I am quite sure that the background and the                      rough road from high hopes to a bitter decline probably is not. I am the CEO of                      Rohea, a company behind a handful of quite successful Finnish websites like                      Kotikokki.net, Kuvake.net, Mikseri.net and of course a less successful                      Qaiku.com.I am going to share some lessons learned through the trip. I hope                      some of it might be of use, spark up ideas or if nothing else, be at least a bit                      entertaining. One last important disclaimer all the opinions are my own.Now                      without further delay, this is the story of                      Qaiku.                 ltipxmlgt            ltipInputgt                codepre

No session is ever created. Whats even stranger is that the facebook id that is inserted into the fbid column in the DB belongs to an account that belongs to a test account that FB uses to test open graph actions that are submitted for approval. I know because after taking a deeper look at the DB, I saw a row in the DB that belonged to an FB open graph actions testers. The ID is 2147483647. That is clearly not the ID that is printed out when I printed out the userprofile array. Furthermore, after the first time the page is reloaded, an insert query shouldnt even occur because the rowCount returned is set to 1. The insert query is only supposed to be executed if the user is a first time user. Sandbox mode isnt on. I thought might have had something to do with it.

I try to do something similar to obtain the text in the textInput but nothing is working.p  pWhat I  am doing is I add an event listener to the TextInput, so when the user types something, I can extract that information.p  pI appreciate the help. p  precodeltsButton idagregar x36 y533 labelAgregar mas mensajes  fontSize20   clickagregarclickHandlereventgt  ltsScroller x36 y99 width554 height400gt     ltsVGroup width100 height100 idscrollergt     ltsVGroupgt ltsScrollergt          protected function agregarclickHandlereventMouseEventvoid                       TODO Autogenerated method stub             var groupHGroup  new HGroup             group.width  552              group.height  65               var inputTextInput  new TextInput              input.width  360             input.height  49              input.addEventListenerTextOperationEvent.CHANGE, actualizar              var numNumericStepper  new NumericStepper             num.width  107             num.height  49             num.maximum  100               var delButton  new Button              del.width  70              del.height  49              del.label  delete             del.setStyleicon, deleteicon              del.addEventListenerMouseEvent.CLICK, eliminar                group.addElementinput             group.addElementnum              group.addElementdel               scroller.addElementgroup            protected function eliminareventMouseEventvoid                      scroller.removeElementHGroupButtonevent.currentTarget.parent           protected function actualizareventTextOperationEventvoid                      var objObject  scroller.getElementIndexHGroupTextInputevent.currentTarget.parent           codepre

Negative 16611 pFrom what I understand, instructions and data in an object file all have addresses.

Line A, in the example below, would be in the relocation table. I dont think B would be in the relocation table, since the address of label equal is relative to B. Are these correct assumptionsp  pI know the symbol table show the labels the file have and also labels that havent been resolved.

But when I change the language to German codedeDEcode in the DotNetNuke settings, the value of codenowcode becomes  code3152013 22033 AMcode.

Negative 16611 pIm using AmplifyJS Store. I think its a good wrapper for persistent storage. Ive been using it in a JQuery plugin and it works pretty well.p  pLately though, Ive been wondering if I can just do the same thing using a namespace variable in the codewindowcode objectp  pAmplifyJS Store  JSON2.js required for data serialization costs me 22Kb 8Kb minified of file size alone, not to mention the additional supporting code Ive had to create around it. Also, Im using only sessionStorage i.e. I have no need for persistence after the browser window closes, only while the window is active.  p  pSo, is there really any major reason I cant use the codewindowcode object instead of AmplifyJS Store for my specific circumstance Ive thought about the codeexpirycode feature but I can easily build in same functionality in a few lines of code.p  pThanks.p

Negative 16611 pI am developing a fuzzy search mechanism. I have car brandsmodels and cities in database mysqlenglish and russian names  about 1000 items. User can enter this words with mistakes or in translit. Now I am retrieving all these words from db and compare each word in loop with user entered word using livenstein distance and other functions. Is there any way to generate many forms of each word car brandsmodels  words with mistakes, because I want to retrieve these words from db using like sql operator. For example I have car brand Toyota and I want to generate  Tokota, Tobota, Toyoba, Tayota, , ,  russian  many many forms of each word. And user can enter any of this word and I can find that it is Toyota he means.p

Negative 16611 pIve read through a bunch of answers to this question, and tried some different variants of them myself as well, but so far I havent managed to find anything that satisfied WebStorm. The code in question looks something like thisp  precodevar slice  Array.prototype.slice     param function func The original function.   param ... args Bound argument values.   returns function The partially applied function   function partialfunc  args       var args  slice.callarguments, 1     return function          return func.applythis, args.concatslice.callarguments       codepre  pThe above code triggers a warning saying Parameter args described in JSDoc does not appear in function signature. Internally in WebStorm, they have some JS files similarly annotated to support autocompletion for things like Function.prototype.call, but those are used only as libraries. As such, they can have whatever in their signature, so they just add an extra argument at the end for this would be args in this case. In regular code, thats not really an option, though.p  pIs there any form of this syntax that WebStorm actually accepts without complaints, or is this just a bugmissing featurep

Negative 16611 pIm a student programmer and Ive landed a task at my job to develop a software system to monitor when employees clock in, clock out, and log the times. The employees will use a keypad attached to a computer at the front desk to enter their employee id into a gui which will clock them inout. Theres another gui the office manager will use to monitor employee in and outs, and keep track of whos in the office. p  pThe project is a windows form project in VS 2010, with two guis as mentioned, and an Access 2007 database to store the data. The office manager gui has a DataGridView object that Id like to populate with the employee name, and time she clocks in or out. I would like for this to happen in real time. In other words, once the employee clocks in, it populates in the office managers gui. What Im looking for is the best practice to this approach. Should I take a clientserver approach Should I have something trigger from the  database to alert the office manager gui to fire an event to get the clock inout time of the employee populated into the office managers DataGridViewp  pThe database and queries have all been designed. Im just looking for the best practice to approach this problem. Im a junior level college student and I come to stackoverflow.com all the time. This is my first question, so either way this is a big step for me  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 16611 pIm new to MVC 5 and trying to get my head around the new Identity membership system, so forgive my newbieignorance on the subject. p  pMy goal... Restrict data sent back to the user to make sure its the users data.  I am using Entity Framework and have a set of APIs exposing data for a SPA app.  On top of adding [Authorize] to the APIs, I need to of course also make sure the data getting retrieved is only the users data, e.g. if I have a travel site, I only want to return that users reservations not all in the system.p  pWhat I have done so far... I started a new MVC project so I can use the Identity membership.  Next, I added my existing model and data layers that contain my model for the reservation system.  Success... all working as it should.  In the database, I see all of my travel site tables, a set of AspnetUser tables and a set of Identity tables. Next up, link the reservation entities to the users.  p  pSo, in my model, I create links to what I think is going to be the AspNetUsers entitiestables as this is where both external and regular users are stored  for me only external users, fbgoogleetc, are stored in the Identity tables in several of my classesp  precodepublic class Reservation   ... properties ...         Add FK to link reservation to user                [ForeignKeyUser] public string UserId  get set  public virtual ApplicationUser User  get set    codepre  p... and, Im using the standard IdentityModel.cs file...p  precodepublic class ApplicationUser  IdentityUser codepre  p... but, instead, its linking to the Identity tables.  So, this does not work...p  precodepublic IQueryableltReservationgt Reservations                 var sUserId  getUserId   fctn below                repository.Reservations.Wherer gt r.UserId  sUserId   codepre  pThis foreign key is linked to the IdentityUser table, not the AspnetUser table.  If the user is a locally registered user, not one using an external login fbgoogleetc, the system only adds the user in the AspnetUser table, not the IdentityUser table.  This means I cant just add the users Id to the data table because the foreign key isnt valid as the users Id isnt in the IdentityUser table.  I quickly added this function for testing in my API controller for testingp  precodeprivate string getUserId      UserManagerltApplicationUsergt UserManager  new UserManagerltApplicationUsergtnew UserStoreltApplicationUsergtnew ApplicationDbContext     if User.Identity.GetUserId  null              return User.Identity.GetUserId          else              return        codepre  pSo, my question is what should I be doing here to achieve my desired result of associating data to users  Should the foreign keytable be to something different  Am I taking an incorrect approach in adding foreign key relationships back to the user tablesp
Negative 16611 pWe have a drupal 7 website, getting about 50.000 unique visitors each day.

Negative 16611 pI have created a pivot table to summarize some information and have added some formulas adjacent to the pivot table to do calculations on the numbers included in it.

Negative 16611 pIm currently planing an application brainstorming, more or less, designed to be used in small organizations. The app will require syncronization w a backendserver, e.g. for user management and some advanced, centralized functionality. This server has to be hosted locally and should be able to run on Linux, Mac and Windows. I havent decided how Im going to realize this, mainly I simply dont know which would be the smartest approach.p  pTechnically speaking, a very interessting approach seemed to be node.js  mongoose, connecting to a local MongoDB. But this is where Im struggeling How do I ensure that its easy and convienient for a organizations IT to set this up p  pInstalling node.js  MongoDB is tedious work and far from standartized and easy. I dont have the ressources to provide a detailled walthrough for every major OS and configuration or do take over the setup myself. Ideally, the local administrator should run some sort of setup on the machine used as server a regular PC running 247 should suffice and have the system up and running, similar to the way some games provide executables for hosting small gameservers for a couple friends Minecraft, for instance.p  pI also thought about Java EE, though I havent dug into an details here. Im unsure about whether this is really an option.p  pMany people suggest to outsource the backend BaaS, e.g. to parse.com or similar services. This is not an option, since its mandatory that the backend will be hosted locally.p  pIm sorry if this question is too unspecific, but unfortunately, I really dont know where to start.p

Negative 16611 pI have a Screen like this which is built in interface builderp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwALbG.png altenter image description herep  pThe control at the bottom is a codeUICollectionViewcode and the other two are a UIButton and a segmentedControl. They sit on a  UIView which is a child of the codeUIControllerscode view but has the same frame.

I can set the auto layout constraint to force the top of this screen to move below the navigationbar.  However when I scroll down the codeUICollectionViewcode I couldnt scroll to the bottom to view the rest of the items. I can only see half size of the last two items.

Negative 16611 pI am trying to create a database for work. I have two different types of users internal and external. Each type has different properties so I just created two separate tables for them. In my internal table I have the following fieldsp  precodefname VARCHAR32, lname VARCHAR32, emplstatusid INT, admingrpid INT, reliabstatusid INT, supvid INT codepre  pAnd my external table has the followingp  precodefname VARCHAR32, lname VARCHAR32, email VARCHAR32, phone VARCHAR20, orgid INT, supvid INT codepre  pI realize that I could probably create a separate table that contains the names of the users and a foreign key pointing to either internal or external, but that aside, I added a foreign key constraint to my internal table that refers codesupvidcode to another internal user. I called it codefksupvidcode. When I tried to do the same for my external user table, I got codeERROR 1005 HY000code. p  pAt first I couldnt figure out what the problem was but when I tried doing it with a different name, it worked i.e. instead of calling it codefksupvidcode just like for internal, I called it codefkxtsupvidcode. p  pSo my question is, what is the correct way to this Its the same foreign key in two different tables. In both cases it refers to an internal user. Is there a way to do this without having two different names Or should I opt for the table of names idea and add the codesupvidcode constraint to that table along with codefnamecode, codelnamecode, and codeusertypecodep  pAdvice and suggestions are appreciated,p  pThanks p

Also Im very confused on how to make something pipe correctly. From my interpretation, I feel like with piped objects, pipe will simply write to the object inside the pipe and then call read on that object. But I havent been able to get pipe to work that well. Maybe when I solve this problem, I can figure out pipe easier. Thanks.p
Negative 16611 pI am programming an android game which users can purchase buildings that are dynamically created once purchased. When they are created, the user can drag and drop them wherever they want to, just as long as it is on the ground.

When the user drags the buildings around, they act as they should until the user tries to drag it into the sky area.

Negative 16611 pSo Ive been building a program that basically calls out to my server and checks the page source code. The only problem is that since I have an infinite loop, So it gets the source code of the server and then at the bottom of the loop it saves the current page code and refreshes the actual page code in a different variable. If theses 2 variables match Nothing has changed Then its going to keep looping through and calling the page and getting the source code over and over again. This works great except that after a while the server thinks it is a DoS attack and wont let me connect. Ive tried making a method where it would be a super long loop, but that seems like a messy way of doing it. My question, is their anyway to tell Java to just completely stop code execution for a set amount of time. So for example it will call the server every 1 or 2 minutesp  precodepackage Mailer2 import java.util.Date import java.util.Properties import java.util.Scanner import java.io.BufferedReader import java.io.IOException import java.io.InputStreamReader import java.net.MalformedURLException import java.net.URL import java.net.URLConnection import java.net.UnknownHostException import java.util.ArrayList  import javax.mail.Authenticator import javax.mail.Message.RecipientType import javax.mail.MessagingException import javax.mail.Multipart import javax.mail.PasswordAuthentication import javax.mail.Session import javax.mail.Transport import javax.mail.internet.AddressException import javax.mail.internet.InternetAddress import javax.mail.internet.MimeBodyPart import javax.mail.internet.MimeMessage import javax.mail.internet.MimeMultipart public class mailer2      static Scanner console  new ScannerSystem.in     public static void mainString[] args throws AddressException, MessagingException, IOException, InterruptedException         System.out.printlnAdmin console         boolean StartServer  true         String old            whileStartServer  true             Thread.sleep10000          Get Info from Page         String From           String To           String Subject           String Body           String Provider           URL GetInfo  new URLhttpsmsmessenger.comuf.comUsers.php          String GetPage  getPageCodeGetInfo         System.out.printlnGot the String  GetPage         String CutDown  GetPage.substring73,GetPage.indexOfltbr         System.out.printlnCutDown         From  CutDown.substring0,CutDown.indexOfTO  From         System.out.printlnFrom         To  CutDown.substringCutDown.indexOfTO  3,CutDown.indexOfSUBJECT  1         System.out.printlnTo         Subject  CutDown.substringCutDown.indexOfSUBJECT  8,CutDown.indexOfBODY         System.out.printlnSubject         Body  CutDown.substringCutDown.indexOfBODY  5, CutDown.indexOfProvider         System.out.printlnBody         Provider  CutDown.substringCutDown.indexOfProvider  9         System.out.printlnProvider           Cell provider check         ifProvider.length  0             System.out.printlnNo Provider Detected                  else ifProvider.toLowerCase.equalssprint             To  messaging.sprintpcs.com             System.out.printlnSprint HERE  To                  else ifProvider.toLowerCase.equalsverizon             To  vtext.com                  else ifProvider.toLowerCase.equalsatt             To  txt.att.net                  else ifProvider.toLowerCase.equalstmobile  Provider.toLowerCase.equalstmobile             To  tmomail.net                  else         System.out.printlnProvider NOT FOUND  Provider                  ifold.equalsGetPage             System.out.printlnSENDING EMAIL         SendEmailFrom,To,Subject,Body                  System.out.printlnSleeping         Thread.sleep100          old  GetPage                       public static void SendEmailString From, String To, String Subject, String Body throws AddressException, MessagingException          Properties prop  new Properties         prop.putmail.smtp.host, ssrs.reachmail.net         prop.putmail.smtp.port, 587         prop.putmail.smtp.auth, true         prop.putmail.smtp.starttls.enable, true           Session session  Session.getDefaultInstanceprop, new Authenticator                Override method to Authenticate to mail server             Override             protected PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication              return new PasswordAuthenticationMCA28admin, pass                                    session.setDebugtrue          MimeMessage Msg  new MimeMessagesession         System.out.printlnPlease enter the From         String setFrom  console.nextLine         Msg.setFromnew InternetAddressFrom         System.out.printlnPlease enter which email to send to         String setTo  console.nextLine         Msg.setRecipientsRecipientType.TO, To         System.out.printlnSet the Subject         String subject  console.nextLine         Msg.setSubjectSubject         System.out.printlnSet the message Body         String MessageBody  console.nextLine          Initiate MimeBodyPart for filling email content         MimeBodyPart messagePart  new MimeBodyPart         messagePart.setTextBody         Multipart multipart  new MimeMultipart         multipart.addBodyPartmessagePart         Msg.setContentmultipart           Email Sending process         Transport.sendMsg           public static String getPageCodeURL SQL throws IOException  Gets URL, returns InputLine              URLConnection openLine  SQL.openConnection         BufferedReader in  null         String inputLine  null         String line         in  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReaderopenLine.getInputStream          whileline  in.readLine  null                      inputLine  line                   return inputLine          codepre

Negative 16611 pGiven the availability of a new workstation Intell Xeon X5690, Windows 7 Professional, 64bit for numerical analysis of fluid dynamics models, I find it a shame not engage in parallel computing. So far, I have had no or little experience in this field.p  pWhats the difference between MSMPI and the latest release of MPICH suitable for Windows I installed a hrefhttpwww.mpich.orgstaticdownloads1.4.1p1 relnofollowMPICH 1.4.1a, but I cannot get a a hrefhttpwww.physics.sdsu.edujohnsonphys580Parallelcomputing1.pdf relnofollowtest programa to work on codeIfortcode.

Negative 16611 pIve always had the same problem, and Id really like to know if theres a solution to it. If I do something likep  precodefigure axis[2 2 2 2] a1 hrectanglePosition,[1,0,0.1,0.1] t0 while a1 if ishandleh tt0.1 pause0.001 x0.2cost y0.2sint seth, Position, [x, y,0.1,0.1] else break end end codepre  pI always get some sort of error when the figure is exited with the x buttonp  precodeError using handle.handleset Invalid or deleted object. codepre  pThis isnt surprising, because if I exit while its reading the loop, it still has to go through it before it realizes that it should be breaking. One way to solve the errors is to add an if ishandleh everywhere I use something used outside of the loop. However, not only is this going to spam my code with ifends at almost every line, it is also extremely slow to exit the code. This is the bigger issue, I dont mind the error that much, or spamming my code, but every time I exit I need to wait an extra 5 seconds where Matlab freezes for some reason. p  pIs that normal Is there a more efficient way to close a figure Im thinking there has to be a listener for when the x button is clicked on a figure, that would just stop everything...p  pThis is very frustrating and driving me mad, any help would be appreciated.p  pThank you,p  pMikep
Negative 16611 pAs the title implies.  Deleting the first node in the linked list works like a charm.  Its those other dang nodes  Ok, so here is my code.  I think I am deleting properly, but I am not linking correctly. p  pHere is what the structs and typedefs look like p  precodetypedef struct List ListP typedef struct Entry EntryP typedef char ListItemP  struct List      int sizeL     struct Entry head   struct Entry      ListItemP content     struct Entry next     int sizeL  codepre  pThe way that the removeItemList function works in main.c is is by passing a list pointer ListP thisList and a string ListItemP thisItem.  Once the parameters have been passed, the function searches for the same string as a node in the list via strcmp and when it finds it removes it.  NewEntry initialized Entry struct and has an input that passes a character to newEntrycontent.  Anyways, here is the function p  precodevoid removeItemListListP thisList, ListItemP thisItem      EntryP temp  newEntry0x00     EntryP temp2  newEntry0x00      tempgtnext  thisListgthead     temp2gtnext  thisListgthead     if strcmptempgtnextgtcontent, thisItem  0              thisListgthead  tempgtnextgtnext          else           whiletempgtnext  0x00                       ifstrcmptempgtnextgtcontent,thisItem  0                  break                          tempgtnext  tempgtnextgtnext             tempgtsizeL                   if tempgtnext  0x00                   else              int i  0             fori  0 i lt tempgtsizeL  1  i                              temp2gtnext  temp2gtnextgtnext                 printfs n, temp2gtcontent                          temp2gtnext  tempgtnextgtnext             freetemp2gtnext                   thisListgtsizeL  codepre  pI think that the node before the node being removed winds up being pointed to null.

Negative 16611 pIm entering an if statement and deleting a dynamically allocated node in a linked list, then reallocating it.

Once I leave, it becomes a null pointer. This also happens when I remove codereturncode and instead move on to the codeelsecode section.

It emseemedem to not run the codeinitcode function but my assertion fails because the result ends up being a mock instance as opposed to my value.p  pI also tried to configure a codepatchcode instance in the codesetUpcode function, using the codestartcode and codestopcode functions as a hrefhttpwww.voidspace.org.ukpythonmockpatch.htmlpatchmethodsstartandstop relnofollowthe docs suggesta.p  precodeclass TestCaseWithSetUpunittest.TestCase      def setUpself         self.mockClass  mock.MagicMock         self.mockClass.getvalue.returnvalue  test value         patcher  mock.patchmypackage.ClassWithComplexInit, self.mockClass         patcher.start         self.addCleanuppatcher.stop      def testmyfuncself         sut  SystemUnderTest         result  sut.myfunc   seems to not execute ClassWithComplexInit.init         self.assertEqualtest value, result   still fails          AssertionError test value  ltMagicMock namemock.getvalue id4554658128gt codepre  pThis also seems to avoid my codeinitcode function but the value I set for codegetvalue.returnvaluecode isnt being respected and codegetvaluecode is still returning a codeMagicMockcode instance.p  pHow can I mock a class with an complicated codeinitcode which is instantiated by my code under test Ideally, I would like a solution which works well for many unit tests within a TestCase class e.g. Not needing to codepatchcode every test.p  pI am using Python version code2.7.6code.p

You can almost fix this withp  precoderecords  Foo.selectfoos..joinsbar  baz qux .mergeQux.withroleadmin codepre  pBut this is deceptive as it will take values from columns not on codequxxescode from codefooscode but the columns that have the same names, for example codeidcode, codecreatedatcode, and codeupdatedatcode in a typical rails app will come from codequxxescode.p

Negative 16611 pIve got an Arduino Uno which Id like to setup to with a TTL Serial JPEG Camera for image capture and send that data using a GPRS shield.p  pCurrently Ive got the two pieces of hardware working independently.

The a hrefhttpwww.seeedstudio.comwikiGPRSShieldV2.0 relnofollowGPRS shielda is sending SMS, and connecting to web urls.p  pNow that Ive confirmed both work in isolation, how do I combine the code  The baud rate for the GPRS is set at 19200 and the camera at 9600.  Ive tried to set the baud of the GPRS shield down to 9600 and while it runs I dont get any response from the text message I tried to send.  Also the camera documentation says a hrefhttpslearn.adafruit.comttlserialcamerafaq relnofollownot to change the baud ratea. Any guidance is appreciatedp

Negative 16611 pIve recently run into a following problem with using wsimport as a maven plugin.p  pIts ok, if you use it in order to generate java classes from a wsdl, if you address it like URL. In that case the main file contains this code in the initialisation sectionp  precodeurl  new URLhttpmyserver.comMyService.asmxwsdl codepre  pThats ok. However, lets assume that I have a local wsdl inside my project, and I want to use wsimport in order to generate the classes. In that case the main class will have something like thisp  precodeurl  new URLfilehomeuserprojectresourceswsdlMyService.wsdl codepre  pIn other words, this will work if you run that on my machine, but this program will fail to launch at any other machine. So my question consists of two partsp  ul liIs there a way to specify wsimport, that although the file is local, the generated code should in fact address some actual urlli liWhy does wsimport try to parse the wsdl again after generating the classes I mean, it does store in  those classes information about the methods, so why cannot it use some annotations in order to specify the actual address of the method, that is written as a binding inside the wsdl itselfli ul

Negative 16611 pI have a batch script that supplies a username and password to a Windows Service that are required for that service to start. However I am running into breaking issues trying to supply a password that has special characters that are operators in Windows Batch.p  pThe password I am using has special characters and cannot be easily changed to remove them. In this case the special characters  Batch operators that are used are codecode and codegtcode. Lets say the password is codemygtpasswordcode. The password is stored in a separate batch file that stores it as codemygtpasswordcode with quotes in order to prevent the operators from being interpreted as such.p  pThe password is supplied to an external service asp  pcodeMYDIRECTORYMyService.exe service MYUSER MYPWDcodep  pHeres where I run into trouble. codeMYPWDcode by default, includes the quotation marks as part of the string. So when I supply it as is, codemygtpasswordcode is supplied to the service, which is incorrect, causing it to fail.p  pWhen I strip the quotes so that I have codemygtpasswordcode, the correct password, the codegtcode and codecode operators are run, and cause a breaking error when the batch script is executed.p  pFinally, when I escape the operators, such that codemygtpasswordcode becomes codemygtpasswordcode the script does emnotem fail, but the password supplied to the service INCLUDES the escape characters, which is again wrong, causing the service to fail.p  pIs there any solution by which I can supply a password or really any variable that contains special characters without the escape characters or quotes being passed along with itp  pEDIT Thanks to the below answer, I managed to solve this with a slight addition that I wanted to note. Due to the variable being assigned in an external shared file, I could not change p  pcodeset MYPWDmygtpasswordcode to codeset MYPWDmygtpasswordcodep  pSo I had to deal with scrubbing the quotes. My code ended up looking like p  precodesetlocal enabledelayedexpansion  set MYPWDMYPWD  echo Passing Credentials MyService.exe service MYUSER MYPWD endlocal codepre

Negative 16611 pIm developing a C class library for timeseries modeling. Ive run into some namingterminology issues.  I am unsure whether I should name one of my template collection classes class serieslt or class sequencelt. p  pMathematically speaking a series is the sum of a sequence, but when we speak of a time series there is no sum involved I am wondering which part of the time series is actually the series if any.p  pMore specifically, imagine two columns in a table. One holds the timepoints and the second the corresponding values. The C class I need to name holds the data from either of these columns. The class is however not used in the context of a table but rather a model or strategy. p  pMy question is Am I technically wrong naming the class series Should it be named sequence instead p

Negative 16611 pI use docker in both development and production and one thing which really bugs me is docker cache simplicity. I have ruby application which requires codebundle installcode to install dependencies so I start with the following Dockerfile code ADD Gemfile Gemfile ADD Gemfile.lock Gemfile.lock RUN bundle install path rootbundle code All dependencies are cached and it works great until I add a new gem. Even if gem I have added is just 0.5 MB it still takes 1015 minutes to install all application gems from scratch. And then another 10 minutes to deploy it due to the size of dependencies folder  about 300MB. p  pI have encountered exactly the same problem with nodemodules and npm. I was wondering, did anyone found solution for this problemp  pMy research results so farp  ul lipa hrefhttpsgithub.comopenshiftsourcetoimage relnofollowSource to imagea  caches arbitrary files across incremental builds. Unfortunately, due to the way it works it requires to push the whole 300MB to a registry even when gems are not changed. Faster build  slower deploy even when gems are not updated.pli lipa hrefhttpsgithub.comcpuguy83dockerrailsdevdemoblobmasterDockerfileL17 relnofollowGemfile.tipa  split Gemfile into two different files and only add gems to one of them. Very specific solution to bundler and I am not convinced that it is gonna scale beyond adding 12 gems. pli lipa hrefhttpharpoon.readthedocs.orgenlatestdocsrecursivecontainers.html relnofollowHarpoona  would be a good fit if not the fact that they force ditching of Dockerfile and switch to they own format. Which means extra pain for all new devs in a team as this toolset requires time to learn separately from docker.pli lipTemporarily package cache. That is just an idea I had not sure is it possible. Somehow bring package manager cache  not the dependencies folder  to the machine before installing packages and then remove it.

Using MVS 2013.p  pFilename.cppp  precodeinclude Functions.h int main      introInformation     introInformation2  codepre  pFunctions.cpp  p  precodevoid introInformation  A bunch of couts telling the user how to play the game.   void introInformation2  A bunch of couts telling the user how to play the game.    codepre  pWhen introInformation2 is called in main. MVS gives the error introInformation2 identifier not found. But why only the second Everything appears to be identical.p  pStranger yet, when I make a function declaration above main for just introInformation2 everything works fine. But at the same time there is no declaration for introInformation.p  pIve noticed that if I change the name of introInformation to introInformation1 yes, in the function call and the definition I get the same error. It seems like MVS is set on the previous name.p  pIve got a slight suspicion that this is happening because I copypasted this original project and worked on possible changes without changing the pasted projects folder name. That new project has since been deleted.p

Negative 16611 pMy mobile application works with the aid of a backend server that processes all of the logic for the users, allowing them to communicate and interact with each other. However sometimes when making updates or changes to an application the backend or format of data may be changed. Possibly because of a logical error bug or for security reasons. p  pCurrently Im trying to figure out the best way to handle this before release of my application to the apple and android store. Whenever an update occurs to the application that requires the server to respond differently, I need to make sure all devices are updated to the proper version, if not there will be errors and some functions of the application may not work or yield unwanted results.p  pOne way to battle this would be to program with the idea of reverse compatibility in mind at all times, however sometimes when doing large updates or even ravamps of systems this may not be possible, some information may not be used, or additional information may be requires. The format of information may change, etc, etc. p  pSo this brings me to forcing an update for applications. Requiring that the application be brought up to the current version at all times before it can be used.p  pIm currently using the IonicCordova platform for hybrid development and Im wondering the best approach to take for this. Should I store the application and client version on the server and just have it run a check every so often Is there a way to check the appleandroid store to see if there is an update available for the application and then download it p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 16611 pIm programatically dragging the play head back and forth along a timeline based on a mouse event listener. The faster the mouse drags the faster the playhead rips through the frames its linearly proportional. p  pIm also firing a startergetTimer event at the inital mousemove Event trigger and only on the initial event and then firing a endergetTimer at the end of the code that calculates the new playhead position, but only if the calculation has resulted in the playhead being told to move at least one frame the mouse can move a few pixels before playhead will move one frame. In essence its giving me a frame per second rate.p  pIf I look a the delta of the two timers I rarely get anything but 0. Occasionally Ill get a 1 but not very often. There are a good few dozen heavy lines of code that need to be worked out between the initial mousemove and the decision to move the play head, and this has to be done for a number of mouse position changes before the playhead will move at all and the second getTimer call is triggered. Does the mouseEvent trigger every ms or does it trigger at the frame rate enterframe rate of the doc. If so the smallest delta I should see is 31ms.p  pThis runs as an app in the standalone swf player 10.1 and never in a browser. Are my results indicative of this Can the compiler really run this fast How does one do very small timing tests that appear to be beyond the millisecond clock granularity p  pHave I missed something obviousp

Negative 16611 pI am a big fan of NTiers for my development choices, of course it doesnt fit every scenario.p  pI am currently working on a new project and I am trying to have a play with the way I normally work, and trying to see if I can clean it up. As I have been a very bad boy and have been putting too much code in the presentation layer.p  pMy normal business layer structure is this basic view of itp  ul liBusiness ul liServices ul liFooComponent ul liFooHelpersli liFooWorkflows  li ulli liBahComponent ul liBahHelpersli liBahWorkflows  li ulli ulli liUtilities ul liCommonli liExceptionHandlersli liImportersli lietc...li ulli ulli ul  pNow with the above I have great access to directly save a Foo object and a Bah object, via their respective helpers.p  pThe XXXHelpers give me access to Save, Edit and Load the respective objects, but where do I put the logic to save objects with child objects.p  pFor examplep  pWe have the below objects not very good objects I knowp  ul liEmployeeli liEmployeeDetailsli liEmployeeMembershipli liEmployeeProfileli ul  pCurrently I would build these all up in the presentation layer and then pass them to their Helpers, I feel this is wrong, I think the data should be passed to a single point above presentation in the business layer some place and sorted out there.p  pBut Im at a bit of a loss as to where I would put this logic and what to call the sector, would it go under Utilities as EmployeeManager or something like thisp  pWhat would you do and I know this is all preference.p  h1A more detailed layouth1  pThe workflows contain all the calls directly to the DataRepository for examplep  precodepublic ObjectNameGetByIdGuid id      return DataRepository.ObjectNameProvider.GetByIdid  codepre  pAnd then the helpers provider access to the workflowsp  precodepublic ObjectName GetByIdGuid id      return loadWorkflow.GetByIdid  codepre  pThis is to cut down on duplicate code, as you can have one call in the workflow to getBySomeProperty and then several calls in the Helper which could do other operations and return the data in different ways, a bad example would be public GetByIdAsc and GetByIdDescp  pBy seperating the calls to the Data Model by using the DataRepository, it means that it would be possible to swap out the model for another instance that was the thinking but ProviderHelper has not been broken down so it is not interchangable, as it is hardcode to EF unfortunately. I dont intend to change the access technology, but in the future there might be something better or just something that all the cool kids are now using that I might want to implement instead.p  h1projectName.Coreh1  precodeprojectName.Business      Interfaces          IDeleteWorkflows.cs          ILoadWorkflows.cs          ISaveWorkflows.cs          IServiceHelper.cs          IServiceViewHelper.cs      Services          ObjectNameComponent              Helpers                  ObjectNameHelper.cs              Workflows                  DeleteObjectNameWorkflow.cs                  LoadObjectNameWorkflow.cs                  SaveObjectNameWorkflow.cs      Utilities          Common              SettingsManager.cs              JavascriptManager.cs              XmlHelper.cs              others...

Then question is, where should I keep parsed JSON objectp  pi I cant save JSON object to preferences since only primitive data can be stored there.p  pii Should I do parsing every time my app starts, and make my parsed JSON objects I have more of them global on application level so I can access them from all of my activitiesp  piii Or, I believe my 3rd option would be to declare JSON objests static so they can be easy accessed from other activitiesp  pWhat is the best way to do thisp  pTHX.p
Negative 16611 pFor a project Im working on, I need to render text of varying fontsize on a canvas, sometimes several times.

Negative 16611 pI know its not possible to isntall a clickonce application for all users, due to a limitation with the technology and what its purpose is. My problem is this...I have a Windows Forms application Ive build, and deployed using ClickOnce. It uses user settings, 2 to be exact to store some information that the application needs.p  pNow I can install the application fine and it works...But if I login as another user, it looses its settings. Is there a way to have the settings global to the application, so that if I install it for a second, or third user, it doesnt remove settings in place, when it was installed for the first userp  pNot sure if changing my settings from User to Application, would fix this or not. Any advice is appreciated.p

Negative 16611 pLet me first start with explaining the situation. I am making a IOS app that is working with a webservice and a webApplication. Take the following example.p  pLets say we have company X. company X can make all kinds of forms with the webapplication Callback form, meetingRequest form, vacationRequestForm,... Employers will then open their application and see all the titles of these forms in a tableview. When they click on a title they go to the next screen and see the entire form and can start filling it up.p  pThe difficulty here is that each company can create their own forms. So company X maybe have other kinds of forms than company Y. After a lot of research I found the amazing library of QuickDialog. You can find it over a hrefhttpescoz.comopensourcequickdialog relnofollowherea. Definitely worth it to check it outp  pstrongPROBLEMstrong Okay now the problem. Offcourse the data should be send back to the server once a user filled up the form. To do that I am working with a controller class and a NSObject class. The best way to understand is look at the login example. First of all, this is the json of the login.p  precode     grouped true,     title Login Form,     controllerName LoginController,     sections [          titlelogin, elements [                  typeQEntryElement, titleLogin,placeholderLogin or email, bindtextValuelogin, keylogin,                   typeQEntryElement, titlePassword, placeholderPassword,  secureTextEntrytrue, bindtextValuepassword              ]         ,          elements[                  typeQButtonElement, keybutton, titleLogin, controllerActiononLogin             ]              ]  codepre  pYou can see that the two fields have a binding option. The project contains a NSObject class loginInfo In this class those fields are added as NSStrings.p  precodeinterface LoginInfo  NSObject  private     NSString password     NSString login   propertystrong NSString login propertystrong NSString password end codepre  pNext there is a controller class. In this controller class you say that when the button is pushed you fetch the values from the textfields into this loginInfo class. This is done at the following way.p  precode voidonLoginQButtonElement buttonElement       [[[UIApplication sharedApplication] keyWindow] endEditingYES]     [self loadingYES]     LoginInfo info  [[LoginInfo alloc] init]     [self.root fetchValueUsingBindingsIntoObjectinfo]     [self performSelectorselectorloginCompleted withObjectinfo afterDelay2]   voidloginCompletedLoginInfo info      [self loadingNO]     UIAlertView alert  [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitleWelcome message[NSString stringWithFormat Hi , I hope youre loving QuickDialog Heres your pass , info.login, info.password] delegateself cancelButtonTitleYES otherButtonTitlesnil]     [alert show]  codepre  pOkay I know this is alot of info. But I only want a good explanation of my problem. I think the controller class is not my problem but the NSObject class is. I want this to be generic. Because this should be filled up with the properties it gets back from the json. I dont know how I can do that.p  pI hope anybody can help me If you need more explanation feel free to askp  pKind regards and many thanks in advance p

I need a code that grabs every column and every row...looks at the first value of the first type of info in this case, Vendor ID, and then creates as many new sheets in this same document as it needs to to create one for every single different vendor ID.p  pAny help would be much appreciated. Im trying to not have to do this by hand as much as possible.p

Negative 16611 pThis past Monday we pushed out a new ASP.NET website to our production server for use by the public. One section of the site provides a wizard type interface, each step requesting a fairly small amount of input from the user. Each step of the wizard is its own user control. As the user moves through the steps, their input is saved to the viewstate, the current control is hidden, and the next is made visible. They of course can go back if need be.p  pOverall, everything is running smooth given the amount of use were seeing, but we have had two users call in to say that as they tried to move from one step to the next, they were given the message Request Entity Too Large. I gathered all of their input, and  went through myself trying to recreate the problem.p  pIn both cases I went through several times, and everything worked without issue. During another test run, I got a phone call, and was sidetracked for about 5 minutes. When I went to pick up where I left off, I then got the same error. I then tried again, purposely waiting for a few minutes at one step in the process, and got the error again. This was a different step then where I had paused the last time.p  pIm wondering if inactivity can actually contribute to the problem, and if increasing the uploadReadAheadSize value in IIS is the correct solution, or if we can somehow correct the problem in the application itself. Thanks.p

Negative 16611 pThere are a couple of classes which are meant to be derived by other classes pretty often. They are user input receivers, like a key down receiver, a key release receiver, mouse move receiver and so on. Classes that inherit from those are for example the hotkeyaction, which inherits from key down receiver and key release receiver, or a camerarotator, which inherits from mouse move receiver. The input a user does will be forwarded by another class to the corresponding receivers, thus any input receiver, e.g. the camerarotator, needs to register itself in that forwarding class. The class that forwards the inputs is always the same, there are never two.p  pWhen users of my class create a new input receiver, a class that inherits from e.g. the mouse move receiver, the mouse move receiver needs to know the forwarding class in order to register itself for receiving mouse inputs. So the code of the mouse move receiver constructor looks like thisp  precodemouseMoveReceiverIFinputforwarder ifo      ifo.registerInputReceiverthis  codepre  pSince its clear that there is only one inputforwarder, its not only less intuitive if the user has to pass it, but also its additional typing for each inputreceiver created.p  pBut if id make the inputforwarder a singleton or a global variable, so that the input receivers can access it without the need for the user to pass it in the constructor, id have other problems Then the user needed to know that the inputforwarder has to exist before any inputforwarder is created. Nothing would warn him, nothing would force him to create the inputforwarder first. The program would simply crash, because the input receiver would try to register with an inexistant input forwarder. And that would be even worse.p  pHow does an effective and proper way look like What are alternatives to the above mentioned examplesp  pThanksp

Negative 16611 pIn my app i am getting a list of rss feeds and displaying them in a listview. Onclick of a list item i am starting a new activity. p  pFor 8 out of total 10 list items this works as expected. But upon clicking any one of remaining 2 items the app crashes immediately with stack corruption detected aborted log message. Nothing else is printed in logs. p  pHowever this behavior is only seen on my HTC one V device. I have tested the app on Samsung galaxy note amp samsung galaxy Y duos. The app is working correctly. p  pI have searched for this error and almost everywhere i have found the cause of this behavior to be some native coding in c or c.

Negative 16611 pI copied the PEM file into usrlocalsharecacertificates and ran updatecacertificates, and I verified that the resulting certificate is now included in etcsslcertscacertificates.crt which is the file printed by curlconfig ca.  I also verified that the certificate printed by openssl sclient connect example.com443 was identical to my PEM file.  And yet I continue to get the error14090086SSL routinesSSL3GETSERVERCERTIFICATEcertificate verify failed message.  This happens even if I use curls cacert option as described at a hrefhttpcurl.haxx.sedocssslcerts.htmlhttpcurl.haxx.sedocssslcerts.htmla to tell it what certificate to use.p  pIt works if I disable certificate verification altogether with curl k, but I dont want to do that because Im trying to write a test harness thats supposed to test the SSL properly.p  pIt works fine if I access the same URL in lynx, which normally complains if there are any SSL errors.  But I cant just use Lynx for this test harness, unless I can find some way of making Tornados AsyncHTTPClient use Lynx instead of libcurl.  And it doesnt seem to make any sense that installing the selfsigned certificate satisfies Lynx but not curl.p  pIm using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS in a Vagrantpowered VirtualBox it has curl 7.22.0.

Negative 16611 pMy hardware specs are listed below, though this is probably not importantp  pI use my machine for data processing, which often involves holding large amounts of data in memory I have made many improvements in my code lately by reading in partial files to decrease memory use, but this remains problematic, with all of my analysis being done in Python 2.7 numpyscipy and pandas.  When RAM usage  100 the computer performance becomes expectedly sluggish.  What I dont understand is why it remains sluggish e.g. it takes 20s to open a 4kb file after my code finishes running, memory usage has dropped to 1050, and the CPU sits just above idle.  I have even forced all Python processes to close in task manager, which does not help.  Furthermore, the sluggishness persists until reboot.p  pFrom my hardware status stats I would expect better performance, so I suspect there is something going on behind the scenes.  Since this only happens after I push memory usage to 100 which only happens when I am processing data in Python I wonder if Python is doing something behind the scenes that I am not aware of honestly, I cannot image what this would be, but I am truly stumped.  Since I only see this in Python I give it a python tag though I think this is not a python issue.p  pAny insight will be appreciated.

Negative 16611 pIm looking for a way, in Cowboy, to map arbitrary paths stored in the database to specific blog posts.p  pThat is Ive got a few thousand blog posts, which are accessible via a few names each, such as the canonical URL e.g. codepost42code, some aliases e.g. code20131125erlangrockscode, historical locations e.g. codepathonoldblog12345code, etc.p  pI know that I could simply use a catchall routep  precode [...], catchallhandler, [] , codepre  p...and then look up the path in the database, but I was considering creating the routes from the database, as followsp  precodePosts  postsall, Paths  [gethandlersforpostP  P lt Posts], Routes  listsflattenPaths,  gethandlerforpostP gt      Generate a list of paths with IDs from the database.

Negative 16611 pI have made a C program with some classes having some methods which I want to make scriptable with Python3. At runtime, the program loads some Python scripts from somewhere and executes it. The scripts shall be able to call some of my C methods in order to control program behaviour. Probably, this is a common plugin scenario.p  pWhat Ive done so far is to embed Pythons CAPI and to handcraft some codePyMethodDefcode and codePyModuleDefcode stuff. I was also able to get complete class wrappers by creating codePyTypeObjectcode instances.p  pUnfortunately, it does not seem feasible to me to proceed this way. I need to implement a mechanism, which allows me to specify my api somewhere and have it automatically available in the Python world. This is very much one part of what Boost.Python offers. The idea to just use this library and be lucky is probably a very reasonable one.p  pHowever, I began to try to implement it on my own because I dont love external dependencies and primarily because I am interesting in learning.p  pMy successes so far unfortunately are not worth mentioning, since every idea seem to run in a dead end p  pThe codePyMethodDefcode structure needs to be filled with something like a codePyObject PyObject,PyObjectcode function pointer. So I seem to have to provide one plain function not even a method of some advantageously templated class for each of my C methods, which translates between the codePyObjectcodes and native C values and executes the C method on a certain instance.p  pMy first idea was to write a template class, which somehow gets my native method as template argument. In the first run, I restricted the implementation to only one certain method signature, lets say only codevoidintcode. My hope was to see how I can make it more flexible later on. But even with this restriction, I was unable to pass something useful to the codePyTypeObjectcode. My template class of course can have some instances, but then I only have a method but nothing I can put in the function pointer there. A static method circumvents polymorphism, so this also does not seem to be the solution.p  pCan anybody explain what is the very basic approach of Boost.Python achieving this goal Neither reading the code nor the manual gave an idea so far, since it actually does far far more than what I want. I would restrict my api to just use bool, int, some string representation and pointers to other api objects as parameters and return values. I do not need most of the additional magic like translation of exceptions and so on. I want to get a KISS solution.p  pOtherwise, can anybody give a hint like ...p  ul lihow to design my template class in order to make it match, orli lihow to achieve more flexibility than just having codevoidintcode methods in the api in a smart but simple way, orli lihow to solve the problem in a probably completely different way avoiding to become trapped into the XY problem li ul  pp  pOne further design goal is worth mentioning If even possible, I want to decouple my api specification from Pythonspecific stuff. In theory, it should be possible to also embed a JavaScriptorwhatever interpreter on top of the same api specification without having to touch it.p  pMore and more I suspect that some parts of my goals are hardly reachable, but I hope somebody here can at least give some new direction of thought.p

Negative 16611 pI have a collection that Im listening to all model change events on. In one specific model property, I need to set an additional value on the model, which causes the event to be fired again. Im trying to pass in custom options so I can ignore the second call. I dont want to use code silent true code because I need the UI to update still.p  pThe problem is my custom options are making it through. I have found the reason is because the change event is being fired within the change event on the current model, so it just continues it in the backbone code, and my custom options arent being passed in.p  pThis is what Im doing. This is rough code for example purposes and not exact.p  precodevar View  Backbone.View.extend     initialize function         this.collection  new Backbone.Collection         this.listenTothis.collection, change, this.modelChange     ,      modelChange functionmodel, options              if.hasmodel.changed, IsSelected             model.set Selected true ,  modelChanging true                     Do some other things...       codepre  pWhats happening here is that I need to subscribe to any change event that happens and do something when it does. There are 10 properties so I dont want to list them all. If the property that changed isnt codeIsSelectedcode, the I need to set it to codetruecode. This will cause the codechangecode event to fire again, and the codemodelChangecode method will be called again. This is where Im expecting my code modelChanging true code option to be available, but it isnt. Ive found that this is happening because its setting the value of the model during a change event, so backbone will fire the event itself, and backbone doesnt know about my options that I passed in.p  pThis is one solution Ive come up with, but I really dont like it.p  precodesetTimeoutfunction     model.set Selected true ,  modelChanging true  , 0 codepre  pThis will run it asynchronously so it will no longer be a part of the same event. I really dont like this and it feels like a major hack. p  pHow can I accomplish this without a codesetTimeoutcodep

However, I encountered a little problem, I am unable to find a mechanism in .NET to support replacing code at runtime, and be able to dispose of the old code, loaded previously. This means replacing a moduleobject dynamically and almost instantly displaying the changes to the user, for example, when he restarts a procedure, but not the whole program.p  pI have already taken into account the possibility of having separate codeAppDomaincode for each session and loading the necessary assemblies into it but this seems a little bit too expensive. I should also mention that every session benefits from a common base of assemblies, for instance, to connect to a database, so this means loading those classes into every single session. Marshalling data back and forth from the separate codeAppDomaincode also represents an additional overhead could be used when data is sent to the client application through the network, code for this contained in the main codeAppDomaincode, which manages the sessions.p  pIs there a framework or way of replacingunloading particular parts of code How is it done in realworld applications Can there be a workaround Or have I picked the wrong set of toolsp
Negative 16611 pIm reading a CSV file a few times a day. Its about 300MB and each time I have to read it through, compare with existing data in the database, add new ones, hide old ones and update existing ones. There are also bunch of data thats not getting touch. p  pI have access to all files both old and new ones and Id like to compare new one with the previous one and just update whats changed in the file. I have no idea what to do and Im using C to do all my work. The one thing that might be most problematic is that a row in the previous field might be in another location in the second feed even if its not updated at all. I want to avoid that problem as well, if possible.p  pAny idea would help.p

Negative 16611 pI wanted to know what algorithms I could use for NLUp  pFor example, lets say I want to start a program, and I have these sentencesp  blockquote   pLet us startp      pLet him startp blockquote  pObviously, the first sentence should start the program, but not the second one since it doesnt make sense.p  pRight now, I have am using Stanfords NLP API and have implemented the TokenRegexAnnotator classp  precodeCoreMapExpressionExtractorltMatchedExpressiongt extractor  CoreMapExpressionExtractor.createExtractorFromFileenv, tr.txt codepre  pSo my code knows what Start should do, that is, Start should triggerstart the program. But Start could be used with anything, like Start the car. In this case, I wouldnt want to Start the program because the sentence is about starting a car, not the program. To solve this, I used Stanfords CollapsedDependenciesAnnotation class p  precodeSemanticGraph dependencies  s.getCollapsedDependenciesAnnotation.class IterableltSemanticGraphEdgegt edgeset  dependencies.edgeIterable codepre  pI used the codensubjcode dependency to see if the subject was a codePRPcode pronoun since I want the program to start only when the subject is a codePRPcode. So when I inputed the sentence let us start in my program, the program started. However, when I inputed the sentence Start the car, the program didnt start. All is working well...p  pBUT the program will also start when I input the sentence Let him start as mentioned above. It starts because him is also a pronoun. I do not want the program to start when I input this sentence because Let him start has nothing to do with the starting the program. So how will the program know this What can I do to solve this problem Are there algorithms that will let the computer differentiate between let us start and let him startp  pAny ideas on how to solve this problemp  pThank youp  pI hope I am being clearp

We store the current cursor location as we go along for the next time the service runs. p  pThe customer feels that its possible, but very rare, that data might be missed for certain days and they want to be able to manually go back to a previous 24 hour period and collect the data again. They want a GUI with a DatePicker and a Run button. they want to be able to get records that might be weeks old.p  pMy question is How do I obtain a row number to set the cursor position to in C Sql,or NHibernate, or EF for a specific record based on a DateTime valuep  pI know that BizTalk might perform this automated service better, but the customer wants special operations done with the data If you know of a good way to do this in BizTalk, please advise theres a possibility we can switch.p  pI am uncertain if this is possible.p  pThank you for your help and kind regards.p

Negative 16611 pSo I have started looking into NFC recently, and have a smal project that Im working on. However, during my research I came across the terms NFC frontend solutions and NFC controller solutions.p  pI have to admit, I really cannot tell what the difference is. Is it just two words for the same thing And if not, in what way are they different It was on the NXP website that i first came across the term.p  pEdit So I have done more reading, and I think the frontend solution refers to frontend vs backend system concept. I should have guessed this, but it threw me off that I could find no mention of an NFC backend solution and therefor I thought it was something else entirely.p  pThe same with controller really. Im now reading up on these concepts, since its been a while since I last heard of or read anything about these things.p

Negative 16611 pI have spherical coordinates that I derived from cartesian coordinates in a 3D space. Due to the method of acquisition these points should all lie on the same sphere. Im trying to map the coordinates to an image in a browser window, but I am encountering 2 primary issuesp  ol liSpherical coordinates can be negative and browser mouse location coordinates are positive with the origin in the top left corner.li liSpherical coordinate components are so small as to be indistinguishably placed in a cluster in the top left corner.li ol  pTo solve these, I am shifting all point acquired up the amount of the lowest negative value. This should ensure that all points appear on the browser grid.
