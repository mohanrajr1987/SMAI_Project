Negative 6051 pI have an iPhone app that is running great in the simulator.  It responds well to the memory warnings by getting rid of everything that is not absolutely essential.  When I run it on the device, it runs well.  But after a certain amount of usage it crashes with error code 101  which, from what I can tell, is the OS killing it due to memory usage.  I can see the memory warning Im logging it, and my app responds to it, but dies shortly thereafter. p  pIf I look at the app in Instruments either on the device or in sim, it doesnt find any leaks.  In addition, the net memory usage is in the range of 600700k bytes.  Transitioning from the different views of my app increases memory usage as expected, but when the views and controllers are released and deallocd, the memory usage never quite goes as low as it was.  However, the addition is usually only something in the range of 10002000 bytes.  So while Leaks shows me no leaks, I suspect there is an issue somewhere.  Ive also looked at all of the objects Im allocating, and all of them seem to be reclaimed as expected.  The only objects I see that keep increasing are GeneralBlockN where N is some numberp  pShould I not pay any attention to Instruments net usage figure  What would be the next steps in trying to diagnose the issue  p  pADDED Im not making any calls to malloc or any CoreFoundation libraries that would return a buffer that Im responsible for.

Negative 6051 pIve been working on making my app easier to use for administrators. One of the things Id really like to do is allow admins to modify other users settings from within the program  while still making it possible for regular ol users to modify their own settings, as my application isnt necessarily only for administrators who want to force users to use specific settings.p  pI thought of two possible ways of doing thisp  blockquoteb1b Move the user setting file path from where it is now CLSIDAPPDATA, commonly bDocuments and SettingsiUsernameib to a worldaccessible path CLSIDCOMMONAPPDATA , commonly bDocuments and SettingsAll Usersb. Then, save each users settings to a unique file for the user probably having a name which equals that of the users textual SID, so the folder looks something likebrbr     CDocuments and SettingsAll UsersMy CompanyMy Programsettings123abc456def.settingsbr     CDocuments and SettingsAll UsersMy CompanyMy Programsettings234bcd477xyz.settingsbr     CDocuments and SettingsAll UsersMy CompanyMy Programsettings946hdc743ddd.settings brbr bProsbbrbrulliThis allows an admin to see and directly modify any users settings, because the COMMONAPPDATA path is the same for all users. This is how Id really like it to be  its the most straightforward  but theres a major conliul  bConsbbrbrulliPermissions could be a problem. To allow regular users to save their settings, youd have to allow users write access to the programs COMMONAPPDATA setting folder.brbr  Of course, when the settings are saved and the setting file created on disk, youd want to limit write access on the users setting file to the user who the settings are for, and for admins, so that other limited users cant modify them.brbr  However, it could be that before a user has a chance to write their own settings from within the program, a savvy, malicious limited user creates a setting file for that specific user, without the knowledge of the user. If the limited user creates the file, that means they own the file... and then that user who the settings are for cant modify the settings anymore, unless an admin changes the permissions on the file.brbr An unlikely situation perhaps, but it still worries me.liul  b2b Instead of moving the setting file path to a globallyaccessible path and modifying the users setting file directly, have my app create and save an override file in the apps CLSIDCOMMONAPPDATA folder, to allow the admin to override the users settings.brbr  When my app loads for that user whos settings were overridden itll detect this file and load it instead of the regular setting file, which is located in CLSIDAPPDATA bDocuments and SettingsiUsernameib. brbr bProsbbrbrulliPermissions are easy to deal with.brbr  By default, for the bDocuments and SettingsiUsernameib APPDATA folder, only admins and iUsernamei can access the files from within. So that in itself protects the users own regular personal settings from other limited users.brbr  To protect the override settings, my app can simply deny write access to the COMMONAPPDATA folder  where the override file is written  to all but administrators, and then thats that. These overriding settings will only be modifiable by admins.liul  bConsbbrbrulliThis method is obviously more roundabout. If a user modifies his own regular personal settings, an admin wont see those changes  the admin can only see the settings hes overriding the users regular settings with which he can force the user to use instead.brbr  In some ways, this might be good, but... the fact that its roundabout turns me off somewhat.liulblockquote  pIm interested to hear what you guys think about this. Which is my best option Im personally leaning more towards 2, because while its less straightforward, it seems to be more secure and isnt emsoem roundabout where itd be confusing for an admin.p  pHowever, Im also open to suggestions. Is there a superior option you think would work betterp  pbEDIT 7609b I should note that for option 2, the admin could not only override all users settings with a single override file, but also override an individual users settings with an override file specific to that user just like with option 1, that file name would likely be that of the SID of the user whos settings are being overridden. Not sure if that was completely clear in the original post.p

Upon receiving this the background process returns the current status and exists. Now, I need to add the following upon receiving the message it returns a status and triggers a timer that will wait X amount of time on another thread, in the meantime the background process closes all the DB connections and files. If the timer reached 0 then and the background process is still alive then it terminates it. If the background process closed all the db and files then the thread and timer will die before reaching 0 as the application terminates normally.p  pIs this betterp

Negative 6051 pIn a serious Java GUI app, youll have models behind many of your GUI elements A codeDocumentModelcode backing a codeJEditorPanecode, for example, or a codeListModelcode behind a codeJListcode.p  pWere always told not to make GUI changes from outside the Swing worker thread and given codeSwingUtilities.invoke...code for working around that. Fine, I can live with that Its certainly necessary and works well when changing attributes of GUI components directly.p  pIdeally, most of my GUIvisible changes will be to models, not to JComponents, anyway. But because theyre GUIvisible, do they count as GUI changes I.e. do change events and listeners provide the necessary decoupling, or do model changes need to be wrapped in codeinvoke...code as wellp  pProbably old hat to Swing pros, but I wasnt able to find any reference that clearly states one way or another.p

Negative 6051 pI am in the process of creating a small game.  The engine will have a number of events that the GUI can subscribe to.  The events arep  ul liballselectedli liballdeselectedli liballmovedli liballremovedli ul  pThis would all be fine if I only had one type of ball, but there are X number ball types.  They all derive from an abstract Ball class.p  pEach ball type has its own actions that happen when this event happens for them.  They will all need to pass different information back to the GUI.  For example  I have these two ball types there are more just reducing the amount of info here.p  ul liBallBouncingli liBallExplodingli ul  pBallBouncing will need to tell the GUI where it may have moved to, so would just pass back information about it self.p  pBallExploding on the other hand would destroy the surrounding balls from it.  So it would need to say which ball it is and all the balls it has destroyed.p  pthese two balls types could both be fired from the same event, but have different event args.  I could include a dictionary of values but that is not as explicit a having a custom event args for each type.p  pI also thought that if I created a custom event args that had the ball that was involved and then inherited from that for each ball type I could cast the event args back.p  precodepublic abstract class BallBaseEventArgs  EventArgs         public Ball ball   public class BallExplodingEventArgs  BallBaseEventArgs         public IListltBallgt explodedBalls  codepre  pSo in the GUI event handler it would cast the event args by knowing what ball type was used.  I dont like this solution much either as it feels dirty and too tightly tied up.p  pSo I guess I am asking does anyone have suggestions, ideas how to tackle this sort of situation please.p  pThanksp  pJonp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOK, so I thought I would try and explain my structure a little more to clarify and see where it takes usp  pI have an Objects DLL that has the interfaces for the Board and balls, it has two Enums one for the board types and one for the Ball types this is used mainly for the factories to  know which type of object to create.  The DLL also has the various implementations of the Ball class and the Board class.p  pthe abstract Ball class holds information such as the colour, its X and Y coordinates, is selected and BallType Enum.  It has a couple of methods, Clone from ICloneable and CompareTo with the Equals and hash value bits.p  pI have an Instance Manager DLL that has a singleton object that controls the access to the Balls Board and Game Configuration Data.  This DLL also holds the BallFactory and boardFactory not sure if these should have gone in the Objects DLL, reason they are not is because they are not objects so to speak, not sure if this is a great practice.p  pThen I have the Engine DLL.  This deals with all the Logic of the game.  How board and balls are created, why they are created and how they are used.  There is a LogicFactory for the Ball and Board classes all these factories use the BallTypes and BoardTypes Enums to decide which implementation to use.p  pThe Logic Classes decide how the Board moves balls around and calls the balls action methodsp  ul liballselectedli liballdeselectedli liballmovedli liballremovedli ul  pWhich is in the Ball Logic class.  p  pThe reason I didnt put all the logic in the objects them selves is that I thought the logic and functionality should be separate from the objects that just store the data about it, this could be completely wrong.  Most of the functionality about how a Ball could move  act is contained in the BallLogic bass class and each derived class decides on what it calls, all methods are virtual so can be changed as well if needed.p  pThanks for all your input, its really appriacated.  I am doing this for fun but mainly to learn the right and wrong ways to develop different kinds of applications.p

Negative 6051 pI am getting unexpected behavior to me when defining a onetomany relationship with Symfony 1.4.

The YML schema file is as followsp  precodeEmployee   columns     id  type integer, primary true, autoincrement true      firstname  type string30, notnull true      lastname  type string30, notnull true      employerid  type integer    relations     Employer       local employerid       foreign id       type one       foreignType many       foreignAlias Workers  Employer   columns     id  type integer, primary true, autoincrement true      name  type string100      line1  type string100      city  type string100      state  type string10  codepre  pThus, calling codegetWorkerscode on an Employer should return the Employees associated w the Employer. I get this expected behavior when codegetWorkerscode is called the first time.p  pHowever, on subsequent calls, if additional employees have been added to the employer either programmatically or directly in the DB [MySQL], the codegetWorkerscode call still returns the first results.p  pIve verified by stepping through the Symfony source for the codegetWorkerscode call that, on the subsequent calls, its returning the cached value stored in the codereferencescode array.p  pIf I follow the foreign key programmatically, querying codeEmployeecode by codeemployeeidcode, then I get the full result set.p  pCan anyone explain this behaviorp  pHeres some example PHP code that I run in an action, which demonstrates the behaviorp  precode Create common employer. employer  new Employer employergtsetNameMy Employer employergtsetLine1100 Main Street employergtsetCityAnyTown employergtsetStateState employergtsave   Create two employees, worker1  new Employee worker1gtsetFirstNameJohn worker1gtsetLastNameDoe worker1gtsetEmployeremployer worker1gtsave  worker2  new Employee worker2gtsetFirstNameJane worker2gtsetLastNameSmith worker2gtsetEmployeremployer worker2gtsave  myEmployer  DoctrineCoregetTableEmployergtfindOneByname, My Employer workers  myEmployergtgetWorkers echo Number of workers for  . myEmployergtgetName .  is  . countworkers  This gives the expected 2 employees.

Negative 6051 pIm automating some outlook functionality in a .NET app.  It works great.  I am compiling it and using v 12.0.0.0 of the Outlook Interop assembly.  p  pMy code should work on any version of Outlook so it seems silly to have to bind it to a specific version.p  pIs it possible to use reflection to do this instead of compiling a reference  p  pAre the interop assemblies on PCs by default that have Office installed anyway or do I need to include them with my applicationp  pI remember with COM I used to be able to say something like CreateObjectOutlook.Application without needing a strong reference.

It does create an index.jsp but I dont really need a web page interface.p  pI run the servlet from NetBeans pressing f6 and it deploys and opens the servlets index.jsp in my browser. I then run the applet from a different project in Netbeans and try to connect. I still receive the good ol invalid stream header so Im guessing the fault lies within something Ive done in Netbeans.p  pI pasted some code I assume is working old code but havent found any more recent full examples The code is blatantly stolen from a hrefhttpwww.frankbuss.deechoservletindex.html relnofollowLinkap  pSo in the end, what id like do is to send a two dimensional Object array from the servlet to the applet when the applet requests the array to be sent. The code examples is just to show the Invalid stream header Im receiving.p  pI thinkguess the applet is receving a textbased response from the server but I want the response to be a serializedobject Just a String in the code example, it will be an Object[ ][ ] later, if I ever get a clue. p  pThanks for your patience, gurus. p  pApplet code feel free to ignore init with all the layout codep

Negative 6051 pWe are starting the process of internationalizing our software. To do this we will be writing a series of filters to convert all of our different resource files resx, text, java resource, etc into a common format. We will then be outputting xliff files for translation. After translation the process will run in reverse.p  pWe would like to keep the central store updated with any changes that developers make to the resource files ideally using ant during the build process, maintaining knowledge of which branch or version of the software is using which resources. Wed also like to keep track of which version of software the resources were taken from which are sent for translation, the dates when the files were sent and received back and also who translated them.p  pThe idea then being we apply the translations to the correct branch, we can take diffs of the central store in future to send partial resources for translations and we can report on quantity of translation at a point in time.p  pWe are considering storing all of this data within the svn repository as a tree of xliffs, perhaps branched in a mirror of the main code repository. Is this sufficient or would we be better off just using a database to maintain this informationp

Negative 6051 pI am using VS2010 .Net4 LinqtoEntityFramework and would like to explicitly eager load some child data.  I would like to provide functionality similar to that of strongDataLoadOptionsstrong or strongLoadWithstrong which are available for LinqtoSQL IIUC, but are not available to LinqtoEF.p  pAs an aside, this is so that I can record data to be played back later during testing.  We have used lazy loading and I need to find these occurrences and replace with eager loading.  The strongDataLoadOptionsstrong method would allow a clean way to implement this.p  pI am trying to provide a typesafe eager loading scheme as described at a hrefhttpmosesofegypt.netpostIntroducingDataLoadOptionsforEntityFrameworkObjectContext.aspx relnofollowMosesOfEgypt bloga.  I have modified the generation of T4 and have what I think is the last problem.  In .Net4, the entity properties return strongObjectSetstrong.  But unfortunately, the strongIncludestrong function returns strongObjectQuerystrong which is the base class for strongObjectSetstrong.p  pHere is a subset of the ObjectContext class as generated from modified T4 templatep  precode    region DataLoadOptions Functionality              public DataLoadOptions LoadOptions  get set               private ObjectSetltTEntitygt ApplyDataLoadOptionsltTEntitygtstring queryString where TEntity  class                              var query  CreateObjectSetltTEntitygtqueryString                  if LoadOptions  null                                      var members  LoadOptions.GetPreloadedMembersltTEntitygt                      foreach var member in members                                     query  query.Includemember.Name                                                       return query                   endregion        region ObjectSet Properties           ltsummarygt          No Metadata Documentation available.          ltsummarygt         public ObjectSetltAddressgt Addresses                      get                              if Addresses  null                                      Addresses  ApplyDataLoadOptionsltAddressgtAddresses                                  return Addresses                            endregion codepre  pThe line starting with strongememstrong is where the cast from strongObjectQuerystrong to strongObjectSetstrong occurs.  ANd this is an invalid upcast so if explicitly cast at designtime, will fail at runtime, unless Im doing it wrong.p  pOne solution might be to write an extension method for strongObjectSet.Includestrong so that it returns strongObjectSetstrong instead of strongObjectQuerystrong.  I would like to know how to find the source code of the strongObjectQuery.Includestrong function, if that is possible.  And Im not sure if these solution would work.p  pAlso wonder if there was a way to upcast the results of the strongIncludestrong function from strongObjectQuerystrong to strongObjectSetstrong.  Again, not sure if this would work.p  pAny help on implementing a DataLoadOptions capability for LinqtoEF in .Net4 would be appreciated.p

Negative 6051 pAlthough Im a huge fan of Databound controls since ASP.Net 2.0 and have been using them a lot since learning them, I seem to have stumbled upon an unnoticedor rather not cared about issue that these controls seem to have.p  pIm using ASP.Net 3.5 and the issue that I noticed is that when using Databound controlssuch as Labels, HyperLinks inside a DataControlsuch as Datalist, Gridview etc., even if the value returned for one column is codeNULLcode, it is still rendered albeit as an empty tag.p  pFor eg I have a codeDatalistcode in which I have a codeLabelcode whose value may or may not be codeNULLcode. Now theres no problem when the value is not codeNULLcode, the problem is when the value is codeNULLcode. Ideally, no HTML should be rendered for a controls that dont have any value, but in this case, the HTMLcodeltspangtltspangtcode in case of the Label of the corresponding codeNULLcode valued control is still being rendered.p  pNow, as I said earlier that most people wont care about this as it isnt much of an issue, but if you consider the fact that this control may be enclosed in a hierarchy of parent controls, and then repeated many a times, this could significantly increase the HTML contentsince the ID of your HTML content is based on the parent controls without any Text added to maintain the TextHTML ratio, thereby becoming a cause for the Search Engines to shy away from indexing your pages fully.p  pI couldnt find anything related to this matter anywhere else so I thought to bring it up here. Is this really an issue with databound controls or am I missing something herep  pHelp is always appreciated.p
Negative 6051 pThere is a tutorial about Perl threads a hrefhttpperldoc.perl.orgperlthrtut.htmlherea However very little information is given about multithreaded program models BossWorkers, Work Crew, Pipeline.  I have no ideas on how to implement these models. p  pWould yo be so kind to give me some example working codes on thesep  pstrongUpdatestrongbr Thanks Ojosilva for giving some links, I googled before asking this questions I came to two of them.  The first example is old and not good. Two remaining ones are fine. But some more real world examples involving file inputoutput and shared access of variables will be great.p  pFor example, I am a computer expert working for God who loves Perl. He has address books of countries in the world in tabseparated text files, Many of them would be several GBs. He want me to parse an arbitrary combinations of these text files e.g. addressbookusa.txt, addressbookrussia.txt , addressbookindia.txt to do some statistics e.g. about age, sex,  distribution of the world. He want me to show him Perls magic that get this work not only done but DONE FAST, because he does not want to waste his mighty multicore workstation with lot of RAM and disk space.   p  pFYI I also looked at ThreadPool and ThreadPoolSimple modules on cpan. The former is quite promising, but I failed to installed on my workstation. The later is barely simple with no example codes. And again, my point is strongto find something to learn about how to implement of multithreading Perl, not just jump right at the top.strong   p

Negative 6051 pDuring development of out application we have in special encountered a really nasty bug. The symptom is quite simply that the process disappears. The logs just end abruptly, no crash dumps or anything can be found, no zombie processes exist. Dr.Watson havent noticed anything leaving us without any trace.p  pThe error is not simple to reproduce, it takes on average 34 hours to reproduce this error, doing the same actions repeatedly. So somewhere there is some kind of race condition. We have special functions handling both SEH and normal exceptions so none of these should go unnoticed.p  pThe debugging must be done on a special computer, because it is running on very specialized hardware. So only remote debugging is available. And when remote debugging is connected C builder doesnt noticed that the application is missing, and crash and burns when we try to do any debugging on the non existent process.p  pWe are using a great variety of technologies with this softwarep  ul liOpenGLli liDirectshow  some COTS filtersli liCOMDCOMli liSerial COM ports talking to specialized hardwareli liC Builder which uses different stackframes than VCli ul  pSo, as you understand, I do not have much to work with here.

I am also trying to remove as many aspects of the action I am performing to get the case as simple as possible. But this is a really complex operation and this process is taking a lot of time, and time is as usual a scarce resource. p  pI am wondering if anyone out there have good tips for me, either to the cause in general what causes a process just to stop without any notification or to techniques for debugging such an elusive failurep

So my issue I believe is just the KVO portion.p  pTarget is 10.6 only so no legacy issues involved.p  pAny help or suggestions on how to resolve this would be very much appreciated.p

So I am looking for a generic method that can pluck out the value based on a supplied property name and a source object.p

Negative 6051 pThe Seam documentation would have you believe that if you define a property in web.xml, or through a D argument, it will find it and automatically set it on your bean. So if you have a bean called gateway with a property login and a setter, you can make a property called gateway.login in seam.properties, but if you define it in a D, you have to use org.seam.properties.gateway.login. I got that to work with the D that is, but I could not get it to see either ampParameter or ampEnvironment definitions from in context.xml.p  pI am doing this because I have keys to a merchant gateway that I cannot have in a text file in the project, and would rather not have in catalina.sh, since that might be used for other apps. The nice thing about context.xml is that its on the server and it can be confined to the one application that uses the gateway.p

Negative 6051 pI have an idea. It might be bad, for reasons not known by me, but I would really appreciate your feedback on thisp  pWeve been using Session IDs in a PHP project. And for the first time in 4 years, a duplicate sessionid was generated. Luckily enough I randomly decided to go looking through the Customers Table because I was bored and noticed there was a duplicate entry in the sessionid column and changed it, and references to it, before any real problems occured.p  pWhich led or lead me to ask myself this questionp  pBasically, any type of ID, be it a session id, uuid or guid can eventually be duplicated because the length of them is not infinite. So then I got thinking, because we never want this to happen again.p  pI thought, What if we use a combination of date emandem time, as an identifier This wouldnt be random, but it would solve the duplication issue. For examplep  precode14th of May 2011 043605PM  codepre  pIf used as an identifier, could be changed top  precode14052011163605 codepre  pThe reason this form of ID will never become duplicated is because no date, combined with time in the future will ever be the same as one in the past, or present.p  pAnd since, in our case, these IDs are not meant to be seen by anybody, theres no reason for it to be random, is therep  pId love to hear your thoughts on this, and, how you approach situations like this.

Negative 6051 pMy question does have a slight basis in GLSL, since that happens to be the shading language I know.p  pIts my opinion that shaders amp the programmable graphics pipeline are a huge step up from the fixed function pipeline.  Shaders are excellent at applying effects and making 3D graphics look far more realistic.  However, not every effect is meant to be applied to every scenario.  For instance, I wouldnt want my flag waving effect used across an entire scene. If that scene contains one flag, I want that flag to wave back and forth and thats about it.  Id want a water effect applied only to water.  You get the idea.p  pMy question is what is the best way to implement this toggling of effects.  The only way I can think of is to have a series of uniform variables and toggleuntoggle them before and after drawing something.p  pFor instance, pseudocodep  precodetoggle flag effect uniform draw flag untoggle flag effect uniform codepre  pInside the shader code, it would check the value of these uniforms and act accordingly.p  pEDIT  I understand one can have multiple shader programs, and switch on their use as needed, but would this actually be faster than the above method or come with a serious performance overhead from moving all that data around in the GPU  It would seem to be that possibly doing this multiple times per frame would be extremely costlyp

Negative 6051 pIn WPF applications all the views are inherited from System.Windows.Window and have an associated xaml and codebehind file. That seems logical.p  pHowever Im confused that why does the App file, inherited from System.Windows.Application, have a xaml file Although it is an application and not a view It is not visible I know that this file is usually used to define application resources, etc, and xaml provides an efficient way of defining them.

Level 2  GPU In GPU mode, Flash Player utilizes the   available computing power of the graphics card to perform video   playback and compositing of layered graphics. This provides another   level of performance benefit depending on the users graphics   hardware. Use this option when you expect that your audience will have   highend graphics cards. If the playback system does not have   sufficient hardware to enable acceleration, Flash Player reverts to   normal drawing mode automatically. For best performance on web pages   containing multiple SWF files, enable hardware acceleration for only   one of the SWF files. Hardware acceleration is not used in Test Movie   mode. When you publish your SWF file, the HTML file that embeds it   contains a wmode HTML parameter. Choosing Level 1 or Level 2 hardware   acceleration sets the wmode HTML parameter to direct or gpu   respectively. Turning on hardware acceleration overrides the Window   Mode setting you may have chosen in the HTML tab of the Publish   Settings dialog box, because it is also stored in the wmode parameter   in the HTML file.p blockquote

Negative 6051 pIm looking into setting up a distributed deployment of git servers.  I realize this is something git does by default but in this case said servers would act as a single source of truth with all of the assistance provided by centralized support.  p  pCurrently our code base and number of developers using the server is small  a few hundred  but once deployed I expect at least one thousand users to adopt along with their automated builds.  When this happens I expect that there will be a multifold increase in the number of pushes to the centrally supported git servers which will result in added pushes out to the other centrally supported git servers.p  pTo limit the chances of a push storm caused by all of these servers pushing changes to each other I was planning to go with a standard hub spoke architecture where one or two servers would act as master servers, receiving pushes from spoke servers and pushing those changes back out to the other spokes.  p  pMy problem arises when I start to consider the impact of multiple pushes from globally located spoke servers backing up on the hub.  I have attempted to simulate this situation in my lab and from what Ive seen the push process just hangs out waiting for the process in front of it to complete.   In a small deployment this works just fine.  However, when you throw build automation into the works commit  push activity can increase exponentially.   If I decided to create a postreceive hook that handled these pushes on a per client push basis I could foresee a situation where these processes could get backed up on the client servers waiting for the hub to receive the changes.p  pMy questions arep  pAre my concerns valid  Will these processes gum up the works by hanging out until they are received by the hub  Clients would be unaware of this state because the push processes would be forked off of the original reception.  However, they would see that changes would be delayed in appearing on the other remote servers.p  pIf these processes will fail,  do they fail based on the wait interval for sshd or does git itself have a method of specifying a wait intervalp  pOther than monitoring the system processes or wrapping the push command to track its time to completion, is there a way to detect this operation backlog, or for that matter a hung receive condition on the master serverp  pCan you anyone point me towards some threads or articles dealing with this subjectp  pWorst case, a push using a timed interval could be used for each repository in place of a hook based push but I would like to keep things as free flowing and fast as possible so a hook based push would be preferred.p

Negative 6051 pIm currently adding transposition tables in my chess engine, and Im having issues with incrementally updating Zobrist keys. I a hrefhttpchessprogramming.wikispaces.comZobristHashing relnofollowdid some researcha and implemented the basic idea, but its not behaving as I expect. The problem I encountered was that equivalent board positions do not always have the same keys. For example, in the starting position, if both players just moved a knight and then moved it back, the key would be different from that of the starting position. However, doing this again moving the knights and returning to the starting position emwouldem result in the original key.

Negative 6051 pIm a long time reader, first time user signing up and posting. I dont ask very many questions in life when I run into a problem, I prefer to learn the hard way through trialerror and research so that I can learn better. However, I have reached a breaking point and cant find what I need or my search terms need to be fixed. I will try to make this as concise as possible.p  pI have developed a WinForms application that monitors another application that was developed by a previous employee. All the data Im capturing is being displayed in textboxes. Capturing the applications front page data is not a problem. However, my issue lies with capturing data in another form. So what I have done is simulated 2 mouse clicks in order to capture the data on the form I need and a 3rd click to close the form. I have this task being performed during my applications start up and it works. What I need to do, is to be able to repeat that process again whenever its needed. Below is the logic for the steps needed to be performed in the external application Im capturing the data from.p  ul liMain form loads li liClick button to open new formli liNew form opensli liClick button to open new formli liNew form opens, previous form is closed perhaps just hiddenli liGrab the data from the textboxesli liClick button to close formli ul  pThis works the first time I do it when my application starts up. However, if I try to do it again with either a timer having a set update interval, or with a button that can be pressed whenever update data is needed I get no such luck. It will perform the first button click and open a new form but it will not go any further, it just hangs my application up until I close the form that opened in the external application.p  pIm thinking this might be a threading issue since my application is very lightweight and doesnt really have a need to be multithreaded it remains single threaded with the exception of 1 BackgroundWorker. Or perhaps I just dont fully understand the MessageQueue and how it works in my application as well as an external application.p  pThings that might help youp  ul liIm using VB.NETli liThe application is being developed and used on Windows XPli liSendMessage is being used to grab text box data WMGETTEXT, li liPostMessage is being used for button click BMCLICKli ul  pI have read MSDN thoroughly, as well as countless sites to try to get a grasp of this. I try my best not to waste anyones time by submitting an already asked question, or by not doing my own homework first. Something just hasnt clicked yet. Theory, explanations, code snippets etc., will all work. If I dont understand I can research it more, thats not a problem. I just need more guidance since VB.NET isnt my strongest programming language. I can post some of my code if need be, but the issue isnt getting it to work once, its getting it to work more than once. I hope this isnt to confusing. I apologize in advance if I may have overlooked a similar question. Any help would be appreciated and I will try my best to answer your questions.p  pRegards,p  pNatep

Negative 6051 pi have made a python script that performs a nagios check. The functionality of the script is pretty simple it just parses a log and matches some info witch is used to construct the nagios check output. The log is a snmptrapd log witch records the traps from other servers and logs them in codevarlogsnmptrapdcode after witch i just parse them with the script. In order to have the latest traps i erase the log from python each time after reading it. In order to preserve the info i have made a cron job that copies the content of the log into another log at an time interval a bit smaller than the nagios check interval. The thing that i dont understand is why is the log growing so much i mean the messages log which has i guess 1000 times more info is smaller. From what ive seen in the log there are a lot of special characters like codecode and i think that this is done by the way im manipulating the file from pyton but seeing that i olny have like three weeks of experience with it I cant seem to figure out the problem.p  pThe script code is the following p  precodeimport sys, os, re  validstring  OK filename  varlogsnmptrapd.log  if os.statfilename[6]  0         print validstring         sys.exit  else         f  openfilename,r         sharestring           line1  []         patte0  re.compile[09][09][09]         patte2  re.compileNG [azAZs09].         for line in f                 line1  line.split                  if re.searchpatte0,line1[0]                         sharestring  sharestring  line1[1]                            continue                 result2  re.searchpatte2,line                 if result2                         result22  result2.group                         result22  result22.replaceNG,                         sharestring  sharestring  result22            f.close         f1  openfilename,w         f1.close         print sharestring         sys.exit2 codepre  p                   p  pThe log looks likep  precode20120711 041716 Some IPvia UDP [this is an ip]port TRAP, SNMP v1, community somestring     SNMPv2SMIenterprises.OID Some info which is not necesarry     SNMPv2MIBsysDescrOID  STRING info which im matching codepre  pIm pretty sure that it has something to do with the my way of erasing the file but i cant figure it out.

Negative 6051 pOur company has been quite successful in managing its website including all of the business logic and stuff. However, there are also a lot of static content pages which today get served using a templating system which stores the content in serialized PHP objects on the file system.p  pWe are now considering using a real CMS, however we have some requirements which sort out more or less all the usual suspects. The most important requirement is our hosting environmentp  pWe have two completely separate hosting locations with a share nothing approach for failover. Both locations have separate MySQL instances which are slaves  of our master database which is located onsite at our HQ. Both locations have a certain number of web servers each storing the complete website again, for failover.p  pFrom this architecture, two possible approaches come out naturally  A databasedriven CMS which gets managed at our HQ and gets replicated over to our hosting locations and images and stuff which gets replicated using our file sync process  A file driven CMS in which not only the attachments, but also the content files get synced using our file syncp  pThe database driven approach seems more flexible to me, however we couldnt find a CMS which works in a administer locally on a readwrite database and serve content using only a readonly slave. The usual suspect for example Typo3 needs a database to write to for its logging and session management, is therefore not an option. Other CMS seem to share this problem.  p  pSo, long story short, is there a PHPMySQLCMS out there which can handle this Any suggestionsp  pExtra points if the CMS can easily integrated with our Zend Framework applications or vice versa.p

Im not 100 if the provided system function call is the only thing that is different we also set codestdoutcode to nonblocking, but that shouldnt matter.p  pIm really confused, and Id like to implement the END and HOME keys because I use them a lot.p  pIm sorry if this isnt a lot of information. I dont know enough about codesystemcode to really understand what the ramifications of echo and icanon are for stty.

Negative 6051 pI have a basic Node.js amp Socket.io chat application running on Heroku that I want to integrate into my main rails website. I understand the way to do this is to have two separate Heroku apps  one for rails, one for Node.js.p  pIt doesnt appear to be as simple as moving the client html from the node app to the rails app giving it the other apps url in io.connect.p  pThe chat app server seems to automatically call the client index.html its own application, and not allow an external source to connect to it.

Great  code below. The problem is, however, that the client html file only connects when its outside of the Rails app i.e. on my desktop The moment I put it in the rails applications public folder or in a view on my localhost, I get nothing This makes no sense. I checked it wasnt because of any other random erroneous javascript in my asset pipeline conflicting by just creating a new rails app and dropping the html file in the public folder  again nothing  just a dead html page that doesnt connect. Does anyone have any idea what might be going on here Does Rails have some security feature in place that stops connections to external servers or somethingp  pstrongUPDATE 2strong Im told this has something to do with the same origin policy, and Im in trouble.

Negative 6051 pI am writing a file processor that can hopefully parse arbitrary files and perform arbitrary actions on the parsed contents. The file processor needs to run continuously. The basic idea that I am following isp  ol liEach file will have two associated processes One for reading, other for Parsing and writing somewhere elseli liThe reader will read a line into a common buffersay a codeQueuecode till EOF or buffer full. Then waitsleepli liWriter will read from buffer, parse the stuff, write it to say DB till buffer not empty. Then waitsleepli liInterrupting the main program will cause the readerwriter to exit safely buffer can be washed away without writingli ol  pThe program runs fine. But, sometimes Writer will initialize first and find the buffer empty. So it will go to sleep. The Reader will fill the buffer and sleep too. So for codesleepintervalcode my code does nothing.

Negative 6051 pWhat would be the easiest way to code a function in .NET to generate a GUID based on a seed so that I can have greater confidence about its uniquenessp  precodestring GenerateSeededGuidint seed   code here   codepre  pIdeally, the seed would come from a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa37994228vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowCryptGenRandoma which describes its random number generation as followsp  blockquote   pThe data produced by this function is cryptographically random. It is   far more random than the data generated by the typical random number   generator such as the one shipped with your C compiler.p      pThis function is often used to generate random eminitialization vectorsem   and emsalt valuesem.p      pSoftware random number generators work in fundamentally the same way.   They start with a random number, known as the seed, and then use an   algorithm to generate a pseudorandom sequence of bits based on it.   The most difficult part of this process is to get a seed that is truly   random. This is usually based on user input latency, or the jitter   from one or more hardware components.p      pWith Microsoft CSPs, strongCryptGenRandomstrong uses the same random number   generator used by other security components. This allows numerous   processes to contribute to a systemwide seed. CryptoAPI stores an   intermediate random seed with every user. To form the seed for the   random number generator, a calling application supplies bits it might   havefor instance, mouse or keyboard timing inputthat are then   combined with both the stored seed and various system data and user   data such as the process ID and thread ID, the system clock, the   system time, the system counter, memory status, free disk clusters,   the hashed user environment block. This result is used to seed the   pseudorandom number generator PRNG. [...] If an application has access to a good random source, it can   fill the empbBufferem buffer with some random data before calling   strongCryptGenRandomstrong. The CSP then uses this data to further randomize its   internal seed. It is acceptable to omit the step of initializing the   empbBufferem buffer before calling strongCryptGenRandomstrong.p blockquote

Or it is better to dop  precodeDim sCods As New DictionaryOf Integer, String  For each elem In dataBaseData     sCods.AddCIntelemid, elemcod.ToString Next codepre  pAnd now suppose that I have to store subelements too. I mean, for each id, a list of elements, so with dictionaries will be something likep  precodeDim sSubs As New DictionaryOf Integer, ListOf String codepre  pAnd with arrays justp  precodeDim sSubs As New ListOf String Dim sOneSub As String  sSubsidIndexsubIndex codepre  pAnd then imagine there is a lot of data to retrieve.

Negative 6051 pI am building an offline web application, and I want to be able to change the html of the page before the user saves it. since I cannot seem to find a way to trigger the save as function from javascript except from IE, I need to just do some prep work before letting the browser save the page.

Negative 6051 pIm currently part of team building a Windows 8 application using JavaScript. We are using npm and browserify to manage dependencies and convert our modules to AMD browser friendly format.p  pOne issue we are running into is crazy require paths. This is because we have a top level folder inside our application components. This folder contains a bunch of nested ui componentsmodules. These modules sometimes require lib utils and helpers, which reside in the lib directory.p  pSo for example, a module living in myappcomponentsproductgriditem might require a helper module which is located myapplibhelpersview.p  pThe require path is a bit crazy and very ugly require........libhelpersviewp  pWe are doing a best to build in application in modular fashion. Now I would think the proper way to approach this is to have our components modules depend on these util helper modules. I could put the lib helpers into their own external private git repo, but that has been pain in terms of giving other teams access plus git private repos are slow. Plus since those modules are only used in the application, its a waste of time to make the change, push the changes, then go back to the application and npm update. This is fine for some, but if we really break this down, it could get old real fast.p  pI could do npm install myapplibhelpersview inside the components package.json  But npm install wont automatically do this for us.p  pI know of a few other ways around this NODEPATH, maybe use a npm install hook or maybe npm preinstall script, but wanted to know if anyone else had a similar problem and good solution.p

Negative 6051 pstrongProblem to be solvedstrong Im new to DataBases and Im trying to find out the best way to store changes in a table, that is a daily snapshot of some statuses eg. hotelroomrentals table with 20 columns  every can change. Id like to be able to generate that table for a selected day e.g. data inside changes on production, so I have to store it somewhere else, or do some other transformations on it e.g. average number of days rented in a periodp  pstrongMy theoretical example  detailedstrong Lets say that Im creating a DB for a hotel. In the production system I have a table that shows info for all 10 000 rooms in the hotel. This is a daily snapshot  lets assume that the table is updated once per day.p  pSome attributes of a room change often e.g. isrented customernumber, rateusd. Some attributes dont change too often e.g. disabledroom, roomcolor, typeoffurniture. Roomnumber obviously does not change primary keyp  pNow I want to find the best way to track changes in this table the best way to create statistics on base of this table e.g. average number of days rented in a period and to be able to generate the table for selected date e.g. 20130101p  pstrongMY IDEAstrong Since I have no clue about databases, my idea is to copy the whole table every day, with 1 more column, called DBdumpdate with a date. This is a pretty straightforward approach, which will probably require a lot of space since my 10k rooms table, will have to be copied 365 times in a year.p  pstrongOTHER SOLUTIONSstrong On some other website, I was recommended to create two tables Reservation table with these columns Startdate Enddate Room Rate Occupantname Then to transform this table into a FactReservations table Date Room Isoccupied Rate Occupantname I do not understand how does this help me... in fact I assume I would have to make 20 intermediary tables and then 20 Fact tables since I have 20 columns in my database.p  pstrongQUESTIONSstrong What are the recommended ways to deal with such problems Is there any DB schema that is prepared to deal with it, without the user making magic ETLs e.g. a DB that can optimize the problem by itself What are the alternatives How would you, smart people, do this preferably in MS Access... or some freeware technologyp  pstrongeditstrong one more thing  everything can change in the table, not only room reservetions, everything and I want to be able to track the changesp

Negative 6051 pGreetings I will just ask very simple question. Im very new to PyroCMS and I was wondering  if is possible use same modules, addons, widgets and plugins created in Codeigniter for PyroCMS p
Negative 6051 pI have a handler callback, an object to handle and four functions, which collect the data to object. In my case I wish to asynchronously call four data retrievers and when execution of all four is complete, handle the resulting object something similar to the followingp  precodevar data    function handle jsObj    data retrieving function getColorData   function getSizeData   function getWeightData   function getExtraData    data.color  getColorData data.size  getSizeData data.weight  getWeightData data.extra  getExtraData  handle data  codepre  pOf course, this code will not work properly. And if I chain data retrieving functions, they will be called one after another, right All four functions should be called asynchronously, cause they are being executed for too long to call them one by one.p  pstrongUpdatedstrongp  pThanks to everybody for your suggestions I prefered code.Deferredcode, but I found it slightly difficult to make it work the way I need. What I need is to asynchronously make a codeviewcode, which requires four kinds of data codeextraDatacode, codecolorDatacode, codesizeDatacode amp codeweightDatacode and I have three objects codeAppcode, codeUtilscode amp codeToolscode. p  pJust a small description codeviewcode is created by calling codeApp.getStuffcode passed codeApp.handleStuffcode as a callback. Callback in the body of codeApp.getStuffcode is called only code.whenApp.getExtraData, App.getColorData, App.getSizeData, App.getWeightDatacode. Before that codeUtils.asyncRequestcode passed codeTools.parseResponsecode as a callback is called.p  pSo, now the question is should I create four deferred objects inside each codeApp.getDatacode and also codereturn deferred.promisecode from each of them And should I codedeferred.resolvecode in the last function in my order codeTools.parseResponsecode for codeApp.getExtraDatacode in my examplep  precodevar view,     App,     Utils  ,     Tools     Utils Utils.asyncRequest  function path, callback      var data,         parseResponse  callback       do something with data      parseResponse data     Tools Tools.parseResponse  function data      var output         do something to make output from data       So, should the deferred.resolve be done here      deferred.resolveoutput      OR   deferred.resolve      OR   return output    App App        Only one method really works in my example     getExtraData  function           var deferred  new jQuery.Deferred          Utils.asyncRequestdirdata.txt, Tools.parseResponse          return deferred.promise     ,      Others do nothing     getColorData   function    ...  ,     getSizeData    function    ...  ,     getWeightData  function    ...    App.getStuff  function callback      .when          App.getExtraData,          App.getColorData,          App.getSizeData,          App.getWeightData           .thenfunction extraData, colorData, sizeData, weightData          var context,             handleStuff  callback           do something to make all kinds of data become a single object          handleStuff context        App.handleStuff  function stuff   ...     RUN view  App.getStuff App.handleStuff  codepre  pI did not expect the code in my example above to work, it is for illustrative purposes. p  pIve been trying to solve this for quiet a long time and it still gives no result. The documentation for codejQuery.Deferredcode and discussions around this, unfortunately, did not help me. So, I would be very glad and greatful for any help or advise.p

Negative 6051 pHello all thanks for the time.p  pIm starting a new application that will share the same navigation bar content at least with other apps down the road.  These will all be hosted on the same domain, but potentially different servers.p  pI know Nuget can be used to share libraries, but whats the potential use for it in sharing shared views, like a SharedHeader, Master pages.  Each app would have to pull down the new nuget package and be redeployed to see a change in the navigation bar for example, but this code change is in one place versus in each app updating the SharedHeader.  p  pAre there other options that would be better Im not sure how sites in ISS inherit shared views, Ive run into them sharing web.configs in virtual directories.  p  pIs using one nuget package for shared views possible and a good idea, what are other possible reprocussions  My knowledge of nuget, mvc, and the relating subject matter is very rudimentary, but this seems like a good idea to manage code.p  pThanks again.p

Negative 6051 pI have a rather complicated WSDL that I am adding as a service reference in Visual Studio.

However, when creating the WSDL client, .NET doesnt seem to care about this and generates textFieldList like sop  precode[System.Xml.Serialization.XmlArrayAttributeOrder0]     [System.Xml.Serialization.XmlArrayItemAttributeTextFieldBase, IsNullablefalse]     public object[] textFieldList          get              return this.textFieldListField                  set              this.textFieldListField  value             this.RaisePropertyChangedtextFieldList               codepre  pI have some other abstract types in the WSDL that do work correctly and in trying to compare them I discovered that if I remove the strongmaxOccursunboundedstrong attribute from strongTextFieldListstrong definition, then .NET will correctly generate the types that plug into the abstract type. Unfortunately, we need to be able to have 1 or more textFieldList elements so that will not work.p  pIs this just a bug in .NET Or is there some workaround that would work without drastically changing the WSDLp  pOne workaround I considered was changing the implementation to be a choice instead of using abstractp  precodeltcomplexType nameTextFieldListgt ltchoice maxOccursunboundedgt     ltelement refatftextField gt     ltelement refatfcheckBox gt     ltelement refatfradioButtonGroup gt     ltelement refatflistBox gt     ltelement refatfcomboBox gt  ltchoicegt ltcomplexTypegt codepre

Negative 6051 pI made a clientserver application which sends simple Java objects to a server and stores them there. However, serialization isnt really necessary in this context, because my objects only contain some strings and ints like name, phone number, address, age and ID. Sending strings is more complicated, because I need a reliable application protocol, but Im not really sure how this is done correctly. p  pThis is how I think it should work I must inform the server what he receives, send the values in a strict order and send a message to tell the server that the transmission has ended. It would also be a good thing to send some kind of secret key at the beginning of the TCP stream to protect the server from unauthorized access. I would be very glad if someone could lead me on the right track.p

Negative 6051 pI am using a Javascript library which expects data to be in a certain json format as show below. I will use .NET to get the data and feed it to the library using json deserialization. However I am not sure how C classes are serialized to json. Will the builtin .NET json serializer support this json structure or do I have to invest in a more advanced library like json.net I never used json.net. My approach is to do  several trial and error approaches creating different C classes and looking at the output json until the json structure matches the format below.

Negative 6051 pI converted a site from 1.7 to 2.5, and all is really just about done, but Im having one issue. I want to use these two custom K2 templates that existed in the previous version for both user registration and user profile because they were using K2 as the user registration mechanism.p  pIve configured K2 to codeEnable K2 User Profilecodep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com31cW7.png altEnable K2 User Profilep  pbut for whatever reason, when I navigate to codeindex.phpoptioncomusersampviewregistercode its still grabbing the default registration form. Now, I thought it was maybe the URL, but the old 1.7 system is using the same URL. So, with some debugging I found that when the layout is told to search for a file, the K2 path isnt in the array.p  pWhat did I do wrong herep  pstrongNOTEstrong I also tried configuring the codeUser Managercode so that codeAllow User Registrationcode was set to codeNocode, but I just get a code403code then because its just not overriding with that K2 template.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6Lgyw.png altAllow User Registrationp  h1UPDATEh1  pAs I stated in the comments, for whatever reason I dont have a K2 registration menu item type. However, the weirdest part is that the 1.7 version didnt point to the K2 registration either.p  pA little more background. This is a really hacked together system. The menu is actually built with a Jumi module that is straight forward custom and when the user is logged in the link that is used for the profile for example is thisp  precodeindex.phpoptioncomusersampviewuseramplayoutformampid3 codepre  pand the register link, which is also custom i.e. its a link on a custom view is thisp  precodeindex.phpoptioncomuserampviewregister codepre  pSo, in short, I dont know enough about the Joomla navigation system to understand how to get those links to reroute to the K2 views that reside codecomponentscomk2templatescode folder.p  h1UPDATEh1  pI put the coderegister.phpcode view that existed in codecomponentscomk2templatescode folder into the codetemplatestmplnamehtmlcomusersregistercode folder and renamed it codedefault.phpcode so that the default user registration navigation would choose that view. And it did choose that view, no real surprise, but it also failed on a line like thisp  precodeltphp ifcountarrayfilterthisgtK2Plugins gt codepre  pbecause codeK2Pluginscode is codenullcode and thats not allowed for the codearrayfiltercode function. Im guessing this is because if this view were inside the codecomk2code folder, like its original location, this would be available. Im trying everything I can think of now.p  pIt also threw on this linep  precodethisgtK2ParamsgtgetrecaptchaOnRegistration codepre  pbecause codeK2Paramscode is null so of course codegetcode isnt available.p

Negative 6051 pThis question is in relation to my website strongwww.elitedentalstaffing.comstrongp  pCan anyone tell me why the two text boxes above strongLearn Morestrong and strongJoin Our Teamstrong move when I zoom in, in my browser I am using strongChromestrong but have seen the same thing in strongIEstrong. The strange thing is the text box above strongRequest Staffing Supportstrong does not move when I zoom in and is basically the same as the other two text boxes.

Negative 6051 pIm in school learning OO programming, and for the next few months, every assignment involves dice games and word games like jumble and hangman. Each assignment has us creating a new class for these variables HangmanWordArray, JumbleWordArray, etc. In the interest of reusability, I want to create a class or series of classes that can be reused for my assignments. Im having a hard time visualizing what that would look like, and hope my question makes sense... p  pLets assume that the classes will contain properties with accessors and mutators, and methods to return the various objects...a word, a letter, a die roll. Is there a rule of thumb for how to organize these classes p  pIs it best to keep one object per class Or group all the objects in a single class because theyre all related as stuff I need for assignments Or group by data type, so all the numeric objects are in one class and all the strings in anotherp  pI guess Im grappling with how a programmer, in the real world, makes decisions about how to group objects within a class or series of classes, and some of the questions and thought processes I should be using to frame this type of design scenario.p

Negative 6051 pI am new to WPF but I searched a lot and in the end decided to seek help from you guys...p  pI have a class   strongLocationstrong With primary properties as   p  pLocationNamep  pLocationIDp  pI wish to bind this class to a combo box in WPF.

This works well, but on resetting the form I need to reset the value of the combo box to 1. I am unable to do so with the tag property. I searched, and it seems we dont have a strongvaluestrong property like in the strongListItemstrong Every body seems to suggest I bind it with a class and set the DisplayMemberPath and SelectedValuePath. Now if I directly bind with my strongLocationstrong class, How do I insert the Select One item. I could do that by creating a dummy object and insert it into my list before binding. But is this the best way to work in WPF. Maybe there is an altogether different approach which I am missing. Please advise.p  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 6051 pHeres the breakdownp  ul lipI have a form with a large amount of form elementspli lipTheres a jQuery div for a dialog box within the formpli lipThe jquery dialog has dynamically generated form elements a bunch of check boxespli ul  pUpon submitting, my PHP processing page does not register the form elements contained in the dialog as being submitted. Ive come to learn that jQuery takes the dialog division out of the position I have it located in originally within the form, and thus it doesnt get submitted.p  pWhat Ive been trying to do is clone the dialog div and place it back in the form. This isnt working, I think perhaps because cloning the div then creates two divisions with the same exact ID and this confuses things....p  pAnyhow, Im looking for any means whatsoever to be able to get the dialogs form elements submitted along with the rest of the form. p  pI cant believe that using a jQuery UI dialog for this purpose hasnt been done a million timesnot sure whats going wrong. p  pThanksp

Negative 6051 pI am currently attempting to refactor some legacy code. As it stands, I have a codeEXUsercode class, which represents a generic user in the system I am working within. There are several other classes that extend the codeEXUsercode class for example the codeEXLimitedUsercode class.p  pThe codeEXUsercode class extends an active record class that maps the codeEXUsercode object to a row in a user table in the database. p  pI need to create a new type of user e.g. codeNewUsercode that is still data backed, but not in the same set of tables and not via active record. Since the application Im working in already passes these codeEXUsercode objects around everywhere, I am looking to create a new single generic codeUsercode class, which would essentially be a common interface to all users regardless of type. I would then change all references in my codebase to interact with this codeUsercode object, which may actually be represented by a codeEXUsercode, codeEXLimitedUsercode or codeNewUsercode. p  pIm working in PHP single inheritance, so I am unable to have codeEXUsercode extend anything as it already extends an active record type class. p  pI am looking for a good way to be able to achieve a single app facing user generic codeUsercode interface, while still being able to implement that interface via any number of User implementations there may be to facilitate a new user implementation, as well as backwards compatibility with the current user implementation. p  pWould anyone be able to give me a solid example as to how I might go about achieving this Specifically how might I organize the classes listed above, and how would I go about passing around the general codeUsercode object in my code as opposed to passing around objects of different types. Im open to the idea of passing around different types of user objects and relying on ducktyping or something to achieve commonality, but Id be afraid without a clear design, the code could quickly fall ill to poor modification. p  pId be equally thankful for an external reference to a pattern that could achieve this, though some googling hasnt turned up what I would call a right fit solution. p  pThanksp

Negative 6051 pI have been developing and running a small website using apache2 for several years, and once per day, my error log is spammed with requests for nonexistent files related to PHPMyAdmin.  My site does not use PHP, though there is an active MySQL server using nonconventional settings.  All requests are made over a span of 25 seconds.  Am I safe in assuming these are all requests sniffing for vulnerabilities, or is there any instance in which a legitimate sitecompanyserver might need this information  e.g. advertisers and such  As it is, Ive got a script setup to automatically ban any IP that attempts to access one of these nonexistent files.

Negative 6051 pI have a page, including WebView. I had codeandroidconfigChanges...orientationscreenSizecode in manifest and in worked perfectly well I scroll view to a particular text, and when screen orientation changes, the WebView is positioned to the same text on the top this is not same as preserving ScrollY,  because of changed width.p  pNow I changed the design and have different layouts for horizontal and vertical orientation. I prefer to remove orientationscreenSize for the activity to allow reconstructing the page when orientation changes. Everything works fine, but I need to restore the text offset manually.p  pThe closest I could find is  codegetOffsetForPositiongetScrollX, getScrollYcode for saving offset and  codebringPointIntoViewoffsetcode  for restoring offset, however these function are not backwardcompatible getOffsetForPosition wants API 3, while bringPointIntoView requires API 14 . In addition they apply to TextView and may be inaccurate with WebView because of HTML tags.p  pTried codeWebView.saveStatecode and codeWebView.restoreStatecode called after the page has been loaded. Doesnt seem to work for me.p  pYes, I can get calculate scroll position using Paint and FontMetrics, but this is a dirty trick. Ideally, I prefer to get all parameters from the system and keep the code as much backward compatible as possible.p

Negative 6051 pMy application uses Java, Hibernate, and IBM DB2 database. I would like to use pessimistic locking when updating and writing data so other threads need to wait for the resource to be available before trying to update it.

Negative 6051 pIts a general question, which raised from specific scenario, but Id like to get a general answer how to deal with the following situationp  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI have an app, which is using some 3rd party library ad network provider SDK  specifically  codeAdMobcode SDK, based on codeGoogle Play Servicescode. Functionality of this library is not critical for the application. The library creates one or more background worker threads. Sometimes very rare case there is an unhandled exception in one of these background threads, causing to crashing the application. Id like to ignore all exceptions, caused by this library, regardless of their cause in worst case the app user will not see an ad  its much better than app crash. p  pSince the library itself creates the background threads  I cannot just wrap them by trycatch. p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pIs there any way to catch all nonhandled background nonmain thread exceptions and just to kill the thread in such case, and to prevent app crashp  pemRelated questionsemp  pI saw a lot of several questions, but some of them are too specific and not covering my case, others refer to situation when the developer has a control on thread creation and is able to wrap the whole thread with trycatch. If I still missed the relevant question, covering this case, I will appreciate the linkp

Negative 6051 pImagine a 3D rectangle at origin. It is first rotated along Yaxis. So good so far. Now, it is rotated around Xaxis. However, OpenGL API glrotatef interprets the Xaxis to be the global Xaxis. How can I ensure that the axes move with the objectp  pThis is very much like an airplane. For example, if yaw Y rotation is applied first, and then pitch Xrotation, a correct pitch would be Xrotation along the planes local axes.p  pEDIT I have seen this called gimbal lock problem, but I dont think it is though.p

I can intercept page fault using the codevmoperationsstructcode or by modifying the codehandlemmfaultcode function in the kernel.p  pThe part I am not sure how to do is freeing the page and forcing the process into a page fault.p  pHere is the planned test that will explain in details what I want to dop  ul listart a test process, suspend it and pass its pid to kernel modulefunction.li liThe kernel function will use the pid to a get pointer to the mm struct of that process.li liThe kernel function, then, chooses a page from the process say a heap page, copies it into another page, and then assign the codevmopscode pointer for that codevmareastructcode to my own codevmoperationsstructcode.li listrongThe kernel function then frees the page and flushes it from the cpu.strongli liThe kernel function then sends a SIGCONT to the process.li liOnce the process resumes it will run into a page fault.

The country table is in the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb384429.aspx relnofollowOR Designera that does not provide the choice for ordering the table data unless, I think, I modify the autogenerated code for this table but that would mean anytime the table is updated in SQL server I would need to update it in the OR Designer by deleting and adding it again and hence update the autogenerated code manually as well. The other choice would be to create a SQL View in the SQL server and order the data there  and use that view in the LinqToSQL model. But I want to avoid creating an extra object for just ordering purposes. I think the better choice would be to avoid LinqToSQL altogether and order the data inside Controller.p
Negative 6051 pI am having an issue in my Django project where I am importing the same module twice. This is causing a unit test of mine to fail this unit test checks that the view found by resolving a URL is the same view imported from within the app being tested. So, my tests file looks something likep  precodefrom django.core.urlresolvers import resolve from django.tests import TestCase from .views import index  class IndexTextTestCase     def testrooturlresolvestoindexviewself         found  resolvesomeapp         import pdb pdb.settrace            Using this to debug because the below assertion is failing         self.assertEqualfound.func, index codepre  pThe above assertion is failing because the two functions are not equal. When debugging in pdb, I found that codefound.func.modulecode is codesomeapp.viewscode while codeindex.modulecode is codeprojectName.someapp.viewscode. p  pI was told in django on Freenode this could be because although I had recently updated to Django 1.6, I was using the old 1.3 project structure, where the project settings.py and urls.py are in the root of the project alongside manage.py. p  pIve fixed that by creating a new directory within my project root, with the same name as the directory containing the project root, and placed my urls.py and settings.py in that directory. So, my directory structure looks something like thisp  precodehome   joseph     myWorkspace       projectName         manage.py         projectName           init.py           urls.py           settings.py         someapp           init.py           views.py           tests.py         someotherapp          ... and so on ... codepre  pWhen I open a shell via codemanage.py shellcode, import sys, and print sys.path, the first directory in that list is codehomejosephmyWorkspaceprojectNamecode and that seems right to me. The rest of the python path looks pretty normal, pointing to different site packages, etc.  p  pHowever, when I run my test from above via codemanage.py test someappcode, if I print the sys.path in pdb, I see that my python path first contains codehomejosephmyWorkspacecode, and emalsoem codehomejosephmyWorkspaceprojectNamecode. This does not seem correct to me, and I think this may be why I am having issues with double imports. p  pI am not setting PYTHONPATH in my environment variables. As far as I know, I am also not making any adjustments to sys.path within my apps or settings. p  pI dont know where to go from here, can anyone lend some insight p
Negative 6051 pIm trying to implement an application that programs tasks based on some user input. The users can put a number of IPs with telnet commands associated with them one to one relationship, a frequency of execution, and 2 groups cluster, objectClass.p  pThe user should be able to addremove IPs, Clusters, commands, etc, at runtime. They should also be able to interrupt the executions.p  pThis application should be able to send the telnet commands to the IPs, wait for a response and save the response in a database based on the frequency. The problem Im having is trying to make all of this multithreaded, because there are at least 60,000 IPs to telnet, and doing it in a single thread would take too much time. One thread should process a group of IPs in the same cluster with the same objectClass.p  pIve looked at a hrefhttpwww.quartzscheduler.org relnofollowQuartza to schedule the jobs.

But then I ran into the problem of the different timers that users gave. The examples on the Quartz webpage are incomplete and dont go too much into detail.p  pThen I tried to do it the old fashioned way, using java Threads, but I need to have exception handling and parameter passing, Threads dont do that. Then I discovered the Callables and Executors but I cant schedule tasks with Callables.p  pSo Now Im stumped, what do I dop

Negative 6051 pIve found that I cant distinguish controlledcooperative from uncontrolled cancellation of Tasksdelegates without checking the source behind the specific Task or delegate.p  pSpecifically, Ive always assumed that when catching an codeOperationCanceledExceptioncode thrown from a lower level operation that if the referenced token cannot be matched to the token for the current operation, then it should be interpreted as a failureerror. This is a statement from the lower level operation that it gave up quit, embut not because you asked it to do soem.p  pUnfortunately, codeTaskCompletionSourcecode cannot associate a codeCancellationTokencode as the reason for cancellation.  So any Task not backed by the built in schedulers cannot communicate the reason for its cancellation and could misreport cooperative cancellation as an error.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong As of .NET 4.6 TaskCompletionSource emcanem associate a codeCancellationTokencode emifem the new overloads for codeSetCanceledcode or codeTrySetCanceledcode are used.p  pFor instance the followingp  precodepublic Task ShouldHaveBeenAsynchronousAction userDelegate, CancellationToken ct      var tcs  new TaskCompletionSourceltobjectgt      try            userDelegate       tcs.SetResultnull    Indicate completion          catch OperationCanceledException ex            if ex.CancellationToken  ct         tcs.SetCanceled  Need to pass ct here, but cant       else         tcs.SetExceptionex          catch Exception ex            tcs.SetExceptionex           return tcs.Task   private void OtherSide      var cts  new CancellationTokenSource     var ct  cts.Token     cts.Cancel     Task wrappedOperation  ShouldHaveBeenAsynchronous          gt  ct.ThrowIfCancellationRequested , ct      try              wrappedOperation.Wait          catch AggregateException aex              foreach var ex in aex.InnerExceptions                               .OfTypeltOperationCanceledExceptiongt                      if ex.CancellationToken  ct                 Console.WriteLineOK Normal Cancellation             else                 Console.WriteLineERROR Unexpected cancellation                codepre  pwill result in ERROR Unexpected cancellation even though the cancellation  was requested through a cancellation token distributed to all the components.p  pThe core problem is that the TaskCompletionSource does not know about the CancellationToken, but if THE go to mechanism for wrapping asynchronous operations in Tasks cant track this then I dont think one can count on it ever being tracked across interfacelibrary boundaries.p  pIn fact TaskCompletionSource CAN handle this, but the necessary TrySetCanceled overload is internal so only mscorlib components can use it.p  pSo does anyone have a pattern that communicates that a cancellation has been handled across Task and Delegate boundariesp

Negative 6051 pWorking on a shopping store app. Ive been going in circles for the past week and a half trying to figure out how to correctly do this. The problem lies in a UILabel that needs to be dynamically updated with text that corresponds to checked checkboxes. It also needs to know whether to apply selection when apply button has been tapped or return previous selection if customer decided to change their mind and not tap apply. This is where Im running into issue.p  pI refer to 3 controllers as image 1, image 2 and image 3.p  pMy model is a separate class that I pass copies of back and forth to keep selections made by users when they wish to refine a collection of clothing item results.p  pSo for example the user taps the refine button in image 1p  pThey are taken to image 2 where they decide what they want to refine results byp  pThey are then taken to image 3 page where they make the selectionp  pstrongWhere problems beginstrongp  pIn short in image 3 a customer makes a selection and taps done, they are then taken back to image two where their selection is shown in a string separated by commas in a UILabel underneath the chosen refine by option e.g. Gender. If they are ok with their selection they tap apply and the refining is done and displayed like in image 1. A tick is also shown in the refine button to make the customer aware refining is active.p  pNow lets say a selection has already been made like in the images below and the customer goes back to image 3 to modify a selection. Lets say he unchecked microsites. What should happen is when he goes back to image 2 the list underneath the refine by option should be updated.p  pThis works fine but Im actually updating the property that is updated when the apply button is tapped. So if the customer decides they dont want to refine anymore and dont click apply but the back button instead to take them to image 1 then I need the original selection string to be updated in the property. p  pThe thing is this very property is updated whenever a selection is made in image 3. So when the customer does return to image 2 then because we unchecked microsites only men will show in the string underneath the refine by option.p  pIve tried creating a temp property to hold the previous selection but things just really get messy with all this going back and forth.p  pstrongFurther infostrongp  pI pass my model class back and forth between controllers using the prepareForSegue method and delegationprotocols.p  pImage 2 is aware when the done button in image 3 is tapped. This is where I pass the model over. Image 1 knows when the apply button in image 2 is tapped and again this is where I pass the model over. To pass the model from image 1 to 2 then 2 to 3 I use the prepareForSegue method.p  pstrongImage 1strongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFfw1I.png altenter image description herep  pstrongImage 2strongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCmTs2.png altenter image description herep  pstrongImage 3strongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwQcQZ.png altenter image description herep  pHow would you do this I feel Ive made a good start by moving all my model into its own class.

Negative 6051 pI have an app delivered via Java Web Start that is signed with an official certificate provided by Verisign, and also a selfsigned certificate that we have generated.  This is done because we restrict use of the official certificate for the build delivered to customers, but we need to have our test builds signed by a certificate to get the application loaded at all.p  pMy question is is it normal that Java 7b55 still shows security warnings for the selfsigned certificate, even though the official certificate is present  I would expect the official certificate to take precedence but it appears to be not the case.p  pJust wondering if anyone else has hit this or if its unique to my environment..p

Negative 6051 pI would like to know that how can i implement OCKopportunistic key caching for faster roaming in existing WLAN stack. p  pFrom theory available on internet i got to know that Reassociation request from client during roam consists PMKID in its WPA2 RSN IE and new AP generates its own PMKID based on cached PMK at WLC. This generated PMKID should be same as clients PMKID in reassociation request to qualify for reassociation response. if it wont be same then there will 802.1XEAP handshake again which will take time. But if it will be same, we can skip this extra handshake and directly can jump to WPA2 4way handshake.p  pPlease let me know if changes in wpa supplicanttaking latest supplicant as reference will be enough to implement this or it requires integration in WLAN driver and firmware also. I tried to look into atheros and braodcom stack but could not get proper info on it. Cisco have its own proprietary code for this feature So please help me with your knowledge on it.

Negative 6051 pI am new to git and trying to wrap my head around the way branches work. According to the documentation git checkoutp  blockquote   pUpdates files in the working tree to match the version in the index or the specified tree. If no paths are given, git checkout will also update HEAD to set the specified branch as the current branch.p blockquote  pSo as I understand it the files in my directory that I work in the file I performed the git init in would should change according to what branch I am in. I am confused because this does not happen when I change between branches. Edits I was working on before I switched branches are present in the branch I switched to. Am I doing something wrong or does git checkout not work this way and I am just misunderstanding the docsp
Negative 6051 pHave some checkbox buttons in html that I would like to filter the results via the API on.click, over AJAX. There are 3 kinds of results upVoted, noVote, downVoted.

Negative 6051 pGoing by the a hrefhttpdocs.spring.iospringbootdocscurrentreferencehtmlhowtodatabaseinitialization.htmlhowtoinitializeadatabaseusinghibernateSpring Boot reference manuala, there are a couple of ways in which we can import data on startup of an application. Combined with an inmemory database, this is rather handy for testing.p  pThe options are to create a file called codeimport.sqlcode, which will be picked up by Hibernate, or to create a file called codedata.sqlcode, which will be picked up by Spring JDBC. Both of these work fine for me.p  pHowever, I like to break up my projects a bit, so I currently have a core domain model, where there are some handy imports to configure core data such as some users, which is used everywhere. I also have functionspecific projects where it is useful to reuse that same import of base data, but also import some additional data which is specific to that function.p  pThis is where things are not working so well.p  pI found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma4047908395821an answer to a previous questiona, where Pascal Thivent mentioned that the codehibernate.hbm2ddl.importfilescode property could be used to define a list of files, as of Hibernate 3.6.0.Beta1. Given that my project is importing 4.3.1.Final, I thought that perhaps this would be available.p  pSo I tried adding the following to my Spring Boot codeapplication.propertiescodep  precodespring.jpa.hibernate.hbm2ddl.importfilesanotherimport.sql codepre  pandp  precodehibernate.hbm2ddl.importfilesanotherimport.sql codepre  pUnfortunately, neither of these would cause the import to run.p  pSo Im wondering whether I just made a mess of the properties above quite likely. Or is there something else that I need to dop  pNote that as a workaround, I spotted that Spring JDBC seems to run codedata.sqlcode after Hibernate runs codeimport.sqlcode. So as long as I dont need more than two imports, Im able to use codeimport.sqlcode for the base data and then put projectspecific imports in codedata.sqlcode. I can get by with this, but its not really a solution.p

Negative 6051 pI am a beginner in C programming. I want to construct a dynamic 2D array with varying column size which is not known in advance.p  pFor example, from an array A[9]1,2,3,0,4,0,1,2,1. Each time an element with value  0 is encountered, a new row is created. Basically when a 0 is encountered, row value is increased and column value is reset to 0. If a nonzero value is encountered, the row value is maintained and column value is increased. I want to also find out the row and column size for the 2D array. I also want to be able to store the column and row value in other variables. Based on above example, my desired 2D array should look as follows. p  precode1 2 3 0 4 0 1 2 1 codepre  pThe following is the program that I am working on. I dont know how to relate the change of row and column values with my 2D array. p  precode    int nRows  0     int X  new int [nRows]     int S   new int  [nRows]     int nCols1      int array[9]1,2,3,0,4,0,1,2,1      forint i0 ilt9 i     if array[i]0         nRows          nCols0      else         nCols      forint i0 iltnRows i                X[i]  new int[nCols]      S[i]  nCols      coutltltnltltS[i] codepre  pI have searched other related questions but to my understanding, all of them assign the column size for each row themselves instead of depending on other formulations.

Thats probably why esRDD.collect and esRDD.distinct returned 5 unique records, instead of some other random number. But thats still not right.p

What is the correct way to achieve this behaviour p  pFurther, how does this correlate to the size policy of the parent app This is a second constraint The contents should not try to use the space they have in the parent widget, but the parent widget should resize to fit the codeQListViewcode.p  pThis is not a duplicate to [this], since I cant use codeQCompletercode. a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions5721692qlistviewheightaccordingtocontents1aa hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions5721692qlistviewheightaccordingtocontentsQListView height according to contentsap

Negative 6051 pWe have used codeCouchDBcode in production, mainly building apps in controlled environments. Most times, we use a middleware library to make direct calls onto codecouchdbcloudantcode, hence avoiding direct FrontEnd JavaScript calls direct onto codeCouchDBCloudantcode.p  pFor security reasons, it is obvious that for an authenticated CouchDB database brcodehttpusernamepasswordIPAddressPortDBcode brOR for cloudant brcodehttpsusernamepasswordusername.cloudant.comDBcode ,  If the call is directly made from JavaScript, Developer tools in the browsers today enable a person to realise this call and hence has access to your database entirely.p  pAttachments are usually painful when handled in the middleware. It is advantageous to make cloudant handle the caching and serving of the attachments directly to the front end hence relieving our middle ware from that. However, on the web and with a huge audience, making direct calls to our cloudant environment is tricky.p  pWe started out by first of all having a separate cloudant account for all attachments such that, an codeinquisitive boycode will not tamper with the actual metadata or information of our users. So, the only cloudant account they can have access to is that of the attachments since we are making direct JavaScript calls to our database.p  pbQuestionb How do we find a way in which we hide the Username and Password of our cloudant environment thereby allowing us to securely make direct JavaScript calls onto cloudant  Our infrastructure is entirely in the cloud, so we dont have proxies and stuff to work with. We have heard of Url shortening services, CDNs e.t.c. but, we have not come up with a really conclusive solution.p

Negative 6051 pI have a shared storyboard for my iPhoneiPad universal app. The MainViewController presents the PlotViewController modally full screen, cover vertical, animated...the usual. The segue works fine on the iPad 3, but on the iPhone 6, it freezes. Both running iOS 8.0.2, and the simulators for each device work the same way. They dont crash, or get into a run loop they just never perform the segue.p  pBy placing NSLogs in my PlotViewController, Im able to see that progress gets as far as viewWillAppear, but the segue never happens and the screen remains locked up. It never gets to viewDidAppear.p  pAnyone else experiencing this problem Its such a common transition, it seems hard to believe that there would be an issue...p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pApparently the issue stems from my adding a UISplitViewController to the view of the  PlotViewController in the viewDidLoad. I tried moving it to the viewWillAppear and even viewDidAppear, but the freeze still happens. I also tried setting an override trait collection on the split view controller, but that didnt help.p  pMy MainViewController, the presenter, has a UISplitViewController added in exactly the same way, but it doesnt crash. Some combination of the segue and the split view is causing the problem.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThe heart of the matter is the size class of the split view. If I set a override size class for the split view to Hregular and Vregular, the view loads normally. However, my class PlotWorkspaceViewController, which is embedded in a navigation controller in my detail view, relies on being able to read size class, and when I try to override size classes for the detail view controller, it either freezes, or doesnt change my view constraints doesnt work.p  pSo a view with a compact size class doesnt like the UISplitViewController. Any ways around thisp

Negative 6051 pI am in a Introduction to Java class and I was doing a bit of research on variables.  It seems that knowledgeable programers state that it is bad practice to define the variables in public visibility.  I see them stating it is bad practice but I can not find a rhyme or reason to their claims.  This is how I defined my variables in a application for my course.p  precodepublic class DykhoffWk3Calculator                         This class is used to define the variables in a static form so all           classes can access them.                  public static double commissionRate  .03, startSalary  45000,                 accelerationFactor  1.25          public static double annualSales, commissionTotal, totalCompensation,                 total, count, count2         private static Object input Object keyboard  public static class UserInput      Then continue with my other classes codepre  pI thought this was a logical method of defining them so all classes, not just main, could access them.  Can someone explain to me why this is bad practice, and where variables should be defined  Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 6051 pI want to implement the text above the viewpager to fade out then fade when the user scrolls to different pages.  I have a TextView within a toolbar and setting the text based on the page.  I am using the TextView rather than the toolbar title because I believe it would be easier to implement an animation.   How would I animate the textview to fade out with its current text then fade in with the next page text  If you need more code or have any issues with the question I will update my answer.  p  pstrongLayoutstrongp  precodeltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     xmlnsapphttpschemas.android.comapkresauto     xmlnsgeekuihttpschemas.android.comapkresauto     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent     androidorientationverticalgt      ltandroid.support.v7.widget.Toolbar         androidididtoolbar         androidlayoutheight56dp         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         appthemestyleThemeOverlay.AppCompat.Dark.ActionBar         androidbackgroundcolorprimarygt          ltcom.mobsandgeeks.ui.TypefaceTextView             androidididtvTitle             androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidtextSize20dp             androidtextColorcolorwhite             androidgravitycentervertical             androidtextTesting             geekuicustomTypefacefontsRobotoRegular.ttf gt     ltandroid.support.v7.widget.Toolbargt      ltandroid.support.v4.view.ViewPager         androidididpager         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightmatchparent gt  ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  pstrongActivitystrongp  precodeprivate Toolbar toolbar  private void toolbarFunction      toolbar  Toolbar findViewByIdR.id.toolbar     toolbar.setNavigationIcongetResources.getDrawableR.drawable.icarrowbackwhite     toolbar.setNavigationOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener          Override         public void onClickView v              finish                   tvTitle.setTextdbTwoName   private ViewPager mViewPager  private void viewPagerConnections      tvTitle  TextView findViewByIdR.id.tvTitle     mViewPager  ViewPager findViewByIdR.id.pager     FragmentManager fm  getSupportFragmentManager     mViewPager.setAdapternew FragmentStatePagerAdapterfm          Override         public Fragment getItemint position              LogSecond log  logSecondAdapter.getItemposition             return LogThirdFragment.newInstancelog.getDBtwoName, position, log.getDBtwoKey                   Override         public int getCount              return logSecondAdapter.getCount                   mViewPager.setCurrentItemcurrentPageInt     mViewPager.setOnPageChangeListenernew ViewPager.OnPageChangeListener          Override         public void onPageScrolledint position, float positionOffset, int positionOffsetPixels                     Override         public void onPageSelectedint position              LogSecond logSecond  logSecondAdapter.getItemposition             tvTitle.setTextlogSecond.getDBtwoName                   Override         public void onPageScrollStateChangedint state                  codepre

Negative 6051 pI have two tomcat 6 installations running on the same Redhat 5 machine  one is mine and one belongs to another group at my organisation.  Mine is currently 6.0.35, the other is 6.0.32.  I had a problem with the filenames being generated for the tomcat logs ending up with dates in them, which broke our log rotation, so I searched around on here and found that setting thep  p1catalina.org.apache.juli.FileHandler.rotatablep  pproperty to false removed the date, as per the documentation herep  pa hrefhttpstomcat.apache.orgtomcat6.0docapiorgapachejuliFileHandler.html relnofollowhttpstomcat.apache.orgtomcat6.0docapiorgapachejuliFileHandler.htmlap  pHurrah problem solved.  So I checked to see if the other installation was having the same problem it was, and they asked me to help them fix it.  Since their logging.properties setup was exactly the same as ours its all based on catalina.base I just copied over the new, fixed logging.properties file that works in our installation, and fixed the permissions.  But for some reason, here it doesnt work.p  pI can confirm from the commandline arguments of the running process that both are using the same logging.manager org.apache.juli.ClassLoaderLogManager and that the second installation is using the correct logging.properties config file.  I can even change other properties in that file e.g. prefix, suffix and restart the server to see them take effect in the filenames used.  But for whatever reason, the second installation seems to ignore the rotatablefalse property, and refuses to generate logfiles without dates in the name.  Here is the logging.properties file Im usingp  precodehandlers  1catalina.org.apache.juli.FileHandler, 2localhost.org.apache.juli.FileHandler, 3manager.org.apache.juli.FileHandler, 4hostmanager.org.apache.juli.FileHandler, java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler  .handlers  1catalina.org.apache.juli.FileHandler, java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler    Handler specific properties.

Negative 6051 pIm trying to write a spring batch to move data from two tables to a single table. Im having a problem now and I thought of many ways to solve this problem but Im still wondering if there is a more efficent solution to my problem Basically the problem is, I have two tables lets call them codetable Acode and codetable Bcode and their structure is as the followingp  precodetable A column 1A   column 2A      bmw         123555 nissan      123456777 audi        12888 toyota      9800765 kia      85834945  table B column 1B   column 2B     12          caraudi 123456      carnissan 123         carbmw 0125        carvvv 88963       carbbn codepre  pwhat Im trying to do is to create a table c from the batchs wrtier which holds all the data from codetable B column 1B and column 2Bcodeand codecolumn 1Acode only without losing any data from both tables and without writing duplicated data based on column 2A and column 1B. column A and column B have only one column in common codecoulmn 1B  column 2Acode but codecolumn 2Acode has a code3 digits suffixcode added to each id so if we do a join and compare I have to use a codesubstrcode method and it will be very slow coz I have huge tables.  The other solution I thinked of is to have a reader for table A and write all results to tempA table without the suffix, then another reader that compare tables tempA and table B and write the data to table c as the followingp  precodetable c column 1A  can be nullable because not all the records in column 2A exists in column 1B  column 1B column 2B  codepre  pso the table will look like thisp  precodetable C column 1c   column 2c   column 3c        12          caraudi     audi 123456      carnissan   nissan 123         carbmw      bmw 0125        carvv        88963       carbbn    9800765                 toyota 85834945                kia      codepre  pis this the bet way to solve the problem or is there any other way that is more efficient thanks in advancep

If the second example were right, then the diagram in the first example should have all of the methods implemented by the Binary type.p  pWhere am I going wrong p

Negative 6051 pI am trying to get information from two models that are related, displayed in one view.p  pSo what I am trying to accomplish is have the index view to show the list of people, if I then go into detail view of that particular person I want a list of attributes relevant to that person to appear. p  pI have the database setup so that when I create a new person a default row gets inserted into the attributes table with the id of the person under the column called personid.p  pSee my two model classes p  pPeoplep  precodeclass People extends yiidbActiveRecord             inheritdoc           public static function tableName              return people                  inheritdoc           public function rules              return [             [[dob, CURDATE], safe],             [[age], integer],             [[firstname, surname], string, max gt 50]         ]                  inheritdoc           public function attributeLabels              return [             id gt ID,             firstname gt Firstname,             surname gt Surname,             dob gt Dob,             age gt Age,             CURDATE gt Curdate,         ]                  return yiidbActiveQuery           public function getId0              return thisgthasOneAttributesclassName, [personid gt id]       codepre  pAttributesp  precodeclass Attributes extends yiidbActiveRecord             inheritdoc           public static function tableName              return attributes                  inheritdoc           public function rules              return [             [[haircolor, eyecolor, weight, height, personid], required],             [[weight, height, personid], integer],             [[haircolor, eyecolor], string, max gt 50]         ]                  inheritdoc           public function attributeLabels              return [             id gt ID,             haircolor gt Haircolor,             eyecolor gt Eyecolor,             weight gt Weight,             height gt Height,             personid gt Person ID,         ]                  return yiidbActiveQuery           public function getPeople              return thisgthasOnePeopleclassName, [id gt personid]       codepre  pI have generated CRUD through Gii for both of these models.p  pWhat I would like to know is how to setup my people controller and people view so that this may work properly. p  pJust to recap, my index.php view will just show the list of people, if a record exists, you can view that specific record, if you view the record  which will be the view.php file, I want to show the attributesThese will be the default values of that particular person where the id of the person is the same as the personid in the attributes tablep  pThe user will then be able to update the attributes relating to that person.p  pKind Regards.p
Negative 6051 pMy partner created a project in XCode and committed it to GitHub. No new changes were made. When either of us tries to bring down the project on our computers, the Storyboard appears to be missing every single UI element UITextField, UIButton, UILabel, and UITextView. The View Controllers show up, but all of them are empty  blank. In the list view, the elements are there but are grayed out. The project still runs perfectly. If I try to open the Storyboard with an external editor, it still exists as an XML file. Apparently, the elements are still there but they simply fail to show up when the Storyboard is displayed. We are both using the latest XCode, Version 6.2 6C131e. My partner just upgraded to the latest version of Yosemite a couple of days ago, and I am running OSX 10.9.5. The code is in Swift.p

Negative 6051 pFor a current project, I use a number of csv files that are saved in UTF8. The motivation for this encoding is that it contains information in German with special characters ,,,. My team is working with Stata 13 on Mac OS X and Windows 7 software is frequently updated.p  pWhen we import the csv file when importing, we choose Latin1 in Stata special characters are correctly displayed on both operating system. However, when we export the dataset to another csv file on Mac OS X  which we need to do quite often in our setup  the special characters are replaced, e.g.   ,    etc. On Windows, exporting works like a charme and special characters are not replaced.p  pstrongTroubleshootingstrong Stata 13 cannot interpret unicode. I have tried to convert the utf8 files to windows1252 and latin 1 iso 88591 encoding since, after all, all it contains are german characters using Sublime Text 2 prior to importing it in Stata. However the same problem remains for Mac OS X.p  pYesterday, Stata 14 was announced which apparently can deal with unicode. If that is the reason, then it would probably help with my problem, however, we will not be able to upgrade soon. Apart from then, I am wondering why the problem arises on Mac but not on Windows Can anyone help Thank you.p  pstrong[EDIT Start]strong When I import the exported csv file again using a Mac Roman Text encoding Stata allows to specify that in the importing dialogue, then my german special characters appear again.

Negative 6051 pI have a react component which represents a row in a table of words. It rerenders when the state changes, but it does not update codeonClickcode event handler.

Negative 6051 pI have developed a project that is quite big, I was thinking in improving security by saving a token in Session variable and sending that token in each form to check if it is correct to prevent from CSRF attacks.p  pThe thing is that the project has many forms and it could be painful and take a lot of time to go through each form in order to add the token in a hidden input.p  pSo I was asking myself, is there any easy way to add that hidden value to each form without having to go through each form Maybe using jquery, I could localize each form inside the page to add a hidden input, then add a general POSTGET function to check for any request if token is correct.p  pThis is an idea, but probably there may be another simple and better way. Is there any simple, fast and decent way to do so What would be the best approach in this situation preparing CSRF attack prevention after project has been developed. As far as I know the best way to prevent from CSR attacks is using token variables, is there maybe another decent way to do so without having to use a token and go through each formp
Negative 6051 pIf I run a program that exists in PATH in Windows when there is a program with the same name in the current folder it will select the one in current folder instead.

Negative 6051 pNot sure whether I picked the proper title. But anyway.p  pIve got to support and to develop already existing project. p  pIts built on OOP. p  pIve got such models as Order, Product.  They are used very often into code. p  pEvery model is bound to a corresponding table. p  pClient wants to integrate a new kind of customers into system.  This kind of customers has different data associated with them and order completely different kinds of Products. So Order will look different.p  pWhat I decided is to not to mix the old kind of Order and the newly kind of it.  At first I put them into separated tables in order not to break the working system and created different classes for them. p  pNow I have model Order.php and OrderNew.php, Product.php and ProductNew.php and so on. p  pIve global settings object where property of it holds what type of class I need to instantiate. p  pNow Ive messed a lot of code with p  precodeif globalgtobjectgtisNewKindOfCustomer      product  new ProductNew     else     product   new Product  codepre  pBut doing so in many places I got strong feeling that I do something very VERY wrong.p  pSo my first idea was that it should be decided by class Product what kidn of product should be instantiated. p  pIt would be perfect if I  could go to the old Product class and do in its constructor and do somethign like p  precodeClass Product    construct      if globalgtobjectgtisNewKindOfCustomer         product  new ProductNew         else         product   new Product           codepre  pAdditionally I would inherit ProductNew from Product and redefine all methods that needs to be changed. Something like  p  precodeClass ProductNew extends Product     public methodsDefinedInProductButInNeedToBeChangedForProductNew      codepre  pBut the problem is that I didnt manage to find a sane way to do it in PHP and it still smells not so good. But much better than the first approach at least for me.p  pThe third idea is that I will create now just ProductNew class but also ProductOld class what doesnt exist but what I got per se. p  pI will move all code from current Product class to ProductOld. So my current Product class will have no methods. It will get empty. Additionally ProductNew will inherit from ProductOld. p  pHaving such scheme I wont touch code of whole system at all.  Everywhere  in the code the assignemnts will have the following look as p  precodeproduct   new Product codepre  pand inside I will need somehow to manager what  object will be created in  Product constructor. p  pThe fourth idea is that I will create a generic class at first and name it as e.g. ProductGeneral  . It will have mehtods related to both ProductNew and ProductOld classes.   They both will extend ProductGeneral. And inside Product only the proper class will be instantiated depending on the role of  current user. Although Im not sure whether ProductGeneral is so necessary....p  pStill no idea how I can replace this in Product class. I remember it was called something like dynamic binding in C.p  pAre there any better solutions for tackling this problem Am I missing something  p  pSorry for too long text I did try to make it as short as possible.p

Negative 6051 pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9dPRu.png altenter image description herep  pThis combobox is part of a larger User Control written in C that I am embedding in another application. When selecting a value from the combobox and after it loses focus, I cannot come back and actually edit the displayed text. I have to either delete all of the text and manually enter text or select a new value. The combobox is not bound to any source, and the values were added through Items.Add.

Negative 6051 pI have a table with two columns of interest, codeitemidcode and codebucketidcode.  There are a fixed number of values for codebucketidcode and Im okay with listing them out if I need to.p  pEach codeitemidcode can appear multiple times, but each occurrence will have a separate codebucketidcode value.  For example, the codeitemidcode of code123code can appear twice in the table, once under codebucketidcode of codeAcode, once under codeBcode.p  pMy goal is to determine how much overlap exists between each pair of codebucketidcode values and display it as an NbyN matrix.p  pFor example, consider the following small example tablep  precodeitemid     bucketid     111         A 111         B 111         C  222         B 222         D  333         A 333         C  444         C codepre  pSo for this dataset, buckets codeAcode and codeBcode have one codeitemidcode in common, buckets codeCcode and codeDcode have no items in common, etc.p  pI would like to get the above table formatted into something like the followingp  precode        A       B       C       D  A       2       1       2       0 B       1       2       1       1 C       2       1       3       0 D       0       1       0       1 codepre  pIn the above table, the intersect of a row and column tells you how many records exist in both codebucketidcode values.  For example, where the codeAcode row intersects the codeCcode column we have a code2code, because there are 2 records that exist in both codebucketidcode A and C.  Because the intersection of X and Y is the same as the intersection of Y and X, the above table is mirrored across the diagonal.p  pI imagine the query involves a codePIVOTcode, but I cant for the life of me figure out how to get it working.p

Negative 6051 pRecently I learned about REBASE utility and that Microsoft runs it on all OSsupplied modules before shipping Windows. As I understood, if relocating must be done by OS loader during app initialization, this not only impacts on startup time for my system, I dont see any visible penalties, but also impacts on system performance. I never did rebasing for DLLs before. Should I start to do it I understand, that if I should, it would be only DLLs that come with my executable, not the system DLLs.p  pFrom a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10114492whatsthereplacementforrebaseexethis posta I understood that REBASE is a deprecated utility.p  pAlso, if rebasing is still relevant, how can I measure the performance improvementp

Negative 6051 pIm currently writing on a FileHandler, a class that simplifys operations on files which I need for my program. p  pMy question is which way would be best to save the file in my class. Would it be best to save the path of my file as a stdstring and reopen it in every function that uses the file, or would it be best if Id save the actual stdfstream variable. Since its a codeFileHandlercode itll perfom a lot of operations on the same file in a lot of different functions. Down below is a quick demonstration of both waysp  pOpt. 1 would look like this p  precodeclass FileHandler  public     void foo               stdfstream fmpath         operations with f..      private     stdstring mpath save path of file here  codepre  pand Opt. 2 would look like this p  precodeclass FileHandler  public     void foo              operations on already opened mfile      private     stdfstream mfile save actual file  codepre  hr  pWhich version is quicker, saver and over all betterp  pOr is there even a better way For example copy the whole file into a vector and after every operation on the vector copy vector to file..p  pId appreciate you help.p

Negative 6051 pTo the demux the input is a byte stream. Everything is just  zeros and ones. Now how does the parser differentiate between 0x47 in the data and the 0x47 that is the sync byte of the Transport stream headerp  pFor example, if the data that the demux receives is 0x47 0x56 0xef 0x47 ... How will it know which 0x47 is the sync bytep  pDoes it look for any additional bit after the sync byte to ensure that the 0x47 it read is indeed the start of the header What is the mechanismp  pThe same holds true for any parser for that matter. The H.264 parser checks for the NAL start code. How does it differentiate between the actual start code and the start code in the data. Because for the parser everything is just bytes.p  pThank You.p
