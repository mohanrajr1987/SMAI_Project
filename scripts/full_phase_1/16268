Positive 16268 pI wander if there is an elegant way to avoid serializing a null value property using Json.net. This a hrefhttpwww.newtonsoft.comjsonhelphtmlConditionalProperties.htm relnofollowlinka shows two ways of having conditional serialization but both of them are not what I want. The first method is close to what I want but not satisfactory. For example you should create a method for each property ShouldSerialize  propertyname. This is not an elegant solution since all methods must be public and there for visible. So if you have 20 properties that means you should have 20 methods or is there a better way The best solution would be having one method lets say strongOnSerializeobject property, object valuestrong that is called when the objects properties are about to be serialized. Please help...p

Positive 16268 pI have a problem with C and Unity3D.

Deserialisation is fine, but Im having trouble actually assigning the data from each file to a list containing objects of the correct codeTypecode.p  pNote The class name is the same as the filename. For example, if the filename is emCars.jsonem, I want to find a codeComponentcode called codeCarManagercode and use it to store the deserialised data in a codeListltCargtcode at codeCarManager.carscode.p  pIm inexperienced, and I dont really know how to work with codeTypecode references yet.

Positive 16268 pIn an ASP.NET Web API application, some of the models Im working with contain a chunk of adhoc JSON that is useful only on the client side. On the server it simply goes in and out of a relational database as a string. Performance is key, and it seems pointless to process the JSON string server side at all.p  pSo in C, imagine an object like thisp  precodenew Person      FirstName  John,     LastName  Smith,     Json   Age 30   codepre  pBy default, Json.NET will serialize this object like thisp  precode     FirstName John,     LastName Smith,     Json  Age 30   codepre  pId like to be able to instruct Json.NET to assume that the codeJsoncode property is already a serialized representation, thus it shouldnt reserialize, and the resulting JSON should look like thisp  precode     FirstName John,     LastName Smith,     Json          Age 30       codepre  pIdeally this works in both directions, i.e. when POSTing the JSON representation it will automatically deserialize to the C representation above.p  pstrongWhat is the best mechanism to achieve this with Json.NETstrong Do I need a custom codeJsonConvertercode Is there a simpler attributebased mechanism Efficiency matters the whole point is to skip the serialization overhead, which emcouldem be a bit of a microoptimization, but for arguments sake lets assume its not. There will potentially be big lists with bulky codeJsoncode properties being returned.p

Im able to use a workaround for this Getting the Production Database instead of the Develop one and run all the updates we did so far on Develop Patches, Projections, and what not locally, which takes about the entire day to complete. Im probably gonna start doing that while waiting for an answer. Still, its a very annoying problem that Ive had multiple times already during the development of this project, and since the database is growing, I cant spend an entire day every fourseven days when weve made some changes developing which requires a databasereset..p  pIve searched a bit for this issue and Ive seen a few other people with the same problem, but no real solution in my case.

Negative 16268 pI just looked at one of those libraries that is of the naming schema somethingLinq expecting to gain some more knowledge on how to construct expression trees in an elegant way  and was disappointed. Because all I could find were methods that extended IEnumerable  of course with normal C code.p  pNow I have this question Do nonexpression extensions for IEnumerable really justify the name of the library to have Linq in it Or is the author just jumping on a hype trying to get more downloads for his IEnumerable extension library and I was right in expecting IQueryable and expressions when seeing Linq in the name of the libraryp  pEditp  pI would argue that there is a difference between Linqto... and somethingLinq libraries. IMHO Linqto... are linq provider libraries, somethingLinq are linq extensions. I think Linq provider libraries may choose if they expose IQueryable or IEnumerable in their results  linq extensions do not have that choice. As far as I am concerned they must be able to work with both kinds of provider libraries.

Negative 16268 pOften I will send debugging info to my log file from within Java, and it helps to give decent information as to where in the code the log message was generated so I can quickly refer back to it.  I dont want to hardcode anything in the log message about its location, because I have to remember to update the log message if I rename its method or otherwise refactor the code into a different structure.  Id love to have a static function that simply returns the calling functions class and method name.  For example, if I have a class called Machine and a method called doStuff, Id like my log message generation code in that method to look something like thisp  precodeString logmsg  Blah.getClassAndMethodName did the wrong thing codepre  pThe static method getClassAndMethodName in class Blah would return Machine.doStuff.

Negative 16268 pThis is really a double question, my two end goals having answers top  ul liWhat is the standard string comparison order, in terms of the mechanicsli liWhats a better name for that so I can update the docsli ul  pPerls documentation for a hrefhttpperldoc.perl.orgfunctionssort.html relnofollowsorta says that without a block, codesortcode uses standard string comparison order. But what is that order There should be a better name for it. For this question, I specifically mean the situation where a hrefhttpperldoc.perl.orgperllocale.html relnofollowlocalea is not in effect, since that defines its own order.p  pIn years past, we normally called the standard sort order ASCIIbetically. Its in a hrefhttporeilly.comcatalog9780596001322 relnofollowLearning Perla and many other books. However, that term is dated. Perl has been Unicodeaware since 5.6. Talking about ASCII is old school. Since Perl is also Unicodeaware, it knows about character strings. In emsv.cem, codePerlsvcmpcode knows about codelocalecode, codebytescode, and UTF8. The first two are easy. But Im not confident about the third.p  precode for apidoc svcmp  Compares the strings in two SVs.  Returns 1, 0, or 1 indicating whether the string in Cltsv1gt is less than, equal to, or greater than the string in Cltsv2gt. Is UTF8 and use bytes aware, handles get magic, and will coerce its args to strings if necessary.  See also Cltsvcmplocalegt.  cut  codepre  pWhen Perl sorts using UTF8, what is it really sorting The bytes the string encodes to, the characters it represents including marks maybe, or something else I think this is the relevant line in emsv.cem line 6698 for commit 7844ec1p  precode pv1  tpv  charbytestoutf8const U8pv1, ampcur1 codepre  pIf Im reading that right using my rusty C, codepv1code is coerced to octets, turned into UTF8, then coerced to characters in the C sense. I think that means its sorting by the UTF8 encoding i.e. the actual bytes that UTF8 uses to represent a code point. Another way to say that is that it doesnt sort on graphemes. I think Ive almost convinced myself Im reading this right, but some of you know way more about this than I do.p  pFrom that, the next interesting line is 6708p  precode const I32 retval  memcmpconst voidpv1, const voidpv2, cur1 lt cur2  cur1  cur2 codepre  pTo me that looks like once it has codepv1code and codepv2code, which were coerced to codechar code, now are just compared bytebybyte because they are coerced to codevoid code. Is that what happens with codememcmpcode, which looks like its just comparing bits based on the various docs Ive read so far Again, Im wondering what Im missing in the trip from bytesutf8charbytes, like maybe a Unicode normalization step. Checking out codePerlbytestoutf8code in emutf8.cem didnt help me answer that question.p  pAs a side note, Im wondering if this is the same thing as the a hrefhttpunicode.orgreportstr10 relnofollowUnicode Collation Algorithma If it is, why does a hrefhttpsearch.cpan.orgdistUnicodeCollate relnofollowUnicodeCollatea exist From the looks of it, I dont think Perls codesortcode handles canonical equivalence.p

Upon runningp  precoderake cucumber codepre  pI getp  precodeTerm is not a class TypeError codepre  pThis happens because Cucumber includes another gem, termansicolor to do the nifty colored text output in the console, and termansicolor defines a module named Term. Cucumber includes termansicolor before including the Rails models, thus Term is already defined as a module when loading the Term model. Toplevel modules and classes cannot have the same names in Ruby, thus the collision.p  pPreferring not to rename the model, I set about patching the termansicolor gem.

If I want to make some of them optional like Id be able to in curlybrace languages like Java or C, is it good practice to just take the arguments in as a list that is treat the arguments as a list  not require one argument which emisem a list and deal with them that wayp  hr  h2Updateh2  pIve received a couple answers with links to various extensionslibraries that can satisfy my hunger for OOP in scheme. That is helpful, so thank you.p  pHowever although I may not have communicated it well, Im also wondering what the best way is to implement the codepiecode object above without such classes or libraries, so I can gain a better understanding of scheme best practices.p

Negative 16268 pI have spent many hours trying to figure what is going on here.p  pThe function gradlogp in the code below is called many times in my program, and cProfile and runsnakerun the visualize the results reveals that the function gradlogp spends about .00004s locally every call not in any functions it calls and the function n spends about .00006s locally every call.

However, I only made one change to the code pertaining to the focus I tried to to disable the tab keydown when pressed on the last element and also the shifttab keydown on the first element in an attempt to force the focus on the element I want without skipping over it like it has been doing. This is the code I addedp  precodethis.onekeydown, function event      return event.keyCode9 ampamp shiftDowntrue  codepre  pThis kind of works. After the page loads, If the user presses tab on the last element without making a change to its value, the focus will be set to the second element. However, the second time the user presses tab on the last element without making a change to its value, and every subsequent time thereafter, the focus will be set to the first element, just as I would like it to.p  pstrongEdit 2strong I replaced the code in Edit 1, with code utilizing event.preventDefault, which works better. While if a user does a shifttab keydown when in the first element, the focus moves to the last element as it should. However, if the user continues to hold down the shift key and presses tab again, focus will be set back to the first element. And if the user continues to hold the shift key down still yet and hits tab, the focus will move back to the last element. The focus will shift back and forth between the first and last element until the user lifts the shift key. This problem does not occur when only pressing tab. Here is the new code snippetp  precodeevent.preventDefault focusEl.focus codepre

To date, Ive employed a couple of flags like codescriptloadingcode and codescriptloadedcode to try to ensure that I dont load either library more than once by load, I mean requesting the scripts after page load by inserting a codeltscriptgtcode element into the DOM.p  pMy question is Rather than rely on these flags, which have gotten a little unwieldy and hard to follow in my code think callbacks and all of the pitfalls of asynchronous code, is it crossbrowser safe i.e., back to IE 6 and not detrimental to performance to just call a simple function to insert a codeltscriptgtcode element whenever I reach a code branch that needs one of these librariesp  pThe latter would still ensure that I only load either library when I need it, and would also simplify and reduce the weight of my code base, but I need to be absolutely sure that this wont result in additional, unnecessary browser requests.p  pMy hunch is that appending a codeltscriptgtcode element multiple times wont be harmful, as I assume browsers should recognize a duplicate codesrccode URL and rely on a local cached copy. But, you know what happens when we assume...p  pIm hoping that someone is familiar enough with the behavior of various modern and notsomodern, such as IE 6 browsers to be able to speak to what will happen in this case.p  pIn the meantime, Ill write a test to try to answer this firsthand. My hesitation is just that this may be difficult and cumbersome to verify with certainty in every browser that my script is expected to support.p  pThanks in advance for any help andor inputp

Negative 16268 pJust wondering if anybody had the same problem with rubygems.orgp  pI appluad the decision to consolidated everything on rubygems.org, but when the default was rubyforge  I never had any problems.

Negative 16268 p Our company has 4 business entities, so I have created 4 different databases for each company to be used for Human Resource service. Lets call that as a Group, Company1, Company2, and Company3. Even though they are all different databases, tables and store proceduresSP are almost same except Group. Group is a database that gets summarized data from each company. I did create this way because of security purpose, but now it is kind of hard to manage. When I change a SP for company1, then I have to do same thing for company2 and company3. All 4 databases have same a employee master table,so when someone is added to companies, then that person has to be added to the employee table of Group DB by trigger or SP which I dont have to if they are in one table of a database. by the way, I try not to use view at Group DB. I have to keep adding SP, trigger, and job into the database in order to communicate Group DB and other three company DBs.p  pNow I have to create two more companies, so I have to consider this matter whether I have to keep creating same tables and SP again as a separate database or not.p  pWhat is your opinion for creating this types of database Would you prefer one DB for all companies or separated 4 databases Please, Id like to share your opinion.

Negative 16268 pI am testing a web application for security issues and I came across the following scenariop  ol liUser logs in to application.

Application does not issue a warning about this to the user and behaves as if he is properly logged out.li liSession cookies of the application, which have an expiry time of one hour since the last request, are left the in the browser for another user to exploit.li ol  pMy question is, should this be considered a vulnerability in the application or is the whole scenario too far fetched to worry about My take is that since the app relies exclusively on cookies for authentication and session management, it is the apps responsibility to warn the user about being unable to unset the cookies during logout and instruct the user to manually clear cookies to be safe.p  pAppreciate the responsesp

Negative 16268 pI am writing some hash functions for a compiler and I use the codeint64code datatype frequently. The compiler is intended to be supported and so far is on different OSs. I know that codeint64code is a type that can be compiled by most major C compilers for my target systems so thats not the problem. I am using hash functions to make large character strings smaller and quicker to compare and they work wonders on 64bit capable OSs but would there be a large enough performance decrease on 32 bit OSs to cancel out the benefits I could use 32 bit integers but then it would greatly lessen the effectiveness of the hash functions.p  pEdit It is custom code and very simple. The first hash function generates a unique 64bit int from 12 alphanumeric including underscore characters. Then a class handles hashes over 12 characters by creating addresslinked lists of 64bit hashes and overloads the comparison operators. The overloaded compares are short circuited and compare down the addresslinked list. Ive ran tests on my machine to compare speed of randomly generate large hashes 100  300 characters compared to themselves worstcase senario and it proved to be faster than string compares. In order to better simulate the overhead of generating hashes, Ive also ran compare tests of pregenerated large hashes compares against them selves. This is all running with code optimization turned off. With 1 billion hash compares vs. 1 billion string compares, the hash took around 16 of the time. This was all in a 64 environment though. I dont have a 32bit machine to run tests withp

However, I have no idea how to get JS to modify an existing function or simply delete it and start a new one. Pro The function would remain short  Con I have no idea how to do it.p  pWhich would you do, or would you do something else entirely  If your answer is method 2, then could you provide a link on how it is done  I have no problem doing most of the work myself, of course, but I could use some advice and an example of method 2 if it is the preferred method.p

In my DB simplified here, real model is more complex but thats not important, I have a table Orders and a table Parameters. Orders has a foreign key on Parameters. What I did is create 2 dataclasses. The first one, bParamClassb, were I dropped the Parameters table only, so I can have a nice bparameterb class. I then created a simple service to add basic SELECT and INSERT functionality.br The second one, bOrdersClassb, where I dropped both tables, so that the relation between the tables would automatically create a EntityRefltparametergt variable inside the borderb class. I then removed the parameters class that was automatically created in the OrdersClass dataclass, since the class has already been declared in the ParamClass dataclass. Again I created a small service to test it.p  pSo far so good, it builds happily. The problem is that when I try to handle things on the application code, I added service references for both dataclasses, but it is not happy doing something likep  precodeOrdersServiceReference.order myOrder  new OrdersServiceReference.order myOrder.parameter  new ParamServiceReference.parameter  ltPROBLEM IS HERE codepre  pIt comlpains that it cannot implicitly convert from type MytestDC.ParamServiceReference.parameter to MytestDC.OrdersServiceReference.parameterp  pDo I somehow need to declare some sort of reference to ParamClass from OrdersClass, or how do I convert one to the other Is this even a recommended and efficient way of doing this Since its a teamproject, I initially wanted to separate the dataclasses so that they and their services can be easily checked out by one member without checking out the whole entire dataclass.p  pAny help appreciatedp  pPS using Silverlight 4, in case thats importantp

Negative 16268 pAfter a bit of investigation, I found that C0x stores the elements in a tuple backwards in memory.p  pFor example, take this codep  prestdtupleltchar, char, chargt x0, b a char y  charx stdcout ltlt sizeofx ltlt stdendl stdcout ltlt y ltlt stdendlpre  pWhen compiled with the GCC 4.5.2, I get the following outputp  pre3 abpre  pThis initially puzzled me.  Why is the data stored backwards  After hunting through GNUs unintentionally obfuscated headers, I noticed that the implementation was similar to thisp  pretemplatelttypename head, typename... tailgt class tuplelthead, tail...gt  public tuplelttail...gt    head value   ... pre  pBecause the base class contains the last element, then the next derived class contains the second to last, etc., the actual order of the template arguments is reversed.p  pWhen I first got into tuples, I thought that I could use them for a function like codeglInterleavedArrayscode, which sets an array of vertex data as tuples of colors, texture coordinates, normals, and points.  Of course, if I make an array of tuples, this data will have to be inputted in reverse, which can result in really weird bugs if you happen to forget to put the arguments in the right order.p  pWhat about something like this, thenp  pretemplatelttypename... head, typename tailgt class tuplelthead..., tailgt  public tuplelthead...gt    tail value   ... pre  pUnder the GCC 4.5.2p  preerror parameter pack argument head ... must be at the end of the template argument listpre  pUnless this becomes available in the future, Im pretty much stuck on finding another way to implement this.

Negative 16268 pI just started learning Zend amp OO PHP for that matter, I have spent the last 45 weeks learning, tutorials, books etc. I feel good about it but will bog down in the models thats ok, Im learning.

One thing I think I did wrong is that I have a AdminController that does nothing but bring in the admin view that is nothing more than links to each user action in the UserController. Im thinking maybe I should have put the user actions in the AdminController. Im thinking too, that I should make a admin module, reports module, auth module, etc. Or is it normal to end up with 8 controllers and growing I already have the inclination to make and maintain a developers sitemap just for my own sanity, not to mention that I want to do the best job possible p

We have something fundamentally wrong in our understanding of remote repositories p  pSo our question is, what are strongwestrong doing strongwrongstrongp  pThe Error we keep getting from Eclipsep  pstrongUnable to update index for repositoryhttpdomainreferringtotheftprepositoryfolderstrongp  pWe have updated our settings.xml top  precodeltsettings xmlnshttpmaven.apache.orgSETTINGS1.1.0 xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance xsischemaLocationhttpmaven.apache.orgSETTINGS1.1.0 httpmaven.apache.orgxsdsettings1.1.0.xsdgt ltlocalRepositorygt     clocalRepository ltlocalRepositorygt ltserversgt     ltservergt         ltusernamegtuserltusernamegt         ltpasswordgtpassltpasswordgt         ltidgtrepidltidgt     ltservergt ltserversgt ltmirrorsgt     ltmirrorgt         ltmirrorOfgtrepidltmirrorOfgt         ltnamegtMy Repositoryltnamegt         lturlgthttpdomainreferringtotheftprepositoryfolderlturlgt         ltidgtrepositoryltidgt     ltmirrorgt ltmirrorsgt ltsettingsgt codepre  pJust to be sure here are the deploy configuration strongwhich worksstrong, and deploy as described abovep  precode        ltplugingt             ltgroupIdgtorg.apache.maven.pluginsltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtmavendeploypluginltartifactIdgt             ltversiongt2.5ltversiongt             ltconfigurationgt                 ltaltDeploymentRepositorygtrepiddefaultftpx.x.x.xrepositoryltaltDeploymentRepositorygt             ltconfigurationgt         ltplugingt codepre  pThanks in advance,p  pAdam.p

Negative 16268 pI am trying to teach myself Lucene.Net to implement on my site.  I understand how to do almost everything I need except for one issue.  I am trying to figure out how to allow a fuzzy search for all search terms in a search string.p  pSo for example if I have a document with the string codeThe big red foxcode, I am trying to get codebag fixcode to match it.p  pThe problem is, it seems like in order to perform fuzzy searches, I have to add codecode to every search term the user enters.  I am unsure of the best way to go about this.  Right now I am attempting this by p  precodestring queryString  bag rad queryString  queryString.Replace, string.Empty.Replace ,     codepre  pThe first replace is due to Lucene.Net throwing an exception if the search string has a codecode already, apparently it cant handle codecode in a phrase.  This method works, but it seems like it will get messy if I start adding fuzzy weight values.p  pIs there a better way to default all words to allow for fuzzynessp

Negative 16268 pIm building an API and want Ajax to be able to interact with it. The API needs to allow inserting, updating, and deletion of data. Is it a good idea to allow any of these operations via GETp  pFor example a hrefhttpapi.domain.cominsertpersonnamejoe relnofollowhttpapi.domain.cominsertpersonnamejoeap  pMy original plan way to use GET for my getting methods basically, just a simple DB query and POST for add, edit, and delete. Problem is JS sameorigin policy which would make it hard for Ajax to interact with my API. There is a jQuery workaround for GET via JSONP.p  pSuggestionsp
Negative 16268 pi have used jquery and javascript to create some custom rollover button functionality and i am experiencing an issue where a variable is not be overwritten but added to. The basic function of my code is on mouseover of a link, i simply want the link to slide up and double in height so that the bottom on portion of the graphic is showing exactly like css sliding doors rollovers.p  pHowever the issue i am having is that the doubleHeight variable is cumulative so that every time you roll over the link the double height of the link is not reset each time, it just adds it to the last value. Weirdly this is only happening after a lightbox is triggered on the page, before that the functionality works just fine. Here is my javascriptp  precodevar heightVal, doubleHeight  div.flexrolloverbtn p a.bindmouseover, function      heightVal  this.cssheight     doubleHeight  heightVal.replacepx,      doubleHeight  doubleHeight  2  px     this.cssheight doubleHeight, top   heightVal   div.flexrolloverbtn p a.bindmouseout, function      heightVal  this.parent.cssheight     this.cssheight heightVal, top 0  codepre  pand here is the HTML code it is acting uponp  precodeltdiv styleposition absolute top 322px left 13px width 139px height 79px zindex 3 classblock item3 flexrolloverbtngt     ltp stylewidth 75px height 53pxgtlta stylewidth 75px height 53px classnewwindow titleFlexible Size Rollover Test 2 hrefhttpdoctype.tvgtltimg height106 width75 altFlexible Size Rollover Test 2 srccmsarcadiacorpukrepositorypagesstaticstatic0000006614imagesflexrollover2.gifgtltagtltpgt ltdivgt codepre  pTo see it in action a hrefhttpwww.topshop.comwebappwcsstoresservletCatalogNavigationSearchResultCmdcatalogId33057ampstoreId12556amplangId1ampviewAllFlagfalseampcategoryId286989ampinterstitialtrue relnofollowgo herea scroll to the right and mouse over the red star thing, then open a lightbox any of the links with the  symbol next to them close it and mouseover the red star thing again and you will see what i mean.p
Negative 16268 pIm working on a simple file sync tool for Windows that works like Dropbox but uses SVN. I might open source it, its just toy right not but it works really well.p  pPROBLEM Renaming a file... I can catch the event from the Windows OS with the old name and new name. But how can I register the rename in SVN without actually doing it in the file system I know SVN doesnt support that, but I want thinking of some other way. For example a rename is just a copy and a delete.p  pFor example, I could do a server side copy but then the local copy is unversioned. Theres got to be a way Any ideasp  p[And deleting all the old files and reuploading them with new file names doesnt count  ] p

Negative 16268 pI mainly develop Java EE webapps so I dont have any experiences with desktop application at all. Now a friend of mine needed a little tool for daily business which Ive build with Seam and a MySQL db in the background. In case of my experience this was done really fast. p  pNow I want to go further and produce a real small desktop app for him. Ive looked at various options and developing a codegtkcode application with codeMonocode seems my way to go for this little project. The application should be small and fast so I was thinking if a whole MySQL server is needed for my solution here.p  pWhat options I could evaluate instead of a database server which has to run as a service on the workingmachine Storing data as codeXMLcode p  pTo clarify the application has now 6 entites Products, ProductTypes, Colors, Sizes, Orders, Production. On daily basis orders and production are added to a ProductType, very simple stuff.p

interfaces seem to act differently than a real one Delphi has an in between for it to successfully talk to other interfaces. So I just converted the interface to an array of pointers. p  pNow the program successfully calls CreateDevice. I can see this both in the logs and stepping through in Ollydbg.p  pNow what happens is that when CreateDevice calls the original IDirect3D9.CreateDevice it crashes again. When I debug in Ollydbg I notice that it is dereferencing the pointer once too much. p  pstrongUPDATE 2strong Ok, fixed some pointer issues with PIDirect3D9 vs IDirect3D9 in different places. So the original IDirect3D9.CreateDevice gets called. But it errors with D3DERRINVALIDCALLp  pSo confusing.p  pstrongUPDATE 3strong Ok, with some more debugging it seems that when I call the function an extra parameter gets pushed on the stack. Which makes the first param invalid. This is proved further by DirectX Debugging which says iAdapter parameter invalid first param.p  pstrongUPDATE 4strong With using IntRefToMethPtr to get the direct pointer to the original CreateDevice call I was able to get it to call with the stacks the same. Same result. Its looking like Ive went the wrong route with trying to hook it in Delphi. p  pstrongUPDATE 5strong Rewrote the hooking method. Now Im just hooking essentially EndScene. Hook now works fine in a test program Vertices.exe that came with the hook demo found in the first URL in this post. But in the main game it crashes the game. Either way Ive learned a lot.p

Negative 16268 pI am pretty new to the concept of dependency injection and we are currently writing an web app using JSF and maybe Primefaces. We are currently evaluating whether to use Spring or EJB3. I was realy close to choose Spring, but then I heard about CDI. Can you give us some hints, which could be the best for the following situationp  pWe are currently pretty new to the J2EE world and dont know if we will use Glassfish or JBoss or can simply stick to Tomcat.p  pThe web app is basically a prototype for an enterprise CRUD application that needs to be able to handle complex business logic. We want to focus on adaptability, as some requirements are not clear and will be decided about a year later when we know if we can still use the prototype.p  pWe cant use Hibernate, as we will have to write pretty complex SQL Statements. Currently we made good experiences with the SQL abstraction in Spring.p  pMaybee I am currently comparing apples and oranges, but there are just too many informations, if you are new to j2ee.  I think that EJBs are the standard defined through JCP, Spring is the standard defined by the market and CDI is a standard that is also defined by the JCP to do what Spring can do. But I am most certainly wrong .p  pThx,p  piuizp

The client should be able to retrieve that DATETIME in two waysp  ol liif the datetime 20110712 000000 was added by the user1 with time zone UTC2 and then the user2 whose timeZone is UTC3 retrieves this value he should get datetime 20110711 190000. The DST is important here.li liif the datetime 20110712 000000 was added by the user1, user2 gets the exact same dateli ol  pthats it i dont need nothing more. but i cannot find the way of how to do it...p  pwhat i came up with is to store the date in user1 timezone that lets to not perform any conversions at all if using 2nd method. the problem is with the 1st method. i guess i could use CONVERTTZ function, but what should i use as a timezone parameter that list of timezones in mysql.timezonename table is a complete mess in my opinion. is it practical to let the user pick his timezone from this messy list For example what should i use EuropeWarshava or Poland if I live in a city of KlaipedaEurope, Lithuania is it obvious that i should pick time zone EuropeVilnius Why these names are so complicated Maybe there are other MySQL tables which use somehow standardized names like UTC0200 width DST and without, like in wondows ossad I have no chance to compare to other os  i could of cause use offset of a timezone 0200 like documented  but then the DST information is not preserved. or maybe there are ways of determining user timezone automaticallyp  pHope I made myself clear. Help and any advice is very much appreciated.p  p[strongeditedstrong reply to emFlimzyem]p  pif i always have to convert to usersclients date i agry that stroing everything In UTC is best approatch. But what if one user enters the DATETIME 2011.11.12 000000 and the other user have to see exact same time and their timezones doesnt match, what then So I decided to not convert date at all when storing and store timezone together. That is my problem. How to determine the clients time zone automatically Or how to make timezone names not so confusing That setting is very important for my application and because of that I dont want to let a user configure it, but if there is no way of doing that I want that that timezone list to be as clear possible.p

Negative 16268 pI have scoured StackOverflow and even submitted a bug to facebook with no help.  I have spent a solid 40 hours nailing this down.  I belive it to be a conflict between the FB.INIT and the PHP access token, when a server has heavy .htaccess Mod Rewrites to alter the url to a valid query string.  I have written it up as a bug but Facebook believes its a user issue.  I have even used the code in their answer and it is still bugged.p  pHere is the original problem. On my test sites I can get the PHP SDK with the JS SDK to work just fine.  Both allow logins and work in harmony communicating with each other. No problems when surfing pages or performing all the functions Im about to update a client with.  p  pNow Im trying to install the new OAuth updated into my clients site with heavy .htaccess mod Rewrites. Where my test site had no Mod ReWrites. p  pAt first you could log in with PHP just fine.  But once you went to another page within the site you lost your Access token with the popular error An active access token must be used to query information about the current user.p  pThis was fixed by checking to see if the PHP api failed and then using a filegetcontents command taken from Facebooks own authorization page against a hrefhttpsgraph.facebook.comoauthaccesstoken relnofollowhttpsgraph.facebook.comoauthaccesstokena and resetting the access token.  This worked.  But this then caused the FB.init to fail with the response error An active access token must be used to query information about the current user.  Callbacked by FB.apimep  pSo to get around this I had to pass PHPs access token into a SESSION and place it in my api calls. Like so, FB.apimeaccesstoken.  This worked.  So now my site works with Facebook through dominate PHP with JS being a secondary.p  pCURRENT ISSUE  If a user comes to the site and is not logged into the standard PHP Facebook function and uses a function that uses FB JS SD The site prompts a JS Login with appropriate permissions for that site function.  The user accepts and LogsIn.  Everything is fine from a JS standpoint.  The console.log dumps tell me this from page to page.p  pPROBLEM The PHP will not acknowledge the Accesstoken from the cookie set by JS SDK, nor will it receive a cookie from filegetcontents kicks back a failed HTTP Request 400.  So wile the user is logged in through the JS, the PHP will not accept their login and still show the PHP getLoginUrl function.p  pWhen a vardump is performed on the PHP facebook object we see all fields contain data code, state, accesstoken, algorithm and more.  But when a facebookapime on every page which was successful above is performed we receive the error An active access token must be used to query information about the current user.p  pMy Conclusion  There is a mismatch Code generation based off the perceived URL of JS and the actual url of PHP.  Where its easier to force JS to a PHP access token the same cant be done for PHP to be dominated by JS.p  pHeres the PHP code on every page.p  precodeappid  APPID appsecret  APPSEC myurl  http.SERVER[HTTPHOST] facebook  new Facebookarray   appId  gt appid,   secret gt appsecret,  SESSION[fbappID]  facebookgtgetAppId SESSION[fbaccTok]  facebookgtgetAccessToken sigReq  facebookgtgetSignedRequest code  sigReq[code] userID  facebookgtgetUser ifuserID    try      userprofile  facebookgtapime    catch FacebookApiException e      errorloge     tokenurl  httpsgraph.facebook.comoauthaccesstoken        . clientid . appid . ampredirecturi . urlencodemyurl        . ampclientsecret . appsecret . ampcode . code     response  filegetcontentstokenurl     params  null         parsestrresponse, params         ifparams[accesstoken]            facebookgtsetAccessTokenparams[accesstoken]       SESSION[fbaccTok]  facebookgtgetAccessToken          try       userprofile  facebookgtapime     catchFacebookApiException e        errorloge       userID  null          ifuserID    userprofile  facebookgtapime   logout   facebookgtgetLogoutUrl  else    login  lta href.facebookgtgetLoginUrl.gtLog In with Facebookltagt  codepre  pThe Javascript usedp  precodeltscriptgt  FB.init   appId   SESSION[fbappID], status  true,   cookie  true,    xfbml   true,     oauth  true       FB.apimepermissionsaccesstokenltphp print SESSION[fbaccTok]   gt,functionresponseconsole.logresponse ltscriptgt codepre  pANSWER p  pHere is the answer  To allow Javascript to be the main point of entry.

This is the rough code not the refined.  Basically I create my own Cookies to pass information.  Since FB JS SDK refreshes pages on login and logout, I can delete and create cookies or modify them before PHP takes over on a page refresh.  p  pNow heres the PHP that is forced the JS cookie access token.  p  precoderequireoncefacebook.php  facebook  new Facebookarray   appId  gt appid,   secret gt appsecret,  myurl  facebookgtreturnGetUrl SESSION[fbaccTok]  issetCOOKIE[fbToken]COOKIE[fbToken]facebookgtgetAccessToken   sigReq  facebookgtgetSignedRequest code  REQUEST[code]sigReq[code]REQUEST[code]  GLOBALS[fbUser] facebookgtgetUser  ifissetCOOKIE[fbLogin]      ifCOOKIE[fbLogin]1              GLOBALS[fbUser]  facebookgtgetUser         print GLOBALS[fbUser]          else              GLOBALS[fbUser]  null       else      GLOBALS[fbUser]  null  ifGLOBALS[fbUser] ampamp COOKIE[fbToken]      GLOBALS[fbArray]  array         accesstoken gt COOKIE[fbToken]                  try              GLOBALS[fbUserProfile]  facebookgtapime,GET,GLOBALS[fbArray]             printrGLOBALS[fbUserProfile]            catch FacebookApiException e              errorloge            codepre  pHope this helps.p

Negative 16268 pIve searched on the internet for this question and found no single solution. We have a maven project that uses profiles to build artifact that suits devqaprod environtments, does minification of JS and CSS using YUI plugin. It uses Spring for dependency injection and struts as UI framework. Ibatis is used as ORM mapper. We use Eclipse IDE on windows and are not using integrated eclipse as we need to deploy Unix servers. Now, my question is, is there a way to deploy this solution in such a way that changes to js, css, jsp, applicationContext files of spring, struts.xml, ibatis mapper files and of course Java code to take immediate effect without server restart. I remember springgroovy plugin supports reload of context for a change in groovy file. So, I presume there should be a way supports hot deploy too.p

Negative 16268 pI would like to understand how udp hole punching works when two hosts each behind the port restricted cone NAT establish connection.p  pAs I understood, it happens in several stages and involves three hosts.p  pHost A and host B are behind the port restricted cone NAT.p  pHost C is a server that can receive packets from the hosts A and B.p  ol liA sends a packet to C.li liC receives packet from A and determines As external addressport pairli liB sends a packet to C.li liC receives packet from B and determines Bs external addressport pairli liC sends the external addressport of B to Ali liC sends the external addressport of A to Bli liA sends packet1 to Bs external addressli liB sends packet2 to As external addressli ol  pThe questions arep  pHow can A behind the restricted cone NAT receive a packet from B which is also behind the  restricted cone NATp  pThe port restricted cone NAT do not allow packets, in which the source addressport pair does not match the destination addressport pair of packets sent by it, to be received. Why do other packets sent between A and B arrive to A and to Bp  pIs it because the port restricted cone NAT considers packet2 as the response from Bp  pSo packet1 will be lost but packet2 arrives to B. Am I rightp  pThank you in advance.p
Negative 16268 pIm adding UTC time strings to Bitbucket API responses that currently only contain Amsterdam  time strings.

Negative 16268 pI like the random color generation algorithm a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions43044algorithmtorandomlygenerateanaestheticallypleasingcolorpaletteanswertabvotestabtopproposed here by David Crowa, but I wonder if theres a way to focus its results around a single color and regulate the results.p  pMy program will be generating graphs that track a number of variables. Each variable belongs to one of 7 categories. Id like to generate linecolors for these variables that are legible, unique and for which the hue, saturation and luminosity are within a proximate range of a root color which is associated with their category. For example, category Reds variables would be various legible and discernible variations on red.p  pOne solution might be to declare a root color, plus upper and lower boundaries for hue, saturation and luminosity. I could then randomly pull values from within those ranges, but is there a better way to hopscotch within those three dimensions so that the resulting colors have a decent amount of variation, but still leaving space to grow For example, assume each pipe is a range value and each line is an iterationp  precode01 gt  02 gt  03 gt  04 gt  05 gt  06 gt  07 gt  08 gt  09 gt  10 gt  11 gt  12 gt  13 gt  14 gt  15 gt  codepre  pWhats the best way to do this Or is this even the best solution to my problem A single graph may not plot more than 4 or 5 variables, but the number of variables which can be plotted could be in the hundreds.p  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 16268 pcodeputStrLncode when called with any arguments will always return a value of type codeIO code. I agree thats pure, I can handle that.

Negative 16268 pI am working on QuickFixJ FIX 4.2to submit orders to an acceptor FIX engine. Basically I need help on two accountsp  ol lipWhen I first try to establish a connection with the acceptor, the acceptor rejects the initial Logon requests saying Msg Seq No too Low. After this my initiator goes on incrementing the outgoing sequence number by one and when this seq no. and the no. expected by the acceptor engine match, I get a stable connection. To speed this process, I began to extract the expected seq. no. from the reject message sent by the acceptor engine and changed the outgoing sequence no. for my engine using p  precodesession.setNextTargetMsgSeqNumexpectedSeqNo. codepre  pHowever, later on, if my engine finds incoming sequence no. higher than expected, it sends a Resend request. In response, the other party sends back a Sequence Reset msg 354, 123Y. Now after receiving this msg, incoming seq no. for my engine should be automatically set to the one it received from Seq Reset msg. But this does not happen and my engine goes on asking for messages resend request with no change in the incoming seq no. Interesting thing is, I found this thing to work when I dont explicitly change the outgoing seq no in the first place using  setNextTargetMsgSeqNum. p  pWhy is my engine not showing expected behavior when it gets Sequence Reset Msgpli lipI have talked to the other party and they wont have ResetOnLogonY in their configuration. So every time my engine comes up, it often sends Logon request with a seq no. lower than expectedstarts from 1. Is there a better way to have the connection set up quickly Like can I somehow make my engine use the sequence no. resuming from the point just before it went down What should be the ideal approachpli ol  pSo I am now persisting the messages in a file which is taking care of sequence numbers. However, what is troubling again is, my quickfix initiator engine is not responding to Sequence Reset messages. There are no admin call backs at all now. p  pI notice that no response to sequence reset message is happening almost always when I am connecting to the acceptor from one server and then, closing that session, and using a different server to connect to the acceptor, using the same session id. Once the logon is accepted, I expect things to work fine. However, while the other engine sends sequence reset to a particular number gap fill basically, my fix engine does not respond to it, meaning, it does not reset its expected sequence number and keeps on sending resend requests to the acceptor. Any help will be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 16268 pIve looked around and from other peoples posts I think this error is because my activity may exceed heap limits. I am manipulating some bitmaps and have applied techiniques to reduce heap size of my apps such as not using Bitmap.createBitmap and instead enlarging a tiny bitmap as a blank bitmap to modify. I am also using the inPurgable options on created bitmap. Here is my code.p  precodepublic void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     Log.iINFO,At 2     setContentViewR.layout.landingscreen     Thread thread  new

Negative 16268 pIm trying to write a selfmaintaining test tool that can be used from the command line against a server via CORBA omniORB.  To start, Id be happy with a tool that could describe the interfaces that the server implements e.g., essentially regenerating the IDL that defined the interfaces to begin with. From there, Id grow it into something that could accept parameters, make the CORBA call, and print the results.p  pI know that python has introspection that should make it possible to not have to write much code every time an argument changes or a new method is added.  But I dont understand enough of the python binding for omniORB or enough python to know how to do this easily or whether an infrastructure already exists to do this.p  pIve inherited some code that Im trying to morph into my test tool.  The problem is that I dont know how much is something that is stock omniORB python support and how much is homebrew.p  pFrom what Im seeing, it looks like an omniORB CORBA interface appears in python as a class that part seems likely standard.  The methods of said interface appear as members of this classthey are each tuples with naming that appears to be the method name from the IDL prefixed with codedcode.  The input parameters for a given interface method are described by said methods first tuple element the second element describes the return values.  Each element is another tuple of tuples, with each describing a successive parameter.p  pIm hoping this reflects the implementation of omniORBpy. Assuming that it does, are there welldefined routines for interrogatingmanipulating these interface class objectsp
Negative 16268 pI have a php function that does a loop, and the loop pretty much shoots out a list of names, and then if you click on the name, Ive developed some slide down content to show information on that name.

That is not ideal for a record of Person who has large number of blogs. I want to make the Blog Child as IQueryable so that the Sorting and Selecting is done in SQL database before pulling to Memory.p  pI know I could declare the Blogs as IQueryable in my context so that I could directly query as p  precodevar theBlogs  context.Blogs.Where..... codepre  pbut that is not feasible for me due to design choice, I want to avoid any circular reference as much as possible due to serialization problem.

Does this AsQueryable really make the ICollection as IQueryable in reality and makes all Query process in SQL Server Lazy loading OR it is just a casting where Blogs are loaded into memory as like before, but change the interface from ICollection to IQueryable p
Negative 16268 pI am trying to develop motion detection application for Android. App should be able to track motion of phone in space and map it to motion on computer screen. I am using 3axis accelerometer and since data is very noisy I am using Kalman filter.p  pInternal state is 6 component vector [speedx, speedy, speedz, accelx, accely, accelz] and measured state is 3 component vector [accelx, accely, accelz].p  pFilter works very well on measured values, but speed is still very noisy.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.compaNBl.png altPlotted valuesp  pNow I am wondering if this is normal behavior or am I doing something wrong, since my understanding of Kalman filter is very basic.

Negative 16268 pThe dreaded typical linker error.. p  pld symbols not found for architecture armv6 collect2 ld returned 1 exit statusp  pHowever, it is caused by filename I use CObjectiveC, so all of my ObjC files are .mm, but I can never use any .c files. For example Ive included the SFMT algorithm in my project, which was giving me these errors, but just changing the single .c file to .cpp made it go away and the code works just fine I am only including the headers, so Im not sure why this makes any difference.p  pThe problem now is Im trying to include Freetype2, giving me the same issue pretty sure its because its .c, but that is far too large to rename every file, and Im also using a linked binary, so unless I recompile it with new filenames, I cant change that.

Negative 16268 pIm looking to display a tooltip on a row of a datagrid when the user hovers over a given row. The tool tip will display all the information related to that row in the datagrid. I was able to accomplish this using the gridRollOver and gridRollOut events on the datagrid. I created a custom tooltip class that implements the IToolTip interface and set the ToolTipManagers toolTipClass property to the custom toolTip class. This method works for all tool tips except for the ones in the datagrid. Im using ToolTipManager.createToolTip function to create the tooltips on the datagrid but it would seem that calling that method on the ToolTipManager always uses the default toolTip class even if it has been overriden. Id like to know if there is a way to force the tooltip manager to use a different class when calling createToolTip without creating my own implementation of the ToolTipManagerp  pI also attempted to intercept the ToolTipEvent TOOLTIPCREATE and set the toolTip property of the event to a new instance of the custom tooltip class but the event handlers are never called. Does this seem like an appropriate approach and if not, please provide any suggestions.p

Apparently I expected wrong p  pSo further digging revealed I could change the defaults for date and time in an initializer, such as codeconfiginitializersdateformats.rbcode, e.g.p  precodeDateDATEFORMATS[default]mdY TimeDATEFORMATS[default]mdY HM codepre  pThis appears to do what I want.  Several alarming posts suggests that this will screw up how dates are stored in the database, but my tests using PostgreSQL suggest that this is not a problem.p  pSo rant why the heck shouldnt all apps observe the default locale without wrapping every date on the face of the earth with codelcode and codetcode helpersp  pAnd actual question will I cause permanent harm to myself or others by changing the default date and time formats for my application in an initializerp

Negative 16268 pOn my blog app, when the front page loads, I want the twitter share buttons one for each blog post to fade out so the user knows theyre there, but they dont distract from the layout for long. When the user hovers over a post, I want the share button to fade back in, and then fade out again when unhovered.p  pRight now Im using Jquery to fade out on page load, and that works finep  precodejQuery gt   .tshare.fadeOut6800 codepre  pHowever, I cant get it to fade inout on hoverunhover using CSS. This is strange because there are several other links that appeardisappear when a user hoversunhovers over a post, which I implemented with css transitions. However, when I tried to make the code.tsharecode div do the same thing, it doesnt work. The codedisplay nonecode property on the button doesnt change, but it changes for the other elements that are supposed to fade in.p  pAlso, when hovering over the div when the button is fading out that takes 6 seconds, I can see the CSS transition taking place it also adds a border, but it continues to fade.p  pHeres the CSSp  precodeamphover      .tshare          displayinlineblock         positionabsolute         right8px         top8px         border2px solid red      codepre  pDid the JS disable CSS transitions somehowp  pHow can I get the button to fade inout on hoverunhover using CSS, after Jquery fades out the button onloadp  pIf not possible, whats the JS solutionp

IrisCouch is an in cloud hosting service designed for running CouchDb.p  pSo, weve got a CouchDB server up and running, and we know the basics on how to query data from the server.p  pOur biggest confusion right now, is how we should set up the system to work according to best practices. Right now we are at the point where we are able to receive and submit data to the server.p  pOur game is supposed to have Facebook integration, so that the users can register via our app or through Facebook. After that they can play with random matched opponents, or play with friends. After a match is started, one player will get a set of question to be asked, after he has answered, the other player should be notified, through push notification, that its their turn. After a few rounds the game is finished.p  pAt this point, we think this might be the best solution for the flow of the applicationp  ol liA user connects to another user  a game session is opened as a document in a database called games.li liThe newly created document contains both player names, question, answers etcli liA field named whosturn decides which of the two players turn it is.li liAfter the game has ended, the session is erased.li ol  pAgain, and as you may see, we are in the dark as of how to really do it, but this is the general idea.p  pSo, my questions goes as followingp  pstrongIs it best to query the data directly from the iPhone application, or through a web servicestrongp  pstrongWhat is the best way to set up the database, to best manage the flow of the applicationstrongp  pAny information, that could lead us closer will be gladly appreciated p  pIn advance, thank youp  pOlav Gundersenp  hr  pstrongEDIT1  Our ObjectiveC programmer managed to connect two iPhone devices using CouchDb.

Negative 16268 pI am working on a system that allows the user to generate objects from objects. It is similar to the Win7 sticky note system a sticky note can make a new sticky note, and delete itself. I am trying to implement this with jquery, yet there is a duplication issue when i try to add new objects. p  pIn jquery i tell the code to make a second object which is a variable that holds the html for an object that contains an add and delete button in it. If you view the html page, it makes more sense. When I tell jquery to make the object, it does perfectly. Except that the object that it made does not make more objects jquery for some reason does not recognize the presence of the new object that it just created. And as a solution i tried restating the .click functions that listen for the user to click on the add or delete buttons.

Negative 16268 pI have a winform application that contains, by default, a ui with about a dozen standard components. Each set of components represents a hardware device which the application communicates with. I need to be able replicate, or duplicate multiple instances of this set of controls so that the main form contains 1, 10, or 100 instances of this UI, using a tab interface to hold each set of 10 control interfaces. Im looking for suggestions on how to best handle and manage this. In other words, how to best create and manage multiple instances of what might normally be a single user interface. Im thinking I can easily create a list of objects, each one being a container of all the components that make up a single representation of the hardware being communicated with.p  pWhile Ive created the interface using the designer, Im thinking it may not be practical to use the designer for the creation of all the additional component sets, which will be determined at installation time. I guess essentially I need a list or array of the this.components object container for each instance of the interface. Any suggestions on how to approach and tackle such a problem would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks,p  pGaryp

Negative 16268 pIm trialling Sahi for test automation. Im trying to complete forms built with Orbeon forms. Im using IE9 on Windows 7.p  pBasically I complete a form thats got tabs and links to different stages required for submission. It also includes attaching a file or files.p  pTests done with Firefox and Chrome work fine, with the exception that the file uploads, even though they dont generate an error, the files dont actually get uploaded. p  pRunning the same test on IE9 generates script error.  So, Ive created a specific test using IE9.  This runs without generating any error but all text input fields and dropdown fields end up blank when examined.  Also, files dont get uploaded.p  pAny idea as to what could be the problemp  pThanks in advance...p

Negative 16268 pSome time back I started using EF as a DAL and from tutorials and videos come to know about repository pattern and Unit of work patterns. p  pAbout repository I learned it is an abstraction over DAL and it separate business logic from data access code.

Negative 16268 pThe documentation mentions the ability to do masterslave by passing the MasterSlaveFeature to a TableGateway constructor along with the slave adapter as a parameter to the MasterSlaveFeature. My question is how to get access to that slave adapter when instantiating the TableGateway object. p  pIm setting my master up in the main global and local configuration files, as per the quick start. How would I go about configuring the slave adapters and how would I set up more than one slavep  pIs there a working example of how to do thisp  pUPDATE Ive made some progress on this. In the global config file, I added another array key called slave and entered the connection information there. Then I created a SlaveAdapterServiceFactory class which mimics the behavior of ZendDbAdapterAdapterServiceFactory but grabs the slave config key values instead of db. Then, in my module config where I do the constructor injection of the master adapter, I also grab the slave adapter and pass it to my model table as the constructor parameter to a new MasterSlaveFeature instance. I also had to alter my model table class to look for Feature stuff getting passed in the constructor. Since the modal table class extends AbstractTableGateway I would expect it to know what to do with the Feature. Hopefully that assumption is correct.

Negative 16268 pstrongEDIT PROBLEM SOLVEDstrong  I had a pretty silly error.p  pIve got a MapReduce pipeline consisting of a map, reduce, map, and reduce.  I use SequenceFileOutputFormat for the first reduce, and SequenceFileInputFormat for the second map.   Ive looked at usage for it, and it seems like Im using it right.  The types that Im putting into this are IntWritable and IntPairArrayWritable a custom ArrayWritable subclass that uses IntPairWritable from mahout.  The problem is that when reading the IntPairArrayWritable in the second map, I get a ClassCastException when I try to get individual IntPairWritables out.  Im not sure if this is due to an error in how Im using the ArrayWritable class or if its something wrong with my use of SequenceFileInput,OutputFormat.

In the end I want to only have a button which when I click it it displays the file upload dialog, and when I select something there it automatically uploads the file.p  pFor the automatic submit I know that I must write a handler for the onChange event of the file upload dialog. Thus this is not the problem. But is there a way to disable the textfield without having to resort to CSS when I select a file to upload the name is written into the textfield....and I want to either eliminate the textfield or at least make it invisible. p

Negative 16268 pI was wondering the protocol for dealing with memory leaks with pointers to dynamic memory being returned in C and C. For example, strtok returns a char. Presumably, the pointer that is returned must eventually be freeddeleted. I note that the a hrefhttpwww.cplusplus.comreferenceclibrarycstringstrtok relnofollowreference pagea doesnt even mention this. Is that because this is simply assumed Also, how do you know whether to delete or free Does one have to do research to find out what language each function was originally in, and then assume that all C programs use mallocfree and C uses newdeletep

Negative 16268 pIm writing a relatively complex function to do a starttofinish data analysis. This function calls lots of subfunctions I have written which themselves call subsubfunctions, etc.. Im looking for a tool to tell me how much time my function is spending on each subfunction amp subsubfunction, in order to see where I should look for performance improvements.

Negative 16268 pOk, so I realize this has been discussed over and over as I have read countless number of Stack Overflow threads, and articles on the web. I currently have a TCP Asynchronous C .NET Server running on a VPS. p  pI have gotten this to work well for the multiplayer lobbies such as connecting players to the game and what not. My main problem is when the game starts, as It becomes really blocky. So upon my research p  pI found some very helpful threads on Interpolation in which they guided me towards a basic Difference Serverpos  Localpos  Deltatime Time between server updates  Interpolation Constant. This worked in the sense that it smoothed out the frame rate, but I still had a momentary lag on the server update times. p  pHowever my main problem is that I am using the accelerometer to update the position of each player, however my server cant receive that data and process it as fast as the accelerometer updates which causes it the start messing up.p  pSo today I tried simply sending data to the server, however my max transfer time is around 350MS, that keeps it from combining messages on accident. p  pI then came across Dead Reckoning, which would work in theory however since you wouldnt be keeping track of paddle positions up to date in theory. What happens when the ball hits your opponents paddle Do you automatically jerk the paddle into position and reverse the ball position p  pBasically I think I have spun myself in a big circle, by just theorizing different ways of doing this. I am also aware of UDP, but I cant imagine a Pong multiplayer would require me to run a UDP connection, there has to be a way to use TCP.p  pAnyways, thank you for any help you guys give me. I am new to this and I think have gotten lost in the web of Networking. p

Negative 16268 pbr I am in a rather nasty situation. We use compass for Hibernate search integration with Lucene and have implemented database directory search using strongJdbcDirectorystrong instead of FSDirectoryProvider, RAMDirectoryProvider etc.p  pThe problem is that the directory provider is passed as a property inside the METAINFpersistence.xml like the one belowp  precodeltproperty namehibernate.search.default.directoryprovider valueuk.company.package.JdbcDirectoryProvider gt codepre  pWe need to pass the database details to the the JdbcDirectoryProvider as strongJdbcDirectorystrong requires a datasource to be passed. p  pWe are constructing the datasource for the directory provider in an unconventional way using a property file in the class path with the database and index details.p  pIf we have stronguk.company.JdbcDirectoryProviderstrong configured as a spring bean, we can inject the datasource. This works well with Tomcat but not with OAS or Weblogic as still as we are passing the directoryprovider in the persistence.xml. Probably becasue the datasource is initialized by the spring becasue of the way classloaders work in these app servers. p  pMy question is how can we configure the stronghibernate.search.default.directoryproviderstrong directly inside aSpring bean instead of the persistence.xmlp  pThe closest place isp  precodeltbean classorg.springframework.orm.jpa.vendor.HibernateJpaVendorAdaptergt codepre  pBut it only takes three propertiesp  precodeltproperty nameshowSql valuetrue gt ltproperty namegenerateDdl valuefalse gt ltproperty namedatabasePlatform valueorg.hibernate.dialect.Oracle10gDialect gt codepre  pstrongSolutionstrongp  pYou could pass the hibernate properties in spring bean as strongjpaPropertiesstrong  p  precodeltproperty namejpaPropertiesgt     ltpropsgt        ltprop keyhibernate.search.default.directoryprovidergt        uk.company.package.JdbcDirectoryProvider      ltpropgt     ltpropsgt ltpropertygt codepre

Negative 16268 pI am working on processing average CPU loads on some of my servers in Excel 2013. I have my raw data in a table named RawData which contains the CPU load and a timestamp in each row. From RawData I created two pivot tables loadDaily and loadHourly. In loadDaily, I set the timestamp as a row lable, and set it to group by Days, Hours, Minutes and created a nice chart of my CPU load from it. Now the problem I am having is when I try to group the timestamp field in loadHourly by Hours only, it also applies the grouping to my other pivot table loadDaily and my pivot chart linked to that. How do I make the grouping on the timestamp field only apply to loadHourlyp

Negative 16268 pWhat I want to do overall is add an ellipse to a canvas to represent the position of a golf ball on the Circumference of a circle when it is struck at a certain angle by a golf putter from the center of that circle.

The other image is just a putter head that is rotated to represent the angle which the club hits the ball at. This image sits on top of the circle image.

Negative 16268 pI see this question asked frequently and I have done extensive experimentation to try to get this to work.  However everyone elses examples and answers have so far failed me.

I am certain the UpdatePanel I am targeting is not updating.p  pI have tried the following approachesp  ul liUsing the server side method to manually update a conditional UpdatePanel  this fails because the file upload is done in a frame.

Negative 16268 pIn my ASP.Net MVC4 project, I have a form in a view and a controller method that handles the submit of the form.  In the controller method, I have a formcollection parameter to retrieve the submitted form values.  The first time I post, the formcollection correctly shows all the values I entered in the form.  If there is a issue with field validation, I redisplay the same view so the user can correct the issues.  The problem I am having is that when one or more form field values are changed and the form is resubmitted back to the same controller method, the Formcollection does NOT show the updated form values.  Instead it still contains the values from the first form submission.  Why is this happening  How can I make the formcollection show the updated values on form resubmission  p

Negative 16268 pLets say I have a table that contains ids that relate to other tables. I want to get all the objects because the combination of the tables makes up one object.

If I remove the optional fields from the query all together though it works.

Does it hurt perfomance Will it harm Excel p  pMany will also say that with good coding I dont have to kill the process. Maybe, but that doesnt answer the question of Why is it bad to kill the process After closing the files, quitting Excel and releasing the objects why would it be a bad thing to just make absolutely sure the process is gonep  pEdit Also what is actually left after Excel quits If Excel was visible, it appears to quit normally, disappearing from view and from the taskbar. So did Excel actually quit or didnt it. It seems to me that Excel actually did quit and that we only have an empty process shell running. Can anyone comment on thatp  pEdit It is interesting to me to note that GC aka Garbage Collection via GC.Collect GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers will actually release the process shell that is left behind after Excel quits. Does that support my assumption that the empty process shell really is garbage after allp  pEdit just found an excellent website on the problem a hrefhttpdevcity.netPrintArticle.aspxArticleID239 relnofollow50 Ways to kill Excelap
Negative 16268 pHi I have a Joomla3 site that has a main menu with a root item products.  The sef url sitenameproducts works great.  However, I also want to have an sef url for sitenameproductsproductmodel1 that is not displayed in the menu.  If I try to create a productsproductmodel1 menu tree in a second phantom menu that isnt displayed anywhere, I cant create a duplicate root alias for products.   Is there any workaround so I can either set up the phantom menu with the same root aliases as the main menu, or hide the menu items in the main menu so the sef links work but the menu items are not displayed  I tried adding System LinkMenu item aliases to the phantom menu, but it is still using the system generated aliases to create the sef urls.p

Negative 16268 pI have a MultiView with two views first one with form and second one to review data entered in first view. First view contains a TextBox and a PlaceHolder. The PlaceHolder is used to hold dynamically added add UserControl. UserControl contains DropDownLists, TextBox, and CheckBox.    Working fine Currently I can add new user control in the page through a Add button, which causes the page to PostBack but I do not lose any data in existing dynamic UserControl.

Negative 16268 pIm relatively new to the Fusion Tables Api and I am trying to create a simple web app using Fusion Tables and Google Maps Api. The application will be used about three times a day and each time a new set of data will be added to the table, replacing the old entries with new ones. p  pSo far, the application is working as expected, except for when changes are made to the fusion table. When I add or delete multiple rows from the table manually through the Fusion Table page and then return to my app, I notice that the styles stop working properly, and in many cases do not appear at all however, after about an hour everything starts working normally again. p  pThe code I use for creating the styles is this,p  precodelayer  new google.maps.FusionTablesLayer     query        select geometry,       from 11CIZUlNjBPiOM1Y4pDUPMn9TxkqF0etfpWhi5c     ,     styles[              polygonOptions                 fillColor FF0000,                          fillOpacity 0.05                       ,              where Location LIKE PERDUE,         polygonOptions          fillColor 0000FF         fillOpacity0.2               ,              where GeoBlock  AC1C,         polygonOptions          fillColor 0000FF         fillOpacity0.8              ,              where Location  BENGOUGH,         polygonOptions          fillColor 0000FF         fillOpacity0.99                ]       layer.setMapmap codepre  pIve researched a bit to see if anyone else is having similar issues, and the closest thing that Ive come across that is similar to the problem I am having is that it may be a cache issue with the browser, but Ive tested this scenario with multiple machines at the same time and have been getting the same result and Ive also added the nocache tag to my code to prevent the browser from caching the styles. Im not sure if this is an Api issue or something else. I will appreciate any suggestions on how to approach this problem.p  pThanks, p

My question is Is there a way to increase the memory size or array size limit in PHP so that I can grab all the items at oncep  pHere is my script.p  precodesettimelimit0   worktempmedium defineBASE, DIRECTORYSEPARATOR.DIRECTORYSEPARATOR.work.DIRECTORYSEPARATOR.temp.DIRECTORYSEPARATOR.medium.DIRECTORYSEPARATOR      files  globBASE . 1.jpg       echo printrfiles,true      die     count  0     foreach files as k gt v          v  strreplaceBASE, , v          echo v         count.rn         echo count            die codepre  pI know there are 120,000 items in this folder but my count only gets up to 20,006.  A curious number so I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on this for mep  pThis is a command line script running locally on the machine the files are on a network drive. p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 16268 pIm writing a Go program that uses the GNU readline library for a fancy command line interface. In order to simplify the installing process and not worry about the library version and other stuff, I want to link it statically.p  pThe problem is I dont really know how to do it. If I precompile the library, I would have to provide several versions of my code, with the different versions of the .a or .lib readline library. To avoid this problem I was thinking of just including the current readline code to my go project, and let the go tool compile it when it build the go project. However, to build the readline library, is necessary to use codemakecode. Is there a way of telling the go tool how to build the C codep
Negative 16268 pstrong2nd EDIT Details added with change codestrongp  pI have an alphabet equivalent numerical code in array of string that I want to be output when a word OR sentence is input. Here is my c code for that. It gets user input amp output a beep for equivalent time for all numerical digit for all alphabets in a full word like morse code would do. Basically I need this for my embedded application but 1st I want to have it working in typical C then I move it to embedded.p  pCurrently it works like e.g. alphabet i has numerical code 24, when executed amp i is given as input, it beeps first two times with a sleep time of INNERLOOP between those i.e. 450. Then it sleeps for OUTERLOOP i.e. 700 and then beeps for 4 times with INNERLOOP sleep time. So it is possible to recognize that it beeps 2 times, wait amp then beeps 4 times  i.e. transmitting 24 that is code for i. If I input ii it does same twice i.e. starts beep for 2nd i after INNERLOOP sleep time so code appears like 2424. Its not possible to recognize it was was 24 amp again 24. It should work like 24 read as described before than a looooong wait amp 24 again raed, so user may recognize code for two alphabets i.e. ii or any other combination.  p  pWhat I want it to introduce a THIRDSLEEP time that occurs between any two alphabets of same word so that each alphabet code can be read separately. Currently its only between numerical code of same alphabet.         p  pHere is my code so far      p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltstringgt include ltsstreamgt include ltwindows.hgt  using namespace std  string texttopatternchar c  Hello world again 12515123123135 13461351235123145 112451241345      string alphabet  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwqyz osv     string code[]  1,12,14,145, 15, 124, 1245,                       125, 24, 245, 13, 123, 134,                       1345, 135, 1234, 12345, 1235, 234, 2345,                       136, 1236, 1346, 13456, 1356, 12346     int index  alphabet.findc     ifindex1         return code[index]     else         return     int main      const int OUTERSLEEP  700,               INNERSLEEP  450     int n     string ord     getlinecin, ord     string code     forint i0 iltord.length i              code  texttopatternord[i]           forint i  0 iltcode.length i              n  code[i]  0         forint j0 jltn j                      coutltlta             SleepINNERSLEEP                  SleepOUTERSLEEP          return 0  codepre

When we increment the counter in the inner loop, it seems to only be a local variable for the inner loop  so it will increment while inside the loop, but then that local cnt is gone. HOW can we modify the global cntp  pAs great as the Jinja2 doc may be, they are unclear about set variable scopes. The only thing mentioning scope was the scoped modifier for inner blocks, but I guess it cant be applied to everything ... crazy.p

Negative 16268 pIm trying to put together what seems to be a simple case of two NSTextFields with dynamic width and fixed spacing in between. I cannot figure out an effective way to do so though.p  pIm looking to get something like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comS0MCS.png altGoalp  pThe blue boxes are the NSTextFields. When more text is entered into one, it should grow and thus make the other one shrink, maintaining the lead space, trailing space and the spacing in between the fields. The first one should take the priority if both of the fields have too much text. Each field will also clearly have a maximum and a minimum possible width it can reach.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4OBez.png altExamplesp  pHow would I go around handling this, preferably utilising IB autolayout as much as possiblep

Negative 16268 pI am tasked with modularizing a C app that is a rewrite of a very large Delphi app the DB has 249 tables. Business constraints proscribe a complete redesign for .NET and better overall architecture, so we are basically just incrementally rewriting module for module of the Delphi app in C. Until finished, the suite will comprise a mixture of pending rewrites, and C app modules I want to integrate using MEF.p  pThe app concerns itself with TimeandAttendance and AccessControl, and has diverse business areas like Employee Leave and Visitors. I think these should be separate projects, where we can swap out a rewritten C project, and it will be imported into the MEF container. Each project will export an codeIBusinessAreacode, as a highest level definition, then these will export standard, shared interfaces like codeIServicecode, that introduce the services available in a business area, like codeCreateEmployeecode. Each service will be a class, in order to standardise the interface of the service with the container, and contain service metadata, such as a codeCommandcode for the service, data on who may use the service, etc.p  pAm I heading in the right direction, and if so, how do I store and expose codeIBusinessAreacode and codeIServicecode metadata as classes, versus legions of untyped metadata attributesp

OnLostFocus call my delegate and OnGotFocus reset the error statep  precodepublic class MyTextBox  TextBox      public delegate void ValidateTextHandlerobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e      public event ValidateTextHandler ValidateText  delegate        public bool HasError              get  return boolGetValueHasErrorProperty          set  SetValueHasErrorProperty, value            public static readonly DependencyProperty HasErrorProperty  DependencyProperty.RegisterHasError, typeofbool, typeofMyTextBox, new  PropertyMetadatafalse, HasErrorChangedCallback      private static void HasErrorChangedCallbackDependencyObject sender,  DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs e              MyTextBox textBox  sender as MyTextBox          textBox.GoToStatetrue           void GoToStatebool useTransitions              if HasError                                      VisualStateManager.GoToStatethis, HasError, useTransitions                                    protected override void OnGotFocusRoutedEventArgs e              HasError  false         base.OnGotFocuse           protected override void OnLostFocusRoutedEventArgs e              ValidateTextthis, e         base.OnLostFocuse       codepre  pSo, thats my textbox.p  pNow in the application I add an instance of a textbox to the form and subscribe to the ValidateText event and in that event just for testing I set the HasError property to true.p  precodeltMyTextBox xNametextTest ValidateTexttextTestValidateText gt  private void textTestValidateTextobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e      textTest.HasError  true          codepre  pSo, now when I run this and the focus is lost from the textbox it is highlighted red which is just what I want. However, if I select the same textbox again and move the focus away again the HasError state isnt applied and the textBox just shows back in its default view. The HasError code is running so I cant understand why the red error color isnt showingp  pAnyway can anybody help I hope it all makes sense.p  pThis is a Windows 8 application using WinRT XAML and C.p

Negative 16268 pI am using codeXamlServicescode as a generalpurpose serialization mechanism, as described a hrefhttpludovic.chabant.comdevblog20080616almosteverythingyouneedtoknowaboutxamlserializationpart1 relnofollowherea, a hrefhttpludovic.chabant.comdevblogtagxaml2 relnofollowherea and a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combburstegarchive20090518xamlinnet40serializationanddeserializationusingxamlservices.aspx relnofollowherea. Although this works very well for most scenarios, I am unclear how to get it to serialize string property values that contain nonprintable characters specifically null characters.p  pHeres a simple example of a class that I might wish to serializep  precodepublic class MyClass      public string Value  get set   codepre  pIf I create an instance of that class note the null character in the assigned property value ...p  precodevar instance  new MyClass      Value  Some0Value,  codepre  p... and serialize it using codeXamlServicescode ...p  precodevar xaml  XamlServices.Saveinstance codepre  p... it throws the exception codehexadecimal value 0x00, is an invalid character.codep  pI guess this indicates that XAML serialization doesnt natively support binary string data, so I am happy to convert the string to an encoded form e.g. Base64 during serialization. p  pI have attempted achieve this conversion by creating a custom XAML value serializer that implements Base64 encoding and applying it to the relevant class properties ... p  precodepublic class MyClass      [ValueSerializertypeofBase64ValueSerializer]     public string Value  get set   codepre  p... but its conversion methods never get invoked, presumably because the XAML serialization mechanism thinks that no custom serializer is required when serializing a string property.p  pSimilarly, I created a custom type converter with the same goal in mind. Once again, its codeConvertTocode method does not get called during serialization although, interestingly, its codeConvertFromcode method does get called during deserialization and correctly populates the target property from Base64encoded string data.p  pI am looking for ideas how to get codeXamlServicescode to obey my custom codeTypeConvertercode or codeValueSerializercode or some other means to coerce my binary string property values into a stringserializable form.p
Negative 16268 pI have a Grails application that takes input from a .csv and makes a SOAP call for each row to add the data to an external system. The process works fine with a smaller data set, say 200 records. However, with a larger data set, the process will be chugging along with no apparent issue, and then a second instance will start and run in parallel to the initial instance. This is causing me to have duplicate entries in the external system. I am not sure exactly what the threshold is where the duplication will occur.p  pIn the past, I had nearly the same problem with a ColdFusion application. That app would take xml input over a web service call, iterate through email recipients in the xml, and send out emails. With 500 recipients in the file, the emails would send out without issue. With 10000 recipients in the file, however, the same duplication issue would sometimes occur where the process would be running and the emails sending, and then a second instance would start up at the beginning of the list and start sending out duplicate emails. p  pSince I have observed the problem in the two different environments that both share java at their foundation, Im thinking the problem is somewhere in the tuning of my java environment. Can someone point me in the right direction as to what I should be looking at in the environment to resolve this issue Or, if you think the issue is somewhere other than the environment, what else should I be looking at I know that code only does what you tell it to do, but I am 100 certain that nothing in the code is telling the process to start a second time in mid process. If there is a problem with the code, it must be something like code that is inducing memory leaks or something along those lines.p

Negative 16268 pIn my multithreading design, task of a thread is running n objects sequentially, which they are appended in a list For example thread iterates on list and calls run method of the objects. After an object completed its task, it must be removed by the thread, it is easy because after invoking run method of an object, thread check whether the object has completed its task or not.Therefore after calling run method of an object, its state is either completed or waiting for an IO operation and during IO the thread deals with other objects.    p  pstrongProblemstrong When thread calling back run method of an object it is going to start run from the first line and the state of machine and variables are initialized and are different from the previous calling run method by the thread where it executes return within run to waiting for an IO.p  pstrongQuestionstrong How can I save the current values of local memory of a thread state of machine and reload it on the current threadp  pI know that I can use more thread to running objects and lock thread during running run until IO operation is completed, but it is not good idea when n is big. Because it has to create large number of thread such that most of them may be all of them are waiting for IO operations. p

Negative 16268 pI dont have much experience with VHDL, so excuse me if its stupid boring question, but I couldnt find appropriate answer. I have code that is a bit simplified here.p  precodeprocess sysclk, reset    begin     if reset  0 then       reseting code     elsif risingedgesysclk then         if dataready  1 and olddataready  0 then  rising edge of asynchronous sig              update few registers, and assigning values to few signals         elsif erroroccured  1 and olderroroccurred  0 then            update few registers, and assigning values to few signals same registers and  signal as above         end if         olddataready lt dataready         olderroroccured lt erroroccured     end if     end process codepre  pSignal is kept much longer high than period of sysclk is, but its not know for how long. It varies. These IFs result in two one each registers and an AND circuit. I believe you know that. This worked, but very badly. The were errors to often. So I made special project using two processes. One active on rising edge of dataready and one on erroroccured. But I could use it just to increment and decrement to separate counters. I used that to verify that problem with my code is that sometimes this rising edge detection does not work. sysclk is 27MHz, and I made much bigger project using that same frequency and they worked well. But there was no detection of rising edge of asynchronous signals this way. So I reduced frequency to 100kHz, because I dont really need higher frequencies. And that solved my problem.p  pBut just for curiosity, what is the best way to test for rising edge of asynchronous signal when few of these signal affect same registers and device needs to work on higher frequencies p  pI use Altera Quartus II and Cyclone II FPGA.p

Ive included a partial with a Ransack search form and if I search, it redirects to a new page the userssearch page created originally. So, if I use codesearchformforcode, Ransack instantly routes to a new path I can manipulate this via codeurlcode.

Its most confusing to me where I shall put the method to return, say, the last draft. In Rails Id make it a class method on the Draft model.

Negative 16268 pIm working with Moodle to embed videos for an online class and Im having trouble with the formats. I want to include close captions on the video and Apple Compressor does not seem to save captions to MP4 files. Therefore, Ive started using .mov files instead of MP4s. Unfortunately, some students seem to have trouble viewing the .mov files. I was wondering if it would be possible to embed the .mov files and have the quicktime player default to the .mp4 if the .mov file didnt work.p  pI know this is possible with HTML5 videos, but unfortunately the current faculty wants to keep using the embedded QuickTime player. Heres what I have so farp  p  pIs it possible to include two srcs somehowp  pThanks so muchp

Negative 16268 pI currently have a simple aspx webform that only has one div used with div id for a chart control. This control is populated with data from a jquery call made in file Dash.js which is included in the aspxs HTML. When the webform loads, the jquery function codeFillGraphRunDatecode is called and the chart is displayed. Currently, I hardcode the parameter so I call codeFillGraph20140603code, which then invokes WCF method which is used as datasource. The following is part of the jquery functionp  precodefunction FillGraphRunDate      ...     dataSource          transport              read                  url httplocalhost50Wcf.svcFillChartDate  RunDate,                 dataType json                           , codepre  pAs you can see, the function call is hardcoded with the date. If I want to change the graphic data, Id have to go to Dash.js and change the date in FillGraph. The JS call looks like thisp  precodefunction FillChart      FillGraph20140603   document.readyFillChart document.bindkendoskinChange, FillChart codepre  pWhat Id like to do is add a textbox and a button to the ASPX. That way, when I click on the button, I take the textbox string and somehow pass it to the jquery call.p  pI didnt post any code because there is none. I just want to know how to send a value from a webform to a jquery function call thats in a separate .JS file. I tried googling it, but I dont think Im searching correctly.p  pThanks.p

Negative 16268 pI have Windows 764 Pro box with Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate, revised to Update 4, with a problem.p  pOver the last week, Ive started experiencing a problem that was originally tolerable, but now has grown worse to a matter of unusability, and Im in need of some any suggestions. It may turn out this is more appropriate over as a Microsoft issue moreso than a purely programming issue, but I thought perhaps someone might have experienced the issue, hence Im taking a shot here.  p  pThe problem The VS2012 IDE, moments after starting, seizes with no solution or project loaded, going into Not Responding mode, never to return. Worse, however, is that when this occurs, it blocks the OS from starting emanyem 32bit processes, and 64bit processes arent exactly responsive. p  pThis had occurred only once or twice in the last week, and thus I assumed it was an oddoneoff situation and didnt think it was a chronic problem. Today became chronic. Whereas over the last few days this symptom was unusual, today it prevented me from working in VS2012 all day. The VS2012 IDE would be responsive for a brief time, then seize up. p  pDoing a bit of research on the nature of the issue, and observing it didnt occur until I started VS2012, I began to realize it must be associated with the native VS executable or the ancillary devenv.exe that starts along with it. The real culprit, however, was the Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.Host.exe executable that provides the web version of the VS hosting environment that was causing the problem. p  pWhen the VS2012 IDE would seize, killing the Web.Host.exe process would immediately free the IDE for a time, and allow any queued 32bit apps to start. However, the symptom would return as soon as the web hosting process restarted. p  pI have updated VS2012 to Update 4, and performed a repair installation of VS2012, and nothing has changed. There are no errors in the event logs that would indicate hardware issues such as a hard drive failure or any other lowerlevelorganic OS issues. Theres really nothing to configure that I know of on the web host process side, so short of a complete reinstall of VS2012, Im not sure what else to try. p  pI saw a fleeting resemblance to this error in a Microsoft Connect forum, but the symptoms were not, in fact, identical, and the prescribed fix VS2012 up to Update 4 was to no avail.p  pstrongEditstrong emMinor bit of additional informationem  the only unusual element that might prove an xfactor in this situation is the recent switch to TFS  within the last week  frighteningly coincident with the onset of the problem. But thinking the SCC provider would be less interested in the emcontentem than supporting things like Intellisense, debugging, and the like, I had a tough time convincing myself it would be a player. At this point, however, who knows.p  pAny suggestions appreciated.p

However, this approach is causing issues with data binding, since my HTML form would need to send two pieces of information for each role the name property and also the type.  Since these roles are listed in a HTML select statement I can only send one piece of information the name.p

Negative 16268 pIm adding a hrefhttpsgithub.comcemerickfriend relnofollowFrienda to my Compojure app for authentication.  Im using codeworkflowsinteractiveformcode.  I have a form that lets me register a new user JS POST to coderegistercode, and I have a form that lets me log in JS POST to codelogincode, and they both work great so far.p  pI want new user registration to also log in the user, naturally.  Is there an easy way to say this user is now loggedin on the server sidep  pThe client side AJAX call to coderegistercode has the username and password, so I could simply have it reencode the form data in the way that codelogincode expects, and submit a second AJAX request for the log in.  That seems awkward, though.p  pI think that this might have something to do with codeworkflowscode but that part of the documentation is a bit puzzling to me.p

Negative 16268 pI am setting up a very simple HTTP server for the first time, am considering my options, and would appreciate any feedback on the best way to proceed. My goal is pretty simple Im not serving any files, I only need to respond to a very specific HTTP POST request that will contain geolocation data, run some Python code, and return the results as JSON. I do need to be able to respond to multiple simultaneous requests. I would like to use HTTPS.p  pIn looking on stackoverflow it seems I can potentially go with BaseHTTPServer and ThreadingMixIn, or Apache and modwsgi. I already have Apache installed, but have never configured it. Are there compelling reasons to go the more complicated Apache route more complicated to me, because I will need to do research on configuring Apache and getting modwsgi going but already have a test instance of BaseHTTPServer up and running, or is it equally safe, secure very important, and performanceoriented to use BaseHTTPServer for something so simple p

Negative 16268 pGone through all the links on google and on here and a lot didnt have answers to them. I have an app that has a MainStoryboard.storyboard and a MainStoryboardiPad.storyboard. The iPad storyboard opens fine. The MainStoryboard.storyboard throws the following error when I click on it in Xcode Interface Builder was unable to determine the type of MainStoryboard.storyboard. I cannot view or change the storyboard and it prevents the app from building. The build error is The operation couldnt be completed. com.apple.InterfaceBuilder error 2001.p  pSo heres what has happened on my end that Im aware of in the past week. I was on Mavericks and the app built and ran just fine. I am in the middle of a move so I have not touched anything is 6 days. Today I installed Yosemite and upgraded Xcode to 6.1. I launched Xcode selected my storyboard, and these errors occurred. p  pI checked that the correct storyboard was chosen in build settings and it is.p  pI tried to rename the storyboard and duplicate it and that of course hasnt worked. Im not sure if I screwed something up a week ago when I was working on it or if the upgrade to Yosemite messed something up or what. Ive looked online and havent really found any help. Other than reading the errors it throws, Im not really sure what else to check either. p  pIf anyone has help or has knows of things I can check to help further diagnose the issue Id greatly appreciate it.p  pHeres screenshots of the errors. a hrefhttpi62.tinypic.com21r02p.pnghttpi62.tinypic.com21r02p.pnga a hrefhttpi60.tinypic.com2r4txsw.pnghttpi60.tinypic.com2r4txsw.pngap  pP.S. I should mention Im looking for solutions that dont require me to recreate the entire thing again. I could do that, but I am hoping that I can find a solution that wont be as time consuming.

Negative 16268 pFor a project of mine no, not a homework or exam problem, though I think it would make a good one, I am in need of an algorithm.  The problem seems familiar and general enough that Im pretty confident it has been solved in the literature, but I do not have my algorithms books handy and it is not clear what terms would be used to describe it, so googling is of limited use.p  pStripped of extraneous detail, the problem is as follows  You are given a set of resources  R1, R2, ... Rn and a set of tasks T1, T2, ... Tm.  Each task can be accomplished using any one of alternative sets of resources TRm    R1m1, R1m2, ... ,  R2m1, R2m2, ... , ... .  Each resource can only be used by one task at a time.  The problem is to see if all tasks can be fulfilled at the same time or, if that is not possible, what the largest number of tasks starting at T1 can be fulfilled simultaneously.p  pA naive algorithm which just assigns each task the first set of available resources is bound to fail unnecessarily sometimes Think of TR1    R1, R2 ,  R1   and TR2    R1 ,  R2  .  T1 would grab R1 and R2 and T2 would fail, while TR1 could have just taken R1 and TR2 could have taken R2.p  pI am looking for an algorithm, preferably elegant and simple, that would do a better job.p  pIn so far as it matters, the resources largely consist out of interchangeable subsets and tasks usually require just one or more resources from each set, so the naive algorithm usually succeeds, but that will not always be case.p  pMoreover, there are usually less than a dozen tasks and resources and the problem coded currently in Python 3 is not realtime, so bruteforce would generally be an acceptable solution, but I am looking for something better.p  pAny suggestions or linksp

Negative 16268 pstrongWhat Im trying to dostrongp  pWithin Android, Ive attempted to use SharedPreferences to store usernames within application memory. So users dont need to input their usernames everytime, but the app wont decrypt usernames. Without encryption it stores and returns usernames, but with AES128 encryption usernames not decryptedreturned.p  pstrongWhats happeningstrongp  pThe program stores newly encrypted usernames in memory, but when the application attempts to decrypt them, nothing happens username textbox is returned empty.p  pstrongWhat the application was intended to do but isnt doingstrongp  pThe user should input their username and password and if they click on the Remember checkbox, upon press of the login button the application stores and then encrypts their username. p  pUpon future running of the app, if the checkbox was previously checked their username would already appear typed in the username textbox. When the button function is complete, the application is then restarted by the doSomethinghElse subroutine, so to confirm to me that the app had worked and the unencrypted username has been returned.  emBut this isnt happening right nowemp  pstrongActual Problemstrongp  pIts not decrypting and returning usernames.

Negative 16268 pIm trying to determine why I receive the strongORA00942 table or view does not existstrong error when running a script.  The script should check to see if the table has been created, if not create it for later use within the script and continue running.

Additionally, any checks or queries against the cctemp table will fail because it doesnt exist.p  pThe script is being run as SYSTEM currently.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11272904ddlstatementsinplsqlDDL statements in PLSQLa explains why the issue is occuring, but I dont understand how to get around it.

For some reason the SecurityStamp verification is not implemented in Webapi application created from template in VS 2013. I thought this should have been done by default.p  pTo verify the SecurityStamp validation concept I have changed SecurityStamp in the database and after that called some webapi method from client using old bearer token, i.e. containing old SecurityStamp claim. Please note my webapi controller is annotated with [Authorize] attribute. After that ValidateIdentityOAuthValidateIdentityContext context method has been called and context.Rejected line has been executed and I was expecting the webapi method should not be called after that and the 401 Unauthorized response should be send back to the client.p  pBut nothing of this happened. Webapi method did get called and the client did successfully get sensitive data from server whereas should not, because the old bearer token the client sent to the server for authentication and authorization must not be valid after password change.p  pI thought if context.Rejected have been called in ValidateIdentity method any [Authorize] decorated webapi method should not be called and the  client should receive something like 401 Unauthorized response.p  pAm I misunderstanding the whole thing If I am could anyone explain how it works, please Why after context.Rejected has been called the [Authorize] annotated controllers webapi method gets called and successfully returns sensitive data Why the 401 Unauthorized response has not been sent instead How to achieve the goal which is the 401 Unauthorized response to be sent back to the client when SecurityStamp claim is not the same as in the database currentlyp

Two important facts p  p1 Were using EF 6 with Lazy Loading as suggested by the virtual keywords.p  p2 Since every book is tracked individually the number of Book entries in the database will become great quickly. The table will likely have a size of hundreds of millions on the long run. We will perhaps be adding up to 100,000 books per day.p  pThe opinion I supported is that the current implementation is fine and that were not going to run into problems. My understanding is that a SQL statement would be generated to filter the collection when GetEnumerator is called.p  pThe other suggestion made by my coworker is to cache the number of books. That means updating a field int ComputedNumberOfBooks whenever the AddBookToStock or SellBook methods would be called. This field would need to be repeated and updated in both the Store and Corporation classes. Then of course we would need to take care of concurrencyp  pI know adding these fields wouldnt be a big deal, but I really feel bad about this idea. To me it looks like preengineering a problem that doesnt exist, and that in my opinion wont exist.p  pI decided to check again my claims with SO and found 2 contradicting answers p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6309151arenavigationpropertiesreadeachtimetheyareaccessedef41One saying that the whole Books collection would be pulled to memorya, since ICollection only inherits from IEnumerable. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20342174entityframeworkfilteringnavigationpropertiesThe other saying the opposite  the navigation property will be treated as an IQueryable until it is evaluateda.Why not since the property is wrapped by a proxy p  pSo here are my questions  p  p1 What is the truth p  p2 Even if the whole collection is referenced, dont you think that its not a big deal since it would be an IEnumerable low memory usage.p  p3 What do you think of the memory consumption  performance hit on this example, and what would be the best way to go      p  pThank youp

Negative 16268 pI have a java code, that should be read by multiple agents, which were created by the JADE platform. Each agent has his own thread of execution.  Therefore, all my agents run my java code concurrently, but not simultaneously. Ive tried using the Class CyclicBarrier from java API, that should  create a barrier in a way that all the agents threads get together when passing trough this barrier, but this class does not work for agents threads, just for java threads. Does anybody know a way of synchronizing those agents threads Any suggestionsp

Negative 16268 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pYesterday I built a hrefhttpcaffe.berkeleyvision.orginstallation.html relnofollowCaffea and had no problems with its dependencies.p  pToday I had problems building the Caffe Matlab wrappers due to protobuf dependencies not being found. So I rebuilt Caffe codemake cleancode followed by a codemake allcode, hoping that would fix the problem.p  pNow the Caffe build is complaining about the protobuf dependency.p  pThe error output is given at the bottom of this question.p  pBetween the original successful build and the failed build, I needed to codepip install protobufcode to allow the Caffe python wrappers to import protobuf, as python complained about not being able to find the protobuf package. That was the only change involving protobuf prior to the failed Caffe rebuild.p  pI have tried reinstalling protobuf using brew, but this did not help.p  pSo essentially the chronology of events relating to protobuf are as followsp  precode1. protobuf installed from source using brew      brew install buildfromsource withpython fresh vd protobuf 2. caffe built successfully   3. caffe python wrappers failed to build  protobuf not found 4. pip install protobuf 5. caffe python wrappers built successfully 6. caffe matlab wrappers failed to build  protobuf not found 7. tried to rebuild caffe

Negative 16268 pI am trying to create a spider via scrapy to crawl a website and extract all links for specific stores. Ultimately, the spider would then use those store links to extract pricing information. The site is designed to break down store information into States and Regions. I have been able to extract all sub links for the Statesregions, but I cannot seem to extract the specific information for the stores, that information being the store links. p  pI thought it had to do with the page not being loaded long enough for those store links to display. So I used selenium and delayed the timing by 20 seconds to allow appropriate time for the webpage to load. An example link would be a hrefhttpsweedmaps.comdispensariesinunitedstatescolorado relnofollowhttpsweedmaps.comdispensariesinunitedstatescoloradoa and as you can see on the left hand side there is information for specific stores.

Negative 16268 pI have been following this tutorial to implement dynamic cell height.  a hrefhttpwww.raywenderlich.com73602dynamictableviewcellheightautolayoutcomments relnofollowdynamictableviewcellheighta But it only works in ios 7 for me and not in ios 8. However it does work in ios 8 on the iPAD so Im a little stumped why it doesnt work on the iphone.   Whilst I have followed the code pretty exactly there are a couple of differences between the tutorial and the way I have implemented it and as I dont know enough about autolayout and tables Im not sure if this is what is causing my problem.p  pFirstly on the tutorial the tableView has trailing and leading edges exactly equal to 0 to the superview.  In my implementation I have created proportional constraints so that I scale the tableView within multiple different layouts.  To explain further p  pHere is a picture of my TableView using proportional constraints across multiple different devices. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWX2sh.png altenter image description herep  pTo achieve this I implemented the following constraints  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSo2QB.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDKIv1.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkopMK.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8lQ22.png altenter image description herep  pIs it possible that the cell height cannot be calculated by AutoLayout because the tableView has a dynamic height p  pThe second difference that I can see between my implementation and the tutorial is the data source.  I am taking my data from a call to an SLQ3Lite database whereas the tutorial is taking its data from an xml feed.  I am confident that the data is populating the cells because when I look at my implementation on an IPAD I can see the data like so img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comU5NIm.png altenter image description herep  pBut on an iphone this is what appears The table is visible but no cells have been written to the table.  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4X9rP.png altenter image description herep  pWhen I use the debugger I can see that records are being successfully retrieved from the database, but they are not being written to the table. p  pHere is the code which is very long Sorryp  precode    import

Negative 16268 pIm fairly new to Access and am trying to convert what was a previously poorly managed database to a slightly better working version.p  pThe biggest issue is that the database contains several main tables that all have the same primary key. I know thats not ideal but in this case, Im not sure its avoidable as it needs to be this way for privacy concerns  theres a lot of different fields so Im not sure if wed approach the cap.p  pBasically, the database is to house records for surgeries for later research purposes. There are two major primary keys. Several tables for instance, OperativeData  Complications use a Surgery ID as a primary key. Other tables for instance, PatientDemographic  MedicalHistory use a Patient ID as a primary key. There are 9 such main tables in the database.p  pI have two major issues Im trying to solve p  p1 Making sure things will always match up across tables. If we were to create a query wanting to integrate patients medical history and their complications.. I obviously need everything to line up. I also need to be able to update from queriesforms as we dont want everyone to have access to the underlying tables.p  p2 I want to create an easy way to add a record to ALL tables at once. Ideally, this would be a form where I can put in a patient , surgery  and some other basic information. It would create an entry on EVERY table even if none of the other info would be populated yet. One person inputs new patients into the database regularly but it may be years before the other info is put in as it may not be currently part of a research project. p  pHow exactly can I go about solving these two issues p  pMy current attempt at a solution has a Master Table setup. This table has a primary key of Surgery  and a foreign key of Patient  because surgery  will always be unique but a given patient may have multiple surgeries. Using this table as a link, I made a relationship between all of the other tables. Each table with the same primary key linked to eachother as onetoone and then every table also linked to this master table. p  pThis helps things line up when Im doing queries but Im running into a lot of issues when trying to update from a query recordset is not updateable, probably because its onetomany relationships.. but doesnt solve the data entry problem. I read about using a subform but it sounds like I would need a subform for each of my main tables p  pHopefully Ive laid out the issues clearly but please let me know if you have any questions. I obviously cant upload the database itself but I can try to get a similarly constructed database with sample data if it helps.p  pThank you in advance for any help or tips you can providep

Negative 16268 pIm using cordova with Ionic and calabashandroid for automated tests. In old projects Cordova was using org.apache.cordova.CordovaWebView as webview. This is what calabashandroid supports. In newer project Cordova uses org.apache.cordova.engine.SystemWebView as webview which confuse Calabash. Is there a way to switch a newer project to the old webview I only need this until calabash for Android has catched up.p  pOld projects which where the platform was added before the change do stil use CordovaWebView so it feels like this should be possible but I havent find a way to do it.p  pCheers Pascalp
Negative 16268 pCouldnt tell if this was to be in Superuser of Stackoverflow. Heres my guessp  pGetting straight to the point, what are some programming languages that would be able to simplistically not a hrefhttpcodegolf.stackexchange.comgolfstandardsa, necessarily be able to produce a program that, when run, would provide no UI initially. Though, a UI could be enabled at the press or more specifically hold of a button, without the standard minimizerestoredownclose Windows interfacep  pI have practically just provided my intentions for the program  to be able to produce the above. I understand that as each condition is added a programming language is not necessarily eliminated from the languagepool, however I am curious as for what languages would be able to do this. C C Java Python etc. etc.p  pI am running Window 7, and am not a master in any language. I have simply played around with, and learned the syntax and simple controls for a small selection of languages.p

Negative 16268 blockquote   pCSC error CS0006 Metadata file   CBuildAgentworkcbcbc45410f50008OutputbinReleaseabc.xyz.dll   could not be found.p blockquote  pOn a teamcity build that worked fine until now, the build starts intermittently failing for the CS0006 error. p  pI see a lot of posts about the projects build ordering related cause for this issue. But I doubt if this one is related to build orders as I see that they are set right. Also the build configuration and platforms are mentioned right in the project file and on invocation of the msbuild. Moreover the abc.xyz.dll exists on the file system with a creation time earlier than the failure time.p  pI have a feeling that it is some CPU or thread race condition. I say this because when it was consistently failing, I added file access auditing on the dll file, as the build was running. But then this time the build would succeed. I thought I was loading the processor differently by doing some work on the same agent.p  pI believe I am not alone. Thanks for any answers or directions.p

Negative 16268 pIm working on an embedded Linux system 3.12.something, and our application, after some random amount of time, starts hogging the CPU.

However, I now need to figure out how to identify the place in the code thats trying to get this mutex. How can I do that Our code is compiled with GCC and has debugging symbols in it.p  pMy current thinking that I havent tried yet is to print out a string to stdout and flush before trying to grab any mutex in our system, with the expectation that the string will print right before strace complains about getting the lock ... but there are a LOT of places in the code that would have to be instrumented like this.p  pEDIT Another strange thing that I just realized is that our program doesnt start hogging the CPU until some random time has passed since it was run 5 minutes to 5 hours and anywhere in between. During that time, there are emzeroem codefutexcode syscalls happening. Why do they suddenly start From what Ive read, I think maybe they are being used properly in userspace until something fails and falls back to making a codefutexcode syscall...p  pAny suggestionsp
