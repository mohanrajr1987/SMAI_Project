Positive 14 pI am trying to learn LispScheme and I tried implementing a very simple version of the mandelbrot set in it to get practice. The problem I ran into is that the code runs very, very slow. At first I thought it was because I was using recursion instead of imperative loops, but I tried rewriting more or less the same code recursion included in python which doesnt even have tailcall optimisation, and it ran very smoothp  pSo I am wondering if there is something obvious I am missing in my code and what I could do to make it run faster.p  pHere is the code snippet in Scheme racket. I also did pretty much the same thing in SBCL and the speed was comparablep  precodelang racket  definesyntax dotimes     syntaxrules         var n res . body        do limit n             var 0  var 1            gt var limit res          . body        var n . body        do limit n             var 0  var 1            gt var limit          . body  define printbrot zr zc   if lt   zr zr  zc zc 2       display        display .  define brot zr zc cr cc i   if  i 0       printbrot zr zc       let z2r   zr zr  zc zc z2c  2 zr zc         brot  z2r cr  z2c cc cr cc  i 1  define linspace i w     i  w 2  w 4  define brotgrid w h n   dotimes i w            dotimes j h                     let x linspace i w y linspace j h                       brot 0 0 x y n            newline  brotgrid 40 80 20 codepre  pI hope the code block is not too clustery, it was hard to strip it to something more simplep  pAlso, I know Scheme and Common Lisp have complex numbers built in but I wanted to test it using regular real numbers, I dont think this is the reason it runs so slow.p  pThe parameter i of the brot function is the number of iterations, and the parameter n of brotgrid is also the number of iterations to use for each point. When I set it to more than like 10, the code takes forever to run, which doesnt seem normal. The increase in time taken also doesnt seem to be linear, for instance it only takes about a second on my machine with n  10 but takes several minutes with n  15 and doesnt even finish with n  20p  pSo, what is it that makes this code run so slowp  pThanks in advancep

Positive 14 pIf I try to evaluate the expression codeexpt 123456 123456code in both Chicken Scheme with the numbers extension and Clisp it takes quite a long time more in Clisp. So I thought that evaluating the expression code expt 123456 123456 expt 123456 123456code would take at least double that time, because the interpreter has to evaluate twice the power function and then has to evaluate a division.

Its the fourth that confuses me. Why doesnt it return QUOTE 1 2 3p  pI realise that if you enter QUOTE 1 2 3 into the REPL, you get 1 2 3 back, so the expression are equivalent in that sense. But LIST 1 2 3 is equivalent to 1 2 3, and yet the first expression doesnt return that.p  pIt seems inconsitent that list quote 1 2 3 returns a list with the first item being a quote symbol, but list quote 1 2 3 returns a quoted list. Especially since expressions like list list ... seem to always return a list beginning with the symbol  so far, at least, quote is the only special case like this.p  pIts not the easiest question to articulate, so Im hoping Ive managed to get my confusion across. Can anyone explain why quote gets treated in this seeminglyunique wayp
Positive 14 pIm writing a program in Common Lisp for editing binary files generated by Minecraft that use the NBT format, documented here a hrefhttpminecraft.gamepedia.comNBTformatcookieSetuptruehttpminecraft.gamepedia.comNBTformatcookieSetuptruea Im aware that such tools exist, such as NBTEditor and MCEdit, but neither are written in Common Lisp, and I thought this project would make an excellent learning exercise.p  pSo far one of the only things that I havent managed to implement on my own is a function for reading a UTF8 string of known length that contains characters that are represented using more than one octet i.e. nonASCII characters. In the NBT format, every string is UTF8 encoded and is preceded by a short two octet integer codencode denoting the strings length. So, assuming that only ASCII characters are present in the string, I can simply read a sequence of codencode octets from the stream and convert it to a string using like sop  precodedefun readutf8string stringlength bytestream   let seq makearray stringlength elementtype unsignedbyte 8                                        fillpointer t     setf fillpointer seq readsequence seq bytestream     flexistreamsoctetstostring seq externalformat utf8 codepre  pBut if one or more of the characters has a character code greater than 255, it is encoded in two or more bytes, as seen in this examplep  precodeflexistreamsstringtooctets wife externalformat utf8 gt 119 105 102 101  flexistreamsstringtooctets  externalformat utf8 gt 208 182 208 181 208 189 208 176 codepre  pBoth strings have the same length, but each character of the Russian word is encoded in double the number of octets, so the total size of the string is double that of the English one. So knowing the string length does not help if using readsequence. Even if the size of the string i.e. the number of octets needed to encode it was known, there would still be no way of knowing which of those octets to convert to character form individually and which to group together for conversion. So instead of rolling my own function, I tried to find a way to get either the implementation Clozure CL or an external library do the work for me. Unfortunately this too has been problematic, because my parser relies on using the same file stream for all reading functions, like thisp  precodewithopenfile stream test.dat direction input                                    elementtype unsignedbyte 8   Read entire contents of NBT file from stream here codepre  pwhich limits me to the codeelementtype unsignedbyte 8code and therefore prohibits me from specifying a character encoding and using readchar or equivalent like thisp  precodewithopenfile stream test.dat externalformat utf8   ... codepre  pThe codeelementtypecode has to be codeunsignedbyte 8code so that I can read and write integers and floats of various sizes. To avoid having to manually convert sequences of octets to strings, I first wondered whether there was a way to change the element type to that of a character while the file is open, which led me to this discussion here a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumsearchincomp.lang.lispbinaryhttpsgroups.google.comforumsearchincomp.lang.lispbinarya20write20readcomp.lang.lispN0IESNPSPCUQmcvtk0HkC0J Apparently some CL implementations such as SBCL use bivalent streams by default, so both readbyte and readchar can be used on the same stream if I were to take this approach, I would still need to be able to specify an codeexternalformatcodeto the stream codeutf8code, although this format should only apply when reading characters, and not when reading raw bytes.p  pI have used a couple of functions from flexistreams in the above examples for brevitys sake, but as yet my code uses only the builtin stream types, and I have yet to use flexistreams themselves. strongIs this problem a good candidate for flexistreams Having an additional layer of abstraction that would allow me to read raw bytes and UTF8 characters interchangeably from the same stream would be ideal.strongp  pAny advice from those familiar with flexistreams or other relevant approaches would be very much appreciated.p  pThank you.p

Positive 14 pThere are lots of delightful opinions about macros in Lisp, but I really cannot find a primer I can use in my every day workflow. Im web developer, but use emacs for about 10 years. And I want to understand if macros are really useful for everyone, or it is just killer feature for very specific tasks.p  pMost of the primers using macros are tryings of making DSL on top of the lisp. Well it can be useful sometimes, but creating syntax extensions in commercial development is a bad practice as far as I understand. Most of languages has standard features like for, if, while, foreach operators, common conceptions like classes, namespaces, modules, closureslambdas. So all programs are typically built from such pieces, and new programmer examining your code already knows that pieces and can operate them. And in case of DSL built upon macros, the programmer needs not only to explore business logic, but also learn your DSL. Commercial development gravities to typical solutions with easy support and high replaceability of programmers.p  pNext  creating template engines on top of the macros. Well, the industry standard now is Twig, Jinja2, Template Toolkit  you can create your own template system, but... It is 2015 now, not 2001 when Paul Grahams Viaweb was created. Modern templating systems are very similar to each other  they was developed for years and they have lots of conceptions like blocks, filters, inheritance, i18n. So in 2001 creating own templating engine had sense, but now there complex templating engines for all suddens of life.p  pNext  using macros to create algorithms independent on data passed to them. This conception makes sense, but does it really need macros For example most of scripting languages support of passing functions by reference  that means you can create abstract function which will accept data and dataprocessing function as arguments. Of course you will need to create few dataprocessing functions to support all needed data types, but you will be able to pass all those ones to abstract function which will be short as comparable lisp macro.p  pNext  algorithms itself. Nowadays 90 of us, webdevelopers, are just using ready libraries and algorithms. So even if Im totally wrong in previous paragraph, the role of macros is very small in our job.p  pSo do you really use macros everyday, or you just arely shoot some problem with macros very elegantly and extrapolate that hapinees on next few monthesp

Negative 14 pIn one of my applications, I am querying active directory to get a list of all users below a given user using the Direct Reports thing. So basically, given the name of the person, it is looked up in AD, then the Direct Reports are read.

Or, more abstract The Tool will use a person as the root of the tree and then walk down the complete tree to get the names of all the leaves can be several hundredp  pNow, my concern is obviously performance, as this needs to be done quite a few times.

Negative 14 pIs there a way to modify existing .NET assemblies without resorting to 3rd party tools I know that a hrefhttpwww.postsharp.org relnofollowPostSharpa makes this possible but I find it incredibly wasteful that the developler of PostSharp basically had to rewrite the functionality of the whole codeSystem.Reflectioncode namespace in order to make existing assemblies modifiable.p  pcodeSystem.Reflection.Emitcode only allows the creation of new, dynamic assemblies. However, all the builder classes used here inherit from the basic reflection classes e.g. codeTypeBuildercode inherits from codeSystem.Typecode. Unfortunately, there doesnt seem to be a way to coerce an existing, dynamically loaded type into a type builder. At least, theres no official, supported way.p  pSo what about unsupported Does anyone know of backdoors that allow to load existing assemblies or types into such builder classesp  pMind, I am strongnotstrong searching for ways to modify the current assembly this emmayem even be an unreasonable request but just to modify existing assemblies loaded from disc. I fear theres no such thing but Id like to ask anyway.p  pIn the worst case, one would have to resort to codeildasm.execode to disassemble the code and then to codeilasm.execode for reassembly but theres no toolchain read IL reader contained in .NET to work with IL data or is there.p  pEDITp  pIve got no specific use case. Im just interested in a generalpurpose solution because patching existing assemblies is a quite common task. Take obfuscators for example, or profilers, or AOP libraries yes, the latter emcanem be implemented differently. As Ive said, it seems incredibly wasteful to be forced to rewrite large parts of the already existing infrastructure in codeSystem.Reflectioncode.p  hr  h2Wedgeh2  pYoure right. However, theres no specific use case here. Ive modified the original question to reflect this. My interest was sparked by another question where the asker wanted to know how he could inject the instructions codepopcode and coderetcode at the end of every method in order to keep Lutz Roeders Reflector from reengineering the VB or C source code.p  pNow, this scenario can be realized with a number of tools, e.g. PostSharp mentioned above and the a hrefhttpsebastien.lebreton.free.frreflexil relnofollowReflexila plugin for Reflector, that, in turn, uses the a hrefhttpwww.monoproject.comCecil relnofollowCecila library.p  pAll in all, Im just not satisfied with the .NET framework.p  h2Joelh2  pYes, Im aware of this limitation. Thanks anyway for pointing it out, since its important.p  h2marxidadh2  pThis seems like the only feasible approach. However, this would mean that youd still have to recreate the complete assembly using the builder classes, right I.e. youd have to walk over the whole assembly manually.p  pHmm, Ill look into that.p

Negative 14 pJust trying to gather thoughts on what worksdoesnt work for manipulating BusinessDomain objects through an ASP.NET 2.0 UIPresentation layer.  Specifically in classic ASP.NET LOB application situations where the ASP.NET code talks directly to the business layer.  I come across this type of design quite often and wondering what is the ideal solution i.e. implementing a specific pattern and what is the best pragmatic solution that wont require a complete rewrite where no pattern is implemented.p  pHere is a sample scenario.p  pA single ASP.NET page that is the EditNew page for a particular BusinessDomain object, lets use Person as an example.  We want to edit Name and Address information from within this page.  As the user is making edits or entering data, there are some situations where the form should postback to refresh itself.  For example, when editing their Address, they select a Country.  After which a StateRegion dropdown becomes enabled and refreshed with relevant information for the selected country.  This is essentially business logic restricting available selections based on some dependent field and this logic is handled by the business layer remember this is just one example, there are lots of business situations where the logic is more complex during the post back  for example insurance industry when selecting certain things dictates what other data is neededrequired.p  pIdeally this logic is stored only in the BusinessDomain object i.e. not having the logic duplicated in the ASP.NET code.  To accomplish this, I believe the BusinessDomain object would need to be reinitialized and have its state set based on current UI values on each postback.p  pFor examplep  precodeprivate Person person  null  protected void PageLoad      person  PersonRepository.LoadRequest.QueryString[id]      if Page.IsPostBack         SetPersonStateFromUIperson     else         SetUIStateFromPersonperson   protected void CountryDropDownListOnChange      this.StateRegionDropDownList.Enabled  true     this.StateRegionDropDownList.Items.Clear     this.StateRegionDropDownList.DataSource  person.AvailableStateRegions     this.StateRegionDropDownList.DataBind  codepre  pOther options I have seen are storing the Business object in SessionState rather than loading it from the repository aka database each time the page loads back up.p  pThoughtsp
Negative 14 pIm tasked with implementing a messaging system for a realtime simulation.  There are several different kinds of messaging objects that need to exist in this system, and more might be added in the future.  These objects represent the primary means of communication between the players in the sim.  Assuming I fully understand my requirements, the messaging objects can be defined by the following attributesp  ul liSend protocol what messages a player can send and whenli liReceive protocol what messages a player can receive and how oftenli liMessage format structure of the data being sentli ul  pThe simulation code currently only supports one send and receive protocol and one message format.  My job is to make the code more extensible so it can support future changesadditions to protocols and message structure.  A firstcut approach to this would be to define abstract base classes for each of the attributes and have each messaging object be composed of handles to them.  Every messaging object can then be written as different combinations of protocol and format objects.  My concern is that this design can quickly become overgeneralized and thus a maintenance nightmare.  I cringe at the thought of sifting through a dozen files just to figure out how the heck a codeFooMessagingcode really works.p  pIll be writing this in C, but I think this is really more a general design question.  Are there any standard patterns or best practices I can apply herep

Negative 14 pIm running Windows Server 2003 on a 64bit Itanium server which is also running 64bit Oracle 10.2, and Id like to install cxOracle for Python 2.5.  Ive used cxOracle before many times on both Windows and Linux, and Ive also compiled it before on 32 bit versions of those platforms, but Ive never tried an IA64 compile.p  pNone of the binary builds of cxOracle at a hrefhttpcxoracle.sourceforge.net relnofollowhttpcxoracle.sourceforge.neta are 64 bit, and I get an error after installing any of them when trying to run codeimport cxOraclecode so I figure the thing to do is to compile it from source.p  pWhen running codepython setup.py buildcode then I get the error that Python was built with Visual Studio 2003 and that I need something which can produce compatible binaries.  I have Visual Studio 2005, which apparently doesnt fit the bill due to linking against a different version of the C standard library, and probably for other reasons as well.  Unfortunately, Visual Studio 2003 is no longer available for download, and Im not sure where to get it.p  pSo I download MinGW from a hrefhttpsourceforge.netprojectsmingwfiles relnofollowhttpsourceforge.netprojectsmingwfilesa but this is also only available in 32 bit form.  I go ahead and give it a try anyway, but it gives me an error during compilation about one of the Oracle DLLs Im linking against having an invalid file format.p  pAt this point Ive got a lot of options, and Im not sure where to place my effortsp  ol lipI could download the 64 bit MinGW from a hrefhttpsourceforge.netprojectsmingww64 relnofollowhttpsourceforge.netprojectsmingww64a and try using that, except that it only seems to be available as source, so Id have to compile the compiler, probably using Visual Studio 2005.pli lipI could try using an x86 32 bit build of Python and then download the Oracle Instant Client SDK from a hrefhttpwww.oracle.comtechnologysoftwaretechociinstantclienthtdocswinsoft.html relnofollowhttpwww.oracle.comtechnologysoftwaretechociinstantclienthtdocswinsoft.htmla and then use that to build cxOracle.  Id probably have to set my ORACLEHOME to the client so that it didnt try linking against the 64 bit server DLLs, but this seems like it might work.pli lipI could try compiling Python itself from source, using Visual Studio 2005, so that I could then use Visual Studio 2005 to build cxOracle and not worry about binary compatibility issues.  Ive compiled Python from source many times on Linux and never had any problems, so Id like to believe that its just as simple on Windows.pli lipI could try to figure out how to make Visual Studio 2005 link against the right DLLs and thus produce compatible binaries in that manner without needing Visual Studio 2003.  Intuitively it seems like Visual Studio should be able to produce compatible binaries with older versions of itself, but almost all of my compiler experience is with gcc so I dont really know.pli ol  pIm just really not sure where to direct my efforts.  Does anyone have any suggestions about where to go next  I can copypaste some of the specific error messages Ive gotten if that would be helpful.p  pId especially love to hear from anyone whos ever gotten cxOracle to work on a 64 bit Itanium version of Windows  I cant be the first to try this.p

Negative 14 pWell, lets say Im building ActiveMQ based chat application. Its pretty simple. Having only one codeQUEUE.INcode and one codeTOPIC.OUTcode.

Thats all.p  pNow, I wanna cluster it. Dont need something complex. Just run few other identical nodes codeA..Ncode. Basically, client, subscribed to codeAcode node, sends message to codeA.QUEUE.INcode. This message must then appear on all other nodes codeA..N.TOPIC.OUTcode. This could be easily done by simple camel route that reroute all messages comes to codeTOPIC.OUTcode to other nodes, but is there some nice ActiveMQnative way to do so Like some queuetopic shared among several AMQ instancesp
Negative 14 blockquote   pThank you for submitting APPNAMEHERE.    We have reviewed your application and   have determined that it cannot be   posted to the App Store at this time   because it is not using a baseline   stream of 64 kbps for the HTTP Live   Streaming protocol to broadcast   streaming video. HTTP Live Streaming   is required when streaming video feeds   over the cellular network, in order to   have an optimal user experience and   utilize cellular best practices. This   protocol automatically determines   bandwidth available to users and   adjusts the bandwidth appropriately,   even as bandwidth streams change.    This allows you the flexibility to   have as many streams as you like, as   long as 64 kbps is set as the baseline   feed.p blockquote  pThis is what I have gotten from Apple, eventhough I have a 48kbps, 64kbps, 128kbps AND 384kbps stream available.

Negative 14 pI have a tree structure design problem, and i cant think of a way out.p  pi want to have one class Tree containing a generic data, and extend the Tree class with ComplexTree that will contain more methods like Iterate, DoSomthingOnComplex, etc.p  phere is a sample of the code i havep  precodeclass TreeltTDatagt      public TData Data  get set      public ICollectionltTreeltTDatagtgt Children  get private set       public TreeltDatagtTData data                ...           public void IterateActionltTDatagt action               actionData            Children.ForEachx gt x.Iterateaction        class ComplexTreeltTDatagt  TreeltTDatagt      public int ComplexValue1  get set      public int ComplexValue2  get set       public ComplexTreeTData data, int cv1, int cv2          basedata                ...           public void DoComplexStuffOnTree                ... might want to use the base methods here       codepre  pproblem is that for one thing, i cant really expose the collection that holds Tree to anyone that has create ComplexTree and i cant use Iterate for the ComplexTree because i cant use the cv1, cv2 values that belong only to the inheriting tree.p  pis there an obvious solution im missing should i not use inheritance should rewrite all the methodsp  pThanks, Johnp

Negative 14 h1Overviewh1  pIm looking to create a REST API for my application.  The initialprimary purpose will be for consumption by mobile apps iPhone, Android, Symbian, etc.  Ive been looking into different mechanisms for authentication and authorization for webbased APIs by studying other implementations.  Ive got my head wrapped around most of the fundamental concepts but am still looking for guidance in a few areas.  The last thing I want to do is reinvent the wheel, but Im not finding any standard solutions that fits my criteria however my criteria my be misguided so feel free to critique that as well.  Additionally, I want the API to be the same for all platformsapplications consuming it.p  h2oAuthh2  pIll go ahead and throw out my objection to oAuth since I know that will likely be the first solution offered.  For mobile applications or more specifically nonweb applications, it just seems wrong to leave the application to go to a webbrowser for the authentication.  Additionally, there is no way I am aware of for the browser to return the callback to the application especially crossplatform.  I know a couple of apps that do that, but it just feels wrong and gives a break in the application UX.p  h2Requirementsh2  ol liUser enters usernamepassword into application.li liEvery API call is identified by the calling application.li liOverhead is kept to a minimum and the auth aspect is intuitive for developers.li liThe mechanism is secure for both the end user their login credentials are not exposed as well as the developer their application credentials are not exposed.li liIf possible, not require https by no means a hard requirement.li ol  h3My Current Thoughts on Implementationh3  pAn external developer will request an API account.  They will receive an apikey and apisecret.  Every request will require at minimum three parameters.p  ul liapikey  given to developer at regisration li litimestamp  doubles as a unique identifier for each message for a given apikeyli lihash  a hash of the timestamp  the apisecretli ul  pThe apikey is required to identify the application issuing the request.  The timestamp acts similarly to the oauthnonce and avoidsmitigates replay attacks.  The hash ensures that request was actually issued from the owner of the given apikey.p  pFor authenticated requests ones done on the behalf of a user, Im still undecided between going with an accesstoken route or a username and password hash combo.  Either way, at some point a usernamepassword combo will be required.  So when it does, a hash of several pieces of information apikey, apisecret, timestamp  the password would be used.  bId love feedback on this aspect.b  FYI, they would have to hash the password first, since I dont store the passwords in my system without hashing.p  h3Conclusionh3  pFYI, this isnt a request for how to buildstructure the API in general only how to handle the authentication and authorization from solely within an application.p  h3Random ThoughtsBonus Questionsh3  pFor APIs that only require an apikey as part of the request, how do you prevent someone other than the apikey owner from being able to see the apikey since sent in the clear and make excessive requests to push them over usage limits  Maybe Im just over thinking this, but shouldnt there be something to authenticate that a request was verified to the apikey owner  In my case, that was the purpose of the apisecret, it is never showntransmitted without being hashed.p  pSpeaking of hashes, what about md5 vs hmacsha1  Does it really matter when all of the values are hashed with with sufficiently long data ie. apisecretp  pI had been previously considering adding a per userrow salt to my users password hash.  If I were to do that, how could the application be able to create a matching hash without knowing the salt usedp

Negative 14 pI wanted to make a short intro for a video podcast. Being a geeky web developer and not already having access to or knowledge of animation tools, I thought I might take a stab at doing the intro using various html5 techniques. The problem is, how do I turn that into a video clip I can easily drop into iMoviep  pIf I have to, I think this can be accomplished if I only use canvas by exporting a png every frame using getImageData. The only drawback is that Im limited to just canvas. I was hoping to use the whole range of new html5css3svg techniques. I dont need this functionality to work for general web use, just for myself, so Id be happy for anything that requires installation etc. to make it work.p  pIf I have to, I guess I can probably use a video screen capture tool, but I was hoping for a complete open source chain.p  pIn the end, I expect Ill be creating a series of pngs and using ffmpeg to put them together, I was just hoping to figure out a great way of doing this in an automated, open source way.p  pstrongUpdatestrong I just wanted to clarify that what Im basically trying to do is use HTML5 instead of something like flash, but Im not trying to serve it to other people on the internet, I want to convert it to video, and it never needs to leave my computer, which is actually a mac, not a Linux server. If flash can do it, why not html, right That seems to be what people are trying to claim. The problem is, I can take a SWF and convert it to standard video, but how do you do that with javascript or CSS3 animations Obviously a screen capture tool can sort of do the job, but those are usually low frame rate, and cant be run programmatically to my knowledge.p  pThe closest sort of thing I can think of that isnt a screenshot tool would be something like webkit2png, only instead of a single png, it would take 60 pngs per second. At some point, I might actually try to implement exactly that, but I wanted to see if anyone else had something good.p  pstrongExamplestrong So I actually just did an intro using the built in iMovie title cards. a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvCU63gyt3f5wThis is a good examplea of roughly the sort of thing I would like to do. Should actually be fairly straightforward with a little CSS3 animation work. What I have isnt bad, but I would like to use custom graphics, with better fontlayout control.p

Negative 14 pIm using C, MSHTML and InternetExplorer objects to run through a webpage, but Im snagged on an issue.p  pBasically, Ive noticed that in IE7 or earlier, when window.showModalDialog is called, then the NewWindow3 event is triggered.p  pIn IE8 and IE9, NewWindow3 is never triggered. As MSDN writes The NewWindow3 event is only fired when a new instance of Internet Explorer is about to be created. Calling showModalDialog or showModelessDialog does not trigger an event because they are not new instances of Internet Explorer. They are implemented as MSHTML host windows, which allows them to render and display HTML content but not hyperlinks between documents. httpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa768337vVS.85.aspxp  pThe only way Ive been able to come close to capturing the modal dialog being triggered  but I have no access to the actual modal object  is using the WindowStateChanged event. This event is routinely called, yet Ive noticed that when dwFlags  1 and dwValidFlagsMask3, this is usually when the browser is deactivated due to a modal dialog...p  pNow, all I need to know is how to get that modal dialog object. Any help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 14 h1The Situationh1  pI have a WPF program that I want to print several documents from using some data.  Currently these documents exist as an Excel Spreadsheet and a Word Document.p  h1What I have triedh1  pOpened XPS file Saved as XPS from Excel as a zip and pulled out the Page it only consists of a single page and slapped it into a Window with a grid, just for a test.  OMG  The resources that could not be found and red squiglies every where.  Fonts that are specified in the XPS are represented in a odttf file which WPF does not seem to like.  Renaming it to .ttf doesnt appear to work.  The layout appeared correctly, grid lines and what not, so that is hopeful.p  h1What I really would rather not have to doh1  pRecreate the files as flow document, XPS, or other XAML objects by hand.  The layout is pretty involved for the Excel Spreadsheet document.  The Word doc is not so bad.p  pSo really I just need to know  From the two inputs that I am using Word Document, Excel Spreadsheet how best would I get these into a format that I could easily print from WPF.  Currently I have some code snippets that would allow me to open Excel, open the spreadsheet, put the data into the specified cells, print, issue a close command, check that the program unload and kill it if necessary.  I dont want to do that anymore though.  It is messy and can be buggy as well as requiring the Office Interop assemblies and other stuff to be installed.p

Negative 14 pIm working on a CRM desktop application which is going to be used by more than one agent at a time, and all agents will go through the same list of customers. What I need to do here is to avoid conflicts between agents, so once an agent selects a customer from the list, others shouldnt be able to see that row anymore, or in another words they shouldnt be able to select that customer row until the first agent is done  The simplest way that comes in mind wich may sound stupid is to add two fields LOCKBIT, LOCKEXPIRYDATETIME and manage that. I dont know But I think there should be another way to lock a row for particular session. I searched on Google and I found two InnoDB locking methods but Im not sure if those can help me here in this case.p

Thats the upper end of where Im happy, 10ms would be much better though.p  pIm not sure if I can define a foreground and background color in the style and remove the codefillRectcode call or not, that would speed things up a lot if I could.

Negative 14 pIve written two programs. Now each program uses threading to send and receive packets at the same time.  Whenever I send packets from the server to the client, the message at the client ends gets received in an infinite loop. I.e Ive added a print statement that prints the message sent and this goes forever in an infinite loop. I want to make it so that it receives the message, and then be able to write back to the server and exit whenever the user wants to.p  pIve tried using socket.close, but this makes it so that the client receives the message and I can only write back to the server once. After I send it, I cant send anymore. I want to make it so that I can write back more than once.p  pCan anyone please point me in the right directionp  pMy code is as followsp  precodepublic class UDPThreadClient extends Thread   public static int port1  Create threaded server UDPThreadClient int port1      System.out.println Starting threaded client     start   public void run       int port  port1      try          DatagramSocket serverSocket  new DatagramSocketport1            byte[] receiveData  new byte[1024]            byte[] sendData  new byte[1024]             while true                    DatagramPacket receivePacket  new DatagramPacketreceiveData, receiveData.length                  serverSocket.receivereceivePacket                  String sentence  new String receivePacket.getData                  SocketAddress address  receivePacket.getSocketAddress                    System.out.printlnRECEIVED from   address      sentence                   InetAddress IPAddress  receivePacket.getAddress                  int port  receivePacket.getPort                  String capitalizedSentence  sentence.toUpperCase                  sendData  capitalizedSentence.getBytes                  DatagramPacket sendPacket                   new DatagramPacketsendData, sendData.length, IPAddress, port                  serverSocket.sendsendPacket                  serverSocket.close                    catch IOException e          System.out.println e.getMessage         Create client public static void mainString[] args       int port  Integer.parseIntargs[0]     port1  Integer.parseIntargs[1]     new UDPThreadClient port1     try             BufferedReader inFromUser  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReaderSystem.in            DatagramSocket clientSocket  new DatagramSocket           InetAddress IPAddress  InetAddress.getByNamelocalhost            byte[] sendData  new byte[1024]           byte[] receiveData  new byte[1024]            String sentence  inFromUser.readLine            sendData  sentence.getBytes            DatagramPacket sendPacket  new DatagramPacketsendData, sendData.length, IPAddress, port            clientSocket.sendsendPacket            DatagramPacket receivePacket  new DatagramPacketreceiveData, receiveData.length            clientSocket.receivereceivePacket            String modifiedSentence  new StringreceivePacket.getData            System.out.printlnFROM SERVER  modifiedSentence           clientSocket.close      catch IOException e          System.out.println e.getMessage           codepre  pandp  precodepublic class UDPThreadServer extends Thread   public static int port1  Create threaded client UDPThreadServer        System.out.println Starting threaded server     start     public void run       try          DatagramSocket clientSocket  new DatagramSocket              BufferedReader inFromUser  new BufferedReader new InputStreamReaderSystem.in             Scanner in  new Scanner inFromUser             InetAddress IPAddress  InetAddress.getByNamelocalhost         byte[] sendData  new byte [1024]         byte[] receiveData  new byte [1024]          while in.hasNextLine          String sentence  in.nextLine         inFromUser.readLine         sendData  sentence.getBytes          DatagramPacket sendPacket  new DatagramPacket sendData, sendData.length, IPAddress, port1         clientSocket.sendsendPacket          DatagramPacket receivePacket  new DatagramPacket receiveData, receiveData.length         clientSocket.receive receivePacket          String modSentence  new String receivePacket.getData         System.out.println FROM SERVER   modSentence                  clientSocket.close      catch IOException e          System.out.println e.getMessage         Create server public static void mainString[] args       int port  Integer.parseIntargs[0]     port1  Integer.parseIntargs[1]     new UDPThreadServer      try          DatagramSocket serverSocket  new DatagramSocket port         byte[] receiveData  new byte[1024]         byte[] sendData  new byte[1024]          while true              DatagramPacket receivePacket  new DatagramPacket receiveData, receiveData.length             serverSocket.receivereceivePacket             String sentence  new StringreceivePacket.getData             SocketAddress address  receivePacket.getSocketAddress             System.out.println Received from   address      sentence              InetAddress IPAddress  receivePacket.getAddress             String capSentence  sentence.toUpperCase             sendData  capSentence.getBytes             DatagramPacket sendPacket  new DatagramPacket sendData, sendData.length, IPAddress, port             serverSocket.sendsendPacket             serverSocket.close                catch IOException e          System.out.println e.getMessage         codepre  pThanks.p
Negative 14 pI have a Debian Linux server with two eSATA drives attached to it NTFS, bleh. They are currently mounted fine and have proper fstab entries setup using UUID, not dev locations.p  pIve come to the conclusion that I need to add noauto mount options so that they arent mounted when the server boots to prevent the server from hanging when they arent present. I do plan on taking them on an occasional excursion.p  pHowever, how should I setup an init script to mount them once the system has booted I could do a codemount mountlocationcode, but I would prefer to check for their existence before doing that to prevent an error from being thrown. Also, do I just need to throw this script into the codeetcinit.dcode directory for it to work Im fairly new to Debianp

Negative 14 pI am trying to get CPU usage of various processes cpu ticks from a background application running on iOS4 using Apple SDK. This is done completely with users consents so there is nothing unethical here.p  pI have used sysctl to get process list but the cpu ticks for the process is always returned as 0 from the device. Alternatively, I tried to look for foreground process and polling every few seconds to get application usage that way. However, there is no APIflag which indicates if a process is running in the foreground or background. I event checked for getting memory consumption of a process and to figure out if it was running in the background memory will not fluctuate if in the background. However, the API, procpidinfo, is private and Apple rejected the app. p  pI have seen some posts related to such topics but did not get a definite answer.p  pI am aware sand boxing will not allow to get info on other apps which is, btw, not true since sysctl gives PIDs, process names and start time. However, I saw an application on the appstore called MyLife by Zokem and they report such information. They are accurate to the second. I was wondering if there is a system log or DB which stores this information.p  pAnyone has ideas about getting the usage time of applicationsp

Negative 14 pWe are working on a flex air sync application using the ColdFusion ActionScript ORM Library. Since we have just started with this, I had a basic question. The remote database is a huge one with lot of tables and relation ships and we are implementing a small portion of the functionality for the sync application. Hence we are planning to use some denormalized tables for the local database sqlite.  I just wanted to know whether sync would work when we have denormalized tables locally i.e the local DB and the remote DB are not exactly similar. We are using ColdFusion 9.0.1 ActionScript ORM Library. Also, if this can be done then where have to handle the differences   I suppose on the server cold fusion sidep  pThanks,p

The image turns back into an iframe and the iframe plugin replaces it with its own placeholder Even worse, when the document is saved and reopened for editing, the same thing happens. How can I keep my playbutton placeholder without breaking or replacing the built in iframe plugin placeholder The pagebreak plugin seems to do something similar with div, but Im not sure how CKEditor distinguishes between a pagebreak div and an ordinary div when it puts the fake elements in the editor. Has anyone tried something like this I would prefer to not create a custom HTML element on my website just for this.p

Negative 14 pThat is the most efficient way to perform a left outer join in LINQ if I must do the following...p  ul liFilter Table 2 by a beginning and ending date.li liAll rows in Table 1 must remain, even if the filtering of Table 2 returns no rows.li liThe result must be grouped so that the columns from Table 2 get summed.li ul  pFor example example code variable names changed for propietary reasons, supposed I have a database with two tables.  Table 1 has a list of doors with a building code, door ID and current status open or closed  the building code and door ID are the primary key.  Table 2 has a list of events for all doors an event is an opening or closing plus a timestamp.  So the columns are building code, door ID, timestamp, opening, closing.  Opening and closing are integers with a 1 in the column for the appropriate event.  There is a foreign key relationship between the two tables on the building code and door ID.p  pFor my query I need to return a list of all the unique doors with the current door status and a sum of all the opening and closing events for a selected time period. emAn entry must be returned for each door, even if no events occured during the selected time period.emp  pBelow is the best LINQ code I could come up with.

My plan is replace the PHP insert query with PLSQL insert.p  precodecreate or replace TRIGGER EXTENDCLOB  BEFORE INSERT ON TSESSIONS for each row BEGIN   insert into tsessions id,data,expires values  new.id, new.data, new.expires  END codepre  pThis trigger can work but it will insert 2 records trigger once, PHP once. Is there anyway to ignore the query insert by PHP p

Negative 14 pIm trying to construct a proper destructible terrain, just for research purposes. Well, everything went fine, but resolution is not satisfying me enough. I have seen a lot of examples how people implement MC algorithm, but most of them, as far as I understand, uses functions to triangulate final mesh, which is not  appropriate for me.p  pI will try briefly to explain how Im constructing my terrain, and maybe someone of you will give me suggestion how to improve, or to increase resolution of final terrain.p  h31 Precalculating MC triangles.h3  pIm running simple loop through MC lookup tables for each case0255 and calculating triangles    in rage [0,0,0]  [1,1,1].

Its written in Python. My Python knowledge and Natural Language Processing knowledge come only from teaching myself things through the internet.

The possibilities of POS tagging were also mentioned, but my text may be too fragmentary and strange for an implementation of such to come easy, given my amateurness.p  h1Perhaps I need something like AtD, but hopefully less complexh1  pstrongI think need something that works like a hrefhttpafterthedeadline.comAfter the Deadlineastrong or a hrefhttpqueequeg.sourceforge.netindexe.htmlQueequega, but neither of these seem exactly right. Queequeg is probably not a good fit  it was written in 2003 for Unix and I cant get it working on Windows for the life of me have tried everything. But I like that all it checks for is proper verb conjugation and number agreement.p  pOn the other hand, AtD is much more rigorous, offering more capabilities than I need. But I cant seem to get the a hrefhttpblog.afterthedeadline.com20090915pythonbindingsforatdpython bindingsa for it working. I get 502 errors from the AtD server, which Im sure are easy to fix, but my application is going to be online, and Id rather avoid depending on another server. I cant afford to run an AtD server myself, because the number of services my application is going to require of my web host is already threatening to cause problems in getting this application hosted cheaply.p  h2Things Id like to avoidh2  pstrongBuilding Ngram language models myself doesnt seem right for the task.strong my application throws a lot of unknown vocabulary, skewing all the results.

The index file then parses the uri and includes the requested files. These files also have more than a couple of includes in them, and each may open up a MySQL connection. And then emthoseem files have includes too, which open sql connections. It goes down to about 34 levels.p  pIs this process CPU and memory intensive, both from the PHP includes and opening and closing MySQL connections in each included filep  pAlso, would pretty urls using purely htaccess use less resourcesp

Negative 14 pI have a rails 3.1 application that has a landing page that Id like to cache at the page level.  I understand that there are a number of techniques for this, and the one that is most appealing is to cache the controller index action that represents the landing page.  This page doesnt have any user authentication, and would be the same for all users until the cache is swept.p  pHowever, I have both a mobile layout and a nonmobile layout, with the applicationcontroller detecting the presence of a mobile user agent, and setting an appropriate layout based on the user agent.  Is it possible to use page caching in this case, or am I stuck doing fragment caching to support the two layouts  Alternatively, is there a better strategy for rendering separate mobile content that would make page caching easierp

Being new to iOS development, I dont know if either of these would be valid optionsp  ol liCreate a faded image to use as an overlay on the scrollview so the icons only appear through the visible portion. li liActually change the alpha of the images based on their distance from the center or from each edge.li ol  pI suspect the first idea would be the most simple, but Id like to throw this out there for any other ideas. p  pNote I did see a hrefhttpwww.cocoanetics.com201108addingfadinggradientstouitableview relnofollowthisa tutorial, however that technique assumes that the background is a solid color. If I were to do it programatically, I would probably need to fade the individual images.p
Negative 14 pIm working on a thesis about chord detection. After struggling hard, I found the root of my problem is at getting the amplitude of the wav file using my C based program.p  pI used this codes to retrieve the amplitudep  precodepublic WavProcessingString fileNameWithPath                      fileNameWithPath  fileNameWithPath           public void Initialization                      AssignWaveHeaderData             streamBuffer  File.ReadAllBytesfileNameWithPath             fftBufferSize  16384             fftBufferSize2  fftBufferSize  2           private void getAmplitude                      waveData  new short[numOfSamples]             var xsample  new short[numOfSamples]             var x  0             var str                for var i  44  i lt waveData.Length i  i  2 44 because the wave data          starts at 44th byte.                             waveData[x]  BitConverter.ToInt16streamBuffer,i                x                     codepre  pthe code worked fine at first, I compared it with the delphibased program which is also a chord detection program. But thing I didnt notice is, my code actually only retrieved the half array of amplitudes.p  pFor example I load a Chord C wav file into my C program, the I got the array of amplitudes like thisp  precode[0] 279 [1] 262 [2] 231 [3] 216 [4] 199 [5] 185 [6] 178 [7] 186 [8] 217 [9] 237 [10] 267 [11] 298 [12] 319 [13] 348 [14] 374 [15] 373 [16] 376 [17] 366 [18] 357 [19] 340 [20] 319 [21] 312 [22] 300 [23] 301 [24] 308 [25] 321 [26] 339 ...

Negative 14 pIm having a dilemma. Im working with a lot of legacy code and I see a lot of redundant information in the table structures. Primarily they exist in two formsp  pA. Redundant information to save on joins. egp  precodeeventid, eventname, eventcreatorid        3       test1                43  subeventid, eventid, eventcreatorid           21         3               43 codepre  pNote the duplicacy of the eventcreatorid. The rationale given by the erstwhile senior developers is that when we need the event creator id, we just have to query one table and not do an expensive join to retrieve the value. p  pB. Redundant information to save on calculations. egp  precodeeventid, eventdefaultprice        3                  100  discountid, discountcode, discountpercentage           7,          ABCD,                  50  specialeventid, eventid, discountid, discountedprice               21         3            7,               50 codepre  pNote that instead of calculating the final discountedprice for this special event because the reference to the discountid exists already, the code is saving that calculated value as it is here. Again, the justification is speed, normalcy shot to hell.p  pI have two questionsp  ol liI can tell new developers that these structures are not normalized, but they can say its faster. How do I counter that Do I counter that Do others structure their databases like thisli liIs there a rule of thumb, or a set of principles which I can use to say that  oh, it will be slower, but only by 1, so its okay to do it emthisem way, etcli ol

I found some ideas about implementing codeINotifyPropertyChangedcode interface and I set it up in my custom button like thisp  precodepublic partial class ButtonPin  Button, INotifyPropertyChanged      private ButtonData data      public ButtonData Data              get  return data          set                      if value  data return             data  value             OnPropertyChangedData                   private bool buttonDataAdded       public ButtonPin              InitializeComponent           public ButtonPinButtonData data              Data  data         buttonDataAdded  true           public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged      public void OnPropertyChangedstring propertyName              var handler  PropertyChanged         if handler  null             handlerthis, new PropertyChangedEventArgspropertyName         codepre  pNow I am not sure how to use this For example, if the Color in codeDatacode objects gets changed somehow somewhere and its get assigned to current buttons Data field, I want this button to change its background color. Something likep  precodevar data  new ButtonData data.Name  Hi data.Color  Color.Red  buttonPin1.Data  data Here I need the changes to occur codepre

Negative 14 pJava class files inside jars can be easily replaced and modified.  For instance, the following command can be used to replace a compiled class file within a jarp  precodejar uf JarFile.jar comsomethingClass.class codepre  pIf the class file was replaced with a file such that no dependencies were broken, then the code is still able to execute.  The same happens with class files that are not inside jars.p  pIs there any way to validate a set of class files whether inside a jar or not to see if all their dependencies are present and not brokenp  pI do not want to prevent class files from being modified but rather to be able to verify that changes are valid with respect to dependencies.

Negative 14 pI have a situation where in my web layer, I do a remote EJB lookup and cache the initial context. Now the remote EJB is deployed in a WAS cluster. so if the remote ejb is deployed across server1,server2 and server3 and let us say the first time, the initial context pointing to server1 is cached.  p  pAfter this server1 goes down but other servers are still up. But because the initial context is cached, the ejb calls fail.  p  pNow the simple solution is to remove the cache and do a fresh lookup every time. But that would degrade performance. Is there a way to have the best of both worlds here...reliability and also performancep

Negative 14 pI have a problem with the Autofac ExtensibleActionInvoker interacting with the MVC ModelBinder when using interfaces for parameters. The background is as follows p  pI am building a MVC application and I am using Autofac MVC3s ExtensibleActionInvoker to inject my services as parameters to my actions, e.g.p  precode    public ActionResult Test IMyService service              A new instance of service is created by Autofac ExtensibleActionInvoker          return View      codepre  pThis works really well and makes for a really clean design see a hrefhttpalexmg.compost20100516IntroducingActionInjectionwithAutofacASPNETMVCIntegration.aspx relnofollowAlex MeyerGleaves posta for more information on this approach. I want to use this method as I am producing a code generator to create actions, views, services and DTOs and a peraction service approach makes this easier.p  pHowever I also want to use interfaces for the parameters in action classed which receive input from an HttpPost action. This is because I use DI to create classes outside each layer. If I change the DefaultModelBinder to use DI to create the class see page 595 of Steve Sandersons book on MVC3 on how to do this this this works fine, e.g.p  precode    [HttpPost]     public ActionResult TestITestClass dataComingFromView              model binder creates the class via DI and then binds it to the data from the post         return View      codepre  pHowever in the above simple example above I get a conflict with the ExtensibleActionInvoker enabled, i.e. p  ol liWithout ExtensibleActionInvoker enabled the method above works fine, i.e. the extended DefaultModelBinder uses DI to create the TestClass class and modelbinder binds input from the view to the fields in the class.li liWith ExtensibleActionInvoker enabled it does not work, i.e. I get an empty TestClass class with no binding. I assume the ExtensibleActionInvoker takes precedence over the model binder and just creates an empty TestClass class.li liJust for completeness I should say that if I just use MVC out of the box, i.e. no new DefaultModelBinder and no ExtensibleActionInvoker enabled, then it says you cannot use an interface as an Action method parameter.li ol  pMy question for anyone with better Autofac knowledge than me is can I change the Autofac ExtensibleActionInvoker to select what it binds to All my injected service classed start with IService so I could filter on that. I know you can do that in Autofac elsewhere but couldnt see anything to do that with ExtensibleActionInvoker, but maybe I missed it.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p  pJon Smith  Selective Analyticsp

I want the disabled items skipped.  go on to the next one in the appropriate direction I have to use a KeyboardListener, because the UI changes some things depending on which item is selected on the list.  Trouble is, in the keyboard listener, I cannot get the COMPONENT of the item with the selected index.  This Component is not owned by the JList, and calling MyJList.getComponentindex fails with an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  1 is too large an index, even though I can see seven items, four of which are enabled.p  pHow can I programatically retreive a component by index from my JList to determine if its enabled  The only interface that seems to return a Component is getListCellRendererComponent  which changes the display of the component.  I just want to get the component to see if its enabled.p

Negative 14 pFirst, remember that a .NET codeStringcode is both codeIConvertiblecode and codeICloneablecode.p  pNow, consider the following quite simple codep  precodecontravariance in interface ICanEatltin Tgt where T  class    void EatT food   class HungryWolf  ICanEatltICloneablegt, ICanEatltIConvertiblegt    public void EatIConvertible convertibleFood        Console.WriteLineThis wolf ate your CONVERTIBLE object       public void EatICloneable cloneableFood        Console.WriteLineThis wolf ate your CLONEABLE object     codepre  pThen try the following inside some methodp  precodeICanEatltstringgt wolf  new HungryWolf wolf.Eatsheep codepre  pWhen one compiles this, one gets emnoem compiler error or warning. When running it, it looks like the method called depends on the order of the interface list in my codeclasscode declaration for codeHungryWolfcode. Try swapping the two interfaces in the comma code,code separated list.p  pThe question is simple strongShouldnt this give a compiletime warning or throw at runtimestrongp  pIm probably not the first one to come up with code like this. I used emcontravarianceem of the interface, but you can make an entirely analogous example with emcovarainaceem of the interface. And in fact a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combericlippertarchive20071109covarianceandcontravarianceincparttendealingwithambiguity.aspxMr Lippert did just thata a long time ago. In the comments in his blog, almost everyone agrees that it should be an error. Yet they allow this silently. strongWhystrongp  pstrongstrongp  pstrongExtended questionstrongp  pAbove we exploited that a codeStringcode is both codeIconvertiblecode interface and codeICloneablecode interface. Neither of these two interfaces derives from the other.p  pNow heres an example with base classes that is, in a sense, a bit worse.p  pRemember that a codeStackOverflowExceptioncode is both a codeSystemExceptioncode direct base class and an codeExceptioncode base class of base class. Then if codeICanEatltgtcode is like beforep  precodeclass Wolf2  ICanEatltExceptiongt, ICanEatltSystemExceptiongt   also try reversing the interface order here    public void EatSystemException systemExceptionFood        Console.WriteLineThis wolf ate your SYSTEM EXCEPTION object       public void EatException exceptionFood        Console.WriteLineThis wolf ate your EXCEPTION object     codepre  pTest it withp  precodestatic void Main    var w2  new Wolf2   w2.Eatnew StackOverflowException           OK, one overload is more specific than the other    ICanEatltStackOverflowExceptiongt w2Soe  w2     Contravariance   w2Soe.Eatnew StackOverflowException        Depends on interface order in Wolf2  codepre  pStill no warning, error or exception.

Negative 14 pI have a block device driver which is working, after a fashion. It is for a PCIe device, and I am handling the bios directly with a makerequestfn rather than use a request queue, as the device has no seek time. However, it still has transaction overhead.p  pWhen I read consecutively from the device, I get bios with many segments generally my maximum of 32, each consisting of 2 hardware sectors so 2  2k and this is then handled as one scattergather transaction to the device, saving a lot of signaling overhead. However on a write, the bios each have just one segment of 2 sectors and therefore the operations take a lot longer in total. What I would like to happen is to somehow cause the incoming bios to consist of many segments, or to merge bios sensibly together myself. What is the right approach herep  pThe current content of the codemakerequestfncode is something along the lines ofp  ul liDetermine readwrite of the bioli liFor each segment in the bio, make an entry in a codescatterlistcode with codesgsetpagecodeli liMap this scatterlist to PCI with codepcimapsgcodeli liFor every segment in the scatterlist, add to a devicespecific structure defining a multiplesegment DMA scattergather operationli liMap that structure to DMAli liCarry out transactionli liUnmap structure and SG DMAli liCall codebioendiocode with codeEIOcode if failed and code0code if succeeded.li ul  pThe request queue is set up likep  precodedefine MYDEVBLOCKMAXSEGS 32 define MYDEVSECTORSIZE 2048  blkqueuemakerequestmydevgtqueue, mydevmakereq  setbitQUEUEFLAGNONROT, ampmydevgtqueuegtqueueflags blkqueuemaxsegmentsmydevgtqueue, MYDEVBLOCKMAXSEGS blkqueuephysicalblocksizemydevgtqueue, MYDEVSECTORSIZE blkqueuelogicalblocksizemydevgtqueue, MYDEVSECTORSIZE  blkqueueflushmydevgtqueue, 0  blkqueuesegmentboundarymydevgtqueue, 1UL blkqueuemaxsegmentsmydevgtqueue, MYDEVBLOCKMAXSEGS blkqueuedmaalignmentmydevgtqueue, 0x7 codepre

Negative 14 pGood dayp  pIve been working on a WPF app for some time now as a learning experience and oh boy it was a learning experience and its finally ready for release. Release means installing it on my HTPC where it will be used to browse my movie collection.p  pI designed it on my PC which runs 19201080 but at the normal DPI setting, while the HTPCTV is running at the same resolution but a higher DPI setting for obvious reasons.p  pThe problem is my app goes bonkers on the HTPC, messing up pretty much everything as far as visuals go. I know this is due to bad design mea culpa, but since its an application that will only be used by me Im looking for an quick fix, not a full redesign. I read it would be possible to stop the app from being DPI aware by adding the following to AssemblyInfo.csp  precode[assembly System.Windows.Media.DisableDpiAwareness] codepre  pHowever, it doesnt seem to have any effect and the behavior of the app remains the same.p  pCould anyone point me in the right directionp  pThank you, Johanp

Negative 14 pI am having some issues that I am hoping you will be able to clarify. I have self taught myself a video encoding process similar to Mpeg2. The process is as followsp  ol lipSplit an RGBA image into 4 separate channel data memory blocks. so an array of all R values, a separate array of G values etc.pli liptake the array and grab a block of 8x8 pixel data, to transform it using the Discrete Cosine Transform DCT.pli lipQuantize this 8x8 block using a precalculated quantization matrix.pli lipZigzag encode the output of the quantization step. So I should get a trail of consecutive numbers.pli lipRun Length Encode RLE the output from the zigzag algorithm.pli lipHuffman Code the data after the RLE stage. Using substitution of values from a precomputed huffman table.pli lipGo back to step 2 and repeat until all the channels data has been encodedpli lipGo back to step 2 and repeat for each channelpli ol  pFirst question is do I need to convert the RGBA values to YUVA YCbCrA values for the process to work or can it continue using RGBA I ask as the RGBAYUVA conversion is a heavy workload that I would like to avoid if possible.p  pNext question. I am wondering should the RLE store runs for just 0s or can that be extended to all the values in the array See examples belowp  precode 440000000111  [2,4][7,0][3,1]    RLE for all values  or  440000000111  44[7,0]111         RLE for 0s only codepre  pThe final question is what would a single symbol be in regard to the huffman stage would a symbol to be replaced be a value like 2 or 4, or would a symbol be the Runlevel pair [2,4] for example.p  pThanks for taking the time to read and help me out here. I have read many papers and watched many youtube videos, which have aided my understanding of the individual algorithms but not how they all link to together to form the encoding process in code.p

Negative 14 pMy objective is to fetch public data from user timeline like statuses, feeds, username, hometown etc. I am using desktop application in Java which sends HTTP request with access token to get the timeline data. There are 2 types of tokens out of which one gives me complete data what i want and other gives me partial data. Both mentioned below.p  pstrongType 1.strong Generated on Graph API Explorer after clicking Get Access Token and giving the permissionsp  pThis expires in 1 hour period and provides me all data what I want from user timeline like statuses, id, username, feeds etc.. For this I use below url and make HTTP call to API codehttpsgraph.facebook.comltUsernamegtfieldsid,name,statuses.fieldsmessageampaccesstokenAAACEdcode This gives me all the mentioned fields in the response JSON.p  pstrongType 2.strong Generated after creating app.p  pUsing the appId amp appSecret I generated a short lived access token. This expires in 1 hour period. After this using the docs and url mentioned on a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocshowtosloginextendingtokens relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocshowtosloginextendingtokensa I am able to generate long lived access tokens these expire in about 60 days.p  pWhen I use this token in the above url to authenticate, it doesnt resolve my objective and returns limited info from user timeline. It does not return statuses field and only few public feeds from the timeline.p  pThe strongproblemstrong here is the access token which gives me all the data expires within an hour and is impossible for me to change it in my application after every hour manually, and the second access token which is long lived but does not give me complete data.p  pSo I want Long lived User access token not app generated access token, which gives me all the data. i.e I want the long lived access token of type 1 described above. Process to extend the expiry time of the access token requires app id amp secret but Graph API Explorer doesnt have the same.p  pPlease suggest a way out to get the long lived access token of type 1 or any other way to get my objective fulfilled. Please help.p
Negative 14 pI am having a problem with a UI that I am building in a Google Spreadsheet. I will First explain a little about how it works and than I will get to the problem. The UI is fairly simple program that connects to a SQL database, it allows users to create new records, Query, search, and render reports. I have created all the panels eg the intro page, the create record in the GUI builder. As the user navigates through the UI I swap out a Grid with the new panel that i want the user to see. For example on the intro page there is a create button when the user clicks the button the gird where there intro panel was is replaced by the create record panel. I have created two ways for the user querysearch for data. The first way is to select a number range on the intro panel and click the Query button. This will than query the last 10 or so records into a GUI built Panel that I will call MainForm. The second way is to search for a job. On the intro page there is a search button when the user clicks with button it goes to a new page the grid is switched to the search panel. On the new pagepanel the user can put in some parameters to search for. After the user clicks the search button the program should load the search results into the MainForm in the same way as when you Query from the intro page. I have taken the whole function apart line by line, so i am sure that the issue has to do with loading the panelComponent. What i mean by that is these few lines of code. p  precode  var Component  app.loadComponentMainForm   var panel  app.createVerticalPanel.setSize770px, 900px.addComponent   app.getElementByIdcontentGrid.setWidget0,0, panel codepre  pBut why would it load in one case, but not in another Also it is not the method of loading the Component, rather it is the returning the panel Component. p  pTo Summarize, When I load the Component with the query function it works, but when i load the Component in the search function I get and error Incompatible type passed in as a parameter. Also I load the MainForm Component in two other functions as and it works most of the time, but some times I get the same error.  p

This checks to see if it would go to the next page and if soo, then it does an AddPagep  pThe issue Im having is that when I dont have it in a function, it works perfectly, but when I put it within a function, I get errors when calling the methods in the class represented by oPdf.p  pSo, my question generally is this Is it possible to have a regular function in PHP call a class method as I have below If it is possible, what am I doing wrongp  pERROR GENERATED IS p  precodeFatal error Call to a member function GetStringWidth on a nonobject in homejarodmopublichtmlcmsattorneysignatureblock.php on line 18 codepre  pOh, and an explanation of my function just in case youre interested or someone else finds it.p  pText has n for new lines in it so the PDF will put the text of the signature block on the next line. Each new array element should be a new line, so I would need to multiply the number of lines by my line height, 5 in this case. See total  5.  p  pI check to see where we are on the page, find the difference between the page height and the Y position, then check that against the height of the signature block. If the signature block is bigger, then it wouldnt fit and I know we need a manual page break.p  pAlso, because I do the explode with the n to see the lines, I also have to check to make sure that none of the lines is still wider than the page otherwise it would word wrap and really be 2 lines or more where I was only counting it as 1 because it was just one array element. I know a signature block shouldnt have text wide enough to be on 2 lines, but I wrote this to be applicable for more than just signature blocks. I wanted to be able to call this function anywhere I wanted to make sure certain text stayed on the same page. Call the function, check the text Im about to write to the PDF and move on knowing that the desired text would all be on the same page.p  pThanks for all of the help and comments. SO is the best.p

Negative 14 pI have several modules that build to static libraries. Depending on whats needed, some of the static libraries may be linked, and others may not. Several of these static libraries have classes that have a static Init method. The Core library, which is also linked in, also has an Init method, and previously it contained multiple lines likep  precodeTelephonyInit codepre  pBut if Telephony is not going to be linked into this specific application, I dont want to have to modify the Core librarys code to remove that line. So I tried something likep  precodeclass inithookbase  public     inline inithookbase  CoreAddInitHookthis  protected     friend class Core     virtual inithookbase      virtual void operator const  0   templateltclass Tgt class inithookt  protected     void operator const              TInit       codepre  pAnd then I would just make a static global variable likep  precodestatic inithooktltTelephonygt telephonyinithook codepre  pIn the Telephony library, and that would allow Core to call TelephonyInit indirectly without knowing about it at compile time. Unfortunately, telephonyinithook is not getting constructed, and Im assuming its getting stripped in the linking phase despite its constructor having side effects. Doing something likep  precodevoid TelephonyInit  voidtelephonyinithook  codepre  pAlso doesnt work, because Init itself is also unreachable as far as the linker is concerned. Is there a way to achieve this style of modularity with C Compiler specific options are viable, so long as theres an equivalent for both GCC and VC.

Negative 14 pSo Ive been messing around with the packaging feature that NetBeans offers, following this tutorial a hrefhttpplatform.netbeans.orgtutorialsnbmnbi.html relnofollowhttpplatform.netbeans.orgtutorialsnbmnbi.htmla. I didnt like how I had to modify the platform that my IDE was running on in order to customize the installer itself, so I decided to create a copy and just change the platform the application suite was using PropertiesLibraries.p  pThis seemed to work fine, and even packaged that platform as part of the installer. However, when doing the packaging itself, I noticed that it was calling the IDEs platform build script to create the installer rather than the one I had customized. This defeats the purpose, at least in my case, of having the separate platform.p  pWithin the platform manager, under the harness tab, I made sure that the platforms harness was being used rather than the IDEs, but it didnt seem to make a difference.p  pI verified the behaviour by throwing an echo into both the default IDE platform and my customized platform to see which was being called. I also noticed that the Ant call that gets made at the start of packaging makes an explicit reference to the IDE platform, as well.p  pIve tried this under 7.2 currently using 7.3 as 7.3 has had some fairly nasty bugs and thought perhaps it was just recently introduced.p  pAt this point Im thinking its a bug, but I was hoping that perhaps someone else had come across this and found some sort of solution or could shed some light on why its doing what its doing.p  pThanksp

Negative 14 pI am trying to do some custom implementation of blocking queue with fixed length array of byte arrays. I am not removing polled elements, therefore I adjusted put method to return byte array so that it can be written directly producer thread uses MappedByteBuffer to write directly to this byte array. I added commitPut method to simply increase counters and set lengths arrays. if multiple threads would be writing this could be the concurrency problems, but I know that only one thread is writing.p  pBelow is what I currently have. It works if I debug through step by step, but if I run it looks like it encounters some locking problems. I copied, stripped down and adjusted ArrayBlockingQueue code.

Negative 14 pSo, I noticed when I recently checked out the newest dev version of Django that support for the builtin comments system django has used is being dropped. The reason being that rarely is the builtin framework sufficient or efficient for a developers needs.p  pI am aware of the suggestion to use a service like Disqus, and also aware that Django will retain the package for legacy purposes, but neither of these are optimal for many scenarios. p  pDisqus cant tie into a sites own user authentication without fancy javascripting, and even then it requires the users sign in using another service. This can be mitigated by a rather expensive Disqus subscription, of course, but again, not optimal in many cases.p  pUsing a deprecated portion of a framework tends to be poor practice when building new apps, so that option is out for those of us who are picky about good practice.p  pIn light of this, I was wondering, what are some suggestions from the community for how to build ones own comments system  What would be the most pythonicdjangoic methods for a comments implementation which supports things like nesting, anonymousauthenticated commenting options, and perhaps even a dash of ajax support builtin What about the ability to use one commenting solution for multiple modelsp  pI hope this question is appropriate, as it is a bit abstract, but with deprecation looming, I think stack qa could use somewhere for users to start Thankyou for your timep

Negative 14 pIm trying to display a Javascript prompt for the user to enter data as prompts are used for. But, it wont show. window.alert shows, and so does window.confirm. But, not prompt. Heres the code Im trying to runp  precodevar isexpired  document.getElementByIdisexpired.value     if isexpired  yes          alertisexpired         var answer  promptAre you sure you         alertanswer      codepre  pWhen this runs, the if statement is entered. The first alert displays yes as it should. But, then, it skips the prompt line. The next alert displays saying Undefined.p  pNow, if the only thing I change is the keyword prompt, it will work, as suchp  precodevar isexpired  document.getElementByIdisexpired.value     if isexpired  yes          alertisexpired         var answer  confirmAre you sure you         alertanswer      codepre  pWhen I run this, the confirm box appears. If I click Okay, then the next alert says true and if I click Cancel the alert says false.p  pSo, the big takeaway here is that there isnt a syntax error thats causing the Javascript to stop. Its actually skipping over that single line and continuing execution. Whats wrong with that line Ive checked multiple sites to ensure its correct.  Adding the second default parameter does not help either. I tried that. Also, There are no Javascript errors to indicate the problem.p  pI went a hrefhttpwww.w3schools.comjstryit.aspfilenametryjsprompt relnofollowherea and changed it to my code I hardcoded isexpired to be yes, and it works there.p  pAny help would be fantastic. Thanks.p  pEDIT To be clear, Im not relying on W3schools example to be accurate, I used their try it out page to test my own code. I also did this on jfiddle and it worked fine.

Negative 14 pSo in the WPF project Im just starting I have a UserControl that will be eventully functioning as a sort of document tab I have simplified the code for this question. On the UserControl is a TextBlock, and the desired behavior is that when the user mouses over the control the text should change color. The XAML below works resources defined in another file BUT the ColorAnimation happens to every instance of the UserControl, not just the one Im mousing over. So if I scatter some of these controls over the UI and mouse over one of them, ALL of them change color. Why Ive tried adding the triggers to the UserControl, the Grid, and the TextBlock itself but it appears to make no difference.

Negative 14 pI have a button that Ive wrapped in a directive, like so [button typebutton classbtn btnprimary stdbuttonbuttonSize tttapclick ngtransclude] [button] not using [ of coursep  pAlso, notice the mytap directive. That is used to get around the 300ms delay caused by an iPad waiting to see if a click is in fact a double click. It detects the touchend and touchmove events that are raised by a touch screen and handles them appropriately.p  pThe mytap directive works fine. The situation I have is that when a button is used to navigate between two views, and a similar button exists in the same location on the screen in the other view, the embedded browser is leaving the button in the other view in a selected state after the navigation has happened I assume it is applying the btnprimary.active CSS class as per bootstrap, or something similar.p  pVia my custom mytap directive I am able to prevent the button on the second view from being erroneously clicked because my finger cant lift off the screen before another touchend event happens on the second view. That works fine. But how can I get the button on the second view to be left in an unselected state Should I set a timer or something and then explicitly set the class on the button tag back to appear unselectedp

Negative 14 pWere working on an MVC app and we need to allow users to upload these file typesp  pDOCX, XLSX, PPTX, Text, PDF, CSV, JPG and PNG.p  pAll other file types must be prohibited.p  pObviously, people can rename an executable file as a DOCX and upload it, so we do some rudimentary checks. For example, we check that the file doesnt start with the MZ byte signature, etc.p  pIf they upload PNG or JPG, we check that they can be read using the .NET Bitmap class and that their dimensions fit within our parameters.p  pHowever, people are very clever and devious. We need to have a robust solution that allows valid file types without letting executables, batch files, etc. to be uploaded.p  pFor example, people can ZIP an EXE and try to upload it as a .DOCX file. Because DOCX files are zipped and start with the PK signature, it gets tricky.p  pFurthermore, we dont want to install MS OFfice on our servers so using automation to test the uploads is not an option.p  pShort of reading up on all the binary specs for all the different file formats, whats the best way to handle this scenariop

Negative 14 pI am creating a translucent window on top of my application that is visible at all times. It shows some logs as I use the application. p  pTo do this, I created a service that used the window SYSTEMSERVICE to display a translucent UI on screen. This service is a part of a library. I added the service and the required permissions to my applications manifest file. p  pI start the service from the library through an observer class. Now, I need to display a list within that translucent window. This list should autoscroll. The data for the list view is part of the same observer class that keeps adding strings to the list. I created an adapter and listview in my serviceas a view and added it to the translucent window. p  pI want to update the list now. Accessing the adapter object from this observer class and calling notifyDataSetChanged when the arraylist of strings is updated crashes my app with thisp  pandroid.view.ViewRootImplCalledFromWrongThreadException Only the original thread that created a view hierarchy can touch its views.p  pIf I initialize the adapter in the Service, how can I call notifyDataSetChanged from the observer class when there is an update to the list p  pI am using app context everywhere. The underlying application should function like it always does. p  pAny ideasp

Negative 14 pSuppose say there are more than 15 usecases in the application which use the same set of file and JSP to render the page. Say for example all usecases use the confirmation page before you do any transaction. How do I efficiently code to render the page based on various different inputs Currently the java file that is being called does the check and uses a switch statement which renders the dynamic part of the JSP. But this has lead to hardcoding of JSP code into Java file and is causing issues while doing the styling enhancements as jars need to be built many times. Is putting the various possible JSP code into a property file a better idea or is there some other efficient design for the samep

Negative 14 pIm with a database design question which i really need some help and advice.p  pIts for a Auction platform weve built. The initial strategy was users can bid a single auction, and MongoDB was chosen for the job and so far so good. p  pNow im trying to implement a different schema to support group of auctions, so that a user can create a group of several auctions and costumers can bid a auction or a group.p  pGroup 1p  ul liAuction A li liAuction Bli liAuction Cli ul  pGroup 3p  ul liAuction Dli ul  pIm struggling with the right approach. Ideally when searching for auctions, the API return would group all auctions within Groups.

When a user publish a group store the document per auction and also a extra document for the Group itself same collection marked with stronggroupIdstrong when null, i know it was the group itself. In this document i would save the properties for the auctions like sums of minimum budgets, total bids, etc.p  pBut how would i group this and return a group with a list of auctions Do you think that thiss a suitable solution or better, being MongoDB a document db is a good choose for this implementation with groupsp  pThis auction schema its for services.

Actually the custom validator code is not executing itself. p  pIn server traces, I see configuration evaluation context not found twice, guess there is some issue with the config filep  pMy config file is as followsp  precodeltconfigurationgt   ltsystem.diagnosticsgt     ltsourcesgt       ltsource nameSystem.ServiceModel               switchValueAll, ActivityTracing               propagateActivitytruegt         ltlistenersgt           ltadd namexml gt         ltlistenersgt       ltsourcegt     ltsourcesgt     ltsharedListenersgt       ltadd namexml typeSystem.Diagnostics.XmlWriterTraceListener initializeDataClogTraces.svclog gt     ltsharedListenersgt     lttrace autoflushtruegt   ltsystem.diagnosticsgt   ltsystem.serviceModelgt     ltbindingsgt       ltcustomBindinggt         ltbinding namemybindinggt           lttransactionFlow gt           lttextMessageEncoding gt           lthttpsTransport requireClientCertificatetrue gt           ltsecurity authenticationModeMutualSslNegotiatedgt         ltbindinggt       ltcustomBindinggt     ltbindingsgt     ltbehaviorsgt       ltserviceBehaviorsgt         ltbehavior namebehaviourgt           ltserviceMetadata httpsGetEnabledTruegt           ltserviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaultstrue gt           ltserviceCredentialsgt             ltclientCertificategt               ltauthentication certificateValidationModeCustom customCertificateValidatorTypemyproject.MyX509CertificateValidator,myprojectgt             ltclientCertificategt           ltserviceCredentialsgt         ltbehaviorgt       ltserviceBehaviorsgt     ltbehaviorsgt     ltservicesgt       ltservice namemyHost behaviorConfigurationbehaviourgt         ltendpoint address contractIIWCFServer bindingcustomBinding bindingConfigurationmybinding gt         ltendpoint addressmex contractIMetadataExchange bindingmexHttpsBindinggt       ltservicegt     ltservicesgt     ltdiagnosticsgt       ltmessageLogging logEntireMessagetrue                       logMessagesAtServiceLeveltrue                       logMessagesAtTransportLeveltrue                       logMalformedMessagestrue                       maxMessagesToLog5000                       maxSizeOfMessageToLog2000gt       ltmessageLogginggt     ltdiagnosticsgt   ltsystem.serviceModelgt ltconfigurationgt codepre  pI already went through 100s of article but not able to get the solution.

Negative 14 pAfter reading through some SO QampA, Im taking the recommended approach of NOT writing my own scheduler. Ive opted to use Quartz.net, as it looks to do exactly what I need. According to their quick start guide, the application should not shut down once a scheduler is instantiated until I call the shutdown method on the scheduler a hrefhttpwww.quartzscheduler.netdocumentationquartz2.xquickstart.html relnofollowhttpwww.quartzscheduler.netdocumentationquartz2.xquickstart.htmlap  pI am testing this out in a unit test, and Im finding that my nUnit test is closing without me calling shutdown on the scheduler I made my scheduler a singleton, assuming that would fix it, but no such luck. Is this behavior specific to unit testing Im assuming that since it happens in my tests, it will happen when I use it in my console app later on.p  pHere is how I put together my schedulerp  precodepublic static class Scheduler      public static IScheduler LocalScheduler  get private set       static Scheduler               get a scheduler         ISchedulerFactory schedFact  new StdSchedulerFactory         LocalScheduler  schedFact.GetScheduler           public static void ScheduleJobIJobDetail job, ITrigger trigger              LocalScheduler.ScheduleJobjob, trigger           public static void Start              if LocalScheduler.IsStarted LocalScheduler.Start           public static void Stop              LocalScheduler.Shutdown        codepre  pThe unit test in particular that is failing isp  precode    [Test, Explicit]     public void JobExecutionTest              var start  new DateTime2014,06,01         var stop  new DateTime2014,06,10           I made my own factories for the JobDataMap, IJobDetail, and ITrigger.          var jobMap  JobDataFactory.CreateConnectwiseMapstart, stop         var job  JobFactory.CreateParameterJobltConnectwiseJobgttestjob, testgroup, jobMap          fire in 5 seconds for testing         var trigger  TriggerFactory.CreateRecurringtesttrigger, testgroup, DateTime.Now.AddSeconds5         Scheduler.ScheduleJobjob, trigger         Scheduler.Start          it shuts down almost immediately      codepre  pI put a breakpoint in the job that is supposed to execute to see if it ever gets hit, and it never does because the unit test thinks its all done and closes everything. I dont want to use Thread.Sleep if I can avoid it, as when I use this scheduler elsewhere I dont want it to sit there in that state. Would wiring up a listener prevent it from dyingp

Negative 14 pI have built a rolling log table where the most recent 500 events are shown.    I do not want it to be reactive because the traffic is too high and it would have just make the screen flash constantly.  Instead, Id like to make the client poll the server every minute.p  pI have autopublish turned off already and have the server code publish only the last 500 events.  The client subscribes to the same channel as usual. Since I do not run a replica set i.e. no oplog on my mongodb, the server doesnt really act reactive at all if I use a regular mongo client to insert new documents then the meteor app would not know about it.  I think this is actually working to my advantage since I dont want the reactivity at all anyways.p  pI think I can use Meteor.setInterval to fetch data every minute but I dont know how to update the client minimongo data cache or invalidate it so it can ask the server to publish new copydeltas. p  pSorry if this is such a simple question. Im a newbie with meteor.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 14 pI have a page with many codeltvideogtcode elements in it arranged one after the other. p  pLets says 100 for now. When I click on the web page, Chrome loads the first 25 and I can see the video images displayed Ok, but then it stops and the rest remain black. I also see the page is still loading, and I see chrome saying In progress... on the lower left side of the page.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAoRPh.png altMathematica graphicsp  pUsing firefox, I can load the same page with no problem. Also using IE 11, I can load the same page with no problem and all videos show fine.p  pIn none of these cases I actually played the video yet. This is all just waiting for the page to fully load.p  pI am using local apache server on my PC. The setup is XAMPP software. So Apache is running on my PC, and I access my page using localhost.p  pNow here is the interesting thing I found. When I load the page using fileC URI, and use the same exact page, then now Chrome shows all the video elements just fine None of them is black. They all display fine and I can play them with no problem.p  pThe problem only shows up when using the apache server. So it is a buffering issue between the web server and the Chrome browser.p  pI know it is a buffering issue since if I move one of the  videos still showing black and put the link at the top of the page, and reload the page, then it is no longer black and it shows up. Nothing changed except the position of the codeltvideogtcode tag. So it seems Chrome has a limit of how many video tags it can load in one pagep  pI am using Chrome  36.0.1985.125  on windows 7. p  pI tried to change the size of the video displayed using p  precodevideo    width 200px    important   height auto   important  codepre  pBut no matter what size I use in the above, it still hangs in the same place.p  pAny suggestions what to do  I could split the web page into many different pages as last resort.p  pThis is windows 7, 64 bit.

From a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgProtocolsrfc2616rfc2616sec10.html relnofollowhttpwww.w3.orgProtocolsrfc2616rfc2616sec10.htmla it saysp  blockquote   pThe server has fulfilled the partial GET request for the resource.

Negative 14 pI am trying to follow a few UIUX best practices when developing a simple request quote form for my users.p  pI basically want them to fill only a few fields at a time as I guide them through it, giving them some feedback or update on cost depending on what they fill.

I dont want to have partialunfinished Quote objects.p  p1 I have setup a navigation controller and added a few UIViewControllers with some fields, and I can basically step through them. Adding validation to the fields before jumping to the next field is no problem.p  p2 I use parse.com as my backend, and I have a Quote object, for simplicitys sake, lets say it has the following properties firstName, lastName, location, date, options, price. p  blockquote   pI ask for location and date first  then first and last name  then   options  I then calculate a price and show it to himher  Then the user   can submit the whole thing to the server.p blockquote  pI looked around, and only found some indication to use a temporary xml file, which I then upload. Other results mainly pertain about http multi part requests, which I dont think relate.p  pWould core data be the ideal usage here Any pointers in the right direction would be really appreciated.p

Negative 14 pI have a web project that relies on two separately compiled projects and all three are in the same solution. One day out of the blue, I hit Rebuild Solution and I got a whole list of errors that Id never received before. Apparently the Rebuild would delete the dependent DLLs and then be unable to build the web project DLL because it couldnt find the dependent DLLs. Now I have another web project thats set up identically and this has never happened and on both projects the dependencies are set up correctly. If I try using just Build Solution, it works just fine. Only Rebuild Solution causes the errors to come up and it only does it on one of my projects and it never used to do it. I know of no changes between the time Rebuild worked and the time it didnt. I just opened it up one day and it decided to no longer work. Im at a total loss here so I was hoping someone may have experienced this issue before and could give me some insight. Thanks.p

Negative 14 pIm using jPlayer with the playlist addon. Ive been trying to figure out how to share playlists in various ways. Passing the values in a URL seems to be the easiest.

Naturally when the page is loaded jPlayer would have to detect whether or not there was playlist information included in the URL and load the playlist if there was, or load the defaultblank plalist if not.p  pIn my attempts to figure this out I discovered that items need to be JSON.stringifyed in order to have them not appear as [object,object] so storing a playlist looks like thisp  precodevar savedPlaylist  JSON.stringifymyPlaylist.playlist codepre  pThis will give me a variable containing what jPlayer needs to load the playlist.p  pfurther tinkering with this lead me to testing it with localStorage whereby playlists could be stored in html5 localStorage by a method likep  precodeplaylistsave.clickfunction localStorage.setItemJSON.stringifymyPlaylist.playlist  codepre  pand loaded from localStorage parsing the JSON back withp  precodeplaylistload.clickfunction myPlaylist.setPlaylistJSON.parsemyPlaylist.playlist codepre  pp  pAgain, the localStorage is not really what Im after I just used it to learn more about what the playlists save and load.

Negative 14 pI apologize if this seems like a stupid question but Im still very much a novice PythonDjango programmer.  Is it normal to create Python objects in a Django application that arent models that will be saved in the database  p  pIm creating whats become a fairly large Django application and, to me, my code is really starting to smell.  What I mean is that my views are becoming very large because Im taking a procedural rather than objectoriented approach.  My intuition tells me that my code might be simpler, easier to test, and more robust in the long run if I were using more objects with their own attributes and behaviors rather than passing information from one function to the next in my views.  p  pWhats hanging me up is that these arent objects I want to save in my database so I dont quite know if I should be using them and, if I should, where Id put them.  Is the approach Im proposing typical in a Django application  If so, where would I store those objects with respect to the Django modelviewtemplate structure  Also, are there any popular Django modules or libraries that do what Im describing that I should studyp  pThanks in advance for your response.p

I click on Log in with Disqus, and it opens a tiny popup window. Not only is it very specifically sized, its HTTPS and Firefox doesnt block it.

What sort of sorcery is necessary to get Firefox to make a little popup window for me And how would I get the response from logging in with a popup to interact with the original windowp  pIts possible that the original window uses AJAX or some kind of socket to get that the users logged in, but it seems to me that it would make much more sense to simply mod it with the response to the initial login from the popup.p  pNote that Im not looking for an indepth solution or for someone to do this for me so much as concepts or key wordsmethods that I should be looking into related to this sort of thing  What does JS use to spawn these custom popups, and what does it use to detect and interact with windows not in focusp

Negative 14 pI was pushing 3 changesets with TortoisHg to an SVN repository using hgsubversion extension.

I tried all sorts of rebase, and exporting the changes to patch and back, but it didnt help.p  pThen I found, if I look into SVN repository, 2 of these changesets are actually there. Its just my mercurial repo is not aware of it. Pull doesnt help. So I used MQStrip command on all three to remove them, and then I tried to pull to get them from SVN. But mercurial doesnt pull anything, it says no changes detected. So my SVN repository has two more changesets, then mercurial repo.p  pHow can I fix the repository, so it works againp  pI have a copy of the whole thing before I made strip if it helps, as well as all three changesets exported to .patch files.p  pObviously I dont want to get everything from SVN from scratch, because these are thousands of revisions, and there are some branches which I need but which never went to SVN.p

Negative 14 pEDIT I ended up looking up the solutions to the question I am the duplicate of, and crafting the following snippet of codep  precodeimport sys from collections import deque  inputdeque[]  def readword     global input     while leninput0         linesys.stdin.readline.split         for word in line             input.appendword     return input.popleft  def readint     return intreadword codepre  pORIGINAL QUESTIONp  pI want to write some programs reading input from stdin in Python. But the input processing is killing me  I dont see a nice way to scan data that is not wellaligned in lines. For example, if I have to scan an integer N, and then N words to process, in C I would do it like thisp  precodeint N char str[100] scanfd,ampN forint i0iltNi     scanfs,str     do stuff with str  codepre  pThis program would scan all of the following input in exactly the same wayp  precodeinput 1 3 word1 word2 word3 input 2 3 word1 word2 word3 input 3 3 word1 word2 word3 input 4 3 word1 word2 word3 codepre  pI like the flexibility Clike scanf gives to me, and Id like to see something like that in Python too. I cannot use input, because it would try to parse strings as Python syntax possibly ending up with dictionary or something like that, and rawinput operates on newlineended lines. Function sys.stdin.read is not good too, because it waits until the whole input is given and I may want to display partial results in real time. The only way I see to implement such functionability would be to use sys.stdin.readline in a loop, trying to parse each line independently until all words needed are parsed. But this is not very elegant solution, and it has some flaws as well  for example, if the example program mentioned above should input one more thing in its further action, and this word or number were given in the same line as last word, the Python program would not parse it properly.p  pProblematic input would bep  precodeinput 5 3 word1 word2 word3 nextinput codepre  pThe word nextinput would be swallowed by the readline function, even though it might be needed by a program later. Again, this can be workedaround by supplying a temporary buffer of inputyettobeparsedbutalreadyinputted, but it would soon become very buggy code. Is there a truly pythonic way to do this Or am I missing something obviousp

Negative 14 pI have reviewed and implemented  tested all the messaging options with ServiceStack that I know of and Ive searched on and off for a long time.  The two are PubSub and RedisMQ.  Both of these have limitations that I needed to go beyond.  I have already done this and have a solution that works perfectly for my system.  The purpose of this posting  question is to see if I missed a better way, and a check on if my solution is really threadsafe.  So far it is working well and I think it is good.p  pWhat I did was create an exchange class, and then a pub class and a sub class. My need was to have an arbitrary number of publishers, in any number of threads, publish to an arbitrary number of subscribers, in any number of threads.  The only restriction is that my publisher and my subscriber can not be in the same thread, as this causes deadlock.  This is by design, so for me not a limitation, as I want blocking subscribers this could actually be changed with one line of code, but is not my application need and would actually be a negative.  Also note that the subscribers can be to unique publishers or any number of subscribers to the same publisher fanout.  This was the MQ limitation I needed to resolve.  The PubSub limitations were even greater, but lets not digress into why they did not solve my needs.p  pThe usage construct for what I call RedisMEnQ En  Enqueue because it uses Redis.EnqueueItemOnList is to instantiate the pub class for each publisher, and a sub class for each subscriber.  The pub and sub classes both own an instance of the exchange class, thus sharing the same exchange code.  There is no direct interaction between pub and sub classes except through Redis.  The exchange code implements locks so that the various threads are thread safe during exchange transactions, and of course the redis connections are unique for each thread and thus thread safe.p  pThe Exchange code is the most interesting, and quite short, so I thought Id post itp  precodepublic class Subscriber      public int id  get set      public string key  get set      public bool active  get set    public class RedisQueueExchange      private IRedisListltSubscribergt RedisSubscribers     IRedisClient Redis     public string Key  get set      public const string SubscriberListKey  exchangesubscribers     private int id     public int ID  get  return id  private set  id  value       private Object thisLock  new Object   Mutuall exclusion lock      public RedisQueueExchangeIRedisClient redis, string key              Key  key         Redis  redis         RedisSubscribers  Redis.AsltSubscribergt.Lists[SubscriberListKey]           private int addSubscriberstring key         Subscriber sub  new Subscriber  id  0, active  true, key  key          ListltSubscribergt subscribers  RedisSubscribers.GetAll         int idx  subscribers.FindIndexx gt x.active         if idx lt 0                      sub.id  idx  subscribers.Count             RedisSubscribers.Addsub                  else                      sub.id  idx             RedisSubscribers[idx]  sub                   return idx           private ListltSubscribergt findSubscribersstring key              ListltSubscribergt subscribers  RedisSubscribers.GetAll         return subscribers.FindAllx gt x.key.Equalskey           public int Subscribe         lock thisLock                      ID  addSubscriberKey             return ID                    public string getSubscribeKeyint id              return sub  id.ToString    Key           public void UnSubscribeint id              lock thisLock                      ListltSubscribergt subscribers  RedisSubscribers.GetAll             int idx  subscribers.FindIndexx gt x.id  id             RedisSubscribers[idx].active  false                    public int pubMsgstring msg              lock thisLock                      ListltSubscribergt subList  findSubscribersKey             int retVal  subList.Count             foreach Subscriber sub in subList                              string subkey  sub  sub.id.ToString    Key                 Redis.EnqueueItemOnListsubkey, msg                          return retVal                    public void clearExchange         ifRedisSubscribers  null              RedisSubscribers.Clear       codepre  pThere are lots of ways to approach the problem, but to understand the code one thing should be clarified.  I am reusing subscriber ids.  That makes it slightly more complex than it would be otherwise.  I didnt want to have unnecessary gaps in subscriber ids, so if a subscriber unsubscribes, the next subscriber will pick up the unused id.  I put the locks in so that a subscriber does not partly subscribe while a publisher is publishing.  Either the subscriber is fully subscribed or not at all.  p

Negative 14 pOK, so my latest project requires loading an Excel 2007 spreadsheet into a SQL Server table. Im working in SSIS 2008R2. Based on some stuff I found on the internet, I opened the Excel source in Advanced editor and changed the datatype of the long column to DTNTEXT, so that it wouldnt truncate it. Then I made the database column VARCHARMAX. This runs correctly in debug mode on my laptop.p  pThen I deployed it to the development server and attempted to load the same test file. It failed with the following error messagesp  precodeError Code 0xC0208265        Source Main Data Flow Task Get Main Data [1]        Description Failed to retrieve long data for column DESCR.

An error occurred on the specified object of the specified component.  There may be error messages posted before this with more information about the failure. End Error codepre  pSearching for information about the error, I found about a million sites offering the same three suggested solutionsp  ol lipAdd IMEX1 to the extended properties of the connection string.br  It was already there.pli lipChange the TypeGuessRows key in the registry.br  This was set to zero on the server, which I understand to mean that it should look at the entire file. Nevertheless, I changed it to 8 to match my laptop. The same error occurred when I ran it again. Then I changed it to 1,763, which is more than the number of rows in the spreadsheet. It still gave the same error. So, I put it back to zero. Theres a 1,900character value in the first row of my test file, so it shouldnt really matter how many it checks, in this case.pli lipChange the datatype to DTWSTR4000 in the source.br  The column is supposed to have up to 10,000 characters, so Im not sure this would be a good idea even if it worked. However, I tried it anyway. This time it gave me a truncation error. I changed the truncation error disposition to ignore failure and it loaded the data, but truncated the value to 255 characters. I have verified that the length is 4000 and doesnt get changed when I save the file, but its still truncating at 255 characters.pli ol  pI have no idea what else to look at. Any help would be appreciated.p  pUPDATE 129 The package, without any changes, works correctly when running on the preproduction server. It still fails when running on the development server. Both servers have the same version of SSIS including minor version numbers as well as the same versions of Windows, Access and Excel. I do not know how to explain this, nor do I know how to tell if it would work in production.p

Negative 14 pI have an application that Im building in Laravel, this being the second time Ive used it seriously. The application provides you the ability to log in and access certain areas of the site that guestsvisitors may not have access to. This is pretty standard fare of every website with a signup option, and Laravel by default provides some standard ways to handle them with their already made filtersp  precode LARAVEL DEFAULT FILTER Routefilterauth, function      if Authguest              if Requestajax                      return ResponsemakeUnauthorized, 401                  else                      return Redirectguestlogin                codepre  pMy application takes this a step further and provides various permissions you could also call them levels or roles, that a user can have. Sort of similar, but far less complicated than say, Stack Overflow. I am shimming an enum to represent these levels, with a higher number providing more access to areas others may not havep  precodeabstract class UserRole      const Unauthenticated  1     const Member  2     const Subscriber  3     const CharterSubscriber  4     const Moderator  5     const Administrator  6  codepre  pBecause of this, Ive found myself setting up filters which are very similar to each other, and I feel like Im violating DRY because of it. The filters check if you have the necessary permissions to access certain pages, like sop  precodeRoutefiltermustBeMemberOrGreater, function      if Authguest  Authusergtroleid lt UserRoleMember          return Redirecthome        RoutefiltermustBeSubscriberOrGreater, function      if Authguest  Authusergtroleid lt UserRoleSubscriber          return Redirecthome        RoutefiltermustBeModeratorOrGreater, function      if Authguest  Authusergtroleid lt UserRoleModerator          return Redirecthome         etc, etc codepre  pAs you can see, theyre all very similar to each other. strongIs there anyway I can wrap this functionality up into something less duplicativestrong All I know of is Laravel filters as Im using them now. What other filter setup alternatives do I have at my disposal Should I even be using filters, should this sort of logic be better in my Controllersp  pAll input is appreciated.p

Negative 14 pI have form that has about 20 text box controls and I would like to fire the TextChanged event with out adding the event for each individual text box. Is there a way to loop through the text boxes to fire this event What I am trying to do is clear a label control when the text changes. Instead of displaying a message box, for error descriptions, I use a label control to display the message. I also set it up where if a text box has invalid data, I select all text and give focus to that text box so when user reenters information the label control clears the message. p  pEditp  pTo clear up some confusion, here is some of my code from my validation methodp  precode if txtBentLeadsQty.Text                        ValidData  true             BentLeadsCount  0                  else                       if int.TryParsetxtBentLeadsQty.Text.Trim, out BentLeadsCount                 ValidData  true             else                              ValidData  false                 lblError.Text  Bent Lead Qty must be a numeric value                 txtBentLeadsQty.SelectAll                 txtBentLeadsQty.Focus                       codepre  pI already have a way to check for numeric values, and I put code in to select all text entered and gave focus if the values are not numeric, I just want to have a way to clear the label control when the the text is changes like if the user hit backspace or starts typing that why if the error occurs, I highlight all the text in that text box if it is not valid. I can do this if I put code in every text boxes TextChanged event, but to save coding I was wondering if there is way to clear the label control if any of the text boxes throws an error from my validation method instead of adding individual events for 20 text boxes. Note Not all text boxes will have data entered, these are quantity text boxes I put code in to assign a 0 to the variable if the text box in null. p

Negative 14 pIm having a problem with the unbind event from jquery. I load a modal after clicking a button and in this modal I have two possibilities, continue or cancel.

Negative 14 pIve been building a web analytics component that I want to wrap up as a NuGet package. It has an endpoint that a JavaScript tracker sends info to, much like Google Analytics, and a dashboard to view results.p  pI was looking at Glimpse as an example of how to build reusable ASP.Net components. Glimpse functionality is served through a Glimpse.axd HttpHandler endpoint. I was wondering why it took that approach If it only needed to support ASP.Net MVC, would it make more sense to just use an MVC or Web API controllerp  pEdit clarified that its the mechanism, not theasy .axd extension Im curious about.p
Negative 14 pIve only recently started using Log4j with my application. Im developing on eclipse on a windows machine, but Im deploying it to a server running CentOS. p  pWhen Im running the application in eclipse, Log4j works as expected.  I have a folder codesrcmainresourcescode where the Log4j properties file is stored, everything is configured and Log4j correctly saves a logfile and outputs to console.  p  pI thought, since the properties file is part of the project it would be compiled with the jar and execute as normal when I moved it, but apparently thats not the case.  p  pWhen I export the jar and run it on the server Log4j tells me that I have no configuration file set up. So that got me thinking that maybe the file isnt exported with the jar.  p  pWhile looking for a solution I came across a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12532339noappenderscouldbefoundforloggerlog4jthis questiona and tried the simpler option of adding this code to my main method p  precodeString log4jConfPath  pathtolog4j.properties PropertyConfigurator.configurelog4jConfPath codepre  pSuccess The logger now works, I put the codelog4j.propertiescode file beside the jar file on the server and pointed to it. p  pNow however Im getting the following errorp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comev8bt.png altLog4j Error p  p...but the logging is working.  So whats going on here Has it turned out that the original properties file was actually included and is now being ignored because I pointed to another onebr But if that was the case, why does it show up as an error  p  pIs there a problem with the external properties file  If so, why does logging work now p  pstrongEDITstrong Im running this app as a service in CentOS using codesystemdcode. The error only occurs when I start the app as a service. if disable the service and run it as a java app with codesudo java jar myapp.jarcode I dont get any errors.p

In the case of pressing the button on my suppervisors profile, it errors out with codeError executing child request for...code.p  pHere is what Ive triedp  pcodeSystem.Web.HttpContext.Current.Server.Transfercode, codeResponse.Redirectcode, codeHttpContext.Current.RewritePathcode, codeContext.RewritePathcodep  pbut none of those are giving the same functionality that Server.Transfer is giving when working correctly.p  pNote There is an object that is being loaded into the Context, and I need to maintain that Context on the next page.p  pAny advice on how to work around this Ive checked the data in the database, and all seems to be coherent.p  pThanks in advance.p

This table also contains multiple records per product, with different pricing schemes, but I am only interested in the cheapest min price of them all, for the specific currency I am querying.p  pThe end goal is used for a faceted search on products, where a user can select a price ranged to list products within that specific range.p  pThis is the overall query that Ive tried which I thought was the closest attemptp  precodeSELECT      FROM      productline  LEFT JOIN                                 SELECT   idproductline,                              idpricegroup,                              CASE                                       WHEN EXISTS                                                                                                       SELECT currencycode                                                       FROM   productlineprice                                                       WHERE  currencycode  GBP                                                       AND    idproductline  productlineprice.idproductline THEN Minprice                                      ELSE Minprice0.5098                              END AS userprice                     FROM     productlineprice                     WHERE    deleted                     AND                              CASE                                       WHEN EXISTS                                                                                                       SELECT currencycode                                                       FROM   productlineprice                                                       WHERE  currencycode  GBP                                                       AND    idproductline  productlineprice.idproductline THEN currencycode  GBP                                      ELSE currencycode  AUD                              END                     GROUP BY idproductline                     ORDER BY productlineprice.idproductline ASC AS productlineprice  ON        productline.idproductline  productlineprice.idproductline  WHERE     productline.deleted  AND       productline.idproductlinestatus  1  AND       productline.idproductline IN                               SELECT idproductline                   from   productlinehasproductcategory                   where  idproductcategory  103  AND                                       productlineprice.idpricegroup IN                                                                       SELECT idpricegroup                                       FROM   pricegroup                                       WHERE  deleted                                       AND    PUBLIC                                       AND    active            AND                                       userprice lt 250  ORDER BY  productline.idproductline ASC codepre  pAnd the sub query Im having trouble with is this onep  precodeSELECT   idproductline,                              idpricegroup,                              CASE                                       WHEN EXISTS                                                                                                       SELECT currencycode                                                       FROM   productlineprice                                                       WHERE  currencycode  GBP                                                       AND    idproductline  productlineprice.idproductline THEN Minprice                                      ELSE Minprice0.5098                              END AS userprice                     FROM     productlineprice                     WHERE    deleted                     AND                              CASE                                       WHEN EXISTS                                                                                                       SELECT currencycode                                                       FROM   productlineprice                                                       WHERE  currencycode  GBP                                                       AND    idproductline  productlineprice.idproductline THEN currencycode  GBP                                      ELSE currencycode  AUD                              END                     GROUP BY idproductline                     ORDER BY productlineprice.idproductline ASC codepre  pSo, I need to be able to retrieve the value for the GBP currency if it exists, otherwise default to the AUD currency and apply a currency conversion. Some of the numbers here are hardcoded for testing, and will be supplied via variables later.p  pI have a feeling that with the above subquery, the EXISTS subqueries are not correctly using the idproductline values, as when I run it, I ONLY get GBP results, even though there are plenty of records in that table with no GBP result. The subquery Im talking about is this onep  precodeSELECT currencycode  FROM   productlineprice  WHERE  currencycode  GBP  AND    idproductline  productlineprice.idproductline codepre  pCan anyone see where I am going wrong I feel like I am so close, but something in that subquery is just wrong, and SQL is not my strongest suit.p  h1EDIT 1h1  pMy main concern is with the sub query that contains the EXISTS clauses, I know the rest of it works and provided the entire query purely for contextual purposes.p  pYou can download a dump of the table in question and some sample data from the following link.

Negative 14 pWithout a UIVisualEffectView with vibrancy clicked buttons do get a little bit darker. However this does not work, when vibrancy turned on. Any way to do thisp  pstrongEditstrongp  pIt gets darker, when the UIButton only contains text. What I do is I use a background image for the UIButton. So I need the background image to get darker. I know this is possible by creating a second background image which is a bit darker. Then you could create an IBAction, where the background gets changed when the user presses down the button. But the image doesnt get changed when clicking really fast on the button.p  pThis happens for backgroundColorp  precodeIBAction func plusPressedsender UIButton      plusButton.backgroundColor  UIColorred 119.0255.0, green 211.0255.0, blue 113.0255.0, alpha 1.0    IBAction func minusPressedsender UIButton      minusButton.backgroundColor  UIColorred 255.0255.0, green119.0255.0, blue 107.0255.0, alpha 1.0   codepre

Negative 14 pI am writing socket.ioclient node.js bot app in order to test performance of my socket.io based server application also running under node. p  pUsually the server runs ubuntu linux but I also have the same server app node.js, nginx, socket.io installed and configured on my local dev machine. p  pIf I start my botscript and launch 200 bots that create individual connections to the server I have no problem whatsoever if I do it to the real servers, the linux servers. p  pBut if I connect to my local os x based server I cannot really get over 120 connections. p  pI get disconnects, stale sockets, and an infinite loop of disconnectreconnect which under the standard settings of socket.io will just take longer and longer to complete delayed reconnection attempt. p  pMy local dev machine is under almost 0 load during such a test, so it is not related to memory or processor. p  pI have tried the same botscript from a second local machine, to ensure the issue was not related to the bots running on the same machine as the server. But I get the same issue. p  pAs soon as I point the botscript towards the real servers I have no issues whatsoever. p  pWhen I am in the range where the issue occurs, i.e. pushing with more than 120 clients, I have tried to access my local devserver with a browser the real userscenario and refresh many times. Sometimes I get a internal server 500. p  pMakes me think that maybe this is not socket.io related by rather nginx or some other basic socket limitation on a regular os x non server machine p

Negative 14 pWhen my iPhone is not available, my WatchKit app on the Apple Watch does not work a red crossedout iPhone symbol appears. How can I make my app work without the iPhone How do I tell it to use data that is cached on my Apple Watchp
Negative 14 pI know this is the wrong way to do it, but the lack of help from anyone has caused me to do this. I have drawn 7 circles each with a different radius in the same play each pausing for 300 miliseconds after being drawn so in theory it should look like the circle is expanding as its being drawn, but for some reason its not can someone tell me why or maybe answer this question that has caused me weeks of hardache. The app displays circles randomly on the screen either green or red. When it displays a circle it really should display 7 circles instead it only displays the last one with a radius of 300.p  precodepublic class SplashLaunch extends View     Handler cool  new Handler

Negative 14 pI am trying to get this form to populate the checkboxes from the database when showing the form. I have been searching and trying for days, and I can not find an answer.p  pEach Area has many Tools, connected in a pivot table codeareatoolcode.p  pEach template has many areas, connected by a pivot table named codetempareacode, with the fields codeidcode, codeareaidcode and codetemplateidcode. p  pEach area in a specific template can have many tools, connected by a pivot table named codetempareatoolcode, with the fields codetempareaidcode and codetoolidcode. p  pBy using this form and my controller functions I have been able to generate a checkbox for all tools connected to a specific area, and to sync those tools in codetempareatoolcode. p  pHowever, I am very unsure of how I can get the form to populate the checkboxes to show which tools have already been chosen for this specific temparea. What I need is to get to pass codetoolidcode from the codetempareatoolcode for this specific temparea as the third argument in the formfield. p  pEDIT  After a lot of more hours, I have now somehow managed to generate an array that I can pass to the view, where the array key is the template area and the array value is an array of toolids selected for this template area. The array can look like thisp  precodearray9 [  15 gt array2 [       0 gt 1       1 gt 4  16 gt 4  45 gt array2 []  47 gt 4  38 gt 5  48 gt 4  49 gt 4  50 gt array2 []  51 gt 4 ] codepre  pSo I need a way to use this array or some other way to populate these checkboxes when the form is loaded. p  pTherefore I figure as the third parameter to the checkboxfield I need to check if array has a key with value areapivotid and if this key contains value toolid. As you can see the array is a multidimensional array. I do not now if this can be done or the syntax for it. Would appreciate help.p  pTHE FORMp  precode Formmodeltemplate, arrayroute gt arraytemptoolupdate, templategtid, method gt put   Formhiddentempid, templategtid  ltulgt   foreach templategtarea as area   ltligt     areagttitle   ltligt    ltulgt     foreach areagttool as tool     ltligt       toolgttitle       ltdiv classformgroupgt          Formcheckboxtemparea .

Negative 14 pToday I upgraded to XCode 6.3.2.  I have a single XCode project that generates a number of different apps.  Each app is a different compile target.  All apps use the same core data model. There are 4 versions of the core data model.  The lastest one is the current one. The core data model has been used to autogenerate ObjectiveC entity classes.  Those entity classes are included in each of the different compile targets. The app has no Swift code in it.  Everything is implemented in ObjectiveC.p  pThe apps still compile and begin to execute.  However, they crash as soon as the core data system gets loaded.

Negative 14 pI am looking for a Hook allowing me to tellinstruct the ServerConnector or whatever other object in the Jetty architecture that would be a more suitable hookpoint NOT to accept an incoming TCPIP connection on the Web Server ports eg 80 or 443 based on the IP address of the remote party because that is all the info there is available before accept is called and before, LATER after accept, the HTTP data becomes available from the TCPIP frames payload.p  pThe idea is that I would attach a peace of software to that hook that for each incoming connection can say  AcceptRevoke. With revoke the incoming connection would be IGNORED and the socket would stay closed avoiding the Jetty container to do more workuse resources on it.p  pIt would also make it possible to protect system features eg. special admin menu after certain server ports by only accepting, for example, local addresses 10.32...., etc. It would have been even nicer to ALSO be able to get to the MAC address of the connecting  device and only allow access if the MAC address is in an authorisation list the user had physical access to the LAN to connect his device or else his MAC address would never be the one that is seen on the LAN because there is no peer to peer MAC address exchange if not on the same LAN.p  pIn this way I intend to prevent hostile connections to consume CPU, bandwidth and sockets just to send them the main pages during attacks and force them into waiting for timeouts. At the same time it would additionally allow to protect access to non public features based on physical local access. The hook software could even revoke connections on parts of the IP address, for instance the Chinese IP address range, etc.p  pI found the typical TCPIP socket interface on the ServerConnector classes opencloseaccept... but I didnt find a place where I could register for a preaccept hook or callback.

Negative 14 pIm currently using regular expressions to manipulate street names in Stata. Im faced with a problem that requires me to select observations based on how long a certain word is in the string. I know that you can specify the iteration of expressions using curved brackets in other engines, but this doesnt seem to be working in Stata. Specifically, I want to select observations that have three or more alpha numeric characters in a certain point in the string, which should be coded byp  precode[azAZ09]3, codepre  pHowever, this doesnt work when I try it in Stata, nor do any other uses of  work, even though online debuggers say it should be correct. Is this a deficiency in the Stata implementation of regex Im working on a solution that doesnt need that iteration, but Id like to hear from the community on what is lacking in regex in Stata, and if theres a different way to iterate expressions in the program.p

Negative 14 pSo I wanted to try using DirectXTKs spritefont class and after including all of the needed files I end up with an error poping up as the program is about to start, telling me that The procedure entrypoint CreateFile2 could not be located in the kernel32.dll. Now I have searched around for the problem and from what I can tell it seems the directxtk is trying to use windows 8 specific things or possibly 8.1 I guess while I am using windows 7. The general fix that people seem to suggest is to change what kind of version is used by definingp  precodedefine WINVER 0x0601 define WIN32WINNT 0x601 codepre  pto make it use the windows 7 version.

Negative 14 pIve been kicking around the idea of lowcost, lowlatency HD video streaming over WIFI or LAN for the past few weeks, and would love some input on what strategies can be used to minimize latency in digital video transmission.p  pThe idea is to design a low power, fairly low cost video transmitter and receiver hardware set to broadcast video over a WIFI bridge. This has been implemented by others with a few Raspberry Pis and GStreamer, with latency as low as 250ms.p  pMy question is, what is the absolute minimum latency achievable over such a connection Commercial units such as the Connex HD downlink achieve negligible latency, but clearly use sophisticated hardware to do so. p  pIf I stick to H.264 compression and use a hardware encoder and decoder chip, with minimal buffering, how low can latency be Im not afraid to get a few custom PCBs made, or write the required code, but want to get some idea of the theoretical minimum latency for H.264 encodingdecoding is before I start.p

Negative 14 pWhat Microsoft Edge is doing, at least from what I can see, is that any external javascriptie javascript from any other FQDN that is different from the websites is being sandboxed to an extent.p  pIm not sure how much it is being sandboxed, but Edge will not let you see function code.

Where this gets to be a problem is with Prototype. For subclasses, prototype does a toString of a function to see if it has super as its first argument. If it does, then it knows to link that with a parent classs function. If prototype cant see a text version of the function, any subclasses will not work correctly.p  pThere are no security settings in Edge that can be changed.p  pDoes anyone know any workaround or do we just have to wait and see if Microsoft will fix thisp  pUPDATEp  pI just confirmed that the latest a hrefhttpssupport.microsoft.comenuskb3081438 relnofollowWindows 10 Cumulative Updatea has fixed the issue.

Negative 14 pI have a map Ive made using spplot, and I would like to add a bitmap graphic to the corner of the graphic, within the boundaries of the plot.  I am using grid.raster to add the graphic, and I believe I need to use grconverX and grcovertY.  However, I am really confused about all of the coordinate systems.  p  pAccording to a hrefhttpsstat.ethz.chRmanualRdevellibrarygraphicshtmlconvertXY.html relnofollowthisa documentation, ConvertXY can convert between user coordinates user, inches inches, the device coordinate system device, normalized device coordinates ndc, normalized figure coordinates nfc, normalized plot coordinates npc and normalized inner region coordinates nic.  There are also a lot of possible unitscoordinate systems given in a hrefhttpsstat.ethz.chRmanualRdevellibrarygridhtmlunit.html relnofollowthe documentation for unit objectsa, which I need for grid.raster, and none of them match with the coordinate systems given in convertXY  The only exception is npc, although this stands for Normalized plot coordinates in ConvertXY and Normalized Parent Coordinates in Units, so it is unclear if they are the same.  p  pWhat do all of these different coordinate systems refer to, and which ones should I be using to anchor a small bitmap to the boundaries of my plotp

Negative 14 pIm pondering the merits of moving codeUITableViewDataSourcecode method implementations out from the codeUIViewControllercode subclass and into its own class to counter the ema hrefhttpprogrammers.stackexchange.comquestions267213massiveviewcontrolleriossolutionsmassive view controllera tendencyem of iOS development.p  pThe thinking is to move logic out of the view controller into an eminputem controllerhelper e.g. codeUITableViewDelegatecode implementation class and an emoutputem controllerhelper e.g. codeUITableViewDataSourcecode implementation class. Then the view controllers responsibility is primarily for object ownership and managing navigation between view controller instances.p  pIn this paradigm codeUITableViewDataSourcecode implementation class drives the emoutputem of the program by vending out codeUITableViewCellcode instances. Thus it is supposed to know all there is about the data being displayed and how to display it like picking the appropriate table view cell class and configuring it.p  pFurthermore codeUITableViewDelegatecode implementation class is more towards managing the eminputem from the user, e.g. codedidSelectRowAtIndexPathcode, etc. All seems to be good so far.p  pHowever several methods of codeUITableViewDelegatecode seems to be more appropriate to be present in  codeUITableViewDataSourcecode because it relates to view configurationp  ul licode... heightForRowAtIndexPathcodeli licode... indentationLevelForRowAtIndexPathcodeli licode... willDisplayCell forRowAtIndexPathcodeli ul  pIm wondering whats the reasoning between splitting data sources and delegates and how is the best way to split these inputoutput logicp

Negative 14 pI have a DatePickerDialog that launches successfully in a fragment. When an orientation change occurs the app crashes. The logcat output says the NPE happens with onDismiss in the DatePickerFragment. The onDismiss code is used to toggle the soft keyboard to show again after the launch of the DatePickerDialog toggles it off.  The InputMethodManager to launch the soft keyboard uses getActivity reference which I think is causing the crash after orientation since the Activity is recreated.  Can I replace that with a reference to the Fragment using findFragmentByTag as a way to reuse the dialogfragment upon orientation changep  pHere is partial DatePickerFragement filep  precodepublic class DatePickerFragment extends DialogFragment implements DatePickerDialog.OnDateSetListener   public DatePickerFragment    Override public Dialog onCreateDialogBundle savedInstanceState  ...
