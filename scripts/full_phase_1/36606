Positive 36606 pI am relatively new to ggplot2 and was wondering if there was a simple way to change legend plots.

Essentially, it uses codemincode and codemaxcode of its columns to call codeexpand.gridcode, like in the followingp  precodegridded.prediction lt functiondf, model      grid.glm lt expand.gridhdseqfrommindfcol1, tomaxdfcol1, length.out100,                         cntseqfrommindfcol2, tomaxdfcol2, length.out100       grid.glmprediction lt predictmodel, newdatagrid.glm, typeresponse     grid.glm  codepre  pGenerally these plots produce 2d hexbin histogram with some contour lines overplotted, like in the fragment belowp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comwWcnE.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwWcnE.png altenter image description hereap  pHere, hexagonal grid is produced by codegeomhexcode from codehd.ngcode data frame, and contour lines  by codegeomcontourcode, but from another data frame, derived from limits of codehd.ngcode.p  pAs far as I understand, codegeomcontourcode already knows the underlying data frame, that has been used to produce codeplot.ngcode. How can I make it to pass to the codegridded.predictioncode either that data frame, or, preferably min and max values from codecol1code and codecol2codep

Positive 36606 pMy dataset consists of 36 sites with 12 x 3 sites being a replicate triplet. The dataset has two series R and D. Some R and D  triples relate to each other, indicated by the numerical index after the letter So, the Series R2i and D2i belong together, R3i and D3i and so on. As a twist R7i and R1i have no equivalent in the D world.

Negative 36606 pIm trying to determine the reason for a stalled process on Linux.  Its a telecom application, running under fairly heavy load.  There is a separate process for each of 8 T1 spans.  Every so often, one of the processes will get very unresponsive  up to maybe 50 seconds before an event is noted in the normally very busy processs log.p  pIt is likely some system resource that runs short.  The obvious thing  CPU usage  looks to be OK.  p  pWhich linux utilities might be best for catching and analyzing this sort of thing, and be as unobtrusive about it as possible, as this is a highly loaded system  It would need to be processes rather than system oriented, it would seem.

Negative 36606 pWe have a layered application, or at least is in the process of transitioning to one, broken down as followsp  ul liInterface userinterface or applicationinterface, ie. webservice, etc.li liBusiness logicli liData accessli ul  pTo make the rest of this question more concrete, Ill describe a specific instance.p  pWe have a user interface, which has a controller object behind it the business logic layer. This controller talks to the database through another object the data access layer.p  pIn a given context, the user interface allows the user to pick an employee to tie the operation being done to. Since there are rules regarding which employees the user well, any world outside of the controller really can pick, the controller provides two things for thisp  ul lia readable property containing a list of available employees to choose fromli lia readwritable property containing the currently chosen employeeli ul  pThe user interface might read the list and use it to populate a combobox.p  pIn version 1 of this application, the combobox contains the identifying number of the employee  the name of the employee.p  pAll is well...p  p... until version 1.1, a bugfix. A user complains that he cant choose between emJimmy Olsonem and emJimmy Olsonem because the application doesnt make it easy enough for him to know which is which. He knows there is one Jimmy in the sales department, and another in the development department, so the fix for this 1.1 version is to simply tack on a slash  the department name in the combobox. In version 2 we would opt for replacing the combobox with a combobox that has column support, removing the slash, but in 1.1, this is what is chosen in order to minimize the risk of further bugs.p  pIn other words, the combobox would containp  ul li1  Jimmy OlsonSalesli li2  Jimmy OlsonDevelopmentli liul liother peopleli ulli ul  pHowever, the user interface code has no SQL code, or any way to get hold of that department, and thus we have to go to the controller and look at the code there. The controller doesnt need the department, and to be honest, it doesnt even need the name of the employee, the identifying number is enough, so there is nothing in the controller that asks for or does anything to the department. So we have to go down to the data access layer and change the SQL there.p  pThis solution quite frankly smells.p  pIf there are multiple interfaces to this controller, with different requirements, we have three possible solutionsp  ol liChange the data access layer to cater for the increasingdiverse needs of multiple interfaces 2 layers away, which means that all the interfaces will possibly get all the data they need, but they would also get all the data required for any of the other interfacesli liAdd something that lets the user interface tell the data access layer still 2 layers away what it needsli liSomehow make the user interface layer get hold of the required data without changing either the controller or access layer involved, this sounds like we need more data access code, somewhere.li ol  pNone of the above solutions feel good.p  pWhat Im wondering is, are we completely off course How would you do this Are there a fourth and fifth solution below the 3 abovep  pPer this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions98734separationofconcernsSeparation of Concernsa, the accepted answer contains this quotep  blockquote   pThe separation of concerns is keeping the code for each of these concerns separate. Changing the interface should not require changing the business logic code, and vice versa.p blockquote  pDoes this simply mean that all the controllerdata access layer should provide us with is whatever it needs to do its job ie. the identifying numbers o

Negative 36606 pMy problem is to compute codegx mod pcode quickly in JavaScript, where codecode is exponentiation, codemodcode is the modulo operation. All inputs are nonnegative integers, codexcode has about 256 bits, and codepcode is a prime number of 2048 bits, and codegcode may have up to 2048 bits.p  pMost of the software Ive found that can do this in JavaScript seems to use the JavaScript BigInt library a hrefhttpwww.leemon.comcryptoBigInt.htmlhttpwww.leemon.comcryptoBigInt.htmla. Doing a single exponentiation of such size with this library takes about 9 seconds on my slow browser Firefox 3.0 with SpiderMonkey. Im looking for a solution which is at least 10 times faster. The obvious idea of using squareandmultiply exponentiation by squaring, a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiExponentiation5Fby5Fsquaringhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiExponentiationbysquaringa is too slow for 2048bit numbers it needs up to 4096 multiplications.p  pUpgrading the browser is not an option. Using another programming language is not an option. Sending the numbers to a web service is not an option.p  pIs there a faster alternative implementedp  pUpdate By doing some extra preparations i.e. precomputing a few hundred powers as recommended by the article a hrefhttpwww.ccrwest.orggordonfast.pdfhttpwww.ccrwest.orggordonfast.pdfa mentioned in outis answer below, it is possible do to a 2048bit modular exponentiation using only at most 354 modular multiplications. The traditional squareandmultiply method is much slower it uses maximum 4096 modular multiplications. Doing so speeds up the modular exponentiation by a factor of 6 in Firefox 3.0, and by a factor of 4 in Google Chrome. The reason why we are not getting the full speedup of 4096354 is that BigInts modular exponentation algorithm is already faster than squareandmultiply, because it uses Montgomery reduction a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMontgomery5Freductionhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMontgomeryreductiona.p  pUpdate Starting from BigInts code, it seems worthwhile doing two levels of handoptimized and inlined Karatsuba multiplication a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiKaratsuba5Falgorithmhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiKaratsubaalgorithma, and only then revert to the base32768 On2 multiplication implemented in BigInt. This speeds up multiplications by a factor of 2.25 for 2048bit integers. Unfortunately, the modulo operation does not become faster.p  pUpdate Using the modified Barrett reduction defined in a hrefhttpwww.lirmm.frarith18papershasenplaughFastModularReduction.pdfhttpwww.lirmm.frarith18papershasenplaughFastModularReduction.pdfa and Karatsuba multiplication and precomputing powers as defined in a hrefhttpwww.ccrwest.orggordonfast.pdfhttpwww.ccrwest.orggordonfast.pdfa, I can get down the time needed for a single multiplication from 73 seconds to 12.3 seconds in Firefox 3.0. This seems to be the best I can do, but it is still too slow.p  pUpdate The ActionScript 2 AS2 interpreter in the Flash Player isnt worth using, because it seems to be slower than the JavaScript interpreter in Firefox 3.0 for Flash Player 9, it seems to be 4.2 times slower, and for Flash Player 10, it seems to be 2.35 times slower. Does anybody know the speed difference between ActionScript2 and ActionScript3 AS3 for number chrunchingp  pUpdate The ActionScript 3 AS3 interpreter in Flash Player 9 isnt worth using because it has just about the same speed as the JavaScript int Firefox 3.0.p  pUpdate The ActionScript 3 AS3 interpreter in Flash Player 10 can be up to 6.5 times faster than the JavaScript interpreter in Firefox 3.0 if codeintcode is used instead of codeNumbercode, and codeVector.ltintgtcode is used instead of codeArraycode. At least it was 2.41 times faster for 2048bit big integer multiplication. So it might be worth doing the modular exponentiation in AS3, executing it in Flash Player 10 if available. Please note that this is still slower than V8, the JavaScript interpreter of Google Chrome. See a hrefhttpptspts.blogspot.com200910javascriptandactionscriptperformance.htmlhttpptspts.blogspot.com200910javascriptandactionscriptperformance.htmla for a speed comparison of various programming language and JavaScript implementations.p  pUpdate There is a very fast Java solution, which can be called from the browsers JavaScript if the Java plugin is installed. The following solution is about 310 times faster than the pure JavaScript implementation using BigInt.p  precodeltbodygthi0 ltscript typetextjavascriptgt document.body.innerHTML  ltbrgthi1 if objecttypeof java    var x  new java.math.BigInteger123456789123456789, 10   var p  new java.math.BigInteger234567891234567891, 10   var g  new java.math.BigInteger3, 10   var v  x.modPowx, p   document.body.innerHTML  ltbrgt  v.toString   document.body.innerHTML  ltbrgt  v.toString16  else    document.body.innerHTML  ltbrgtjava plugin not installed  ltscriptgtltbodygt codepre  pCan anyone translate this code to Silverlight Cp

Negative 36606 pIts not a real programming coding  problem, sorry for that but design comes first. But anyway I dont understand whats the difference between disjoint and overlapping, it occured in several books, has a relation to OCL which is considered to be part of UML but the lastest OCL specification by OMG does no longer mention these terms, therefore it appears somewhat diffuse to me. I would greatly appreciate if someone could clearify whats behind this. Is it simply multiple inherintance of the same superclassp

Negative 36606 pThis might be a shot in the dark, but, how would I go about setting a breakpoint inside the following internal static method in PresentationFramework.dllp  precodeSystem.Windows.Documents.TextEditorTyping.ShowCursor codepre  pIve run into a very similar situation to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1734858autocompletetextboxandhidepointerwhiletypinginwindowsJoea, where I am making a custom autocomplete textbox using a TextBox control and a Popup which contains an ItemsControl. When I have the focus in the text box and the popup shown with StaysOpenFalse, and type some characters, the mouse pointer is hidden through a call to  System.Windows.Documents.TextEditorTyping.HideCursor I believe. It is normally reshown on mouse move, however it appears that the popup handles this event while it is checking whether it should hide or not, so the pointer stays hidden as you move it around the window.p  pThere is a quirk, where on the first key press, the pointer disappears then instantly reappears, then on the second key press, the pointer stays hidden. This suggests that something is calling ShowCursor, and I am interested to know what. Hence this post, and the desire to set the breakpoint described above. How do I set that breakpointp  pRegarding my actual problem, the pointer staying hidden once it moves, I hope to solve it either by emulating StaysOpenFalse myself without blocking mouse move events, or to fire mouse move events myself to cause the pointer to reappear. Any other tips on this appreciated.p

Negative 36606 pIm writing an ASP.NET app. I need to include a page where the user can add an item which has several sets of subitems, each of which sets is unlimited in number. The subitems themselves contain between 10 and 15 fields, so need a fair bit of UI space.p  pAs an example of what I mean, the user needs to be able to add a Business record to the system, including any number of Employee records and any number of Asset records.p  pThe way I normally do this is by using a MultiView control with a set of tabs at the top. The tabs switch between the Views of the MultiView. The first tab will be for the Business record, the second will be for Employee records, and the third for Asset records. The Views for Employees and Assets are initially empty bar a button to add a new Employee or Asset. When this button is clicked, the page is posted back and a user control is added dynamically to capture the details of the Employee or Asset.p  pThere is one save button that saves the whole object graph to the database.p  pThis is quite complicated to program and maintain and I usually encounter headaches to do with managing ViewState for the dynamic user controls. Obviously, the ViewState on the page can also become quite large, making the page quite slow.p  pThe advantage is that it is quite an intuitive UI for the user to understand, and the user can add everything and check it all before saving anything to the database.p  pCan you please suggest any other UI patterns that you might use for this and any advantages or disadvantagesp  pThanksp  pDavidp

In the receiving script, I would like to use data stored in the session, however because uploadify sends files to the script using flash it doesnt send the session cookie.br The workaround for this problem is to get uploadify to GET or POST the session id to the script, however Im finding this very unreliable. In my script I have the followingp  precodeltphp inisetsession.useonlycookies, FALSE inisetsession.usetranssid, TRUE sessionnameSESSNAME sessionstart printrSESSION codepre  pThe script url is something like script.phpSESSNAMEemsessionidem and I have tried using transparent session ids as above and also manually setting the id using sessionidGET[SESSNAME].p  pThis emalwaysem works when accessing the script directly with the browser and sending the current session id along, even if I manually delete the session cookie.  It also always works with uploadify on my local server.  However when using uploadify on the remote server, it works about 20 of the time, completely randomly.  There is no pattern.  It seemed to work with greater frequency when I addedp  precodeinisetsession.gcprobability, 1 inisetsession.gcdivisor, 1 codepre  pto the script, however this may have been just coincidence.p  pAny ideasp  pLocal server info hxxpwww.dur.ac.ukn.r.brookinfolocal.phpbr Remote server info hxxpwww.dur.ac.ukn.r.brookinfo.phpbr sorry for hxxp, dont have the privileges to post multiple linksp  hr  h2Some speculation...h2  pDoing some digging around and looking at the headers the script is receiving, I think I may have determined the issue.br You need to send the session id when using uploadify because flash does not send cookies when using the FileReference.upload I think method.  However, as well as the session id, in load balanced environments such as the remote server there is also the BALANCEID cookie which determines which server the user is currently working with.  Flash doesnt send this cookie so the load balancer sometimes sends the request to a different server, and on this server the session does not exist.p  pI have tested this behaviour by setting a session variable after I have printed the session.  Doing this and repeatedly sending files exhibits the issue  at first I get an empty array, but a few repeats in the variable starts appearing.p  pSo, if the above is all true, then my question is what can I do to get flash to send this data with the upload so the load balancer knows which server to use  Or is this a lost causep  hr  h2The answerh2  pAfter further research, I found the following post  hxxpswfupload.orgforumgeneraldiscussion977br This suggests there is no way cookies can be sent with FileReference.upload and therefore uploadify cannot be used with load balanced servers if you want to use session data.  However, I think I will now attempt a solution which saves data linked to the session id to a file.  The uploadify receiving script can open this file and pull out the required data.br This is my first experience working with anything Flash based, it has not improved my opinion of the technologyp

Negative 36606 pIm sure that this is a pretty vague question that is difficult to answer but I would be grateful for any general thoughts on the subject.p  pLet me give you a quick background.p  pA decade ago, we used to write data loads reading input flat files from legacy applications and load them into our Datamart. Originally, our load programs were written in VB6 and cursored through the flat file and for each record, performed this general processp  p1 Look up the record. If found, update it 2 else insert new recordp  pThen we ended up changing this process to use SQL Server to DTS the flat file in a temp table and then we would perform a massive set base join on the temp table with the target production table, taking the data from the temp table and using it to update the target table. Records that didnt join were inserted.p  pThis is a simplification of the process, but essentially, the process went from an iterative approach to set based, no longer performing updates 1 record at a time. As a result, we got huge performance gains.p  pThen we created what was in my opinion a powerful set of shared functions in a DLL to perform common functionsupdate patterns using this approach. It greatly abstracted the development and really cut down on the development time.p  pThen Informatica PowerCenter, an ETL tool, came around and mgt wants to standardize on the tool and rewrite the old VB loads that used DTS.p  pI heard that PowerCenter processes records iteratively, but I know that it does do some optimization tricks, so I am curious how Informatica would perform. p  pDoes anyone have any experience with using DTS or SSIS to be able to make a gut performance predition as to which would generally perform betterp

Negative 36606 pXcode 4 is giving me rather unhelpful errors about unimplemented selector xxx when I try to use selectorxxx with any method not actually defined in the same source file. The error goes away at least for the project build if I set the LLVM compiler warning, Multiple Definition Types for Selector to No. This is the iOS default, but for my project it had been enabled. strikeHowever, even with this off, the error still shows up in the editor if Enable live issues is checked in the Build Settings dialog.strikep  pSo now Ive turned off live issues so as not to be distracted, which is a bit of a let down. My question is Is there a way I can get rid of the error by, perhaps, specifying which definition of a selector I want to use Or should it even matter, i.e. do all definitions of a method share the same selector in ObjectiveC Is this a compiler bug, or perhaps a bogus setting that I should just leave off strikeAnd if the latter, why is it on for the live build feature in the new editorstrikep  pHeres the code, just to be clearp  precodeif [recognizer respondsToSelectorselectortranslationInView]  ...  codepre  pAnd heres the errorp  precodeerror unimplemented selector translationInView [Wselector,2]      if [recognizer respondsToSelectorselectortranslationInView]                                            codepre  pIf I replace translationInView with a method defined in the same source file, theres no error.

Negative 36606 pI want to extend python and numpy by writing some modules in C or C, using BLAS and LAPACK. I also want to be able to distribute the code as standalone CC libraries. I would like this libraries to use both single and double precision float. Some examples of functions I will write are conjugate gradient for solving linear systems or accelerated first order methods. Some functions will need to call a Python function from the CC code.p  pAfter playing a little with the PythonC API and the NumpyC API, I discovered that many people advocate the use of Cython instead see for example a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4320133extendingnumpywithcfunctionthis questiona or a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1942298wrappingaclibraryinpythonccythonorctypesthis onea. I am not an expert about Cython, but it seems that for a hrefhttpwiki.cython.orgtutorialsnumpyUsingtheNumpyCAPIsome casesa, you still need to use the NumpyC API and know how it works. Given the fact that I already have some little knowledge about the PythonC API and none about Cython, I was wondering if it makes sense to keep on using the PythonC API, and if using this API has some advantages over Cython. In the future, I will certainly develop some stuff not involving numerical computing, so this question is not only about numpy. One of the thing I like about the PythonC API is the fact that I learn some stuff about how the Python interpreter is working.p  pThanks.p

Negative 36606 pI am writing an application a server wrapper for Minecraft that I wish to make extensible with plugins. I have a system in place that works, however I think that in the long run it could use improvement. p  pThe way that I have it now, the application calls a getplugins method in the server class that, first imports a file named pluginutils.py pluginutils.py defines a BasePlugin class which all plugins subclass, and then loops through every .py file in the strongcmdsstrong directory, importing it and checking to see if it is a subclass of BasePlugin. If it is, it stores an instance of it in a dictionary, for which the key is a emcmdem class variable defined in the plugin. Whenever the application receives a command from the server it checks if it is a key in the dictionary and if so runs the start method of the instance stored in the dictionary, to which it passes the necessary arguments taken from the command.p  pWhile this works, I feel like this is a sloppy way to do it. Are there any better techniques for implementing a system similar to this I want to write this myself I dont want to use anything like zope.interface as this is a learning experience. Thanks.p

This class was probably produced by a [apply] compiler that did not target the modern .class file format. The recommended [apply] solution is to recompile the class from source, using an uptodate compiler [apply] and without specifying any target type options. The consequence of ignoring [apply] this warning is that reflective operations on this class will incorrectly [apply] indicate that it is not an inner class. codepre  p... or maybe not ...p  pstrongEDIT3strong Finally, in spite of dealing with many other bugs and problems such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5701126compilewithproguardgivesunexpectedtoplevelexceptionthe SimException buga, Ive been able to get it working in some limited cases. That way I could pinpoint it to the obfuscation step. That is, at least, if I add dontobfuscate, the problem goes away. it isnt the first time Im playing with that, so it must be the workarounds for the other problems, or the narrower configuration, that alleviates this problem as well. So heres me asking again When Ive already safeguarded the main parts of xstream and my model classes from obfuscation using keep, then what else could be creating this messp  pIf you need more info, let me know. p

Negative 36606 pUsing cwpf I wish to bind a raddatagrid to viewmodels, where each rowviewmodel should respond to binding names received from outside my system. The rowviewmodel holds a dictionary of the values to display in grid.p  pCreating the columns dynamically and binding them to appropriate named properties is not a problem. But how can the viewmodel respond to databindings not known at compiletimep  pExample All rowviewmodels have each a dictionary, where the strings v1 and v2 are each mapped to a value. I create the columns mapped to rowviewmodel properties v1 and v2. Normally, the viewmodel would then expose properties v1 and v2, but since the final list of possible names are not known at compile time, I cant.p  pIm thinking that some magical reflection might be used, but it might be the wrong tool And I know nothing about refelction...p  pOr could I somehow intercept the binding call so I could make a custom call to viewmodel with appropriate parameterp  pAny input is appreciatedp  pThanks, Anders, Denmarkp

Negative 36606 pIm trying to write an application to display multiple video streams, all updating at 25 or 30 images per second.  The images are being rendered into WPF controls using Direct3D and some Interop to avoid using a Winforms control.  As more video streams are added, the frame rate of each control drops yet the CPU on my machine only ever reaches about 50.  p  pUsing the Microsoft WPF Performance Suite  Perforator tool, it would appear that when the frame rate on the video streams starts to drop, the Dirty Rect Addition Rate levels out like it has reached a maximum for the video card. There is no software rendering activity in the application so it would appear that overall performance is being limited by the graphics cards ability to update the Dirty Rectangles.p  pTherefore, is there a feature or performance parameter that can be used to determine the best video card to buy in order to maximise performance for my application Either that, or is there a set of graphics cards settings that will boost performance Currently running with an ATI FirePro V4800 that will happily run 16 streams of H264 video at a resolution of 4CIF but looking for the ability to run up to 32.p

Negative 36606 pIm trying to create a simple shell program in C. What I need it to do is provide the user with a prompt in which they can run other local programs. I can do that part fine, using a fork in which the parent process waits on the child,and the child execvps the program.p  pHowever, if the amp character is appended to the end of the users command, I need their program to run in the background, meaning I need the parent to NOT wait on the child process but instead immediately return the prompt to the user, while allowing the background process to continue to run, bbut not allowing it to display anything on the screen. I just want to be able to check that it still exists via ps command.p  pI tried to understand the idea behind using fork to create a child, then have the child fork again to create a grandchild of sorts, then immediately exiting the child process. i.e., orphan the grandchild. Supposedly this allows the parent to still wait on the child, but since the child effectually ends almost immediately, its like it doesnt wait at all  Something about zombie madness I dont know. Several sites Ive come across seem to recommend this as a way to run a process in the background. p  pHowever, when I try to do this, I get wild things happening with the flow of the program, the background process continues to display input on the screen, and Im really not sure where to go from here.p  pThis is my implementation of the code, which Im sure is quite wrong. Im just wondering if this whole grandchild thing is even the route I need to take,and if so, whats wrong with my code p  precode36 int mainint argc, char argv[] 37  38     char buffer[512] 39     char args[16] 40     int background 41     int status 42     sizet argct 43     pidt pid 44  45     while1 46      47         printfgt  48         fgetsbuffer, 512, stdin 49         parseargsbuffer, args, 16, ampargct 50  51         if argct  0 continue 52  53         if strcmpargs[0], exit 54          55             exit0 56          57  58         pid  fork  here I fork and create a child process 61  62         if pid ampamp background  i.e. if its the parent process and dont need to run in the background this is the part that seems to work 63          64             printfWaiting on child d.n, pid 65             pid  waitstatus 66             printfChild d finished.n, pid 67          68         else 69          70             if background ampamp pid  0  if its a child process and i need to run the command in background 71                 72                 pid  fork fork child and create a grandchild 73                 if pid exit0 exit child and orphan grandchild 74                  75                 execvpargs[0], args orphan execs the command then exits 76                 exit1 77  78              else exit0 79          80      81     return 0 82  codepre  pP.S.

When I change the image name to other images in the assetsimages folder it works just fine. I cant figure it out. I assume I am missing something rather remedial about the asset pipeline but at this point I have tried everything I can think of and nothing is working. I have restarted the server, restarted both terminal and textmate but no luck. This broken image is killing me Also, the image is not inheriting the class that I tell it to take even when I aim it at another image that works. So it isnt displaying with some images and it isnt recognizing its class when it works with other images. p  pIt has been quite the roadblock today. Any help would be appreciated. A quick little explanation of when these images get compiledwhen I need to restart stuff would help also. This image will be a static image on the home page. Is this the best place to put it I read in the guides that the public folder might be a better spot because then it will be cached. p  pThanks in advance. p  pEDIT I just went into publicassets and dropped the file in there and it worked like a charm. Can someone explain to me why this is the case with the asset pipeline I am baffled but grateful it is working.p
Negative 36606 pSo, I currently have a GridView class, which is essentially what it sounds like. It is a subclass of UIView that has a staging area that has a bunch of subviews placed in a gridlike manner. Each cell of the GridView is a custom UIView subclass which calls drawRect.p  pI implemented lazy loading by following the UITableView pattern.  I only loaded and added the grid cells which were visible  2 cells on each side.  As the view is scrolled through, I cache cells that are no longer visible in a NSMutableSet and also reuse cells from that Set to build the cells that are now visible.  Everything about that seems to work fine, as I have tested and profiled it, with no memory leaks.p  pThe problem is that scrolling is too slow  jerky.  The faster the user scrolls, the jerkier it is.  Sometimes, if you scroll very fast, it throws a memory warning.  After some debugging work, I found when it starts freezing and jerking, the subviews in the gridview dont get removed, like they shouldp  pI also noticed that the scrolling is significantly slower on the iPad 1 vs. the iPad 2.  p  pMy questions is, does anyone have any ideas on how to handle this  Any tricks or optimizations to stop the jerkyness of the scrolling Anything would help at this point, as I have been trying to figure this out for 2 days.  Thanks in advancep

Negative 36606 pAndroid has the ability to handle various device sizes by using the Fragment Classes.  If the activity contains a ListView and then a details activity about the item selected in the ListView, on a phone the ListView would use the available space then start the second details activity.  On a tablet, both the ListView and the details activity could be visible at the same time to prevent the entire screen from being filled with the ListView and then a second activity containing the Details about that item.p  pIs there an equivalent methodology if I wanted to use AIR for AndroidiOS to achieve the same native outcome on various devices  My thinking is that I would need to create a new layout manager that would be responsible for managing which Views are available depending on the screen size, but where I am stuck is trying to figure out at which proportions the views would switch from a single to a double view. Has anyone tried this approach before  What words of wisdom can you offerp

Negative 36606 pi got a problem getting my codeAsyncTaskcode to work correct. My App offers the possibility to connect with your Google Account and add and receive tasks by using the Tasks API.

Negative 36606 pI am wanting to use a JTable but with a different cell selection method rather than clicking in the cells.  I am using the glasspane to allow users to draw a rectangle and am discovering what cells are contained in the rectangle to select.  But I am only wanting to select a cell if it is totally within the rectangle.  For example, imagine a simple 3 x 3 table.  The user my want to select the middle cell 1,1.  I want them to be able to click in the first cell 0,0 and drag down to cell 2,2 drawing the rectangle for selection.  But I dont want cells 0,0 or 2,2 selected.  Or get all 9 selected, for that matter.  This is a simplified example.  Drawing the rectangle might actually encompass cells from more than one table on the screen.p  pI looked into implementing the ListSelectionModel interface, but dont really want to try and rewrite that.  While experimenting I saw that setSelectionInterval in the model was being called like crazy for every single mouse movement as I click and dragged around in the table.  What I would really like is to find a simple way to turn off whatever listenermechanism is on the table that makes the calls to the SelectionModel, while keeping the model in place.  Id still want it to report isSelectedIndex for example.  I would tell the model what intervals are selected.  p  pI figured that somewhere theres a mouse input adapter inherently built into JTables  Id like to turn it off if possible.p  pThanks, BBBp

Ive seen two patterns for passing functions as compile time arguments, and Im curious if compilers are usually smart enough to recognize the two are equivalent, or if Im asking too much. Heres the STL style, passing a functor objectp  precode  templateltclass InputIterator, class Predicategt   InputIterator findif  InputIterator first, InputIterator last, Predicate pred         for   firstlast  first  if  predfirst  break     return first    codepre  pAnd heres the alternative stylep  precode  templateltclass InputIterator, class Predicate, class PredDatagt   InputIterator findif  InputIterator first, InputIterator last, PredData data         for   firstlast  first  if  Predicateevalfirst, data  break     return first    codepre  pIn the STL style, your Predicate class typically contains as members any data it needs, and you call operator to evaluate the predicate. In the alternative style, you never have a Predicate object, rather it contains a static method that takes the item to be checked, and the data is passed as an argument rather than stored as a member on Predicate.p  pI have a few fears using the STL stylep  ol liIf Predicate is a word or smaller, will the compiler be smart enough to pass it by register In the alternative style the word would be an argument, so the compiler doesnt have to infer anything.li liIf Predicate is empty, will it be smart enough to avoid instantiating and passing it In the alternative style Predicate is never instantiated.li ol  pSo my intuition is the alternative style should be faster, but perhaps Im underestimating modern optimizers.p

Negative 36606 pIs there any way to get correct rounding with the i387 fsqrt instruction...p  p...strongaside from changing the precision modestrong in the x87 control word  I know thats possible, but its not a reasonable solution because it has nasty reentrancytype issues where the precision mode will be wrong if the sqrt operation is interrupted.p  pThe issue Im dealing with is as follows the x87 codefsqrtcode opcode performs a correctlyrounded per IEEE 754 square root operation in the precision of the fpu registers, which Ill assume is extended 80bit precision. However, I want to use it to implement efficient single and double precision square root functions with the results correctly rounded per the current rounding mode. Since the result has excess precision, the second step of converting the result to single or double precision rounds again, possibly leaving a notcorrectlyrounded result.p  pWith some operations its possible to work around this with biases. For instance, I can avoid excess precision in the results of addition by adding a bias in the form of a power of two that forces the 52 significant bits of a double precision value into the last 52 bits of the 63bit extendedprecision mantissa. But I dont see any obvious way to do such a trick with square root.p  pAny clever ideasp  pAlso tagged C because the intended application is implementation of the C codesqrtcode and codesqrtfcode functions.p

Should I use relative paths, absolute pathsp  pI have seen dirnamestrongFILEstrong mentioned several times.

Negative 36606 pI used to utilize MVC 3 Razor engine to render pages. Sometimes I had to use AJAX calls to transfer Razorrendered HTML and inserting it into the page using JQuery. As new project is starting, we do consider to utilize MVC 4 Single Page Application framework which is new to us. I took the first glance at it which left me with mixed feelings   On the one hand it implies all your data are transferred by JSON and client does all the job to render them and encode some UIrelated logic which is great for server and network performance. On the other hand the client HTMLJavaScript becomes much more heavy with a bunch of magic strings and hidden relations inside it which seems to be hard to maintain. We got used to VS intellisense, typesafed .NET server code to render pages which we have to exchange for client scripts and Knockout binding statements in case of SPA. p  pI wonder are any prons and cons of using SPA comparing to Razor, other that this obvious one Ive mentioned here Thanksp

Negative 36606 pIn a big system mvcbased there are views responsible for editing data and views that display that data.p  pExample codeUserManagementViewcode and codeUserSelectionViewcode.p  pEach subsystem should know whether it needs a data update, after another subsystem has made changes to the same data, in order for its controller to know whether a data update is needed.p  pMy thoughts on this is something like the observer pattern which is kinda integrated in c and all controllers would be listeners and eventually would get notified that datamanipulation occurred.p  pcodeBindingListltgtcode for example provides a codeListChangedcode event. Similarly, an interface can be created for each datastructure and notify the controller about the change. This would add overhead IMO and I find this solution difficult to maintain in a big system, also updating data anyways is not a solution.p  pWhich architectural design can help in this kind of scenariosp

Negative 36606 pI have an a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidappIntentService.htmlIntentServicea class that can be started from various places in a complex application  Activities, background Threads, other Services. Id like to keep a counter of how many times the service was invoked.

Negative 36606 pI am using install4j to install an intranet application which requires an HTTP and HTTPS port.  I would like to test that these ports are available and warn the userblock the installation until they select unavailable ports.  p  pThe only avenue I see for this besides custom code is to ensure the windows service fails if the application cannot bind to needed ports, and use a Failure Strategy Ask user whether to retry or quit on failure.  In the web server startup code, I use System.exit1 if the server cannot bind to ports.  However, this does not appear to register as a failure to the installer  the installation proceeds without invoking the failure strategy.p  pWhat is the proper approach for signaling failure to the Start a service action  Have other people taken an alternate approach to guaranteeing the installation uses available portsp

Negative 36606 pI have a solution with two projects.  The first is a basic class library project containing the definition of classes shared between several service endpoints DataContract.dll.  The second is a SQL CLR project that will use the classes defined in the shared assembly.  On my local machine I can register this assembly with local instance of SQL Server, add a reference to the assembly, and compile.  However, when I commit this code to our build machine the assembly is not registered on the server.  I could manually register the assembly on the build server, but this wont help new developers who join the project and have a broken build on their first checkout.  Also, our build server chooses a random name for the temporary directory it builds in, so the reference on the build servers database instance may be stale or missing.  Is there any way to reference the shared library project from my SQL CLR project such that the build server and new developers will always have a good buildp

Negative 36606 pHeres my scenariop  pIm using .NET 4.5 and creating a WCF Service that will expose sensitive data and will require a usernamepassword to access.

Negative 36606 pemUsing Offset or Indirect in Applies To does not seem to work. Is there any other way to stop conditional formatting from breaking after inserting rowsemp  pI have a conditional format for a range for e.g. O19O105. The condition is if cell value is  10, it is formatted with red color.p  pThe problem is  when I insert a row in excel, this formatting range splits and I get 2 formatting rules. For e.g. the 2 rules with range as O19,O21O105 amp O20 respectively, if I insert a new row at 20th row.p  pTypically for condition like the one above, it may not matter, if the rules are split into multiple ranges. But for conditions like highlight top 10, it causes undesired results.p  pI tried the following without much luckp  ol liTried using indirect  but excel seems to resolve the formula and saves the formatting rule and hence does not work with inserts as expectedli liTried using offset  here again excel resolves the range same as above.li ol  pAnyone knows how to write a conditional format that does not break with row insertsp  blockquote   p[EDIT] I realized that insert row is not causing the splitting of the conditional formatting rules. I also copy a row and paste in the inserted row which is doing this. If I opt for special paste and choose formulas only, its working fine.p blockquote

I need to deploy a wsdl to my tomcat7 server in eclipse.  I know it depends on the metro runtime, and I dont need to do anything fancy.  I just want to hit it with a browser and see some pretty XML.  Im fairly new to webservice development so I apologize if this question is sophomoric or has already been answered elsewhere but after trying every solution in my top 10 pages of google results and getting nowhere I think I may not even know enough about this topic to ask the right questions.  p

There will be at first just one list, and for now end with 64 lists.  p  pThe above example is for 3 lists, and in reality all the lists contain the same values zero to 255. I used the above examples just so you can see what the output should look like. p  pI figured there must be a better way to this, without having to build the nested for loops for each size of list of lists. p

Negative 36606 pI am currently in process of putting a process using a windows application in place where EFs POCO objects classes can be generated by pointing this app to the database tables.p  pI have seen T4 templates and the VS Addin which helps to achieve this in VS. However it requires T4 template file on the VS solution. We do not want to go through this route. What we want is to just copy the classes generated by this app to the solution so it can be used.p  pThe way T4 template works is that as soon as you make a change in the template it applies to the Class file. What I would like to do is to point the new App to the database and say tables A,B,C. The app will read the columns,types,relationships and create corresponding classes to a folder. Developer then Copy these classes and paste into VS solution. Longer terms plan then to extend this app to write repository classes.p  pI have rough idea but not a clear picture. Does anyone has any pointers about how about can I go to achieve this p  pThanksp  pEdit This is purely in mind using EF Code first.p

Negative 36606 pIm using pydev in eclipse.p  pI was hoping that pydev would first use the python classes I develop in my source dir. but since I also install the built egg into system dir, pydev also picks up the classes from system dir.p  pthe problem is that pydev uses system dir first in its python path. so after I installed a buggy version, and debug through pydev, and made the necessary changes in local sourcecode, it does not take effect, since the installed egg is not changed. or in the reverse case, as I was debugging, pydev takes me to the egg files, and I modify those egg files, so the real source code is not changed.p  pso How could I let pydev rearrange pythonpath order just like eclipse does for java build classpath p  pthanks yangp

Negative 36606 pPardon the question title hard to summarize this question.p  pOn Facebook, you codelikecode things. On Twitter, you codefollowcode people. On GitHub, you also codefollowcode people and codestarcode repos and gists.p  pAll of these cases are pretty similar those connections are lightweight, not really resources themselves. E.g. none of those three APIs expose public IDs for such connections.p  pThis raises the question strongwhats the best in terms of REST way to expose an API for creatingqueryingdeleting those connectionsstrongp  hr  pstrongFacebookstrong does [a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsreferenceapi relnofollow1a]p  ul lipcodeGET idlikescode to query an objects likes more precisely, the users that like that objectpli lipcodePOST idlikescode to like something on behalf of the authed user no req body neededpli lipcodeDELETE idlikescode to unlike something on behalf of the authed userpli ul  pThe querying and creating make sense, but the codeDELETEcode is a bit unRESTful, because youre not actually deleting the codeidlikescode resource an array of users that like that object.p  pThis discrepancy shows itself in another case [a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comblogpost540 relnofollow2a]p  ul licodeGET melikesidcode to query whether you like somethingli ul  pSo querying your connection is querying a totally different resource than creating or deleting it.p  hr  pstrongGitHubstrong leans to the codemelikesidcode style for following users and starring emreposem [a hrefhttpdeveloper.github.comv3activitystarring relnofollow3a]p  pNote that GitHubs codeusercode represents the authed user, like Facebooks codemecode.p  ul lipcodeGET userstarredownerrepocode for querying whether you have a repo starred returns 204 or 404, no body either waypli lipcodePUT userstarredownerrepocode for starring a repo no body needed in requestpli lipcodeDELETE userstarredownerrepocode for unstarring a repopli ul  pThis is much more consistent, but unfortunately this separates individual stars from the groupp  ul licodeGET reposownerrepostargazerscode to query the users whove starred a repoli ul  hr  pstrongGitHubstrong, interestingly, uses a different style for starring emgistsem [a hrefhttpdeveloper.github.comv3gists relnofollow4a]p  ul lipcodeGET gistsidstarcode for querying whether you have a gist starredpli lipcodePUT gistsidstarcode for starring a gistpli lipcodeDELETE gistsidstarcode for unstarring a gistpli ul  pThis keeps the starring action with the gist resource, like Facebook, rather than the user resource.p  pGitHub doesnt publicly expose emgistsem stargazers, but presumably itd be e.g.p  ul licodeGET gistsidstargazerscode to query the users whove starred a gistli ul  pWhile stargazers is indeed a different resourcename than star, the names are similar and clearly related, and theyre both on the same resource.p  pThe only downside I can think of to this is naming the resource.

Negative 36606 pIm using the jQuery plugin Quicksand to list some documents for my users to access, I have several hundred documents so I only show a few of them from the beginning. p  pThe list ul is built to show about 20 document titles at a time, and the rest is hidden. Like a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comsdauiikq5ht55yibDefaultList.png relnofollowthisa. At the bottom of the list you have a link to emShow moreem, and when you press it more titles are loaded. Instead of expanding the height of the list the parent div has the property codeoverflowcode with value codeautocode.p  pThe list is built by a javascript, it loads the documents from a MySQL database and hides all documents but a specified number. When you press Show more Visa fler in Swedish, as showed in the pictures it reloads the documents and excludes some additional documents form the hide function.p  pThe problem is this When I press emShow moreem it loads more titles but the list ignores codeoverflow autocode and the list expands over the entire page, like a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.coms1mylwxdihwgx05qListWhileLoading.png relnofollowthisa. After a second or so, when it has finished loading, the codeoverflowcodeproperty is applied and everything is as it should be, but it doesnt look very good when loading.p  pDo you have any ideas how to solve this Do you need to know anything elsep  pThanks in advancep
Negative 36606 pI want to implement the algorithm for a 2D water surface described a hrefhttpwww.gamedev.netpageresourcestechnicalgraphicsprogrammingandtheorythewatereffectexplainedr915 relnofollowherea and a hrefhttpfreespace.virgin.nethugo.eliasgraphicsxwater.htm relnofollowherea.p  pBut instead of using two int arrays and calculating on the CPU I would like to use SFMLs codesfRenderTexturecodes FBOs basically and a GLSL shader to run everything on the GPU. I want to use SFML, because its so simple and I have worked with it before, so I know my way around it a little.p  pIve made some good progress so far. I was able to set up 3 codesfRenderTexturescode and pingpong between them correctly because other than int array you cant read and write to the same codesfRenderTexturecode at the same time. I was also able to adapt the algorithm for the height field creation form being in the range 32.767 to 32.767 to the range 0 to 1 or to be more precise 0.5 to 0.5 for the calculation. Also adding new ripples works to some extend. So up to this point you can actually see a little of waves going on.p  pHere comes my problem now The waves disappear really, really fast and I dont even apply any damping yet. According to the algorithm the ripples are not stopping if there is no damping applied. Its even the other way around. If I apply amplification the waves look close to what you would expect them to look like but they still disappear without any damping applied to them. My first thought was that this is, because I use floats in range 0  1 instead of integers, but I only see this being a problem if multiplication is used, but I only use addition and subtraction. p  pHere is my SFML C code p  precodeinclude ltSFMLGraphics.hppgt include ltiostreamgt  int main      sfRenderWindow windowsfVideoMode1000, 1000, SFML works     window.setFramerateLimit12      sfRenderTexture buffers[3]     buffers[0].create500, 500     buffers[1].create500, 500     buffers[2].create500, 500     sfRenderTexture firstBuffer  buffers     sfRenderTexture secondBuffer  ampbuffers[1]     sfRenderTexture finalBuffer  ampbuffers[2]      firstBuffergtclearsfColor128, 128, 128     secondBuffergtclearsfColor128, 128, 128     finalBuffergtclearsfColor128, 128, 128      sfShader waterHeightmapShader     waterHeightmapShader.loadFromFilewaterHeightmapShader.glsl, sfShaderFragment      sfSprite spritefirst     spritefirst.setPosition0, 0     spritefirst.setTexturefirstBuffergtgetTexture      sfSprite spritesecond     spritesecond.setPosition500, 0     spritesecond.setTexturesecondBuffergtgetTexture      sfSprite spritefinal     spritefinal.setPosition0, 500     spritefinal.setTexturefinalBuffergtgetTexture      while window.isOpen              sfEvent event         while window.pollEventevent                      ifevent.type  sfEventClosed                 window.close              ifevent.type  sfEventKeyReleased ampamp event.key.code  sfKeyboardEscape                 window.close                    waterHeightmapShader.setParametermousePosition, sfVector2f1.f, 1.f          if mouse button is pressed add new ripples         ifsfMouseisButtonPressedsfMouseLeft                      sfVector2i mousePosition  sfMousegetPositionwindow             ifmousePosition.x lt 500 ampamp mousePosition.y lt 500                              sfVector2f mousemousePosition                  mouse.x  500.f                 mouse.y  500.f                  mouse.y  1  mouse.y                   stdcout ltlt mouse.x ltlt   ltlt mouse.y ltlt stdendl                  waterHeightmapShader.setParametermousePosition, mouse                                 waterHeightmapShader.setParametertextureTwoFramesAgo, firstBuffergtgetTexture         waterHeightmapShader.setParametertextureOneFrameAgo, secondBuffergtgetTexture           create the heightmap         secondBuffergtdisplay         finalBuffergtclearsfColor128, 128, 128         finalBuffergtdrawsfSpritesecondBuffergtgetTexture, ampwaterHeightmapShader         finalBuffergtdisplay           spritefirst.setTexturefirstBuffergtgetTexture         spritesecond.setTexturesecondBuffergtgetTexture         spritefinal.setTexturefinalBuffergtgetTexture          window.clear         window.drawspritefirst         window.drawspritesecond         window.drawspritefinal         window.display           swap the buffers around, first becomes second, second becomes third and third becomes first         sfRenderTexture swapper  firstBuffer         firstBuffer  secondBuffer         secondBuffer  finalBuffer         finalBuffer  swapper           return 0  codepre  pAnd here is my GLSL shader code p  precodeuniform sampler2D textureTwoFramesAgo uniform sampler2D textureOneFrameAgo uniform vec2 mousePosition  const float textureSize  500.0 const float pixelSize  1.0  textureSize  void main       pixels position     vec2 position  glTexCoord[0].st      vec4 finalColor  texture2DtextureOneFrameAgo, vec2position.x  pixelSize, position.y                          texture2DtextureOneFrameAgo, vec2position.x  pixelSize, position.y                          texture2DtextureOneFrameAgo, vec2position.x, position.y  pixelSize                          texture2DtextureOneFrameAgo, vec2position.x, position.y  pixelSize  2.0  2                         texture2DtextureTwoFramesAgo, position  0.5       damping     finalColor.rgb  1.9   lt uncomment this for the amplifiction ie. to see the waves better     finalColor.rgb  0.5       add new ripples     ifmousePosition.x gt 0.0              ifdistanceposition, mousePosition lt pixelSize  5                      finalColor  vec40.9, 0.9, 0.9, 1.0                    glFragColor  finalColor   codepre  pPlease remember that this is all just about the height field creation.

In the scenario of the asynchronous call, I need to know when the call is completed. Everything up to this point I understand how to do.p  pWhere I get into trouble is, the method that I am working on MUST be static.

Negative 36606 pIm currently doing some research in theoretical computer science, and one of the main tools Im using is prolog. Ive found it particularly handy for writing very quick tests to disprove conjectures.p  pHowever, Ive gotten to a point where the bruteforce search is getting too slow. While I could use a different language, the whole point of my using prolog is that its extremely fastsimple to write code to test a hypothesis.p  pIm wondering, is there an implementation of Prolog that allows for automatic paralellization It wouldnt have to be razor fast, but ideally Im looking for something that I could just drop my code into and get at least a small speedup.p  pI dont know if this is possible. Google search reveals lots of academic articles about automatic parallelism in Prolog, but I didnt come across any implementations. However, Im really only familiar with SWIprolog, so I could definitely use advice from someone familiar with many implementations.p  pMy code uses cuts, but I am fairly sure that I can eliminate them. As for IO, the only IO is printing to the console, which could probably be moved outside any parallel code.p

If that pixel matches the original pixel and matched pixel should be replace with red and yellow in java. p  pI searched a lot from javaforums and image processing websites. Still no perfect solution I got. p  pGive some pixel extractor and pixel matcher examples to proceed further. p

Negative 36606 pI am using JBoss AS 6.1 and the included version of CXF, which I believe is 2.3.1.p  pI have a web service with two operations  the first lets the client request some data.  It posts a message to a JMS queue and returns a ticket number.  A MDB picks up the message, processes the request, building an extract datbase table.p  pThe second operation lets a web client submit a ticket and, if the processing is done, returns the results.p  pNow, the issue is this  I would like for my MDB to build the results, then marshal them into XML using JAXB and store the XML in the database.  Therefore, when the second operation requests the data, I want to insert this XML from the database as the payload into the SOAP envelope.  FWIW I want to save the response already in the database in XML for two reasons  1, to facilitate saving this denormalized data instead of creating multiple extract tables, and 2 so that the response can go out as quickly as possible.p  pNow, I think I have to write a PhaseInterceptor to accomplish this, but if anyone can point me at an example that alters or writes out a SOAP payload, I would appreciate it.  Any JBossCXF specific examples would be great, but I think vanilla CXF examples will probably suffice.  Ive run across examples to modify headers.  I need something very basic and written for a small child. p  pThanks.p

Negative 36606 pIm doing interop with some native library, which has some nonnatural alignment feature which I want to simulate in .NET struct for the layout.

So the layout of MyStruct would bep  precode[oo] MyStruct.A 2 bytes data and 2 bytes padding [oooo oooo oooo] MyStruct.Xyz 3 int, no padding [oo] MyStruct.B 2 bytes data and 2 bytes padding codepre  pWhat I want to do is, I want to change the alignment of Int3 to 8 bytes, like somethingp  precode[StructLayoutAlignment  8] public struct Int3  ....  codepre  pThen the layout of MyStruct would becamep  precode[oo ] MyStruct.A 2 bytes for data, and 6 bytes padding, to align next Xyz to 8 [oooo oooo oooo ] MyStruct.Xyz 4 bytes padding for alignment of 8 [oo ] 6 bytes padding, because the largest alignment in this struct is 8 codepre  pSo, my question isp  p1 Is there such an attribute in .NET to control the nonnatural alignment like thisp  p2 If there is no such builtin attribute, I know there are other attributes such as StructLayout.Explict, OffsetAttribute, StructLayout.Size, StructLayout.Pack. With these attributes, I can simulate this layout manually, but it is not easy to use. So My second question would be, is there a way to hook into .NET struct layout creation which I can interfere the struct layout What I mean is, I can create a custom attribute to specify the alignment, and then I calculate the layout, but I dont know how to interfere the .NET to use that layout.p  pRegards, Xiang.p

Negative 36606 pI have a view which includes two subviews.  I had it working so that only one subview was shown at a time and each subview had a button and when the button was clicked the subview would flip over and the next subview would appear. The problem was that it appeared as though the entire view was flipping. After reading on this site about how to solve the problem I attempted to add the subviews to a container and flip that instead. However now, although my first subview is showing up when I press the button it no longer flip. It doesnt do anything. I put a log statement in the method which flips the subviews, as well as a breakpoint and as far as I can tell it no longer gets called. Im very new to xcode and objective c and delegates and I have no idea how to proceed. Any help would be appreciated.

In our application, we are expected to sync our local mysql database with a remote mysql database  running on a different host based on a trigger from the user interface. p  pUser trigger is in the form of a webpage and when the user clicks on a button, the php server script is fired which should perform this synchronization in the background.p  pWe planned to do it in a simple way by opening db connection with the remote and local db and inserting the rows, one row at a time. But the size of the remote DB table can be very high  as big as a few million entries and hence we need a more efficient solution.p  pCan someone help us with the sql query  php code which can do this db sync in an efficient manner without burdening the remote DB too much.p  pThanks in advancep  pShyam   p  pstrongUPDATEstrong The remote DB is not in my control so I cannot configure it as master or do any other settings on it. So that is one major limitation I have.  That is why I want to do it programatically using php. Another option I have is to read blocks of 1000 rows from remote DB and insert into the local DB. But I wanted to know if there is a better way  p

Negative 36606 pI have an activity with 4 fragments. On start theyre all hidden except for one which works perfectly fine.p  pThe problem however is that the first time Im doing .show on one of them the GUI stutters noticably. This only happens the first time it is shown, after that it runs superfast when interchanging between the fragments. p  pI suspect that the Listview is causing it but Im not sure why. Drawing an item takes 25 ms on average which should be smooth. Views are flat, i.e. no deep hierarchy, the viewholder pattern is used, and scrolling through the list is supersmooth.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 36606 pIve added zooming out to a highcharts application Im working on, but Ive noticed some really bad behavior when zooming back in.

The resulting zoom area is around 5, 600 to 10, 100... this is clearly not what the zoom request asked for.p  pIve tried hooking into the setExtremes event for the axis, and the bounds when this issue occurs are undefined. I cant figure out how to hijack the setExtremes request to fix the undefined value however. I also cannot recursively call setExtremes from within that event.p  pIs this intended behavior I can see why you would only want to zoom where data was  but Id really like the freedom to zoom to locations where there isnt data for the sake of perspective.p

Negative 36606 pFirstly, I apologize for being a complete n00b here. Assembly language is a whole different field for me, but Im keen to learn.p  pIm following along with a hrefhttpwww.cl.cam.ac.ukprojectsraspberrypitutorialsos relnofollowBaking Pia and just working through the first lesson. Im using a Mac Mountain Lion, but I do have Xcode installed, with the iOS SDK, since I use this for work. The iOS SDK already crosscompiles for ARM.p  pWhen I try to assemble the basic opening tutorial, I immediately get syntax errors, so obviously the assembler that ships with OS X, while it can assemble armv6, requires slightly different syntax. Can anyone point me to the right place to know what the differences arep  pThe issues Im running into right now are with this really basic code, which just turns on the LED on the Raspberry Pi.p  precode  Baking Pi tutorial from cam.ac.uk      This is just the code that is written during the    Baking Pi course from the University of Cambridge,    likely with some adjustments as Ive played around with    the code for exploratory purposes.     The addresses of the various hardware components are    only known from reading the manufacturers manuals.     Author       Chris Corbyn ltchrisw3style.co.ukgt    Architecture armv6    Hardware     Raspberry Pi Model B      the initial section appears first in the output    .section .init    declare a label for code placement    .globl start     begin main program instructions  start    load address of GPIO controller to register r0    ldr r0,0x20200000    Explanation The GPIO controller allocates 4 bytes for      each 10 pins. There are 54 pins,  6 x 4  24 bytes of      space. Each 4 btes is subdivided to 3 bits per pin.      Since we need the 16th pin, we want 3 x 6 bits within      the correct set of pins. Thats 6 x 3  18 bits, hence      the leftshift 18 bits. We then store the bit for the      address of the pin to the memory location of the GPIO      controller from r0, offset by 4 bytes, so that were      operating on the second set of 10 pins 1019.       This doesnt do anything yet were simply marking      the pin, before we send an instruction to a different      memory location to turn the pin off its backwards      thus turning the LED on.        put the number 1 to register r1    mov r1,1    leftshift the value in r1 by 18 bits    lsl r1,18    store value at r1 to mem r0, offset 4 bytes pin 16    str r1,[r0,4]     Explanation The instruction to turn off a GPIO pin      involves writing to the memory address 40 bytes into      the GPIO controller. We write the bit for the pin that      needs to be turned off. Conversely, offset 28 is used      to turn a pin on instead of off.       mov r1,1    leftshift to just the 16th bit, for the 16th pin    lsl r1,16    store value to r0, offset 40 bytes turn off    str r1,[r0,40]     declare a label for a loop which does nothing  loop    branch to loop label, thus loop forever    b loop    end of file   codepre  pAssembling the code with codeas arch armv6 sourcemain.scode showsp  blockquote   psourcemain.s17Expected comma after segmentnamep blockquote  pThat line isp  precode.section .init codepre  pI assume it wants a trailing comma, but changing it top  precode.section .init, codepre  pThen causes it to complainp  blockquote   psourcemain.s24unsupported relocation on symbol L0p      psourcemain.s24Undefined local symbol 0 0f or 0bp blockquote  pThat line isp  precodeldr r0,0x20200000 codepre  pIm lost before I even get started.

Negative 36606 pIm developing an extension in chrome and Im trying to perform an action each time a user searches in Google. Currently Im using a hrefhttpdeveloper.chrome.comextensionswebRequest.htmlchrome.webRequesta onBeforeRequest listener. It works perfectly most of the cases but some of the requests are done through the cache and doesnt perform any call. Ive found this in the API documentation about a hrefhttpdeveloper.chrome.comextensionswebRequest.htmlcachingcachingap  blockquote   pChrome employs two caches  an ondisk cache and a very fast inmemory cache. The lifetime of an inmemory cache is attached to the lifetime of a render process, which roughly corresponds to a tab. Requests that are answered from the inmemory cache are invisible to the web request API. If a request handler changes its behavior for example, the behavior according to which requests are blocked, a simple page refresh might not respect this changed behavior. To make sure the behavior change goes through, call stronghandlerBehaviorChangedstrong to flush the inmemory cache. But dont do it often flushing the cache is a very expensive operation. You dont need to call stronghandlerBehaviorChangedstrong after registering or unregistering an event listener.p blockquote  pIve tried using the handlerBehaviorChanged method to empty the inmemory cache, but there was no difference.

Negative 36606 pI am currently using the Excel C libraries Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel to read an excel spreadsheet into my C application. p  pI initially tried to read all the cells as their raw data, but found that Dateformatted cells were giving me a 5digit integer, and timeformatted cells were returning a decimal. So I then found out that you can use a dateconversion method built into Excels C library, like sop  precodeDateTime excelDate  DateTimeExcelCalcValue.ExcelDateToDateTimeworkbook, Double.Parsecell.Value.ToString output  excelDate.ToStringyyyyMMdd HHmm codepre  pThrough debugging my application with various test sheets, I have been able to record the various format strings that cells return when they are formatted in different ways.

Using the earlier code, I can detect a dateformatted cell and return the proper data in DateTime format. However, I cannot see an equivalent function for converting timeformatted cells.p  pI get a result of code0.58368055555555554code when I read a cell timeformatted as code[F400]hmmss AMPMcode.

I have three classes SceneStateManager controls only one Scene at a time  Scene  SceneLayer  GameObject  Component that make up the scene hierarchy which all are basically the same except for the name and some smaller, very specific features. Overriding methods will do it in this casep  pAll classes are initializable from the parent hierarchy level class type, and control a number of childs. As there is a lot of common functionality shared by the classes, I want to let them derive from a base class which groups the shared features to simplify the code.p  pThe super base class codeListJobltTgtcode is a class that controls the childs, and until now, all of the beforementioned types derive from it to simplify at least that part.

Negative 36606 pI am building a package in R with a very specific Simulated Annealing algorithm for my problem, and I have a doubt regarding C code and SEXP that I havent been able to solve. I am not an expert in R, I have been working with it for only 3 weeks... but I have to do this.p  pAs far as I know, the code.Callcode function in R passes the parameters as a SEXP structure to C by reference i.e. they are not duplicated.

I am asking because one of these parameters is quite big and uses a lot of space 107  1018 doubles, although I dont use them all in every iteration and I will call this function quite a lot of times, so if each time I call it this parameter gets duplicated I will run out of memory.p  pMWEp  pR callp  precodeMySimAn lt functiondefenergy, ipos, T0, Tfinal   ret lt .CallCMySimAn,defenergy, ipos, T0, Tfinal, seq0   ret  codepre  pC functionsp  precodedouble EnergySEXP defenergy, SEXP seq0, int i0   int i   double res0   fori0iltINTEGERGETDIMseq0[0]i     res  NUMERICdefenergy[i0INTEGERseq0[i]]      returnres   SEXP CmySimAnSEXP defenergy, SEXP ipos, SEXP T0, SEXP Tfinal, SEXP seq0   SEXP  Ene   PROTECTEne  NEWNUMERIC1   REALEne[0]  Energydefenergy, seq0, INTEGERipos   UNPROTECT1   return Ene  codepre  pWould something like this work the code in the function codeEnergycode is not checked so might be wrong Would I be creating a duplicate of defenergy each time I call it, whether in R or C Thank you very much for your help.p

But the way the question is worded, it implies there is a point where a binary tree actually does have the advantage over a Btree. So, emisem there a point when a binary tree is better more efficient than a BTree when they are stored on secondary storagep

Negative 36606 pIve created an Angular app that stores data in the browser session. The value of one of those keys happens to be an stringified keyvalue object. codekeykeyvalue, keyvalue, ...codep  pWhen I return the string from sessionStorage I parse it to recreate the object using codeJSON.parsecode or codeangular.fromJsoncode both have the same results and store it as a variable. I can codeconsole.logcode it at this point and clearly see the JSON object, in all its glory  exactly as I expect it. When I assign this object as an angular variable it assigns the object itself, not the keyvalues.p  precodevar myParsedObj  JSON.parsesessionStorage.getItemmyobjectstring   console.logmyParsedObj  returns Object keyvalue, keyvalue, ... scope.myParentObject.myObject  myParsedObj   console.logscope.myParentObject.myObject  returns [object Object] scope.myObject  myParsedObj   console.logscope.myObject  returns Object keyvalue, keyvalue, ... codepre  pCompounded on that is that when I set the scope to be myParsedObj it also inexplicably sets the sessionStorage item, which also becomes [object Object].p  pFurthermore, if myParentObject is removed and myObject is attached directly to the scope, it works fine and binds the data correctly. Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong Is there a workaround I can employ Ive tried using angular.forEach as well as angular.extend without any success.p

Negative 36606 pSo we have a SharePoint farm that is upon an AD forest, that forest is linked to other forests in a twoway trust.p  pThen, we have the people picker that is working quite fine and finding every user we try to find, regardless of what domain the user is on.p  pNow, I need to configure the people picker to find all users from current and future domains in the entirity of the relations BUT one of them. So, it must be a configuration where regardless of what domains, OUs, new or old 2way trusts are configured, the people picker will find users for all domains BUT one of them.p  pIve tried to search for an LDAP query thatd do the job to feed to codepeoplepickersearchadcustomfiltercode however could not find it or build it myself.

Negative 36606 pIve seen folks with similar questions, and theres a very good answer that has to do with building a control adapter. But my situation is a little differentp  pI have an ASPVB.NET 2010 site with about 2 dozen pages. Those pages contain up to 40 server controls each. There is a rolebased access requirement. So, TextBox1 might be visible to roles 1, 2, 4, 7, and invisible to the other roles.p  pThe brute force method would simply be, for each page, iterate through all the controls and explicitly decide whether to showhide them based on hardcoded rules, i.e.p  precode    Textbox1.visible  Sessionrole  1 Or Sessionrole  4 Or Sessionrole  7 codepre  pThis is certainly doable, but cumbersome to code and maintain. Does anyone have a neat shortcut they can think of I thought about using custom attributes in the html, but that was a nonstarter. The ControlAdapter method wont work.p  pSeems like this would be a somewhat common problem, so I hope someones come up with an elegant solution. Thanksp
Negative 36606 pOn gcc code4.7.3code, my codefegetroundcode function returns codeFETONEARESTcode.  According to the a hrefhttpwww.cplusplus.comreferencecfenvFETONEAREST relnofollowc referencea, this means rounding away from zero.  Essentially, it means saving the last bit that was shifted out when adjusting the precision of the mantissa after multiplication since it will be twice as long as it should be.  Afterwards, the saved bit is added to the final mantissa result.p  pFor example, floating point multiplication gives the following resultsp  precode0x38b7aad5  0x38b7aad5  0x3203c5af codepre  pThe mantissa after multiplication isp  precode  1011 0111 1010 1010 1101 0101 x 1011 0111 1010 1010 1101 0101  1[000 0011 1100 0101 1010 1110] [1]000 0101 1001 0101 0011 1001 codepre  pThe code[23b]code set holds the significant digits, whereas the code[1b]code set holds the last bit shifted out.  Note that the mantissa for the result isp  precode[000 0011 1100 0101 1010 1111] codepre  pThe last bit switched to code1code because the code[1b1]code set was added to the spliced mantissa the code[23b]code set due to the rounding mode.p  pHere is an example that is stumping me, because it looks to me like the hardware isnt rounding correctly.p  precode0x20922800  0x20922800  0x1a6e34c check this on your machine    1010 0110 1110 0011 0100 1101 x 1010 0110 1110 0011 0100 1101  01[01 0011 0111 0001 1010 0110 0][1]00 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  Final Mantissas        Their Result      01 0011 0111 0001 1010 0110 0 Correct Result 01 0011 0111 0001 1010 0110 1 codepre  pIve been crunching binary all day, so its possible Im missing something simple here.

Negative 36606 pI have an issue I cannot wrap my head around. Given the following bitmap image img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comza6mv.png althttpi57.photobucket.comalbumsg239broa29buttonszps1f99a501.pngp  pHow can I get a PNG of just the buttons without the background and with alpha transparent shadows around the edges so I can reuse that PNG over any type of background and not get any glitches I cant do it during generation as the buttons you see are HTMLCSS so all I can get is a bitmap of it.p  pAt first I only had the green background version and figured I would not be able to work with greens if I only did that so I redid the image so that I have R G and B backgrounds to compare with. I can thus easily identify which pixels should be left alone they are equal in all 3 sections, which need to be 100 transparent RGB value  background color and then Im left with the borders which have a mix of the color and background.p  pI graduated over 20 years ago so my math classes are really really far away, I dont have much experience toying with color mixing so Im a bit lost. I read a lot and tried to find algorithms for this and I cant find anything. I tried making one on my own and I got lots of close but no cigar attempts. Id really like to get a pixel perfect algo to do this if anyone has any ideas.p  pMy best shot involves comparing the R G and B values individually in all 3 images. What I found is that there is always 2 that are equal for each channel, so I use that one. The 3rd value which doesnt match I accumulate the 3 values, get the mean of them and use it as my alpha channel. The result isnt too bad, but its definitely not right. I tried using the inverted luminosity value as the alpha channel and that didnt work too well either.. Tried lots of other things which were even less conclusive.. If I dont touch the alpha channel, the resulting RGB color looks good, but its blended with black the more transparent the color should be, the blacker it gets.p  pA little hand on this one would be really appreciated Thanksp

Negative 36606 pI am trying to store dynamic properties about objects in SQL. As an example, lets say I have a table called codeobjscode that has two columns codeidcode, codenamecode. Now some users may want to store a property called codehocuscode while others may want to store a property called codepocuscode or even codebananacode. Anything really.p  pMy thought is to create two tables, codepropscode and codeobjpropscode. codepropscode would have two columns codeidcode and codepropnamecode, and codeobjpropscode would have codeobjidcode, codepropidcode, and codevaluecode.p  pMy only concern is this seems like a lot of overhead if there are millions of objects, each with 2030 properties.

Negative 36606 pI am quite new to Joomla, and recently built a template for it.  Everything has gone well in building the template, but I am now stuck with populating the content.  Id like to add blog functionality.  Here is the structure at the moment.p  pHome Page Category Blog for my blog articles.p  pIn index.php, there is a check for whether the user is on the home default page.  If they are, it adds a few different divs that give the home page a slightly different feel from the content portion of the website.  The homepage displays just fine, my problem occurs when I actually select the Read More of a blog article.  It seems to be staying on the default page and repopulating the Component with the content from the new article.  The result is that the single blog article looks like the home page.  p  pIf possible, I would very much like to avoid using the hidden menu solution to this which does solve the problem since I can assign modules to the menu item, and joomla no longer thinks it is on the default page.p  pI am looking for a solution which I can set up and then will not need to complete any intermediate steps in the future.  The ideal workflow is Create Blog Article  Assign to Blog Category  Home Page updates with new blog article  Single Article Page gets used to display the article NOT the Home Page.p  pI have so far been unable to come up with my own solution, or find another on the internet.  Help is greatly appreciated.p

The reason that I want to use tempfile is that my program gets raw html, parses it and stores it in a strongemfileemstrong. This file is overwritten every time a new input comes in, and would ideally be deleted when the program stops running. Also, the file doesnt have to exist when the program initializes so it seems logical from that view also.p

Negative 36606 pPattern to create private functions in Dojop  pThe Dojo documentation advocates the use of underscore to denote a function as private, but this is obviously just a convention and doesnt actually create a private function e.g.p  precodedefine[    dojobasedeclare ], function declare     return declarenull,          getPrivateData function              myPrivateFunction        ,         myPrivateFunction function              return Data from private function              codepre  pIve looked at the questions on SO about private variables in Dojo, but none of them reflect my requirement. However, one of the answers to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13248081dojosprivatevariablethis questiona includes a sample from the Dojo documentation showing how to create a private class. p  pMy question is, is there any reason why the same pattern should not be used to create a private function e.g.    p  precode define[ dojobasedeclare ], function declare       var myPrivateFunction  function          return Data from private function           return declarenull,           getPrivateData function               myPrivateFunction                 codepre

Negative 36606 pMy question is about if there is a way to know the coordinates of the corners of a gameobject.  What I have is three Vuforia AR targets and a gameobject, a cube in this case. p  pWhat I need to achieve, is so that when I move the targets around, the corners of the cube would follow the targets, eg. the cube would be as wide as the space between the targets.p  pRight now how it does it, is that it checks the distance between the targets and sets the scale of the cube according to it. This results in the cube being expanded always from its set position, which makes the positioning of the targets awkward in real life.p  pHeres a couple of pictures showing what it does now, taken during executionp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVZWvi.png altp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXEsbR.png altp  pHere is the code attached to the cubeobjectp  precodeusing UnityEngine using System.Collections  public class show  MonoBehaviour   float distancex float distancez   Use this for initialization void Start       renderer.enabled  false    Update is called once per frame void Update       if GameObject.Find target1.renderer.enabled ampamp GameObject.Find target2.renderer.enabled ampamp          GameObject.Find target3.renderer.enabled ampamp GameObject.Find target4.renderer.enabled               renderer.enabled  true            distancex  Vector3.Distance GameObject.Find target1.transform.position, GameObject.Find target2.transform.position     distancez  Vector3.Distance GameObject.Find target2.transform.position, GameObject.Find target3.transform.position       Debug.Log distancex     Debug.Log distancez      transform.localScale  new Vector3distancex, transform.localScale.y, transform.localScale.z     transform.localScale  new Vector3transform.localScale.x, transform.localScale.y, distancez      Debug.Log transform.localScale   codepre  pHow do I make the corners of the object follow the targets I need the width of the side to be the width of the distance between the targets, is there any way to achieve this without using the scalep

Negative 36606 pso I understand that for RSA encryption, you multiply two large primes to get a very large composite number, which is your public key. The two large primes are your private key, so you want to keep both of those primes secret, and you can do so because it is impossible for the computer to guess them, because you would have to increment your guess by 1 each time for a long time, because each prime number is so large.p  pHowever my question is why wont composite numbers work as well for this If one of the large primes in your private key was a large composite, wouldnt you still have to guess it by incrementing by 2,3,5,7,11, etc I know incrementing like this wouldnt take as long as incrementing by 1, but it would still take a long time because you dont know whether to increment by 2,3,5,7, etc. p  pAlthough if incrementing by 2 doesnt work, you can be sure private key lt publickey2, if incrementing by 3 doesnt work you can be sure that private key lt publickey3, and so on.p  pBut anyways, can someone tell me why composite numbers arent as good for encryption How would you guess a large compositep

Negative 36606 pThis is more of an academic question than one where Im really worried about the performance. Im just really curious is all. Ive also learned in my, admittedly limited, programming experience that the compiler is only smart about half the time.p  pI have a static class where a constant codeintcode is defined and I need to divide that constant by another integer. Now, I need a float value returned from that division, so I cant just leave them both as integers.p  precodeconst int CONSTANTINTEGER  69 int integer  0 float floatValue  0f  forinteger  0 integer lt CONSTANTINTEGER integer      float floatValue  integer  floatCONSTANTINTEGER     use floatValue for algorithm.....  codepre  pNow, my question Is the compiler smart enough to create a constant float in place of the codefloatCONSTANTINTEGERcode or does it cast the integer to a float every single loopp
Negative 36606 pI am on a Windows 8 machine. I use Git Bash when doing source control. I use Cygwin to ssh into my server.p  pI have a sensitive file private key in fact, which I want to have coderwxrwxcode permissions. p  pWhen running codels lcode from the Cygwin command line, the permissions for this particular file are coderwxrwxcode. This is exactly what I want, good.p  pHowever, when I run codels lcode from Git Bash, it says the permissions are coderwrrcode. This is not what I want. I even tried doing a codechmodcode from Git Bash on this file, and it didnt change anything.p  pI am assuming the permissions are just incorrect when viewing them from Git Bash. The file just doesnt have the permissions Git Bash thinks it has. However, I am worried that Git Bash could be correct. If this is the case, this is bad.p  pIs Git Bash just wrong Or what I am concerned because I dont want this file to be world readable.p  pIn the event that Git Bash is simply displaying the permissions wrong, why is that I know it isnt necessarily a big deal, but I am curious as to why it would distort this files permissions.p

Negative 36606 pI am using AFNetworking for downloading files having size between 1 to 4 gbs,.p  pCurrently while downloading such a huge files I pause the current download when app enters in background state and resume when it gets active.p  pBut what happens wrong in my case is that, first time while downloading when I minimize the app I pause it and when I again maximize app after 20 to 30 mins I resume it and download continues from where it was left paused last time.

Negative 36606 pI cant explain what I want to do in the correct terminology but Ill give an example.p  pA website has on most pages a quick contact form in a sidebar. Once the form is submitted on any given page that contains it, it fades and a confirmation message appears. How can I allow the website to identify that the form has already been submitted and then just display the confirmation message on all areas which would have contained it throughout the whole site. Ideally, this would only occur for a limited period of set time such as after 1 day or close of browser it resets and the form is present when that specific user access the website again.p  pHonestly, I have no idea where to even start with this, but an strongimportant thing to notestrong is that the form submission is just a dummy submission and is not actually sending any data to the server I know this is wrong but this task has the specific requirement of predominately client side access.p  pEdit A cookie was what I was after.p

Negative 36606 pFor the physics code I am working on we recently ran into a problem where when we increase our problem size so that some mpi messages are above 216 including the sizeof  those messages are received as just 0s. For messages prior to that size the communication happens correctly. p  pGoogleing the problem has led me to believe that the problem may be due to the eager limit see a hrefhttpblogs.cisco.comperformancewhatisanmpieagerlimit relnofollowthisa and a hrefhttpblogs.cisco.comperformanceeagerlimitspart2 relnofollowthisa. p  pOur current communication pattern is one where we post isends and then continue with our execution otherwise. On the receiving side we do iprobes after pieces of our execution finish, looping through all active iprobes and recv if the message exists. p  pMy attempts so far at reproducing this problem minimally havent worked yet p  precodeinclude ltboostmpienvironment.hppgt include ltboostmpicommunicator.hppgt include ltiostreamgt include ltvectorgt  int mainint argc, char argv[]     boostmpienvironment env     boostmpicommunicator world     int length  16384      stdvectorltdoublegt sendlength, 5.0     stdvectorltdoublegt noiselength, 10.0     stdvectorltdoublegt receivelength      stdcoutltltSent ltltstdendlltltstdendl     for stdvectorltdoublegtconstiterator i  send.begin i  send.end i         stdcoutltltiltlt      stdcoutltltstdendlltltstdendl     stdcoutltltsend.sizesizeofintltltstdendl     boostmpirequest req  world.isend0, 1, ampsend[0], send.size      boostoptionalltboostmpistatusgt msg  world.iprobe     whilemsg         msg  world.iprobe          boostmpirequest noisereq  world.isend0,1, ampnoise[0], noise.size     world.recv0, 1, ampreceive[0], length     stdcoutltltReceived ltltstdendlltltstdendl     for stdvectorltdoublegtconstiterator i  receive.begin i  receive.end i         stdcoutltltiltlt      stdcoutltltstdendl     req.wait      return 0  codepre  pWhich, unfortunately for me, compiles and runs without the in this case desired effect of just receiving 0s.

I will continue trying to edit the above code to try and observe the failure by bringing the code closer to what we are doing, but the basic idea is already as above. p  pWe think that changing the first iprobe to an irecv and then the loop to an test of the status object might help in solving the issue, but we do not understand what the issue is enough to be sure. p  pWhy does passing the eager limit cause us to receive 0s  Why doesnt it fail prior to that point  Why does it receive 0s as opposed to crashing if we are doing something wrong  How do we get our code workingp  pThe problem was first observed on Open MPI, it also occurs with MPICH and MVAPICH2.p  hr  pSince I cant answer this but I did discover the answerp  pThis exercise in bringing the above closer to what we are doing in the code was really useful and uncovered the error and why the eager limit mattered.

Negative 36606 pI was trying to reduce the time it takes for an ant build to complete. Most of the build time is taken by GWT compiler. p  pFollowing ant script is written on the lines of scripts found in official GWT examples. Notice how two GWT modules are being passed to the Complier. When you run this script, the GWT compiler compiles the two modules sequentially.p  precodelttarget namegwtc descriptionGWT compile to JavaScriptgt     ltjava failonerrortrue forktrue classnamecom.google.gwt.dev.Compilergt         ........         ........          ltarg valuecom.af.gwtmodules.dashboard.Dashboard gt         ltarg valuecom.af.gwtmodules.administration.Administration gt         ltarg line localWorkers 16 gt     ltjavagt lttargetgt codepre  pI changed the task to run 2 compile tasks in parallel and in each task I pass only one GWT module to the compiler. p  precodelttarget namegwtc descriptionGWT compile to JavaScriptgt ltparallel threadsperprocessor16gt     ltjava failonerrortrue forktrue classnamecom.google.gwt.dev.Compilergt         ........         ........          ltarg valuecom.af.gwtmodules.dashboard.Dashboard gt         ltarg line localWorkers 16 gt     ltjavagt      ltjava failonerrortrue forktrue classnamecom.google.gwt.dev.Compilergt         ........         ........          ltarg valuecom.af.gwtmodules.administration.Administration gt         ltarg line localWorkers 16 gt     ltjavagt  ltparallelgt lttargetgt codepre  pThis indeed runs faster as expected. However, I wonder whether the GWT compiler can do a better job at code optimization if it is given all modules at once instead of each module separately. For example, the two modules use a lot of common code. So if the compiler can see the entire code base at once, it can find more redundant code. In theory, it can create a single JS artefact for the common code and separate JS artifacts for code that is not common. This would have the effect of reducing download time for the user who accesses both modules as common JS artifact would be downloaded only once.p  pAs far as I understand GWT modules are independent and so there would be no cross module optimizations. But the fact that GWT compiler internally does not parallelize this makes me think that there could be some cross module optimizations or other ramifications because of which Google engineers decided against parallelizing it beyond a limit.p  pI would like to know if parallelizing compile the way I have done, has any effect on quality of generated code.p

Negative 36606 pA very simple math question. I am trying to implement a simple logic in one of my 2D flash football penalty shoot out games to check whether my player is on the right or left of a stable ball object. I would want to kick the ball only when the player is to the left of the ball and not on the right.p  pI am using ActionScript 3. I am trying to implement this logic in my main document class. I have two classes for the stable ball object and one for my player.p  precodeifmoveLeft ampamp moveRight ampamp canShootBall     for eachvar footyFootBall in footballArray         ifinstanceXena.hasCollidedfooty ampamp checkIfPlayerLeftfooty             traceCOLLISION WITH  footy.getId             instanceXena.playKickAnimation                 public function checkIfPlayerLeftfootyMovieClipBoolean       check if the player is on the left side of the ball object here   codepre  pSo I tried calculating difference in their x positions like instanceXena.x  footy.x but it would give the same positive number of course. If I can get a positive value for if the player is on the left and a negative value for if the player is to the right of the ball then it would solve my problem.p  pI remember using Vector3 dot product in 3D space to check if the player is in front or behind the enemy. But not sure if it applies here. How would I check itp

Negative 36606 pIdeally, a stringtodouble method would always yield the codedoublecode whose value was closest to the exact numerical value of the specified string for example, since 102030405060708072.99 is only 7.01 away from the next larger value, but 8.99 away from the next smaller value, it should round to the next higher value.  Neither codeConvert.ToDoublecode nor codeString.Parsecode seems to work that way, however both cause that value to be rounded down.p  pIt appears that the behavior is to ignore everything past the eighteenth digit, even if values beyond that cold affect how things are rounded.  Is there anything that emspecifiesem such behavior  Is there anything that specifies that every decimal representation of 18 digits or fewer will always be mapped to codedoublecode value which is no more than half an LSB away from the precise represented value, notwithstanding the fact that numbers of 18 digits or more may be mapped to a value which is nearly 916 of an LSB away from the indicated valuep  pBased upon a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24299692whyisaroundtripconversionviaastringnotsafeforadoubleWhy is a roundtrip conversion via a string not safe for a doublea it would appear that the behavior of conversion routines may vary between platforms.  To what extent is such behavior a deviation from spec, and to what extent does the spec leave such behaviors open  Is there anything in any specification which would indicate that adding a code0code to the end of the fractional part of a formatted codedoublecode will not affect the result of parsingp  pMy own expectation would be that floatingpoint methods should specify the degree of accuracy they promise.  In the absence of any specification to the contrary, I would expect floatingpoint methods to yield a result which would be within 12lsb of the arithmeticallyprecise result that would be yielded with some combination of numeric operands that were within 12lsb of the values passed, since that level of accuracy can often be achieved for about the same cost as anything sloppier, but accuracy beyond that is often much more expensive.  If a method is going to take extra time to achieve better accuracy, it should specify that to encourage code that needs to be fast, but doesnt need the full precision, to consider a faster n alternative.  Code should not require for correctness that a method it uses be more accurate than that unless the method promises better accuracy.p  pThe codeRcode formatting option for codedoublecode values in .NET is supposed to yield a value which, when parsed, will match the original operand, but does not specify what method of parsing should be used to achieve that result.  If one wants to convert floatingpoint values to strings in such a way as to guarantee systemindependent roundtripability, what must one do to ensure that any legitimate implementation of a parsing method will parse it the same wayp

Negative 36606 pI have a project that has a large number of files.  Between versions of our software, new files get added and some get removed.  Therefore, in automating our build process, I would like to have heat autogenerate a .wxs file lets call it files.wxs. p  pBut then there are certain handgenerated items, like the lt product  element with its associated version and lt environment  tags for environment variables that we need to set.  These never change except for the version number which increments.  Right now, I have put all of that in a file named  product.wxs. p  pHow can I best combine them into one .msi  Do I need to create a lt component  element inside the lt product  element for each of the fragments that were autogenerated in the files.wxs file  If so, that kind of defeats the purpose of autogenerating that file.  Im hoping there is another way. p  pHelp Thanks, in advance.p

I can get there code working just fine, but when I try to edit their html to look like the html beloe, it stops working. The css still applies as one would expect, and the div outside of the ngrepeat works fine. However, Im pretty sure that the .addEvent in the mootools javascript cant find the .item within the ngrepeat, so I am unable to grab any of the .items in ngrepeat.p  pAny ideasp  pUPDATE  OK, it appears that the problem involves the domready event in the javascript. The angularjs hasnt loaded when that fires. I tried the load event, but this also fires before angularjs loads. Any other ideas for events Im using mousedown right now, but this means you have to click on one of the images before you can start dragging them, which is not optimal. In addition, the mousedown event seems to cause strange duplicates to appear in the cart sometimes, so Ill need to find a better method.p  precodeltdiv iditemsgt     ltdiv classitemgt         ltpgttestltpgt     ltdivgt   ltdiv ngrepeatpost in postsgt      ltdiv classitemgt         ltimg classpicImage srcstaticimgspost.picture altSmiley face height128 width128gt         ltpgtShirt 1ltpgt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre

Negative 36606 pYears ago I wrote an application that used JAXB to generate Java bindings for an XML schema. The application code and the schema have been updated quite a lot over the years, but the JAXB jars remained the same since 2008, which was when I started using JAXB for this application. Ive been using Ant to build the application, including generating and compiling bindings, and everything worked fine on at least two XP Pro development machines. I made some changes to the schema and never had to think about JAXB.p  pRecently I tried to rebuild the application from scratch on a new laptop, and the build keeps failing. The new 64bit laptop is running windows 7 Pro, it had a newer JDK 1.7.045 and a new version of Ant 1.9.3. I was able to get around some weird problems by switching to a yet newer version of ant 1.9.4 and switching to latest JAXB jars. At this point, I dont even remember what those issues were but I can recreate them by reverting to older JAXB jars in SVN.p  pAfter upgrading JAXB, I ran into new problems. First of all, the xjc task in ant seems to be interpreting the codetargetcode attribute differently it threw some error and apparently the codedestdircode has the semantic meaning that codetargetcode used to have.p  pSecond, this task no longer generates the codeimplcode package with the implementation classes whose names were supposed to end with Type, so the rest of my code fails with a bunch of compilation problems.p  pIs there a way to make the new JAXB version backwardcompatible My other options are try updating the code to work with the new bindings, which seems like a lot of unnecessary work, or reverting to old JDK and Ant.p

Negative 36606 pI am working on a SpriteKit app with sprites bouncing around the screen iOS 8, iPad, landscape only, ObjectiveC. p  pAs a test case I have a sprite starting at the middle of the bottom of the screen then travelling up and to the right at 45 degrees. This works fine if I do not have a edge body around the screen, but behaves very strangely when I add the edge loop comment out the edge loop and it works again.p  precodeself.physicsBody [SKPhysicsBody bodyWithEdgeLoopFromRectself.frame]  codepre  pNOTE I have added an update at the end which explains the behaviour but not the cause.p  hr  pNSLog shows the edge loop being created with the expected frame 0, 0, 768, 1024, and the sprite being added with the correct position and velocity. p  pBy the time codedidSimulatePhysicscode is called the first time through the rendering loop, the sprites position has moved to a point a quarter of the way up the screen in landscape and the dx component of the velocity has become zero. The sprite then travels vertically, bouncing up and down over a distance of 512 points centered within the screen.p  pIn other words, the sprite seems to move up and down along a vertical line between 384, 384 and 384, 896, as though the edge loop is positioned at 384, 384, 0, 512 instead of 0, 0, 768, 1024.p  pIf I change the starting position of the sprite to be on this line, it starts at the correct position, but still loses its x velocity component and remains constrained to this line. If I start the sprite within the y range of this line but with an x coordinate off the line, it immediately moves to the nearest point on the line and the same behaviour continues.p  pAs suggested in other questions I have tried presenting the codeSKScenecode from the view controllers codeviewWillAppearcode and codeviewWillLayoutSubviewscode but the behaviour is the same.p  pI have tried hard coding the edge loop frame  no change.

Of course the only user that know the password is the admin not me, my client. If the password is right, server send an html page that allow to modify the content of the website.

In the clientside i simply do same post requests to the server, wich makes CRUD operations.p  pI need to make this system safe. Do i need https for autentication Do you think that a simple autentication password for admin would be enougth And what about the way i check if the passwords matches I was thinking to store the admin password in the database that have a password too but maybe is unuseful. i could simply compare two strings cause the password is only one, there are no other registered users different by admin.

Negative 36606 pIm trying to migrate our legacy build system to maven.  Ive successfully managed to get maven doing some tagging in CVS, by using the releaseprepare and releaseperform tasks.p  pIm new to maven, and my understanding of tags in CVS is a bit hazy, so please bear with me.p  pOur code consists of a series of modules, and each module is versioned in CVS using tags.p  pSo for example the module ERapitest has a version 0.18.0, 0.19.0, etc, each corresponding to tags in CVS eg ERapitest018.p  pNow I want to do some branching.  So I need to take an old version of the module, and branch it.  If I use version 0.8.0, then when I commit and promote create the CVS tag using our build system, that will give me 081.p  pNow when I check out the code for 080, the pom.xml has a version 0.8.0.  I believe that in order to branch this module, I will need to modify this to 0.8.1SNAPSHOT.  Indeed, when I make the modification manually, I can then use my maven releaseperform command to create 0.8.1.p  pId like to run a command which will make this modification of version automatically.  There is a maven command called releaseupdateversions which Im trying to use to do this, but it complains because my version is not a snapshotp  precode[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.pluginsmavenreleaseplugin2.3.2updateversions defaultcli on project ERapitest You dont have a SNAPSHOT project in the reactor projects list. codepre  pHow do I modify the version automatically  I would like to use a maven command if possible, as opposed to awk or sed, since the build system runs in java.p  pstrongEditstrong one option would be to try to use maven to do the branching.

Negative 36606 pHi Ive been searching through the web different ways to create a live chat with php, Ive read about long polling, ajax push Comet or what I think would be the best way to go using node.js. The thing is Im working on a 1 on 1 facebook style chat which I want to integrate in a script that I want to sell in a marketplace, so it is not for my own use, the problem here is that using node.js would make it more difficult for the customers to install the script so I am trying to find a different way to go that can give some good results without eating to many resources.p  pIve been thinking a lot about it and came up with an idea that may get criticised but I need to share it to then see different opinions and decide wether it may be a good way to go or not. The idea is the next  I would have all the chat messages saved in a mysql database, when a user opens a chat conversation he generates a json file that stores the last id of the last message posted, so then instead of checking in database for new messages you would be checking with ajax that json file to see if the id changed, if it changes you would then load the new messages from database. To make this work each time you post a message into that chat 1 on 1 conversation you are inserting it to database and also editing the json file with the new id.  I was also thinking about incrementing the time you check into the json file so that if for example a minute has passed and there hasnt been new messages instead of checking into that file every 3 secc the time would increment to 6 for example, and so on.p  pIt may be a bad idea, Im just sharing because I am really worried about making this chat work with the best possible performance and I dont really know which way to go, so I want to know if this is a good, bad or terrible idea, also if not good would appreciate any comment on which way to go. Thank you. p

Negative 36606 pI am developing an iPhone application and a Mac application that communicate with each other via Bluetooth LE. The iPhone is the central, and the Mac is the peripheral. I would like the iPhone application to be able to reconnect to the Mac application after a relaunch. Therefore, I save the UUID of the peripheral representing the  Mac in NSUserDefaults, and then when the iPhone app launches, I call code[CBCentralManager retrievePeripheralsWithIdentifiers]code, passing in the UUID.  Although this method returns the peripheral, when I call code[CBCentralManager connectPeripheraloptions]code, the iPhone never reconnects to the Mac. According to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma17576559643526thisa SO post, the problem is that the two devices need to be paired so that the UUID of the Mac is persistent. This brings me to my problem. I cannot for the life of me get the iPhone and the Mac to pair. According to a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationNetworkingInternetWebConceptualCoreBluetoothconceptsBestPracticesForSettingUpYourIOSDeviceAsAPeripheralBestPracticesForSettingUpYourIOSDeviceAsAPeripheral.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40013257CH5SW1 relnofollowthisa page of the Core Bluetooth Programming Guide, the way to require a paired connection is for the peripheral to set the characteristics properties and permissions to the appropriate values. I quote p  blockquote   pYou can ensure that only trusted devices have access to sensitive characteristic values by setting the appropriate characteristic properties and permissions. To continue the example above, to allow only trusted devices to retrieve a members email address, set the appropriate characteristics properties and permissions, like thisp blockquote  precodeemailCharacteristic  [[CBMutableCharacteristic alloc]     initWithTypeemailCharacteristicUUID     propertiesCBCharacteristicPropertyRead      CBCharacteristicPropertyNotifyEncryptionRequired     valuenil permissionsCBAttributePermissionsReadEncryptionRequired] codepre  pHowever, emthis does not work.em Even when I set the correct permissions and properties for the characteristic, the iPhone can still readwrite to it without a pairing dialog being displayed. Elsewhere I am told that the way to initiate pairing is for the peripheral to reject a readwrite request with an insufficient authentication error. According to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma16051170643526thisa post, p  blockquote   pTo pair, you need to respond to a write request with an insufficient authentication error. For example, for an iOS peripheral you would write something likep blockquote  precode voidperipheralManagerCBPeripheralManager peripheralManager didReceiveWriteRequestsNSArray requests    ...    [peripheralManager respondToRequestrequest withResultCBATTErrorInsufficientAuthentication]    ...  codepre  pBut this still doesnt work When the Mac rejects the write request with an insufficient authentication error, the iPhone receives a code[CBPeripheralDelegate peripheraldidWriteValueForCharacteristicerror]code callback with an error that says, Authentication is insufficient. No pairing dialog. I have no idea what to do and am considering dropping Core Bluetooth altogether if I cannot get this to work. If you have any idea how to get this to work, please let me know.p

Negative 36606 pThis is the situation Im inp  pI have a main table which has an codeidcode and several more columns.br Then there are 3 more tables that only contain an codeidcode JOINed to the codeidcode of the main table and a codetimestampcode.p  pThe ids on all tables are defined as unique so theres an implicit index by codeidcode which speeds up the JOIN. The problem is, if I retrieve the codetimestampcode after joining, it is not in the index so it forces Postgres into a bitmap index scan and a bitmap heap scan or a seq scan, depending on the  of rows, only for that value.p  pThe question is, should I replace the implicit index for one that contains both the id and timestamp That would be an index which has the same data as the table, sounds like a waste of space in that regard.p  pAlso, I think I have to keep the original index if I want the codeUNIQUEcode check to remain in place.p  pUPDATE Forgot to add, these tables have a very high constant write rate and sporadic reads, but reads access a lot of rows at once. That is why Id rather use all inserts instead of updates in place all in one table. The other thing is, rows from these tables might come at any order, I cannot ensure the main table row will be inserted before the small ones arrive.p

Negative 36606 pGreetings all very simple one. I have a drag and drop file uploader which likes to throw Drop event multiple times depending on how many times dragndrop window has been opened.

Negative 36606 pstrongResolved.strongp  pThe problem was that I was defining quartz jobs with identities that have a unique group id the scheduler id instead of a group id common to all hosts in the cluster. Since the scheduler id is unique to the host, each host in the cluster would look to see if that job already existed using the fully qualified job name groupId.jobName and surely it found it didnt, so it would create a new instance of Job1 and Job2 during startup. The quartz jobstriggers are never expired or cleared without an explicit request in Java or manual sql statement in Oracle. So over time the instances would build up, and instead of quartz running a single instance of Job1 and Job2, it would run all the instances of each job that had been created over time hence the multiple executions and multiple email alerts.p  pThe solution is that I replace schedulerId with a static string such as MyQuartzJobs when defining a jobs identity.p  pBasically, I changed the following line of Java codep  precodeJobDetail job   newJobJob1.class.withIdentityJOB1JOBNAME,  uniqueSchedulerId .withDescriptionJOB1DESC   created [  new Date  ] .storeDurablyfalse .requestRecoveryfalse .build codepre  pto something like the followingp  precodeJobDetail job   newJobJob1.class.withIdentityJOB1JOBNAME,  MyQuartzJobs .withDescriptionJOB1DESC   created [  new Date  ] .storeDurablyfalse .requestRecoveryfalse .build codepre  p Original Postp  pstrongGoalstrong         Have Job1 run once for a threenode cluster every 10 minutes, and Job2 run once for the same cluster every 5 minutes. Each job generates an email so at 1055am I should receive only one Job2 email from the cluster, and at 1100am I should receive one Job1 email and one Job2 email from the cluster, at 1105am I should receive only one Job2 email from the cluster, and so on...p  pstrongProblemstrong         Job1 is being run multiple times every 10 minutes on each node in the cluster, and the same for Job2 except every 5 minutes. This leads to many, many more than one or two emails.p  pstrongConfigurationstrong      Threenode linux cluster      Each machine NTP configured and timesyncd      Oracle DB      Quartz v2.2.0 cluster mode          Jobs configured via CronTrigger      Each node has an instance of the same standalone Java application running on it, and the Java application instantiates an instance of the quartz scheduler in clustermode.      quartz.properties files are identical on each machine. p  pI have investigated all the obvious potential causes, but nothing explains it or presents a fix. I have even tried inserting an artificial 10second sleep instruction in the job, to ensure that it doesnt finish in under a second.

Negative 36606 pWhat Im trying to dop  pAn Entity is a blank object containing an ArrayList of components and little else. The Entity class implements Cloneable.p  pComponents are all classes that are subclassed off an abstract Component class. Some of these are rather complex and implement a number of interfaces.Yes its not a true ECS, Ive got methods in therep  pIm using text files to define the name to be given to an Entity and the components it will contain. One of each type is built via strings parsed from the text file and added to an ArrayList well call the EntityCache.p  pI would like to be able to clone these cached objects as required but it seems that each Entity of a given type shares the same Components which is obviously undesirable. Is there a way to get them to not do thisp  pId rather not use the EntityBuilder each time as its building them via strings which I understand can be rather slow lots of casts, etc.p

Negative 36606 pIm new to PDFLib and im trying to get something workp  pI got the following situationp  pThere is a quite clean pdf with two textlines. After these two textlines i want to place a paragraph of text. The thing is, the length of these text is dynamic because it is user input. It could even be more then 1 page of text, all in one paragraph. After this paragraph i want to continue adding textlines like i did before the paragraph. This works for me when the text in the paragraph fits on the first page. If it doesnt, text will flow over and i am not able to add more pages. So my question in this case is How to create code that will dynamically add more pages if needed I assume that the rest of my code is working and the next textline containing TEST is actually placed after the paragraph, but the probleem is that this isnt visible because the text flows of the page...p  pHere is my code a small partp  precodeLipageWidth   595               LipageHeight  842

Negative 36606 pI installed the MetroFramework in VB 2013 via NuGet and I have it working partially.

Then that control I attempted to put on the Form appears in the gray box with a small icon and its name by it. If you double click on the control in the gray box, it will open the Form.vb eventsobjects, but it will not initialize an event for that control.p  pThere is not a lot of info on the net for the MetroFramework, and nothing in relation to my problem.p  pHow do I make those controls appear on the formp  pAnd, what exactly is that gray box on the bottom with the nonviewable controls I have never seen it before.p
Negative 36606 pIve been working really hard trying to find a solution to this for the past few weeks. I have committed to a direction now, but I am still not entirely satisfied with what I have come up with. Asking this now purely out of curiosity and for hope of a more proper solution for next time.p  pHow on earth do I keep multiple QAbstractItemModel classes in sync that are referring to the same source data but displaying in different ways in the tree viewp  pOne of the main reasons for using modelview is to keep multiple views in sync with one another. However, if each of my views requires different data being displayed at the same column, as far as I can tell I need to then subclass my model to two different models with different implementations that will then cater to each of those unique view displays of the same items.p  pUnderlying source items are the same, but data displayed is different. Maybe the flags are different as well, so that the user can only select top level items in one view and then can only select child items in the other view.p  pIll try to give an examplep  pLets say my TreeItem has three properties a, b, c.p  pI have two tree views TreeView1, TreeView2. Each has two columns.p  pTreeView1 displays data as follows column1  a, column2  bp  pTreeView2 displays data as follows column1  a, column2  cp  pI then need to create two different models, one for TreeView1 and one for TreeView2, and override the data and flags methods appropriately for each.p  pSince they are now different models, even though they are both referring to the same TreeItem in the background, they are no longer staying in sync. I have to manually call the refresh on TreeView2 whenever I change data on TreeView1, and vice versa.p  pConsider that column1, or property a, is editable and allows the user to set the name of the TreeItem. Desired behaviour would be for the edit that is done in TreeView1 to instantly be reflected in TreeView2.p  pI feel like I am missing some important design pattern or something when approaching this. Can anyone out there see where I am going wrong and correct me Or is this a correct interpretationp  pThanksp

Negative 36606 pOkay so my question is pretty specific and I apologize in advance. Im a new programmer and tried developing on my own from scratch. It was relatively successful only I have one last problem, that I can see. You can view my code here in its entirety.p  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comMarioRizoProjectsblobmasterAlcoholClass.py relnofollowProjectap  pSo the problem Im having is related to the way I save the file. I first tried to pickle it since its a dictionary but I kept getting an error because my dictionary isbr name, class pairs.p  pI searched around on here and saw I could try JSON to do the same. Ended up with the same kind of errors. Eventually I found the klepto module which worked. I saved my dictionary successfully and loaded it successfully. It wasnt until later I found that I can add new items to the file but whenever I remove something from my dict and save. The next time I load it. The key I removed is still there.p  pTLDR Can add things just fine to my dict and save to  txt file but when I remove from the dict and save it wont save the removed key.p  pAnyway Im stumped on where my problem lies in the way Im saving the file or the way Im loading it or both Any help would be very appreciated.p  pEdit Ok Im assuming its the way I have it currently set to save and load.p  precodetry     alcohols  filearchiveAlcohols.txt     alcohols.load except IOError     alcohols       printalcohols doesnt exist. codepre  pandp  precodeprintExiting and saving the data.         alcohols.dumpAlcohols.txt saves the dictionary data as is codepre  pIt saves the dictionary fine while adding new items but say I have to make an edit and remove something then save and exit. Next time loaded up it would have the old items as well as any new ones. Oddly enough I seem to have broken something in all my editing. Doesnt save new entries.p  pEdit2p  precode                del alcohols[name] deletes the key out of the dict codepre  pThis is how I remove the keys. Originally I was using the pop method but when it wouldnt save the changes I tried this. As a note it DID remove they key, value from the dictionary but saving and reloading wouldnt reflect that change.p  precode                alcohols[name]  Alcohol instantiates the new class codepre  pThs is how I am creating new key, value pairs. p  pSOLVED editp  pMy problem was with the way I deleted them from the dictionary. In case anyone stumbles into here later. Look at Mike Mckerns answer. Had to remove from the archived dictionary.p

Negative 36606 pI have implemented several functions to convert sRGB to the a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiLabcolorspaceCIELABCIELaba color space.p  pNow, Id like to use that for dithering, but Im unsure how to exactly discern which color is the lower color, and which one is the higher color.p  pWhen dithering in a onedimensional color space gray scale things are easy. When using error diffusion dithering, I calculate the nearest gray scale value from my palette, and add the error to the surrounding pixels, depending on what kind of dithering matrix I use for instance FloydSteinberg. Since this is onedimensional, its pretty easy, there is just this one value. But now I have this three dimensional color space, should I just add the error to each coordinate individuallybr emThis is the only way it makes sense to me, at this point.emp  pWhen dithering with an a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiLabcolorspaceCIELABordered dithera matrix, things get even emmoreem complicated. Ordered dither matrices define a threshold value. For this, I need to know the lower pixel value, and the higher pixel value of my pallet, in regards to my current pixel that Im about to dither. Now, I calculate the distance to both pixels, the threshold value from the dither matrix decides after which value between those to neighboring pixels, the pixel is either dithered to the lower, or to the higher pixel.br emThe actual implementation would of course be more optimal than calculating that, by using a matrix that is sensibly chosen for the amount gray scale color values in my pallet. Also, things like choosing the pallet with evenly spaced color values, etc.embr This is  again  pretty easy in a onedimensional color space. but in CIELab, there is no higher or lower value as such.p  pUsing just the luminance to apply the threshold matrix to, seems pretty incorrect, I might have two colors with the same luminance in my pallet, then whatp

Negative 36606 pI am looking for the most effective way to unit test a class that uses codeNSURLSessioncode to retrieve data from a URL. I have seen older examples of classes that implement the codeNSURLConnectionDelegatecode protocol. From reading the codeNSURLSessioncode class reference documentation, to use the same approach my class would have to implement the codeNSURLSessionDataDelegatecode protocol. This I believe will also require implementing the codeNSURLSessionTaskDelegatecode and codeNSURLSessionDelegatecode protocols, which together contain a number of methods that I dont need. p  pIs there a simpler way to accomplish the same objective p  pThanks. p
Negative 36606 pIve created an app that uses sqlite databases to save users entries name and phone number.

Negative 36606 pok, so i have been going around in circles for the past couple of days on this problem, unable to find a working solution, perhaps i dont know how to phrase the question right. But here goes. p  pi am working on a project that is using a RecyclerView adapter, to load and display simple elements from my sqlite database, containing a String quote and a string reference to an image ressource. This part works just fine, but i cant seem to be able to delete any items.p  pi have gone through the code making sure that the connection to my database is only opened when needed and closed afterwards, and there should be no open issues here. p  pi can actually delete item from inside the Recyclerview adapter when clicking on a element, but if i exit and enter again, the deleted items have been loaded again. This places my problem with the database i would think, or perhaps some sort of dueling banjos like problems where a functions recreates a deleted item. But i have followed the code numerous times now, and for the life in me, i cant seem to solve the issue. p  pAt the moment in my delete click event i am running a delete call to my database and my recyclerview adapter, but the problem persists.p  pi was hoping for any input that could help my pinpoint the issue. I am not sure what code to include in this question, i have included my RecyclerView adapter and database adapter. And i know how close to impossible it is to answer these sort of questions without being able to see the code, but still. p  pplease excuse the mess. i have been trying out a lot of things.p  p

Negative 36606 pI have a long, paged table with one check box on every row. The rows are being constantly updated with new objects from the server, so I think its easier to save the ids of the checked ones into a ES6 codeSetcode or an object hash.p  pI also need to enabledisable some buttons based on the number of selections, so a live count of selected entries is needed.p  pIf I use object hash, which codengmodelcode supports, a loop is needed to count the number of codetruecode entries, which is costly as the loop will be called again and again by codewatchcode.p  pcodeSetcode natively provide a codesizecode property and can natively handle codenumbercodes.

Negative 36606 pIm using Hibernate 4.3.10.Final with SpringData JPA running on a Postgres 4 database and have run into a very strange bug.

The project already uses Velocity JS for other stuff so it doesnt make sense to include a different library just because that is what Edge uses for one animation.p  pThe animation is a beaker that fades in and then two bubbles use custom easing to bubble out of the top of the beaker.p  pThe SVG for the beaker is on a fiddle and the code GSAP produced is below  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netdarkerheroe9zjrq0zq relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netdarkerheroe9zjrq0zqap  precodeltpregt      Bubbles          version 6.0.0,         minimumCompatibleVersion 5.0.0,         build 6.0.0.400,         scaleToFit none,         centerStage none,         resizeInstances false,         content              dom [                                      transform [[], [], [], [0.5, 0.5]],                     borderRadius [50, 50, 50, 50],                     id Bubble01,                     opacity 0,                     rect [3px, 2px, 36px, 36px, auto, auto],                     stroke [2, rgba234, 239, 240, 0, solid],                     type ellipse,                     autoOrient true,                     fill [rgba255,255,255,1.00]                 ,                                      transform [[], [], [], [0.75, 0.75]],                     borderRadius [50, 50, 50, 50],                     id Bubble02,                     opacity 0,                     rect [3px, 2px, 29px, 29px, auto, auto],                     stroke [2, rgba234, 239, 240, 0, solid],                     type ellipse,                     autoOrient true,                     fill [rgba255,255,255,1]                              ],             style                  symbolSelector                      rect [null, null, 40px, 40px]                                       ,         timeline              duration 4000,             autoPlay true,             data [                 [                     eid2211,                     opacity,                     581,                     919,                     easeOutQuad,                     Bubble02,                     0,                     0.5                 ],                 [                     eid2210,                     opacity,                     1500,                     1000,                     easeOutQuad,                     Bubble02,                     0.5,                     0                 ],                 [                     eid2230,                     opacity,                     90,                     160,                     easeOutQuad,                     Bubble01,                     0,                     0.49659030720339                 ],                 [                     eid2231,                     opacity,                     250,                     750,                     easeOutQuad,                     Bubble01,                     0.4965899884700775,                     0.5                 ],                 [                     eid2232,                     opacity,                     1000,                     1000,                     easeOutQuad,                     Bubble01,                     0.5,                     0                 ],                 [                     eid2201,                     location,                     0,                     2000,                     easeOutQuad,                     Bubble01,                     [[22.23, 22.57, 0, 0, 0, 0,0],[37.23, 71.23, 75.36, 182.55, 64.78, 156.91,99.63],[39.24, 257.75, 17.9, 162.49, 20.57, 186.71,288.05],[15.3, 365.28, 0, 0, 0, 0,410.23]]                 ],                 [                     eid2203,                     location,                     500,                     2000,                     easeOutQuad,                     Bubble02,                     [[23.29, 18.78, 0, 0, 0, 0,0],[58.43, 65.15, 99.73, 231.78, 45.91, 106.69,95.65],[57.39, 269.81, 85.4, 51.39, 102.76, 61.84,310.38],[66.53, 365.66, 0, 0, 0, 0,411.13]]                 ]             ]              ,  ltpregt codepre  pMy question is this Is a conversion even possible between the two libraries Ive already spent a day on this and dont fancy wasting any more time trying to do something that isnt going to work.p  pIm not looking for a tool to handle this conversion as this is a learning exercise one where I think ive bitten more than I can chew, but more of an example or an explanation about how I would go about converting the GSAP timeline or even just the custom easing part to Velocity JS code.p  pReally appreciate any input on this.p  pMany thanksp

For instance, 1025 would be 10.25. Several languages also have builtin types to deal with money. strongSolution 2strong Among others, Java has the BigDecimal class, and C has the decimal type.p blockquote  psubemEmphasis added to highlight the two suggested solutionsemsubp  pThe first solution is essentially a variant of the fixed point approach.  There is a problem with this solution in that the suggested range tracking cents is insufficient for mill based calculations and significant information will be lost on rounding.  p  pThe other solution is to use a native codedecimalcode class which is not available within C.p  pLikewise, the answer doesnt consider other options such as creating a struct for handling these calculations or using an arbitrary precision library.  Those are understandable differences as Java doesnt have structs and why consider a 3rd party library when there is native support within the language.p  pThis question is different from that question and other related questions because C doesnt have the same level of native type support and has language features that the other languages dont.  And I havent seen any of the other questions address the multiple ways that this could be approached in C.p  hr  pstrongemThe Questionemstrongbr From my research, it seems that codefloatcode is not an appropriate data type to use to represent currency within a C program due to floating point error.  p  pWhat should I use to represent money in C, and why is that approach better than other approachesp  psup1sup subemThis question started in a shorter form, but feedback received indicated the need to clarify the question.emsubp

Negative 36606 pI am searching for hours and hours on this problem and tried everything possible but I cant get it cracked, I am quiet a dictionary noob.p  pI work with maya and got clashing names of lights, this happens when you duplicate a group all children are named the same as before, so having a ALLKEY in one group results in a clashing name with a keychar in another group.p  pI need to identify a clashing name of the short name and return the long name so I can do a print long name is double or even a cmds.select. Unfortunately everything I find on this matter in the internet is about returning if a list contains double values or not and only returns True or False, which is useless for me, so I tried list cleaning and list comparison, but I get stuck with a dictionary to maintain long and short names at the same time. I managed to fetch short names if they are duplicates and return them, but on the way the long name got lost, so of course I cant identify it clearly anymore.p  precodegtimport itertools  gtimport fnmatch  gtimport maya.cmds as mc  gtLIGHTTYPES  [spotLight, areaLight, directionalLight, pointLight, aiAreaLight, aiPhotometricLight, aiSkyDomeLight]   create dict dblList  long  short for x in mc.ls typeLIGHTTYPES, transformsTrue     y  x.split[1][0]     dblList[long,short]  dblList.setdefaultx, y    reverse values with keys for easier detection revmultidict   for key, value in dblList.items     revmultidict.setdefaultvalue, set.addkey  detect the doubles in the dict print [values for key, values in revmultidict.items if lenvalues gt 1] flattenList  setitertools.chain.fromiterablevalues for key, values in revmultidict.items if lenvalues gt 1  so by now I got all the long names which clash in the scene already means now I just need to make a for loop strip away the pipes and ask if the object is already in the list, then return the path with the pipe, and ask if the object is in lightlist and return the longname if so. but after many many hours I cant get this part working. as example until now print flattenList returns gtset[uALLblockersALLKEY, uTSLB0140scSet, uJUNETOPShape, uTSLB0140scChars, uALLALLKEY, uscChars, uscSet, uscFX, long, short, uTSLB0140scFX]  we see ALLKEY is double and thats exactly what I need returned as long name  THIS IS THE PART THAT I CANT GET WORKING, CHECK IN THE LIST WHICH VALUES ARE DOUBLE IN THE LONGNAME AND RETURN THE SHORTNAME LIST. THE WHOLE DICTIONARY IS STILL COMPLETE AS  seen  set uniq  [] for x in dblList2     if x[0].split[1][0] not in seen         uniq.appendx.split[1][0]         seen.addx.split[1][0] codepre  pthanks for your help.p
