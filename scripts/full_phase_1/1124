Positive 1124 pIn an app, Im building a component relies on a user being able to send an image along with some parameters to a server built using Flaskpython. Im firing an HTTP POST as a multipartformdatap  pFirst time doing this, so I googled for some samples and saw that most people use a bufferedprintwriter to write the message as they build it to the output stream. I decided to first compose the entire message in the form of a String and then write it as bytes to the server. i.e write the whole thing as a string including the image bytes then convert to byte[] and write to the server stream.p  pThis method worked perfectly for just parameters, but when an image is involved the resultant file on the server is unreadable. I understood early on that converting the images bytes to a string was the culprit so what I did was change my code to first compose the preimagebyte multipart message as string, convert to bytes, write to the server and finally write just the raw image bytes to the server. p  pThis fixed the problem, and the server is now decoding the image correctly. However I am still wondering is there some way I can transfer the pictures raw bytes as a string for it to be decoded correctly reminder server is in Flask and if not then please explain to me why notp  pI apologize if this is a very dumb question but would certainly like getting my head around this whole thing.p  pEDIT converting String to bytes using String.getBytes.p

Positive 1124 pI have been searching, testing, and coming up with nothing for over a week.  I want to use FFMPEG to convert mp4s and mkvs to AVI files that will play on my DLink DSM520.

Is FFMPEG incapable of generating a file that the DSM520 can play The reason I want to use FFMPEG over Mencoder is that its much faster.

The DSM520 is hooked up to a bedroom tv that isnt a smart tv.p

Negative 1124 pIm developing a C application on Windows Mobile, and like most of my WM applications, I always get bogged down whenever Im deciding on a serialization strategy.   In the desktop world, Im not too worried about it because ive already developed a pretty robust custom xml serializer  however, in the WM world, I dont want to use it because of the reflection performance penalties.p  pSo I develop everything against Data Access Objects DAO interfaces, so I can easily swap out different implementations for serializing to xml, registry, sqlce, etc.    While developing in the beginning, I usually implement a nonpersistent inmemory DAO using Dictionarylt, followed by a XmlSerializer DAO when I want to persist data, and then when everythings completed, move to a fullblown sqlce DAO.p  pHowever, in my latest app, I cant use an XmlSerializer DAO because of how badly it doesnt handle properties that are interfaces.   IE, I have a Foo object which contains a Listlt IBar  Bars property, XmlSerializer cant serialize it although I was easily able to develop my own custom xml serializer which could  go figure.p  pAll that to ask this question   What DAO strategies have you found to help you develop applications for WM   Do you plan ahead for several different DAOs at different app maturity levels   Do you start at the fullblown sqlce DAO   What would you recommend for a quickandeasy persistent serialization DAO when XmlSerializer cant be usedp

Negative 1124 pIve got a few layered windows in my app that use a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms63355628VS.8529.aspx relnofollowcodeUpdateLayeredWindowcodea to handle their visual representation.  According to the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms997507.aspx relnofollowMSDN article on layered windowsa, when using codeUpdateLayeredWindowcode the application doesnt need to respond to codeWMPAINTcode or other painting messages.  They shared some of the same message handlers as nonlayered windows, so I figured I would just return early from codeWMPAINTcode handling if the target is a layered window.p  pOf course, this caused one major issue if one of the layered windows emdidem get a codeWMPAINTcode message, the input queue would end up flooded with an unending stream of codeWMPAINTcode messages.  This endresult makes sense, since the window would never be validated and so it will keep thinking it needs to paint I shouldnt be returning from the handler without validating or codeBeginPaintcodeing, etc., but what emdoesntem make sense is why it received the message in the first place, since it has no effect on a window that was using codeUpdateLayeredWindowcode.p  pIt wouldnt even happen reliably  just every now and then, and not every time the windows pixels needed redrawing.  Sanity was restored by falling back to codeDefWindowProccode when a layered window got a codeWMPAINTcode message, but I feel like something is going on that I dont understand.  And considering how seldom this problem manifested itself, Im worried this might just be hiding an even subtler problem.  Is it expected behavior for a window using codeUpdateLayeredWindowcode to still get the occasional codeWMPAINTcode message  Does it matter, as long as I handle it correctlyp  pAdditional info, if needed the window is calling codeUpdateLayeredWindowcode immediately after being created, and then its left on its own it doesnt call it again, since it doesnt change.  Using C and win32 API, no MFC.p

Negative 1124 pMy project has been using a base page to hold common page functionality.  Its worked until the base page grew to be huge, so I tried to factor the base page into several classes.

Negative 1124 pI have a site that has worked fine for a while.  Recently, any form passed as a querystring GET that has the words SELECT, FROM, and WHERE in it causes the page to hang and, eventually, give a Page not found... error.  It looks like this only happens with IE, not Firefox, but has been confirmed using several clients.  Also, it only happens on one server...if I copy the same test script to another server, no problem.  The words do not have to be passed from a form, they can also just be appened as a querystring.p  pSo, for example, p  pa hrefhttpwww.problemserver.comqsfails.aspqselectfromwhere relnofollowhttpwww.problemserver.comqsfails.aspqselectfromwhereap  pfails on the server that exhibits the problem.  In fact, if I replace qsfails.asp with a page name that does not exist, the page loading still hangs and waits until it times out, whereas trying to load a page that does not exist but without the querystring gets an immediate Page not found... error.p  pIs the server compromised  The hosting company claims it is not.  Has anyone ever encountered this  Thoughts or suggestionsp  pThanksp

Im working on a shipment piece to provide information such as ratesdelivery times to my users. To centralize the actual services, I have a WCF web service which persists any domain entities.p  pTo simplify the domain model I basically have 2 classesp  precodepublic class Shipment   public IListltItemgt Itemsgetset   public class Item   some primitive properties  codepre  pI also have a corresponding set of DTOs that were created to lighten the load across the wire. The presentation pieceor pieces, whatever touches the web service, use the DTOs with no knowledge of the domain model.p  pMy question comes here. To create a shipment, the service accepts a list of items. There is logic to creating shipments, which is all hidden behind the web service. In essence, this means that ItemDTO is passed across the wireclient  server, shipments are created, then ShipmentDTO is passed backserver  client. Now, ShipmentDTO has a child list of ItemDTO as well, which creates the 2way mapping scenario.p  pThis is more than a simple CRUD operation and Im farely new to the Command Message pattern, so Im curious how the community would solve this issue.p  pDo you pass a DTO both ways with 2way mappingp  pSample usagepresentation layerp  precodeListltItemDTOgt list  new ListltItemDTOgt add items to list   ShipmentServiceClient client  new ShipmentServiceClient ListltShipmentDTOgt shipments  client.GetShipmentslist  shipments are now displayed to the user with respective costs and other useful data codepre

Unfortunately, I have to use TFS and Visual Studio  no switching to Subversion or Git.p  pI am in the process of writing an MSBuild script to, whenever files are checked into a certain directory in the tree, get the latest version of the modules, put them in a ZIP archive, and then FTP the ZIP archive to a testing server, where theyre then unzipped and processed.p  pIf I configure a build with TFS and use its default build methods, nothing really works as my .sln file doesnt contain any of the things MSBuild expects  after all, theres nothing to compile.

If I go for a standard approach, the code would be littered with ifelse statements. However, if I go with a large framework  I feel it is overkill for what is basically a database access layer  especially given the high upfront learning curve. Not to mention Im not 100 sure these frameworks would help me in the way I beleive they will. p  pstrongThe Questionstrongbr I am looking for some discussion as to whether these frameworks are worth the learning curve in a smallscale, database layer type applications.  p  pIn addition, if they are considered overkill, are there any frameworks that COULD help with this type of system I have considered transitioning the UI to the web which seems perfect and is more my expertise. p  pThanks for your time.p

Negative 1124 pI have a C application which links to a few c DLLs which in turn use bindings to call c functions in other Dlls.p  pThis all works fine if I compile the c Dlls with MTd but when I use MDd I get an XMLParseException in my C app complaining that it cant find any Dllsit fails to find the first of my Dlls that I use. My best guess is that using this other switch causes it to change the path where it looks for its Dlls, causing it to fail. I used DependencyWalker to have a closer look and the two Dlls it actually fails to find are IESHIMS.DLL and WER.DLL. I cant see my c Dlls anywhere in the tree in DependecyWalker however. Anyone have any ideas what might be wrong herep  pAlso, using the nondebug equivalents MD and MT make no difference. Regardless, I cant use MT as it causes another bug.p  pEDIT Ive narrowed the problem down somewhat. When compiled and linked using the VS2010 command prompt, my app works fine, with the VS2008 command prompt it still fails to find the Dll. Does anyone know any differences between these two version of VS which could cause the behaviour I described abovep  pThanks in advance,p

Negative 1124 pIm planning on using GAEs TaskQueue API to refresh my cache of HTML pages, which I save in the Datastore and memcache, but Datastore is more reliable. p  pOnce a week, i addedit some data, and need to regenerate associated HTML pages, and triggering tasks is the way to do.p  pNote that different edits may imply changing the same cached page. For instance, the homepage has snippets from several parts from different data. What I want is to launch tasks to the task queue with a emdelayem using countdown of an hour, for example so that I can accumulate several edits, and in the end, the cached pages will be regenerated only once.p  pThe problem is, I dont need to add a task to regenerate page X if there is already a task queued to regenerate page X in a hour. Thus, I need to check the task list and see if there is already one. p  pHow can I access the task listp
Negative 1124 pI want to log some summary lines on domain shutdown, however log4net hooks the AppDomain.CurrentDomain.ProcessExit first and will shutdown the logging before I have a chance to output my message.

Does log4net provides any hook which it invokes just before shutdownp

Negative 1124 pI have several divs that are nested within each other. Each has its own onclick event. So, imagine that its like a sandwich, the bottom layer is bread this layer is geographically larger than the ones that are nested inside,then theres lettuce and then tomato on top.p  pSo, it looks like thisp  precode  Bread                                                   Lettuce                                              Tomato                                         ltclickgt                                                              codepre  pCurrently, when the user clicks on the tomato, it fires off the proper sequence for the tomato, but then things go awry. Because as soon as it fires tomato, it recursively fires lettuce, and then finally the bread.p  pI suppose it does this because technically the user DID click within those divs, but only because tomato is nested inside them.p  pThe way it emshouldem work is that if the user clicks on the Tomato portion of the sandwich, then it should fire off only tomatos event. On the other hand, if the user clicks on the lettuce portion that is peeking out behind tomato, then it should fire lettuce.p  pSo, my question is whether it is possible to make the divs opaque for clicks so that even though they are nested inside each other, only the one that was actually clicked on counts.p

Negative 1124 pAfter years of Web Forms development Ive decided to give MVC a go. Ive been able to work through most of the other stumbling blocks, but Im kind of stuck on this one.p  pIn Web Forms I would create controls for each of my forms in order to modularize so I could reuse them throughout my sites. I am attempting to do the same thing in MVC but with partial views and am not having much luck. Its probably something simple, and maybe Im just not searching on the right set of keywords to find the obvious example.p  pLets say I create a strongly typed partial view for a Login form. I want to include it on several pages of my site. Since the code is separate from the view, how do I encapsulate the logic so it can be easily reused in several views In Web Forms, I just stuck it in the codebehind. In MVC do I have to put the code in every view controller where I want to use the controlp  pSecond, how do you handle posts from partial views Ive tried creating strongly typed views and partial views, but the view models dont seem to populate automagically like they do when the form is directly on the view. I could always use the FormCollection as the action parameter and just force the values into my partial view models, but that doesnt seem too elegant. Can someone point me to some functional examples of how to use multiple strongly typed partial pages with forms on a single view e.g. A login page with a login control and a register controlp

Negative 1124 pIm trying to implement a custom classloader for tomcat.  My first attempt yielded a class cast exception apparently, tomcat tries to cast my loader to org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappLoader.  Fine, I extended WebappLoader and added the catalina.jar to my buildpath.p  pNow Im ready to deploy I think.  Im getting this errorp  blockquote   pSEVERE Catalina.start    LifecycleException  start     java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError   orgapachecatalinaloaderWebappLoaderp blockquote  pTomcat comes with catalina.jar to run, so Im 99.9 sure its already loaded into tomcat.  I verified this by checking serverlibcatalina.jar, which does contain the apache WebappLoader.  Furthermore, manually linking another catalina.jar in creates a whole mess of problems, as expected.p  pIm confused.  Any tips would be hot.p  pThanksp  pUpdate Interestingly, the same thing on tomcat6 extending WebappLoader worked on tomcat5.5, still causes a ClassCastException.  Sounds to me like the class performing the cast was loaded using a different loader from the one which loaded my class.  I dont see how I would have control over that anyway, unless maybe another missing tomcat config somewhere  Any ideas for tomcat6 eitherp
Negative 1124 pI have a question about XML parsing.

Negative 1124 pI have these two methods I am working on. One saves and one loads. Obviously both need some sort of error handling so I have implemented some catch all handling. Now the heel of the hunt is, what happens next is contextual to where, during runtime, the error occurs. Because of this I would like to handle the error in the caller, one level above. That way I can have different logic for different situations.p  pAn example would be. If I check the load on first run and it fails I can assume that they memory may have been cleared. But if I try to load during execution I can assume the memory wasnt cleared by correct means and something must be up.p  precode    public void SaveToStorageAccountCollection Collection              try                      var storage  IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings             storage[defaultCollection]  Collection             storage.Save                  catch Exception ex                       Do something meaningful here                    public AccountCollection LoadFromStorage              try                      AccountCollection collection             var storage  IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings             storage.TryGetValuedefaultCollection, out collection             return collection                  catch Exception ex                     Do something meaningful here                   return null      codepre  pEssentially I am asking can I throw the error up to the caller but still retain the original error details.  p  pEDIT Both John and Andrew having given correct answers.

Negative 1124 pI have compiled a JNI dll that I would like to load into my Java application using codeSystem.loadLibrarycode. This works perfectly fine on Windows XP with the dll compiled using MSVC 2008 Express.p  pHowever, on Windows 7, where I compiled the dll using MSVC 2010 Express same options, same processor architecture, same Java version, just different OS and compiler the application would freeze upon the codeloadLibrarycode call. No error messages, no reaction at all. When I try codejstackcode on the frozen process it freezes as well no output, no termination. Running the application as an administrator does not fix this problem.p  pThe DLL and all its dependencies are in the codejava.library.pathcode. In fact, when I removed them, the Java application would tell me theyre missing, so the dll must have been initialized properly and something else fails. Debugging proves, however, that its actually codeloadLibrarycode freezing and nothing afterwards.p  pCan anybody tell me what might be going on herep  hr  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pAs stated in my comment below, this problem seems to go deeper. Using a simple C program to load one of the dependencies of said DLL already makes the freeze occur, so this must be some kind of problem with the Windows API and how MSVC linked the DLL that dependency was linked by MSVC 2010 Express as well.p

Negative 1124 ppHellobrI am developing web application using Spring 3.0, Hibernate and JSP pages as a view technology. And I am stuck on the problem of linking pages together. pHere is the situationbrI do have simple jsps up and running for adding, editing same form and displaying all elements using datatables. So far everything works as I am only accesing the grid with all records from index page, from where I can open an edit page back button just links to the grid and a controller method for adding points to grid also.brBut I do have some records connectedullirequisitionliliresolutionliliappelationliulObviously I can display each of those on their own as well as edit. But each requisition has list of associated resolutions so when you display a resolution update form, grid with associated resolutions should be present and you should be able to open edit form for picked resolution where situation repeats with appelations for the resolution. Problem is that I would like to have back button on each edit form which would take you one step back sort of a stack.ppAfter several hours of coding and lot of thinking I was not able to come up with the solution how to pass this stack info from one page to another.ppI would be thankful for any advice either framework or solution.brPS. If you need some source code just write and I will post it here ASAP but I consider this question more to be about an idea and general solution than crafting some solution for my particular code.brPS2. Problem also is that I do not know how many layers of associations will be needed so some general solution is needed.pThank you for you advice and patience.brJohnnniep

Negative 1124 pI currently have a very basic cluster composed of two Tomcat 6.0.32 instances strongTomcat1strong and strongTomcat2strong running on the same VPS.

Negative 1124 pPreviously we have developed against the ReportServerReportService2005.asmx web service. p  pTo access these web services, the MSDN documentation suggests the old .NET 2.0 based web service reference technologies. But we specifically chose to use the WCF System.ServiceModel technology to access this service. Regardless of whether you use .NET 2.0 WSDL or WCF Service References, in both cases proxy classes are generated to wrap the web service methods. Noteworthy, the proxy classes themselves will have different but functionally equal implementations. emRef a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms155134.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms155134.aspxaem p  pWe have had great success with the WCF based service proxy against the ReportService2005 for SSRS 2008. Recently, we were asked to do the same but to use the new ReportService2010 web service for SQL Server 2008 R2 as the old ReportService2005.asmxReportService2006.asmx services have been deprecated. emRef a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms154052.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms154052.aspxaemp  pemFor context The ReportService2006.asmx services are intended for using SSRS in a Sharepoint Integrated mode  presumably this has mostly to do with security authenticationauthorisation.emp  pIn the most simplest terms the new ReportService2010.asmx services are an almalgamation of the old ReportService2005.asmx and ReportService2006.asmx services, and you are now able to use the ReportService2010.asmx services for either Native or SharePoint Integrated scanarios.p  pAfter all that, my question is what else is different at an API level  PS I also found that SSRS2008R2 no longer supports codeAnonymouscode usage For example I noticed that in the old services used to specify that the WCF Client security mode was set for TransportCredentialOnly using NTLM and passing your Username from the ClientCredentials. In contrast, the new 2010 services has the WCF Client security mode now set to None and the message still contains the UserName, but without any transport security like NTLM.p  pOK, so Im starting to guess that the act of integrating the 20052006 services which likely used different authentication mechanisms results in this change we see.p  pThis though, has a direct impact on the API code in that previously you would be specifying the credential for the Client proxy as followsp  precodeproxy.ClientCredentials.ClientCredential  yourCredential codepre  pThis no longer seems relevant. I also noticed that many of the proxy service methods now expect a codeTrustedUserHeadercode instance as the first parameter. For examplep  precodeproxy.CreateFolder yourTrustedUserHeader, folder , ...  codepre  pFrom some documentation it appears to be implemented as a SOAP Header. This TrustedUserHeader object contains properties like codeUserNamecode, codeUserTokencode, codeAnyAttrcode, etc. but Im not sure what the proper usage pattern is. Unfortunately the MSDN documentation is equally useless in that I could not find clear guidance on this issue, nor do the MSDN documentaion use WCF ServiceModel to access the services.p  pCan anyone please provide some insight as to the appropriate way to now use the new Reporting Services 2010 interface  Should I no longer set the ClientCredentials property, and instead create and instance of the TrustedUserHeaderp  pMany thanks Jaansp

However, when I try to do this with NumPy, theres one thing that I cant pickle easily the codeufunccode.p  pIve read this thread that suggests pickling the codenamecode and codemodulecode of the codeufunccode, but it seems they rely on having numpy fully built and present before they rebuild it.

Negative 1124 pSome years ago I added a webservice interface to an existing web application that would allow the creation of custom clients to manipulate the data held by the application. The clients were primarily .NET, whereas the web application was Java hosted in a Tomcat server, and since back then the interoperability between these two platforms was not so great, I created my own little homegrown auth scheme, using a binary security token spliced into the requestresponse xml by handlers on both sides.p  pSince then, technology has progressed on both sides theres the Metro project on the Java side which emphasizes interoperability with the .NET world unfortunately Ive been busy with other projects and havent kept up with the details as much. But from what I have read about it so far, shouldnt it be possible to do something similar emproperlyem using relatively new standards like WSSecurity, WSPolicy and the likesp  pIve been given the chance to update the code from back then, and I would really like to do it right this time. Something that bothered me about the old solution was that the presence of the security token was not reflected in the wsdl anyone implementing a client would have to know about it from some other source, and include some classes provided by me for the handler, the token and some extra lines of code to hook them up to the web service  something that, as far as Ive understood the WS specs, should be possible with WSPolicy or WSSecurityPolicyp  pBut somehow I have been unable so far to find any resources examples, tutorials, etc. online that would explain how one would even begin to go about implementing something like that.p  pSo, given uptodate technology and standards like a server using the Metro framework, and a client in .NET 3 or 4 using WCF, would it be possible to create a web service that uses basic userpassword authentication to Log In i.e. create some kind of session, or conversation to the service, then allows carrying out any operations on the service while the session remains valid, and invalidates the session once the user either explicitly Logs Out or a timeout expiresp

Negative 1124 pUltimately, Id like to know how to store a UIView globally, if necessary from one view controller, so that it can be referenced, and called back up to the top, from within another view controllerp  pIve built an app that has a Home tab and a Guide tab as the two main tabs, but the Guide tabs functionality is a bit unique in that its a dynamic tab, which will ideally show different content depending on what guide has been chosen from the Home tab. Thus, on the Home tab, there are several UIButtons that are meant to load a given guide. Each guide is simply a collection of images that the user can interact with. No problem there.p  pNow, on the Home tab, when a user selects the guide they want to view, I wanted to transition between the Home tab and the Guide tab with a CurlDown animated transition. This is the only place Ill have a UIView transition animationmeaning normal tab switching by the user will be the standard instant transition without effects. p  pHeres how I have implemented the HometoGuide transition when a user selects a guide from the Home tab. This is done in the HomeViewController, as an IBAction assigned to all the guideloading UIButtons, each of which has a unique tag that tells the GuideViewController which guide to loadp  precode IBActionloadGuideidsender  UIButton button  UIButton sender GuideViewController guideController  [[GuideViewController alloc] initWithNibNameGuideViewController bundlenil] self.guideViewController  guideController [self.guideViewController activateGuidebutton.tag] [UIView transitionFromViewself.view                     toViewguideController.view                   duration1.0                    optionsUIViewAnimationOptionTransitionCurlDown                 completionBOOL finished                     UITabBarItem tabBarGuide  [[self.tabBarController.tabBar items] objectAtIndex1]                     [tabBarGuide setEnabledTRUE]                     self.tabBarController.selectedIndex  1                 ] [guideController release]   End IBActionloadGuide codepre  pThis works really well, up until the point where I then have to enable the Guide tab and switch to it. What happens at that point seems to be that another instance of the GuideViewController is created and replaces the one that was initially instantiated and transitioned to from the HomeViewController as shown above. p  pSo I thought maybe I could work around it by, instead, moving the guideloading to a new view, on that isnt used with the UITabBar, then load and transition to this view from the Home tab, just like I did in the above code. Then, after switching tabs, Id need to somehow  recall it into my Guide tabs view controller, as a subview or the like. p  pId think the view would still exist in memory after the tabswitching process, I just dont know how to access it, so I can show it again after the Guide tabs view has hidden it. Should I assign the view to some sort of globally accessible variable from the HomeViewController so that I can then access it from the GuideViewController Guide tabs view p  pIm open to any alternate suggestions as well, if you think this approach is bad form I initially tried to overcome the problem by loading the details of the active guide into the database, then recovering that data when the Guide tabs view controller kicked in. However, the Guide tabs view must be cached or something, because if the user goes back to the home page and chooses a new guide, itll animate the transition to that guide, but then when the HometoGuidetabswitch kicks in, it flips back to the same state that the Guide tabs view was in before the user went back to the home page to choose a new tab. Also, I noticed the ViewDidLoad method doesnt get called again when manually nor programmatically switching tabs, so I figured that the other view must still be around in memory too The other view being either the original instance of the GuideViewControllers view initiated from the Home tab upon selecting a guide button, or a new view as previously mentioned that would essentially do the same thing, albeit in a separate class.p  pSo to summarizep  ul liI have two tabs, Home and Guideli liHome has several UIButtons that when tapped will load a specific guideli liWhen a UIButton on Home is tapped, it transitions from the Home tabs view to the Guide tabs view view CurlDown, without first switching to the Guide tab because that would lose the CurlDown effectli liThen I have to trigger the tab switch programmatically, which seems to load a new instance of the Guide view, which effectively covers up the other instanceli liI want to know if I can somehow just call back up the first instance by somehow maybe storing the other instance as a global or some such li liHense the question about how to pass a UIView instance around several UIViewControllersli ul

Negative 1124 pIm working on converting a website using php. Part of my process is verify that image paths dont point to nonexistant images i.e. there are no broken images. Since many pages share certain images, I set up a cache array to see if Ive already checked for the existence of an image file for a given path. p  pUsing raw path string as the array index didnt work, so I used codemd5code, and that does the trick. However, the conversion script is taking a long time, and it seems clear that thats because of the md5 calculation  Ive been running the conversion frequently over the past few days, and I noticed right away that as soon as my caching started working, the script took much longer to run.p  pSo Im wondering if there is a faster hash algorithm that I can use in my cache, and of course I need one that wont produce collisions. Since this is a oneoff script, I dont need a supersecure unbreakable algorithm, just one that gets the job done a little faster. p  pa hrefhttpwww.php.netmanualenfunction.hash.php104987 relnofollowThis commenta apparently is a list of all the hashing functions that php has available to it.p  pstrongEditstrong I didnt draw a lot of attention to this in my comment, but when I use the plain string of the path as the index for the cache array, it didnt work. As soon as I changed it to md5 hash, it worked. If I had more time I would troubleshoot this, but this is a oneoff project that I cant spend more time than I absolutely must one. p  pstrongPost Editstrong Okay, apparently Im doing something way wrong with my caching I must have changed something when I changed the indexes to hashes that caused the cache to start working, irrespective of the hashing. People are saying my hash should be okay with file path strings, and that md5s dont take that long anyway. So, I dont know what Im doing wrong and I dont have time to figure it out in this project.

Negative 1124 pI have an Android app with a receiver that listens for 2 intents, 1 that spawns a thread to write to a file and 1 that spawns a thread to upload the same file to a server.p  pI have a script on my host machine that needs to manually send intents to the receiver via adb shell am broadcast.  I want to send an intent to write to a file and then send another intent to upload it. However, both creating and uploading the file can take an unknown amount of time and I need to wait for the file to finish being written before uploading it.p  pIs there a way for my Android app to somehow signal to my host script that writing is done  Or is there a way I can poll the app with my script and the app returns the status of the filep  pThe only thing I can think of is creating a temp file when the real file is complete.  The script polls for the existence of this temp file and uses it as an indicator that the real file is ready to upload.p

Negative 1124 pIm having a problem with Linq to SQL performance on Windows Phone 7, but Im really not sure what Im doing wrong I have almost no experience with Linq to SQL, and the more I read, the more confused Im getting emsighem.p  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI have a local SQL CE database with five tables, two columns in each codeintcode primary key amp codenvarcharcode value, plus indexes, and about a 100,000 entries in each table.

This is before I add any of the other requirements, like multiple where clauses, ranking, ordering etc. Even if I search for what I know to be the first row in the database, it still takes around 5 seconds.p  pIf I change approach and search for something very common like the, it only takes around strong100msstrong to execute. I know codeLikecode with wildcards is more complicated than a straight codecode comparison, but I dont know why the performance is so different.p  pI know its a useless comparison, as theyre apples and oranges, but I previously executed similar queries on the same database written in MySQL, and they consistently got results in around 0.30.4s regardless of what I searched for.p  pAm I missing something really obvious Ive followed Microsofts examples and read many tutorials online, but I cant find a reason why this query is so slow.

Negative 1124 pIve read a few articlesposts regarding the use of Getters and Setters, and how they help to defeat the purpose of encapsulation in domain model objects. I understand the logic behind not using setters  you are allowing client code to manipulate attributes of that object, outside the context of the object business rules and invariants.p  pNow this principal does still confuse me. For example, what happens if I need to change the value of a member variable of an object For example, if the name of a person changes how can I reflect this in the model At first I thought, well why not have a function called ChangeName which lets me pass in the new name and it in turn can change the internal name variable. Well.... thats just a setter isnt itp  pWhat I need to clarify  if I were to completely eliminate setters, then in situations such as the above, am I supposed to solely rely on constructor parameters Should I pass the new attribute value in place of the old attribute value via a constructor, after which I can persist the changes by passing the object to whatever persistence infrastructure I havep  pThese two articles are useful in this discussionp  ol lia hrefhttpkellabyte.comtagddd relnofollowhttpkellabyte.comtagdddali lia hrefhttptypicalprogrammer.comp23 relnofollowhttptypicalprogrammer.comp23ali ol

Negative 1124 pThere are many questions about the issue of combining generics with varargs. This would require generic arrays which dont exist when actual code tries to instantiate them. Moreover, theres a good amount of documentation on the compilervagueness of warnings from varargs methods with nonreifiable parameters. Because of type erasure this creates potential heap pollution, hence the warning in Java 6 at the caller. However, my question is not about these problems themselves. I think I understand that some things arent possible. emWhat Id like to know is the way to elegantly workaround these problems in my complex case.emp  pLinks for related topicsp  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1445233isitpossibletosolvetheagenericarrayoftiscreatedforavarargsparamIs it possible to solve the quotA generic array of T is created for a varargs parameterquot compiler warninga where some call this situation a bad feature bug.li lia hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialjavagenericsnonreifiablevarargstype.html relnofollowhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialjavagenericsnonreifiablevarargstype.htmlali ul  h2My caseh2  pI have a codeBookItemSearchAddTaskcode that extends from the emAndroid codeAsyncTaskcodeem but somewhere along its inheritance hierarchy has been made generic, more abstract at higher levelsp  pAt a higher level its strongcodeSearchAddTaskcodestrong, which contains the method strongcodestartcodestrong to execute the task, called from a client that knows that it passes a codeBookItemcode product in.p  precodepublic abstract class SearchAddTaskltProductToAdd extends Product amp NamedProductgt          extends AddTaskltProductToAdd, ProductToAddgt       public void startViewActivity context, ProductToAdd product throws SpecificAddTaskDomainException, TaskExistsException, TaskUnavailableException          super.startcontext, product             more stuff ...             executeproduct       codepre  pA level lower its an strongcodeItemSearchAddTaskcodestrong.

Actually only one autorelease statement was neededp  precode Set up the builtin twitter composition view controller. tweetViewController  [[[TWTweetComposeViewController alloc] init]autorelease]   Set the initial tweet text. See the framework for additional properties that can be set. [tweetViewController setInitialTextHello. This is a tweet.]   Create the completion handler block.

[self dismissModalViewControllerAnimatedNO]   ]   Present the tweet composition view controller modally. [self presentModalViewControllertweetViewController animatedYES] codepre  pIf you send the tweet or click cancel in tweetViewController you would expect that the tweetViewController is deallocated. Instead the object remains in memory including the attached image if you have attached one in the tweet . So, if the user tries to make another tweet the apps memory grows bigger because tweetViewController leaked.p  pAs you notice, tweetViewController  isnt mentioned inside the block so it isnt automatically retained.. p  pI used instruments and proved a hrefhttpdl.dropbox.comu1785075testTwitter.zip relnofollow1a that [[TWTweetComposeViewController alloc] init] causes a memory leak.p  pAnother thing I tried in order to prove it, was to  NSLog,tweetViewController  a few runcycles after the controller has been dismissed. Normally the program should have crashed because tweetViewController would not be pointing to a TWTweetComposeViewController instance. Instead it printed correctly the previous instance, proving the memory leak.p  pThe only way I have found in order to avoid this is by violating the memory management rules and is the followingp  precode[tweetViewController setCompletionHandlerTWTweetComposeViewControllerResult result        Dismiss the tweet composition view controller using animated YES     [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimatedYES]     [tweetViewController release]  ] codepre  pIf you dismiss it without animation, a memory leak occurs...

Negative 1124 pHaving just built a c application to run SQL scripts, Ive run into a few issues with error handling.p  pWe have a stored procedure in our database which modifies the default constraint for tables by dropping any existing one and then creating the new one, and it runs fine when we call it from SSMS.  However, when we call the same stored procedure from the .Net SqlClient, it gives an error.  The error I get in the codeSqlExceptioncode has the messagep  precodeSystem.Data.SqlClient.SqlException Column already has a DEFAULT bound to it. Could not create constraint. See previous errors. codepre  pThis shouldnt happen, since we never see the message in SSMS unless we dont run the drop statement first.  If the codeDrop Constraintcode statement is commented out, we see the same message.p  pWhy would the constraint not get dropped when we call the stored procedure from in .Netp  pFor reference, the relevant code inside the stored procedure isp  precode  SELECT strSQL  ALTER TABLE [  strTableName  ] DROP CONSTRAINT  [  strConstraintName  ]   EXEC spexecutesql strSQL    SELECT strSQL  ALTER TABLE [  strTableName  ] ADD CONSTRAINT DF  strTableName    strColumnName   DEFAULT   strDefaultValue   FOR   strColumnName   EXEC spexecutesql strSQL codepre  pEDIT I considered trapping for errors, and ignoring nonfatal errors such as this.  However, unfortunately this specific error is a Level 16 error, and errors such as updating a nonexistent table are only Level 15.  So I cant let this error pass by filtering on the Error Class of the exception.p  pEDIT 2 Should have mentioned, the codestrConstraintNamecode is determined automatically based on the table name and column namep  precodeSELECT         strConstraintName  vdc.CONSTRAINTNAME   FROM         dbo.vwDEFAULTCONSTRAINT vdc   WHERE         vdc.TABLENAME  strTableName         AND vdc.COLUMNNAME  strColumnName codepre  pstrongResolutionstrongp  pSo, it turns out that the vwDEFAULTCONSTRAINT that was determining the name of the default constraint was badly written.p  pIt was filtering based on the value of USERID for some reason the view was written before I started which wasnt necessary. Removing this restriction from the view returned the correct constraint name.p  pErikEs answer provided a good push in the correct direction. Saving the variable values into a temporary table allowed me to see that the 2 methods werent actually working the same, which led me to investigate the view further. Kudos to ErikE for this, which is why I selected his as the correct answer.p  pI do find it strange though that the value of USERID was not the same, since the connections were identical.p

Yet, i hit run again, and it copies the manager name.  it seems to always be one copy behind, or selects the second most recent item on the clipboard.

Negative 1124 pI was playing around with twitter bootstraps accordion plugin, and Ive noticed that in IE, if you use jquerys append to add elements to the accordions body, the body doesnt expand to incorporate the newly added element, which causes half of the element and everything below it to be cutoff. Is there a fix for this Ive tried adding overflowauto for the css corresponding to the accordion body, but that just makes the user have to scroll down to see the rest of the body. Is there something thatll cause the accordion body to expand automatically to incorporate the new element without cutting anything off, in IEp

Negative 1124 pI am new to the whole frontend client scripting scene and have encountered a few difficulties when working on my most recent project.  I have looked around the website and could not find anything that answered my question.  There may be something here and I have just not found it because of my inexperience and if there is it would be nice if you can provide a link to those resources.p  pI am currently working on building a client that makes ajax calls to a crossdomain asp.net web api that I have built.  I know that the web api works as it has been tested in fiddler.  I have also managed to successfully make calls on a click event.p  pThe problem is that I cannot seem to get this working on page load and with knockoutjs.  I have tried to do a simple list that is populated with data when the page loads but when I load the page and check fiddler I can see that the ajax calls are not being made.  This possibly explains why when I load the page the content isnt there.  I have tried inserting some static data to view model and the binding worked so it seems it may be the case that there is something blocking the ajax calls.p  pI have looked at examples and have knocked up some code.  I cannot see any problems with the code but as I am inexperienced there is certainly a possibility that I am missing something.  There may also be more efficient ways to do model binding, if so, I would appreciate any advice from someone more experienced.p  pThe code isp  precode ViewBag.Title  KnockoutTesting    lt MAIN gt     ltdiv idmaingt         lt wrappermain gt         ltdiv classwrappergt             ltul databindforeach placesgt                 ltligt                     ltspan databindtext titlegtltspangt                 ltligt             ltulgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt  section scripts  ltscript typetextjavascript src....Scriptsjquery1.7.2.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript src....Scriptsknockout2.1.0.jsgtltscriptgt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt      function PlacesViewModel          var self  this          function Placeroot, id, title, description, url, pub              var self  this              self.id  id             self.title  ko.observabletitle             self.description  ko.observabledescription             self.url  ko.observableurl             self.pub  ko.observablepub              self.remove  function                   root.sendDeleteself                           self.update  function title, description, url, pub                  self.titletitle                 self.descriptiondescription                 self.urlurl                 self.pubpub                                 self.places  ko.observableArray          self.add  function id, title, description, url, pub              self.places.pushnew Placeself, id, title, description, url, pub                   self.remove  function id              self.places.removefunction place  return place.id  id                    self.update  function id, title, description, url, pub              var oldItem  ko.utils.arrayFirstself.places, function i  return i.id  id              if oldItem                  oldItem.updatetitle, description, url, pub                                  self.sendDelete  function place              .ajax                 url httplocalhost1357apiplaces  place.id,                 type DELETE                                 function           var viewModel  new PlacesViewModel          ko.applyBindingsviewModel         JQuery.support.cors  true         .gethttplocalhost1357apiplaces, function places              .eachplaces, function idx, place                  viewModel.addplace.PlaceID, place.Title, place.Description, place.URL, place.Public                      , json       ltscriptgt  codepre  pIt has been simplified for the sake of getting it to work before I add more functionality.p  pThanks for your time.p

Then I also have an array of tower objects from a class Tower which kill them when they come in proximity.p  pFor both these operations of moving multiple enemies and firing from towers I am using setInterval as below to change their states and firing animations independent of each other by using the set intervall in the instance of the respective classes. thatTower.attackInterval  setIntervalfunction  ...fire code here... ,50p  pDifficulty I am facing is these setIntervals tend to mix up with the other instances and on few occasions combine together and play all enemy responses as one but not independent..p  pI want these to work independently.

Negative 1124 pOK folks, I have been going around this problem for about 2 weeks now trying everything I can think of and looking at tons of answers on here that feel like they are going to answer it, but I just cant work out how I am meant to do what I am trying to do and it is driving me absolutely NUTS No one seems to have an answer anywhere, there are half answers all over the place, but none seem to actually do what I need it to do, surely SOMEONE has solved this problem before Please excuse the REALLY long question, but its important that the question is asked right, so that the answers actually answer the need Dp  pp  pAlso please dont bother reading any further if you are likely to provide any answer which does not take into account that my datastoreserver is Google App Engine GAE, and my Client is written in Google Web Toolkit GWT and everything is written in Java, I dont know anything about Python or MySQL or PHP or anything like thatp  pFinally if anyone knows of a better place to figure stuff out like this, PLEASE do let me know as I keep coming up with issues like this and have no idea how to find a solution other than in here, or spend hours and hours searching google for someone else who has already managed to figure it out. I also dont understand how to figure anything out from JavaDocs  sorry, but until someone explains it to me, Im just not going to get itp  pI have a datetime stored on the server in UTC obviously I also have stored on the server a TimeZone for each business owner stored as a string eg codeAmericaNewYorkcode. This string is obtained by using codejava.util.TimeZone.getAvailableIDscode on the server and getting the business owner to select the relavant timezone for their business default is codeEuropeLondoncode if they dont choose anything  no need to get hung up on that bit I need to pass any datetimes back to the client PC at some point in the future, IGNORING the local timezone on their PC, because the datetime needs to be displayed according to the timezone of the business owner.p  pSo as an example the business owner is a hairdressers in London and they have an online appointment schedule which is available to be viewed by any potential customer of theirs. One of these customers also in London wants to book an appointment, sees a slot at 9am BST on Monday 3rd September and books it.p  pThis is then stored in the Datastore as the UTC time which is actually 0800 as BST is UTC1, and of course the business owner has selected codeEuropeLondoncode as their timezone. Everything fine so far.p  pNOW, at some point in the future, the customer is on a business meeting in New York, and realises that they have an appointment the following week for a haircut in London and they want to move it by a week, so they then try to VIEW the appointment in the hairdressers appointment book, but they dont want to see it as 4am New York Time, they want to see it as 9am British time.p  pSo my problem is that when the customer clicks to VIEW appointments on 3rd September, the server can send back a UTC datetime of 0800 and a codejava.util.TimeZonecode ID String of codeEuropeLondoncodep  pBut because on the client I can only use p  precodecom.google.gwt.i18n.client.TimeZone codepre  pit doesnt allow me to use the functionp  precodeTimeZone bizTimeZoneTimeZone.getTimeZoneEuropeLondon which works for java.util.TimeZone codepre  pas it causes the error p  precodeThe method getTimeZoneString is undefined for the type TimeZone codepre  pit suggests changing it to p  precodecom.google.gwt.i18n.client.TimeZone.createTimeZoneEuropeLondon codepre  pbut this version, is expecting a GWT codecom.google.gwt.i18n.client.TimeZoneConstantscode object example shown at the end of this message and not the simple string that the codejava.util.TimeZone.createTimeZonecode will accept.p  pI can create this by usingp  precodefinal TimeZoneConstants constTz  GWT.createTimeZoneConstants.class final TimeZone timeZoneCali  TimeZone.createTimeZoneconstTz.europeLondon codepre  pBut I dont know how to do this when Im starting with codeEuropeLondoncode andor I dont know how to store this object into the App Engine DataBase and then retrieve it later.p  pIncidentally amongst the commented text I have also tried using the following linesp  precodeCalendar tmad  new GregorianCalendarTimeZone.getTimeZoneEuropeLondon Calendar cal  Calendar.getInstancesomeTimeZone DateFormat df1  new SimpleDateFormatyyyyMMdd HHmmss df1.setTimeZoneTimeZone.getTimeZoneEuropeLondon final TimeZone timeZoneClient  TimeZone.createTimeZoneEuropeLondon dtf.formatdate,timeZoneClient codepre  pThere MUST be a standard way of doing this SURELY, I really cant be the first person to ever have to solve this issuep  blockquote   pconstTz.europeLondontransitions [19394, 60, 24770, 0, 28130,   60, 33506, 0, 36866, 60, 42242, 0, 45602, 60, 50978, 0, 54506, 60,   59714, 0, 63242, 60, 68450, 0, 71978, 60, 77354, 0, 80714, 60, 86090,   0, 89450, 60, 94826, 0, 98521, 60, 103561, 0, 107257, 60, 112297, 0,   115993, 60, 121033, 0, 124729, 60, 129937, 0, 133633, 60, 138673, 0,   142369, 60, 147409, 0, 151105, 60, 156145, 0, 159841, 60, 164881, 0,   168577, 60, 173785, 0, 177313, 60, 182521, 0, 186217, 60, 191257, 0,   194953, 60, 199993, 0, 203689, 60, 208729, 0, 212425, 60, 217465, 0,   221161, 60, 226201, 0, 230065, 60, 235105, 0, 238801, 60, 243841, 0,   247537, 60, 252577, 0, 256273, 60, 261481, 0, 265009, 60, 270217, 0,   273745, 60, 278953, 0, 282649, 60, 287689, 0, 291385, 60, 296425, 0,   300121, 60, 305329, 0, 308857, 60, 314065, 0, 317593, 60, 322801, 0,   326329, 60, 331537, 0, 335233, 60, 340273, 0, 343969, 60, 349009, 0,   352705, 60, 357913, 0, 361441, 60, 366649, 0, 370177, 60, 375385, 0,   379081, 60, 384121, 0, 387817, 60, 392857, 0, 396553, 60, 401593, 0,   405289, 60, 410497, 0, 414025, 60, 419233, 0, 422761, 60, 427969, 0,   431665, 60, 436705, 0, 440401, 60, 445441, 0, 449137, 60, 454345, 0,   457873, 60, 463081, 0, 466609, 60, 471817, 0, 475513, 60, 480553, 0,   484249, 60, 489289, 0, 492985, 60, 498025, 0, 501721, 60, 506929, 0,   510457, 60, 515665, 0, 519193, 60, 524401, 0, 528097, 60, 533137, 0,   536833, 60, 541873, 0, 545569, 60, 550777, 0, 554305, 60, 559513, 0,   563041, 60, 568249, 0, 571777, 60, 576985, 0, 580681, 60, 585721, 0,   589417, 60, 594457, 0], names [GMT, Greenwich Mean Time, BST,   British Summer Time], id EuropeLondon, stdoffset 0p blockquote

Negative 1124 pI am creating a NSManagedObject subclass with certain attributes. At the same time, I am executing some codea block that does some network operation given the attributes of my NSManagedObject. Now, some times that network operation might fail or take too long, so I want to add the ability to cancel the execution of that codeblock.p  pI was thinking of making the codeblock an NSThread, and then I have the ability to call [theThread cancel]. However, how do I associate the NSThread with my NSManagedObject, given that I cannot add properties to NSManagedObject Categories Is it OK to just add the property to the definition of the NSManagedObject itself Seems legal, but subsequent changes to the Core Data model would overwrite my code, I guess.p  pBut maybe there is an entirely different and better way to accomplish what I am trying to do Any ideasp

Negative 1124 pThis is a sortof question, that I am just hoping some astute individual can give me some guidance on.p  pI have an iOS project that has numerous screens ViewControllers that all share a top and bottom bar an UIImageView with a button on each.  I am using a storyboard because I want to be able to easily visualize the entire graph of screens.p  pIs there any way in Xcode 4.5 to make a sort of UI Template, or somehow subclass the view in IB so that whenever I make a new screen VC it inherits the top and bottom bars and the associated functionalityp  pI was hoping if I created a UIViewController subclass, put an IBOutlet for each ImageView and Button into it, and the associated IBAction for the two buttons, then subclassed it when making my VCs I would be able to link it all up, allowing me to only have to duplicate the visual elements on each screen.  But alas, when I do that I get not KVCcompliant errors on the subclass when linking it to the existing outlet and actions.p  pThe other thought I had was to programmatically add the visual elements from a superclass, but then, for me, the problem is in IB I have to remember to account for the missing space at the top and bottom, which I will have to live with if that turns out to be the only option...p  pIs there some way to do this that I am not seeing or do I really have to code this all over and over for each screenp  pAny insightinputideas greatly appreciated.p

Project1 is the one whose codeMyActionscode classs codeDoJobcode method has some extra bits specific to only Project1.  Now here is the twist.. Project1 is eventually going to be scrapped and its dll will no longer be used.I want to write the code in the best possible way that ensures there is no repeat of code and so that I dont have to make any modifications to remove any unrequired code in Project2 once Project1 is discontinued.p  pI was thinking of using inheritance and overriding the DoJob method. How would that work if their return types are different and they have different input parameters Perhaps push one of the parameters from Project1s MyActions class to its constructor I was also thinking of adding a link to Project2s MyActions class in Project1. But not sure about how to go ahead with implementing that and not repeating myself or possibly running into unforeseen problems later. Any tips, suggestionsp

Negative 1124 pI am interested in obtaining the number of nano seconds it would take to execute 1 double precision FLOP on GeForce GTX 550 Ti. p  pIn order to do that I am following this approach I found out that the single precision peak performance of the card is 691.2 GFLOPS, which means the double precision peak performance would be 18 of it i.e. 86.4 GFLOPS. Then in order to obtain FLOPS per core, I divide the 86.4 GFLOPS by the number of cores, 192, which gives me 0.45 GFLOPS per core. 0.45 GFLOPS means 0.45 FLOPS per nano second per core. If I am following the correct approach, then I would like to know how many threads per core are run to obtain these GFLOPS numbers and where can I find this info p  pMoreover, my small test shown below executes in 236000232 cycles by one thread only. In order to find the time in nano seconds it takes to execute 1 iteration of the loop, I do 236000232106  236 cycles. The shader clock of the card is 1800Mhz, which means it takes 2361.8  131 nano seconds to execute one iteration of the loop. This number is much bigger than the one above 0.45 nanoseconds per core. I am sure that I am missing something here, because the numbers are very different.

So counting the cateogry in one query is mandatory.p  pAny help is highly appreciated.p  pedit for the sake of clearity the counter as count was just a brainfart  I dont know why I tried it this would have resulted in an index. I needed a way to count how often the category occured in those 15k entries.p

Negative 1124 pI am trying to figure out the most efficient way to compare a value against a potentially enormous dataset. The problem is I dont know exactly what I am looking for. I have done some research on sorting and searching algorithms noncs major here but most of what I have found returns differences or sorts the data. While this may come in handy I am trying to figure out a way to or if I am thinking of this correctly to minimize the results to be calculated.p  pThe application will compare a given users latitude and longitude when making a post latlong tied to post not user to every other post in the database to return all posts  within a given distance lets say 5 miles. p  pThe first version of my application still in development simply compares the post to every other post in the database to return the exact distance between posts and displays only those within a 5 mile radius. It works fine with test users numbering in the dozens, but I realize that when it goes live there could one day be millions of usersposts and performing these calculations in PHP on the entire database would not be ideal. p  pAn idea I had is to create a temporary table with posts from just the last 72 hours that have a latitude of  5 minutes 5 miles of the querying post and then use PHP to calculate the actual distance of this smaller set effectively eliminating nonrelevant longitudes. I could explore using longitude in this query as well but since it has a varying distance it would not be incredibly accurate. Possibly using an overstated 5 degrees in longitude will still fall within 5 miles at the poles and still reduce the size of the dataset at the equator I dont anticipate having many users at the poles btw.p  pIs this sound or is there a better way p  pAny ideas or suggested readings p

But, If a function needs a codeIntNotZerocode, then a codeIntcode is illegal.p  pFor examplep  precodediv  Int gt IntNotZero gt Int div  div  aFunction  Int gt Int gt Int If we casually write it, then the compiler will complain for type conflict. aFunction  div  aFunction2  Int gt Int gt Int we have to distinguish between Int and IntNotZero. aFunction2 m n  type n of An assumed grammar like case ... of to separate subset from its complement. case ...of only works on different patterns.                    IntNotZero gt m div n                    otherwise  gt m  n codepre  pFor a more useful examplep  precodedata HandleNotClosed  Handle not closed this type infers a Handle not closed  hGetContents  HandleNotClosed gt IO String this function needs a HandleNotClosed and a Handle will make a type conflict. hGetContents  hGetContents  wrongMain  do          ...          h lt openFile xxxaa ReadMode          ...  we do many tasks with h and we may casually closed h          contents lt hGetContents h this will raise a type conflict, because h has type of Handle not HandleNotClosed.          ...  rightMain  do          ...          h lt openFile xxxaa ReadMode          ...  we do many tasks with h and we may casually closed h          type h of  the new grammar.               HandleNotClosed gt do                                    contents lt hGetContents h                                    ...               otherwise       gt ... codepre  pIf we combine ordinary IO with Exception to a new supset, then we may get free of IOErrors.p

In my blade template Ive got the following codep  precodeif Inputhasfield     ltli classoption activegt else     ltli classoptiongt endif codepre  pHowever, codeInputhascode seems to always return false.  I know that the data is there however because I can populate the form field itself like thisp  precodeFormtextfield, Inputoldfield codepre  pThe same codeInputhasfieldcode call will return true in the post method on my controller however.

Negative 1124 pFirst Id like to know how this can be achieved in general, and then maybe someone knows how to accomplish this using Capybara.p  pExample codeltimg srchttpexample.comgetrandomimagegtcode Thing is, codesrccode points to a script which returns random image, not to the image itself. Page is loaded, script is run, image is displayed. I can easily get the codesrccode value, but if I access the link to download the image, the script runs again and returns a totally different picture. And I need the one thats already on the page.p

Then, I need to switch the dialog to nonmodal while the command is running, and up date the dialog.  This all seems to work fine.  But, the problem is I cant get the dialog to redraw until after the pre, run, and post methods have finished.  So, if I have the setupUi like thisp  precodedef setupUiself      create a ui for this command     diag  QDialog     if diag.exec         diag.setModalFalse         diag.show codepre  pI tried processEvents but that didnt seem to do it.

Negative 1124 pI have a checkbox which is resized together with my main form. The text of this checkbox has some relevant information, so it got an own tooltip control with mutliline content.p  pIf the form gets small enough the text of my checkbox is truncated AutoEllipsis  true. But if i move my mouse over this control i get two tooltips which overlap each other. The first shows the complete text of the truncated checkbpox and the second shows the tooltip i added in the code.p  pI presume that the first tooltip is caused by setting the AutoEllipsis property to true What can i do to prevent this builtin tooltip to be shown I didnt find any properties i could overload or something... If possible I would like to keep the AutoEllipsis property as it handles the truncation of too large text.p

Negative 1124 pI am upgrading my app from iOS6 to iOS7 and I am having some issues with my UIViewControllers layout.  In iOS6 I was able to resize my UITextViews dynamically by getting the contentSize property of the textView and then setting its frame property.  I would do all the resizing in the viewWillAppear method so that way the view would be resized before it was visible.  Now in iOS7 it doesnt work. The only way the contentSize property works is if I set in the viewDidAppear method. I hate doing that because it causes the view to jump after its already visible. Has anyone figured out how to solve this problemp  pHere is my code that no longer works in iOS7p  precodevoidviewWillAppearBOOLanimated      self.textView  [[UITextView alloc]initWithFrameCGRectMake5, 0, 310, 0]     self.textView.text  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Negative 1124 pI use codefo.netcode with success to generate onepage invoice pdf documents from codexslfocode template and xml data. Now I would like to generate the pdf documents in a loop and write them to a codeStreamcode, so that I have the documents merged into just one batch pdf. Whenever I reach a certain number of documents I will create a new batch file and go on.p  pMy problem I generate the pdf documents one by one and append them to the batch file without errors, but the final pdf file shows only the first document. The file size has increased accordingly to the appended data but those pages are not shown. If I save each individual document they are OK, one page each. But the same documents appended to the file stream are not visible when opening the resulting file.p  pI tried with codefosimplepagemastercode and codefopagesequencemastercodewith a codeforepeatablepagemasterreferencecode, with no success. As far as I have googled, I guess codefo.netcode is not intended to be used this way.p  pMy question is this Is there a way to append pdf content to an existing pdf file or stream with codefo.netcode Or it simply can not be donep  pI would like to confirm it before moving on to implement another solution, such as using some free tool to merge existing pdf documents my best candidate for now is a hrefhttpwww.pdflabs.comtoolspdftkserver relnofollowPDFtka.p  pAnother posible solution could be to generate the transformed xslfo containing already several pages, but I dont like this approach by performance reasons. The intermediate files would be quite great. I would prefer to keep in memory only one page at a time.p  pPerhaps my full approach to this problem is wrong, I would appreciate some ideas.p  pMy environment code.NET 4.0code, codeVisual Studio 2010code.p

Negative 1124 pI have observed that when the address in the address bar is selected and an enter key is pressed,the doGet method is invoked and not the doPost method. How to invoke the doPost method ,and not doGet.p
Negative 1124 pMy table structure looks like this,p  ol liID  primary index, AI.li liTitle  Title of the product or any item.li liTags  This will have tags about the product or item. Seperated by commas. Example if the product is an Android Mobile, the tags may be Android, Mobile, [Brand], [Operating System].li ol  pNow I would like to display the products in groups. Like first I will display a box with category Mobile phones. And the next box with Android mobiles or any particluar brand mobiles.p  pAnd I query the database using this logic,p  precodeSELECT  FROM database.tablename WHERE tag LIKE Mobile codepre  pSo that this will return the mobile phones in general.p  pNow again p  precodeSELECT  FROM database.tablename WHERE tag LIKE Samsung codepre  pThis query is for sorting out by brand Samsung.p  pNow the problem definition is I need to omit the results which were previously displayed in the previous query. I mean the mobile models displayed in the first query must not be displayed when I query for brand Samsung. Since the queries are run seperately I dont know how can I do this. Any ideasp
Negative 1124 pFor various boring reasons, I need a boxed int class that mostly acts as an int, but is a class that inherits from a base so it can work with other parts of a object hierarchy. I included a constructor that takes an int, as well as an int cast so I can easily intermix my boxed int with regular ints in code. However, Im seeing a very odd behavior that I cant figure out When I return my boxed int from a function, Id like it to use my copy constructor that takes a reference to another BoxedInt. However, instead it casts my boxed int to and int, and then uses my int constructor. This causes problems because in my actual codebase, there are other baseclass properties I want to copy in this case, and they are lost by taking this castconstructor path. Here is the code in questionp  precodeclass BoxedInt  private     int mint public     BoxedIntmint0              traceLConstructed with nothing           BoxedIntint valmintval              traceLConstructed with int           BoxedIntBoxedIntamp val              traceLConstructed with reference         mint  val.mint           operator int              traceLCast to int         return mint        BoxedInt funky      BoxedInt TempInt  1     return TempInt   int mainint argc, char argv[]      traceLStart     BoxedInt test1  1     traceLCopying     BoxedInt test2  test1     traceLAssigning from return value     BoxedInt test3  funky     traceLDone     return 0  codepre  pWhen this is run, heres the outputp  precodeStart Constructed with int Copying Constructed with reference Assigning from return value Constructed with int Constructed with reference Cast to int Constructed with int Done codepre  pSo when I assign one value to another, the reference based constructor is used, as Id expect. However, when I assign the return value of my function to a BoxedInt, for some reason the compiler decides to cast to int, then use the int constructor. My C is rusty and Im having trouble getting to the bottom of this odd compiler decision that I cant seem to counteract. Any ideasp

Negative 1124 pWe have a website where users put up ads for stuff they want to sell, with parameters such as price, location, title and description. These can then be searched for using sphinx and allowing users to specify min and maxprice, a location with a searchradius using google maps etc. Users can choose to save these searches and get emails when new ads appear that fit their search. Herein lies the problem We want to perform a reverse search every time an ad is posted. With the price, location, title and description as parameters we want to search through all the saved searches and get the ones that would have found the ad. The min and maxprice should just be performed in a query i suppose, and some Quorom syntax to get all ads with at least 2 or mby just 1 occurance in the titledescription. Our problem lies mostly in the geosearch. How do we find all searches where the searchcircles would include our newly posted location without performing a search for every saved searchp  pThat is the mainquestion, any comment on our suggested solution to the other problems is also very welcome. Thank you in advance  Jennyp

Negative 1124 pThe title basically says it all. I am running Debian GNULinux 7.0 wheezy on the Pi and .Net on the server. This will be for a consumer device so I expect it to just be behind someones wireless router.p  pI am trying to find someone code this for me and everyone I talk to has a completely different plan of attack and would appreciate some input. p  pMy original plan was to use signalR for most of thisp  ol liIs there a way to simply get signalR to work on the RaPili liWill mono work to port the signalR code over Ive heard mono doesnt work for the pili liIs there a simple way to accomplish this without signalR which would still easily implement the security features already built into itli liA couple people said I may have to worry about port forwarding issues, why if it works in a web browser without issues. li liI can load up a web browser on the Pi and hit my windows site using signalR to push data and it works fine. Sounds fairly simple to me to copy the basic functionality of a browser in .netmy primary language, is it really that much more complicated in Linuxli ol  pOverall my main goal is to get data pushed to the RaPi, not polled as others have suggested. p  pAny suggestions would be great.

All of the mechanics of the table appearing on No checked has already been done.

Negative 1124 pWhat is the easiest way to convert a string of Latex e.g. Consider the polynomial x2 into a pdf within a Python web app  Ideally, this wouldnt require the creation of intermediate files that I would have to store in a database.  p  pI tried downloading Texcaller a hrefhttpvog.github.iotexcaller relnofollowhttpvog.github.iotexcallera but I could not get it to work.  In particular, the key file pythontexcaller.py has the line import texcaller which gives the error No module named texcaller.  p  pIm thinking that there must be some way to do it because the Texer resource at AoPS a hrefhttpwww.artofproblemsolving.comResourcestexer.php relnofollowhttpwww.artofproblemsolving.comResourcestexer.phpa renders Tex as PDF almost instantaneously.  p  pThank you very much in advancep
Negative 1124 pI wrote a little editor for Qt.  It takes in a pointer, and based on the type of attribute determined by a string, it will pull data from it using a templated function.p  pemFor example, if the type is point, it will call codegetBoundValueltQPoint3gtcode on the pointer.emp  pThis works fine in practice.  But Im setting it up as a library so others can use it and I assume theyll want to add support for other types.  The problem is I dont want them to have to modify the original source code, but either inherit from the class or register callbacks for new types. I dont know how Id implement the latter option since I couldnt pass a string type and class type together, could I p  pIf I want to allow users to add support for their own types, would they have to implement a subclass of my attribute editor that handles these values  Or is there a way I could reorganize my code so users can maybe pass in the functionality to handle the new type like rectangle, and a type Rectangle thats calls codegetBoundValueltRectanglegtcode p  pHeres some example code, where I see if the object is of a certain type.

The system always load the default layout. I cannot understand why. When I delete the default order, it always load the small layout, even on my Galaxy Note 2. And on the AVD with the smallest screen, the app is closed with an error while starting. However, the normal layout runs on the smallest screen...p  pI even tried this to support the layout, but no success codeltsupportsscreens          androidsmallScreenstrue         androidnormalScreenstrue         androidlargeScreenstrue         androidxlargeScreenstruegtcodep  pEvery xmlfile has the same name.

Its probably a very unusual solution, so I was wondering if Im approaching this the wrong way and if theres a more obvious way to write proper destructors in C.p

Negative 1124 pHi I am using PrimeFaces to create a data table which has 1 column within it and each row of that datatable holds a accordian.  i want to update a specific row within the data table with the values from some input boxes associated with each row. p  pWhen I submit the form per row  firstly the set property action listener is never called and  secondly the setters for the fields I am updating are called multiple times. In fact they are called once for every row in the data table. p  pThe problem being that when debugging I can see that no matter which ever row I am editing the setters are called for all the rows in the datatable. So unless i am editing the last row the values I am setting always get overwritten.  Any one know whey this is happening as i thought it would only have called the setter once per row edit.p  pUPDATE Worst case i can get around the setters being called by putting a null check in. however I do not know which row I am working with since the set property action listener is not calledp  pJSF pagep  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml

Negative 1124 pI had a strange error in my program and it came down to a for me unexpected behaviour when doing a substraction between an int and a vectorsizetype. Here is a simple examplep  precode    include ltiostreamgt     include ltvectorgt      typedef stdvectorltdoublegt statetype      int n  1      int main          statetypesizetype i  0        stdcout ltlt i  n ltlt stdendl       codepre  pI expected this program to prints 1, but it prints compiled with icc 14.0.1 under 64bit Linux p  precode    18446744073709551615 codepre  pMy current explanation is that sizetype is unsigned and this leads to some weird  conversion  I only found this error after a long time and I am very surprised this happens.

Negative 1124 pI am looking for a way to speed up my code. I managed to speed up most parts of my code, reducing runtime to about 10 hours, but its still not fast enough and since Im running out of time Im looking for a quick way to optimize my code. p  pstrongAn examplestrongp  precodetext  pd.readcsvos.path.joindir,text.csv,chunksize  5000 newtext  [np.arraychunk[,2] for chunk in text] newtext  listitertools.chain.fromiterablenewtext codepre  pIn the code above I read in about 6 million rows of text documents in chunks and flatten them. This code takes about 34 hours to execute. This is the main bottleneck of my program. strongeditstrong I realized that I wasnt very clear on what the main issue was, strongThe flattening is the part which takes the most amount of time.strongp  pAlso this part of my program takes a long timep  precode    traindict  dictiziptext,labels     result  [traindict[test[sample]] if test[sample] in traindict else predictions[sample] for sample in xrangelenpredictions] codepre  pThe code above first zips the text documents with their corresponding labels This a machine learning task, with the traindict being the training set. Earlier in the program I generated predictions on a test set. There are duplicates between my train and test set so I need to find those duplicates. Therefore, I need to iterate over my test set row by row 2 million rows in total, when I find a duplicate I actually dont want to use the predicted label, but the label from the duplicate in the traindict. I assign the result of this iteration to the variable result in the above code.p  pI heard there are various libraries in python that could speed up parts of your code, but I dont know which of those could do the job and right know I do not have the time to investigate this, that is why I need someone to point me in the right direction. Is there a way with which I could speed the code snippets above up p  pstrongedit2strongp  pI have investigated again. And it is definitely a memory issue. I tried to read the file in a row by row manner and after a while the speed declined dramatically, furthermore my ram usage is nearly 100, and pythons disk usage increased sharply. How can I  decrease the memory footprint Or should I find a way to make sure that I dont hold everything into memoryp  pstrongedit3strong As memory is the main issue of my problems Ill give an outline of a part of my program. I have dropped the predictions for the time being, which reduced the complexity of my program significantly, instead I insert a standard sample for every non duplicate in my test set.p  precodeimport numpy as np import pandas as pd import itertools import os  train  pd.readcsvos.path.joindir,Train.csv,chunksize  5000 train2  pd.readcsvos.path.joindir,Train.csv,chunksize  5000 test  pd.readcsvos.path.joindir,Test.csv, chunksize  80000 sample  listnp.arraypd.readcsvos.path.joindir,Samples.csv[,2]this file is only 70mb sample  sample[1] testset  [np.arraychunk[,2] for chunk in test] testset  listitertools.chain.fromiterabletestset  trainset  [np.arraychunk[,2] for chunk in train] trainset  listitertools.chain.fromiterabletrainset labels  [np.arraychunk[,3] for chunk in train2] labels  listitertools.chain.fromiterablelabels  zipping train and labels traindict  dictiziptrain,labels finding duplicates results  [traindict[test[item]] if test[item] in traindict else sample for item in xrangelentest] codepre  pAlthough this isnt my entire program, this is the part of my code that needs optimization. As you can see I am only using three important modules in this part, pandas, numpy and itertools. The memory issues arise when flattening trainset and testset. The only thing I am doing is reading in the files, getting the necessary parts zipping the train documents with the corresponding labels in a dictionary. And then search for duplicates.p  pstrongedit 4strong As requested Ill give an explanation of my data sets. My Train.csv contains 4 columns. The first columns contain IDs for every sample, the second column contains titles and the third column contains text body samplesvarying from 100700 words. The fourth column contains category labels. Test.csv contains only the IDs and text bodies and titles. The columns are separated by commas.p

Negative 1124 pI am learning to code in C using KampR II.  I am tired of console apps and decided to get into a GUI environment.  Decided to use Code Blocks and wxWidgets.

I think it is a feature of wxWidgets that lets you print back to a GUI form rather than a console as printf does.  It works.p  pI would put the code on here, but I do not know how.  Tried before and get a message about it not being formatted properly.p  pThanks for the replies.p

Negative 1124 pEver since I did sockets programming on a PDP11, its been the case that IP fragmentation will take care of the case where an IP datagram such as a UDP datagram is larger than the MTU for the segment allows.p  pThus, I can send a UDP datagram of size 30 kB, and it might fragment to 20 segments of 1.5 kB on Ethernet, and then fragment each into three segments of lt576 bytes later on for some particular wireless link, and as long as all the fragments make it to the other end, the UDP datagram makes it to the other end.p  pThen, I came across the documentation for the UDP socket in node.js, which claims that routers will drop datagrams that do not fit the MTU of the next segment. I thought this was only the case for datagrams with the dont fragment bit set in the header, but given that node.js is supposed to be a high quality product with some credibility in network circles, Im wondering whether I missed something and  many routers will now treat all datagrams as if they are dont fragmentp  pHeres the link a hrefhttpnodejs.orgapidgram.htmldgramsocketsendbufoffsetlengthportaddresscallback relnofollowhttpnodejs.orgapidgram.htmldgramsocketsendbufoffsetlengthportaddresscallbackap  pHeres the quotep  precodegenerally sending a datagram greater than the receiver MTU  wont work the packet gets silently dropped, without informing  the source that the data did not reach its intended recipient. codepre  pSo, did I miss something, or does the node.js documentation need an updatep

Negative 1124 pI am in the process of translating some of my code over, and I have noticed a peculiar behavior with the typing enforcement. I am not sure it is peculiar, it may very well be expected, but I am curious as to how to get around it. p  pFor this example, I am using codeKendo UIcodes codekendoWindowcode widget, but almost any type from any kind of library is sufficient to demonstrate it.p  precodeexport function UserWindowoptions     var settings  .extend       default settings    , options     var WINDOW  ltkendo.ui.Windowgt      WINDOW  ltdiv idkendoeditorwindow gt        .kendoWindowsettings  this is where we have now declared the type, basically        .datakendoWindow      here, I want to add my own little method to kendoWindow for the purpose of how     I intend to use it    WINDOW.databind  functione    this is where we run into trouble         some code goes here         return WINDOW  codepre  pNow under normal Javascript, this does not give me any trouble. But code.databindecode is not a defined function of codekendoWindowcode, and therefore it is actually balking at me adding it like this.p  pI have been able to get around it by not declaring the variable as a type of codekendo.ui.Windowcode, but I would like to discover how to APPROPRIATELY handle this situation, in other words, extend the type properly so that I get intellisense and the whole type safety thing if it is at all possible.p

I make a separate API call to the service for each value.p  pIm just wondering if I can rely on my handler running every time till its finished, or if therell be some occasions when the loading of the next pages JavaScript will interrupt it before it can register all the values in the list.p  pThe a hrefhttpsapi.jquery.comunload relnofollowjQuery documentationa on .unload says It is not possible to cancel the unload event with .preventDefault.

Negative 1124 pI hope this is not a recurring question, but i dont seem to find anything on what i am trying to do. I am to store a small data structure about 40 bytes in size on a flash memory of the microprocessor as a look up table. The device can be interfaced to the PC, so that the end user can configure this tablewithout being able to program the micro to suit the needs of his particular system. It would make sense to me to store it in an array and it would be convenient for me to access this data in code, however then i would need some way of forcing this array to point to a specific memory location. Section of flash where the table is to be stored is not really flash  but EEPROM and is configured and partitioned by me. Any ideas on how I could go about it  using kinetis K60DX256 micro, not much experience in storing data structures Thanksp

Will it explode exponentially Will it be scalable etcp  pIn the case of 2 users with 2 coins, youd have user 1 being able to trade his two coins with the other users two coins, and vice versa. That makes it 4 total possible trade relationships that can be set up. However, keeping in mind that if user 1 offers A for B... user 2 cant offer B for A because that relationship already exists.p  pWhat would the equation be to figure out how many TRADES can happen with U users and C coinsp  pCurrently, I have one of two solutions, but neither seem to be 100 right.

Negative 1124 pOK, here is the thing.

I mean when I check this option and reload the page it is only then PHPSTORM picks the connection. And it always start debugging from INDEX.PHP file and never execute or reach to the break points I set in a different file.p  pThe file that I want to debug is inside many folders stronge.g. abcdfile.phpstrong and there is no way I can directly execute that file by entering its path in the browser. So I need to know how can I debug the code which is inside strongabcdfile.phpstrong.p  pIf I explain it more precisely I am trying to debug a function inside appcodecoreMageCoreControllerVarienAction.php its a Magento project. And even after setting up break points in strongAction.phpstrong file, PHPSTORM does not execute the code inside those break points.p  pI will be greatfull if somebody can tell me how to debug the code which is inside of folders hierarchy in PHPSTORM.p

Negative 1124 pBackground when I drag an image from the finder in OSX, I can drop it into many locations a web browser, or into Photoshop to be opened, for example.p  pI wish to replicate the same functionality in my OSX app, allowing the user to drag a codeNSImagecode from a codeNSImageViewcode. Of course, I found Apples a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacsamplecodeCocoaDragAndDropListingsCocoaDragAndDropDragDropImageViewm.html relnofollowDragDropImageViewa example. I also found a hrefhttpsgithub.comphaibinDragDropDemo relnofollowthis GitHub projecta which extends the functionality further. This works perfectly for allowing me to drop an image onto my desktop or into the finder, in which case it copies the image into a file at the location.p  pBut the system, otherwise, does not seem to recognize it as an image. That is Photoshop will not accept the drop, nor will browsers, etc. Ive noted that code NSArray namesOfPromisedFilesDroppedAtDestinationNSURL dropDestinationcode is not called in these cases, which makes me feel like something about the codeNSPasteboardTypecode or codeNSDragOperationcode is not configured properly.p  pI cant seem to make much headway with the documentation, here, and most of the examples are more focused with receiving drops into the codeNSImageViewcode.p  pThus, in short, I want my codeNSImageViewcode a hrefhttpsgithub.comphaibinDragDropDemo relnofollowsubclassa to allow the user to drag the image into Photoshop, etc.p

They just have some text in it.p  pHere is what im talking about p  precodeltdiv idmaindivgt    ltdiv id div01gt       lth4gtSometext01lth4gt    ltdivgt    ltdiv id div02gt       lth4gtSometext02lth4gt    ltdivgt    ltdiv id div03gt       lth4gtSpecial Textlth4gt    ltdivgt    ltdiv id div04gt       lth4gtSometext04lth4gt    ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pI would like to get the parent divs id of the h4 which text is Special text so, here, in this example, it is div03.p  pBut, unfortunately, these ids are auto generated by Sugarcrm, for those who know, and i cant know by advance the ids name. So that is why i have to pass by the h4.p  pI know i can use the jQuery function below to pass through all h4p  precodeallMyH4.each codepre  pAnd i know i can use the jQuery function below to find the parent of my desired h4p  precodemyFoundH4.parent codepre  pBut im getting some trouble on searching the h4 by their text or html p  pCould you please help me on thatp  pThanks a lotp  pstrongEDIT few hours later strongp  pThanks to Bhushan , i could do what i really wanted. It just has a restriction  my user MUST not change h4 texts NOR giving several h4 the same name containing my string. For another solution, try rory too, it did not work for me, but it had been tested by others, and it seems to be better than contains.p

Negative 1124 pIm currently working on a showcase app using BLE beacons from BEACONinside. I have set up my app to range two of my beacons thus having 2 codeRegioncodes. This works fine and I receive all the callbacks and all the beacon info I need.  p  pIm monitoring the reported distance and noticed that it will not update the distance values right away, but gradually. Looging each callback I see the reported distance decreasing slowly, even if I run towards the beacons. That means, even with a for testing very low scanning interval, I reached the beacons and still have to wait up to ten seconds for the reported distance to reflect the proximity.  p  pIs there a reason for that, and can I tweak a setting to have it updating right away  p  pMy scenario is simply two beacons placed at different points and I want to trigger an action when I get closer to them. So using ranging instead of monitoring would be the way to, right At the moment I compare the last three measurements and see if I got closer to the beacon.  p  pThanksp

Negative 1124 pWhen writing ASP.NET CRUD applications in C, I often find myself inserting a lot of repetitive boilerplate codes for fetching SQL Server queries into data tables, fetching scalar values from queries into variables, calling stored procedures, and so forth. p  pRecently, Ive been trying to refactor this by creating generic classes and methods to handle these basic tasks. However, in order for these to work properly, they need to be able to take an arbitrary number of parameters. The builtin codeSqlParameterCollectioncode class seemed the obvious first choice, but unfortunately this class cannot be instantiated from user code. The next option was to pass a codeListltSqlParametergtcode to the function, and then use codeforeachcode to add its contents to the builtin parameter collection of the codeSqlCommandcode. This worked, but the declaration is a bit clumsy. p  pTo create the list in code before calling the function, I have to do something like thisp  precodeListltSqlParametergt ParameterList  new ListltSqlParametergt      new SqlParameter  ParameterName  Parameter1, SqlDbType  SqlDbType.VarChar, Value  InputVariable1 ,     new SqlParameter  ParameterName  Parameter2, SqlDbType  SqlDbType.VarChar, Value  InputVariable2 ,     new SqlParameter  ParameterName  Parameter3, SqlDbType  SqlDbType.VarChar, Value  InputVariable3   codepre  pThis is hard to read on smaller monitors and still contains a lot of repetitious boilerplate. So my next step was to create a custom class with an overloaded Add method so that this would not be needed. Ive read that it is bad to subclass codeListcode in C, so I used codeCollectioncode insteadp  precodepublic class ParameterCollection  CollectionltSqlParametergt      public void Addstring    ParameterName,                     SqlDbType ParameterType,                     object    ParameterValue               Create the parameter and add it to the list         SqlParameter Parameter  new SqlParameter         Parameter.ParameterName  ParameterName         Parameter.SqlDbType      ParameterType         Parameter.Value          ParameterValue         base.AddParameter           Done         return       codepre  pI can then declare a parameter collection like thisp  precodeParameterCollection Parameters  new ParameterCollection       name          type               value      Parameter1, SqlDbType.VarChar, InputVariable1 ,      Parameter2, SqlDbType.VarChar, InputVariable2 ,      Parameter3, SqlDbType.VarChar, InputVariable3   codepre  pMy question is this Is there any strongquickereasierstrong way to perform this task that Im overlooking And are there any potential hidden strongpitfallsstrong or bad practices in the way Im currently doing itp

But I have primarily seen only relational databases and think of data in term of tuples and relations I think this I can learn with time.p  pI have following questions right nowp  ol liCan I use only redis to store my data  ul liReason why I am asking is that every article I have seen use Redismemcached as an intermediate layer for caching. li liCan I just rely on redis to persist my data through out li ulli liWhere to hostrun redis database  ul liSince Redis is an inmemory database, its requirement of host will definitely be different than applications that require more processing. Hosts which have more RAM will definitely be better here.li liSo where do people normally go on to host their database  li liElasticcaching from AWS, can this be used to host redisas a primary database, not just caching layerli ulli liAny resources   ul liI always ask this, I found lots of good documents online, but nothing really good to start with.

My first reaction is that they are allocated on the stack, not the heap. I would want the heap. Even though they somehow work for me outside of that function, when I try to delete them as I should, it fails.p  pIf I do something such asp  precodeint  allocatedMultiArray  foo int test  allocatedMultiArray[0][2]  We get 3 Success for int i  0 i lt 8 i       delete[] allocatedMultiArray[i]  FAILS  delete[] allocatedMultiArray  WORKS If we skip the above for loop of course codepre  pI was reading this page on multidimensional array and he specifically had to the above for loop to deallocate a 2D array or an additional loop for a 3D array. But, back in my equivalent of foo, he manually allocated the array to the heap with the new operator with a loop as opposed to  1, 2, 3  initializing an array then assigning it like I did. a hrefhttpwww.cplusplus.comforumarticles7459 relnofollowhttpwww.cplusplus.comforumarticles7459ap  pSo if I skip the for loop that fails, am I leaking memory Is what I am doing should even work I really dont want to loop over the multiArray, call new on each index, then manually assign each int.

You can only multiply unlike units, you can additionally add like units and scalars. These libraries are dandy in that they cause compile time errors if you mix units inappropriately. There are 400 units and most of them are defined in terms of other units. When multiplying units, exponents are added, and when dividing units, exponents are subtracted. So to define velocity, I would love a means of expressingp  precodeusing velocitydimension  dividedimensionsltlengthdimension, timedimensiongt codepre  pAnd that should be functionally equivalent to writingp  precodeusing velocitydimension  makedimensionlt1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0gt codepre  pIve been Googling, but I just dont know the terminology to land some hits.

Negative 1124 pI am using Ember Data with the RestAdapter and the following modelsp  precodePizzas.Pizza  DS.Model.extend   name DS.attrstring,   orders DS.hasManyorder,  async true ,   Pizzas.Order  DS.Model.extend   date DS.attrdate,   pizzas DS.hasManypizza,  async true ,  codepre  pI create and save a new order as followsp  precodevar pizza1  an existing pizza with id 1 var pizza2  an existing pizza with id 2  var newOrder  this.store.createRecordorder newOrder.setdate, Date  newOrder.getpizzas.thenfunctionpizzas       pizzas.pushObjectpizza1     pizzas.pushObjectpizza2     newOrder.save  codepre  pThis works well  Ember Data performs a POST on the codeOrdercode model which include the ids of the pizzas in the codepizzascode relationship field. However, I expected that following the save, the order id would be automatically added to the codeorderscode relationship of the 2 pizza objects by Ember Data, but that appears not to be the case. This causes 2 issuesp  ol liWhen I ask for all the orders for a pizza, the new order does not appear since it was never added to the relationship field of the pizzali liWhen a change is made to a pizza e.g. name change and the pizza saved, the new order relationship is lost on the server since it was never added to the relationship field of the pizza and the PUT only includes the order ids last fetched from the serverli ol  pI solve this by amending the last line of code above as followsp  precodenewOrder.save.thenfunction           pizza1.getorders.thenfunctionorders               orders.pushObjectnewOrder                   same for pizza 2       codepre  pstrongemDoes Ember data require that the relationship be created manually on both sides as I am doing or am I missing somethingemstrongp

The user gets 12 guesses to either win  guess the right code.

IN ROW DATA shows fragmentation but for a small page count. LOB DATA shows no fragmentation but high page count.

Negative 1124 pA WPF .NET 4.5 app that I have been developing, initially to work on small data volumes, now works on much larger data volumes in the region of 1 million and more and of course I started running out of memory. The data comes from a MS SQL DB and data processing needs to be loaded to a local data structure, because this data is then transformed  processed  references by the code in CLR a continuous and uninterrupted data access is required, however not all data has to be loaded into memory straight away, but only when it is actually accessed. As a small example an Inverse Distance Interpolator uses this data to produce interpolated maps and all data needs to be passed to it for a continuous grid generation.p  pI have rewritten some parts of the app for processing data, such as only load x amount of rows at any given time and implement a sliding window approach to data processing which works. However doing this for the rest of the app will require some time investment and I wonder if there can be a more robust and standard way of approaching this design problem there has to be, I am not the first onep  ptldr Does C provide any data structures or techniques for accessing large data amounts in an interrupted manner, so it behaves like a IEnumerable but data is not in memory until it is actually accessed or required, or is it completely up to me to manage memory usage My ideal would be a structure that would automatically implement a buffer like mechanism and load in more data as of when that data is accessed and freeing memory from the data that has been accessed and no longer of interest. Like some DataTable with an internal buffer maybep

Negative 1124 pI am creating a page where users can order reports as PDF. I have tried to create it using Angular. When the user changes a report type, this is correctly updated in the debug information present on the page.

As it is now, I have to click on the Create JSON button for it to be updated.p  pThis example can be seen over at JSFiddle as well a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netHenricFwgvd7wLx2 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netHenricFwgvd7wLx2ap  pIMPORTANT The JSON object will not only include the report type, but also a lot of other options not shown here.

Negative 1124 pWe are adding a background image to the body tag. The image is dynamic so has to be loaded last to allow variables to be passed to it.p  pThe issue is, we are trying to improve our PageSpeed and when adding the background image, the PageSpeed report is marking a whole lot of script as renderblocking. Even one we have in our footer.p  pAs far as I know this shouldnt be renderblocking because the content can load fine without it  and it does  but when the background image is called, it becomes renderblocking.p  pHas anyone done anything like this before Any workaroundsp  pIve also spent copious amounts of time trying to get the script to load after the page has finished loading, and I have made it load after the page, but the renderblocking content is still marked in the report.p  pI cant seem to make any sense of it all.

Negative 1124 pIm trying to create a web browser using Cocoa and Swift.

I would think that they should both work or they should both fail.  I didnt expect to see one works but the other fails. Moreover, I have no problem running both rsh and rcp in a Windows Server 2003 R2 computer.  Therefore, I know that the Unix side is OK.  There must be something wrong in the Windows side.p  pI have checked the EventViewer, and there is no error message.p  pI have run Process Monitor in Windows Server 2008 R2 to check the events from running both rsh and rcp commands.  I cannot find anything unusual.  Actually the recorded events from both rsh and rcp look almost the same of course the processIDs are different.p  pI have also tried this in a Windows Server 2008 not R2 computer.

Negative 1124 pIm using two mariadbserver v 10.0.17 in a masterslave environment. From time to time I have to purge the old binary logs on the master which have already been fetched by the slave. p  pI wounder if there is a hidden setting in mariadb to autopurge these binary logs. I think the master knows the amount of slaves and the log an position every slave has reached. p  pOn the on hand its quite useful because you can easily set up another slave if you want and use the existin binary logs for getting to the same position as the master but on the other hand it fills up my diskspace which is sometimes very low.p  pThanks for responding.p

Negative 1124 pIm trying to mix 2 audio clips same format, same length. For each of my clips, I transform them into byte ararys, convert these byte arrays into 2D int arrays, add them, and convert my new 2D int array into a byte array, then write it to the disk.  This works pretty well ... on only one channel. My created file, in this case test.wav, only has sound in the left ear.  In my program, I have a method that allows me to store 2D int tabs into a txt file. I tried analyzing test.wav, converting it into a byte array and then into a 2D int array, the same way I use to convert my original clips. I get two vectors, one for each audio channel. In my first vector, I get what Im supposed to have, an addition of the left channels of my two clips, but in my second vector the right channel, I get a succession of 1 and 0. I am guessing there is something wrong with my TabToByte method but I cant put my finger on it.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated  Thanks in advance.p  pThe code p  precode    public class Main

However, all of these filters seem to strongdostrong something throwing a predefined HttpResponseException, whereas I just want to stop a TaskCancelledException from propagating up the chain.p  pHeres my empty filter attribute classp  precode[AttributeUsageAttributeTargets.Class  AttributeTargets.Method, Inherited  true, AllowMultiple  true] internal sealed class TaskCancelledExceptionFilterAttribute  ExceptionFilterAttribute      public override void OnExceptionHttpActionExecutedContext actionExecutedContext              if actionExecutedContext  null ampamp actionExecutedContext.Exception is TaskCanceledException                          codepre  pWhat can I put in that if statement to stop the exception from going any furtherp  pIs this even possiblethe best way to go about thisp

Negative 1124 pI have a slideshow on every page that contains images of the object the page is about. Each slideshow usually contains 56 image slides.p  pWhat Im thinking is to only set the codesrccode attribute on the first 2 images, and on the rest I only set codedatasrccode attribute to the image file, and then I load the rest of the images after the whole page has been loaded with the help of this Javascriptp  precodefunction loadImages      housecarousel .item img.eachfunction         ifthis.attrdatasrc             this.attrsrc, this.attrdatasrc                 document.readyloadImages codepre  pThe thought process was that since the images are not displayed to the user for the first seconds of viewing the page, I can delay loading them and let the client download the rest of the content on the page first.p  pBut now Im thinking again... Does that really help I mean, images are not render blocking right So does it really matter if I load them while the page is loading, or if I load them after the page has loadedp  pNotice, its not a script that delays until the user views the image, it just delays it until the other resources has loaded first.p  pSo what do you think Does this really help or not Speedtests such as a hrefhttptools.pingdom.com relnofollowhttptools.pingdom.coma doesnt show any difference.p

How would I accomplish thisp  pI am also looking to add other elements such as buttons, which would need to scale.p  pAt the end of the day, imagine and image with a width of 100, and how it scales proportionately, perfectly.

I hope this makes sense.p  pI have looked at scaling text like in this link a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netAye4h relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netAye4hap  pThis is the perfect behavior, but I need more than just text to scale.p

The biggest issue I have with this solution is that the design isnt intuitive.  Hard for future users to know the payment terms is driven by the billing associations table.p  h2Solution  2h2  precodeDistributors  DistributorId Name PaymentTermsId nullable BillingAccountId references DistributorId, also nullable codepre  pIf a distributor doesnt have its own Payment Terms then the column is set to null and through a self reference youll know to use the Payment Terms from the Distributor set as the billing account.p  pAny feedback or suggestions is welcome.p

Negative 1124 pI have once again run out of ideas for an error and returned to the helpful Stack Overflow community for guidance.  I understand that this is a very long post to wade through, but I believe that it could be helpful to others in the community, and provide a challenge for veterans.  p  pEssentially, I am building an app that processes a video frame by frame.  Initially, this process was done linearly, but speed is a major concern for this application.  The natural thought was that seperate threads could be implemented to process the frames.  Each thread would simply be a single iteration of the previous loop retrieving the frame from the video, processing it, and placing the resulting data into the correct index of an array.  p  pThe issue is that during the transition from a loop to threads, a NullPointerException is sometimes thrown Roughly once every 200 frames, when attempting to access the frame returned by MediaMetadataRetriever.getFrameAtTimep  pHere are some sections of the code that may be of usep  pExcerpt from the onClickListener attached to the button that starts the processing.  The onClickListener starts a ThreadPoolExecutor which manages the threads for frame processing.p  precodelong videoLength  getVideoLengthvideoUri coords  new coordinate[intvideoLengthframeIntervalInMicroSeconds] ThreadPoolExecutor executor  new ThreadPoolExecutor     Runtime.getRuntime.availableProcessors1,     Runtime.getRuntime.availableProcessors1,     1,     TimeUnit.SECONDS,     new LinkedBlockingQueueltRunnablegt for long a  0 a lt videoLength a  frameIntervalInMicroSeconds      new ProcessFrame.executeOnExecutorexecutor, long a codepre  pgetVideoFrame, a helper method that takes in a Uri for a video, and a time in microseconds, and returns the frame of the video as a Bitmapp  precodeprivate Bitmap getVideoFrameUri uri, long timeInUSeconds      MediaMetadataRetriever retriever  new MediaMetadataRetriever     retriever.setDataSourcethis, uri     Bitmap temp  retriever.getFrameAtTimetimeInUSeconds, MediaMetadataRetriever.OPTIONCLOSEST     retriever.release     return temp  codepre  pExcerpt from ProcessFrame, the thread as an ASyncTask that is run by the ThreadPoolExecutor.

This package did not eliminate the error, and slowed down the processing time.  p  pOnce the nullPointerException has been thrown, all subsequent threads seem to be more likely to throw the exception again.  p  pRunning the ThreadPoolExecutor with a maximum of one thread does not produce the error.p  pEven if I enclose the entire body of doInBackground in a synchronize block, the error still appearsp

Negative 1124 pI have used MY SQL and Oracle as well, But I have a big confusion. That in oracle does users comes under database or database comes under user.

Negative 1124 pI am trying to split my project up into multiple sub projects, all version managed so others can develop with me and we can easily divide tasks and track time across the project etc blah blah.p  pI have found myself in a situation where some of these sub projects depend on each other.p  pIn isolation these projects dont do much, in order for them to be run they need to be installed into the main project.p  pI have a composer.json for each of the sub projects and where a sub project depends on another sub project I include it.p  pBecause my project is getting bigger, whilst developing each of these smaller sub projects Im finding that composer takes a copy of the dependencies, so each sub project now contains all of the other sub projects.p  pNot only am I getting sick of typing sub project, Im sure there is a better wayp  pSo what Id like this might not be what I should be doing is a way to have each of these sub projects version controlled by git and able to find the other sub projects without having composer create a massive amount of duplication and as a bonus not having to composer update each time I make a change in one of the sub projects.  Id like a seperate git repo for each sub project.  I also dont want to alter my code to include local directories to autoload the classes, Im trying hard to keep composer managing all this.p  pYou could argue that if anyone was actually developing a sub project they would in fact get the main project and update the sub project git repos inside that main project, then push those changes to the master branch for that sub project once they were done.p  pHave I just answered my own questionp  pOne caveat to this is what if I dont want to give access to the main project to a developer because we have someone who will test the sub projects inside the main projectp  pHow could I achieve thisp

However if a person cant stand they automatically get 12 points. also, depending on whether they need any aids and adaptations can affect the scoring.p  pThe intention is therefore to have an ifthenelse function if to respond to person unable to stand, else if to create output dependent on walking distance and need for adaptations, and else to create output based purely on walking distance.p  pEverything works fine if until i include the adaptations drop down. the problem is that to do this i need to create a variable based on the value returned from the distance walked function. at this point the console returns Uncaught TypeError getdistancescore is not a function.the coding has no problem recognising getdistancescore until i do this heres the coding the line that causes the problems is marked this is the problemp  precode  standyesno var standYN []  standYN[mp1]0  standYN[mp2]1    function getstandYN var standscore0 var theForm  document.forms[mobilityform] var standscore  theForm.elements[mobp1] getstandYN   standYN[standscore.value] return getstandYN       end standyesno    distances    var distances  [] distances[mp3]0 distances[mp4]4 distances[mp5]8 distances[mp6]12 distances[mp7]12 note mp5 could be 10   function getdistancescore var distancescore0 var theForm  document.forms[mobilityform] var distancescore  theForm.elements[mobp2] getdistancescore   distances[distancescore.value] return getdistancescore    end distances      needs aid or appliance yesno var aiappYN []      aiappYN[mp1]0      aiappYN[mp2]1    function getaiappYN var aiappscore0 var theForm  document.forms[mobilityform] var aiappscore  theForm.elements[mobp3] getaiappYN   aiappYN[aiappscore.value] return getaiappYN       end needs aids or appliance yesno      CALCULATION STARTS   var aiappscore  getaiappYN   var standingscore  getstandYN     THIS IS THE PROBLEM   var walkingdistance  getdistancescore   END THIS IS THE PROBLEM    if standingscore  1 var actualscore  12       extra else if to go here           else   var actualscore  getdistancescore      CALCULATION ENDS    display results var divobj  document.getElementByIdscore divobj.innerHTMLTotal Score actualscore   var divobj  document.getElementByIdcheck divobj.innerHTMLCheck standingscore  codepre  pApologies if i havent explained this very well, and for the length of the question.

Negative 1124 pI posted a question wondering why my UIImages were staying in the same position as in the interface builder, despite me adding the p  precode    self.nonimage1outlet.center  CGPointx 211, y 10     self.medimage2outlet.center  CGPointx 244, y 10     self.image3outlet.center  CGPointx 277, y 10 codepre  pI have switched from using images to buttons now. My issue was that no matter what CGPoints I put in the code above, the buttons would always go back to the same position as in the interface builder. I was not getting my desired position. I wanted the other buttons to move somewhere else when one of them is pressed, but again, auto layout is preventing this. The buttons quickly move to said position but snap back to place to the original location placed in the interface builder. p  pI got downvoted since I had lack of code, but ive figured out it isnt a code issue, rather auto layout. Disabling it from the file inspector, the button moved to where I wanted it to go. However, disabling auto layout messed up my whole main UI and caused a huge mess. Is there anyway to disable auto layout on a specific element rather than the whole project The reason the button did not go to where the CGPoint specified is due to auto layout locking it in place despite me putting no constraints on it.  p  pEDIT Or just being able to move the UIButton to where I want it to go with auto layout active.p

Negative 1124 pIm trying to use the ECG data stream provided by a Nymi Band to calculate a users Heart Rate. My current approach is to obtain a 10 second sample of ECG data via the Nymi Bands ECG stream, check for the heart beats and multiply by 6 to get the BPM. By subtracting the previous value from the current value and storing it an a List, I get a pretty accurate graph of the ECG stream. The problem is that I am having difficulties accurately determining when a heartbeat actually occurs. p  pMy guess is that I need to apply some form of filter first, to ensure noise does not negatively impact the readings. So heres my question is there a cleaner and more accurate means of analysing the data for possible heart beats Or how could I go about properly filtering the data to remove noisep  hr  pstrongEdit 1strong  code and sample data p  pFirst Approach I used a variation of Chauvenets criterion to try and catch the outliers, which would be representative of the Heartbeat. However, the Standard Deviation was always too high, and the mean too low almost always negative, to accurately detect which values were an outlier.  With the sample data below, the result is 22 beats in 10 secondsp  precodeprivate ListltIntegergt parseDataForHBListltIntegergt ecgValues      double mean  meanecgValues     double standardDeviation  standardDeviationecgValues     Iterator it  ecgValues.iterator      ListltIntegergt heartBeatValues  new ArrayListltgt      NormalDistribution normalDistribution  new NormalDistributionmean, standardDeviation     whileit.hasNext              int ecgVal  Integer it.next         stringBuilder.append,   ecgVal          ifnormalDistribution.cumulativeProbabilitydoubleecgVal  ecgValues.size lt 0.5                      heartBeatValues.addecgVal                   return heartBeatValues  codepre  pSecond Approach Double pass through, finding the average heart beat value. First pass use the max value of the entire data set, as a starting average, then look for all values that are at least 12 of the max value, this data is used to create an average value for all the beats detected in the first pass. Second pass iterate through all the values again looking for any values at least 50 of the new average value. This has proven to be more accurate than the first approach, but still falsely detectsdiscards heart beats. With the sample data below, the result is 7 beats in 10 secondsp  precodeprivate ListltIntegergt parseDataForHBListltIntegergt ecgValues, int averageHeartBeatValue      int previousVal  0

gave a shot at using FFS to transform the ECG data into a Frequency Spectrum in order to calculate the peaks of the actual frequency. However, the results here werent much better when passed through either Approach 1 Chauvenets Criterion or Approach 2 calculation based on the average heartbeat value. Maybe Im missing something here Here were the results using the same datasetp  pTransformType.FORWARD Approach 1  1, Approach 2  266p  pTransformType.INVERSE Approach 1  1, Approach 2  0p  pI think part of the issue is that in order to use FFT, the data has to be a power of 2. As the data streams size varies recording for 10 seconds, a faster heartbeat will generate a larger dataset, I have to pad the end of the dataset if its size is not a power of 2. p  pHeres the new code, for the FFT functionalityp  precode private ListltIntegergt ffsListltIntegergt ecgValues      ListltIntegergt transoformedStream  new ArrayListltgt     FastFourierTransformer ffs  new FastFourierTransformerDftNormalization.STANDARD     double[] input  convertToDoubleArrayecgValues      Complex[] complex  ffs.transforminput, TransformType.FORWARD      forint i  0 i lt complex.length  1 i              double real  complex[i].getReal         double imaginary  complex[i].getImaginary          transoformedStream.addintMath.sqrtreal  real  imaginary  imaginary           return transoformedStream   private double[] convertToDoubleArrayListltIntegergt ecgValues      double[] convertedList      ifisPowerOfTwoecgValues.size              convertedList  new double[ecgValues.size]          else              convertedList  new double[nextPowerOfTwoecgValues.size]           forint i  0 i lt ecgValues.size i              convertedList[i]  doubleecgValues.geti          return convertedList   private boolean isPowerOfTwoint size      boolean isPowerOfTwo  size amp size  size      return isPowerOfTwo   private int nextPowerOfTwoint size      int res  2     while res lt size          res   2           return res  codepre  pSlight modification to the whileloop in the code for Approach 2p  precodewhileit.hasNext              int ecgVal  Integerit.next         ifecgVal gt averageHeartBeatValue  .5                          heartBeatValues.addecgVal                 averageHeartBeatValue  int meanheartBeatValues               codepre  hr  pstrongUpdate 2strong  Continuing to work with the FFT data, but still not certain if Im on the right path here. Using the same method listed above for FFT which uses org.apache.commons.math3.transform.FastFourierTransformer, I searched for the peak value in the FFT results. As this value was too high, I followed another approach I found, here you multiply the peak by the signal frequency in this case, 50, and divide by the sample size.

Negative 1124 pI am trying to open Blueimp gallery through jquery with preferably a specific index.p  pI tried to just using jquery to click on the correct a link like sop  precodevar children  links.children children[index].click codepre  pThis opens the gallery but instantly closes it for some strange reason.p  pI also tried to just do stuff likep  precodeblueimpgallery.open blueimp.Gallery.open codepre  pBut yea those obviously dont work, but cant blame a guy for trying.p  pSo im a bit out of ideas. The reason why i want to do this is because I have the gallery running with 2 different sets of css. So I want to press a button that will gather the current index which i can, then close the gallery, change the css settings and then reopen it by clicking on the corresponding link, but as I said before it just opens and closes it instantly.p  pAny ideasp  pI cant seem to find a method to open the gallery, preferably even with an indexp  pThanks a lotp

The only problem is that some of the data in the second column contains an arbitrary number of commas.

When I run a nonpartitioned job the process ends normally once the job has completed.p  pIs this normal andor expected behavior  Is there a way to tell the partitioned threads to die.  It seems that the partitioned threads are blocked waiting on something once the job has completed and they should not bep  pI know that I could monitor for batch status in the main and possibly end it but as I stated in another question this adds a ton of chatter to the db and is not ideal.p  pAn example of my job specp  precodeltjob idpartitionTest xmlnshttpxmlns.jcp.orgxmlnsjavaee version1.0gt ltstep idonlyStepgt     ltpartitiongt         ltplan partitions2gt             ltproperties partition0gt                 ltproperty namepartitionNumber value1gtltpropertygt             ltpropertiesgt             ltproperties partition1gt                 ltproperty namepartitionNumber value2gtltpropertygt             ltpropertiesgt         ltplangt     ltpartitiongt      ltchunk itemcount2gt         ltreader idreader refDelimitedFlatFileReadergt             ltpropertiesgt                 lt Reads in from file Test.csv gt                 ltproperty namefileNameAndPath valuejobParameters[inputPath]CSVInputpartitionPlan[partitionNumber].csv gt                 ltproperty namefieldNames valuefirstName, lastName, city gt                 ltproperty namefullyQualifiedTargetClass valuecom.test.transactionaltest.Member gt             ltpropertiesgt         ltreadergt         ltprocessor refcom.test.partitiontest.Processor gt         ltwriter refFlatFileWriter gt             ltpropertiesgt                 ltproperty nameappendOn valuetruegt                 ltproperty namefileNameAndPath valuejobParameters[outputPath]PartitionOutput.txt gt                 ltproperty namefullyQualifiedTargetClass valuecom.test.transactionaltest.Member gt             ltpropertiesgt         ltwritergt     ltchunkgt ltstepgt ltjobgt codepre  pEditp  pOk reading a bit more about this issue and looking into the spring batch code, it appears there is a bug at least in my opinion in the JsrPartitionHandler.

Negative 1124 pI need to create an app on facebook for the web platform. This app will retrieve name, email and user image, then this app would post on the users timeline points that this user has made. I was giving some research on the internet and managed to perform this procedure with my account, but when I test with another user account, the app had the message that my application was being tested. I was in my application settings and marked it as public. After making this change, I keep doing all the procedures, but when testo with another user it does not let me hold the post in the timeline that user.p  pWhat could be going wrongp  pAnother question, I must necessarily send the aplicaitovo for reviewp  pThank you very much for your help.
