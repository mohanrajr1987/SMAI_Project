Positive 5614 pI would like to create system modal dialog. I mean a dialog that blocks the entire system screen, not a particular application. So far I found Application modality and Toolkit modality that might be replaced even with manual disabling blocked frames, but still no function to lock the entire screen as in a native application. How can I do thisp
Positive 5614 pI have a large jQuery modal dialog which contains a large form which scrolls up and down. From within this a user can click a link on one of the fields which opens a second modal dialog over the top will a much larger editor for that field. When they click the save button in the second dialog, the contents of the field in the first is updated, all working well.p  pThe problem is that when the second dialog is closed, the first one keep scrolling to the top so the user must now scroll back down to find the field they just edited and continue with the form. Is there a way to prevent thisp  pThanksp

pSo, now Id like to put a checkbox in each item for being able to select several records and delete them at once. Another question, when I edit a record if I put a text the field its filled, but if I put a select it doesnt work. The idea is the select field has all options of countries and letting  that item from the record  already selected. I hope you understand what I need. Thanks.p

Negative 5614 pPHP v5.2.8p  pWindows Server 2003  SP2 IIS 6, I believe, though I cant find a version  anywhere in IIS managerp  pThe full error isp  precodeCGI Error The specified CGI application misbehaved by not returning a complete set of HTTP headers. codepre  pI installed the WAMP stack from bitnami.org, and the PHP pages work completely fine when visiting via Apache, which I have running on port 8888.  However, due to network configuration and firewall reasons, I have to get this working on the IIS server on port 80.  There are other websites running on port 80, including a default website that cant be changed.  Unfortunately, I also have to have this running as a virtual directory, such as www.myserver.comphpapp, instead of as its own website such as phpapp.myserver.com.  The reason for this is that the firewall, beyond my control, requires new passthrough rules to allow access on a new subdomain.p  pThis same WAMP stack from Bitnami is working fine on another server when the php app runs as its own website in IIS, since I can add a new PHP ISAPI filter  but that taboption is not available on virtual directories.p  pIve installed the php Web Service Extension in IIS Manager.  I have tried both phpcgi and the php5isapi.dll in the webserviceextensions.  Furthermore, I have tried both of those as the application extension under the websites configuration mappings.p  pIve also tried mixmatch combinations of the php5isapi.dll and phpcgi.exe for the web service extensions and the websites configuration extension mappings.p  pIve tried tweaking a few things in php.ini, including making sure the docroot is blank.  However, as I mentioned before, this website works fine when visited via the Apache port.  IIS points to the exact same directory.  p  pWhat on earth is causing this error  Ive spent quite a bit of time searching online, and it seems this error pops up for a few different reasons.  If one had a PHP app that did a raw write to the response without writing the headers first would cause this error.  Some PHP apps can cause this error when there is a PHP error resulting in some malformed redirect.p  pMy php error logs are missing in action.  In my php.ini I havep  precodeerrorreporting    EALL displayerrors  On logerrors  On displaystartuperrors  On errorlog  ctempphp.error.log codepre  pBut there is never a log file in ctemp.  I also tried escaping the slashes, and tried forward slashes in the path, and the log file never shows up.p  pAgain, I feel compelled to mention that this all works fine via apache, so it doesnt seem like PHP itself is bailing due to some strange configuration even though I cant find the log file  Not to mention this is the same php.ini that I use on the other computer where this is working fine via IIS where the php app is its own website instead of a virtual directory.p  pI dont know what other info to provide  but Im at my wits end after battling this off and on for several days.  If I drop an HTML page in, I can visit that just fine via IIS under this virtual directory.  What can be causing this  p  pThe app Im trying to run is vBulletin.  Not sure that it matters a whole lot other than to give credence to the correctness of the PHP in the app.p

Negative 5614 pPHP runs in a sharednothing environment, which in this context means that every web request is run in a clean environment.  You can not access another requests data except through a separate persistence layer filesystem, database, etc..  p  pWhat about Ruby on Rails  I just read a hrefhttprubythis.blogspot.com200611gotcharubyclassvariablescopeis.htmla blog posta stating that separate requests might access the same class variable.p  pIt has occurred to me that this probably depends on the web server.  a hrefhttpmongrel.rubyforge.orgwikiFAQMongrels FAQa states that Mongrel uses one thread per request  suggesting a sharednothing environment.  The FAQ goes on to say that RoR is not thread safe, which further suggests that RoR would not exist in a shared environment unless a new request reuses the inmemory objects created from the previous request.p  pObviously this has huge security ramifications.  So I have two questionsp  ol liIs the RoR environment sharednothingli liIf RoR runs in or emmightem run in some circumstances a shared environment, what variables and other data storage should I be paranoid aboutli ol  pstrongUpdate Ill clarify further.strong  In a Java servlet container you can have objects which persist across multiple requests.  This is typically done for caching data which multiple users would have access to, database connections, etc..  In PHP this can not be done at the application layer, it must be done in a separate persistence layer like Memcached.  So the twofold question is which scenario is RoR like PHP or Java and if like Java, emwhichem data types persist across multiple requestsp

Negative 5614 pHow would you identify and fix the following code smellp  pIve got a small scientific computing app that Im writing that has to be able to handle lots of variations on the same theme.  The inner workings of it are wellfactored, mostly using the template method pattern and some higherorder functions.  However, specifying how all these classes and functions should be instantiated and used and with what parameters in any given run of the program is so complicated that I sometimes think the easiest way to do it would be to rewrite main for every run and recompile it.p  pIs there a relatively simple, lightweight way of doing configuration management thats not overkill for a small scientific app  Basically Ive been just using command line switches and theyre getting pretty unwieldy.p  pEdit  The app is small enough that build times are negligible.  I see little advantage in binding to a scripting language over simply modifying the code in the native language.  The app is written in the D programming language.p  pEdit  2  I thought of the config file idea and it would help, but I feel like writing the config file would be almost as hard as rewriting main every time.p

Whilst each of these different worker threads is doing its job, I want to report this progress back to my MAINFORM, however, I cant because it requires CrossThread communication. p  h3Progressh3  pSo far all of the tutorials etc. that I have seen relating to this topic involve customish threading implementations, whereas I literally have a fairly basicish standard THREAD POOL implementation. Since I dont want to really modify any of my code since the application runs like a beast with no quarms  Im after some advice as to how I can go about doing this crossthread communication. ALTERNATIVELY  How to implement a different LOGTOSCREEN method altogether obviously still bearing in mind the crossthread communication thing.p  h3WARNINGh3  pI use this website at work, where we are locked down to IE6 only, and the javascript thus fails, meaning I cannot click accept on any answers during work, and thus my acceptance rate is low. I cant do anything about it Im afraid, sorry.p  h3EDITh3  pI DO NOT HAVE INSTALL RIGHTS ON MY COMPUTER AT WORK. I do have firefox but the proxy at work fails when using this site on firefox. And no, funnily enough, I dont have the internet at home, I literally just moved to this city and the flat is a new build, so the address hasnt been registered with the post office, and thus the phone company cannot find the address on their system till they send a surveyor out, smarty pants.p  h3FURTHER EDITh3  pI DO NOT WANT TO CHANGE MY THREADING IMPLEMENTATION. AT ALL  Accept to enable crossthread communication....why would a backgroundworker help herep  h3CODE RELATED EDITh3  pDoes it make a difference that when my THREAD POOL executes the new threads, it creates a new instance of a class and calls the entire thing on that new thread........i.e. your code example doesnt quite fit....i thinkp
Negative 5614 pIm having a memory problem related to UIImageView. After adding this view to my UIScrollView, if I try to release the UIImageView the application crashes. According to the stack trace, something is calling [UIImageView stopAnimating] after [UIImageView dealloc] is called. However, if I dont release the view the memory is never freed up, and Ive confirmed that there remains an extra retain call on the view after deallocating...which causes my total allocations to climb quickly and eventually crash the app after loading the view multiple times. Im not sure what Im doing wrong here though...I dont know what is trying to access the UIImageView after it has been released. Ive included the relevant header and implementation code below Im using the Three20 framework, if that has anything to do with it...also, AppScrollView is just a UIScrollView that forwards the touchesEnded event to the next responderp  pHeaderp  precodeinterface PhotoHiResPreviewController  TTViewController ltUIScrollViewDelegategt       NSString imageURL     UIImage hiResImage     UIImageView imageView     UIView mainView     AppScrollView mainScrollView   property nonatomic, retain NSString imageURL property nonatomic, retain NSString imageShortURL property nonatomic, retain UIImage hiResImage property nonatomic, retain UIImageView imageView   idinitWithImageURLNSStringimageTTURL codepre  pImplementationp  precodeimplementation PhotoHiResPreviewController  synthesize imageURL, hiResImage, imageView    idinitWithImageURLNSStringimageTTURL       if self  [super init]           hiResImage  nil          NSString documentsDirectory  [NSString stringWithString[NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomainsNSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES lastObject]]         [self setImageURL[NSString stringWithFormat.jpg, documentsDirectory, imageTTURL]]          return self    voidloadView       [super loadView]       Initialize the scroll view        hiResImage  [UIImage imageWithContentsOfFileself.imageURL]     CGSize photoSize  [hiResImage size]     mainScrollView  [[AppScrollView alloc] initWithFrame[UIScreen mainScreen].bounds]     mainScrollView.autoresizingMask   UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth  UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight     mainScrollView.backgroundColor  [UIColor blackColor]     mainScrollView.contentSize  photoSize     mainScrollView.contentMode  UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFit     mainScrollView.delegate  self       Create the image view and add it to the scrollview.

Negative 5614 pOur application displays a 2D view of our data mainly maps and then allows the user to change to a 3D view.

Negative 5614 pI like the way Guice makes it fairly straight forward to manually create your own modules each with their own bindings done in code. CDI on the other hand seems to rely more on magic rather than programmatic access to sest bindings. Am i wrong or how can one achieve the same effect with WELD.p  pAny code sample would be appreciated...p  h1CLARIFICATIONh1  pI was hoping to build a ModuleGuice term sorry im unsure of the CDI term programmatically, using the builder pattern style as given by Guice on a hrefhttpcode.google.compgoogleguicehttpcode.google.compgoogleguicea.p  pI am building a dynamic system and there is a need for me to be able to bind typeslike interfaces, constants etc rather than just have Weld dynamicaly scan the classpath etc and find and register types. I believe that CDI is static the javax.inject package does not include any interfaces that allow one to programmatically bind types to implementations.p  h1CLARIFICATION  PART 2h1  pThe basic premise of the original question was the simple observation that annotations are baked in and the rules defined in them to help the inejctor cannot be changed. I originally wanted public access to the same interfaces that the CDI classpath scanner uses to build definitions for its internal use. Basically waht im saying is, i want a layer that allows me to read the annotations and create the definitions for the container. A default provider could be one that does what happens now, but if you want some other strategy then there exists the possibility to do this.p  pOne problem with the current approach is the limitation that one cannot reuse componentsclasses with different annotations to select different collaborators. Before you jump let me qualify this statement, yes it can be done with providers and the such but this leads to more artifacts. There should be a simpler way. p  h1Example1h1  pSorry if this example is poor, my use case is much more involved and the detail would get in the way and make for a much longer read.p  pImagine one has a url rewriting component that for arguments sake has some parameters likep  ul lireplace this pattern with that pattern.li limaybe a html cleanerli ul  pIf you wish to inject this same component with two different replace rules but have the html cleaner injector, your stuck. Sure there are ways to get around this but they require artefacts which is of course more code.p  pAll binding rules unfortunately are on the class and not the instance thus every time you ask for a class you get back pretty much afunctionally equivalent instance.p  h1WELDh1  pThis question was written a whiel ago, i have given up on Weld.I believe the way it dictates how its magic is done is wrong. I dont like the fact they dictate to me how this happens without providing me a way to control when or how i might want to repeat this action. I dont like this inflexibility.p

So far, one snag Ive hit is that this control cannot be put in the master page, but would have to be included in each view, before the form ends. I dont mind that so much. Clicking either the Previous or Next button submit the containing form to the appropriate action however, Im unsure on how to do the followingp  p1 Detect whether the Previous or Next button was clicked 2 ShowHide logic of Previous amp Next buttons at the beginning amp end of the process respectively.p  pAnother oddity Im noticing with my application in general is that, after going through several pages of the process, if I click the back button, some values from my model populate on the page and others do not. For example, the text entered for a text area shows, but the value that had been chosen for a radio button is not selected, yet when inspecting the model directly, the appropriate object does have a value to be bound to the radio button.p  pI may just need to put that last part in a new question. My main question here is with the navigation control. Any pointers or tips on handling that logic amp detecting whether Next or Previous was clicked would be most helpful.p  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pI had a thought to put a hidden field in the control that displays the Previous amp Next buttons. Depending on what button was clicked, I would use JavaScript to update the hidden fields value. The problem now seems to be that the hidden field is never created nor submitted with the form. Ive amended the controller post arguments to accept the additional field, but it never gets submitted, nor is it in the FormCollection. p  pHere is the code for the hidden field. Note that its being generated in a user control that is called inside of the form on the parenting view hope that makes sense. p  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodelt Html.HiddennavDirection, navDirection gt codepre  pThoughtsp  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pI have resolved all of these issues. I will post the code in detail on Tuesday at the latest. The solution presented below will probably be selected as the answer as that got my on the right thought process. p  pIn short, the solution was to have a Navigation class like the one suggested with logic to determine the next or previous page based on the current view amp a string list of all views. A partial view  user control was created to display the Previous  Next buttons. The user control had 2 hidden fields 1 One with the value of the current view 2 a field indicating navigation direction previous or next. JavaScript was used to update the hidden navigation field value depending on what button was clicked. Logic in the user control determined whether or not to display the Previous or Next buttons depending on the first and last views in the wizard when compared to the current view.p  pAll said, Im pretty happy with the results. Ill probably find some code smell issues when I return to this, but, for now, it works.p  pThank you all for your helpp  pstrongEDIT 3  SOLUTIONstrongp  pHere is the code for the control I built to display the Next amp Previous navigation buttonsp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodelt Control LanguageC InheritsSystem.Web.Mvc.ViewUserControl gt lt Import NamespaceProject.Models gt ltlink href....Contentcustom.css relstylesheet typetextcss gt ltscript typetextjavascript gt     function setValval          var nav  document.getElementByIdNavigationDirection         nav.value  val      ltscriptgt  lt     String currentView  WebFormViewViewContext.View.ViewPath        String navDirection  empty    currentView  NavigationTracker.getShortViewNamecurrentView gt  ltinput typehidden valuelt currentView gt nameCurrentView idCurrentView gt ltinput typehidden valuelt navDirection gt nameNavigationDirection idNavigationDirection gt  lt if currentView  NavigationTracker.FirstPage   gt     ltdiv stylefloatleftgt                 ltinput typesubmit valuePrevious onclicksetValprevious gt      lt On click set navDirection  previous gt     ltdivgt lt  gt  lt if currentView  NavigationTracker.LastPage      gt ltdiv stylefloatrightgt     ltinput typesubmit valueNext onclicksetValnext  gt              lt On click set navDirection  next gt ltdivgt     lt  gt codepre  pFrom there, you render the control just before the closing tag of a form on views you want it like sop  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodelt Html.RenderPartialBottomNavControl gt     lt  gt codepre  pNow I cant really post all of the NavigationTracker code, but the meat of how it works can be deduced from the selected answer and the following snippet that returns the name of the view, based on the current view and the direction previous or next.p  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic String NextView      get              if String.IsNullOrEmptythis.NavigationDirection return string.Empty         int index  this.MyViews.IndexOfthis.CurrentView         String result  string.Empty         if this.NavigationDirection.Equalsnext ampamp index  1 lt MyViews.Count                       result  this.MyViews[index  1]                  else if this.NavigationDirection.Equalsprevious ampamp index gt 0                      result  this.MyViews[index  1]                  return result       codepre  pNow, doing all of this has a few side effects that could easily be considered code smell. Firstly, I have to amend all of my controller methods that are marked [HTTPPOST] to accept a NavigationTracker object as a parameter. This object contains helper methods and the CurrentView amp NavigationDirection properties. Once this is done, I can get the next view the same way in all of my actionsp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodereturn RedirectToActionnav.NextView codepre  pwhere nav is of type NavigationTracker.p  pAnother note is that the FirstPage amp LastPage properties of NavigationTracker are static so Im actually using NavigationTracker.FirstPage in my global.asax.cs file for my routing. This means I can go to my NavigationTracker class and change the flow in one place for the entire application.p  pI would love any comments or criticisms on this solution. I admit this might not be a terrific solution, but at first glance, Im pretty happy with it. p  pHope it helps.p

I had almost no restrictions for this website because none of the data is private or personal.br br  However I have received new requirements.br p  pHere are the new password requirementsp  ul liPasswords must be at least 8 characters in length.li liPasswords must be created using 3 of the following 4 character types    ul     liUppercaseli     liLowercaseli     liNumericli     liPunctuationli    ulli liDo not use your name or User ID in the password.li liDo not use old passwords again later.li liPasswords must be changed at least every 60 days.li liPasswords may not contain your User ID or any part of your full name.li liPassword history retention will prohibit use of the last 24 passwords.li liPasswords may be changed by users only once in any 6day period.li ul  pbr  I realize I am going to have to modify all of the following pages Register, Login, Forgot Password, etc... fortunately I stopped using the default controls a long time ago. br br  I appreciate your thoughts.brp  pMy first thought was that I need to write a Custom Membership Provider.

Negative 5614 pI have a task assigned to me but I am not a project manager. Doh. So here is the problem. Imagine that you have 100 tasks which should be done in 1 year. So we want to do 5 or six releases during this year. Our team is small, about 10 people. Now we go trough all the tasks and mark 15 of them for example to be released in 2 months. But 1 developer is ready with his tasks 1 month ahead and he has no tasks until we release.p  pWe use SVN and currently we work in the trunk. How you suppose to organize our SVN repository We want the developer who finished his tasks to start working on tasks for the next release. If we create a branch for each release and work there trunk is only a result of merging with branches is something like suicide.p  pCan you give me suggestions. Thanksp

Negative 5614 pI working through the RubyonRails Tutorial book and Ive got a perplexing problem that I cant figure out.  I got rspec up and running with spork and it seems like a great system.  However on the first test Ive ran into something that is just crazy.

So I create the red spec for the about pagep  precode  describe GET about do     it should be successful do       get about       response.should besuccess     end   end codepre  pThis fails as expected.  Then I add a route to the to the routes.rb file p  precodeget pagesabout codepre  pA controller to the pagescontroller.rb file that adds a controller.p  precodedef about end codepre  pI add a very simple static web page for the about page.p  pThe book says that after doing this test should be green, or pass the tests.  It doesnt.  The really perplexing thing is that I can actually open the simple web page by typing in the address.p  precodehttplocalhost3000pagesabout codepre  pIve tried changing the about to home so that I essentially run the home test twice.  That works OK so I know that there isnt a syntax problem.  Ive changed everything around so that I see that the test fails at different points.p  pI finally, our of desperation thought that Id try asking a question.  It seems very basic, but since Im reading this book to learn the system, I really dont know where to start looking.  Or Ive tried everything my limited knowledge allows me to.p

Negative 5614 pI have a very specific problem concerning Dns.GetHostEntryp  pA service uses Dns.GetHostEntry to retrieve all IP Adresses of a host, using the name of of the host.

The service has worked for quite some time, but recently is stopped working, throwing the no such host is known error sadly, no stack trace is available. Nslookup works though, no problems there.

[EDIT] Even deliberatly addind a wrong PTR record does not make the problem occur on my test machine.p  p[EDIT2] The only thing that made the error come up was disconnecting the network adapter, and thereby making the DNS Server unavailable, even though the forward resolving still worked due to caching.p  pSo, my questions are p  ol liUnder which conditions does GetHostEntry throw this specific error li liWhich resolution methods does it use If Im not mistaken it uses the unmanaged WinSock function getnameinfo a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms73853228vvs.8529.aspxhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms738532vvs.85.aspxa, Name resolution can be by the Domain Name System DNS, a local hosts file, strongor by other naming mechanisms.strongli liAny ideas why this suddenly fails for machines on the other domain but not for machines on the same domainli ol  pThanks and best regards, cun83p

Negative 5614 pI have evidently inadvertently created a beast that I would appreciate ideas on where to look for alternatives or how I might identify the problem. This is a C .Net 3.0 app.p  pI have a master page that contains 4 textboxes.  When the user enters text in one of the text boxes it triggers a javascript call to refresh the search results page that is inside an IFrame on the master page.p  pWhen the search results page loads a call is made to a property ltresults  which calls the search function.  The search function retrieves an XML string from the SQL Server database, loads it into an XmlDocument, and transforms the output with XLST into a stringWriter back to the property results.p  pThe XSLT output is a table with about 24 columns, javascript on the row click for highlighting a row, and some links on each row for going to a new screen to edit the selected record. p  pIt works in a timely fashion up to 100 rows.  When it reaches 200 table rows the lag time becomes noticable.  At 500 rows it takes about 12  15 seconds to render, and then at 1000 rows it takes 90 seconds.  There are 3000 records possible and the user would like to be able to have an option to return all rows for sorting, analyzing, and possibly exporting so, I need a better mouse trap.p  pThe delay is entirely in the browser rendering with Internet Explorer 8.0.  With Google Chrome it takes approximately 7 seconds for 1000 rows.  Also, I have used additional test code to write the html output from the xslt transform to a file to ensure the output is well formed and there are no problems noted.  I have navigated to the saved file on my local machine and with the 1000 rows in a fresh browser window and it takes approximately 5 seconds to load into the browser so, I am really at a loss as to why it takes 90 seconds to load directly into the web form in the IFrame.p  pDoes anyone have a clue what might be happening and how to resolve the problems  Is there a better way to crack this nut  Would it be any better if I saved the XSLT output to a file and loaded that into the IFrame  Or maybe I should scrap the xslt and just use a response.Write loopp

Negative 5614 pHave a WCF Service being called to update records in the database.  If the connection is broken, the service will continue to process the data, but the client wont know of the results.  I.E. the processing could have succeeded or failed the client doesnt know if it should resend the data.p  pTypical example would be a bank deposit.  An ATM takes a deposit and makes a WCF call to update the customers account.  The connection is dropped, leaving the ATM uncertain as to whether the deposit was processed or not.  If it wasnt, and the ATM doesnt resend, the customer doesnt have the money in his account.  If the ATM resends, but the deposit was processed, hell have two deposits.p  pEnabling transactions on the WCF Service call seems the thing to do, but can they handle a dropped connection  I.E. the client can roll back the transaction if it loses connection to the server, but how would the server know about the rollback if the client isnt connectedp

The only thing I can think of is that the main thread is bogged up with the usual routines of the UIKit, meaning my setNeedsDisplay gets called long behind when it is supposed to about 12 sec later. I think this because in other code, based off of user interaction, I call setNeedsDisplay right away, and it works fine without any lag at all.

Negative 5614 pI need to use codeDictionaryltlong, stringgtcode collections that given two instances coded1code and coded2code where they each have the same codeKeyValuePairltlong, stringgtcode contents, which could be inserted in any orderp  ol licoded1  d2code evaluates to codetruecodeli licoded1.GetHashCodecode  coded2.GetHashCodecodeli ol  pThe first requirement was achieved most easily by using a codeSortedDictionarycode instead of a regular codeDictionarycode.p  pThe second requirement is necessary because I have one point where I need to store codeDictionaryltDictionaryltlong, stringgt, Listltstringgtcode  the main codeDictionarycode type is used as the key for another codeDictionarycode, and if the HashCodes dont evaluate based on identical contents, the using codeContainsKeycode will not work the way that I want ie if there is already an item inserted into the dictionary with coded1code as its key, then codedictionary.ContainsKeyd2code should evaluate to codetruecode.p  pTo achieve this, I have created a new object codeclass ComparableDictionary  SortedDictionaryltlong, stringgtcode, and have included the followingp  precodepublic override int GetHashCode                 StringBuilder str  new StringBuilder    foreach var item in this        str.Appenditem.Key       str.Append       str.Appenditem.Value       str.Append        return str.ToString.GetHashCode   codepre  pIn my unit testing, this meets the criteria for both equality and hashcodes. However, in reading a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combericlippertarchive20110228guidelinesandrulesforgethashcode.aspx relnofollowGuidelines and Rules for GetHashCodea, I came across the followingp  blockquote   pRule the integer returned by GetHashCode must never change while the object is contained in a data structure that depends on the hash code remaining stablep      pIt is permissible, though dangerous, to make an object whose hash code value can mutate as the fields of the object mutate. If you have such an object and you put it in a hash table then the code which mutates the object and the code which maintains the hash table are required to have some agreedupon protocol that ensures that the object is not mutated while it is in the hash table. What that protocol looks like is up to you.p      pIf an objects hash code can mutate while it is in the hash table then clearly the Contains method stops working. You put the object in bucket 5, you mutate it, and when you ask the set whether it contains the mutated object, it looks in bucket 74 and doesnt find it.p      pRemember, objects can be put into hash tables in ways that you didnt expect. A lot of the LINQ sequence operators use hash tables internally. Dont go dangerously mutating objects while enumerating a LINQ query that returns themp blockquote  pNow, the codeDictionaryltComparableDictionary, ListltStringgtgtcode is used only once in code, in a place where the contents of all codeComparableDictionarycode collections should be set. Thus, according to these guidelines, I emthinkem that it would be acceptable to override codeGetHashCodecode as I have done basing it completely on the contents of the dictionary. p  pAfter that introduction strongmy questionsstrong are p  ol liI know that the performance of codeSortedDictionarycode is very poor compared to codeDictionarycode and I can have hundreds of object instantiations. The only reason for using codeSortedDictionarycode is so that I can have the equality comparison work based on the contents of the dictionary, regardless of order of insertion. Is there a better way to achieve this equality requirement without having to use a codeSortedDictionarycodeli liIs my implementation of codeGetHashCodecode acceptable based on the requirements Even though it is based on mutable contents, I dont think that that should pose any risk, since the only place where it is using I think is after the contents have been set.li ol  pemNoteem while I have been setting these up using codeDictionarycode or codeSortedDictionarycode, I am not wedded to these collection types. The main need is a collection that can store pairs of values, and meet the equality and hashing requirements defined out above.p

Negative 5614 pi have an action that executes a possible long running task. A possible, because it does a request to a remote server, and because of network latency, it can block the user interface and give a small delay to the user.p  pMy question is not related with how to send long tasks in background, but how to push a notification to the user. My idea, was that the user clicks the button, it fires a task in background, the web interface is unblocked, and the user can do whatever he wants and, when the task is done, he receives a flash message. I can do it with AJAX, polling the server, a specific action that gives me the status of my task, for example, but there is any pattern to do it event based Kudos for answers with proof of concept or prototypes. p

Negative 5614 pI have the pleasure of using SyncFx v.2.1 on an application. The client side presently uses SQLCE and the Server side uses Server 2008 r2. I am using a SyncFx proxy and host the server SyncAdapterBuilder code in the WCF service. The client has the SyncAgent and SyncTables and it works fine. I am using the integrated SQL Change Tracking in lieu of the coupled aka custom  scoped change tracking because I am not permitted to modify existing schema.p  pSo my issue is that the requirements for the system have changed and I am required to use SQL Express on the client in order to support stored procedures.p  pWhy not merge replication The requirements also prohibit modification of the schema or the use of triggers. In fact the original version of the app used merge replication with SQLCE before moving to SyncFx for SQLCE.p  pSo how is this done Ive read a lot of conflicting information and I can only assume that this is in response to the ever evolving versions of SyncFx. There are no direct example of how SQL to SQL Express with Change Tracking on both is accomplished. Plus I am trying to transition from a functional SQLCE implementation to Express with as few changes as possible. The client is already capable of using either type of DB, it is just the current sync process that needs to change.p  pHere is what Ive found, but have not had success. Ive read every StackOverflow response on the matter and am still not finding a way to do this that actually works.p  ol lia hrefhttpcode.msdn.microsoft.comDatabaseSyncSQLServere97d1208 relnofollowDatabase SyncSQL Server and SQL Express NTier with WCFa  This MS example works fine with the SyncOrchistrator but provisions side tracking tables and triggers. I was not able to modify this in such a way that change tracking could be used on the client and server.li lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5135205syncframeworkwithsqlserver2008changetrackingSync framework with SQL Server 2008 Change Trackinga  StephaneT suggests here that simply by using the normal SQLCE approach with the SQL Express sample sync provider and SyncFx 2.0 techniques only client side table modification would be required. Unfortunately all links to this sample SQL Express provider seem to be removed and other posts from JuneT and even Liam Cavanagh on MSDN suggest moving forward with the new official SqlServerProvider instead of a customized version of the DbServerProvider. Problem is there are no sample implementations of this anywhere and I havent been able to figure it out through trial and error.li lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1656652syncingsqlserver2008databasesoverhttpusingwcfsyncframeworkSyncing SQL Server 2008 Databases over HTTP using WCF amp Sync Frameworka  Raj gives the best example simple and easily translated to SQLCE processes unfortunately it also uses the SqlExpressClientSyncProvider that seems to have evaporated from the internet. It also requires an anchor table to track the clients, I think I can get away with that as I am not allowed to modify schema on existing tables.li ol  pSo any examples out there that can help me. Essentially I want to port the existing functioning SQLCE SyncFx via proxy with integrated SQL Change Tracking using a SyncAgent to a version that works for SQL Express without changing existing scheama or using triggers. I should also mention that I use filter parameters heavily as there are 150 tables in the replication and they would be extremely large without filters. I had read some references that said the SqlExpressClientSyncProvider didnt support filters, but this is impossible for me to verify since I cant find a reference to that code that is still good.p  pMaybe there is a refresh of Rajs example that uses SqlServerSyncProviderp  pThanks in advance to anyone that can point me in the right directionp

Negative 5614 pIm working on an Android app that consumes a web service that has the potential to return quite a lot of data.

Would JSON be a good alternative We might need to fetch quite a lot of data in some use cases.p  pWed really rather not use SOAP, if can avoid it.

Anyway, to answer your questions, by a lot of data, I mean that there are going to be ba few large requests23, depending on the use case that MIGHT return a lot of data, e.g. if I search using the entity namecomplete or partial, the result, which is going to be textual data only, would be considerably less than if the serach was made with country as a search parameter, in which case it might return several hundred separate results. One particular search parameter has the potential to return a few thousand rows of data. What we can control is the amount of data in each rowso to speak returned. Currently, were attempting to reduce the items to display per rowwere attempting to keep it below 5. Its a business decision, Im afraid, so if were stuck with the current scenario of 12 items per row, we need to be prepared for that as well, Im afraid.p

This field will get the current time, when the payment is confirmed from paypal. I have already handled if they cancel the payment by pushing the cancel button on paypal. But if there are some errors while trying to set up the payment, or the user closes the window, or the payment times out, the rows will still be in the database. What I want to do is have them deleted after maybe 20 min, if they havent been given a valid value in the datetimefield.p  pEDIT I also have a field for when the row is inserted when the payment is called.p  pWhats the best way to do thisp

Negative 5614 pI cant make sense of the BMP format, I know its supposed to be simple, but somehow Im missing something. I thought it was 2 headers followed by the actual bytes defining the image, but the numbers do not add up.p  pFor instance, Im simply trying to load this BMP file into memory 640x480 8bpp grayscale and just write it back to a different file. From what I understand, there are two different headers BITMAPFILEHEADER and BITMAPINFOHEADER. The BITMAPFILEHEADER is 14 bytes, and the BITMAPINFOHEADER is 40 bytes this one depends on the BMP, how can I tell thats another story. Anyhow, the BITMAPFILEHEADER, through its parameter bfOffBits says that the bitmap bits start at offset 1078. This means that there are 1024  1078  4014  other bytes, carrying more information. What are those bytes, and how do I read them, this is the problem. Or is there a more correct way to load a BMP and write it to disk p  pFor reference here is the code I used  Im doing all of this under windows btw.p  precodeinclude ltwindows.hgt include ltiostreamgt include ltstdio.hgt   HANDLE hfile DWORD written  BITMAPFILEHEADER bfh BITMAPINFOHEADER bih  int main     hfile  CreateFileimage.bmp,GENERICREAD,FILESHAREREAD,NULL,OPENEXISTING,FILEATTRIBUTENORMAL,NULL ReadFilehfile,ampbfh,sizeofbfh,ampwritten,NULL  ReadFilehfile,ampbih,sizeofbih,ampwritten,NULL  int imagesize  bih.biWidth  bih.biHeight  image  unsigned char mallocimagesize  ReadFilehfile,image,imagesizesizeofchar,ampwritten,NULL  CloseHandlehfile codepre  pIm then doing the exact opposite to write to a file,p  precodehfile  CreateFileimageout.bmp,GENERICWRITE,FILESHAREWRITE,NULL,CREATEALWAYS,FILEATTRIBUTENORMAL,NULL  WriteFilehfile,ampbfh,sizeofbfh,ampwritten,NULL WriteFilehfile,ampbih,sizeofbih,ampwritten,NULL WriteFilehfile,image,imagesizesizeofchar,ampwritten,NULL  CloseHandlehfile codepre  pemstrongEdit  Solvedemstrongp  pOk so I finally got it right, it wasnt really complicated after all.

I would like to make a 3D plot or surface where the third dimension is this threshold t from 0100 intervals of 5 and the other two dimensions are intensity and frequency respectively as for the 2D histogram. How can I do that Ive looked at most of the plotting tools such as surf, isosurface, slices and so on. None of them seem to do the trick. My matrix is 80x100x20 where the 20 dimension is that of the threshold. Any ideas THANKSp

Negative 5614 pI am trying to use lablTk to build a GUI in an OCaml application under Linux.

How can I select a directory from a standard dialog Tk 8.4 supports this functionality, and I expected that OCaml can use it.p  pActually, there is very little documentation directly on the Tk module of lablTk. I see from a hrefhttpdocs.camlcity.orgdocsgodipkg3.11godiocamllabltklibocamlstdliblabltktk.cmipretty relnofollowthis documentationa that there are functions such as codegetOpenFilecode and codegetSaveFilecode in the Tk module, but not codechooseDirectorycode.p  ol liHow can I see the functions exported by lablTk in the Tk module There is no tk.mli file in usrlibocamllabltk. Does it mean that the C side of the Tk module directly binds to functions such as codegetOpenFilecode, without going through an OCaml moduleli liIf the Tk module can bind these functions directly, maybe I can do a little work and directly call a Tk function not included in lablTk, such as codechooseDirectorycode Is it possible to call this function by declaring it as external in some way how, or do I need to do more work I would consider writing a little wrapper in C so that I can call more Tk functions in addition to the functions available in lablTk, if this were possible and not very time consuming or do I have to modify the sources of lablTk, recompile and install a custom version of lablTk, just so that I can use a few more Tk functions If so, how do I recompile lablTk with these changes, and what should I keep in mind Where can I see the documentationli ol

Negative 5614 pI have a server serving multiple websites under one IP with bindings on specific URLs.p  pHowever, one of the sites I am hosting needs to pull data off a webservice .asmx file located in another IIS website on the same server. The code works fine locally but when we push the code to our server, it seems not to be able to locally resolve the lookup. getting the dreaded No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it. I think whats happening is it tries to use the endpoint address and do a DNS lookup, but because the DNS lookup ends up resolving to the same IP, it actually pulls the traffic via inmemory or pipes or something and not network, which causes IIS not to bind to the correct site, and so the whole thing goes to pot. p  pIs there a way I can use the windows hosts file or other mechanism to fix this apparent DNS issue Perhaps someone might shed light on this and maybe its not DNS at all. Thanksp  pUPDATE  Here is a quick breakdown of the domains in question. Nothing is specifically coded or pointing to localhost. Everyhing is using fully qualified domain names.p  pDomainA.com is a website that, when a form is submitted, calls a web service from DomainB.com. Both DomainA.com and DomainB.com are web sites set up in IIS on the same server bound to the same external IP address. What I embelieveem to be the problem is that DomainA.com, when the form is submitted, does a DNS lookup for DomainB.com, and when it finds that the domain is the same IP address, does not use the domain name when making the requests to DomainB.com. Without the domain name being usedsent, IIS doesnt know which site to connect to and the target machine actively refuses the connection.p

Negative 5614 pIn my application, I have a scenario where if a change occurs on a particular module, it has to be notified to few other modules. I thought an observer pattern would fit here, by keeping the  module on which the change will occur as subject and the modules to be notified as observers.p  pBut going by the principle of observer pattern, the observers are independent of each other. There should be no connection between the observers. In my case, though the modules are different, they are dependent. The successful completion of execution of the first module is important for the next module to execute. Also if the module x fails, all changes made by module 1 to module x1 has to be reverted. That is, either all the  modules has to successfully execute or we have to rollback to previous state. You can imagine it like a transaction. Then I realized I was wrong that observer pattern is not the right way to implement this.p  pI am kind of stuck up here to come up with a clean design, where there are set of modules who needs to handled when a change in subject happens, but with the constraint the modules are dependent on each other. Can someone help me with this problem to come up with a good designp

Negative 5614 pI have just started to use the unit testing features in Xcode 4.4.1 with the LLVM Compiler. I have created some basic unit tests. I have attempted to turn on code coverage by turning on the Instrument Program Flow and Generate Test Coverage Files in the Product section. Also, I have looked through and cant see anything written in the prefix header section. From what I have read in XCode 4.4.1 this is all you have to do to get it to work and it should generate .gcno and .gcda files in the objectsnormali386 folder which can be opened with CoverStory to view the code coverage. After I quit my app the .gcno files are getting updated but I am not getting any .gcda files.

Negative 5614 pCan we rely on the fact that in ObjectiveC, the rule is that a classs designated initializer is always called for sure  Or can we say, it should be almost always true, except a couple of exceptions For example, for codeUIViewcode, the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationUIKitReferenceUIViewClassUIViewUIView.htmlapplerefdoccrefUIViewdocsa saysp  blockquote   pinitWithFramep      pIf you create a view object programmatically, this method is the   designated initializer for the UIView class. Subclasses can override   this method to perform any custom initialization but must call super   at the beginning of their implementation. p      pIf you use Interface Builder   to design your interface, this method is not called when your view   objects are subsequently loaded from the nib file. Objects in a nib   file are reconstituted and then initialized using their initWithCoder   methodp blockquote  pOr can we say that, if it is programmatically, the rule should always apply for well designed classes, but Interface Builder is a bit different because it sort of revive or build the object from a nonprogrammatic way.

Negative 5614 pIve got this working, but its very slow to the point of timing out for even a dozen or so files. p  pIt grabs a dir listing from dropbox, and compares that to the contents of a table. Id like to optimize this so that it would run as fast and efficiently as possible.

I am looking into putting a time on the operation to see where the delay is coming from. for a folder with 10 files, it takes well over a minute to load the page.

Negative 5614 pSuppose a project is to use an old frozen version of Component1 say revision Rev1 but the current master version of all other files. Component1 is a directory in the same repository. p  pGITs whole fileset view seems to be awkward in this case. In CVS, one could simply put a sticky tag on Component1 to freeze those files at Rev1, or even branch there, while all other files would stay on the master branch.p  pThe repository is used for other projects that want the latest Component1 so we cant simply roll back the updates to Component1.p  pOne possibility is to create a branch at Rev1, but then one must constantly be merging in updates to all other files from master. Moreover, I have to be very careful on those merges to not accidentally merge any updates to Component1, which is easy to do in GIT because commits are by default automatic after a merge. p  pMapping Component1 in as a submodule would provide more control but in this case all files are sharing a common repository. p  pgit checkout ltrevgt  Component1 lets me pick a specific version of a component, but I cant commit that to master, or merge a branch into master that does such a revision selection, or else it will be exposed to all other projects.p  pAny other suggestions would be appreciated.p

Negative 5614 pIm looking for the best way to quickly and repeatedly blit RGB bitmap data to a specific area within a Mac OS X window, for the purpose of displaying video frames coming from a custom video engine in real time.

Negative 5614 pThe app I am working on needs wifi to be constantly on as I sendsreceives audio using wifi network. It then plays out the audio. The needs to do this continuously until the user chooses to stop it.p  pstrongThe problemstrong  iOS turns off WiFi after 30 mins, hence the sockets close and the AudioQueues stop. Here is an excerpt from Apples documentationp  blockquote   pTo prevent the WiFi hardware from using too much power, iOS has a   builtin timer that turns off the hardware completely after 30 minutes   if no running app has requested its use through the   UIRequiresPersistentWiFi key. If the user launches an app that   includes the key, iOS effectively disables the timer for the duration   of the apps life cycle. As soon as that app quits or is suspended,   however, the system reenables the timer. p      pstrongNotestrong Note that even when   UIRequiresPersistentWiFi has a value of true, it has no effect when   the device is idle that is, screenlocked. The app is considered   inactive, and although it may function on some levels, it has no WiFi   connection.p blockquote  pstrongThings that are already implementedstrongp  ol lipThe audiosession is activated on the device. It is kept that way until the user chooses to stop the audio or until the connection is lost and the AudioQueues are stopped too.pli lipUIRequiresPersistentWiFi is set to true in the .plist filepli lipReachability APIs are implemented to detect any connection loss and do the needful.pli lipApplication does not run in background is set to false in the .plist filepli lipRequired background modes has the item App plays audio in the array in the .plist file.pli lipNSStreamNetworkServiceTypeVoiceforKey is set on the property NSStreamNetworkServiceType for the sockets on both the devices.pli lipThe kCFStreamPropertyNoCellular property set on the sockets to a value of kCFBooleanTrue does not helppli lipThe only setting that helps is setting the NSStreamNetworkServiceType to NSStreamNetworkServiceTypeVoIP and adding the App provides Voice over IP services for the Required Background modes field in the .plist file. However Apple will reject the app for not implementing any VoIP services in the app.pli ol  pI have been talking to Apple DTS about this issue, according to them there is no API level support to help with this problem. I however have my doubts about this claim, there are several appsFor example Pandora on the app store that will need this feature.p

Negative 5614 pI have a nested dictionary containing a bunch of data on a number of different objects where I mean object in the nonprogramming sense of the word. The format of the dictionary is allData[i][someDataType], where i is a number designation of the object that I have data on, and someDataType is a specific data array associated with the object in question.p  pNow, I have a function that I have defined that requires a particular data array for a calculation to be performed for each object. The data array is called codecleanFDFcode. So I feed this to my function, along with a bunch of other things it requires to work. I call it like thisp  precoderm.analyze4complexityallData[i][cleanFDF], other data, other data, other data codepre  pInside the function itself, I straight away reassign the codecleanFDFcode data to another variable name, namely codeclFDFcode. I.e. The end result isp  precodeclFDF  allData[i][cleanFDF] codepre  pI then have to zero out all of the data that lies below a certain threshold, as suchp  precodeclFDF[ clFDF lt threshold ]  0 codepre  pOK  the function works as it is supposed to. But now when I try to plot the original cleanFDF data back in the main script, the entries that got zeroed out in clFDF are also zeroed out in codeallData[i][cleanFDF]code. WTF Obviously something is happening here that I do not understand.p  pTo make matters even weirder from my point of view, Ive tried to do a bodgy kludge to get around this by saving the array to another variable before calling the function. I.e. I dop  precodesaveFDF  allData[i][cleanFDF] codepre  pthen run the function, then update the codecleanFDFcode entry with the saved data p  precodeallData[i].update cleanFDFsaveFDF  codepre  pbut somehow, simply by performing clFDF[ clFDF lt threshold ]  0 within the function modifies codeclFDFcode, codesaveFDFcode and codeallData[i][cleanFDF]code in the main friggin script, zeroing out all the entires at the same array indexes It is like they are all associated global variables somehow, but Ive made no such declarations anywhere...p  pI am a hopeless Python newbie, so no doubt Im not understanding something about how it works. Any help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 5614 pI have a list of items from Question model on each users profile page viewsusersshow.html.erb in a Rails app. The list of items is kind of information that youd expect to find in  in viewsquestionsindex.html.erb. Ive arranged it so that when a user clicks on the show link, it displays the content in the same page viewsusersshow.html. If the user clicks on another show link, it just replaces the content that was displayed with the id of the question that was clicked with the next link.  However, after the user clicks on show, theres no way to unclose the data, unless the user refreshes the home page etc therefore, once a user clicks on a show link lets say theres a list of 10 links, I want to be able to display a link beside the entry that was clicked as opposed to the 9 in the list that werent that allows the user to hide the data. I know how to hide the data i.e. it would just be a link back to the same page, however, I dont know how to make the link appear beside the entry that was clicked. Ive given each link a unique class id using the id of the question, so i can differentiate between the links, but Im stuck on where to go from here.

Negative 5614 pThe app that Im working on is automatically showing the splash screen only when it goes into background to make a call.p  pThe other functions of going out of the app and becoming active again does not activate the splash screen. For example, going out of the app into an external website, phone map or another application and coming back into the app will show user the previous state and does not show the splash screen.p  pIs this something that can be controlled by the app side or is this an iOS feature that apple automatically handles when a phone call is madep  pI have managed the leaks on the app side and all is good now so it cant be anything to do with memory management on the app side. Is there anything else that can be done indirectly so that the splash screen will not showp

Negative 5614 pI have a asp.net web application, which runs on Mono framework and Apache.p  pI have a page which has flash. From that page, i will make a ajax request to the server and the return value will be processed by the flash. Say for example, Im calling GetXML function from the server. Everything works fine.p  pBut when i tried to access the same flash page from two different browsers say IE and Chrome, only one browser is getting the ajax response. The other browser request is hanging for ever. When we see the apache logs, the request is sent to the server but it is still in the state of sending reply. After certain time, the request is timedout.p  pPlease note this behavior is not happening always, but it can be reproduced somehow. Also it is happening in any browser regardless of IE or Chrome. p  pI have searched in net, but in one place it is suggesting to disable the session state, which i cannot use as im having user logging mechanism and used session in most of the places. p  pCan anybody help on this thanks in advance.p

Negative 5614 pIm at least trying to implement codeRepository patterncode in my .NET C project so when I need to communicate with the database I us something like thisp  precodeIListltSolegt soles  SoleService.All.ToList codepre  pAs the name of the method called from the service suggest with the query above I get all records form codeSolecode table. I dont want and I think this is the right way to implement this pattern, to keep too much custom logic in my service. What I mean is that I only want to keep the codeAllcode method and each modification of the result to be made outside the service methods.p  pThe current problem is this. I have entity codeSolecode and entity codeSoleColorcode. codeSoleColorcode has a foreign key column codeSoleIDcode making the relation between the two tables. Right now for those two entities I can call only codeAllcode method p  precodevar soleColors  SoleColorService.All var soles  SoleService.All codepre  pBut here I need some customization in the form of selecting only those rows from codeSolecode that are related with the codeSoleColorcode entity. In other words only end up with a list of only those rows from codeSolecode where Sole.ID can be found as a foreign key in codeSoleColorcode SoleID foreign key.p  pRight now Im a bit confused  its been a while since I last used plain SQL synthax. I think this is easily achieved using SQL and JOIN. But when LINQ is involved and my experience so far tells me that I need those two queries p  precodevar soleColors  SoleColorService.All var soles  SoleService.All codepre  pAnd then make some kind of JOINUNION to filter only the results I need.p  pSo which tools I need to use in this kind of situation cause its not the only place Im gonna need this and I want to learn to do it myself and of course to do it in this current situationp

Negative 5614 pIm porting a pile of C code to Javascript using the Emscripten system. The C code has many calls to codefopencode which is a synchronous IO call. Within Emscripten, we simulate this using an XHR request to a local resource emhoweverem, within Firefox synchronous XHR calls with a coderesponseTypecode of codeblobcode or codearraybuffercode are only supported within a WebWorker. Converting all that c code to adapt to asynchronous IO code seems very complicated so for my first try, Id like to see if I can fake a synchronous XHR request.p  pMy initial thought was that the main loop could share some state with a webworker which could make the synchronous io call and update the shared state while the main loop paused and waited for the webworker finished. DISCLAIMER I know this is not the typical Javascript way but I am porting synchronous code, not writing new code from scratch in which I would definitely have used asynchronous IO.p  pGiven the restrictions on sharing state between a webworker and the mainloop, this idea looks untenable.p  pAre there other ways to do thisp

I am reluctant to catch the generic codeExceptioncode when my function is already throwing 2 exceptionsp  pIt just occured to me, one way would be to sayp  precodetry      doSomethinga, b  catch AllExceptionsExceptionIOandEOF e      doSomethingWithErrore     if e instanceof IOException         throw e     if e instanceof EOFException         throw e  codepre  pIs there a more elegant way of doing this thoughp  pEDIT  The project is done in Java 6 compliance, unfortunately. I know Java 7 has made TryCatches a bit more flexible though. p

I also tried codeIEcaptcode thinking that it would somehow inherit the Java rendering capabilities of IE on the system, but it does not work.

Negative 5614 pI was wondering if theres any way to achieve something like this using EF4p  pI would like to do something like p  precode1.    Get Parent 2.    Dim Parent as oParent  mContext.GetParentparentId  3.   4.    Link a child without loading it entirely, only using his ID 5.    oParent.Children.AddOnlyUsingChildIdaChildId Or maybe EntityKey 6.  8.    Apply Changes Save 7.    mContext.SaveChanges codepre  pAll this because, I dont want to make a request to server each time to get whole child entity and anyway, I only have childs ID comes from a checkboxlist. This is part a loop, in a loop and may have to load a hundreds of children for each first level loop. In my point of view, it is possible to do that as Entity Graph should know that when it comes the time to save the parent and codeN..Ncode relation, he should only insert Parrent.nId and Child.nId in DB mapping table between child and parent... so it should not need entire childs graph.p  pAm I right Is it possiblep

Negative 5614 pWere doing an application which takes feeds and items in that feed to entities on our own site. This is supposed to be an open site which anybody can sign up to. All of this is done with MVC  knockoutjs. We are thinking about managing the entities from that site using Sharepoint 2013, essentially replacing our SQL tables of those entities, and putting them into lists on in our Sharepoint instance. Were also thinking of doing the same thing for users and passwords and such. Then we might have a setup for a single sign on for any other sites my company makes. Currently were using NHibernate and SQL server.p  pAre we are naive to think that Sharepoint could handle the amount of traffic, with outside users using our site, along with customers.

Negative 5614 pI have an application that will take care of recording video using UIImagePickerController object and videos are saved in the shared library of IOS. I have only one problem. If you record video from an external application to my application, unfortunately I can see both the videos recorded with my application is the video recorded by the other application. Is there a way to make the filter of assets not recorded with my application Thank you, Vincenzop

Negative 5614 pI am currently working on a project that involves mutual SSL between a client and a server. I was able to do this using P12 and JKS files but am now required to do the same thing using a smartcard token.p  pFirst I was quite confused that I could not obtain the private key from the card were talking unextractable keys here, but now I think I understand the basics of the whole process correct me if Im wrong, pleasep  pInstead of reading the private key directly, I let the smartcard handle the key via the provider we use OnePin OpenSC PKCS11 in Linux and SunMSCAPI in Windows. This way, the key is never actually extracted from the card. p  pAs the client were talking about is quite a complex thing, we decided to create a simpler test project that would first try to use the smartcards token for basic cryptographic operations like signing and ciphering.p  h2What I have successfully doneh2  pI managed to get signing to work in Linux with the following codep  precodeProvider sunMSC  Security.getProviderSunMSCAPI final String alias  Some Alias of a KeyEntry final byte[] msg  Hello World.getBytes KeyStore.CallbackHandlerProtection chp  new KeyStore.CallbackHandlerProtectionnew FixedPINCallbackHandler12345 KeyStore.Builder builder  KeyStore.Builder.newInstanceWindowsMY, sunMSC, chp KeyStore store  builder.getKeyStore PrivateKey pk  PrivateKeystore.getKeyalias, null Signature signature  Signature.getInstanceSHA1withRSA, sunMSC signature.initSignpk signature.updatemsg final byte[] sig  signature.sign codepre  pI can verify that signature using the corresponding certificate. The codeFixedPINCallbackHandlercode class is very simple and just sets the password of each codePasswordCallbackcode that it encounters in its codehandlecodeMethod with a given PIN 12345 in the examples case. I believe that the PIN does not really matter, as both Linux and Windows ask for the PIN using the readers drivers when the above code is executed I tried both the valid and an invalid PIN, giving me the same results. Windows will complain if you do not set any key in the callback handling code, though.p  h2What the actual problem ish2  pThe problem is that the above code that works totally fine in Linux wont work in WIndows. The moment it hits the last line in the snippet above when codesignature.signcode is called, it would throw the following exceptionp  precodeException in thread main java.security.SignatureException Ungltiger Schlssel at sun.security.mscapi.RSASignature.signHashNative Method at sun.security.mscapi.RSASignature.engineSignRSASignature.java390 at java.security.SignatureDelegate.engineSignUnknown Source at java.security.Signature.signUnknown Source at my code. codepre  pIm from Germany, the Ungltiger Schlssel from the above stack trace means invalid key.p  pThe class of the codePrivateKeycode is codesun.security.mscapi.RSAPrivateKeycode.p  pWhen I tried to establish a connection to the server earlier, I would always get something like thisp  precode CertificateVerify DAVWSMirror, WRITE TLSv1 Handshake, length  134 DAVWSMirror, WRITE TLSv1 Change Cipher Spec, length  1  Finished verifydata   122, 176, 195, 78, 166, 117, 103, 191, 102, 9, 101, 255   DAVWSMirror, WRITE TLSv1 Handshake, length  40 DAVWSMirror, received EOFException error DAVWSMirror, handling exception javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException Remote host closed connection during handshake DAVWSMirror, SEND TLSv1 ALERT  fatal, description  handshakefailure DAVWSMirror, WRITE TLSv1 Alert, length  24 DAVWSMirror, called closeSocket [DEBUG] [20131204 151140,809] [HTTPSender146]  [javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException Remote host closed connection during handshake] codepre  pDAVWSMirror is just the name of a thread, should anyone wonder.p  h2Private key detailsh2  pJust in case its important, heres what codepkcs15tool kcode tells me about the private key on the smartcardp  precodePrivate RSA Key [Private Key] Object Flags    [0x3], private, modifiable Usage           [0x4], sign Access Flags    [0x1D], sensitive, alwaysSensitive, neverExtract, local ModLength       2048 Key ref         1 0x1 Native          yes Path            3f005015 Auth ID         01 ID              45 codepre  h2What I triedh2  pI tried a second smartcard which is actually the type of card we need to support, which is different from the one I own, but got the same stacktrace.p  pI tried installing the unlimited strength policy files JCE, but the stacktrace stayed the same its possible that they were installed already.p  pDifferent versions of Java.

Also I have to make custom code for each piece, which is also bad because not all users have the same images to drag. p  pIs there a way to put all images draggable to the canvas, so I could easily add the image urls from my database as basic htmlcss Is it possible that the images would be outside of the canvas first Or should I create another canvas for the items users dont wantp

Negative 5614 pIm currently using Guice in my App. However i find myself mostly using assisted inject because there is a chain of injected objects that all depend on what was the input of the program.  Hence almost everything is assisted inject. p  pFor instance A need B who need c who need Z which needs input from the command line. In the end i feel like everything will be assisted injected. So given that im stuck with it i want to be sure that i m using it right. p  pI personally feel like writing my own factories would be as good. Moreover, in addition to the same advantage i could further limit the creation of my objects in question to these factories. p  pHence my question here is, how useful is it really to use assisted inject, is it only the idea of having things assisted and non assisted as the same time What if like in my case you have only have assisted parametersp  pTheir must be some gain at organizing it with assisted injection. I just dont see it. p  pIf anyone could enlighten me here, i would greatly i appreciate, p  pMany thanks p  pPS p  pMy dependency is as such p  pI have an strongInfrastructureServicestrong, which require a strongKnowledgeBaseServicestrong which in turn require an strongConFigDataObjectstrong. My configDataObject contains information coming from the inputs of the program. emThe configDataObject store these information after doing some validation and processing on those inputsem. For instance a string representing file path can be provided to it, and it will validate that it is file that exist, and have a getter method that return that File to its consumer. Other things might be URLNname to real URL Object, and so on. p  pThe important point here is this following graph  strongInfrastructureServicestrong  strongKnowledgeBaseServicestrong  strongConFigDataObjectstrong  strongInputDatastrongp  pTherefore the strongInfrastructureServicestrong can only work with a strongknowledgeBaseServicestrong that is started with the right inputFile, URL, workingfolder and etc.... which is provided to it with a configDataObject, that receive them from the input of the program and store a processed version of them.p  pTherefore as of now what i do is to have a assistedFactory to create the strongknowledgeBaseServicestrong. It takes as parameter the ConfigDataObject. The strongconfigDataObjectstrong is created with a emfactoryMethod Scala Companion Objectem. Finally, the an assistedFactory is also create for the strongInfrastructureServicestrong which takes as parameter for its emcreation methodem a strongKnowledgeBaseServicestrong. p  pAs you can guess everything is pretty much created upfront, and somehow manually. I find it odd. p

Negative 5614 pFor a few days Ive been trying to get a testprogram running to send data from a 64bit application to a 32bit application via Named Pipes. On my Windows 8.1 laptop 64bit the testprogram in the code below runs perfectly fine. When I try to run the exact same code on a Windows 7 64bit desktop computer, the server side gets the popup pwrite.exe has stopped working. This happens when I either compile it and run it on the desktop or when I run the executables compiled on the laptop on the desktop computer just by copying the two .exe files. p  pThe strange thing is that the client side receives the value send via the named pipe in the first WriteFile operation, but it will not get the value from the second operation in the forloop. So after the client side receives the correct value and displays it in the console window, the server side gets stuck. It could be that for some reason I dont have permission to write and the system realizes this after one operation, but I would expect an error related to permission, which is not the case. p  pTo give you a better ideap  ul lipBoth laptop and desktop computer accounts are running as Administrator.

Negative 5614 pI am a beginning trader who is just using iBrokers package of R for algorithm trading. p  pMy goal is to let R implement a strategy instantly when I get the right signalmarket price.p  pBut now I am stuck at the point that when I call function reqMktData to receive realtime data, I found R will not stop unless I manually stop it or I ask the function to return snapshot data.p  pEven though I may be able to write a while loop to get realtime data for the latter case, I found it very slow compared to what I want it to be each call of reqMktData will take a few seconds.p  pI was wondering if anyone could provide some hints to achieve my goal. Or can anyone provide a working example of a loop that collects real time data through the IBrokers package and allows trading logic to be executed I have spent a few days searching for solutions on internet and found nothing. Hope this is not a bad question. Thank youp

Negative 5614 pIm pretty new in Cassandra and I am trying to make a model for time series data. My current proposal is thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE myproject.variables  nearest10minutes timestamp, variabletype text, value double, variabletimestamp timestamp,  PRIMARY KEYvariabletype, nearest10minutes, variabletimestamp  WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY variabletimestamp ASC codepre  pThe codevariabletimestampcode is the actual time when the codevaluecode is sensed. The codenearest10minutescode is the timestamp, but rounded to the nearest 10 minutes. For example if the variabletimestamp is code19112013 131319.562code, the nearest10minutes is code19112013 131000.000codep  pI can get rid of the variabletype in the cluster key and put it into a secondary index, but Im not sure does that aid my case. p  pThe issue is that Im not really sure how to properly order data. If I take a codeselect  from myproject.variablescode just for testing purposes, I get something like timestamps showed onlyp  precodeTue Nov 19 131952 CET 2013 Tue Nov 19 131955 CET 2013 Tue Nov 19 134004 CET 2013 Tue Nov 19 134014 CET 2013 Tue Nov 19 134029 CET 2013 ...

Tue Nov 19 143000 CET 2013 Tue Nov 19 143001 CET 2013 codepre  pNow, Im not really clear should I get some default ordering or not If I use a codeselect  from myproject.variables order by variabletimestamp asccode then I get an error stating I may only use ORDER BY if the partition key is filtered with EQ or IN. And IN can only be used with the second portion of the partition key, not the first one. p  pAll in all, Im a bit confused, how can I model this in a way I can select and order my datap  pAnswerp  pSo in a way all the current answers by jorgebg and BryceAtNetwork23 and comments from  Mikhail Stepura have shown me the path I consider right. Since I wanted to keep the partitioning as random as possible but in a way that I can predict it so I can have ordered queries and use the IN keyword so I can put multiple partition keys in the query, I just decided to make a custom partitioning key. The scheme I chose is concatenating variabletypetimestamproundedbythehour. That introduces some client leaking of the storage logic, I know, but it is fairly easy to recreate the set of partitioning keys on query in the code.p  pThe answer I chose was the one that contributed the most.p

Negative 5614 pIm trying to communicate between a parent directive and its nested child directive, and the other way. Ive managed to achieve this by using broadcast and emit, but because Im passing in some arguments to the directives Ive had to create isolated scope on my directives, so in order for the broadcastemit to work I have to broadcast up a level on the parent scope scope.parent.broadcast. Now the broadcast is no longer just going to the nested child, but to all directives at the same level, which I dont want. Ive created a plunker to show the issue, a hrefhttpplnkr.coedit0l5kjZdDv1LQwarXJC9tppreviewherea. What I need is for when one of the buttons is pressed, only the child directive to receive the broadcast message, and viceversa.

Negative 5614 pIve implemented a Keylistener in Java, which basically works, but if I hold a key pressed, it seems that all the KeyEvents are stacked and executed one after another. Generally, I want this behavior, but since the methods called on a Key Event take some computation time, I would like to block the Keylistener to accept Events while already executing a method called from a previous KeyEvent.

Negative 5614 pWe have a little bit of a complicated setupp  pIn our normal code, we connect manually to a mysql db. Were doing this because I guess the connections django normally uses are not threadsafe So we let django make the connection, extract the information from it, and then use a mysqldb connection to do the actual querying.p  pOur code is largely an update process, so we have autocommit turned off to save time.p  pFor ease of creating test data, I created django models that represent the tables, and use them to create rows to test on.

Negative 5614 pI have a query that polls a table for scheduled ETL tasks to initiate. The query gives me the package name and the required parameters to be fed to it.

My problem is that I am getting confused on Controllers, since MVC has a controller itself along with AngularJSs own controllers and I am not sure how to connect the two.p  pWhat I have thus far is the following.p  pstrongMVC Controller condensedstrongp  precodepublic class TestController  Controller     private MoviesEntities db  new MoviesEntities         public ActionResult account                      return Viewdb.Users.ToList.OrderByx gt x.name           codepre  pstrongMVC Viewstrongp  precodemodel IEnumerableltWebApplication2.Entities.Usergt       ViewBag.Title  account     Layout  ViewsSharedLayoutTest.cshtml   Styles.RenderContentstyle.css ltdiv ngappappgt     ltdiv ngcontrollerAccountControllergt         ltinput typetext ngmodelsearch.gt         lttable classtable tablestripedgt             lttr ngrepeatactors in Modelgt                 lttdgtactors.namelttdgt                 lttdgtactors.summonerlttdgt             lttrgt         lttablegt     ltdivgt ltdivgt  Scripts.RenderScriptsangular.js Scripts.RenderScriptsangularroute.min.js Scripts.RenderScriptsapp.js codepre  pNow at this point I tried adding a reference to my codeapp.jscode file but no data is shown or displayed, just a table with actors.name and actors.summoner. I  have been searching and trying to find some tutorial on this basic implementation but cannot find a thing. If someone could show me what to do and explain why this isnt working thatd be awesome I think the use of Controllers is just throwing me off, and I am not sure how to turn my codefactorycode in codeapp.jscode into holding the database table values.p  pstrongapp.jsstrong plunker demo of what I am trying to implement onto MVC now  stronga hrefhttpembed.plnkr.couhwXJ456OyRFQbXnz1rSpreview relnofollowDemoastrongp  precodevar app  angular.moduleapp, [ngRoute]  app.configfunction routeProvider      routeProvider      .when,          templateUrl pageshome.html,         controller HomeController           .whenhome,          templateUrl pageshome.html,         controller HomeController           .whenlogin,          templateUrl pageslogin.html,         controller LoginController           .whenaccount,          templateUrl pagesaccount.html,         controller AccountController           .whenunknown,          templateUrl pagesunknown.html,         controller UnknownController            .otherwise           redirectTo unknown           app.factoryuserService, function       return          users [             name John,             password 12345,             email johnnygmail.com,             phone 2384912138         ,              name Austin,             password intern,             email aandersongmail.com,             phone 1384901251         ,              name Sally,             password noob,             email Sally123gmail.com,             phone 2434210738         ,              name Bilbo,             password Baggins,             email oneRinggmail.com,             phone 1584912138         ,              name Marco,             password Wafflez,             email waffleLordgmail.com,             phone 9354912654         ,              name Sam,             password Adams,             email beeeeeergmail.com,             phone 7434912131         ,              name Willy,             password W0nk4,             email w0nkazgmail.com,             phone 6824912983         ]         app.controllerLoginController, function scope, location, userService, timeout      scope.credentials           username ,         password           scope.credentialsR           username ,         password            scope.login  function           for var i  0 i lt userService.users.length i              if userService.users[i].name.toLowerCase  scope.credentials.username.toLowerCase                  if userService.users[i].password  scope.credentials.password                      scope.messageLogin  Success                     timeoutfunction                           timeoutfunction                               location.pathhome                         , 500                         scope.messageLogin  Redirecting...                     , 500                  else                      scope.messageLogin  Incorrect login details                                   return                                scope.messageLogin  Username does not exist           scope.checkName  function           for var i  0 i lt userService.users.length i              if userService.users[i].name.toLowerCase  scope.credentialsR.username.toLowerCase                  scope.messageRegister  Taken                 return                                scope.messageRegister  Available        app.controllerHomeController, function scope      scope.title  Home   app.controllerAccountController, function scope, userService, resource      var Users  resourceTest     scope.userList  userService.users   app.controllerUnknownController, function scope    codepre  pI also used NuGet to install AngularJS, so I believe referencing codeangular.jscode at the bottom should be fine as well. p  pStarted building this layout from stronga hrefhttpsegghead.iolessonsangularjsngrepeatandfilteringdata relnofollowngRepeat and Filtering Dataastrongp  pstrongCurrent Errorsstrongp  precodeError [injectorunpr] Unknown provider resourceProvider lt resource httperrors.angularjs.org1.2.21injectorunprp024resourceProvider203C2024resource     at httplocalhost56087Scriptsangular.js7812     at httplocalhost56087Scriptsangular.js377619     at Object.getService [as get] httplocalhost56087Scriptsangular.js390439     at httplocalhost56087Scriptsangular.js378145     at getService httplocalhost56087Scriptsangular.js390439     at invoke httplocalhost56087Scriptsangular.js393113     at Object.instantiate httplocalhost56087Scriptsangular.js395123     at httplocalhost56087Scriptsangular.js724428     at httplocalhost56087Scriptsangular.js663534     at forEach httplocalhost56087Scriptsangular.js33220  codepre

Negative 5614 pI made a MySQL pooler So i can perform sql in Async threads  but soon decided to add some other database optionsSqlite. Sadly plain Sqlite seems to not fully support multiple connections making the pooler completely useless. I continued to read up about Sqlite and noticed it actually has a few thread options, one being simple multithread. p  pMy question is, how would i compile SQLite under DTHREADSAFE1 Or is it just suppose to be ran with that in the java arguments Im using Maven btwp  pAlso, im very open to different database options. For instance, does h2 support async Thanks p

Negative 5614 pSo ive looked at the other questions and I am too far along in my page to try something else. I have an input type of file and I am trying to clear it when the user decides that they do not want to use it. I have some other functionality that is set to show the file name, size, etc... based on the FILE API but for some reason I cannot get the input to clear. I am trying a few different ways to clear it but still nothing. Anyone see what I am doing wrong. I have a jQuery check to check the value of the input and it never clears. The only thing I can think of is that I am using the standard hide the input and using a link so I can actually style the file input button. p  pHere is the FIDDLE a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netL935abrL3 relnofollowJS FIDDLEap  pHere is the HTMLp  precodeltdivgt ltlabel idhuf1labelgtfileGroup 1ltlabelgt ltinput typefile idfileElem acceptimage styledisplaynone        onchangehandleFilesthis.files namefilegt lta href idfileSelect classc1button right gray tabindex0gtSelect     File to     Uploadltspan classiconcheckmarkgtltspangt ltagt ltdivgt ltdivgt ltlabel idhuf1Btnlabelgt     ltdiv classfileInfoContainergt         ltulgt             ltligt                 ltdiv idfileList classfileInfoContainergt                 ltdivgt             ltligt         ltulgt     ltdivgt ltlabelgt ltbutton idremoveFile1 classc1button red lefticon         ariacontrolshuf1gt     ltspan classiconremovegtltspangtltbgt Cancelltbgt     ltspan classhiddengtfileGroup 1ltspangt ltbuttongt ltdiv classfilenamegtltdivgt codepre  p Here is the scriptp  precodewindow.URL  window.URL  window.webkitURL BEGIN  fileSelect1 and handleFile var fileSelect  document.getElementByIdfileSelect,         fileElem  document.getElementByIdfileElem,         fileList  document.getElementByIdfileList  fileSelect.addEventListenerclick, function e      if fileElem          fileElem.click          e.preventDefault  prevent navigation to  , false function handleFilesfiles      if files.length          fileList.innerHTML  ltpgtltpgt      else          fileList.empty.append         var list  document.createElementul         for var i  0 i lt files.length i              var li  document.createElementli             list.appendChildli             var info  document.createElementspan             info.innerHTML  files[i].name     files[i].size   bytes             li.appendChildinfo                  fileList.appendChildlist         removeFile1.clickfunction event              event.preventDefault             fileList.empty             removeFile1.findb.htmlCancel             fileElem.eachfunction                  this.val                          document.getElementByIdfileElem.value               document.getElementByIdfileSelect.value                console.logfileList  was deleted             console.logfileElem  was deleted I hope               console.logthisfileList.val                  fileElem.changefunction     if this.val             removeFile1.findb.htmlCancel       else          removeFile1.findb.htmlRemove this file              function   inputfile.changefunction       var fileName  this.val      .filename.htmlfileName     codepre

Negative 5614 pIm working on a project that offloads some rendering to a native plugin I wrote for Unity, in order to make use of instancing and other advanced graphics features. Im developing it for a crossplatform release, but I work with a Mac so testing is done primarily with OpenGL. At this point, the plugin only renders a quad to the center of the screen colored with hex values. The plugin works as expected in a blank Unity project, but as soon as I incorporate it into my Oculus project, it begins behaving erratically.p  pIn the Rift, the plugins geometry draws twice, one time stretching across both eyes and another time drawing only within the bounds of the right eye. Additionally, any primitive colors I apply to the geometry are lost and the geometry appears to pick up surrounding colors on a black screen with red text, the geometry will be mostly black with some red bleeding into the lines. As soon as my green terrain is loaded, the geometry drawn by the plugin becomes green.p  pBelow is a screenshot of the geometry being drawn in a blank Unity project with nothing elsep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSVdkN.png altBlank Unity projectp  pAnd here is a screenshot of the same geometry being drawn on top of my Oculus Rift applicationp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com18sLU.png altNative rendering on top of Oculus Riftp  pHeres the creation of the vertices that Im rendering three coordinates and colorp  precodeVertex verts[4]        0.5f,  0.5f,  0, 0xFF0000ff ,       0.5f,  0.5f,  0, 0xFFff0000 ,       0.5f, 0.5f,  0, 0xFF00ff00 ,      0.5f, 0.5f,  0, 0xFFff0000 ,  codepre  pHeres the draw function, called every frame within the pluginp  precode OpenGL case if gDeviceType  kGfxRendererOpenGL      initialize model view matrices     glMatrixMode GLMODELVIEW     float modelMatrix[16]               1,0,0,0,         0,1,0,0,         0,0,1,0,         0,0,0,1,          glLoadMatrixf modelMatrix assign our matrix to the current MatrixMode      initialize projection matrix     glMatrixMode GLPROJECTION     projectionMatrix[10]  2.0f tweak projection matrix to match D3D     projectionMatrix[14]  1.0f     glLoadMatrixf projectionMatrix       Vertex layout     glVertexPointer 3, GLFLOAT, sizeofverts[0], ampverts[0].x     glEnableClientState GLVERTEXARRAY     glColorPointer 4, GLUNSIGNEDBYTE, sizeofverts[0], ampverts[0].color     glEnableClientState GLCOLORARRAY      glDrawArraysGLLINELOOP, 0, 4   codepre  pAny insight from experienced native pluginRift graphics coders would be appreciatedp

Negative 5614 pIve developed an chrome extensionkiosk app that opens up Google Chrome in a kiosk mode with 4 navigation buttons, HOME, RELOAD, BACK and FORWARD. So its basicly a application that open up Chrome in a window without omnibox but added 4 buttons. This is because the user should not be able to change url or anything else. Just navigate via the web interface and the 4 simple buttons.p  pNow this applicationextension is packed with a hardcoded url. Which means you cant change the url.p  pin my browser.html I have the following codep  precodeltwebview srchttpwww.example.com stylewidth100 height100gtltwebviewgt codepre  pand in my browser.js I have the following codep  precodedocument.querySelectorhome.onclick  function  navigateTohttpwww.example.com  codepre  pAs you can see the url is hardcoded both in html file and the javascript file.p  pMy question is.

Negative 5614 pFor something Im currently developing, I need a website to be able to download files, open them and detect when theyve been closed much like FileZillas edit functionality. In fact, I need the user to be able to select where to download the file.p  pNow, the solution that would most likely do all of the above would be using the NPAPI to communicate with the page and then do all that stuff on the client side using a plugin the user had to install ahead of time. Only issue with this is that, is that Chrome has decided to phase out support for NPAPI applications. p  pAnother solution I came up with was maybe writing and extension for Chrome and use the chrome.downloads API to sort of achieve what Im trying to. Downloading and detecting if files have been closed works, but I cant figure out any way to detect if the files have been closed. I thought perhaps about using the onChanged event to do this, but there appears no way to do that. p  pPPAPI  NaCL is also not a possibility because you cannot write any code that, say, opens a save as window as far as I know. Besides that, it does not allow access to the file system besides a sandboxed local disk.p  pDoes anyone know of an adequate solution that could help me figure this outp  pThanks,p  pAlex. p

Negative 5614 pI am making an app, where the user registration goes over 4 pages. I have a top bar with logo, and a menu bar in the bottom made from images, which will both be shown to the user on all 4 pages. Before starting to make 4 different view controllers and copying the top bar elements and my bottom menu, I wonder if there is some better way to do this. Like having one view controller and then switching in and out some views which holds the elements that need to be in the midscreen mainly to avoid copying the header a footer elements, and also to avoid my storyboard getting very messy with all the VCs Any advice on how to structure the user registration will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.p

Negative 5614 pI am writing a application in which I would have to parse the contents of a file.  I am using some library functions that do not play nice with a dynamically allocated array.  This force me to have a fixed sized array on stack.  Parsing data however, will not work if a line is only partially read and I am forced to use POSIX read to achieve this.p  precodechar buff[512]  0 int fileHandle  open scEndOfLinePPSPath , ORDONLY   if1  fileHandle      while 0 lt readfileHandle, ampbuff, sizeofbuff  1               parseampbuff  doesnt play nice with dynamically allocated memory  codepre  pThe second I start trying to limit the buffer size, I could encounter cases in which parse would fail since the file is bigger and a line would only be partially read so the parse algo has only partial data to work with.p  pIf the read buffer ends like illustrated below the parse algorithm obviously cannot get the attribute name and the next read would being with the second half of the attribute namep  pltNodegt attributeMaip  pIs there a elegant way to handle such cases while continuing to use just POSIX read  I know I could dynamically allocate memory based on file size, but as I said, dynamically allocated memory doesnt work well with the parse library.p  pThanksp  pSOLVEDp  pThanks for your inputs everyone  The problem is solved now.  I am able to use dynamic memory allocation and create buffers big enough for the entire file.p  pI was determining the file size using lseek.  Somehow, the read API reads 3 bytes more than the size reported by lseek or fstat, so the allocated buffer wasnt big enough for successful parsing.  Does this mean, lseek is not a reliable way to determine the file sizep

It turns out that it is beneficial to start   with inserting n into 12 . . . n  1 by moving right to left and   then switch direction every time a new permutation of 1, . . . , n    1 needs to be processed. The advantage of this order of generating   permutations stems from the fact that it satisfies the minimalchange   requirement each permutation can be obtained from its immediate   predecessor by exchanging just two elements in it.p      pIf such permutations are generated by a minimalchange algorithm, we   can compute the length of a new tour from the length of its   predecessor in constant rather than linear time.p blockquote  pMy question on above text How can we calculate length form predecessor in constant time if we use minimum change algorithm If possible, please give a simple example with coden3code.p

Negative 5614 h2Questionh2  pI am a hrefhttpahkscript.orgboardsviewtopic.phpf6ampt6170 relnofollowimplementing the RawInput API in AutoHotkeya via DLL calls, and have somewhat achieved success in getting the HidP functions to decode the Preparsed Data.  p  pHowever, I have encountered two slight showstoppers of issues  p  ol liIt seems that the axis values reported are exactly what comes out the sensor ie if the device reports 8bit values, you get an 8bit scale  if it reports 12bit values, you get a 12bit scale  li liThese values appear to be precalibration.br In other words, if I use DIView.exe to alter the calibration values for the device, the code still reports the same Raw values.  li ol  pIs it possible to obtain calibrated values Is that the whole point of RawInput, that it is lower level than this Have I wasted my time implementing RawInput when I needed to implement DirectInput or somethingbr Same for the scales too  I see that there are UsageMax and UsageMin values for the data, so doing a rescale ourselves eg to 065535 would not be an issue, but is there maybe a way I am missing to have RawInput return data in a standardized mannerbr Any advice on these subjects appreciated.p

Negative 5614 pMy objective is to keep two UI activities alive and to switch back and forth between them at will without having to killrestart either of them.  But there is a serious side effect of using FLAGACTIVITYREORDERTOFRONT to do this a loss of window focus when I resume a previous activity that is currently running in the background.p  pI proved this issue by spending 5 minutes creating a simple application with two Hello World activities.p  ol liThe app starts with Activity A, which simply shows a button nothing else called Launch B.li liPress this button  this executes startActivityFLAGACTIVITYREORDERTOFRONT, ActivityB.class.li liActivity B becomes active, which shows simply shows a button called Launch A.li liPress this button  this executes startActivityFLAGACTIVITYREORDERTOFRONT, ActivityA.class.li liActivity As onResume is called as expected and everything looks fine I can see Activity A content again.li liPress the devices Back key and this set of errors will occur 100 of the timeli ol  pEActivityManager  513 Reason Input dispatching timed out Waiting because no window has focus but there is a focused application that may eventually add a window when it finishes starting up.p  pIWindowState  513 WIN DEATH Window5294687c u0 com.android.launchercom.android.launcher2.Launcherp  pWViewRootImpl 8066 strongDropping event due to no window focusstrong KeyEvent  actionACTIONDOWN, keyCodeKEYCODEBACK, scanCode0, metaState0, flags0xc8, repeatCount1, eventTime14965546, downTime14965045, deviceId1, source0x101 p  pThe practical result of the window death is essentially a crash from the users point of view  Android throws the user out of the app back to the Home screen, though technically the application remains running in the background.p  pI debugged this and found that the reason Activity A is visible but doesnt have focus is because activity As strongonWindowFocusChanged is NOT calledstrong like it normally does even though onResume is called.  strongThis has something to do with the fact with Activity B is still active in the backgroundstrong even though clearly B has lost focus  onWindowFocusChangedfalse was called for B, as well as onStop.  strongI know this because after step 4 above if I immediately call finish on Activity B, Activity As onWindowFocusChangedtrue WILL be called and everything is normal.strong  The fact that Activity B is still active but not focused somehow interferes with Activity A regaining focus like it should.  Is this an Android bug or am I missing somethingp  pNote that if Activity A had multiple views in it and I were to touch one of those views after step 6 above, I would get the same Dropping event due to no window focus error, though not 100 of the time for some reason. p

Franja is time slot, Docente is the teacher and Salon is the Room. FranjaDocente represents those time slots when the teacher is available, and in the same way, FranjaSalon represents those time slots when the room are available. EspacioAcademico represents an assignment, for example Jhon Doe at 600 a.m. 800 a.m. on the room A with linear Progamming. The records on EspacioAcademico are created by an algorithm, and due to the data, maybe have a partially assignment time slot null, teacher null or room null. On oracle database, in table EspacioAcademico, i have a composite foreign key to franjaDocentes primary key and franjaSalons primary key, an it allow null values on franja, docente or salon column in EspacioAcademico Table. In FranjaDocente or FranjaSalon this is not allowed. The aim of this foreign key is prevent that you can create an assignment on time slot when the teacher, or room, is not available.p  pMy Question is stronghow i can map this relationships if any join column can be nullstrong emShould i change the join column approachCan i map this with the Transformation Annotationemp

Negative 5614 pIm making a mobile app for tv series. Basically like a tracker, to know what episodes to watch and when. And I wanted to store the information like episodes watched, user shows on a database. the info about shows I get from a rest apip  pSo the thing is I dont find the need to have a server here, I just dont know what it should do.p  pAnd the problem is Id like to make the database secure. And from what Ive read the best practice is to create a salt using a cryptographically strong random number generator and prepend it to the password and then hash the whole thing using a hash algorithm, for example the SHA256. Then I store a hashed password and the salt in the database, and when I want to check if the password is correct, just hash it again and compare to the one in database.p  pSo I have a special class in Java that can create such a salt, and all I needed to know is where and how to hash the whole thing. And what is what Im asking about. I would not like to create a server that would just hash passwords.p  pAlso another thing is how to go about implementing autologin, which I also wanted to add once I figured this out.p  pI hope its clearer now what I want to accomplish here.p

So I have installed a hrefhttpsgithub.comtwbsbootstrapsass relnofollowhttpsgithub.comtwbsbootstrapsassa and in my core SASS file I have imported the bootstrap SASS like thisp  precodeimport ..bowercomponentsbootstrapsassassetsstylesheetsbootstrap codepre  peverything loads in my application and the site is definitely using bootstrap, but whenever I try to use a glyphicon I just get a square instead of the icon. Looking in the console I can see that the path to the glyphicons is wrong. It is showingp  blockquote   pa hrefhttplocalhost58859assetsfontsbootstrapglyphiconshalflingsregular.ttf relnofollowhttplocalhost58859assetsfontsbootstrapglyphiconshalflingsregular.ttfa p blockquote  pbut it should be p  blockquote   pa hrefhttplocalhost58859assetsbootstrapsassassetsfontsbootstrapglyphiconshalflingsregular.ttf relnofollowhttplocalhost58859assetsbootstrapsassassetsfontsbootstrapglyphiconshalflingsregular.ttfa p blockquote  pNow I could edit the variables file and change this linep  precode [converter] If bootstrapsassassethelper if used, provide path relative to the assets load path.  [converter] This is because some asset helpers, such as Sprockets, do not work with filerelative paths. iconfontpath ifbootstrapsassassethelper, bootstrap, ..fontsbootstrap default codepre  pto something like thisp  precode [converter] If bootstrapsassassethelper if used, provide path relative to the assets load path.  [converter] This is because some asset helpers, such as Sprockets, do not work with filerelative paths. iconfontpath assetsbootstrapsassassetsfonts codepre  pbut whenever someone loads my project from github and bower resolves bootstrap my changes to that file will be lost. I have noted in their documentation they talk about sprockets and mincer, but I have never used these so I have no idea what they are for.p  pMy question is, can I change the font path without editing the SASS file directlyp
Negative 5614 pGood afternoon, p  pWhen I attempt to use the SMTP Appender, I get an odd error in the console.

Negative 5614 pLets suppose that I have an object, codexcode, which can accept any one of the selectors, codes1code, codes2code, ..., codesncode. Lets further suppose that the result of any one of these selectors operating on the object is an updated object of the same type. I could then chain these selectors as long as they are emunary messagesem as I wish, such asp  precodex s1 s2 ... sn codepre  pThis will take the result of codex s1code and apply selector codes2code, then apply selector codes3code to that result, and so on. I would want to apply one or more of these selectors in some order for various resultsp  precodex s8 s2 codepre  pIn Smalltalk I can do this if the selectors are unary messages. However, if my selectors are emkeyword messagesem, I can no longer do this. If codexcode individually accepts selectors, codes1code, codes2code, ..., codesncode, then the following doesnt workp  precodex s1 a1 s2 a2 ... sn an codepre  pThere is the codecode operatorp  precodex s1 a1  s2 a2  ...  sn an codepre  pBut using the emcascadingem each stage modifies the original codexcode along the way, and I do not wish to modify codexcode in this case.p  pTo chain keyword messages, I think Im left using the following syntax with parenthesesp  precode...x s1 a1 s2 a2 ... sn an codepre  pWhich makes me feel like Im programming in LISP if I have 3 or more keywrod messages.

One might have other kinds of embedded objects, or other chain of consecutive object operations where you are interested in the end result.p  pIs there a more syntactically appealing way to do this in Smalltalk Im supposing there isnt another operator, perhaps a cousin to the codecode operator say we use codeampcode for example, which would chain them, such asp  precodex s1 a1 amp s2 a2 amp ... amp sn an codepre  pSince I would like to apply the selectors in any, or nearly any, desired order for possibly different results, the selector form, codes1s2s3...code is too confining. Also, this gives a facility which already exists in other languages, such as Ruby, where it would be equivalently expressed asp  precodex.s1a1.s2a2...snan codepre  pLacking a special operator, an alternative could be to pass an array of selectorargument pairs, or perhaps a lookup table of selectorargument pairs. The lookup table requires setup for passing literals it has to be created and populated, which makes me lean toward an array since I can simply write it asp  precodex  s1. a1. s2. a2. ... sn. an  codepre  pThis is still a bit clunky, and Im not so sure this is any more elegant than just using all the parentheses. Im afraid my question may be at least partly subjective, but I am interested knowing what the best practice might be, and whether an operator exists that Im not aware of which may help, or whether one is being entertained by a Smalltalk standards body.p

Negative 5614 pWhat could be the reason that some strings are not inserted into PostgreSQL table from Javap  pThis happens after an update of source of data from API v1 to API v2. The inserted data structure is almost the same, float values are inserted, but some strings are not. And without any error the fields are just empty.p  pIt is probably some escape character but Im not able to figure out which one. And how to fix it as well. The string length is about 6k characters and its PostgreSQL representation is text.p  pHere is the storage procedurep  precode CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION adddatastringints bigint, inids integer[], instringvalues text[]       RETURNS integer AS     BODY     DECLARE       tmpid integer       tmpindex integer     BEGIN       tmpindex  0       FOREACH tmpid IN ARRAY inids LOOP         tmpindex  tmpindex 1         INSERT INTO data ts, id, stringvalue VALUES ints, tmpid, instringvalues[tmpindex]       END LOOP       RETURN tmpindex     END codepre  pThe strings are passed into the procedure like thisp  precode cs.setArray3, con.createArrayOfvarchar, String[] values codepre  pThere is one more thing If the storage procedure is modified, for the sake of debug, that only first five characters of the string are inserted, e.g. like this p  precodeINSERT INTO data ts, id, stringvalue VALUES ints, tmpid, substring0, 5, instringvalues[tmpindex] codepre  pthe first five characters are inserted as expected.p

Negative 5614 pIm trying to do the following, but it seems like conditionals are completely bypassed within the Map blockp  precodeinvert No  Map       [invert  No]          backgroundcolor green       [invert  Yes]          backgroundcolor red     codepre  pWhen invert is set to No, background color is green, when invert is set to Yes, background color is green.
