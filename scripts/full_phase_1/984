Positive 984 pI inherited an appengine coursebuilder project a couple months ago, and weve been trying to upgrade to a more recent version of coursebuilder. In order to do this, the first step is to download local version of the course.  Whenever I run appcfg.py downloadapp A projectID V versionNumber .folderToSaveTop  pIt downloads a different version of the course, one that looks like an old test version with old placeholder text, all links to lessons set to private, etc. p  pWhen I look at the versions of the course in the appengine dashboard, there is only a single version, so Im not sure what its even downloading.p  pAlternatively, it was suggested I use the ETL tool provided with coursebuilder to download the files instead, but that had a bunch of other issues associated with it as well. Previously I had asked the question directly on the a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumcategorytopiccoursebuilderforumgeneraltroubleshooting5vzidyaepsk relnofollowcoursebuilder foruma where the ETL tool was initially suggested.p  pThanks in advance for any help, Tyler Nolanp
Positive 984 pIn my Google App Engine App, I have a large number of entities representing people.

Positive 984 pI am currently testdriving Google Container Engine GKE and Kubernetes as a possible replacement to AWSElasticBeanstalk deployment.  It was my understanding that just by the virtue of my dynamic servers being in the same project as the cloud sql instance, that theyd naturally be included in the firewall rules of that project.  However, this appears not to be the case.  My app servers and SQL server are in the same availability zone, and I have both ipv4 and ipv6 enabled on the sql server.p  pI dont want to statically assign IP Addresses to cluster members that are themselves ephemeral, so Im looking for guidance on how I can properly enable SQL access to my dockerbased app hosted inside GKE  As a stopgap, Ive added the ephemeral IPs of the container cluster nodes and that has enabled me to use CloudSQL but Id really like to have a more seamless way of handling this if my nodes somehow get a new ip address.p

Negative 984 pHi Everyone this is my first post,p  pI am trying to figure a way of cropping a polygon out of an image. I have been reading other similar code. It seems that most code is based around the following processp  ul liResize the image to fit the width and height of the polygon shape,li liCreate a blank image of an unusual colour the same size,li liOverlay transparent pixels in the shape of the polygon,li liOverlay that on to the resized imageli liSet the unusual colour to be transparent...li ul  pMy problem is I do not want the code to be reliant on the unusual colour not being in the original image. Does anyone have a better method or some code which I can use to check if the unusual colour is in the image.p  pOn a side note once I have cropped them I am looking to add a border only around the top and the left sides of the shape and three pixels in the corners to achieve a rounded corner effect... if anyone has any ideas about that then please also post.p

Negative 984 pIm trying to build a level editor for a game Im working on. It pulls data from a flat file and then based on a bytebybyte search itll assemble a grid from preset tiles. This part of the app I should have no issues with. The problem is that my test version of the editor which just loads a 16x16 grid of test tiles from 00 to FF is loading in the wrong place.p  pExample The app frame looks like thisp  precodeT                                      codepre  pExcusing my horrible ASCII art, the frame essentially has a horizontal sizer on it, with 2 vertical sizers, one for the left and one for the right. Each of these has a panel in it, which each have a second sizer in them. The left sizer has a 64 pixelwide spacer in it, then a gridsizer which is later filled with images. The right second sizer is user sizable but a minimum of 960 pixels via a spacer there, then a gridsizer thats determined by the level width and height in code.p  pEssentially, for each side  theres a gridsizer inside a sizer which has a spacer for the width of the section, which are on a panel thats inside a sizer for that half of the sizer thats on the main frame. I hope this makes sense, as it confuses me at times Pp  pHeres the code that does all thisp  precode    Horizontal sizer     self.hsizer  wx.BoxSizerwx.HORIZONTAL     Vertical sizer     self.vsizerleft  wx.BoxSizerwx.VERTICAL     self.vsizerright  wx.BoxSizerwx.VERTICAL      Create the 2 panels     self.leftPanel  wx.ScrolledWindowself, style  wx.VSCROLL  wx.ALWAYSSHOWSB     self.leftPanel.EnableScrollingFalse, True     self.rightPanel  wx.ScrolledWindowself, style  wx.VSCROLL  wx.ALWAYSSHOWSB     self.rightPanel.EnableScrollingFalse, True      Create a sizer for the contents of the left panel     self.lps  wx.BoxSizerwx.VERTICAL     self.lps.Add64, 0 Add a spacer into the sizer to force it to be 64px wide     self.leftPanelSizer  wx.GridSizer256, 1, 2, 2  horizontal rows, vertical rows, vgap, hgap     self.lps.Addself.leftPanelSizer   Add the tiles grid to the left panel sizer     self.leftPanel.SetSizerAndFitself.lps Set the leftPanel to use LeftPanelSizer its not lupus as the sizer     self.leftPanel.SetScrollbars0,66,0, 0 Add the scrollbar, increment in 64 pixel bits plus the 2 spacer pixels     self.leftPanel.SetAutoLayoutTrue      self.lps.Fitself.leftPanel       Create a sizer for the contents of the right panel     self.rps  wx.BoxSizerwx.VERTICAL     self.rps.Add960, 0 Set its width and height to be the windows, for now, with a spacer     self.rightPanelSizer  wx.GridSizer16, 16, 0, 0  horizontal rows, vertical rows, vgap, hgap     self.rps.Addself.rightPanelSizer  Add the level grid to the right panel sizer     self.rightPanel.SetSizerAndFitself.rps    Set the rightPanel to use RightPanelSizer as the sizer     self.rightPanel.SetScrollbars64,64,0, 0   Add the scrollbar, increment in 64 pixel bits  vertical and horizontal     self.rightPanel.SetAutoLayoutTrue     self.rps.Fitself.rightPanel       Debugging purposes.

Theres similar code to do a 1x256 grid on the left frame but Ive no way of telling if thats suffering the same issue for obvious reasons. Both have working scrollbars but have redrawing issues when scrolled, making me wonder if its drawing the images over the entire application and just ignoring the application layout.p  pIs there something Ive missed here This is the first time Ive done anything with gridsizers, images and GUIs in general in python, having only recently started with the language after wanting to write in something a little more crossplatform than VB6  any thoughts p

Negative 984 pI read a couple of articles here that inspired my solution but wondering if im doing it the right way.p  pWhat I did was to create an event that catches an jQuery ajax errorp  precodebody.ajaxErrorfunctionxmlHttpRequest, ajaxOptions, error         if locked CheckUserAuthentication  codepre  pThen the CheckUserAuthentication goes through another ajax call to a webservice that attempts to check if authentication is still active. if it returns a value that it needs to relogin, I then prompt a modal box that displays a login form. If the ajax call fails, then its safe to assume that internet connection has been lost, so I prompt another modal box that displays a message and a js loop that checks the connection again in intervals.p  pMy first concern is that the event code above actually repeats triggering itself if it reaches to the second ajax error making it a repeating loop. So I made a variable that sets a boolean whether to lock the event to prevent this.p  pMy questionsp  p1 Am I doing it correctlyp  p2 If yes, then can I dispose an ajax exception so that i dont need to lock the .ajaxError event from retriggeringp  p3 Any other ideas much efficient that what Im doingp  pI appreciate all the helpp
Negative 984 pI am writing a utility that automates some SVN processes. All of the machines that this utility will be deployed to have TortoiseSVN installed  however, they might not be the same versions. I understand that TortoiseSVN is statically linked to a specific version of a SVN library, and that this is upgraded often.p  pWhat I want to avoid is having the checkouts that my utility creates strongandstrong updates be incompatible with TortoiseSVN. My initial idea was to use the TortoiseSVN command line arguments to invoke the dialogs, but they all require user input. I would rather this all be automatic, and the output of the SVN commands be sent to stdout. p  pIs there any way that I can gain direct access to the SVN library that TortoiseSVN uses internally Or are SVN checkouts guaranteed to be forwards and backwards compatible between minor version differences Upgrading the SVN binaries my utility uses per major version of SVN wouldnt be too much of a problem. I just dont want to mandate that every user use a specific version of TortoiseSVN.p  pTo those who suggest that I use the command lines tools for SVNp  pThe clients may not have the SVN command line binaries installed  and even if they do, there would be differences between the version that TortoiseSVN is linked to and the version the command line binaries are linked to  which could lead to incomparability.p

Negative 984 pThis comes out of my search for a smart variant of codeNSLogcode. One key feature of codeBetterLogcode is that the codeNSLogcode replacement compiles out to nothing for release and distribution builds. The proposed solution see eg a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions300673isittruethatoneshouldnotusenslogonproductioncodehttpstackoverflow.comquestions300673isittruethatoneshouldnotusenslogonproductioncodea is define a preprocessor symbol to control the definition of codeBetterLogcode depending on the kind of build. Typicallyp  precodeifdef DEBUGMODE     define DebugLog s, ...  NSLog ltp dgt , self, [[NSString stringWithUTF8StringFILE] lastPathComponent], LINE, [NSString stringWithFormats, VAARGS]  else     define DebugLog s, ...   endif codepre  pwhere codeDEBUGMODEcode would be defined as a preprocessor symbol only for debug builds.p  pHowever, in a number of cases, namely when the logging statement was built with intermediary variables, the result is a compiler warning for unused variables. Here is an examplep  precodeif error      NSString titleString  Error downloading thumbnail, will rebuild it     NSString messageString  [error localizedDescription]     NSString moreString  [error localizedFailureReason]  [error localizedFailureReason]  NSLocalizedStringCheck the URL., nil     BetterLog . , titleString, messageString, moreString   silently ignoring this error is OK. codepre  pHere all three strings yield compiler warnings. And I hate compiler warnings.p  pOf course its impossible to avoid without somehow conditionally including the variables declarations themselves. I made the following attempt, but it didnt workp  pinstead of simply defining codeDEBUGMODEcode in debug mode only, I define it all the time, with value 1 in debug mode, and value 0 in release mode.p  pThen I tried to take advantage of the compiler dead code stripping optimization p  precodeif DEBUGMODE ampamp error       snip  codepre  pThe code is OK it is correctly stripped out in release mode. Yet the compiler still emits the unused variable warnings.p  pSo the question is isnt it possible to do any better than the uglyp  precodeif DEBUGMODE if error       snip  endif codepre

Im sure these are general questions with complex answers.p  pIm not knowledgable enough to write queries and test them against the server, but am just trying to get a bit more performance out of the server that runs five WordPress sites with 200,000 page viewsmonth.p  pIve optimized the database via phpmyadmin and do that regularly, but the tuner still says there are fragmented tables. And because this is WordPress, I cant change queries in core code.p  pBut how much should I increase the variables like querycachesize and  innodbbufferpoolsize What about the other innodb variablesp  pSome of the variables suggested dont exist in my.cnf, like tablecache, and are flagged in tuner report, etc. Can I add them to my.cnfp  blockquote   pemAnd why is this block duplicated in my.cnf Can I delete the duplicateemp  precodesetvariable  innodbbufferpoolsize2M setvariable  innodbadditionalmempoolsize500K setvariable  innodblogbuffersize500K setvariable  innodbthreadconcurrency2 codepre blockquote  pBelow is the my.cnf and the output of mysqltunerp  pstrongContents of my.cnfstrongp  precodequerycachetype  1 querycachesize  8M  setvariablelocalinfile0 datadirvarlibmysql socketvarlibmysqlmysql.sock usermysql  oldpasswords1  skipbdb  setvariable  innodbbufferpoolsize2M setvariable  innodbadditionalmempoolsize500K setvariable  innodblogbuffersize500K setvariable  innodbthreadconcurrency2  [mysqldsafe] logerrorvarlogmysqld.log pidfilevarrunmysqldmysqld.pid skipbdb  setvariable  innodbbufferpoolsize2M setvariable  innodbadditionalmempoolsize500K setvariable  innodblogbuffersize500K setvariable  innodbthreadconcurrency2 codepre  pstrongOutput of mysqltunerstrongp  precode General Statistics  [] Skipped version check for MySQLTuner script [OK] Currently running supported MySQL version 5.0.45 [] Switch to 64bit OS  MySQL cannot currently use all of your RAM   Storage Engine Statistics  [] Status Archive BDB Federated InnoDB ISAM NDBCluster  [] Data in MyISAM tables 133M Tables 637 [] Data in InnoDB tables 10M Tables 344 [] Data in MEMORY tables 126K Tables 2 [] Total fragmented tables 69   Security Recommendations   [OK] All database users have passwords assigned   Performance Metrics  [] Up for 1d 6h 24m 13s 2M q [22.135 qps], 116K conn, TX 4B, RX 530M [] Reads  Writes 97  3 [] Total buffers 35.0M global  2.7M per thread 100 max threads [OK] Maximum possible memory usage 303.7M 8 of installed RAM [OK] Slow queries 0 42M [OK] Highest usage of available connections 53 53100 [OK] Key buffer size  total MyISAM indexes 8.0M46.1M [OK] Key buffer hit rate 99.6 749M cached  2M reads [OK] Query cache efficiency 32.2 685K cached  2M selects [] Query cache prunes per day 948863 [OK] Sorts requiring temporary tables 0 0 temp sorts  660K sorts [] Temporary tables created on disk 46 400K on disk  869K total [] Thread cache is disabled [] Table cache hit rate 0 64 open  24K opened [OK] Open file limit used 10 1091K [OK] Table locks acquired immediately 99 2M immediate  2M locks [] InnoDB data size  buffer pool 10.6M2.0M   Recommendations  General recommendations     Run OPTIMIZE TABLE to defragment tables for better performance     Enable the slow query log to troubleshoot bad queries     When making adjustments, make tmptablesizemaxheaptablesize equal     Reduce your SELECT DISTINCT queries without LIMIT clauses     Set threadcachesize to 4 as a starting value     Increase tablecache gradually to avoid file descriptor limits Variables to adjust     querycachesize gt 8M     tmptablesize gt 32M     maxheaptablesize gt 16M     threadcachesize start at 4     tablecache gt 64     innodbbufferpoolsize gt 10M codepre
Negative 984 pI am attempting to create a very graphically intensive android application. Almost all of the UI is based on bitmaps and I would like to support as many different devices as possible and to have the app look great in all of them.p  pIs it possible to embed different resolutions for each image and have a different image displayed on each device. I am aware of stuff like hdpi folders etc. as well has units like dip etc., but that still leaves too many variables as to how the image is displayed. I would like to not have the images scaled at all to avoid losing image quality.p  pFor instance on my high resolution device I would like an image to be exactly 100px and then on a medium resolution device I would like a lower resolution image to display and be exactly 80px. If I use display independent units, I cannot ensure that the images will be of a particular size.p  pAnyone have any ideas or suggestions on how to go about thisp

Negative 984 pI have been working on Test Automation from last few months and have been using the tool named Testcomplete. But I have noticed that the tools do not matter a lot in the field of automation. Only thing you expect from an automation tool is the ability of the tool to spit out the recognition strings for the different controls used in the test application. Apart from this, you will always have to build a automation framework which will serve your needs writing code. p  pSo my question is, Is my thinking that automation tools do not matter a lot in the field of automation correct In the sense, you can use any tools to get your automation running. Or Do the tools really matter Please ignore the costs factor of the tools. Also if I need to learn a new automation tool, then what do I concentrate on Or how do I go about learing the tool In short, what exactly does learning a tool meanp

Negative 984 pBasically Ive wrote my own parser and Im parsing a string into and expression and then compiling and storing to be reused later on.p  pFor an odd example the type of string Im parsing is

left value from where ever it may be and then the right value and turn it into an int32 or a string based on if its wrapped in single quotes.. for now, then pass both into

Negative 984 pSo, heres my situation.  We have a department that needs the ability to use queues in CRM 4.

So that any customer responses will go back to the queue to be handled by agentsp  pI originally was going to build a JavaScript customization that inserted a checkbox that said Send From Business Unit.  Toggling this would look up their department user based on the email address on the Business Unit.  I successfully got this working as a concept, but found that actually sending triggers the dreaded CrmCheckPrivilege failed.p  pWhich is good, because that means CRM is actually enforcing security.p  pSo my problem I have no idea how to replicate this functionality and its a must have for this customer group.

Negative 984 pAssume I have a javascript function codecreateMyElementcode which returns a node that can be inserted into an HTML document.p  pIn order to function properly, the code of the node created by codecreateMyElementcode has to listen for events on the global codedocumentcode at least as soon as it is inserted in the document.p  pMy first attempt was to add codeDOMNodeInsertedIntoDocumentcode and codeDOMNodeRemovedFromDocumentcode listeners to the node at creation time that add and remove the needed listener on codedocumentcode in turn.p  pHowever, the mutation events are deprecated by now and dont seem to work reliably across browsers, so I am looking for a better solution.p  pAdding the listener for events at codedocumentcode at the creation time of the node would work.

Negative 984 pI have a little iPad app which shows a MKMapView instance codemapcode. In order to save the state I try saving the codemap.regioncode to the NSUserDefaults. This works very well storing only the single values as doubles. On launching, the app combines the numbers and produces a valid codeMKCoordinateRegioncode. This happens in codeapplicationdidFinishLaunchingWithOptionscode. Now there are several problems.p  pstrong1strong Imagine You leave the app in landscape orientation. The app saves the corresponding codeMKCoordinateRegioncode. The app is terminated. Now, holding the iPad landscape, launching the app, the map doesnt show the same state as before leaving the app. And no, this is not a problem of coderegionThatFitscode. I tracked it down and this is what happens Also when it isnt visible to the user, the app starts in portrait mode. The app restores his state. After that the map is rotated into landscape mode.p  pWith other words the app saves the landscape state but restores it to portrait. If you repeat these steps the map zooms out with every launch. Not the best UX.p  pstrong2strong Even if problem one would be solved by restoring in the right orientation there is still the problem that the launching orientation could differ from the leaving orientation. I think one of the better ways to solve this is to store always the values for the portrait orientation also when the user leaves in landscape. By doing this the state would be restored properly because the app is launched initially in portrait by the system.p  pOne possible way would be to change the latitudelongitude values if the app is left in landscape. But this would be too inaccurate because codeCLLocationDegreescode differ if they are latitude or longitude.p  pAn other way and I think this would be the best way would be to simulate a rotation of the mapview or to calculate the visible region for the portrait mode when the app is left. But I really dont know how to do this. Here is the point where I need your help and your ideas.p  pI appreciate every ray of hope.   And please tell me if I think into a wrong direction.p
Negative 984 pI need to be able to convert any string representation of an object back into its original state on another computer.

Negative 984 pI understand that in mercurial you can a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq1029480368599never remove a history for a filea unless you do a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq3920197368599something like thisa. strongIs there any way to disable history for certain files from ever being createdstrong. If any other repository system is capable of doing that, please put that down as well.p  pWhy would I want that Well, in our build system, new binaries are constantly being committed which the nonprogrammers can use to run the program without compiling every time the compilation is done by the build system. Each time new binaries are committed, the old ones are useless as far as we are concerned. It is unnecessarily taking up space. If the new binary messes up by any chance, we can always revert back to older source and rebuild assuming there is a way to disable history for specific files.p

Negative 984 pI am working on a project using Googles cmockery unit testing framework. For a while, I was able to build the cmockery project with no problems. e.g. .configure, make ampamp make install etc. and it took a reasonable amount of time 12 minutes or so. After working on other miscellaneous tasks on the computer and going back to rebuild it, it becomes horrendously slow. e.g. after fifteen minutes it is still checking system variables.p  pI did a system restore to earlier in the day and it goes back to working properly for a time. I have been very careful about monitoring any changes I make to the system, and have not been able to find any direct correlation between something I am changing and the problem. However, the problem inevitably recurs usually as soon as I assume I must have accidentally avoided the problem and move on. The only way I am able to fix it is to do a system restore to a time when it was working. Sometimes restarting the machine works as well, sometimes it does not.p  pI imagine that the problem is between the environment and autoconf itself rather than something specific in cmockerys configuration.

It seems a bit weird to me but ok.p  precodeSystem.out.println13  this prints 0 codepre  pIs it ok to say in the line below, the double cast is evaluated 1st.

Greatp  pSo in the next line below we have int expression, so I guess we can apply rule 1. The int cast is evaluated 1st. It effectively says treat 1.03 as a int  dont use as much memory as you would with a double. Dont use floating point division, instead apply truncating integer division. So we have 0 right No.p  precodeSystem.out.printlnint13.0  this prints 0.3333333333333333 codepre  pOk so we have 0.33333 so the int cast is not evaluated 1st. It is as if it wasnt there. Lets propose a 3rd rulep  pRule 3 int expression means ignore the int cast altogether just evaluate the expression like the int isnt even there. p  pOk applying rule 3 to the line below, we have int but we are just going to ignore it.  1.03.0 is evaluated with floating point division and we get 0.3333333. Successp  precodeSystem.out.printlnint1.03.0  this prints 0.3333333333333333 codepre  pAnd in the last line below, again we have int but we are just going to ignore it. 1.03 is evaluated using floating point division yielding 0.3333333333 right No.p  precodeSystem.out.printlnint1.03  this prints 0 codepre  pOk now Im confused.

I just want to combine 4 specific colors and show them on the iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch. p  pI realize I can convert CMYK colors to RGBA without much difference from an optical point of view, but I guess combining colors into one color object in Objective C is my problem.  Ive looked at layering of views, blend modes of images in Quartz, etc.  Im not sure if I first need to create BMP files first, or what.

Negative 984 pSometimes procedural programming is absolutely unavoidable when processing data.p  pI am currently working on optimizing some legacy code. It uses a cursor, 63 pairs of codeIFcodecodeELSEcode statements and codeBEGINcodecodeENDcodes etc. I had hoped to reverse engineer the cursor and make it a procedural process. Now Im at the end of decoding the algorithm and I realize . . . ooops...it emhasem to be procedural because each choice made on a record depends on the outcome of the process on all the preceding records.p  pSo now Im torn...there are other choices for mixing procedural code in with SQL Server processing CLR SPs, UDFs etc.. Im a big believer in using the right tool for the job, so Im leaning towards making a .NET CLR SP for this.

Negative 984 pWhen Emacs enters a coderecursiveeditcode  for example when entering the minibuffer for a kbdMxkbd AKA codeexecuteextendedcommandcode  it seems to remember certain aspects of current state, and restore them if that recursive edit is exited with an error.  Among the bits of state restored is the codewindowpointcode of all visible windows.p  pThis means that if you have codecompilationscrolloutputcode set to codetcode, and thenp  ol liyou run codecompile ...code which is doing its thing, gradually producing output...li lithen you hit kbdMxkbd and start to enter an extended command...li lithen you pause a moment to think while a few extra lines of output are produced...li lithen think you think better of that extended command after all, and hit kbdCgkbd to cancel it...li ol  pwhat will happen is that the point in your compilation window will jump backwards to the place where it was at the beginning of step 2.  This means that the point in the compilation window is no longer at codepointmaxcode, and therefore the window stops scrolling as new output is produced.p  pI dont know about you, but as Im using Emacs normally, I tend to make at least a few recursive edits and cancel at least a few of them.  So this means that at some point, my compilation window always comes unstuck, and I have to switch to it and kbdMgtkbd every so often.p  pIs there a codecustomizecode option to disable this behavior so that the codewindowpointcode stays where it is, or a snippet of elisp which fixes the problem, or even a specific hook which is executed when a recursive edit has been exited, with enough information to tell where the point was before that edit was exitedp

Negative 984 pIs there a way in MEF 4.0 to get create a part directly from a catalog  I know that there was a container in the previous version, but that seems to have been abstracted away.p  pstrongEditsstrongp  pTo clarify, I have an external package download module.  A package is my terminology for a XAP external to my main application which I use a codeDeploymentCatalogcode to download.  When the asynchronous call returns the module then returns an codeIPackagecode instance which contains metadata and initialization entry points for the package.  I want to do this for convenience.  If I use an includemany, it is a little two decoupled in this one spot.  p  pOther parts of the application i.e. the navigation module do use includes.p

Negative 984 pI already have a working rope animation using rectangular bodies with revolute joints between.  The problem with this simulation in box2d is that if I connect anything fairly dense at the end of the rope, all the chains start drifting apart.p  pIve read on several forums mainly a hrefhttpforums.tigsource.comindex.phptopic13873.0 relnofollowhttpforums.tigsource.comindex.phptopic13873.0a and a hrefhttpbox2d.orgforumviewtopic.phpf8ampt1527ampstart10 relnofollowhttpbox2d.orgforumviewtopic.phpf8ampt1527ampstart10a that it is possible to achieve a strong rope in box2d using either a prismatic joint or distance joint, or some hybrid of the two, to connect the dense object on the end of the rope to a body at the opposite end of the rope, thus having a maximum distance constraint for the entire rope length and preventing the revolute joints from falling apart.p  pHow I can use, or even modify, either b2PrismaticJoint or b2DistanceJoint to achieve a max distance constraint while still preserving the swinging motion of the ropep  pThanks for any help you can givep

Negative 984 pIm developing an online timesheet submission system in ASP.NET C sharp and I want to submit all of the input data from various controls into an SQL server database. Nothing I have seen online deals with multiple control values into the same destination database yet. The controls are stored in cells of an HTML table for structure.

Other controls include non readonly textboxes for user names and other textboxes for comments. Ideally, upon clicking Submit My Timesheet, I want all of the information saved to an SQL database.p

Negative 984 pHere is what I have a custom codeDrawableGameComponentcode, containing children in which I call some codeDrawUserPrimitvecode. Each of the child can contain children etc. I store in each component a list of the vertices describing its shape, and a codeMatrixcode to store its relative position and eventually transformation. So before I codeDrawUserPrimitivecode, I need to apply a matrix. This matrix must be the multiplication of the components transformations and of its parent and its parents parents etc.p  pThis system allow me to keep the components variable independant and if I understood correctly, thats the way to go.p  pTo do so I saw the codeBasicEffectcode object in XNA, with which I can apply some matrices.

Negative 984 pProblem solved I have a jsf2springhibernate project and everytime I click a button both the constructor and postconstruct in the bean are being called and the actual click listener that I want to execute is being ignored.

Negative 984 pIm just getting into Backbone, and one thing that I dont understand is why the on method for models always takes three argumentsevent, handler, and context.p  pIt seems that almost always this is used for context and I havent seen any other usage. Even if there were, since I havent seen one yet it must be pretty rare.p  pSo my question is When does one use a context other than this, and why is Backbone designed this way By the way, I do understand why you need to provide context, its just that I wonder why the method syntax specifies that I use three arguments instead of making the last argument optionalwhich seems to be always this and feels redundant. Im sure Im missing something. Please someone help me understand.

When i call the function treeview, it reverts my logic, for example, previously when i click on the folder it gives me expandable when the folder is closed and give me collapsable when the folder is open, now, after i call the function treeview, it gives the opposite result, it is, when the folder is closed the class is collapsable and when the folder is open the class of parent ul is expandable, anyone have any idea of what it can bep
Negative 984 pI was under the impression that the FormHelper not only automatically protects me from SQL injection, but also per default escapes special characters like the HtmlHelper does. However, when I have     p  precodeltphp echo thisgtFormgtinputfield, arrayescape gt true gt codepre  pAnd then enter amp and  for example into the field and hit save. These special characters get saved to the database without any escaping. This also happens without setting the option escape to true.

Negative 984 pI am writing an Android app that among features has a chat module. I have choose to implement the chat using long polling.p  pBecause I am trying to avoid eating up the user phone battery I thought about adding to the implementation a GCM messages platform to notify the device about new messages.p  pThe idea is to use long polling while the user has the app open on his screen so engaging in a real time chat would be fast and does not involve sending a lot of GCM messages, while when idle, the server will know that the user is not currently polling and will send the device a GCM message to wake it up when a new message arrives.p  pI am struggling with a few issues implementing this methodp  ol lipWhat is the best way to know the status of the user  Is hes polling right now or waiting for the push message to wake it up. Should I set the app to notify the server when it goes to sleep or the server should detect it by itselfpli lipIf I set it so the app will notify the server when to switch between modes, how do I recover in cases this notification did not got through. when the client is waiting for gcm and the server thinks its polling and will not send one..pli lipI experienced some case where the client was polling and the server did not responded even when it got new messages. Maybe some kind of timeout on the server that the client is not aware of...

Negative 984 pI have a screen displaying a complex layout that shows several different modules, portlet kind each of them is a different twig template and a controller call.p  pIn case of exception from one of the controllers call, i want to fill this square with a brief excerpt from log if its configured in that way, but i want other modules to be displayed normally, and js plugins working. There will be a small square in the middle of the page blank or showing the log. Im not working with ESI.p  pSo far Ive tried to apply different approaches   an exception listener, where I can obtain an stack trace and show a custom error twig template   using an alt controller call from the previous twig controller renderp  pIve seen I cannot mix this two approaches,    when using alt there no event raised, nothing to listen, alternative controller has no info about exception to show    without alt, my error template is shows full screen, so no other modules are shown.br    the same with the standard ouput error or even if I override ExceptionController.p  pIn this moment Im considering these options    alt, for every controller call in the page, keep in APC the profile token number for this request I couldnt achieve yet,  in order to use it from the alternative controller and search logs at profile collector    exception listener together and alt, find in the framework when error is detected, raise event but also launch alt, and make it compatible.p  pany help will be appreciatedp

This is good and what I want.p  pHowever, when you click the orange button multiple times and create multiple synths. When you push a key on the keyboard all of them play which is what I want but only the last created one seems to respond to the keyup event.I want all of them to respond to the keyup event.Not just the last one.p  pI am not sure how to fix this.p  pEach dynamically created div has a unique ID but also a class that is universal to all of them. I thought there might be a way to select the class   synth.class and launch a universal oscillator.disconnect on keyup p  pAnother thing Im thinking is my problem might need some kind of iterating thread that compensates for whatever DOM issue is causing this assuming it isnt just exclusively the programming thus far. But I am not sure.p  pThe Javascript code is below. I tried to keep it as minimal as possible but I couldnt figure out how to make it any smaller than this and still have it be clear.

Negative 984 pIs it possible that you disable setting cookies in javascript while stil being able to read them  In my website i set cookies only in php, but it would be usefull that i can read them from Javascript. I know there is a httpOnly flag while creating cookie but that restrict read and write access from Javascript. The reason why i want to restrict write access is of course security as user can easily set cookie even from browser and i want to prevent that.p

They can update this page, and when they fill out the form to do that and submit it, those variables are passed onto the preview page. If they like the preview page, that confirm it submitting a form that executes submitpreview.p  pHere is my problem All the session variables that are being filled by the form everything but company id, which is stored in a session when they first log in are immediately dumped into a session variable. I have echoed out those session variables at the bottom of the preview page just to confirm they are not empty at this point in time, and their contents are echoed out appropriately when I get to the preview page. However, when the user confirms the changes and submitpreview is set, suddenly those session variables are empty. That is, all the session variables that were filled by the form variables are empty. The session variables that echoed out just fine before the page was refreshed are gone except for the companyid variable. Since the companyid session variable is still just fine, so I know that 1 sessions on my server must be working right and 2 the problem lies with the code that is either dumping the form variables into the sessions or retrieving those variables. Any theories as to why this may be occurringp  pThis has me pretty frustrated. I appreciate your patience with me on this issue and appreciate any help that is given.p

I have a function that parses through the QTextEdit string and returns an a start and end integer of where an error is located. My original strategy was to use HTML tags at these two points to highlight the error. Unfortunately there appears to be an issue with html tagging and the equation syntax. p  pWhat I think I need is a strategy that relies on Qts library to set a background color between these two indices. I began looking a a hrefhttpqtproject.orgdocqt4.8qsyntaxhighlighter.html relnofollowQSyntaxHighlightera however I think that this is more for highlighting using a predefined set of laws and not for just grabbing up anything between a amp b and setting the background color. If I can use syntax highlighter please provide me with and example or reference as I have already read through the documentation and didnt find anything. p  pThanks for any help in advance p  pP.S. Just to emphasize on the html compatibility issues html becomes problematic due to multiple lt and  signs used. p

Its currently viewable live here a hrefhttpimages.oneightynyc.com relnofollowhttpimages.oneightynyc.comap  pNow if you take any series of regular sized images under 5mb and proceed to upload them, the upload process goes just fine. Uploads the files, and brings you to a page that displays the link codes to those files. However lets say you upload a few large images, like the followingp  pa hrefhttpimaging.nikon.comlineupdslrd90imgsamplepic005b.jpg relnofollowhttpimaging.nikon.comlineupdslrd90imgsamplepic005b.jpgap  pa hrefhttpimaging.nikon.comlineupdslrd90imgsamplepic003b.jpg relnofollowhttpimaging.nikon.comlineupdslrd90imgsamplepic003b.jpgap  pThe uploads happen in the process, however the script never brings you to the uploaded page. The only way I am aware that the upload has actually taken place is if I browse to the Gallery page and see that the files are listed there. p  pHere is the uploader.php file which handles the uploadp  precodelt obstart sessionstart authidSESSION[userid] if authid  emptyauthid  authid authid  0  requireonceconfig.php  requireoncelimits.php  requireonceftp.class.php requireoncefunc.php   link  mysqlconnectdbserver, dbuser, dbpassword or dieCould not connect to the database.  mysqlselectdbdbname or dieCould not select the database.  if config[Uploads]  0   msg ltcentergtltbgtltbrgtltbrgtltbrgtUploads are temporarily disabled by the site adminltcentergtltbgt   else if config[Uploads]  1 ampamp authid   msg ltcentergtltbgtltbrgtltbrgtltbrgtYou have to lta hrefregister.php titleRegistergtRegisterltagt before you will be able to upload photos.ltcentergtltbgt    query  select count as total from ftp where status1  result  mysqlqueryquery or dieQuery failed.   while row  mysqlfetcharrayresult    totalrow[total]    iftotallt0            noserver1      ftpid0      urlserverurl.images        else    query  select  from ftp where status1 ORDER BY RAND limit 1  result  mysqlqueryquery or dieQuery failed.  while row  mysqlfetcharrayresult                     noserver0          ftpidrow[ftpid]          pathrow[name]                  urlrow[dir]                  hostrow[host]                  userrow[user]                  passrow[ftppass]                        get variables for fields on upload screen                          tos  POST[tos]                  prv  POST[prv]                          ifprv1                  prv0            uploaderip  SERVER[REMOTEADDR]          messages          msg          newID          FileName          FileFile          FileUrl          FileUrlLink          FiletnUrl           check for blocked ip address          if uploaderip                     query  select ip from blocked where ip  uploaderip              result  mysqlqueryquery or dieQuery failed.                  numrows  mysqlnumrowsresult                    if numrows gt 0                           msg Your IP address .uploaderip. has been blocked from using this service.                                 if config[AcceptTerms]1  if tos                                         msg You must check the box stating you agree to our terms.                      echo ltscript languagejavascriptgtparent.upload.msg.,.newID.,.messages.,.FileName.,.FileFile.,.FileUrl.,.FileUrlLink.,.FiletnUrl.,.pageurl.,.serverurl.,.sitename.,.HotLink.ltscriptgt                                      ifmsg      check for a file  fori0ilt14i            err0          thefile  FILES[thefile.i]                     if thefile[name]                               check for valid file extension  pathparts  pathinfothefile[name]  fileext  strtolowerpathparts[extension]           if err  0                                              check for valid file type                          if inarraynocasefileext, validfileext                                                                             messages. ltemgt.thefile[name].ltemgt is not in a valid format .validmimetypesdisplay.                                            err1                                                                                if err  0              check for valid image file imageinfo  getimagesizeFILES[thefile0][tmpname]  iferegiimage,imageinfo[mime]   messages..

Negative 984 pI have a Google Spreadsheet with 13 sheets.  Each sheet has the same formatting and layout but the data varies.  The ranges I need from each sheet are F7G13 and cell F2. Each row within the F7G13 range should be paired with Cell F2 and placed into 3 adjacent columns in another workbook well call it Workbook2.  So if there is a data point in column F there will be a data point in the adjacent G cell.  As long as there is data in the GF range then the contents of cell F2 needs to be copied over too.p  pSome potential problems...br The number of rows in the FG range will vary from 0 to 7 on any given sheet.

Negative 984 pSo far I have set up my build with the Clean Workspace option set to All.

Negative 984 pNormally when you click on a select element, the option you have selected is highlighted by default and as you scroll to other options the highlight follows the pointer. For some reason all of my selects are broken, when you scroll to other options the highlight jumps back to the original selected option and a small bit of highlight is visible underneath the element you are on on the outside margins. When you click on an option things work normally and it gets selected even though the highlight is visually being shown somewhere else, but I cant figure out whats causing it to act this way.p  pImage of problem p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comn2qxz.png altenter image description herep  pIn this example people was the selected option, and I have the pointer over clubs, as you can see its very hard to tell what you are selecting.

Negative 984 pSo, I pulled Arial over onto Linux from my former Windows distribution, but I then had to fight with the a hrefhttpcodemuse.com20091104ubuntussmallarial relnofollow12px Arial issuea. I fixed that as suggested by resizing it to 13px, but I decided that I actually much preferred Google Calendar in Liberation Sans as Id had it before.  Ive used Stylish to fix that for the main part of the calendar, but I cant get the Google Tasks section to use Liberation Sans because it uses much more complexstrange CSS selectors.

Negative 984 pI am moving to Angular from Knockout, and I have a few issues. Im assuming that I must be doing something a nonangular type of way.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netLostInDaJungleBxELPhttpjsfiddle.netLostInDaJungleBxELPap  precodeI linked to jsfiddle so I didnt have to include my code here Stack Overflow will not let me post my question without a code block. codepre  pHere is a very basic fiddle that outlines two of my major problems...p  pProblem 1 val1 and val2 are initialized as 3 and 4, and add up to 7 properly. However, if you change either of the values in the text boxes, the new value is treated as a string and I get concatenation instead of addition. Change val1 to 4 and you get 44 when it should be 8. What is the best way around this behaviourp  pProblem 2 Calculated fields. I can get a calculated field by using the curly brackets like val1  val2 and have the calculated fields auto update when the underlying model changes, but this is totally unacceptable. In my full fledged app, we generate a cost that is used several times throughout and having to put in the cost calculation each and every time is a pain. Not to mention that when this calculation changes, I now have the unenviable task of finding 15 different places that use the cost calculation and updating them all.p  pIn addition, if I try to put an ngmodelcost on the input with the curly brackets, then the curly brackets dont work. So nothing jumps out at me as a way to bind cost.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netLostInDaJungleQNVwehttpjsfiddle.netLostInDaJungleQNVweap  pThis example is more like the structure I desire. However, unlike a ko.observable, the calculated fields do not update when the values that generate them change. The boilerplate solution everyone has foisted on me is to write a bunch of ngchange handlers... But that is awful. If width changes change the cost and change the payback calculations, etc... It quickly becomes a tangled mess.p  pBoth of these methods fail as far as separating logic from presentation. Method one has my business logic embedded in my HTML. Method two puts a whole bunch of ngchange handlers in my code which isnt that much different from having to write a whole mess of onChange handlers in plain ol HTML. If I HAVE to do a bunch of ngchange handlers, I would just as soon do an onChange handler in Javascript because I can at least declare them outside of my presentation layer.p  pHeres a knockout version of the samep  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netLostInDaJungleeka4S2httpjsfiddle.netLostInDaJungleeka4S2ap  pThis is more like what I would expect... Nothing but databinds on my inputs, all program logic nicely contained within the view model. Also, since my computable is a Javascript function, I dont have to scratch my head about how to ensure my two values are numeric.p  pSo....p  pComputed variables Is there a way to watch the underlying variables and update the computed amount automatically Without having to bury my program logic in my HTMLp  pIs there a good way to keep my numbers from turning into stringsp  pThank you for your help.p  pFYI, also posted to Google Groups a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicangular0dfnDTaj8twhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicangular0dfnDTaj8twap
Negative 984 pIm using entity framework for retrieving a complex object which consists of properties and collections and these collections could also consist of collections. The data itself is pretty small but the structure is quite complex. A simple example in reality there are more properties and collectionsp  precodepublic class Parent      public int ParentId get set     public ICollectionltMeasurement1gt MeasurementOnes get set     public ICollectionltMeasurement2gt MeasurementTwos get set     public ICollectionltChildgt Children get set     public string PropertyOne get set     public string PropertyTwo get set...etc   public class Child      public int ChildrenId get set     public ICollectionltMeasurement3gt MeasurementThrees get set     public string PropertyThree get set  codepre  pThe above example is very simplified but gives an overview of the structure. All measurements are updated every minute by an external API and the properties could also be changed. p  pI need to load this structure from the database we are using SQL Server and pass it to an optimization algorithm. This must be done for all Parents every half hour. It takes about one second to load the structure from the database, which means that I can only optimize around 1800 Parents in the given time interval.p  pOf course I can try to optimize the queries, put on some indexes etc in the database and lower the retrieval time from the database from 1 second to say 0.7 seconds. Then I can at most optimize around 2500 Parents, but the requirement is 10000 db access time must be less than 0.18 seconds. I dont know how much the performance would increase if I instead of using Entity framework wrote Stored procedures, however for me it seems that the object structure is the real issue because in order to retrieve all data multiple roundtrips to the database is required. p  pSince the data of a Parent is changed quite a lot between each interval I dont know if caching is the way to go. p  pDoes anyone have any experience from a similar issue or any suggestions on how I should do in order to decrease the database access time by a factor 10p

Negative 984 pI looked on the web for several days but cant find a answer for my problem. Maybe I have more luck here. p  pThis is the problem Im facing, I have several old codebases, say 30 and through the years it grew by copy and past and adding custom code to each codebase. For the record none of them are in any way managed by any type of source controle now. p  pNow I want to use GIT to control all the sources. The main goal I want to achieve is to create a new Master repository from all the different code sources and make sure that if a part gets into the new Master repo it can from thereon be maintained into one place.p  pHere are some of the ideas I have and please correct me if Im saying things wrong.p  p1  Creating a new repo of the best codebase I have and make a branch for each codebase inside this new repo. This way I can eventually merg the good parts of each codebase into the Master. So in time the Master will gather all the best parts and I can pull the best code back into each separate codebase. Every new bugfix will then be fixed in the Master and pulled by all the others.  p  p2  Create a new Master repo and use patching to gather al the pieces from the different codebases. But how can I maintain the code in a proper way and do bug fixing in one place Do I have to patch it back into each separate codebase Or do I change the remote and pullpush it backp  p3  Create a new Master repo and use cherrypicking to gather al the pieces from the different codebases. But how can I maintain the code in a proper way and do bug fixing in one place Do I have to cherrypicking it back into each separate codebase Or do I change the remote and pullpush it backp  pIf anybody should have any info, tips or whatever please share because Im sure there will be more people facing this issue.  p  pThanks.p

The user could then simply doubleclick and open the page in their favourite browser, where the JS would be executed to handle the user interactions with the database and so on. On first running the sqlite database would be created on the users machine which would persist the data and could also be backed up as needed.p  pMy question is, how can I go about creating and modifying the database file from within the browser Traditionally this has been a big nono for obvious security reasons but looking into things like app.js and others I feel like there might be another option for achieving this simply. An option might be to have a saveload dialog if nothing else. The key factor is to avoid having the user install any extra dependencies like node.js etc, as this is a very simple tool. p

Negative 984 pUsing Oracle SQL Developer, you can export databases to SQL scripts INSERT statements only using the Tools  Database Export menu entry. The problem is that the table are exported in the alphabetical order, and it doesnt seem to be possible to change that order or I didnt find how to proceed at least.p  pIt is a problem because, when you have foreign key constraints, its possible that the exported SQL script cant be imported back, since parents must have been inserted before children. Lets say B is the parent and A the child, the simplified Oracle SQL Developer exported SQL script file will bep  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecodeINSERT A lt error B is needed INSERT B codepre  pSo, has anyone a solution top  ul lieither export a database with automatically ordered tables insert statements depending on the foreign key constraints,li lior export a database while manually specifying the order of the tables insert statements,li lior disable temporarily the foreign key constraints to be able to import a script alphabetically ordered, and reenable the constraints afterwardsli ul  pp  pPS the idea is to let the tables structures as is, and only to import data.p

Negative 984 pIm doing some form validation on a job application and adding a class when an element is not filled out properly. Ive got some html and jQuery below that is removing that class from a particular set of elements, if the applicant checks a do not selfidentify checkbox. I am having trouble finding out a cleaner way of referencing the spans. I also included portion of an onclick event that I have triggered on the do not selfidentify checkbox that disables the same elements that I am removing the class from. In that section of code you will see some commented out lines where I was unsuccessful in referencing the spans.

Negative 984 pUsing Foundation 4 buttons allows you to customize design using the mixins. This is the same for most elements.p  pHowever, there are many settings that the mixins dont expose to customization, e.g. Font color Hover effect Border colorp  pThese are all calculated based on the button background color.  The button is just an example, but I have the same issue with all other elements.p  pIs there a recommended way to customize parts which are not exposed by the mixin I dont want to go into the source and change the actual mixin definition. If my design spec is very different from Foundation defaults, would it be better to not use Foundationp

Negative 984 pThere are some great answers relating to when to use a UIViewContoller vs. a UIView. For example a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1690852whentouseauiviewvsauiviewcontrollerontheiphone1690915herea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11173024shouldiuseuiviewcontrolleroruiviewmakingacustomtabbarnavcontrollerherea.p  pThe general gist is that a UIVIewController should be used to control a full screen of data, becausep  ol lipIt is designed to handle rotation. Only one UIViewController should be on the screen at once because a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma16916811161906only the newesta will be notified that the rotation occurred. pli lipTo stay true to the MVC paradigm, your business logic should live in a UIViewController, while only display and interaction logic should live in a UIView. Presumably business logic relates to whats on the entire screen. pli ol  pMy question is, given this, how do I structure an app with leftright paging between several toplevel views p  pI want to create an interface with several UITableViews holding a list of recipes. The user swipes left and right to navigate between lists. There is a common menu on the bottom that stays fixed no matter what. p  pMy initial thought is to use one UIVIewController for the UIScrollView, then add subviews from there. p  pHowever Id really like each list to have its own UIViewController, so it can handle its own rotation, and hold business logic like its own REST methods. It would seem to be a pain to have the toplevel UIViewController handle the rotation of a child subview, and it would seem to be a violation of MVC to put the logic anywhere else. p  pIs there a way to structure an app so that multiple UIViewControllers live inside a UIScrollView, or would it appropriate to use a series of toplevel UIViewControllers and UISwipeGestureRecognizer to simulate the paging effect of the UIScrollView p  pThanks. p

Negative 984 pI have to pass medical image data retrieved from one proprietary device SDK to an image processing function in another  also proprietary  device SDK from a second vendor.p  pThe first function gives me the image in a planar rgb formatp  precodeint mrcpgkretrieveframeuint16t r, uint16t g, uint16t b, int w, int h codepre  pThe reason for uint16t is that the device can be switched to output each color value encoded as 16bit floating point values. However, Im operating in byte mode and thus the upper 8 bits of each color value are always zero.p  pThe second function from another device SDK is defined like this p  precodeBOOL processcpgkimageconst PBYTE rgba, DWORD width, DWORD height codepre  pSo we get filled three buffers with the following bits 16bit planar rgbp  precodeR 0000000 rrrrrrrr  00000000 rrrrrrrr ...

Some points however might be out of R.pli lipLet r be an arbitrary aspect ratio, possibly different from R aspect ratio.pli ul  pIs there a known algorithm to size and position a rectangle R with aspect ratio r, that is fully intersecting R, so that R n C is maximal n for intersect, dont know how to input MathML here.p  pI tend to think a perfect solution might not exist in polynomial time, so good approximates will do the job, even iterative solutions that can be stopped after a timeout.p  pI expect R and R to be non rotated, i.e. their sides are either parallel to unit vector or perpendicular to it. But a solution where two sides of R are parallel to two sides of R, and both are rotated arbitrarily will fit perfectly, I would be in a specific case then.p  pThanks you much,p  pMathieup

Negative 984 pI am a scientist recently converted from MATLAB to Python. I am looking for ways to structure my mainly 2D and 3D datasets. I have searched the net quite a bit, and it seems to me that robust emandem generalpurpose data structuring in Python is still somewhat up in the air. I think this question and any answers will be highly relevant for other Python scientists looking for a way to structure data in a way that allows focusing on the problems at hand rather than the underlying implementation.p  pOne example of the structure of my data is emtime x altitude x parameterem, where emparameterem is e.g. density, temperature, etc. For the time dimension, I would like to use codedatetimecode objects, since this seems very robust and facilitates easy conversion, formatting, etc.p  pSo far, Ive looked into Pandas and MetaArray from the SciPy cookbook.p  pPandas main drawback as a data type is that its much more than just that. Each dimension in e.g. a Panel items, major axis, minor axis seem to have certain preferred uses, though I can not figure out which. The indexing in particular is different depending on the dimension, and some dimensions may not be expanded after creation of the data structure. Thus, even though some of Pandas functions like grouping code.groupbycode is really useful for a small part of my work, Pandas is not really intuitive for interactive scientific work, and I find myself looking for other options as my daytoday data type.p  pI have also looked briefly into a hrefhttpwiki.scipy.orgCookbookMetaArrayMetaArraya from the SciPy cookbook. This looks more like a cleancut data type, and the indexing seems really intuitive and flexible, making it much more suited to interactive scientific work. However, it is not AFAIK part of any package, and needs to be downloaded and installed manually, which makes portability more difficult if I need to collaborate with other scientists. Also, I find almost no examples of it being in use, and thus it seems rather like an adhoc solution to the problem of structuring Ndimensional datasets.p  pI have also heard of Blaze, purported as the nextgeneration of NumPy, but as far as I can see thats still very much in early development. Experiences with Blaze are welcomep  pThus, I would like some examples modules, packages, etc. of how Ndimensional datasets in particular 3D may be structured in Python, most importantly in order to easily facilitate interactive use.p

Negative 984 pIve been developing an Android guitar app, and currently Im having some problems with codeHashMapcode.p  pTo sum it up, I get a strongnullpointer exceptionstrong when I try to retrieve a value from a codeHashMapcode with codegetkeycode despite codecontainsKeykeycode returning codetruecode for that key.p  pSpecifically, I have an instance codecurrentPresetcode of a class, which has a codeHashMapcode called codemaxCoordRangecode, which is initialized in the class like this   p  precodeprivate MapltString, Floatgt maxCoordRange  new HashMapltString, Floatgt codepre  pThis parameter is not modified in the constructors of the class.

Negative 984 pI want to create a database of users who can then like each other. When a user, for example user 1, likes user 2 then this should be stored. If user 2 subsequently likes user 1 then they should both be informed.  I cant quite work out how I would structure the SQL tables for this. The way I would like to implement this would be to create an array of likes for each user where the users they like are stored. So if user 1 liked user 2,3,4 and 5 this is then stored in user 1s like array. If user 1 is then liked by user 2 then user 1s like array would be checked for user 2.p  pAs far as I know arrays arent available in SQL, so what would be the simplest alternative to thisp

Negative 984 pI have implemented an activity that displays fragments in a viewpager. The activity initially displays 5 fragments of a given type type A. Each type A fragment contains a list of information. When a button is pressed, the fragments are replaced with another tpye of fragments, type B i.e., fragments that use a different layout and display different information are loaded.p  pI have implemented this with a ViewPager and a custom FragmentStatePagerAdapter. The custom FragmentStatePagerAdapter overrides the getCount, instantiateItem, getItem, getItemPosition, etc. functions and all works fine. When I press the button the views switch from fragment type A to fragment type B. In order to do this I am using a replace fragment transaction and I also call notifyDataSetChanged on the adapter. The switch from type A to type B fragments is accomplished by checking which type of fragment I need to create in the adapters getItem function. The problem is that the switching process i.e., changing from fragment type A to fragment type B and vice versa takes some time around 2 seconds  this delay is quite noticeable and annoying.p  pThis occurs because the adapters getItemPosition function returns POSITIONNONE. When POSITIONNONE is returned, the viewPager recreates the fragment. Furthermore, when the replace transaction is executed, all items of the adapter are removed and all new ones are recreated. The same happens when I switch back to fragments type A.p  pDoes anyone know if there is a better or faster way to do this Using a FragmentPagerAdapter should not be a good solution since the number of fragments in the viewPager could grow.p  pI have commented out the updating of the fragments and the problem is gone so the problem is the time it takes to update the fragments. Is there a way to update the fragments asynchronously That should take care of the problem.p

Negative 984 pThis is my first post on Stack Overflow. If there is anything I can do to improve it please share.p  pI am trying to learn about different sorting algorithms such as insertion, selection, bubble, merge, quick, bucket, radix, heap, shell, gnome, and bogo sort and implement them in Java.p  pHow could I write a sort method which will work with any class that implements codeCollectioncode of any class that implements codeComparablecode I looked at the a hrefhttpgrepcode.comfilerepository.grepcode.comjavarootjdkopenjdk7b147javautilCollections.javaCollections.sort28java.util.List29 relnofollowsourcea of codeCollections.sortcode and it has some syntax in the method signature I dont understand.p  precodepublic static ltT extends Comparablelt super Tgtgt void sortListltTgt list      Object[] a  list.toArray     Arrays.sorta     ListIteratorltTgt i  list.listIterator     for int j0 jlta.length j          i.next         i.setTa[j]       codepre  pThe following is my best pathetic guess of how to write a codeSortNonecode method, which doesnt sort a codeCollectioncode, but has the correct method header to do so. I would call it with codeSortNone.sortmyCollectioncode where codemyCollectioncode is an instance of any class implementing codeCollectioncode of a Class implementing codeComparablecode assuming the prior import of codecom.tenembasj.sort.code, see More Info.p  precodepackage com.tenembasj.sort  public class SortNone       public staticltTgt void sortCollectionltEgt collection  dont know how to require the object is it T or E to implement Comparable         code to sort         would I have to use collection.size, .geti, .seti, and such to edit the class implementing Collection       codepre  pFurthermore, I would like to add a codesortcode method which adds a parameter for a codeComparatorcode, I just need to know what the formal parameter would be. I think I can figure out the implementation once I know how to write the regular codesortcode.p  pAgain, I am trying to write my own sorting methods and not use codeCollections.sortcode, codeArrays.sortcode, or any codeJava.utilcode method. You might say Dont reinvent the wheel, but Im just trying to learn.p  pMore Infop  pI would like to export these methods to a jar when Im done and import them as a library in my future projects. I made a new project in Eclipse, created a package called codecom.tenembasj.sortcode, and will add classes such as codeMergeSortcode. I believe this is standard naming convention, but if it isnt please tell me. My goal is to be able to type codeimport com.tenembasj.sort.code in any of my future projects and call codeMergeSort.sortmyCollectioncode or codeMergeSort.sortmyCollection, myComparatorcode.p

Im not at the moment but just for informational purposes.

Would I have to undo all the prototype work I did when the plugin gets exited so as to not interfere with anything else on the website that might be using the Image object. Something like garbage collecting in other OOP languages. Examplep  pPlugin start p  precodeImage.prototype  foobar  var image  new Image       do code here    onplugin close , function       Image.prototype.release      OR      Image.prototype  assign back to whatever it was originaly  codepre  p Plugin Endp  pHere is what I think the answers might be 1 NO But hopefully yes... 2 No prototype resetting isnt necesarry because if a jQuery plugin is wrapped inside of an anonymous function that that instance of code exists only as that one instance and it doesnt affec the global Image object, just the local instance of the Image object.p  pIm just now trying to get into prototypes. Ive done a good amout of research and I def see the benefits of using them but before I jump into them like a fool, I would like to know exactly how to use the properly and what are the things I can and cannot do.p  pThx again guysp
Negative 984 pRunning Python 2.6 and 2.7 on Windows 7 and Server 2012 p  pEventwait causes a delay when used with a timeout that is not triggered because event is set in time. I dont understand why. p  pCan someone explain p  pThe following program shows this and gives a possible explanation p  precodeShows that using a timeout in Eventwait same for Queuewait causes a delay.

Negative 984 pAgain need help from this awsome comunity.p  pI have a WinForms app with DataGridView to display some data.  There are especcialy two columns that are important to me.

Negative 984 pI have a function which should built an array with keys. Those keys will have a serie of objects as value. p  pIve some loops nested in each other and Im quite near to the solution, but inside the last loop Im making a mistake and I cant see the solution. p  pThe function loopt over an array with Ids. Those will be the key value for the output array. After that it loops over an array with a lot of objects. Those objects are having a property category. Some of them have one, others more. So with a forloop I loop over all the categories. p  pIf the categorie is the same as the id then it should push the object to the var objs, which will be added to the right key. p  pThis is all working, BUT, I want that the objects are saved with only ONE category. So I declared a new var inside the last loop, put the obj inside there and set the obj.category. Unfortunately this is overwriting the source, array[x].category. This is not good because this occurs the problem that an object with two categories will only be found once in this function and it had to be found twice so it can be saved twice once by every represent key value. p  pA lot of explanation for a little piece of code... p  precode.eachuniqueid, functioni, el     var objs  []      forvar x in array                 forvar j0 jltarray[x].category.length j                      ifarray[x].category[j]  el                              var obj  array[x]                 obj.category  el                 objs.pushobj                                data[el]  objs  codepre

Negative 984 pIm now building up an iPad app which uses codeUISplitViewControllercode and on the detail view controller I want to initialize two codeUITableViewcode. However, for some strange reasons even if I tried to initialize those two table views in the same way, only the second table view is initialized properly.p  pHeres my code that initializes the table viewsp  precode t1  [[UITableView alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake30, 400, 300, 600] t1.delegate  self t1.datasourse  self [self.view addSubviewt1]  t2  [[UITableView alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake360, 400, 300, 600] t2.delegate  self t2.datasourse  self [self.view addSubviewt2] codepre  pI set those two table views as codeproperty strong, nonatomiccode in my header file of the view controller. I dont think Ive made any mistakes so far.p  pHowever, heres the image of the resultant detail view controller. The first table view starts populating its cells after some space is filled at the top of the table view. It looks like the redundant spaces height is same to the height of the navigation bar, but when I tried to output codeself.viewcode before the codeaddSubviewcode method on the above code, I got the same result saying codeself.view  ltUIView 0x10a3dd920 frame  0 0 768 1024 autoresize  WH layer  ltCALayer 0x10a3dd800gtgtcode. So, I think its added to the same parent view.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxHSYk.png altenter image description herep  pSo what am I missing And how can I fix the issue up I suspect its related to either navigation controller or split view controller, but am not sure.p  pI use iOS 7.1 and Xcode 5.1.p

Negative 984 pDoes anyone have a simple example on how to use  SwipeRefreshLayout with a ListView Here is my situationp  pI have a class SynchDogs that pulls data from the server. So that class serves as the source for my adapter. I want to use  SwipeRefreshLayout for refreshing the adapter and so the ListView.

Negative 984 pI have been working on a piece of recording software I developed on a game called L.A. Noire. The game is able to run in a windowed mode, but they seem to have not allowed window movement.p  pOne thing I noticed when the game was lagging while starting up is that you can actually move the window, and it will stay where you put it. Digging more into Windows 7 I found out I can force the window menu with SHIFT  Right Click and confirmed that the window can indeed move around.p  pI grabbed the Win32 API calls codeSetWindowPoscode and implemented my C code to follow a window. This works for other applications like uTorrent, Calc, and all other regular apps I have tried. However, it does emnotem work for LA Noire. I have tried toggling the flags on codeSetWindowPoscode, such as the one that says dont deliver it to the codeWndProccode, not showingmoving it, not resizing, etc.p  pI also tried other variants of codeSetWindowPoscode like codeMoveWindowcode, which didnt help move LA Noire but still worked with Calc etc.p  pWhats the next logical step Should I send codeWMMOVEcode manually to the process or should I install a hook on the windowp

Negative 984 pI am having a discussion with a fellow developer about a problem we have with a webapp on iOS devices. It makes heavy use of events and jQuery. We currently have the problem that the app runs slow after being used for a certain amount of time.p  pMy colleague suggests that the problem is that we bind event handlers on specific elements, e.g.p  precodedivid123.onclick, function........ codepre  pAnd, because we do this whenever we load new elements into the DOM, those event handlers eventually pollute the browser, making it slower.p  pAs soon as a new element is loaded, the old ones are codedivid456.removecoded from the DOM entirely, until they may be loaded again completely new, no caching of any sort.p  pI cannot disprove him, but I am very sure that as soon as the old elements are removed, the event handlers are removed by the browser, too. After all why should he keep themp  pHe suggest I rewrite all the handlers to have the form ofp  precodedocument.onclick, div.commonclass, function....... codepre  pto have the event handlers on document level, bound to the classes all the elements we deal with have in common.p  pThis would mean some major rewriting for me which Id like to avoid for something that, in my opinion, is not the root cause of our problem.p  pIs my assumption about events on removed elements correct and if so, how can I show my colleague that rewriting the event handlers is unnecessarily wasted work timep

Negative 984 pIm new to ExtJs and I am trying to get a sense of what are the best practices. p  pI noticed that if I want to access a store in the controller, I should use the method getMyStoreNameStorep  pBut what if I have two stores of the same type for example, they are both myStore. How would I distinguish one from the other The getter method the constructor provides seems like it would not be account for this.  p  pA similar question could be said for views. I know you are suppose to use coderefscode and designate a codeselectorcode, but what if I have two instances of a class in the same view e.g. my viewport. How do I designate one of them Or is that what the purpose of codequerycode isp
Negative 984 pI have that algorithm that checks for a cities around a city I choose within 50 km. It uses latitude and longitude, but I dont know if it checks right the cities, because I have a database with a lot of cities from Australia and their lat and long and I dont know if my code is working the right way.

In real world, I have a SQL file with a lot of scripts, and I want to make sure all the scripts maintain in a transaction, so I want to wrap it in an outside transaction.p  pThat code above is not working. Its printing inside done, and then throws an exception. This print could be a big insertion.p  pWhats going on How do I solve itp
Negative 984 pI am doing an analysis in Stata and I have a lot of different panel regressions within, firstdifference and random trend and to see the results properly, I am using codeeststocode and codeesttabcode.p  pMy problem now is that to get the difference for first difference and the double difference for the random trend, I use coded.codevarname and coded.d.codevarname. Stata then thinks that the differences are new variables and puts them in their own rows which becomes very difficult to read.p  pHas anyone an idea how I can get a regression table in which Stata sees varname, coded.codevarname and coded.d.codevarname as the same variablep  pMy regression looks like thisp  precode foreach v in a aa aaa aaaa  qui eststo xtreg v b b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 i.year, fe clusterxy  qui eststo xtreg v b b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 i.year if cgtd, fe clusterxy  qui eststo reg d.v d.b d.b1 d.b2 d.b3 d.b4 d.b5 i.year, clusterxy  qui eststo reg d.v d.b d.b1 d.b2 d.b3 d.b4 d.b5 i.year if cgtd, clusterxy  qui eststo reg d.d.v d.d.b d.d.b1 d.d.b2 d.d.b3 d.d.b4 d.d.b5 i.year, clusterxy  qui eststo reg d.d.v d.d.b d.d.b1 d.d.b2 d.d.b3 d.d.b4 d.d.b5 i.year if cgtd, clusterxy  esttab using output.tex, wide   codepre  pIn my table I then get my estimates for p  precode b  b1  b2  b3  b4  b5  d.b1  d.d.b1  d.b2  d.d.b2  and so on.. codepre
Negative 984 pI am trying to rebuild an Android BLE App in iOS where the BLE Central is working as both Client and Server.br At first the local device is scanning for a BLE device, discovers it and connects to it. Client role Then the local device takes over the Server Role and notifies the BLE device if any Characteristic values are changed.p  pIn Android it works fine because I can use the discovered BluetoothDevice and via the codeBluetoothDevice.connectGattcode method make it subscribe to my characteristic changes. When changing the value I use the codenotifyCharacteristicChangedcode method to notify the device.p  pI guess the most important difference is that in iOS after device discovery, I only get a codeCBPeripheralcode as a discovered device, which I cannot use for any Clientbased functions such as subscribing to a Server. At least, thats what I couldnt figure out so far.p  pI read this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20655068ioscorebluetoothcentralserverandperipheralclientiOs CoreBluetooth Central Server and Peripheral Clienta thread and the linked mailing list discussion a hrefhttplists.apple.comarchivesbluetoothdev2013Novmsg00047.html relnofollowhttplists.apple.comarchivesbluetoothdev2013Novmsg00047.htmla about iOS devices acting as Client and Servers and theoretically it should be possible and I was wondering if someone found a way to make a discovered remote device subscribe to my Characteristic changes.p

Negative 984 pBackground Im writing a program that creates generative art. I care about creating one final static image, and I dont need to render a bunch of frames per second. So far its been 2D, and Im on a Mac so Ive been using the Core Graphics aka Quartz 2D drawing API. Ive reached its limits so I started messing with OpenGL, but Im not happy with the antialiasing so far.  p  pIm wondering if I should invest in learning it, or whether its not built for what I want.  Is OpenGL more about creating moving graphics as fast as possible, mainly for games If I want the highest quality rendering high resolution, smooth curves, best antialiasing, arbitrary lighting and shading algorithms do I need to write my own renderer, or does it make sense to learn OpenGL  Will I be able to use it as a base  p

Negative 984 pI am trying to develop an EAPTLS client, using OpenSSL, raw sockets and C. I received a response from the server FreeRADIUS with a serverhello message. I now need to isolate the server certificates, serverkeyexchange and certificaterequest from the message. I currently have the packet in an uint8t char[] array. Do I use the SSLgetpeercertificatessl function I figured I need to associate the earlier ssl context with the new packet. How do I go about this Thank youp

Negative 984 pIve been implementing ZeroClipboard into an application and Ive hit a snag getting mouse events to register.

The SWF file is being found successfully and the codereadycode, codebeforecopycode, codecopycode, and codeaftercopycode events work beautifully. I see all the expected console logging.p  pstrongHoweverstrong  when I try to implement the supported mouse interaction events, I get nowhere. Ive tried the following with no successp  precodeclient.on mouseenter, event gt   console.logMouseOver              client.on mouseover, event gt   console.logMouseOver              client.on mousedown, event gt   console.logMouseOver codepre  pI cant get as much as a console.log out of any of these events. There are no other JS errors and by all appearances ZeroClipboard is working quite well.p  pIve unsuccessfully tried adding an event listener like sop  precodeclient.addEventListener mouseover, event gt   console.logHoverState codepre  pIt doesnt appear that it will work because the client is a ZeroClipboard object and addEventListener is not a member function of its class.p  pI did venture into the ZeroClipboard.js file and add some console.log statements where the mouseover event should be firing, and they output successfully. Thus I can mostly rule out that its an issue in ZeroClipboards event implementation and conclude that its almost definitely something wrong with my code, though after spending the better part of the afternoon sleuthing I have come up empty handed in regards to a viable solution.p  pIf somebody could please lend a hand I would be most appreciative  thanks in advancep

Im using composer to install dependencies so I can perhaps add the SimpleSAML folder to the class tree  not tried this yet. Or should I use the SimpleSAMLphp autoload filep  psimplesamlphpcomposer I sees there is an option install with composer So, if so, it will go within my application folder and files. However, Ive tried this and not sure how to get composer to pick up the SimpleSAML classes. Anyone had much use of this method I tried doing composer dumpautoload but it didnt add them. I guess I need to do more.p  pCan anyone give me some advice on how to use simpleSAMLphp with ZF1. Even just a point in the correct direction regarding where best to put files. We want to role this installation out to all our websites eventually so something that is easy to setup would be best I guess. I do like the composer approach but didnt have much luck with it. Previously the project used CAS with a phpCAS client  that was installed using composer which was quite convenient.p  pAny help would be much appreciated, thanksp

Negative 984 pI understand that developers are able to overload codeoperator[]code to either get or set something depending on which side the operator is on.

Negative 984 pSomething I have been struggling with for a while, but Im not able to come up with a proper solution.p  pThis is the situation  p  pHost 1  IBM HTTP Server, Customization Toolbox and WAS Pluginsbr Host 2  WAS  Application  p  pThese are the steps I executed to configure the plugin and propagate it from Webspherebr 1. I used the Customization Toolbox, selected the correct WAS Plugins directory and created a new Web Server Pluginbr 2. I copied the new configureSERVER.bat to my Application Server on Host 2, and configured the current profile.br 3. On Host 1, I created an Administrator account.  p  pWhen I open the WASconsole on Host 2, I can see the actual Web Server, so that went ok.  When I select Generate plugin and Propagate Plugin, I get no errors.  I checked the HTTP Server, and indeed, my plugincfg.xml is neatly created and exists.p  pTo make sure everything is all right, I opened the codehttpHOST1snoopcode on Host 1 and I saw the correct diagnostics.  So far, so good.p  pAfter that, I deployed my application, which runs on port 9044.  However, this application runs on HTTPS, so we need to make sure that the IBM HTTP Server accepts SSL connections.  I generated my own selfsigned certificate, imported it in the httpd.conf and restarted the server.  If someone is interested, Ill put some more details on how to do this.p  pNow, when I open codehttpsHOST1snoopcode I can see the diagnostics, which is good news.  It means it accepts connections on https and reroutes it to Host 2. But the problem is, I have no idea how to access my application, which is running on port 9044.p  pSomething that puzzles me is the details when I run the snoopservlet.p  pWhen I run it via http so without SSL, this is the outputp  pLocal address   XXX.XXX.XXX.XXXbr Local host  XXXXXXXXXXbr Local port  9080  p  pThat is correct, because the port on Websphere is 9080 for that particular servlet.  However, when I open codehttpsHOST1snoopcode so, via SSL, this is what being generatedp  pLocal address   XXX.XXX.XXX.XXXbr Local host  XXXXXXXXXXbr Local port  9044  p  pSo, apparently, 443 is being rerouted to 9044 on the second host, but the Snoop servlet runs on 9443, not 9044 which is my application.  But, then I wonder, why can I access the servlet, if it is running on another port.p  pSo, if theres anyone who can give me some guidance, that would be nice.  p  pThis is the VHOSTp  precodeltVirtualHostGroup Namedefaulthostgt     ltVirtualHost Name9080gt     ltVirtualHost Name80gt     ltVirtualHost Name9443gt     ltVirtualHost Name5060gt     ltVirtualHost Name5061gt     ltVirtualHost Name443gt     ltVirtualHost Name9044gt ltVirtualHostGroupgt codepre

Negative 984 pIt used to work like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkwRSY.jpg altcorrect appearancep  pBut then, a developer working with our company made a bunch of changes to make the navbar and status bar the same color in iOS 7, changing the style of the status bar.

Negative 984 pI recently created a script to create a Dragon Curve, and managed to optimize the code quite a bit.  Basically, i start by generating a list of rules, looking something like code[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]code, where 1 represents a right turn, and 1 represents a left turn. This goes very fast with numpy arrays.p  pMore on the dragon curve a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDragoncurve relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDragoncurveap  pHowever, now i want to create a curve in the plane using this list. Basically pick a point x, y, and a direction east, walk one step, and turn 90 degrees right or left depending on the current element in the list, which we loop over. We also take an extra step at the end, but that shouldnt matter to the question.p  pLets say that our starting position is 100, 100, we start going east, and the list is code[1, 1, 1]code. Then we should get code[100, 100, 101, 100, 101, 101, 101, 101, 100, 101, 100, 102]code, which gives us the second iteration of the dragon curve. p  pCurrently Im using the following code to generate the sequence of pointsp  precodepos  [100, 100] ang  math.pi2 for i in dragon  [0]     pos.extend[pos[2]math.cosang, pos[1]math.sinang]     ang  imath.pi2 codepre  pwhere codedragoncode is the previously generated list, e.g. code[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]code. I add [0] to take an extra step at the end. For 19 iterations my script outputsp  precodearray of length 1048575 completed in 0.00567 seconds dragon created in 2.82039 seconds dragon drawn in 0.01462 seconds image saved in 0.01229 seconds codepre  pWe can clearly see that the code above is the most timecomsuming. Is there a faster way to generate all these points from the list we previously generatedp

Negative 984 pIf a userclient attempts to access a system using a valid username and invalid password, current security guidelines require that the response for such a request match the response returned for a login attempt where both the username and password are invalid. Thusp  ul liValid username amp invalid password  response  Invalid UserPasswordli liInvalid username amp invalid password  response  Invalid UserPasswordli ul  pThe underlying premise being that all failed logins should return the same response to prevent malicious login attempts from deriving useful information about a system based on the response.p  pWhen I briefly worked for a web security firm, a coworker was developing a dynamic bruteforce login system that would harvest valid usernames and then make more sophisticated attacks once it had a valid username list. I asked how it could discern which usernames were valid vs invalid if the response was consistent, and the trick is to monitor the delta response times between several login requests.p  pIn other words, even though the response is consistent, the response times might not be, so that a request with a valid username and invalid password might take longer to process than an invalid username.p  pMy question, then, is whether there is a reliable soundpopularindustryadopted methodframework that reduces the risk of responsetime hacks, either at the application layer so for a webapp at the php or similar serverside level or at the slightlylower server layer so for a webapp or web service, at the apachehttpd levelp  pIm specifically curious because one of the applications that I develop for offers multiple authentication methods, including local authentication and thirdparty such as LDAPAD authentication, and it seems like it would either significantly increase login times or significantly increase invalid login responses if some deadline were imposed that either aborted the login attempt before a remote authentication server could be reached or held the response based on the potentially higher turnaround time for remote authentication even when the extra time isnt required at the moment.  Is there some dynamic realtime system that shifts a deadline based on current average response time Would shifting the deadline undermine the security goalp

Negative 984 pIm planning a D3.js application that will display a network graph i.e. display nodes and edgesnot a line plot or barchart, etc..  Only some nodes and edges need to be displayed at any given moment, and the attributes of nodes and edges will change, tooall in response to user interaction.  So far, so goodI know that d3.js can do this sort of thing, as illustrated by the a hrefhttpmbostock.github.iod3talk20111116forcecollapsible.html relnofollowforcecollapsible examplea and the a hrefhttpbost.ocks.orgmikenations relnofollowhealth and wealth of nations examplea.  It would be simplest to keep all of the data in a single JSON or XML object.p  pIm worried that if my application loads all of the data needed for all parts of the network at any time, Ill overwhelm the users system.  A typical network will have 35000 nodes, with attributes that vary at up to 5000 timesteps.  This is about 4GB in a GEXF format XML file with unnecessary whitespace removed.p  pIs there a way to request only part of a JSON or XML object, i.e. only those parts of the tree that I need a given time  Or will I have to do something more complicated Any pointers to options to investigate will be appreciated.p  pThis might be FAQ, but its one of those things thats difficult to search on.p

Negative 984 pSo I have searched for hours on a solution to this and have attempted using filters with no success.

Negative 984 pI think I understand the concept of HMVC after reading this question and answer a hrefhttpprogrammers.stackexchange.comquestions220480hmvcanddatabaseconnectionshttpprogrammers.stackexchange.comquestions220480hmvcanddatabaseconnectionsa an extract from an answer is belowp  blockquote   pLets assume you want to have a view that enables a user to make a   comment to a blog post. You would have fields for name, email, title   and comment, but you also want to have a field country displayed as a   dropdown. In the action that displays this view you would make a   database query that loads the countries and then populate that   dropdown. Which is ok, but it forces you to duplicate the query and   the view required to display the countries if you need it in another   part of your application. A better approach would be to create   separate controller for countries with an action that returns a view   with the dropdown and then render that action whenever you need to   show a list of countries.p blockquote  pWhat I cannot wrap my head around is that if I can internally request a controllermodelview which just displays a widget e.g. a country select box, doesnt that mean that by accessing that url from a browser will also just show that viewp  pHow is this managed in HMVC, are routes defined as internalexternal only, so matching an internal route with an external request would show a 404 pagep  pIs this generally how it is done and is the HMVC descriptiondefinition above satisfiable with the general use case of it in most web applicationsp

All copies of codeLevelcode that are created share that codecountdowncode closure, because it is in the prototype chain. When a user quits the level early, and then starts a new level trashing the old codeLevelcode object instantiating a new codeLevelcode object, the codeelapsedcode variable in the closure is not reset.p  pTo say it in another way, the user quits the level early with 30 seconds left. Then the user starts the level again, but now, instead of a full 2 minutes, the countdown timer is still showing 30 seconds.p  pIs there an elegant way to fix this and still use a closure Or must I revert to my previous solution, forget closures, and make codeelapsedcode a member variablep

Negative 984 pI know this sounds like every other question on the net about this but its actually not. I have tried finding the right answer high and low so as to not waste anyones time but to no avail. I should also add that I am pretty new to MVC.NET.p  pI have an MVC 4 view with a DropDownListFor call that throws a null ref exception on post. I am trying to test a submit with nothing selected scenario i.e. the default selection is selected. Ideally, it will get picked up and yell at me with a required field message. I see that the Province model property is in fact set to 1 on the post, so that works. p  pNow this is where my question deviates from most others. I am pretty sure that the model is being passed correctly and that the SelectList is populated. I have set a breakpoint on the line in the view and am seeing it populated on the post just before it blows up. My code seems to look like every other example I have seen.p  pI very much appreciate any help you can provide.p  pAt the end, I will paste the yellow screen info.p  pSo here are the snippets, I cut out the bulk of it so youre not overwhelmed with nonrelevant codep  pViewp  precodeusing GymManagement.UI.Models model UserModel Html.DropDownListForm gt m.Province, Model.ProvinceList, new idProvincePersonal, classinputField, valueModel.Province codepre  pControllerp  precodepublic ActionResult CreateMember      return CreateUser   [HttpPost] public ActionResult CreateMemberUserModel model      return CreateUsermodel   private ActionResult CreateUser      var model  new UserModel      PrepareModelmodel, false      return Viewmodel   private ActionResult CreateUserUserModel model      if ModelState.IsValid              return DisplayUsermodel           PrepareModelmodel, true      return Viewmodel   private void PrepareModelUserModel model, bool isPostback       other items removed for brevity      if Session[Provinces]  null  ListltProvincegtSession[Provinces].Count  0              var serviceClient  ServiceProxy.GetLookupService         var provinces  serviceClient.GetProvinces  Returns ListltProvincegt          provinces  provinces.OrderByp gt p.ProvinceName.ToList         Session[Provinces]  provinces         model.Provinces  provinces          else              model.Provinces  ListltProvincegtSession[Provinces]       codepre  pModelp  precode base model public class BaseModel      public BaseModel              Provinces  new ListltProvincegt          public ListltProvincegt Provinces  get set      user model public int Province  get set   public IEnumerableltSelectListItemgt ProvinceList      get              var list  new SelectListProvinces, ProvinceId, ProvinceName         var defaultItem  Enumerable.Repeatnew SelectListItem                      Value  1,             Text  Select province         , count 1          defaultItem  defaultItem.Concatlist          if Province  0                      var selectedItem  Province.ToString             var province  defaultItem.Firstp gt p.Value.EqualsselectedItem             province.Selected  true                   return defaultItem       codepre  pObject reference not set to an instance of an object.p  pStack Tracep  blockquote   p[NullReferenceException Object reference not set to an instance of an object.]      ASP.PageViewsuserCreateMembercshtml.Execute in cUsersMikedocumentsvisual studio 2012ProjectsGymManagementGymManagement.UIViewsUserCreateMember.cshtml46      System.Web.WebPages.WebPageBase.ExecutePageHierarchy 279      System.Web.Mvc.WebViewPage.ExecutePageHierarchy 124      System.Web.WebPages.WebPageBase.ExecutePageHierarchyWebPageContext pageContext, TextWriter writer, WebPageRenderingBase startPage 180      System.Web.Mvc.ViewResultBase.ExecuteResultControllerContext context 379      System.Web.Mvc.ltcDisplayClass1a.b17 32      System.Web.Mvc.ControllerActionInvoker.InvokeActionResultFilterIResultFilter filter, ResultExecutingContext preContext, Funccode1 continuation 613      System.Web.Mvc.ControllerActionInvoker.InvokeActionResultWithFiltersControllerContext controllerContext, IListcode1 filters, ActionResult actionResult 263      System.Web.Mvc.Async.ltcDisplayClass25.b22IAsyncResult asyncResult 240      System.Web.Mvc.ltcDisplayClass1d.b18IAsyncResult asyncResult 28      System.Web.Mvc.Async.ltcDisplayClass4.b3IAsyncResult ar 15      System.Web.Mvc.Controller.EndExecuteCoreIAsyncResult asyncResult 53      System.Web.Mvc.Async.ltcDisplayClass4.b3IAsyncResult ar 15      System.Web.Mvc.ltcDisplayClass8.b3IAsyncResult asyncResult 42      System.Web.Mvc.Async.ltcDisplayClass4.b3IAsyncResult ar 15      System.Web.CallHandlerExecutionStep.System.Web.HttpApplication.IExecutionStep.Execute 606      System.Web.HttpApplication.ExecuteStepIExecutionStep step, Booleanamp completedSynchronously 288p blockquote

Negative 984 pIm working on a rails project that is connected to a thirdparty MySQL database strongthat I cannot change the schema forstrong.  So far, Ive been able to shoehorn everything into rails and make it play nice, but Ive come across an interesting problem.p  pI have a table, well call it codefooscode.  I have an ActiveRecord model called codeFoocode that uses this table.  The problem is that this table represents two similar but distinct types of record.  Well call them Foo type A and Foo type B.  To get around this, Ive created two classes, codeFooTypeAcode and codeFooTypeBcode that inherit from codeFoocode and have default scopes so that they only contain records of their respective types.p  pMy code looks something like thisp  precodeclass Foo lt ActiveRecordBase    methods common to both types end  class FooTypeA lt Foo   defaultscope gt  where istypea true     methods for type A end  class FooTypeB lt Foo   defaultscope gt  where istypea false     methods for type B end codepre  pFor the most part, this works pretty well, except for the fact that sometimes an association chain joins over both of these models.  Since they come from the same table, this causes ambiguity problems, and generates exploding SQL queries.  Ive been writing custom join queries to get around this, but its quickly becoming cumbersome.p  pI know I can change the default table name for a model with the codeself.tablenamecode value, but is there a way that I can tell rails to change the FROM portion of the SQL query for a model so that I can make all queries from FooTypeA read as codeSELECT fooas. FROM foos AS fooas ...codep  pIm open to other suggestions, but this seems like the easiest solution if its possible.p

I know it sounds easy but I cant get around how to do this properly in SQL  Im not exactly a prodigy.p  h1My Bad Solution no its really bad...h1  pMy solution right now is to fill a temporary table with all the required data and codeUNION ALLcodeing the data I needp  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecode Before Im building this SQL I retrieve the relevant groups  for being able to build the UNION ALLs at the bottom.  I also retrieve the thingies that are relevant in this context  beforehand and include their ids as a comma separated list   I said it would be awfull ...   Creating the temp table holding all stats data rows  for a thingy in a specific group CREATE TABLE stats id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY1,1,  groupid INT NOT NULL,  thingyid INT NOT NULL,  value FLOAT NOT NULL,  somedate DATETIME NOT NULL   Filling the temp table INSERT INTO statsgroupid,thingyid,value,somedate SELECT filtered.groupid, filtered.thingyid, filtered.somedate, filtered.value FROM    SELECT joined.groupid,joined.thingyid,joined.value,joined.somedate     FROM        SELECT groups.groupid,data.value,data.thingyid,data.somedate         FROM              Getting the groups associated with the contexts              of all the stats available            SELECT DISTINCT context.groupid             FROM allstats AS stat             INNER JOIN groupcontexts AS groupcontext                 ON groupcontext.contextid  stat.contextid          AS groups         INNER JOIN              Joining the available groups with the actual              stat data of the group for a thingy            SELECT context.groupid,stat.value,stat.somedate,stat.thingyid             FROM allstats AS stat             INNER JOIN groupcontexts AS groupcontext                 ON groupcontext.contextid  stat.contextid             WHERE stat.value IS NOT NULL               AND stat.value gt 0 AS data         ON data.groupid  groups.groupid AS joined      AS filtered  I already have the thingies beforehand but if it would be possible  to includequery for them in another way thatd be OK by me WHERE filtered.thingyid in  somewhere around 10000 thingies are available    Now Im building the UNION ALLs for each thingy as well as  the group the stat of the thingy belongs to   thingy 42   Getting the average of the most recent 3 stat items  for a thingy with id 42 in group 982 SELECT x.groupid,x.thingyid,AVGx.value FROM    SELECT TOP 3 s.groupid,s.thingyid,s.value,s.somedate     FROM stats AS s     WHERE s.groupid  982       AND s.thingyid  42     ORDER BY s.somedate DESC AS x GROUP BY x.groupid,x.thingyid HAVING COUNT gt 3  UNION ALL   Getting the average of the most recent 3 stat items  for a thingy with id 42 in group 314159 SELECT x.groupid,x.thingyid,AVGx.value FROM    SELECT TOP 3 s.groupid,s.thingyid,s.value,s.somedate     FROM stats AS s     WHERE s.groupid  314159       AND s.thingyid  42     ORDER BY s.somedate DESC AS x GROUP BY x.groupid,x.thingyid HAVING COUNT gt 3    UNION ALL   thingy 21   Getting the average of the most recent 3 stat items  for a thingy with id 21 in group 982  you get the idea  codepre  pThis works  slowly, but it works  for small sets of data e.g. say 100 thingies that have 10 stats attached each but the problem domain it has to eventually work is in 10000 thingies with potentially hundreds of stats per thingy. As a side note the generated SQL query is ridiculously large a pretty small query involves say 350 thingies that have data in 3 context groups and its amounting to more than 250 000 formatted lines of SQL  executing in a stunning 5 minutes.p  pSo if anyone has an idea how to solve this I really, really would appreciate your help .p

Negative 984 pIm manipulating divs with javascript all the time.p  pSometimes I need to make those divs fit inside a container whos size is contantly changing.p  pOne way to make that happen is to use css scaling. The problem with scaling is that it simply schrinks the picture of the element. The system continues to see the element the same way. So all location etc. become skewed. For instance, if I position the div to become top0, then if the element has been scaled down it will not go to zero percent but a bit below that, because the system thinks the div is bigger than its visuals show.p  pThis change in behavior causes a lot of complications as the system is now making assumptions about the elements that simply dont hold true.  Its bad programming.p  pI looked at the zoom but the articles warned against using it.p  pIs there any way to scale elements and also keep the system updated on whats actually going onp

Negative 984 pso my 4th column on my datagridview is Sort Order.  A valid input is a whole number.  But a user can leave that cell blanknull as well.  I give an error message if a cell value is invalid.  However, with what I have, I get the message if I leave it blank.  That should be valid.  So I did a try parse on an int value, which covers the integer criteria.  For the null criteria, I tried converting the value to a string and check to see if its empty.

Negative 984 pI am using Processing in Java to perpetually draw a line graph.  This requires a clearing rectangle to draw over drawn lines to make room for the new part of the graph.  Everything works fine, but when I call a method, the clearing stops working as it did before.  Basically the clearing works by drawing a rectangle in front of where the line is currently atp  pBelow are the two main methods involved.  The drawGraph function works fine until I call the redrawGraph which redraws the graph based on the zoom.

It instead returns to the getData function and completes all the questions before going into the function and getting the answers. This causes all the questions to be printed out and then all the answers. I want it to be a question followed by its answer and so on. I have tried getting rid of the extra functions and putting everything into one function but it still didnt work and made the code hard to read.

I understand that perhaps I need to create my own namespace dictionary Either way, here is my situationp  pI am getting a result from an API call, it gives me an XML that is stored as a string in my Python application. p  pWhat Im trying to accomplish is just grab this XML, swap out a tiny value The bstring value user ConditionValueDefault but thats irrelevant to this question and then save it as a string to send later on in a Rest POST call.p  pThe source XML looks like thisp  precodeltContext xmlnshttpTest.the.Sdk201007 xmlnsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstancegt ltxmlns iniltrue xmlnshttpschema.test.org200407Test.Soa.Vocab xmlnsahttpschema.test.org200407System.Xml.Serializegt ltConditions xmlnsahttpschema.test.org200407Test.Soa.Vocabgt     ltaConditiongt         ltaxmlns iniltrue xmlnsbhttpschema.test.org200407System.Xml.Serializegt         ltIdentifiergta23aacaf9b6b424f92bb5ab71505e3bcltIdentifiergt         ltNamegtCodeltNamegt         ltParameterSelectionsgt         ltParameterSetCollectionsgt         ltParametersgt         ltSummary iniltruegt         ltInstancegt25486d6c36ba4ab29fa60dbafbcf0389ltInstancegt         ltConditionValuegt             ltComplexValue iniltruegt             ltText iniltrue xmlnsbhttpschemas.microsoft.com200310SerializationArraysgt             ltDefaultgt                 ltComplexValue iniltruegt                 ltText xmlnsbhttpschemas.microsoft.com200310SerializationArraysgt                     ltbstringgtNULLCODEltbstringgt                 ltTextgt             ltDefaultgt         ltConditionValuegt         ltTypeCodegtStringltTypeCodegt     ltaConditiongt     ltaConditiongt         ltaxmlns iniltrue xmlnsbhttpschema.test.org200407System.Xml.Serializegt         ltIdentifiergt0af860f656114a2396dceb3863975529ltIdentifiergt         ltNamegtContent TypeltNamegt         ltParameterSelectionsgt         ltParameterSetCollectionsgt         ltParametersgt         ltSummary iniltruegt         ltInstancegt6364ec20306a4cabaabc8ec65c0903c9ltInstancegt         ltConditionValuegt             ltComplexValue iniltruegt             ltText iniltrue xmlnsbhttpschemas.microsoft.com200310SerializationArraysgt             ltDefaultgt                 ltComplexValue iniltruegt                 ltText xmlnsbhttpschemas.microsoft.com200310SerializationArraysgt                     ltbstringgtStandardltbstringgt                 ltTextgt             ltDefaultgt         ltConditionValuegt         ltTypeCodegtStringltTypeCodegt     ltaConditiongt ltConditionsgt codepre  pp  pMy job is to swap out one of the values, retaining the entire structure of the source, and use this to submit a POST later on in the application. p  pThe problem that I am having is that when it saves to a string or to a file, it totally messes up the namespacesp  precodeltns0Context xmlnsns0httpTest.the.Sdk201007 xmlnsns1httpschema.test.org200407Test.Soa.Vocab xmlnsns3httpschemas.microsoft.com200310SerializationArrays xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstancegt ltns1xmlns xsiniltrue gt ltns0Conditionsgt ltns1Conditiongt ltns1xmlns xsiniltrue gt ltns0Identifiergta23aacaf9b6b424f92bb5ab71505e3bcltns0Identifiergt ltns0NamegtCodeltns0Namegt ltns0ParameterSelections gt ltns0ParameterSetCollections gt ltns0Parameters gt ltns0Summary xsiniltrue gt ltns0Instancegt25486d6c36ba4ab29fa60dbafbcf0389ltns0Instancegt ltns0ConditionValuegt ltns0ComplexValue xsiniltrue gt ltns0Text xsiniltrue gt ltns0Defaultgt ltns0ComplexValue xsiniltrue gt ltns0Textgt ltns3stringgtNULLCODEltns3stringgt ltns0Textgt ltns0Defaultgt ltns0ConditionValuegt ltns0TypeCodegtStringltns0TypeCodegt ltns1Conditiongt ltns1Conditiongt ltns1xmlns xsiniltrue gt ltns0Identifiergt0af860f656114a2396dceb3863975529ltns0Identifiergt ltns0NamegtContent Typeltns0Namegt ltns0ParameterSelections gt ltns0ParameterSetCollections gt ltns0Parameters gt ltns0Summary xsiniltrue gt ltns0Instancegt6364ec20306a4cabaabc8ec65c0903c9ltns0Instancegt ltns0ConditionValuegt ltns0ComplexValue xsiniltrue gt ltns0Text xsiniltrue gt ltns0Defaultgt ltns0ComplexValue xsiniltrue gt ltns0Textgt ltns3stringgtStandardltns3stringgt ltns0Textgt ltns0Defaultgt ltns0ConditionValuegt ltns0TypeCodegtStringltns0TypeCodegt ltns1Conditiongt ltns0Conditionsgt codepre  pIve narrowed the code down to the most basic form and Im still getting the same results so its not anything to do with how Im manipulating the file normallyp  precodeimport xml.etree.ElementTree as ET import requests  getcontextxml  httplocalhosttestapireturnxml returns first XML example above. sourcecontextxml  requests.getgetcontextxml  Tree  ET.fromstringsourcecontextxml  Ensure the original namespaces are intact. for Conditions in Tree.iterhttpschema.test.org200407Test.Soa.VocabCondition      print success  with openhomememyselfoutput.xml,w as f     f.writeET.tostringTree codepre

Negative 984 pI use the following code in Matlab to create a figure consisting of 3 subplots. Each subplot is a heatmap.

Negative 984 pI am developing a lightweight graphics API for different needs where I want to render the image before it gets displayed. I have overriden the AWTs Component in order to have the highest perfomance. However, if I render the image draw lines, rectangles amp stuff in the codepaintcode method the process of painting becomes visible to the user if the method is being called frequently e.g. the window is being resized, or an animation is being played, and it is quite a perfomanceheavy solution.p  pI decided to cache and render the image separatly and simply copy the pixels to the Graphics object in the codepaintcode method. But now I dont know how to draw a single pixel to the Graphics object. I suppose the underlaying Sun implementation has such method but I should not address that class. I know that Graphics class declares several methods codedrawLinecode, codedrawRectcode, codefillRectcode, etc. that seem lightweight and can be used to only paint one pixel but I dont know which one will be the quickest.p  pI do not want to use BufferedImage due to some memory issues and thus codedrawImagecode is not a solution in this case. It is also not the case asked in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13638793whatisthefastestwaytodrawpixelsinjavathis questiona because, again, I do not use Images and I do not create new instances in the codepaintcode method the rendered image data class only changes when the component is resized.p  pstrongtldrstrong the quickest method in java.awt.Graphics to set the color of some pixel by its coordinates to a specified color java.awt.Color or RGB, last preferred.p  pThank you in advance.p

To start with, I got stuck with a simple task tiling a backgroundp  pSince Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.ImageBrush do not support tiling, I wanted to to do that manually. Some sites suggest making numerous number of children, each holding a tile. Honestly, it looks as a rather awkward approach to me, so I decided to do it in what appears a more natural way create an offscreen tiled image, assign it to a brush and assign the brush as the background for a panel.p  pThe tiling code is rather straightforward it probably has mistakes, possibly wont even not run on a phone, because of some unavailable classes used. p  precodeint panelWidth  int contentPanel.Width int panelHeight  int contentPanel.Height  Bitmap bmpOffscreen  new BitmappanelWidth, panelHeight  Graphics gOffscreen  Graphics.FromImagebmpOffscreen  string bmpPath  Path.CombineWindows.ApplicationModel.Package.Current.InstalledLocation.Path, Assetsjustatile.png  System.Drawing.Image tile  System.Drawing.Image.FromFilebmpPath,  true  int tileWidth  tile.Width  int tileHeight  tile.Height   for int y  0 y lt panelHeight y  tileHeight      for int x  0 x lt panelWidth x  tileWidth          gOffscreen.DrawImagetile, x, y codepre  pNow I presumably have the tiled image in bmpOffscreen. But how assign it to a brush To do that I need to convert Bitmap to BitmapSource, while I couldnt find something similar to System.Windows.Imaging.CreateBitmapSourceFromHBitmap available for WPF structurep
