My concern is while the emunderlyingem integral type used to represent the numeric range of the individual enumerators is perfectly capable of representing code0code as a value, that 0 value does not map to the constants themselves. Its this differentiation that is confusing the integral type range vs the range of the enumerations enumerators. codetcodes value seems to be well defined from the perspective of an codeintcode, but it is not well defined in the sense that as a scalar, it does not map to one of the enums constants.p  pMy searching resulted in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27935026thebehaviorofvalueinitializinganenumthis SO posta, however the top answer was emveryem technical and I didnt quite understand. Im posing the question here from a slightly different angle, to see if I can get an answer that makes a little more sense to me.p  pAre there different rules andor guarantees between enums with fixed value enumerators vs those without them The code above makes perfect sense for enums with enumerators that have not been explicitly assigned, its the fixed value case that is confusing.p

Positive 1078 pI want to be able to map each value of an codeEnumcode to a different codeclasscode and the reverse, but keep the relationships stored in a single place so they can be alteredadded to without making changes in multiple location.p  pstrongWhat pattern would allow me map Enum values to Classesstrongp  pMy specific usage is roughly as followsp  pI have a codePersoncode class that holds general information about the person. To this class can be added components stored in a scodeListcodes codeDictionarycode that hold information specific to a particular type of person, eg. codecomponentCustomercode, codecomponentEndUsercode, codecomponentSuppliercode. These componentclasses implement an codeIPersonComponentcode interface. Importantly, ema person can be more than one type and can therefore hold more than one componentem.p  pI also have an Enum codeePersonTypecode with values eg. Customer, End User, Supplier. Each value has a onetoone relationship with a component.p  pWhen a persons record is retrieved, a codeListltintgtcode is populated with the appropriate ePersonType values. This list is then used to determine what components need to be allocated to the codePersoncode and loaded with data.p  pClearly, it is straightforward to codeswitchcode on the persons types and add components appropriately. However, what if I later want to check what components the person instance holds and what codeePersonTypecodes they are I could codeswitchcode back on codecomponent.GetTypecode, but then I am storing the relationship in two places.p  pAlternatively, I could store the appropriate codeePersonTypecode inside each component and use Linq to check whether an person instance has a particular component, but then it seems like the original allocation would be more complex, possibly requiring reflectionp  pI feel sure that Im missing something really obvious here.p

Is there a way to do this, or am I stuck using ifelse logic Id rather not as there are 20 enums and the switch is much cleaner lookingp  pEDIT Yes, I know that I can just pick one or the other and no locales are not the solution, but doesnt it seem kind of odd that enums explicitly allow you to declare duplicate values yet you then cant use them in a switch statement I want to use enums so that I can statically enforce in a library API that they are sending proper values yes I know you can get around with typecasting, Im just trying to prevent stupid mistakes and such. If I do so it now seems like I lose the ability to use it in a switch statement.  p  pThe compiler is just reducing the logic down to ifelse logic.

Negative 1078 pI have an application that uses Hibernate to connect to my MySQL database. Im just having a weird problem with timeouts. Lets say that the socket timeout in MySQLs configurations is set to one hour. After an hour of inactivity, the socket times out as expected. The problem is that Hibernate doesnt seem to be able to handle the socket timeout, because when Hibernate tries to make a database query, a SocketException is thrown. Instead of handling the exception internally, hibernate just dies and cannot recover from the exception in any other way than for me to manually build a new SessionFactory.p  pThe question is, how can I avoid this problem so that I do not have to manually keep track of timeoutsp  pEDIT Your suggestions seem to be the right way to go, but for some reason Im not able to get it to work.

Negative 1078 pIm in a bit of a pickle at work. My department designs a number of internal systems for the company, mostly datareporting related. We have less than 10 true content pages that actually need to be maintained by a human. These pages were written in PHP and maintained through Dreamweaver by a nontechnical staff members  they used the design editor, and avoided the code as much as possible. There were issues, but overall it worked well.p  pRecently this project was updated and converted to a ASP.NET Web Application. This resulted in some architecture changes, making the content harder to edit with a WYSIWIG editor its now revision controlled, its compiled and thus must be redeployed after modifications are made, etc.. We sort of assumed that the staff member who had been maintaining it would just continue to do so, now using Visual Studios Design mode instead of Dreamweavers. We were mistaken, and it isnt an option for technical and nontechnical reasons.p  pThe staff member will not be touching emanyem HTML  we need a WYSIWIG editor this is a requirement we were handed...no arguing with them over that. I started looking at CMS, mainly Drupal, but after a bit of playing around I see that content Blocks dont really have a WYSIWIG editor, instead expecting HTML. Is this true for all CMS Is there some easytosetup CMS out there that comes with a WYSIWIG editor Does anyone have any other ideas Dont care what language its in, Ill make something work.p  pThis really isnt my area of expertise  I do application development primarily, with an occasional web frontend. Not sure Im even asking the right question, but hoping someone can help.p
Negative 1078 pYou all know how to build AJAX sites with those 300ms trigger for checking anchors hash links in URL and then loading proper page with AJAX. But, these anchor links are nothing to search engines p  pIve thought of making some kind of workaround. All JS code remains the same, but, this little thing Im with JQuery, sorryp  precodea.liveclick,function var lnk  this.attrhref     document.location.hash  lnk     return false  codepre  pAnd then, you replace your anchor links in the body with plain links, build corresponding plain pages still containing all JS codes for nonjavascript users and search engines. For normal visitors you would have plain links converted into hashes on fly and AJAX content loaded immediately. For those who are trying to load certain pages found through search engine  they will, and after that visitor will continue to move around with ajax navigation... somehow remember, those plain direct pages still contain JS code.p  pI just want to make sure my assumptions are right.

Negative 1078 pI am not entirely sure how to word this questions so I am just going to explain my problem.p  pMy VB 6 program saves the location of the screen in the registry so that when it loads up again it can have a default location. This works as expected, but I encountered a problem. I had a computer setup with 2 monitors. I dragged the window to the second screen, then the next day when I unplugged the second monitor. Every time I would load the program it would appear in the dock, but the form itself was not.p  pI figured it was hiding on the second monitors space or were the second monitor should be Now at first I connected a second monitor to grab it back, but it did not show up. The monitor setup was such that the main monitor 1 was to the left of the new monitor 2. I had to drag 2 over to the left of 1 at which point it showed up, and I was able do drag it back to the main window and everything worked fine. I mention this because I figured each monitor numbers resolution was relative to itself. Is the multimonitor one giant coordinate planep  pWhat I want to know is when I grab the location numbers from the registry Form.left and Form.top is there a way to check it against what is available to the system This is not a huge issue, but I know I am going to get clients calling in eventually asking, Its loading, but I cant find it and would like to avoid those calls if possible.p  pThank you allp

Negative 1078 pWe are wanting to replace our current update system for the POS software at our stores.  Currently, we have a folder on our webserver that hosts a script that our registers call every 30 minutes or so.  They pass in their current version number, and the server returns an XML response containing any files that need to be updated, hash, and any other pertinent information for the register to download the updated files.p  pWe want a service that will listen for UDP packets that we send out that we can use to trigger an update.  This will keep the registers from unnecessarily polling for updates.  We are writing an update server that will listen for a TCP connection from a machine, authenticate, do some logging, and then send along updates for the files that have changed.  We want to move to a custom update server, because we have the need to release versions of the POS to certain machines for a trial run after testing before releasing it companywide.p  pIve written the code to handle incoming connections and create a new thread to handle communicating with that client, etc, but I am having a hard time with handling file IO in a multithreaded manner.p  pIm pretty sure I wont be able to just access a file by opening it from one thread if its already open in another.  I dont want to read the files into memory and keep them in a threadsafe container beforehand, since that would use a lot of memory, especially if it turns out I need to keep a copy for each thread in order to avoid threading issues.p  pWhat would be the best way to go about being able to access these files from diskmemory in a threadsafe manner without using a lot of memory or causing threads to wait on other threads to finish with the filesp  pEDIT Forgot to mention we are using C.p

I think basically when the SQL is done, the connection closed message appears. So basically, nothing gets into memcached for this entry. Again, this worked with locmem.p  pAny thoughtsp  pThanks.p

Negative 1078 pWe have a clickonce WinForms application that is using the Report Viewer 2010. The assemblies are privately deployed  that is, we do not GAC them AFAIK, this is the best practice, although I might be wrong.p  pWe are running into the following problem. We require Report Viewer file version 10.0.40219.1 I believe this is from VS2010 SP1  it has some bug fixes that the RTM version 10.0.30319.1 does not have. However, one some machines we deploy to, the bad older assembly is already in the GAC for example, if the user has installed VS2010 RTM or any other software that decides to GAC the Report Viewer  TFS does that, I believe. Unfortunately, the assembly version of both assemblies is the same, 10.0.0.0. Because of this, the CLR loader ALWAYS picks the GAC assembly over the locally deployed one.p  pAs far as I understand, all Assembly.Load methods will load from the GAC first, no matter what, so preloading the assembly manually wont really help us. The only solution I can see is to GAC the ReportViewer assembly we are deploying  but that does not sound like the right thing to do.p  pQuestion what is the proper way for us to ensure the correct Report Viewer assembly gets loadedp  pThanks,p  pDave.p

Negative 1078 pFollowing on from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq7108895326820thisa question, I understand that Visual Studio 2008 doesnt accurately render Designs made on Expression Blend. The additional problem I have is, the View of the Window doesnt match with the Design shown on Blend. I am using Expression Blend 2.0, and Visual Studio 2008.NET 3.5. Could this have something to do with itp  pThe design is very simple, just some buttons placed next to each other. I understand without the XAML code, it would be difficult to address the exact problem, I just want to know the strategy to tackle such difference.p

Negative 1078 pI designed a GUI using GridBagLayout and GridBagConstraints.  It contains a variable number of rows, each with one of a few possible column layouts.  To test the code, I comprised the GUI of panels with different colors that illustrate the location and resizing behavior of all the cells in each row and column.  This test GUI works fine, but now I need to automate its construction.  Specifically, I need the rows to be one of three different types.  If you run the code below and look at the resulting GUI, you can see that row1 is one type, rows 2,6,and7 are another type, and rows 3,4,and5 are yet a third type.  I need each of these three types of rows to be encapsulated in its own class.  Whats more, I need my code to be able to create a variable number of rows of the third type illustrated by rows 3,4,and5 in the example.  This is for data analysis software.  The panels will load data views and tools for manipulating the data views.p  pWhen I try to encapsulate the rows into their own classes, the GUI stops looking like it should look.  The test code below generates a GUI layout the way that it should look.  Can anyone show me how to alter this code so that it has the functionality described in the first paragraph abovep  pYou can just paste my test code below into your IDE to get it working right away.

Negative 1078 pI am having some Accoustic Echo Cancellation experiments for a VoIP application and sound drives me mad. What I am trying to do is simple I had recorded a sound before. Now I will play that sound and while playing, record another sound, which is the real case for a full duplex VoIP scenario. I use MedaiPlayer for playing sound and MediaRecorder for recording new sound. Below is the full code of the class, modified from Android SoundRecorder Sample. The important points are,      mPlayer.setAudioStreamTypeAudioManager.MODEINCOMMUNICATION for Android docs say In communication audio mode. An audiovideo chat or VoIP call is established. and     mRecorder.setAudioSourceMediaRecorder.AudioSource.VOICECOMMUNICATION for Android docs say Microphone audio source tuned for voice communications such as VoIP. It will for instance take advantage of echo cancellation or automatic gain control if available. It otherwise behaves like DEFAULT if no voice processing is applied. and this is so promising.  But if I play anything coming out from speakers, I record almost nothing or only weird noises. I cant attach sound waves of recordings as I am a new user here, but the first one is a normal recording, which has normal sound waves. Second recording is the recording while playing the first one, which contains almost nothing, no sound waves. Android seems to turn mic off if there is any activity in speaker. I tried different possibilities for MediaRecorder and MediaPlayer, but no use. What is the correct way of implementing Accoustic Echo Cancellation in Android I tried on Sony Tablet S and developed using Android 3.0 SDK.

Negative 1078 pI am working on a project in which I have a model that is used by several different views and thereby viewcontrollers. These viewcontrollers have no knowledge of each others existence, nor do they have any relationship to each other. This means that I have a model in each of the viewcontrollers and when the views are loaded, I allocate the model in each class and make the pointers point at it. Or short I allocate my model n times in n classes that use it, which I think is a waste of memory not that I will run out of memory, but I think its bad practice.p  pIs there a way in iOS where I while still maintaining good MVC practice am able to create and use the same instance of my model Usually I have been programming in c where I would pass a reference to the model to the constructor of each class that should know the model. Example cp  precode Let to classes know of the same model object MyModel model ControllerA myControllerAampmodel ControllerB myControllerBampmodel codepre  pInstead I do the following in each class that use my model objectivecp  precode ControllerA model  [[MyModel alloc] init]   Controller B model  [[MyModel alloc] init] codepre  pI dont want to make all models singleton objects and in this specific project I think using an observer pattern would be an overkill.p  pSo, my question is How can i achieve this and is it even possiblep

Negative 1078 pMy C CAD application maintains logs of the users modeling operations so that they can be unapplied and reapplied.  Any particular project may contain just a few operations or it may contain hundreds of thousands of operations.  I already have my own data structures in place to manage this data in a way that is memoryefficient, and this has been working well.  But now I am adding a feature that allows the user to inspect his operation logs in a grid.  I am using Embarcadero RAD Studio 2010 all GUIs use VCL.p  pCurrently, I am using a TDBGrid component to show the user the operation data in rows.  Here is how I have my components connected upp  blockquote   pTDBGrid.DataSource  a TDataSource  p      pTDataSource.DataSet  a TClientDataSetp      pTClientDataSet.ProviderName  a TDataSetProviderp      pTDataSetProvider.DataSet  a ProjectDataSet p      pA ProjectDataSet is a class I derived from TDataSet.p blockquote  pBecause I am pulling the operation data from my own data structures and not from a database, I have overridden the GetFieldData and GetRecord functions and several others in my ProjectDataSet class so that it returns the data directly from my own data structures without doing any database queries.  This works.p  pIn order to minimize memory usage when displaying lots of operations, I have set the FetchOnDemand property in my TClientDataSet and I have set PacketRecords to 100.  So, initially only the first 100 operations appear in the grid.  Once the user scrolls to the bottom of the grid, the next 100 operations are automatically fetched by the TClientDataSet and displayed in the grid.p  pAll of this works very well.  My problem is that as the user scrolls through the grid, the TClientDataSet keeps on fetching more and more records without ever releasing any.  So, if the user scrolls down far enough in a very large project, I eventually run out of memory.p  pSo, my question is what is the best way to make this GUI work  Essentially, I want the grid to behave like a spreadsheet.  I want the user to be able to scroll up and down through the operation list or jump to a specific row, regardless of how many operations there are, and I dont want the GUI components keeping a lot of stuff in memory that the user doesnt imminently need.  p  pIm assuming that the TDBGrid or some other VCL component is designed to be capable of displaying arbitrarily large datasets by fetching only a few records at a time, so how is it meant to be donep  pIf I need to rethink the GUI, thats fine.  But it would be really nice if I could use the same GUI to display 10operation projects or 100,000operation projects.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1078 h1Edith1  pstrongMake sure you dont juxtapose the request and response objects.  things will be easier if you dont.strong  p  pI am trying to POST data from a form with two inputs to a specific url node responds to. Originally I was using the javascript xmlHTTPrequest object to send it.  The data was received but node could never read the object I tried sending which was JSON format.  Here is what it looked like when I converted it to a stringp  precode output [],    outputEncodings [],   writable true,   last false,   chunkedEncoding false,   shouldKeepAlive true,   useChunkedEncodingByDefault true,   hasBody true,   trailer ,   finished false,   socket      handle         writeQueueSize 0,         socket [Circular],         onread [Function onread] ,      pendingWriteReqs 0,      flags 0,      connectQueueSize 0,      destroyed false,      errorEmitted false,      bytesRead 8442,      bytesWritten 1669569,      allowHalfOpen true,      writable true,      readable true, codepre  pThis was not the full string.  I switched over to use an ajax post request instead because I thought serializearray might create a different format that node could read but it was the same.  My server side code is essentially justp  precodefunction emailrequest, response   form     request.setEncodingutf8   request.ondata, functionchunk      console.logdata received     form  chunk.toString       request.onend, function      console.logdone receiving post data    codepre  pMy form looks like thisp  precode  ltform nameemail actionjavascripttruegt     ltinput typetext nameaddress valueEnter your email address onFocusthis.valuegt     ltinput classspecial typetext namehoneypotgt     ltinput typesubmit valuesubmitgt   ltformgt codepre  pIf I try parsing with JSON.parse, there is an error caused by unexpected obr If I try parsing with querystring, it returns an empty objectbr If I try something like console.logform.address the output is undefined but should be one of the values i submitted in the form.p  pmy http server would route to email and this is the function that responds to email.p  pI checked and I know the on data event has not expired because my code is set up to notify me of a dataevent and I can see the event happening.  Locally, this code works fine and I can read the data submitted but on the development server it just doesnt work.p  pI know people will say I should be using connect or express but lets just suppose that was not an option, how could I get node to correctly process this data  The jquery that submits the form is more or less standard.  Many thanksp  h2EDITh2  pSorry, I thought the problem would be fixed as I noticed immediately the posted string was not JSON.  Here is the code I am using to send the post.p  precodedocument.readyfunction    email.submitfunctionevent    event.preventDefault   var data  this.serializeArray   .ajax     type POST,     dataType json,     url email,     data JSON.stringifydata,     success functionmsg      aviso.htmlmsg                codepre  pHere is the string the data variable holdsp  precode[        name address,     value foobar.com   ,        name honeypot,     value irobot    ] codepre  pThis is valid JSON as per jsonlint.  But still the same error when it reaches the server.  Node handles the data event and all is well until I try to parse the string, it causes an error undefined1 unexpected o. p

Negative 1078 pSpeaking of server resources in general and background processes. Would it be better to use a separate executable and a windows scheduled task or use the timer class and make use of the same resources as you application.p  pThere are a few pros and cons to both methods, but what Im wondering is this Would making use of shared resources thread pools and the like be better than separate resources Sure the process would be taking resources from the app, but isnt it technically already doing that either wayp

Negative 1078 pIm using the silverlight toolkit animation in all my pages. It works fine in classic page, panorama page and when closing a pivot.p  pBut when Im navigating to a pivot control, I often find that the animation doesnt start at all, especially on an average device like the HTC Trophy. Its a better on a good phone like the Lumia 800, but the animation does not trigger every time.p  pIs there a known bug with the pivot control that delays the initialization and causes the animation to be cancelled  I cant understand why the animation is so erratic, and why it works from time to time. In the People app, for example, when you click on a contact, the pivot always shows the animation. I would like to be able to reproduce this behavior. p  pFYI, I put this code in the xaml files p  precodelttoolkitTransitionService.NavigationInTransitiongt   lttoolkitNavigationInTransitiongt     lttoolkitNavigationInTransition.Backwardgt       lttoolkitTurnstileTransition         ModeBackwardIn gt     lttoolkitNavigationInTransition.Backwardgt     lttoolkitNavigationInTransition.Forwardgt       lttoolkitTurnstileTransition         ModeForwardIn gt     lttoolkitNavigationInTransition.Forwardgt   lttoolkitNavigationInTransitiongt lttoolkitTransitionService.NavigationInTransitiongt lttoolkitTransitionService.NavigationOutTransitiongt   lttoolkitNavigationOutTransitiongt     lttoolkitNavigationOutTransition.Backwardgt       lttoolkitTurnstileTransition         ModeBackwardOut gt     lttoolkitNavigationOutTransition.Backwardgt     lttoolkitNavigationOutTransition.Forwardgt       lttoolkitTurnstileTransition         ModeForwardOut gt     lttoolkitNavigationOutTransition.Forwardgt   lttoolkitNavigationOutTransitiongt lttoolkitTransitionService.NavigationOutTransitiongt codepre  pAny clue would help.

Negative 1078 pWell I read a hrefhttpwww.alexandregomes.comp418 relnofollowthisa article, however the scope bar just shows instantly, no animation.p
Negative 1078 pI have a page with a jqueryui datepicker control. On each day selection, I post with ajax to a web method to do some server side data population to fill the drop down box which is beneath the calendar control.p  pI used this code for two pages already, first works perfect, but am having issues with this one. The first time I select a date, the event fires fine, second time nothing happens, then the next click works fine again. So the event only fires on every second click, be it the same date or a different date. I added an  input control to capture date selection, which works fine on each select.p  pWhat bugs me now is, If I add an alert inside my select jquery function, it fires every time, take it out and I have this issue again.p  pThanksp  pMarkupp  precodelt Page LanguageC AutoEventWireuptrue MasterPageFileSite.Master CodeBehindcalendartest.aspx.cs  InheritsTest.calendartest EnableEventValidationfalse

Negative 1078 pIm a Java developer whos toyed around with Python on and off. I recently stumbled upon a hrefhttpdirtsimple.org200412pythonisnotjava.htmlthis articlea which mentions common mistakes Java programmers make when they pick up Python. The first one caught my eyep  blockquote   pA static method in Java does not translate to a Python classmethod. Oh sure, it results in more or less the same effect, but the goal of a classmethod is actually to do something thats usually not even possible in Java like inheriting a nondefault constructor. The idiomatic translation of a Java static method is usually a modulelevel function, not a classmethod or staticmethod. And static final fields should translate to modulelevel constants.p      pThis isnt much of a performance issue, but a Python programmer who has to work with Javaidiom code like this will be rather irritated by typing Foo.Foo.someMethod when it should just be Foo.someFunction. But do note that calling a classmethod involves an additional memory allocation that calling a staticmethod or function does not.p      pOh, and all those Foo.Bar.Baz attribute chains dont come for free, either. In Java, those dotted names are looked up by the compiler, so at runtime it really doesnt matter how many of them you have. In Python, the lookups occur at runtime, so each dot counts. Remember that in Python, Flat is better than nested, although its more related to Readability counts and Simple is better than complex, than to being about performance.p blockquote  pI found this a bit strange because the documentation for a hrefhttpdocs.python.orgpy3klibraryfunctions.htmlstaticmethodstaticmethoda saysp  blockquote   pStatic methods in Python are similar to those found in Java or C. Also see classmethod for a variant that is useful for creating alternate class constructors.p blockquote  pEven more puzzling is that this codep  precodeclass A     def foox         printx A.foo5 codepre  pFails as expected in Python 2.7.3 but works fine in 3.2.3 although you cant call the method on an instance of A, only on the class.p  pSo theres three ways to implement static methods four if you count using classmethod, each with subtle differences, one of them seemingly undocumented.

Negative 1078 pWhat Im trying to accomplish is a simple questions and answer page. In this example Im going to use capital cities and major cities.p  pI am displaying a list, with a question and answer. I need both to be searchable. So far this seems to be working fine. As a question is typed, for example, What is the capital... it will start to display relevant questions. When it is completed, What is the capital of the United Kingdom, it will filter the correct list item and hide the rest.p  pWhat I could do with accomplishing is making the search a lot less strict, if that makes sense. So for example, at the moment, if someone searches What is the capital of United Kingdom note that the the is missing, the relevant question and answer will not display. Now, I wondered if regular expressions or stemming might be appropriate. But I dont want it to just ignore words like the. Id like it to strip it down completely and be more of a wild card search. Being specific in this case is not important.p  pSo, for example, if I have a question and answer already stored like, Q What is the capital of Canada A Ottawa, Ontario is the capital of Canada. But someone asks, Is Toronto Canadas capital Because capital and Canada have been mentioned, Id like the answer most relevant to return.p  pHopefully this all makes sense.

Negative 1078 pFolks,p  pWe have a web site that uses PayPal Express Checkout for Digital Goods to make software sales. It has been working fine for 5 months. Last week we started getting an error The request was aborted Could not create SSLTLS secure channel. off the live site. When I run the site off my development server it runs fine and we can process a transaction. All these are against the  live paypal site. In looking at many questions on this forum and others the main problem appears to be using the wrong endpoints. I am using the .NET SDK and the nvp methods. I checked the endpoints and they are the current ones provided by paypal for nvp transactions. Even looked in the dll to make sure we didt have an older version. We are good there.p  pThen I thought it might be that the hosting server couldd establish a secure link to paypal so created a test page with a url with query string to the endpoint likea hrefhttpsapi3t.paypal.comnvpUSERXXXXapi1.XXX.comampPWDXXXampSIGNATUREXXXXXXampVERSION60.0ampPAYMENTACTIONAuthorizationampAMT1.95ampRETURNURLhttpswww.paypal.comampCANCELURLhttpswww.paypal.comampMETHODSetExpressCheckout relnofollowhttpsapi3t.paypal.comnvpUSERXXXXapi1.XXX.comampPWDXXXampSIGNATUREXXXXXXampVERSION60.0ampPAYMENTACTIONAuthorizationampAMT1.95ampRETURNURLhttpswww.paypal.comampCANCELURLhttpswww.paypal.comampMETHODSetExpressCheckouta. p  pThis worked and returned the expected transaction token. So we can connect from the hosting server. Then thinking our credentials or credential retrieval code might be the problem I pulled the credentials out of our database and ran the test as follows. p  pTest Query string with server data codep  pThis worked so credentials and endpoint are good on the hosting server.p  precode    Dim sCEnvironment As String    System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.AppSettingsEnvironment     Dim dtsettings As DataTable     dtsettings  Dac.ExecuteDataTableGetCredentials, Dac.ParameterEnvironment, sCEnvironment       Set up your API credentials, PayPal end point, API operation and version.

See code below. As each line is generated I added to it a string that writes out to the test page so I can get an idea what is going on our hosting server.  We use the express checkout for Digital Goods process. I got the basic code from a hrefhttpscms.paypal.comcmscontentFRfrFRfilesdevelopernvpDoAuthorizationcs.txt relnofollowhttpscms.paypal.comcmscontentFRfrFRfilesdevelopernvpDoAuthorizationcs.txta and added the Digital Goods query parameters per the online documentation.  This works on my development server and returns the Token.

The query string is generated by the encoder and held in the variable pStrrequestforNvp so the encoder works. p  pI am at a loss.

Negative 1078 pIn attempting to set up Eclipse with PHPUnit as a unit testing library, Ive gotten myself stuck attempting to run a simple test case.

Negative 1078 pIm not sure whether this behavior is expected i.e. Im misusing Reactive.Banana.Switch or a bug.p  pLets say I have two liketyped input Behaviors, and I want to switch between them based on an Event.

Two text entry fields for the Behaviors, a button emitting alternate True and False Events, and a label bound to the combined Behavior using codesinkcode.p  pHowever, after triggering the Event several times, it becomes obvious that theres a catastropic leak somewhere.  The app starts taking longer and longer to react both to changes in the input Behaviors and to new Events.  It also starts eating memory.  p  pHeres a heap profile with hC img srchttpi.imgur.comco4BMir.png altleaking memory Im repeatedly toggling the Event the two largest spikes are maybe the twentieth and twentyfirst firings of the Event.p  pThe use of trimB feels a bit like handwaving to make the types add up I dont know whether Im using it correctly or abusing it somehow.p  pMy subquestions are p  p1 Am I abusing the Reactive.Banana.Switch API, or is this a bug  If I am abusing the API, what am I doing wrongp  p2 Should I do this without using dynamic event switching  Using codeapplycode doesnt give the correct behavior, because the resulting Event doesnt fire when the underlying Behavior changes.  If I unwrap all three inputs to Events, I imagine I can set up a fold, manually accumulating the most recent value of each input Event.  Is that the correct approachp

Or it is better to say I dont know which method in Jlist class changes the datalist in Jlist.  I just need a clue.  Sorry if my question is not professional, I am very new at java and programing.  Thanks p

Negative 1078 pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comv2IKA.png altenter image description hereI have a storyboard that looks like the attached image.p  pThe idea is that there are three portrait views, showing current consumption, through which the user can navigate by swiping left. Im using left swipe gesture recognisers for this. Then I add right swipe gesture recognisers and connect then to an unwind segue to go back. This works fine.p  pThe order is [both electricity amp gas]  [electricity]  [gas].p  pEach portrait view has a corresponding landscape detail view. These are also set up so that the user can navigate by swiping, and I unwind the segues so that they can swipe back. Again the order is [both graph]  [electricity graph]  [gas graph].p  pI also want the user to be able to move from any portrait view to its corresponding detail view by rotating the device. I spot the rotation in each of the portrait controllers, and programmatically perform the segue, like so for gas. Note the code isnt robust against the correct orientation yet, while Im just experimenting.p  precode voidwillRotateToInterfaceOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationaToInterfaceOrientation durationNSTimeIntervalaDuration       [self performSegueWithIdentifier SegueGasToLandscape senderself]   codepre  pSo, for example, the user might swipe twice to view the gas portrait page, and then rotate the device to see the detailed graph of gas consumption.p  pFrom here, Id like the user to be able to swipe right to see the electricity detail graph, and then right again to the graph for both  but this wont happen, as the method for doing this is to unwind a swipe that has not happened. And in fact the landscape electricity view controller is not even instantiated at this point.p  pWhat I think I need is not to use unwind segues, but instead to use normal segues throughout. However I want to do this without creating new instantiations for existing controllers as unwind segues do but to create a new instantiation if needed as unwind segues dont.p  pIf it matters, Im happy to code for iOS 6.1 and above.p  pHas anyone done thisp

Negative 1078 pI am running SocketIO on NodeJS and I dont care much about wide browsers support as its my pet project where I want to use all the power of new technologies to ease the development. My concern is about how I should send large amounts of JSON data from server to client and back. Well, these amounts are not as large as could be for video or image binary data, I suppose not larger than hundreds of kilobytes per request.p  pTwo scenarios I see arep  ol liSend a notification via WebSockets from server to client that some data should be fetched. Then client code runs a regular XHR request to server and gets some data via XHR.li liSend the whole data set over WebSockets from server to client. In this case I dont need to run any additional requests  I just get all the data via WebSockets.li ol  pI saw first case in Meteor.js, so I wondered the reasons of it. Please share your opinion.p

Negative 1078 plets say we have a class with some methods in it, of which at least one is of rather complex naturep  precodeclass Example      public function Example                private function complexFunctionvoid              Do this         And do that         And of course do that         and do not forget that           private function otherImportantFunctionvoid              Do something           [...]  codepre  pNow complexFunction has grown pretty long and also a little complicated. So a nice thing to do to increase readability would be to split up complexFunction in smaller subfunctions. I usually do it like thisp  precodeclass Example      public function Example                private function complexFunctionvoid              doThis         doThat         andOfCourseDoThat         andDoNotForgetThat           private function doThisvoid              Do This           private function doThatvoid              Do That           private function andOfCourseDoThatvoid              And of course do that           private function andDoNotForgetThatvoid              And do not forget that           private function otherImportantFunctionvoid              Do something           [...]  codepre  pBut by now the class is already drowning in minor functions whose sole purpose is to get called once inside complexFunction. Do this splittingup a little more often and it becomes hard to spot the important methods between all those helperfunctions.p  pAt least this is what happens to me all the time and clarity really suffers for it. That makes me wonder if you know a way to solve that dilemma Surely there is way or best practice to handle this Im dreaming of a way to group functions together, or to subordinate the minor ones to the superior ones, without creating a whole new class for that purpose. Or is that how its donep

Negative 1078 pWhen a SQL Server CLR UDT is set to a value, that value as a string is internally passed to the codeParsecode method, which is supposed to return an instance of the UDT set to whatever the passedin string value translates to according to that types logic.

Knowing that ISBNs are either nine digits followed by one check digit, or 978 followed by nine digits followed by one check digit, it is easy to define the business rules for what constitutes a valid ISBN. A business requirement is that only valid ISBNs should ever be handled by the system  anything invalid should immediately raise an error and the system was not previously built for this it used to allow anything unique and nonNULL into the ISBN field, which is now being tightened down. If someone inputs a string that is not a valid ISBN, then what is the appropriate action to take in Parsep  pI tried throwing an codeArgumentExceptioncode but this wreaks havoc with other parts of the database logic and eventually brings the application to a grinding halt because of an unhandled codeTransaction count after EXECUTE indicates a mismatching number of BEGIN and COMMIT statements.code error.

Negative 1078 pI have an emenvironmentem list which keeps associations between variables and values, such as codeenv  [x, 1, y, 2, z, 3, ...]code. I also have another emsubstitutionem list which is returned by a pattern matching control function that keeps associations between variables and pattern, such as codes  [v, Varp z, w, Varp v, u, Varp w, ...]code. Lets consider the first pair codev, Varp zcode my function should check the value corresponding to codezcodein the environment, create a new association between codevcode and codezcodes value i. e. codev, 3code and put it into the environment. My code for this function is the following.p  precodefun augmentenv [], e  env  e    augmentenv s  srest, e  env       let         val a, b  s      in         case b of            Constp i gt []  augmentenvwithvars srest, e           Varp x gt             if exists e, x then a, lookup e, x  augmentenvwithvars srest, e      end codepre  pHere, codescode is the substitution list and codeexistscode and codelookupcode are functions which check the existence of a variable in the environment and look for the corresponding value, respectively. The problem with this function is that works fine only for direct associations in the example, it puts the direct association between codevcode and code3code into the environment. It obviously doesnt work for the transitive associations unless I call it multiple times which I dont know in advance how many they are. To recall the example, by the end of this function, my environment list should be codeenv  [x, 1, y, 2, z, 3, v, 3, w, 3, u, 3, ...]code.p  pCould you please give me a hint about how to modify this function to work fine with the transitive associations, toop  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1078 pFrom this a hrefhttpocw.mit.educoursesaeronauticsandastronautics1601unifiedengineeringiiiiiiivfall2005spring2006compsprogrammingnumbersystems.pdf relnofollowMIT handout on number systemap  blockquote   pDecimal subtraction works very similar to decimal addition, the   numbers are aligned to  the same place values and the algorithm   proceeds from right to left. The bottom digit is  subtracted from the   top digit, and the result written in the place value position in the    result. If the top digit is less than the bottom digit, then we must   borrow from the next  place value position. That means decrementing   the top digit in the next significant  position and adding the base to   the top digit of this position before performing the  subtraction.   This operation gets even more complicated when there is a 0 in the   next significant position.p blockquote  pWhat confuses me is the second last line in the paragraph. Can someone please explain the meaning of decrementing  the top digit in the next significant  position emand adding the base to  the top digit of this position before performing the  subtractionem.p

Negative 1078 pI have a Swing GUI challenge that I have distilled to the following SSCCE.  The issue is that the JTreeJScrollPane jumps around in a disturbing manner when updating the JLabel at the bottom of the window to reflect the selected node.  p  pThe best way to see this behavior is to run the SSCCE, click in the JTree, and hold your keyboards downarrow to rapidly to traverse the JTree.  The GUI flickers as if the JLabel is being removed and then added again.  This isnt really the case, though  Im just updating the JLabels text.  p  pId like to control the redrawing of the GUI so that it isnt so jarring.  I need to retain the word wrapping and dynamic height of the status bar  using a fixed height component would solve the jumping, but defeats the design idea.p  pIve tried several different approaches to updating the status bar area one of the approaches you can see commented out in the SSCCEs TreeSelectionListener, but everything Ive tried either results in improper recalculation of the height or flickering.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3vzCm.png altenter image description herep  precodeimport java.awt.  import javax.swing. import javax.swing.event. import javax.swing.tree.  public class JTreePlusStatus extends JFrame      JPanel contentPane     JScrollPane jScrollPane     JTree jTree     JLabel jLabelDescription     GridBagConstraints gbcJLabelDescription      public static void mainString[] args          EventQueue.invokeLaternew Runnable              public void run                  try                      String sysLaf  UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName                     UIManager.setLookAndFeelsysLaf                     JFrame frame  new JTreePlusStatus                     frame.setSize300, 300                     frame.setLocationRelativeTonull                     frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE                     frame.setVisibletrue                  catch Exception e                      e.printStackTrace                                                  public JTreePlusStatus          initComponents         initCustom           void initComponents           Boilerplate layout busywork         contentPane  new JPanel         GridBagLayout gblContentPane  new GridBagLayout         contentPane.setLayoutgblContentPane         setContentPanecontentPane          jScrollPane  new JScrollPane         GridBagConstraints gbcJScrollPane  new GridBagConstraints         gbcJScrollPane.fill  GridBagConstraints.BOTH         gbcJScrollPane.weighty  1.0         gbcJScrollPane.weightx  1.0         gbcJScrollPane.gridx  0         gbcJScrollPane.gridy  0         contentPane.addjScrollPane, gbcJScrollPane          jTree  new JTree         jScrollPane.setViewportViewjTree         jTree.addTreeSelectionListenernew TreeSelectionListenerImpl          jLabelDescription  new JLabel          gbcJLabelDescription  new GridBagConstraints         gbcJLabelDescription.fill  GridBagConstraints.HORIZONTAL         gbcJLabelDescription.gridx  0         gbcJLabelDescription.gridy  1         contentPane.addjLabelDescription, gbcJLabelDescription           void initCustom           Set sample data onto the JTree         jTree.setModelcreateSampleModel           Expand entire tree         for int i  0 i lt jTree.getRowCount i              jTree.expandRowi                    public DefaultTreeModel createSampleModel          DefaultMutableTreeNode top  new DefaultMutableTreeNodeMusic         for int i  0 i lt 100 i              String s  Classical  Concertos  Beethoven                        S No. 5  EFlat Major   i             top.addnew DefaultMutableTreeNodes                  DefaultTreeModel defaultTreeModel  new DefaultTreeModeltop         return defaultTreeModel           class TreeSelectionListenerImpl implements TreeSelectionListener           public void valueChangedTreeSelectionEvent e              TreePath selectionPath  jTree.getSelectionPath             String s  selectionPath.getLastPathComponent.toString             String newText  lthtmlgtltbgtNameltbgt   s                        ltbrgtltbgtDescription ltbgt  s  lthtmlgt               Tried this  causes the JTree to jump around              jLabelDescription.setTextnewText                             OK, try making a new JLabel and set it into the parent,               hoping that there wont be an intermediate state where labels               space in the GUI collapses temporarily                           final JLabel newJLabel  new JLabelnewText             final Container parent  jLabelDescription.getParent             parent.addnewJLabel, gbcJLabelDescription, 1             parent.removejLabelDescription             if parent instanceof JComponent                  JComponent jc  JComponent parent                 jc.validate  must revalidate after adding or removing                          jLabelDescription  newJLabel               No luck, JTreeJScrollPane still jumps around                codepre

Negative 1078 pI have a subnavigation menu on my page that opens up whenever codenreviewcode is appended to the URL.p  pI also have languages changing and session variables being set whenever codelanguagexxcode is appended.p  pHowever, if I am on a page with the subnav open, and I wish to change language from there, the codenreviewcode is replaced with codelanguagexxcode upon link click, and therfore the subnav closes. strongHow would I check to see if a codeGETcode  variable is already set every time the language is changed, and if so, append my additional one to the endstrongp  pOnce the language has been changed, the new language is set to a session variable so I do not need to worry about keeping its codeGETcode variable.

Negative 1078 pWhats the most efficient way to handle transparency when working with vertex data Im using OpenGL ES 2.0 as well as GLKit. The user has access to a codeUISlidercode control that determines what the alpha value should be for each vertex in the model values 0 to 1. Currently, I have to cycle through each vertex in the model and modify the alpha level on the color coordinates in a for loop. This is incredibly inefficient and slows down processing. Is there another way to handle dynamic transparency for models using vertex dataVBOs I dont believe GLKit has any builtin ways to handle this using materials or effects either. Correct me if Im wrong, please.p

Negative 1078 pThis is hard to explain but ill try my best. I have a Table View controller that leads to 10 View controller. All the View controllers have a navigation bar title The titles are the 10 objects from the Table view controller. Now i want to add the Swipe Gesture for a easier navigation between the 10 table view items Instead of going back to the Table view manually i want the user to be able to swipe to change from a view controller to another. HERES THE PROBLEM When i add the Swipe Gesture and i connect it from one view to another, it asks if i want the action to be either Push, Modal or custom. Now, if i choose one of them, it makes the navigation bar title disappear. I want to keep the title without messing up the connection from the table view to the views controller. Thanks.p

Those instances are distinct but codeEqualscode since they the have same targets.p  pcodea1code and codea2code are the same as codeinstance1code and codeinstance2code, but because of the contravariance of codeActionltin Tgtcode there exist emimplicitem reference conversions from codeActionltobjectgtcode to each of codeActionltstringgtcode and codeActionltSystem.Urigtcode.p  pNow, the C Language Specification has among other overloads these codeoperator codep  precodebool operator object x, object y                    7.10.6 bool operator System.Delegate x, System.Delegate y  7.10.8 codepre  pThe current Visual C compiler realizes the first one by simply checking if the references are the same the IL does not actually call a mscorlib method like codeobject.ReferenceEqualscode, but that would give the same result, while it realizes the second one by calling a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.delegate.opequality.aspxcodeDelegate.opEqualitycode methoda which looks like a userdefined operator inside that assembly even when it is defined by the C Language Spec, so is maybe not userdefined in the sense of the spec.p  pNote that 7.10.8 is a little confusing because it says emEvery delegate type implicitly provides the following predefined comparison operator[s]em and then gives the operator with the codeSystem.Delegate, System.Delegatecode signature. That is just emoneem operator, not one for every delegate type This seems important for my question.p  pIt is not surprising that the three first codeWriteLinecode write codeFalsecode, codeTruecode and codeTruecode, respectively, given what I said above.p  pemstrongQuestionemstrong But why does the fourth codeWriteLinecode lead to the codeobject, objectcode overload being usedp  pThere does exist an implicit reference conversion from codeActionltgtcode or any other delegate type to codeSystem.Delegatecode, so why cant that be used here Overload resolution should prefer that over the codeobject, objectcode option.p  pOf course, there are no emimplicitem conversions between codeActionltstringgtcode and codeActionltUrigtcode, but why is that relevant If I create my own class codeMyBaseClasscode containing a userdefined codeoperator MyBaseClass x, MyBaseClass ycode and I create two unrelated deriving classes, then my codecode operator will still be used left and right operand not convertible to each other but both convertible to codeMyBaseClasscode.p  hr  pJust for completeness, here is the analogous example with strongcovariancestrong codeFuncltout TResultgtcode instead of contravariancep  precodestatic class ProgramF      static string TargetMethod              return dummy           static void Main              Funcltstringgt instance1  TargetMethod         Funcltstringgt instance2  TargetMethod          FuncltICloneablegt f1  instance1         FuncltIConvertiblegt f2  instance2          Console.WriteLineobjectf1  objectf2         Console.WriteLineDelegatef1  Delegatef2         Console.WriteLineFuncltstringgtf1  Funcltstringgtf2          Console.WriteLinef1  f2   warning CS0253 Possible unintended reference comparison to get a value comparison, cast the right hand side to type System.FuncltSystem.ICloneablegt       codepre  pA question related to my question above is, emwhereem in the C Language Specification does it say that this shall be illegalp  precodeFuncltstringgt g1  ... FuncltUrigt g2  ... Console.WriteLineg1  g2   error CS0019 Operator  cannot be applied to operands of type System.Funcltstringgt and System.FuncltSystem.Urigt codepre  pI can see that the compiler figured out that no type can ever inherit from both codestringcode and codeUricode unlike the pair codeICloneablecode and codeIConvertiblecode, and so this if it were legal could only become codetruecode if both variables were codenullcode, but where does it say that I am not allowed to do this In this case it would not matter if the compiler chose codeoperator object, objectcode or codeoperator Delegate, Delegatecode since, as I said, it comes down to checking if both are null references, and both overloads do that in the same way.p

It did not trigger.p  pI tried with CellEndEdit event, still did not trigger.p  pIs there anything i need to do when initializing the Grid Or something to do to make the event triggerp  pEDIT 2p  pNow the event is triggered with this sollution You need to set up the event handler on the DataGridView. Go you the events panel in the properties tab and double click on the required event type, this will create and wire up you event handler... Alternatively you can do this manually by writing dataGridView1.CellValueChanged  dataGridView1CellValueChangedp  pBut it gets triggered when the grid is populated with data and i get the box many times.p  pEDIT 3 SOLUTION GIVEN  solvedp  pI have added 2 lines of codesee them in my code above. I have also reset the event in the datagrid properties and only used those 2 lines to condition the trigger.p  pThank you all for your support.p

Is it rightbr So, this justifies the behaviour in the new GregorianCalendar......br If I do  p  precodenew GregorianCalendar1582, 9, 4  codepre  pI have  p  precodecalendar[DAYOFMONTH [4], MONTH [9], YEAR [1582]]   codepre  pbecause 4 Oct 1582 exists in the julian calendar and the calendar Ive created represents a julian date.br Converting this calendar to date, we have  p  precodeDateThu Oct 04 000000 CET 1582, consistent with Calendar.   codepre  pIf I do p  precodenew GregorianCalendar1582, 9, 5    codepre  pI obtain  p  precodecalendar[DAYOFMONTH [15], MONTH [9], YEAR [1582]]   codepre  pbecause the day 5 of October neither exists in julian nor in gregorian calendar. So the GregorianCalendar constructor creates a date exactely 1 day after the 4 of October, that is the first day of the gregorian calendar, the 15 of October. The new date is then expressed in gregorian calendar system.br Ill have the same behaviour creating a new calendar passing dates from 1582, 9, 5 to 1582, 9, 14.br In the example above, the converted java.util.Date is again consistent with the Calendarp  precodeDateFri Oct 15 000000 CET 1582   codepre  pIf I do  p  precodenew GregorianCalendar1582, 9, 15   codepre  pI have  p  precodecalendar[DAYOFMONTH [15], MONTH [9], YEAR [1582]]   codepre  pbecause 15 of October exists in gregorian calendar and the new date is expressed in this system. The Calendar converted into Date is again consistent  p  precodeDateFri Oct 15 000000 CET 1582   codepre  pThis means that the GregorianCalendar constructor assumes that I enter dates in the calendar system that is valid in the given epoch in other words assumes that if I enter a date prior then or equal to 04 October Im thinking the date according to the julian calendar and the date is expressed in this system, if I enter a date between 05 and 14 October it counts the number of days between the end date of julian calendar 04 october and the date I entered and sums this days to the start date of gregorian calendar 15 October and express the new date in gregorian system, and if I enter a date after or equal to 15 October it assumes that the date I entered is meant in gregorian calendar and the new date is expressed in this system.br Is all this correctbr This is not a proleptic behaviour, right If the calendar was a proleptic gregorian calendar I would expect that initializing it with  p  precodenew GregorianCalendar1582, 9, 5   codepre  pI would obtain  p  precodecalendar[DAYOFMONTH [5], MONTH [9], YEAR [1582]]   codepre  pthat is the 5 of October is set also if the date does not exists in the gregorian system and, being 10 days befor the first day of gregorian calendar, it would be equal to the julian date 25 september, if Im not mistaken.br How can I decide to use the proleptic gregorian calendar or not  p  pParsing a String and creating a new GregorianCalendar passing through the XmlGregorianCalendar, the behaviour seems to me different.br Parsing 15821004 I obtain   p  precodecalendar[DAYOFMONTH [4], MONTH [9], YEAR [1582]]  codepre  psame as the example above..  but a date  p  precodeDate Mon Sep 24 000000 CET 1582  codepre  pHere we have a julian date, is it right But in the example above where the GregorianCalendar was created by its constructor the Date was equal to the Calendar. Why now it is different   p  pParsing the string 15821005 we have  p  precodecalendar[DAYOFMONTH [5], MONTH [9], YEAR [1582]]  codepre  pNow we have a Proleptic gregorian calendar, rightbr But again a different Date p  precodeDate Tue Sep 25 000000 CET 1582 Julian Date Why   codepre  pSame behaviour parsing 15821014 p  precodecalendar[DAYOFMONTH [14], MONTH [9], YEAR [1582]]   Date Thu Oct 04 000000 CET 1582   codepre  pIf we finally parse 15821015, we come back in the Gregorian age ad all become consistent p  precodecalendar[DAYOFMONTH [15], MONTH [9], YEAR [1582]]   Date Fri Oct 15 000000 CET 1582   codepre  pCan you help me to understand all this behavioursbr Thank you very much. p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pThank you for your answers, also if some doubt remains for me.

Negative 1078 pMy problems is that I have a method that enters into an unexpected infinite loop and I cant identify why. The method is supposed to take input from the user and assign it to three different objects. However, after the loop has run twice and has asked the user to input the name for the third object, the program loops infinitely. I should point out that I am still relatively new to java and learning to program in general.p  pHere is the codeI have started comments with  that I believe are related to the problemp  precodeprivate void readInput     This method accepts input from the user about product data and sets the values of  product1, product2 and product3 Also validates all input so as not to crash the program if the user enters incorrect data             String name             int demandRate, productChoice1      final int MAXPRODUCTS3     double setupCost, unitCost, inventoryCost, sellingPrice      Scanner console  new ScannerSystem.in      while productChoice lt MAXPRODUCTS         A loop that makes the user enter data for all three products and then stops after the third entry                                                    System.out.printlnPlease enter the products name          name  console.next                matesStore.isAProductname      checks whether the product name the user has entered is unique.         while matesStore.isAProductname           If a name that has already been entered is found, the user will be asked to reenter the name                      System.out.printlnThat name is already in use.

Negative 1078 pFor well over a year, I have been intensely using codeliftcode, codereturncode, and constructors such as codeEitherTcode, codeReaderTcode, and so forth.  Ive read Real World Haskell, Learn You a Haskell, almost every monad tutorial out there, and tried writing my own.  Yet, I constantly remain confused about these three operations.  Any time I am writing new code I try to figure out which of the three to use, and it almost always takes me an hour or more on the first function in a particular block of code.p  pWhat is an intuitive understanding of the three  Simple types are insufficient, as in all three cases I can instantly recite the types to you.

My array is [jsA1.js,jsB2.js,jsC3.js...]. When I run this through the loop.  I get the consoles of Call to file [filename] is the same sequence as in the array but consoles of [filename] is loaded are not coming in the intended sequence. p  pYes I cannot control the loading as its over the internet.

Negative 1078 pI was trying to understand how packages work in go better in terms of what golang actually enforces rather than what is usually done or considered good practice we can talk about good practice later too, but I wish to understand go first.p  pFrom a hrefhttpgolang.orgdoceffectivego.htmlpackagenames relnofolloweffective goa it saysp  blockquote   pAnother convention is that the package name is the base name of its source directory...p blockquote  pHowever, the description above doesnt seem to be forced by go or required. Thus, I was wondering, if I was allowed to have strongmultiplestrong files with strongdifferentstrong package declarations at the top in the strongsamestrong directory base. If I am allowed to have multiple package declaration in the same directory, how do I then import them and use each one separately in the same file Basically, I guess one of the problem I have is due to the wording of some of the go tutorialdocumentation. If it is by convention, then for me, its implied that it is strongNOT enforced by the languagestrong. Because for example, go programmers do NOT write the keyword codefunccode for a function by convention. We write codefunccode because otherwise go will yell at you and it will strongnot compilestrong. Thus, I wish to clarify this with the example bellow and if possible change the documentation for go, because this is a big deal in my opinion, how can this be done.p  pFor example say I have three file codeA.gocode, codeB.gocode, codeC.gocode that print a print function codePrintcode that simply prints a,b,c respectively. They are all on the same base directory called maybe codebasecode. Then each has a different package declaration codepackage Apkg, package Bpkg, package Cpkgcode. p  phow would you then go and import them Would something as follow workp  precodepackage main  import     nameA github.comusermebaseApkg     nameB github.comusermebaseBpkg     nameC github.comusermebaseCpkg   func main      nameA.Print prints a     nameB.Print prints b     nameC.Print prints c  codepre  por maybe we dont even need to specify the name if the package statments are the top are already differentp  precodepackage main  import     github.comusermebase   func main      Apkg.Print prints a     Bpkg.Print prints b     Cpkg.Print prints c  codepre  pthe printing file arep  pA.go p  precodefile at github.com.usermebase and name A.go package Apkg  import fmt  func Print     fmt.PrintlnA  codepre  pB.gop  precodefile at github.com.usermebase and name B.go package Bpkg  import fmt  func Print     fmt.PrintlnB  codepre  pC.go     file at github.com.usermebase and name C.go     package Cpkgp  precodeimport fmt  func Print     fmt.PrintlnC  codepre  pAlso, if you can have a name strongdifferentstrong from the codebasecode, could someone clarify to me how the import is actually done If the package name is codepackage Apkgcode in base does the import have to be codeimport github.comusermebasecode or codeimport github.comusermebaseApkgcode or codegithub.comusermeApkgcode.p  pI have not yet tested this but I will do so soon. The importing deal in go has been a little confusing for me and would love to get an answer and share it with the world.p

It is with sender.template. The template of sender is initialized, however it is never given a value, or id. Then when this.template.convertAndSend is called inside greet, a null pointer exception is raised on this.template.p  pI have mixed and matched both the two gound implementations of the controller and my two implementations of calling the greet method from a separate class in the application and none work.p  pIs there anyone that could shed some light on my issue Any help, tips, or advice would be greatly appreciatedp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 1078 pAs the title says, I am trying to create n children to a process. I have the following code and output. I think somewhere I allow one children to enter the loop, instead of the father, but I dont know where that happens. Or, I could think at another situation Is the father exiting before all children are created, and the orphans are adopted by another process But, if so, shouldnt that be the init process Im new to linux c, forgive me if the second scenario is wrong, but I had a similar program, where the parent was exiting, and the child did not appear to be adopted by init. It might have been something else, but Im asking in order to clarify this. Im having these doubts because I do not see where is the 1120 process created.

Negative 1078 pI have a csv file with nearly 200000 rows containing two columns name amp job. The user then inputs a name, say username, and I have to search the entire csv to find the names that contain the pattern username and finally print the output to screen. I have implemented this using ArrayList in Java where I put the entire names from csv to ArrayList and then searched for the pattern in it. But in that case the overall time complexity for searching is On. Is there any other data strucure in Java that I can use to perform the searching in ologn or something more efficient than ArrayList I cant use any database approach by the way. Also if there is a good data structure in any other language that I can use to accomplish my goal, then kindly suggest it to mep  pEdit The output should be the names in the csv that contains the pattern username as the last part. Eg If my input is son, then it should return jackson,etc. Now what I have done so far is read the name column of csv to a string ArrayList, then read each element of the ArrayList and using the regular expression patternmatcher of Java to see if the element has the username as the last part. If yes, then print it. If I implement this in a multithreaded environment, will it increase the scalability and performance of my program p

Negative 1078 pWhat is the best way of using the strongsamestrong viewmodel to support multiple viewsp  pYes..I have read MVVM with WPFBinding Multiple Views to the SameViewModel, but if I read it correctly, the answer involved creating different viewmodels which is not what I want to do here.p  pIn the below code the StringViewModel supports the InkStringView when the InkStringView consists of defined rows. I wish now to define a emsecondem view that consists of columns but must keep the emsameem datacontext of StringViewModel. In the second view, the controls have strongdifferentstrong positions and sizes that the StringViewModel emcalculatesem but thier function and purpose remain the same. It would be ideal if the module that creates the StringViewModels in Strings, an observablecollection, does not know what view will be used leaving the final decision to the xaml of the usercontrol.p  pMy question is how to design either the StringViewModel andor the DataTemplate to allow for different views and calculations based on that view by changing only the DataTemplate.p  pI tried inheriting the StringViewModel to different viewmodels, each viewmodel specific to its view, but it did not work.p  pThanks in advance for any help or suggestions.

I have looked through the documentation online and have contacted Google directly, but none of the sources I have checked will tell me if Google will allow us to use their DNS service to replicate a primary DNS server housed onsite and act as a secondary DNS for our domains. Does anyone here know if this is possible, and if it is what specifics they require to make it work. Any assistance that can be offered is appreciated.  p

Negative 1078 pI have made my self a function to calculate my monsters movements.

Negative 1078 pI am trying to remove data from a groupby once the Week becomes nonsequential by more than 1. i.e. If there is a gap in a week then i want to remove that row and subsequent rows in that group by. below is a simple example of the sort of structure of data I have and also the ideal output I am looking for.

I will post it at the end. This .net 4 framework and its been around for a while in our code. We are starting to upgrade from XP to Win 7. Basically event log sizes are limited to the 32667 number. So we had a test, if the string is bigger than that, then we would write it in 32000 byte chucks. On two different win7 boxes we get the device attached error message. Run the same code on a XP box and it works. Oh, and the Win 7 boxes are 64 bit.  I wonder if the win 7 32 bit would have the same issue Can others duplicate it The tmpsize seems to be different numbers, but if you play with it, you can get it down to number x works and x1 does not.

It is in the serverside code that I set codeSelectedcode to true where it needs to be set, for the given value, and build the options.p  pThe above example would bind my attribute codepresetcode to my models value codeSlotPositioncode, but I just want it to remember that value until it is changed, instead of permanently binding to it.  The issue I have is that in codemyChangeRoutinecode, the value for codepresetcode has already become what the dropdown was changed to.  I want this to work so that when I change the dropdowns value and codemyChangeRoutinecode runs, I can do something with the old value.p

Negative 1078 pFrom a performance tuning perspective which one is more importantp  pSay a query reports 30 scans and 148 logical reads on a table with about 2 million records.p  pA modified version of the the same query reports 1 scan with 1400 logical reads.  Second query takes about 40ms less CPU time to execute.  Is the second query betterp  pI think so and this is my thesisp  pIn the first case, we have a high number of scans on a very large table.  This is costly on CPU and server memory, since all the rows in the table have to be loaded into memory. Executing such a query thousands of times will be taxing on server resources.p  pIn the second case, we have less scans even though we are accumulating a higher number of logical reads.  Since logical reads effectively corresponds to number of pages being read from cache, the bottle neck here will be network bandwidth in getting the results back to the client.  The actual work SQL Server has to do in this case is less.p  pWhat are your thoughtsp

This works fine when you have at least one handle i.e. variable to invoke the chaining method in this case emandem on. However, if the expressions you want to chain are represented as a lambda or method reference, you need to translate one of them explicitly to a variable, which makes it very verbose. When the compiler is unable to determine the exact type, you have to resort to this kind of construction. But in most cases, this is simply verbose overhead Id like to avoid.p  pIn this example, I have written the utility method emchainem myself.  But I can create one for the other functional interfaces emFunctionem, emConsumerem, emSupplierem, emBiConsumerem, ... as well.p  pInstead of creating my own utility class with these methods which I would probably copypaste to every project I work on, I want to know whether such a class exists in the JDK or in some library p  pOn the other hand, if such a class does not exist and I shouldnt be creating one myself, I would like to hear why.p

Negative 1078 pHow could I save changes made to contentEditable sections back to original HTML file. Is this even possiblep  pI need to create a single html file that has sections for user changes. Using their web browser, I would like the user to be able to save the changes so that the original HTML file would actually be updated. This file might be stored on the users PC, it might end up hosted on a server. Wherever it is, it needs to write the changes back to the HTML file.p  pEDIT Maybe some more details will help. I am looking to create a dynamic character sheet for all the RPGs I GM. I have used doc sharing services, but the interactive and dynamic nature of HTMLjavascript offer more of what I need. Designing the file is easy enough. I just want players to open it in a web browser even if stored on their desktop, make notes and edits, and then click a save your character button that will write the elements they changed back to the original HTML file. If theres no conceivable way to do this, that ok, I would just like some definitive info. p

Negative 1078 pOne of requirements for implementing a REST Api is that the client has to send the required state information every time to the server to handle a specific request. Assume authentication is in place and Im successfully authenticating users to use the rest api, which means with every request im verifying that user has rights to access the api.p  pWhat if I have multiple users and each user has a different access right. So each user can only call a different set of webservices. Im wondering how this is normally handled by the server. I figure the only way to do this is to check the authentication of each uservia a password hash code,etc with each request to verify that he has access rights to the requested service. If that is correct then what are the recommended ways of handling authentication of multiple users in such a scenariop  pIm using flask to develop my api, so any specific suggestions will be much appreciated p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 1078 pThe space complexity of codeQuicksortcode is a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSortingalgorithm relnofollowlisted asa codeOlogncode. p  phowever  codeQuicksortcode can process without use of any additional memory  at each iteration, during the partition process,  the entries are swapped eventually to be in  the left and right partitions based on the pivot used.  this recursive swappingandthusformingthepartitions can be done on the list itself without having the  partitions at one level of recursive calls interfering  and without quicksorting in different levels of calls interfering. p  pWhats the use for extra memory in codeQuicksortcodep  pTIA. p  pp  pEDIT p  pagree with stack space in the commentsanswers had missed that. p  pstill, p  pQuicksort performs in codeOnlogncode time in the emexpected caseem  by forming nearly equalsize partitions at each level of recursion. p  pthe stackspace used is a binary tree, full tree in the optimum case, with height codelog ncode.  Each node on this tree is a recursive call, and the stackspace  in this case is on the order of codencode not codelog ncode. there are codeOncode nodes on this tree. the recursive calls to the left and right  partitions are being done simultaneously the call tree is full at a certain point of execution. p  pso the average case space complexity should be codeOncode not codeOlogncode p  pit also contradicts with the space complexity of mergesort.  mergesort space complexity is listed as codeOncode and processes similarly.  p

Negative 1078 pThere are lots of guidelines for when to use codeConfigureAwaitfalsecode, when using awaitasync in C.p  pIt seems the general recommendation is to use codeConfigureAwaitfalsecode in library code, as it rarely depends on the synchronization context.p  pHowever, assume we are writing some very generic utility code, which takes a function as input. A simple example could be the following incomplete functional combinators, to make simple taskbased operations easierp  pMapp  precodepublic static async TaskltTResultgt MapltT, TResultgtthis TaskltTgt task, FuncltT, TResultgt mapping      return mappingawait task  codepre  pFlatMapp  precodepublic static async TaskltTResultgt FlatMapltT, TResultgtthis TaskltTgt task, FuncltT, TaskltTResultgtgt mapping      return await mappingawait task  codepre  pThe question is, should we use codeConfigureAwaitfalsecode in this case I am unsure how the context capture works wrt. closures.p  pOn one hand, if the combinators are used in a functional way, the synchronization context should not be necessary. On the other hand, people might misuse the API, and do context dependent stuff in the provided functions.p  pOne option would be to have separate methods for each scenario codeMapcode and codeMapWithContextCapturecode or something, but it feels ugly.p  pAnother option might be to add the option to mapflatmap from and into a codeConfiguredTaskAwaitableltTgtcode, but as awaitables dont have to implement an interface this would result in a lot of redundant code, and in my opinion be even worse.p  pIs there a good way to switch the responsibility to the caller, such that the implemented library doesnt need to make any assumptions on whether or not the context is needed in the provided mappingfunctions p  pOr is it simply a fact, that async methods dont compose too well, without various assumptionsp  h3EDITh3  pJust to clarify a few thingsp  ol liThe problem emdoesem exist. When you execute the callback inside the utility function, the addition of codeConfigureAwaitfalsecode will result in a null sync. context.li liThe main question is how we should tackle the situation. Should we ignore the fact that someone might want to use the sync. context, or is there a good way to shift the responsibility out to the caller, apart from adding some overload, flag or the likeli ol  pAs a few answers mention, it would be possible to add a boolflag to the method, but as I see it, this is not too pretty either, as it will have to be propagated all the way through the APIs as there are more utility functions, depending on the ones shown above.p

Negative 1078 pIm currently generating a view in an EF6 Code First Database.  Im doing so via the seed method, where I drop the table for my entity, and then create the view via SQL.p  pThe problem Im running into is that if a column on the view changes, and I change it in the model, EF6 tries to alter the table which no longer exists when it updates the database.p  pWhat Im looking for is a way to solve this.  My thinking was that I could fix this one of two ways.p  pFirst, with some before migration method, I could be able to drop the view and recreate the table so that it was there for ALTER when EF6 tries to do so.  Im not sure if this functionality even exists, so theres a hangup there.p  pSecond, by telling EF6 to ignore my view entity.  This works fine for creation, but its breaking when EF6 tries to map navigation properties to my view.br This is the error I getp  precodeThe navigation property Children is not a declared property on type MyView.  Verify that it has not been explicitly excluded from the model and that it is a valid navigation property. codepre  pPreferably, I wouldnt have to move away from using DataAnnotations to do my EF6 configuration.

Negative 1078 pI have the code below which works well for small files but for large files it generates the zip as required but doesnt download it. I get all sorts of errors including Timeout which I have managed to resolve. The other problem is that it runs in Sync. The largest file I have generated myself is a 330MB zip file with about 30 HD images attached to it. But this can even go to GBs as the user can choose to download about 100 or even more HD images at once.p  pTo resolve both issues, I thought downloading in codeasynccode may help in both cases. I want to alert the user that their download has started, and that they will be notified when it is ready. p  pI am thinking of sending the stream down if the client codeIsConnectedcode then delete the file or sending an email to ask them to download the file if they have decided to logout then delete the file using the offline download link.

Negative 1078 pI found the rankorder chart also known as Pareto chart in the book Data Analysis with Open Source Tools quite useful. So I tried to plot the example in the book with ggplot2.p  pThe following figure is given in the book, note that the coordinates is flipped such that the names of countries are displayed at Yaxis which is more readable.

It is not a CDF but a cumulative proportion.p  pIn a CDF, which maps a value to its percentile rank, the percentile rank of codeUScode is 100. But in the rankorder chart, the codepercentagecode of codeUScode is about 45, indicating that sales in US takes up 45 of total sales.p  pAccordingly, I should not use codestatecdfcode to plot the rankorder chart.p

Negative 1078 pIve built an unmanaged C library to consume a web service tested, working. The web service takes a given project ID and returns the internal ID in the project management system. This is useful as I can then deeplink into projects in VBA, applications, etc.  p  pI wanted to use this library in VBA using a Declare statement I cant register it as I wont have access to the registry on client machines. This emsomewhatem works. I used the RGiesecke.DllExport library to export functions instead of the class, and for the function that returns the internal ID as an integer, this works great. What I am trying to do, however, is make a function that returns the fully built URL to VBA or whatever the caller is. This would make it much more user friendly to use the library without having to muck with string concatenation and manipulation after getting an internal ID. This is whats causing trouble  the string comes back I see it in the debug console, and then Outlook just hangs  no error, the screen will just go white and be nonresponsive. p  pTo test, I replaced the GetLink function with a simple C function with the same name amp prototype that returns Test and the same thing happens, so I dont think Im overflowing the string or anything. I then made the same function return an int and returned 0, which worked fine. Therefore, its definitely something with returning a string. I suspect its something in how the function is being called, or how VBA is trying to clean up the stack maybe string sizes are are different in C and VBA and its going into protected mem, but Im really not sure. Per some other threads, I also tried declaring the function in VBA as returning an Object, and had the same result.p  pCode for C lib and VBA sub follows.p  pstrongHeres the C librarystrongp  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Text using System.ComponentModel using System.Data using System.Runtime.InteropServices  using System.Threading.Tasks using System.Net using System.IO using RGiesecke.DllExport  public class ClarityWebService       [DllExportGetInternalID, CallingConvention  CallingConvention.StdCall]     public static int GetInternalIDstring projectID              const String USERNAME  theusername         const String PASSWORD  thepassword         int internalID         projectID  projectID.Trim          String encoded  System.Convert.ToBase64StringSystem.Text.Encoding.GetEncodingISO88591.GetBytesUSERNAME    PASSWORD         HttpWebRequest request  HttpWebRequestWebRequest.CreateltREST URLgt  projectID         HttpWebResponse response  null         Boolean responseSuccess  true          request.Method  GET             request.Headers.AddAuthorization, Basic   encoded           ACTUALLY HIT THE WEB SERVICE AND GET THE INTERNAL ID         try                      response  HttpWebResponserequest.GetResponse                  catch Exception except                      responseSuccess  false                              Only return the Internal ID on success.

Negative 1078 pI used Googles repo tool to download the CyanogenMod source code for my Android device.

Unfortunately, I had used a vulgarsounding user name and bogus email address when I ran repo init. I dont want my upload to be tagged with the vulgar, politically incorrect name.p  pThere appears to be a repo option to change the user name configname. But surprisingly, even after I do a fresh repo sync, the change in user name and email only affects two config files found in the .repomanifests.git directory. My new user name and email dont propagate to the config files found under .repoprojects, where the project metainformation is stored.p  pThis discrepancy in user names between my manifest configuration and the configuration files under .repoprojects wreaks havoc on my attempt to do  a repo upload because of the obvious authentication problems with regard to ssh public keys, etc.p  pIs there a highlevel way to propagate the change made by repo init configname across all my repo projectsp  pFor some reason, git config global user.name as well as user.email doesnt work even if the changes are visible in .gitconfig. The only other solution I can think of is to use GNU tools like find, sed and grep to force a searchandreplace operation and Im not sure if there are binary files found under .repoprojects. p

Therefore, the shared value for j is never greater than that for i, because each update to i must be reflected in the shared value for i before the update to j occurs. It is possible, however, that any given invocation of method two might observe a value for j that is much greater than the value observed for i, because method one might be executed many times between the moment when method two fetches the value of i and the moment when method two fetches the value of j.p blockquote  pSome questionsp  ul liWhat does codeshared valuescode meanli liIn which scenario should we use codevolatilecodesince any given invocation of method two might observe a value for j that is much greater than the value observed for ili ul  pI learned from other articles that if there is more than one core or processor I think the point is more than one cache, an unvolatile value may cause problems.p  pstrongWhat is the problem And whystrong  p

On bigger phones or tablet, that curve gets super stretch thus completely destroying the look.p  pa hrefhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0B7nwlrRuxLazOXNQTXI5SDVGd00viewuspsharing relnofollowDemo code linkap  pThanks all in advance for any help. I am pretty stuck with this one.p
Negative 1078 pI am trying work out how to use cython to speed up a calculation involving integration that is done within a class I have defined. Im trying to understand better how cython works with userdefined python classes. Id like to understand more about why the error described below occurs.p  pI have the following cython code in a file called codeex.pyxcodep  precodefrom libc.math cimport log from libc.math cimport sqrt import scipy.integrate as integ   cdef double integrandoutsidedouble x     Cython integrand outside the class     cdef double f  logx  sqrtx     return f   cdef class CalcSomethingobject      def integrateotherself, double a, double b         This does the integral with the integrand outside the class         return integ.quadintegrandoutside, a, b[0]      def integrateselfself, double a, double b         This does the integral with the integrand inside the class         return integ.quadself.integrand, a, b[0]      def integratewrapselfself, double a, double b         This does the integral with the integrand inside the class         return integ.quadself.wrapintegrand, a, b[0]      def wrapintegrandself, double x         Python method that wraps integrand         return self.integrandx      cdef double integrandself, double x         Cython integrand inside the class         cdef double f  logx  sqrtx         return f codepre  pIt shows three ways of calling codescipy.integrate.quadcode from within a classp  ol liUsing a cython integrand function defined outside the class codeintegrateothercode okli liUsing a cython integrand function defined inside the class codeintegrateselfcode produces errorli liWrapping the cython integrand function defined inside the class in a python function defined inside the class codeintegratewrapselfcode okli ol  pThe above cython code compiles fine.
