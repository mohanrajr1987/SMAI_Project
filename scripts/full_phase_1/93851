Positive 93851 pI have a website with a basic bootstrap carousel no nextprevious buttons, titles, etc. that changes through 20 images.  I would like it to randomly select an image from a folder each time instead of me listing each image in the HTML.  The goal is to be able to upload images to this folder at any time and they would now be available to be selected at random to appear on the website.  This would be much more convenient to update especially if the client wants hundreds of pictures to potentially show in this carousel.  Thanksp

Positive 93851 pI am trying to create a way to only display certain fields within a django form based on the bound data of another field within that same form. Im familiar with the idea of form.field.boundtype but Im not sure how to continually check for state change on a field in a form and update the other field accordingly. Something like if you were filling out an application and it asked if youve committed a crime, if you click yes then a details text area pops up. p  pIm using   Django 1.8.4   Bootstrap3 6.6.2p  pAs it pertains to this question. Here is what Ive currently got with the field values edited for work protection. It does SORT of work. Meaning the form is fine, the if statement works initially but it doesnt reevaluate the if once the specified field has changed.p  precodeltform action sendemail methodpost classcolsm5gt      csrftoken       bootstrapfield form.fieldone      bootstrapfield form.fieldtwo      bootstrapfield form.fieldthree      if form.fieldthree.bounddata  A Value           bootstrapfield form.fieldfour      endif       buttons          ltbutton typesubmit classbtn btnprimarygt              bootstrapicon glyphicon glyphiconokcircle  Submit         ltbuttongt      endbuttons  ltformgt codepre  pSolution With Birdies help I was able to figure out the solution.

Positive 93851 pI have updated to bootstrap 3.  Previously I had a div which was a circle and inside that circle there was an icon which was taken from a glyphicon. It was a perfect circle, now the circle is more of a round rectangle. If I have no icon in the circle, it will be a circle, but as soon as I put an icon into the circle it turns into a rectangle. This was not happening with the previous version of bootstrap. The jsfiddle has my current code. The fiddle will show a circle because I cant add a glyphicon of a check mark into the fiddle, but if it was there the class on the list tag, faiconcheck, is what gets the icon it would be a round rectangle instead of a circle.

Defining a Click handler for the button allows me to handle the event, but I have no idea where to get the imageFileData object that relates to the templated button.  My event handler for the button obviously passes the button as the sender, and a set of RoutedEventArgs, but I cant figure out how to relate this data back to an item from the collection in order to allow me to remove it.p  pCan anyone help me with that, or am I doomed to awkward and fruitless Google searches because I dont know where to start  p  pThanks ZSp

Negative 93851 pI have a question which is sonewhat more of a design question. I have a class which defines a bunch of functions. However, I want that the behaviour of some functions are changeable during runtime  or at least working like a plugin interface during design time. egp  precodeclass MyClass      public function doSomething   obj  new MyClass  PSEUDO CODE objgtdoSomething  doSomethingElse objgtdoSomething  does something else codepre  pI had various Ideas how to implement something like this in real code. However, I am not quite sure, which is the right way to go. I first thought I could use an Interface for this purpose.p  precodeinterface IDoSomethingInterface      public function doSomething   class DoSomethingClass implements IDoSomethingInterface    public function doSomething         I do something      class DoSomethingElseClass implements IDoSomethingInterface    public function doSomething         I actually do something else      class MyClass    public doSomethingIDoSomething doSomethingProvider        doSomethingProvidergtdoSomething      obj  new MyClass doSomethingProvider  new DoSomethingClass doSomethingElseProvider  new DoSomethingElseClass  objgtdoSomethingdoSomethingProvider  I do something objgtdoSomethingdoSomethingElseProvider  I do something else codepre  pThis approach could be expanded to not have the doSomething provider passed as a parameter, but to set it either as an object member or even class member. However, I did not like that I have to create an instance of n class which does not even contain a single member variable and the only method could easily be a static class function. Theres just no need for an object at that point imo. I then was going to try to use function variables  but Id fall out of OOP then, which I didnt like either. My questions are which is the best way to implement a system like I described Which approach would you try or use Is there anything obvious I might not have thought of Or should I just go with the interface approach and my bad feeling about instanciating bodyless objects is just nerd preciousness Im curious about your answersp  pEditp  pBecause Im really interested in clarifying if this actually is or should be a State or a Strategy Pattern, Ill go into some more detail on the implementation. I have a base class of collections from which I derive different specific implementations. I want to be able to select a single element from any specific implementation  however, I want to be able dynamically alter how this element is selected from the collection, egp  precodeclass MyCollection implements Countable, ArrayAcces, Iterator     Collection Implementation      public function selectISelectionStrategy strategy        return strategygtselectthis          interface ISelectionStrategy    public function selectMyCollection collection     class AlphaSelectionStrategy implements ISelectionStrategy    public function selectMyCollection collection        resetcollection     if currentcollection       return currentcollection     else       return null      class OmegaSelectionStrategy implements ISelectionStrategy    public function selectMyCollection collection        endcollection     if currentcollection       return currentcollection     else       return null      class RandomSelectionStrategy implements ISelectionStrategy    public function selectMyCollection collection        if countcollection       return null     rand  rand0, countcollection1     resetcollection     whilerand gt 0            nextcollection          return currentcollection      collection  new MyCollection randomStrategy  new RandomSelectionStrategy alphaStrategy  new AlphaSelectionStrategy omegaStrategy  new OmegaSelectionStrategy  collectiongtselectalphaStrategy  return first element, or null if none collectiongtselectomegaStrategy  return last element, or null if none collectiongtselectrandomStrategy  return random element, or null if none  codepre  pThis is basicly what I want to achieve. Is this now more a strategy pattern implementation or the state pattern  albeit I used the term strategy because it fits more in this case anyway. As far as I understand the strategy and state pattern a basicly the same, except their intent is different. The link provided by Gordon states that a state patterns intent is Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes  but this it not the case here. What I want is to be able to tell my MyCollection class use this or that algorithm to give me an element  not give me an element using an algorithm that you determine through your own state. Hope someone can clarify thisp  pBest regards, Danielp

Negative 93851 pI am new to both Android and Stack Overflow. I have started developing and Android App and I am wondering two thingsp  p1 Is it possible to parametrize a TextView Lets say I want to render a text message which states something like The user age is 38. Lets suppose that the user age is the result of an algorithm. Using some typical i18n framework I would write in my i18n file something like The user age is 0. Then at run time I would populate parameters accordingly. I havent been able to figure out how to do this or similar approach in Android.p  p2 Lets suppose I have a complex object with many fields. Eg PersonModel which has id, name, age, country, favorite video game, whatever. If I want to render all this information into a single layout in one of my activities the only way I have found is getting all needed TextViews by id and then populate them one by one through code. I was wondering if there is some mapping  binding mechanism in which I can execute something like rendermyPerson, myView and that automatically through reflection each of the model properties get mapped into each of the TextViews. If someone has ever worked with SpringMVC, Im looking for something similar to their mechanism to map domain objects  models to views e.g. springforms.p  pThanks a lot in advanced for your help.

Negative 93851 pstrongEdit This turned out to be an issue with temporaries.  Basically, I was ignorantly using C as if it worked like Java or C, which it does not.  Hopefully, this will be a good cautionary tale.strongp  pEdit This issue only seems to happen with the combination of codejointviewcode and codesharedptrcode.  Raw pointers seem to work fine in the same scenario, as do shared pointers in a plain fusion container constructed w all its items at once, without adding anything more to it.  Details belowp  pemIm using mingw gcc 4.5.1em Running into a peculiar issue when using boost fusion containers and getting contents back out.  I have a custom class that gets wrapped in a codestdsharedptrcode, then thats handed to a fusion codemakelistcode or codemakevectorcode, doesnt seem to matter.  All is well if I can get all of my objects into the container at one time.  The problem seems to come up when I add another shared pointer to the container, which yields a codejointviewcode.  I iterate using a codefusionforeachcode and pass in a function object to print out the value.  If Im iterating a plain fusion container of shared pointers instead of a codejointviewcode, or a codejointviewcode with no shared pointers in it, it works fine, but otherwise, segmentation fault or garbage values.p  pBelow is a test program I made to try and isolate my problem.  Any ideas on what the issue may be  Its entirely possible Im just missing something that I shouldshouldnt be doing p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltmemorygt  BOOST SMART POINTERS I only use

Negative 93851 pIm using PIL to load in various fonts and draw text to images. At the basic level, it all works.p  pHowever, I am running into a number of problems such as letters being clipped mainly cursive or stylistic fonts with lots of tails and such. textsize does return widthheight values, yet letters are still clipped. There also doesnt seem to be methods in PIL to specify larger image sizes for the character generating. Another issue is the vertical spacing. It seems PIL returns large height values for certain fonts and thus the vertical spacing between lines is overly large. p  pIm in search of a more advanced font and text handling system than PIL, given its apparent limitations.p  pIve been researching this a lot over the last week Google, Python docs, Stackoverflow, etc and Ive seen people recommending to use either Imagemagick or a combination of pango and cairo. However, as much as Ive read and searched for these respective technologies I am simply not finding any usable documentation that pertains to what I am trying to do. There are some Python bindings for Imagemagick, but they all seem several years out of date.p  pCan some of the helpful souls here on SO point me to some tutorials on how to use PangoCairo andor Imagemagickp

Negative 93851 pMy first forray into ajax webpages is causing me some problems.p  pMy basic structure is that I have a table on a page, which I want to reload without refreshing the entire page.p  pSo on clicking a button on the page it fires of thisp  precodefunction RefreshMissionsAjax    fade out the old table.   clientIDMissionsDisplay.fadeOut500    request the new value from the page calls the GetIncompleteMissions method in the MissionViewer.aspx.cs page   .ajax       type POST,       url MissionViewer.aspxGetIncompleteMissions,       data ,       contentType applicationjson charsetutf8,       dataType json,       success function msg         clientIDMissionsDisplay.htmlmsg.d       clientIDMissionsDisplay.fadeIn500     ,     error function xhr, ajaxOptions, thrownError           clientIDMissionsDisplay.htmlAn error occured while trying to refresh the page data.         clientIDMissionsDisplay.fadeIn500          codepre  pAnd I have in the code bedind of an aspx pagep  precode[WebMethod] public static string GetIncompleteMissions      return GetHTMLTable  codepre  pThis method just grabs some data, and creates a html table  nothing too fancy.p  pWhen the returned table is small a dozen rows or less then it works like a charm.

Negative 93851 pIm trying this with my Nexus One.  I have the android SDK and have used the command  adb pull datadatacom.myapp.androiddatabases Cpulls but all I get is pull building file list... 0 files pulled. 0 files skipped. Also, it seems no matter how much data I add to the tutorial NotePad app I installed, the data size for the app as shown in Settings never exceeds 8KB.  How is this possible  Is there some other place where databases are stored  When I use the File Explorer view thats part of ADT in Eclipse, I see theres nothing in data. To add a twist, I have no trouble pulling any other files from the device.  Its just databases I have trouble with. Am I missing something  Thanks much.p

Negative 93851 pWe have a wcf service that calls a slow serverside method. This method basically creates a file on the server then returns the path so the client can download that file.p  pI know the server method completes as the file gets written to the filesystem, the next line of code simply returns the path to this file.p  pOn the client the call obviously gets made but the handler is never invoked, it just sits there until timeout occurs. If I increase the timeout it will just wait longer and just silently fail when the longer timeout incurs.

Negative 93851 pLets say I have a number of base 3, 1211. How could I check this number is divisible by 2 without converting it back to base 10p  pstrongUpdatestrongbr The original problem is from TopCoderbr The digits 3 and 9 share an interesting property. If you take any multiple of 3 and sum its digits, you get another multiple of 3. For example, 1183  354 and 354  12, which is a multiple of 3. Similarly, if you take any multiple of 9 and sum its digits, you get another multiple of 9. For example, 759  675 and 675  18, which is a multiple of 9. Call any digit for which this property holds interesting, except for 0 and 1, for which the property holds trivially.  A digit that is interesting in one base is not necessarily interesting in another base. For example, 3 is interesting in base 10 but uninteresting in base 5. Given an int base, your task is to return all the interesting digits for that base in increasing order. To determine whether a particular digit is interesting or not, you need not consider all multiples of the digit. You can be certain that, if the property holds for all multiples of the digit with fewer than four digits, then it also holds for multiples with more digits. For example, in base 10, you would not need to consider any multiples greater than 999.br strongNotesstrongbr   When base is greater than 10, digits may have a numeric value greater than 9. Because integers are displayed in base 10 by default, do not be alarmed when such digits appear on your screen as more than one decimal digit. For example, one of the interesting digits in base 16 is 15.br strongConstraintsstrongbr   base is between 3 and 30, inclusive. p  pThis is my solutionp  precodeclass InterestingDigits  public     vectorltintgt digits int base           vectorltintgt temp         for int i  2 i lt base i              if base  i  1                  temp.pushback i          return temp       codepre  pThe trick was well explained here  a hrefhttpmath.stackexchange.comquestions17242howdoesbaseofanumberrelatetomodulosofitseachindividualdigithttpmath.stackexchange.comquestions17242howdoesbaseofanumberrelatetomodulosofitseachindividualdigitap  pThanks,br Chan p

Negative 93851 pIm trying out modifications to the following particle system. a hrefhttpcreate.msdn.comenUSeducationcatalogsampleparticle3d relnofollowhttpcreate.msdn.comenUSeducationcatalogsampleparticle3dap  pI have a function such that when I press Space, all the particles have their positions and velocities set to 0.p  precodefor int i  0 i lt particles.GetLength0 i          particles[i].Position  Vector3.Zero           particles[i].Velocity  Vector3.Zero    codepre  pHowever, when I press space, the particles are still moving. If I go to FireParticleSystem.cs I can turn settings.Gravity to 0 and the particles stop moving, but the particles are still not being shifted to 0,0,0.p  pAs I understand it, the problem lies in the fact that the GPU is processing all the particle positions, and its calculating where the particles should be based on their initial position, their initial velocity and multiplying by their age. Therefore, all Ive been able to do is change the initial position and velocity of particles, but Im unable to do it on the fly since the GPU is handling everything.p  pI want the CPU to calculate the positions of the particles individually. This is because I will be later implementing some sort of wind to push the particles around. How do I stop the GPU from taking over I think its something to do with VertexBuffers and the draw function, but I dont know how to modify it to make it work.p

Negative 93851 pI have an application which will manage releases of DDL changes and TSql Executable statements to a SQL server database.  p  pBasic workflow  Developer submits .sql file, file is collected, SQL reviewed and assigned a step in a release cycle, release is executed in the database using a stored procedure and it will cycle through the steps executing the SQL within a single SQL transaction using spEXECUTESQL.  If any errors occur the transaction does not commit the DDL changes.  This process manages SQL from a single database to multiple database on the same instance.p  pThe problem I have is that when the SQL scripts are submitted they contain GO statements which spEXECUTESQL does not support and throws the Incorrect syntax near GO error.   I can split and break up most transactions by parsing on the GO keyword but this will not work for items that are in other databases.  Once I have an ALTER of some sort against another database I need the GO.    e.g. the following hase ot be executed together, cannot be split and executed as two statementsp  precodeUSE [MyDatabaseOtherThanOneIAmExecutingFrom] GO Alter PROCEDURE [dbo].[DoSomething] ... codepre  pSyntactically the following statement wont work so requesting the devs to change their sql to prefix with a db name would only cover non DDL SQLp  precode Alter PROCEDURE [MyDatabaseOtherThanOneIAmExecutingFrom].[dbo].[DoSomething] codepre  pOriginal requirement was to stay within the database to perform these deployment actions so writing a short one off application to execute the batches from .Net using SqlCommand was not an option.p  pIs there another option to handle this within the database or do I need to extend outside and create an application to manage the SQL steps executionp

I am assuming that the passengers have seats which are same as the order in which they enter. so the 1st passenger enter has a designated seat number 1, 2nd to enter has no. 2 etc.  def cior   Says if the seat is occupied  1 if occupied, 0 if not     if rand[r][2]1         return 1     if rand[r][2]0         return 0  def assignini,mov     The first is passenger no. and the second is the final seat he gets. So I keep on chaning the mov variable if the seat that he randomly picked was occupied too.      if ciorand[mov][2] 0          rand[mov][2]  1         rand[mov][1]  ini     elif ciorand[mov][2] 1          mov2  random.randint0,99         printmov2            Was used to debug.. didnt really help         assignini,mov2         I get the error pointing to this line    Defining the first passengers stats. rand[0][0]  1 rand[0][1]  random.randint1,100 m  rand[0][1] rand[m][2] 1  for x in range99     rand[x1][0]  x  2  for x in range99     assignx1,x1  if rand[99][0]rand[99][1]      print1 else      print0 codepre  pPlease tell me if yall get the same error..

Negative 93851 pI am in the design stage of a web application that allows users to create requests of work and the workers to put time against those requests. The application will also have reporting capabilities for supervisors to get daily totals, reports, and account for time spent, cost allocation.p  pApplications Ive worked on in the past have been designed using the package by layer approach. Im thinking it would be more efficient to use a package by feature design and I have a question about this design.p  pWhat I am currently thinking for the packages by featurep  ol liRequests  CRUD the requests, assign then, add invoice numbers, etc...li liWork Time  CRUD daily time for users against requests, holiday, training, or meetingsli liCost Allocation  create reports, accounting things that accountants want ...li ol  pThe frontend will be Tomcat server and JSP. And, the backend will be an Oracle database with EclipseLink doing the persistence. p  pMy questionp  pIn my understanding of package by feature, the entities and DAOs would go into the package associated with them. Spreading out the persistence layer across several packages. Leaving packages to call entities from other packages. With all of the overlap is this really functional There would be no isolation between the packages. What are the pros and cons to using package by feature Would it be good design to go with an additional persistence layer Or, do I have the understanding of this totally wrongp

Negative 93851 pTwo closelyrelated data structures are the suffix tree and suffix array.  From what Ive read, the suffix tree is faster, more powerful, more flexible, and more memoryefficient than a suffix array.  However, in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2487576trievssuffixtreevssuffixarray67233226723322this earlier question,a one of the top answers mentioned that suffix arrays are more widely used in practice.  I dont have any experience using either of these structures, but right now it seems like I would always prefer a suffix tree over a suffix array for problems that needed the functionality they provide fast substring checking, for example.p  pIn what circumstances would a suffix array be preferable to a suffix treep  pBy the way, while this question is related to the one Ive linked, I dont think its an exact duplicate as Im interested solely in a comparison of suffix arrays and suffix trees, leaving tries completely out of the picture.  If you disagree, though, I would understand if this question were to be closed.p

Negative 93851 pIm not sure I understand the advantagepurpose of multitable inheritance but it may be what Im looking for. Im dealing with Restaurants. My current logic is that I have a codeCompanycode model which is likely but not always a Restaurant. Sometimes a Company can be a parent company, inwhich case the codeCompanycode model has a onetomany with a codeBranchcode model. Both the codeCompanycode and codeBranchcode models would have common fields, such as street address, contact info. If the Company has only one branch I can assume its the Restaurant itself and so I dont need to attach a codeBranchcode object to the codeCompanycode. Does this make sense I know im repeating myself with with the street address [...] but it seems like an elegant way to store the data if I were to read the db directly.p  pIm not sure if multitable inheritance is what I need. I just cant wrap my head around it by only looking at a hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comendevtopicsdbmodelsmultitableinheritance relnofollowhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comendevtopicsdbmodelsmultitableinheritancea.p  pedit also open to taking any suggestions on a better db layout if im doing it wrong.p

I couldnt use the query or query2 as datasources for the gridview, but query3 did work for simple textboxes. 2.  If using query3 as the gv.datasource, why would my combobox throw bankgpfieldname not found error when the  gv.Columns.AddcomboCol was executed 3.  I understand the reason I couldnt do a gv bind to query3 because of the data in BankBankfieldnumber is an integer and the DDL values dont have a translation between the integer and the string value.  But I commented out that field expecting the GPField to operate on a standard bind.  I still got the Field called BankGPFieldName does not exist on gv.Columns.AddcomboColp  pSo, summed up, why doesnt the code below work whereas the one above doesp  precode    Function fillToleranceFieldsGridViewByVal nTrxType As String As Integer     Dim myConn As New Connection With .ConnCls  ConnCls     Try         Using db As New CompanyDataDataContext             myConn.dbConnectdb             Dim query As IEnumerableOf TWOToleranceField  From tf In db.getToleranceSetupRecordFieldsnTrxType, BankToleranceRecordTypes.MasterRecord                           Select tf             Dim query2 As IEnumerableOf TWOToleranceField  db.getToleranceSetupRecordFieldsnTrxType, BankToleranceRecordTypes.MasterRecord             Dim query3  From t In db.TWOToleranceFields                             Where t.TRXTYPESTRING  nTrxType And t.RCRDTYPE  BankToleranceRecordTypes.MasterRecord                             Select t.BankBankFieldNumber, t.BankGPFieldName, t.TRXTYPESTRING              Dim gv  Me.DataGridViewX1             gv.AutoGenerateColumns  False             gv.AllowUserToAddRows  False             gv.AllowUserToDeleteRows  False             gv.AllowUserToResizeRows  False             gv.AutoSize  True             gv.AutoSizeColumnsMode  DataGridViewAutoSizeColumnsMode.AllCells              gv.DataSource  query3              If Not Me.GridViewIsConstructed Then                  Add in the combo box for GPField Names                 Dim comboCol As DataGridViewComboBoxColumn                 comboCol  CreateComboBoxColumnMe.ddlGPField.Items,                                                   ColumnNameData.BankGPFieldName.ToString,                                                   FieldNames.GPField.ToString                  gv.Columns.AddcomboCol                  comboCol  CreateComboBoxColumnMe.ddlBankField.Items,                                                    ColumnNameData.BankBankFieldNumber.ToString,                                                    FieldNames.BankField.ToString                  gv.Columns.AddcomboCol                  Dim col As DataGridViewColumn                       New DataGridViewTextBoxColumn                  Dim cell  New DataGridViewTextBoxCell                 Dim coll  New DataGridViewColumncell                 Dim colIndex As Integer  0                  Bind to an existing column Left in for easy access for a simple text box                 coll  New DataGridViewColumncell                 coll.Name  ColumnNameData.BankGPFieldName.ToString                 coll.ReadOnly  True                 coll.HeaderText  ColumnNameData.BankGPFieldName.ToString                 colIndex  gv.Columns.Addcoll                 gv.ColumnscolIndex.DataPropertyName  ColumnNameData.BankGPFieldName.ToString                  Me.GridViewIsConstructed  True             End If              gv.Rows.Clear             Dim ri As Integer  0             For Each r In query3                 Dim row As New DataGridViewRow                 row.CreateCellsgv                 row.CellsFieldNames.GPField.Value  r.BankGPFieldName.ToString.Trim                 row.CellsFieldNames.BankField.Value  ddlBankField.Itemsr.BankBankFieldNumber  1.ToString.Trim                 gv.Rows.Addrow                 ri  1             Next             db.Connection.Close             db.Connection.Dispose         End Using         Return 0     Catch ex As Exception         Throw ex     Finally         myConn.Dispose     End Try End Function  Private Function CreateComboBoxColumnByVal obj As ComboBox.ObjectCollection, ByVal nDataFieldName As String, ByVal nColName As String   As DataGridViewComboBoxColumn      Dim column As New DataGridViewComboBoxColumn     With column         .HeaderText  nColName         .DropDownWidth  160         .Width  90         .MaxDropDownItems  3         .FlatStyle  FlatStyle.Flat         .DataSource  obj         .DataPropertyName  nDataFieldName         .Name  nColName         .ValueMember  nDataFieldName         .DisplayMember  .ValueMember     End With     Return column End Function codepre

Negative 93851 pOk So Id like trying to figure out the best way to go about making a simple 2D game that runs in the browser. Ive looked at HTML5 and the Canvas element. It seems you use JavaScript though and Ive read you cant connect to a MySQL database from JavaScript so connection from a Canvas element, which seems to use JavaScript, seems to be out of the picture. p  pIve also been looking into running an Applet in the browser and communicating with a Servlet that then connects to the browser and then relays info from the database back to the Applet. I read this is the better way to do it to avoid connecting strait from the applet which is insecure and potentially allowing people access to the database.

Negative 93851 pI stumbled on aichallenge.org last week and I thought this Ants game was a good way to both learn Python and learn to code AI.  p  pThe game is a x,y grid  which can contain up to one ant.  Tiles can be denoted as land or water, which is impassable.p  pMy AI is doing a good job, sending ants to collect food through a breadthfirst search algorithm and attacking enemy hills using A pathfinding.p  pHowever, the algorithm I am trying to implement for exploration is taking way too much time, about 700 ms.  My AI is only allowed 500 ms per turn, which means it is disqualified.p  pTo perform exploration, I want to assign an ExploreValue to each tiles.  This value starts at 0 at the start of the game and increases by 1 every turn the tile is hidden under the fog of war.  When a tile is visible, I want the explore value to be reset to 0.  Each ants has a sight radius of 10 squares.p  pFirst, I run a breadthfirst search from each ant to tag tiles as visible.  This takes about 10 ms per ant After that, I iterate through every tile on the map to update their ExploreValue.  If they are tagged as visible then the value is reset to 0, else it is increased by one.p  pThis takes more than half a second on maps that must be about 100x100.p  pHere is the code, what do you think I could do to make this run faster I already converted my lists to sets since they are supposed to be faster.p  pdef dosetup is run once at the start of the game, def doturn is run every turn in the game.p  precodedef dosetupself, ants   self.tilevisible  set     self.explorevalue       for row in rangeants.rows      for col in rangeants.cols         self.explorevalue[row, col]0   def doturnself, ants     self.tilevisible  []  empty visible list  Define visible tiles set     antstilesscandistance10      for ant in ants.myants start bfs of length antstilescandistance         tilesdist   dict visited tiles         tilesfrom   dict previous tiles         fromnodes[]         fromnodes.appendant         tonodes[]         closefriendscount[ant]0          steps1         while stepsltantstilesscandistance and lenfromnodesgt1             for fromnode in fromnodes                 for newloc in ants.tilesvoisins[fromnode]                      if newloc not in tilesdist                         tilesdist[newloc]steps                         tonodes.appendnewloc                          if newloc not in self.tilevisible                             self.tilevisible.appendnewloc              fromnodestonodes             tonodes[]             stepssteps1   Update ExploreValues       for tile in self.explorevalue.keys          if tile in self.tilevisible             self.explorevalue[tile]0         else             self.explorevalue[tile]self.explorevalue[tile]1 codepre

The problem is I cant understand and cant find any explanation whats the meaning of the result when I ask for bboth partial derivatives at the same timeb, since there isnt any obvious numeric or visual meaning. For example, if I use codedxcode AND codedycodep  precodeself.meshshadow  inter.bisplevyy.flat, xx.flat, self.spline, dx1, dy1 codepre  pI get this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comE2qnN.png altenter image description herep  pSo, I wonderp  ol liWhats the mathematicalgeometrical meaning of the simultaneous result of firstorder partial derivatives of a surface as given by codebislplev..., dx1, dy1code, if anyli liWould there be a way to get the maximum slope in any direction from codebislplev..., dx1, dy1codeli liAre both partial derivatives supposed to be called together, in the first place I see I can use, say, code..., dx1, dy2code and the function seems to produce valid results, but would that make any senseli ol  pEvery time, the returned value is a Y,Xshaped array of single float values Z or one of its derivativerelated values.p  pAny helpp  pThanks for readingp

Negative 93851 pI have a State class that includes configuration as well as some statespecific methods. I also have a Factory class that I inhertit my MVC classes from that also has a reference to this State object. This makes sure that all of my MVC objects have specific Staterelated functionality. For example, my State class includes methods for setting and reading cache or sessions.p  pMy Factory class has a number of methods that are simply wrappers, like thisp  precodepublic function myFunctiondata     thisgtStategtmyFunctiondata  codepre  pThe idea is that these methods are defined in Factory, but are actually executed by State object. This allows me to call codethisgtmyFunctioncode rather than the longer one that includes State in it, when writing code.p  pI dont know enough about how PHP works internally, but is this efficient My thought process has been that since I usually only have one instance of State object, then having method wrappers in my Factory class is better, because otherwise those methods would include a lot of code that is not used most of the time. But I am not sure how PHP works internally.p  pAt times I can have dozen objects that have the parent Factory class and all of them reference the same State object. Is it efficient to have wrapper methods defined in Factory that simply call methods of State, rather than deal with State directly Or am I just adding additional overhead to the whole systemp  pMy idea was that if Factory is simply a class that is inherited and includes wrappers for a lot of functionality, then I can streamline development more efficiently. Does it save memory if the class that you inherit from has wrappers as opposed to fully defined code in methodsp

Negative 93851 pI have NO access to the server options, so Im hoping someone can help guide me to some likely problems before the server guy can get back to me. My application was working fine last week until the application pool suddenly stopped. It was restarted by IT, and so I tried to load my page again. Application pool stopped again receiving a 503 server error. It happened over and over and over again. They put me in my own application pool, and it is still happening, so it is obviously my application, but I have no idea why. I receive no error messages, the it guy says that he cant see any errors, either. I deleted after copying to another location all of my files and started building them up again. It shows me compilation errors telling me xxx file does not exist. I add the file, and it moves to the next error. When I finally fix the last error, I get a message in Firefox telling me that the connection was reset. I have no idea what is happening, and I cant see error messages anywhere. Is there somewhere that I should tell the IT guy to look Any particular server logs that might let him know what is happening.

Negative 93851 pSay I had an app where customers can make a type of booking, and then I had an admin interface  to manage these incoming customer bookings. p  pHow would I allow new bookings to be pushed to the admin interface without refreshing. Similar to how Facebook push new notifications to you.p  pI looked at AJAX however, from what I understand this only works by calling the data, which can be done by setting an interval like every 5 seconds. This seems unideal as even when no new data is available the function will run, wasting bandwidth, and risking performance. p  pWhat I am looking for is a way for the server to pass booking data over to the admin interface everytime, a customer makes a new booking.p  pI have looked at an app called pusher, but I dont really know how this would work with something like PHP codeinigter, and how to implement itp  pDoes anyone have any information on this kind of system im talking aboutp  pThanksp

Negative 93851 pIve been fooling around with GAS for a month or so now, and Ive become fairly familiar with using batch operations to readwrite tofrom spreadsheets e.g. getValues, setValues. However, Im currently writing a script that pulls a sizable amount of data out of Gmail using class GmailApp, my code is running very slowly and even timing out, and I cant seem to figure out how to use batch operations for what Im trying to do.

Then Im looping through each thread and when a given email matches the sender Im looking for, I create an instance of the Email object for that email and place that Email object into an array. The goal is that in the end Ill have an array of Email objects that are all from my desired sender. However as youve probably noticed the code calls Googles APIs way too often, but I cant seem to figure out batch operations for interfacing with Gmail. Any ideas Thanks so much.p

It is also important to note that loads of these operations will occur per second so, can Redis be the best choice for thisp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 93851 pWe have a ssis pkg that takes 20 mins to complete. generates a xl report. Users had requested ability to control this pkg via params so we have winformsc gui that runs the pkg. Direct from sql server. We basically call a stored proc that starts a sql job that runs the ssis pkg. So far so good. Now users want to log off after submitting the report request since it does not make sense to wait for 20 mins. we use citrix vdi. Users loginto specific vdi depending on the apps they want to use, do their tasks and logoff. We are 90 there and just for this functionality service broker seems to be an overkill. I checked with our dba and we have never used service broker till now. Is there someway I can get the ssis pkg to run even if the user closed the winforms app and logged off. basically sql connection is lost but the fired ssis pkg on sql server must continue to run to completion. thanksp

Negative 93851 pI am trying to understanding the emEvent Aggregator patternem from an architecture and design view point. I have never used Prism in WPF before, but Im studying how it works on MSDN.p  pIt seems to me that for every event, the user has to create a new event object that extends the codeCompositePresentationEventcode. It also appears that the new event object has no functionality other than those it inherited from it usually has no code for itself. p  pSo for examplep  pA  codeAddNewStuffEventcode would look likep  precodepublic class AddNewStuffEvent  CompositePresentationEventltObjectgt  The end of the class codepre  pFor a codeHealthChangeEventcodep  precodepublic class HealthChangeEvent CompositePresentationEventltObjectgt  The end of the class codepre  pFor a codeBookFlipEventcodep  precodepublic class BookFlipEvent CompositePresentationEventltObjectgt  The end of the class codepre  pFor a codeBookCloseEventcodep  precodepublic class BookCloseEvent CompositePresentationEventltObjectgt  The end of the class codepre  pAnd this can go on forever for every little small event for codeBookOpenEventcode, codeBookTearEventcode, etc. So, in a particular namespace folder, there will be a whole ton of event classes, and the Event Aggregator is going to be loaded with all these event objects during runtime. Thats, every little small event needs an empty class Is this how it works What could be a better way for thisp

Negative 93851 pSo, I have a class called codePuzzlecode, and two relevant constructors for it.  One constructor accepts no args, and the other takes an int, but also throws an exception.  The basic idea is like thisp  precodepublic class Puzzle       Fields, methods, etc.     public Puzzle          this3           public Puzzleint n throws Exception          if n lt 2 throw new Exception           More constructor code       codepre  pOf course, this doesnt compile, because the constructor that takes an int throws an exception, and the constructor without args doesnt handle or throw the exception.  But, since it is plain to see that the exception never will be thrown there are no more exceptions thrown in the body of the constructor, this shouldnt matter.  I could just use a blank trycatch statement like thisp  precodepublic Puzzle      try          this3      catch Exception e           Never happens       codepre  pThe problem here is that the call to codethis3code is no longer the first statement of the constructor, so it wont compile.  It seems like I have to mark this constructor with a codethrowscode clause even though I know it will never throw an exception.  This is really annoying, because calling code will then need to have unnecessary trycatch blocks or they will have to throw the exception too.  Is there an elegant way around this that Im missing  I know I could easily copy and paste some code, but that goes against the grain of all that is holy in OOP.  Any ideasp

My code loops through a set of 25 skills and gets the image for each one of those and displays the users information on the same row as the image.  How would I go about caching the images so that the code runs faster and the image doesnt have to be constantly loaded  Here is what my code looks like p  precode    function compareuser1      include mysql.ws     user1  strreplace , , user1     query  mysqlquerySELECT a., b.

Negative 93851 pIm using touch events to handle swiping a table containing roughly 350 rows. The number of rows is variable as they are pulled from a Google Spreadsheet.

Negative 93851 pThis is my first ever post here, so please excuse any formatting issues.  p  pI have an interactive program which spawns external processes and monitors their IO.  Things work fine until I spawn something off with mpiexec, after which STDIN appears to break.  p  pI realize this will be difficult to reproduce for most folks, but if anyone sees anything obvious or knows of this problem.... please helpp  pHeres a snippetp  precodeint main ...     stdstring choice   whilestdgetlinestdcin,choice      ifchoice.empty        ifchoice  Parallel         systemmpiexec .aprogram                ifchoice  Serial         system.aprogram                 Now the external process is done... so far, so good        stdcout ltlt Program is done.

The weirdest thing is that if I dup off and save stdin and then restore it after mpiexec returns, then I no longer get EOF on stdcin, but instead, stdgetlinestdcin,... no longer blocks The program goes into an infinite loop reading zero bytes off stdcin in the stdreadline call.  p  pIf, while the external process is running under mpiexec, I stack a bunch of data into stdcin e.g. by typing, then subsequent calls to stdreadline correctly parse the lines of data that I have stuck in there, but again... once it is done reading through that data, it just keeps going in an infinite loop i.e. not blocking on stdreadlinestdcin,.. even if there is no data to read  Ugh.  So annoying.p  pAny help is deeply appreciated.p  pCheersp

This is causing the codeSKPaymentTransactionObservercode to be called multiple times with a codeSKPaymentTransactionStatePurchasedcodep  pThis problem seems to manifest more when I stop the app mid upgrade, or put the application in the background.p  pI am not sure what is causing the multiple payments, or is this expected behavior Also, am making sure to finish all purchased transactions after they are validated.p

This all seems to work fine if I write a grammar just specifying the definitions, including productions likep  precodedefinition      namelist propertylist       namelist      name      namelist , name       propertylist      property      propertylist , property       property      name  name      codepre  pNow, I add rules for the expression part of the grammar, in a fairly normal way as far as I can tellp  precodeexpr      expr  expr      expr  expr      name      codepre  pJison complains that multiple actions possible for a bunch of different lookahead tokens in some numbered state. The reduction options usually look likep  precode reduce by rule namelist gt name  reduce by rule expr gt name codepre  pI believe the grammar to be unambiguous, but how can I convince Jison of this It seems it might need to look ahead two tokens instead of one, but thats a blind guess, and the Jison documentation notes that it does not yet support LLemkem grammars.p
Negative 93851 pIm new to C and was reading a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary9fkccyh428vvs.8029.aspx relnofollowthe article about the codevirtualcode keyword at the MSDNa. In their example code, they create the following classp  precodepublic class Dimensions      protected double x, y      public Dimensions                public Dimensionsdouble x, double y              this.x  x         this.y  y           public virtual double Area              return x  y       codepre  pWhy did they add the first constructor the one that does not require any parameters I get that the two double values codexcode and codeycode default to 0 so adding this constructor does not hurt. But Ive seen this now numerous times and am therefore wondering if there is any special reason behind always adding such a constructor Should I always do thisp

Negative 93851 pI have two matrices, one matrix with values ranging from code01code, and another having only values of code0code and code1code. Im interested in calculating the distance only to those pixels equal to code1code. In this case, I thought of making a new matrix that only contains the pixels with value code1code from the second object and then taking the distance to those. But, in this case, the dimensions will differ. p  pNote The two matrices are originally of the same dimension. But, there are many cels not of interest i.e those having value code0codep  pHow can I perform such distance calculation with objects of different dimensionsp  pThanks.p

I just want the user to be able to see what I display  in a read only format  when they navigate to the page.

These steps shouldnt be necessary. I just want to download the file and be able to manipulate it either in memory or as a stream then display something about it.p  pAlso, I may misunderstand how OAuth 2.0 works so if that seems like the case, any helpful information would be much appreciated.

Negative 93851 pDear All especially Ryan, thank you for this great work, I am just going completely nut with something that probably is just really stupid, but that for the life of me I cant wrap my brain around and solve it.p  pI am trying to use Can Can, for authorization, and I set it up correctly on everything except and this is my issue, on a specific thing, that apparently works fine, but that I am not sure if I am doing it right or not  actually I think I am not able to prove that it doesnt work properly.p  pLets see if I am able to explain clearly what I am doingp  pI have two models User and Album, that are connected through a third model Sharep  h1A  User Modelh1  precodehasmany albums, dependent gt destroy  ownership hasmany shares, foreignkey gt shareduserid , dependent gt destroy hasmany sharedalbums, through gt shares codepre  h1B  Album Modelh1  precodebelongsto user hasmany shares, foreignkey gt sharedalbumid, dependent gt destroy hasmany sharedusers, through gt shares codepre  h1C  Share Modelh1  precodebelongsto shareduser, foreignkey gt shareduserid, classname gt User belongsto sharedalbum, foreignkey gt sharedalbumid, classname gt Album codepre  pNow, in my Ability class, what I would love to do is restricting the actions that can be performed, by a specific user on the C Share Model.p  pIn my app, an user can create an album, and after he can add other users to that album this users are the only one that can access the specific album. In addition, every user that is part of an album,can also add on it new users.p  pAll this is done giving to the users present in the album, the ability to create share the Share model relate the User and the Album model.p  pNow the big question, how I restrict the ability to addcreate share to a specific album, only to that users that are part of that albumthrough sharep  pIf for example I havep  pusers  id 1,2,3,4 [a total of 4 users in my appp  palbums  id 45,32 [a total of 2 albums in my appp  pshares  album 45  [user 1,2,3]  album 32  [users1,4] [a total of 5 shares in my app]p  pHow I can say in the Ability class that on album 32for example, just the user 1 and 4 can addcreate new shareadd new user, and that instead the user 2 or 3 they cantp  pI already restricted the ability for the user 2 and 3 to anyway access the resource album 32 I did that on the Album class level, but I want be sure that for whatever reason the ability to create users is restricted also.p  pWhat I have until now in my Ability Class isp  precodedef initializeuser    A ALBUM LEVEL        1 Every User can create Album, without restrictions      can create, Album           2 Only the user that own the Album can manage it      can manage, Album, userid gt user.id         3 The Album can be read by all the users that are part of that specific album      can read, Album, shares gt shareduserid gt user.id        4 The Album can be read by every user if the privacy attribute is false      can read, Album, privacysetting gt false     B SHARE LEVEL        1 Only the user that own the Album can manage all the shares for the album      can manage, Share, sharedalbum gt userid gt user.id        2 The other users in the album, can just manage themself their share      can manage, Share, shareduserid gt user.id        3 The Share in the album can be read by every user if privacy is false just read      can [read], Share, sharedalbum gt privacysetting gt false      cannot [create,destroy,delete], Share, sharedalbum gt privacysetting gt false     X CRUCIAL POINT CREATE NEW SHARE      can create, Share, sharedalbum gt sharedusers gt id gt user.id   end codepre  pIs the condition in XCRUCIAL POINT the right condition to allow just users that are already part of the album, to add new user to the albump  pThis is completely driving me insane.p  pThank you to everybody, and especially to who will be able to let me understand a bit more of all this.p  pBest Dinuzp

Negative 93851 pIs there a strongstandard SWT controlstrong that resembles a strongbuttonstrong which strongdisplays an arrowstrong and strongopens a dropdown menustrong when pressed and is strongnot a toolbaronly controlstrongp  pIt would be something like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjbN5f.png altenter image description herep  pIt is similar to a combo box control, except that the button area would act more similarly to an actual button  its text would not change based on your selection, it would appear depressed when clicked, and the items would be used for actions or navigational purposes instead of for selection.  Its also similar to a control available for toolbars, but I need to use it on a regular composite instead.p  pThis is nearly doable simply by using regular button and popupmenu controls  however, I do not believe I can display the arrow next to the text on the button this way.  Anyway, since this kind of control seems fairly common, I assumed there would be a standard way to use these two things as one.p

Now the issue is how do I tell C a function should NOT be inline I emthinkem codeSingleton makesingleton volatilecode should do that but im positive I am wrong.p

Negative 93851 pIve been developing publishing features for my website using socket.io on a node server.  Ive been having issues over the past month or so with the socket connections becoming painfully slow or altogether unresponsive after only a couple days running.  The server is not out of memory.  Im not fairly familiar with debugging this kind of issue.  p  pThe socket.io logs were not telling me much beyond websocket connection invalid or client not handshaken client should reconnectp  pI had googled around and eventually saw a thread recommending running netstat in the command line and saw a large number of connections in FINWAIT2 and CLOSEWAIT and figured that was the cause of my issue.  After looking at some threads on the socket.io github related recommended upgrading to branch 0.9.14 I had been running 0.9.13 at the time. p  pI have since done so and am still having periods of downtime when the server has only been running for a few days straight. My site does not get anywhere near the amount of traffic where this should be an issue.  p  pA new error has started popping up in my logs websocket parser error no handler for opcode 10, but my googling has turned up squat on the issue.

Negative 93851 pWe are using application request routing with 5 servers running IIS 7.5 and have just recently implemented a messaging system using SignalR in our application.p  pThe SignalR connections are working as we expect with the only drawback being that a message sent from one server doesnt get activated on the other 4.p  pThe problem we are having is that the Response Time of some requests on IIS that are shown in the load balancer ARR are coming up as 23 minutes sometimes, which I am assuming are because of connections using something like longpolling.p  pOur ARR is set to load balance using lowest response time, but it seems like this metric will be completely incorrect because of these SignalR connections. Is there any way to fix these connections so they dont get used in the ARR calculation for response time Are we stuck having to move the SignalR messages to a separate server to avoid this type of thing which admittedly would solve other things as wellp

Negative 93851 pIve been using a hrefhttpsgithub.comativedocjure relnofollowdocjurea to write to excel files. Mostly I want to append rows to already existing files, usually one at a time. When I do this without agentsfuture, I load the file, use addrows to add the data, and then rewrite the file like thisp  precodedefn append [filename data] data is in the same format as createworkbook, i.e. [[n m] [1 2] [3 4]] let [workbook loadworkbook filename                 sheet selectsheet workbook Sheet1]   addrows sheet data   saveworkbook filename workbook codepre  pI make a lot of calls to append, so I found this a hrefhttpblakesmith.me20120525understandingclojureconcurrencypart2.html relnofollowhttpblakesmith.me20120525understandingclojureconcurrencypart2.htmla, which shows you how to use agents to write to a file using future.p  pFirst of all, Im using FileOutputStream instead of FileWriter, which would still work, except whereas in the tutorials example you just append strings to the end of the file using .write and then close, I need to rewrite the file every time I append I think since theres more bytes in a .xlsx workbook than just characters.p  pI dont really know how to set this up since with the tutorials logging example, writeout returns the updated instance of the BufferedWriter and I dont know what the equivalent of that would be.p  pMy other option would be to add the data to the vector concurrently load the file once and keep returning new vectors [[n m] [1 2] [3 4]] with the data added but Im planning on doing 10000100000 of these calls and that seems like a lot to keep track of... although to be fair reading and writing all the data that many times is probably not that great either.p  pIf you have any suggestions on how I can do this, Id appreciate it. Id be willing to make calls to the Apache POI itself too, if theres a better way to append with that. Thanks.p  pstrong UDPATE strongp  pI just rewrote the the logger example with the file as an agent instead of the output stream and it seems to work. Ill let you know if it ends up working with docjureApache POI.p  precodedef logfile agent File. blah.txt  defn writeout [file msg]   withopen [out BufferedWriter. FileWriter. file true]     .write out msg   file codepre  pstrong UDPATE 2strongp  pI got an analogous version written with docjure, but the unfortunately because opening the file happens within writeout and that happens during each future I dont see a way around this if I use File as an agent, and I dont see another way to do it besides that most of them read the empty file and write the row to that since theyre all done in parallel and the end result is that most of them overwrite each other. p  pUltimately I decided to just add each row vector to an overall data vector and write once. I can do that with just pmap, so its a lot neater. The one downside is if something goes wrong none of the data is written to the file at all, but the upside is that the time it takes to write is reduced since theres only one write call. Also, I would have been loading the large amount of data into memory every time which takes time. Memory usage is the same either way.p  pIf anyone still wants to answer this, Id still be interested, but the method in my first update does not work each future reads in an empty file and uses that to append to. Ill post that code incase it helps anyone thoughdocjure version of the aforementioned tutorialp  precodedef file agent File. blah.xlsx  defn writeout [file workbook]   withopen [out FileOutputStream. file]     .write workbook out   file  defn writeworkbook [file data]   let [filename .getPath file         workbook try loadworkbook filename               catch Exception e createworkbook Sheet1 []         sheet selectsheet Sheet1 workbook]     addrows sheet data     send file writeout workbook  defn test [file]   writeworkbook file [[n m]]   dotimes [i 5]     future writeworkbook file [[i inc i]] codepre  pThanksp

Both solutions below still open many network connections, even if their number is really lower actually both solutions seem to open one connection for 100 HTTP requests, which is still around 200 connections in my case.p  phttplibp  precodeurl        httplocalhost8080fedoraobjectstest1234test urlinfos  urlparseurl conn       httplib.HTTPConnectionurlinfos.hostname    strurlinfos.port  for x in range0, 20000     myurl  url  strx     conn.requestGET, myurl     r  conn.getresponse     responsecontent  r.read     print x, t, myurl, t, r.status codepre  prequestsp  precodeurl  httplocalhost8080fedoraobjectstest1234test s    requests.Session  for x in range0, 20000            myurl  url  strx     r  s.getmyurl     responsecontent  r.content     print x, t, myurl, t, r.statuscode codepre  pEven if the number of connections is much better, ideally Id like to use one or very few connections for all requests.

Besides that I will get complaints about the codesiteurlcode function, thats already claimed by the URL helper.p  pI think the problem is mainly because both CodeIgniter and WordPress use their own unique way of handling Sessions CI in the Database and WordPress in super globals which probably only makes them use the cookie to remember a state.p  pMy whole CodeIgniter system already runs on the Databasedriven Session models so thats an absolute nogo to make a switch. For WordPress it seems it cant even work with session anymore with its code features I know session do work, but that doesnt seem to count in any way for the WP core system.p  pAlso I quoted out codewpunregisterGLOBALScode in the codewpsettings.phpcode file.p  pPlus that I also tried to rename my session COOKIE name in CodeIgniter to use something like codesessioncicodep  pI really hope someone knows a way to being able to tell CodeIgniter or WordPress to only update their values and dont kill the whole session each time. I also read something about splitting up cookies with code.htaccesscode but cant find good resources on it. So if anyone knows how to do that, I would be eternally grateful.p  pIm in despair.

Negative 93851 pI am rewriting a MFC application that has a lot of problems. The main problem is it is unstable.p  pIt is a GUI application that communicates with an external module via USB. So it runs a communication stack every n milliseconds by using a timer. However system calls are not allowed inside timer callbacks so the program is unstable and crashes and hangs a lot because of this.p  pSo I have to rewrite the application to run the communication stack in a background thread. Another problem here is that the data is not completely separated from the presentation and if I use another thread I have to make sure I protect shared resources.p  pSo, mainly, the communication stack will notify the application that there is new data. This should be handled by the worker thread. It runs the communication stack, processes new messages and then locks the data struct while updating it and then it answers back to the module. It then sends a message with PostMessage to the Main thread to update the GUI.p  pBut the user can also tell the application to send data to the external module. This can be done in 3 ways 1. Send data once.  The MAIN thread would then send a message to the worker thread to take a message out of a queue and send it to the module. 2. Send data periodically. This would need to use a timer inside the worker thread or a flag might be enough and it would send data every loop in the thread update function. 3. Send a message to the module and wait for a response. This would require to use a timer to check for timeouts inside the worker thread. On reception of the message the worker thread has to notify the MAIN thread so it can update the GUI with the response.p  pSo Id need to 1. Run the communication stack in a separate thread. The comm stack is a state machine and calling it runs through it once checking for new data. There is no whileloop in it. You can also call a function in its API to send data.p  ol lipSend messages to the MAIN thread to update the GUI when things happen.pli lipSend messages to the worker thread to tell it to send data from the application.pli ol  pSo my questions are 1. MFC uses DocumentView model. I have a hard time figuring out the best way to match this with what I want to do or if I want to partly abandon that skip the document and have my own way of storing the data.   How do I best organize my data Have one big struct that contains all application data and then both the worker and main thread have to lock it when accessing it  When I send a message to the MAIN thread to update the GUI how do I best map the messages to the functions Using the MESSAGEMAP But the message maps are for the windows not the threads I need to be certain only the MAIN thread accesd the GUI. Id need to map each different change in the GUI to a certain function. Thats a lot of messages because there is not one uniform display in the GUI but a lot of different tabs message log, objects, custom messages. p  ol liHow does messages get processed Since the worker thread can access the stack both by running it normally and when the application tells it to send a message I have to finish one call to the stack before a different one is made. If the thread update always finishes what it does before it processes new messages, this is not a problem. Or could I potentially be inside the stack when the timer hits or I get a new message from the MAIN thread and it starts processing the stack as well Maybe I have to lock the stack not only for other threads but to make the sure the worker thread itself does not access it in 2 ways at the same time.li ol

Negative 93851 pLets say that I have a display MOC that is used to display address book contacts that are fetched from a web service. Elsewhere in the app I have a search feature that searches the web service given a query entered by the user, and I fetch and store those objects in a scratchpad MOC so that it doesnt pollute the display fed by the display MOC.p  pNow lets say the user modifies a contact in the scratchpad MOC. Id like to synchronize these changes to any equivalent object in the display MOC, if they exist. I dont want the changed object to be added to the display MOC if it isnt already there, and Id like the change to work the other way too say if the user changes a contact in the display MOC, it should change in the scratchpad MOC, but only if an equivalent object already exists there. I dont want either MOCs to have objects added to them as a result of an object update. Making the scratchpad MOC a child of the display MOC sounds like the wrong solution.p  pWhat is the best pattern to ensure that equivalent objects in different MOCs stay in sync without changing the complement of objects in any other MOCp

I dont want to put byte arrays and bit operations in my code for such a trivial matter, especially with Java.

Negative 93851 pI am trying to create an algorithm that can take a set of objects and organize them in a given area such that a box bounding all of the shapes is optimized either by area used, or by maximizing the span along one of the dimensions, etc.. All of the shapes are closed and bounded.p  pThe purpose of this is to try and minimize material waste from using a laser cutter. The shapes are generated in CAD and can read into this algorithm. The algorithm will then take arguments for the working area effective laser cutting area as well as the minimum separation between any two objects, then attempt to organize the objects within the specified dimensions while trying to minimize the area usage. Alternatively, the algorithm can also try to maximize the object locations along one axis while minimizing the span along the other dimension. This would be akin to cutting off a smaller workpiece to cut from.p  pIdeally, the algorithm would be able to make translations AND rotations, but rotations arent necessary. p  pFor example, a hrefhttpi832.photobucket.comalbumszz248SilntsoldierExample.jpg relnofollowthis Picturea depicts the required transformation.p  pIt should work with an arbitrary, but small lt25 number of objects.p  pLastly, I dont expect anyone to solve this for me, but I would appreciate help toward either finding an algorithm that can do this, or developing my own. Thank you.p

Negative 93851 pI have a codeListenercode class to listen on a particular HTTP port. I made codeListenercode singleton since there will always be a single listener object listening on a particular port.  For this I made strongdefault codeListenercodestrong contructor codeprivatecode. Made codeListenercode instance inside codeListenercode class codestaticcode and have codestatic Listenercode constructor initialize singleton codeListenercode object. Also have codestatic Listener getListenercode which returns singleton codeListenercode instance.p  pI am receiving a SOAP on this port which my listener callback method is processing.p  pNow I want date time of last notification pushed to my UI.p  pSo what I thought is somehow while initializing codeListenercode I will pass a delegate, a reference to which will be stored inside codeListenercode and then every time I receive a notification, inside listener callback I will call that delegate and pass it current time codenew DateTimecode, which will do necessary task of printing message with time. I also thought of making delegate parameter optional so that if delegate is codenullcode it will not be called at all on notification. However since I made constructor private, I am not able to figure it out how I can pass delegate to it.p  pTo summarize and generalize the whole question How to pass a parameter to be stored as a instance member to singleton classp  pShould I pass delegate to codegetListenercode and inside it check everytime if delegate is null and if not, set it But then if I am accessing this singleton object too many times by calling codeListener.getListenercode, everytime it will unnecessarily check the delegate is codenullcode. In fact thats why I moved initializing codeListenercode to static constructor just to avoid checking if codeListenercode is initialized everytime codegetListenercode is called.p  pWhat should I do to pass parameter to singleton class Or this checks in codegetListenercode inevitable p  pstrongNotestrong I dont know but this question may boil down to how can we pass parameters to static constructor since we need to initialize things first time the class is used and we have to initialize it with delegateother programmatic construct thus we cannot load initialization parameters from some config file inside static constructor.p

Negative 93851 pI am getting list of objects in JSON response and I am creating dynamic table rows using javascript function. Table doesnt show all of the values for each record, only few columns. When user selects a record in table I dont want to make a server trip to get all attributes of that record from database hence I have fetched all data initially when getting records to be displayed in table. Now on click of a row I want to get this object and display each attribute in form below the table. p  pMy problem is that how to storebind each record object to respective codelttrgtcode tag and retrieve it on click event as HTML allows to assign only String values to tag attributes. HTML5 allows custom attributes with data prefix and we can access them using codeidOfTag.dataatrributenameafterdatacode but these attributes also accepts only String value.p  pI know this may not be most efficient way as there are some other solutions as  1. Storing record objects in array and assigning only index to respective tag so at the time of retrieval we get index from event source and get corresponding object from array. 2. Using jqGrid to dynamically create tablegrid according to JSON response.p
Negative 93851 pI am using Spring Framework stack, and Im trying to realise the following feature. p  pstrongI want to store in some map, every Feature object returned by Async methods.strong p  pSo far I managed to write an Aspect, registering on such method, but, it does not get the asynchronic Feature proxy, but it gets already the result of this method  value returned when method finishes. So aspect AfterReturning registers not for returning a proxy, but real value after method finish. So far I have discovered that if I would have another object, which just executes my Async method, and forwards the resulting Feature, then registering for that Future, gets the Future proxy I want. But its a troublesome solution to have another objects which proxies calls to every async method. p  precodeComponent public class Sample      Async     MyAnnotation     public FutureltIntegergt run           long running operation         return new AsyncResult10        Component Aspect public class SampleAspect    AfterReturningpointcut  annotationmyAnnotation , returning  retVal     public Object processObject retVal, String reqId, MyAnnotation myAnnotation  throws Throwable           method execution has already finished here          retval is instanceof AsyncResult, I want it to be a Future proxy         return retVal       codepre  pWorkaround requiring additional objectp  precodeComponent public class OtherSample      Autowired Sample sample      OtherAnnotation     public FutgureltIntegergt run          return sample.run         Component Aspect public class OtherAspect    AfterReturningpointcut  annotationotherAnnotation, returning  retVal     public Object processObject retVal, String reqId, OtherAnnotation otherAnnotation  throws Throwable           method execution has NOT finished here          retval is instanceof Future proxy         return retVal       codepre

Negative 93851 pIm doing sequence alignment, and have run into a rather mysterious timing issue related to the origin of my dict data structure.  Basically, I have function codealignments1, s2, scorescode which takes in two string s1 and s2, and a scoring matrix as a python dict for each possible pair of 20 amino acids and a gap . So codescorescode has 440 keys char1, char2, with integer values.p  pHere is the mystery If I read codescorescode from a text file call it scores1 and run      codealignments1, s2, scores1code for some 1000ish long strings s1, s2 of amino acids I get the following timing using cProfile and not showing the function outputp  pcode2537776 function calls in 11.796 secondscodep  pNow if I create the exactly same dict in my file call it scores2 and run      codealignments1, s2, scores2code  I get the same output results but in 3 times less timep  pcode2537776 function calls in 4.263 secondscodep  pThe output in both cases is identical, it is just the timing that is different.  Running codeprint scores1  scores2code results in codeTruecode, so they contain identical information. I verified that using an arbitrary function instead of alignment that accesses the dict  many times yields the same factor of 3 timing discrepancy in the two cases. p  pThere must be some metadata related to where the dicts originated from that is slowing down my function when from a file, even though in both cases I actually read in the file.

Negative 93851 pIm working on a project involving a memory analysis tool for Java. The tool works on class files and gives an upper bound for memory consumption for a given class. Currently, the tool isnt perfect, for example in the following codep  precodeclass Example      public Object o      public Example          o  new Object       codepre  pThe space required by the Object o is counted double, because of the instantiation in the constructor. Currently, the user is required to manually remove the classwide object instantiations from the constructor in order to get a more accurate upper bound of memory required. p  pSince we dont have the possibility to make changes to the analysis tool, wed like to automate the process of stripping the object instantiations from constructors.

Negative 93851 pI am having some problems with android and iText if someone could help please.p  pThe android app writes multiple pages, each containing different tables. Rather than allowing a table to cross over a page I add a table for each page and create a new table for the next page. That way I retain control over page totals and headers and footers.p  pThe problem I have is that the Android adobe pdf reader display the document fine, exactly was I was looking for. However when I open a window on my pc to access the mntsdcard folder on the tablet, where the file is created, and open the document with the Adobe reader on my pc, adobe reader X, the get a message saying there was an error opening this document. The file is damaged and could not be repaired.p  pThis is highly frustrating and I am certain the the correct number of columns are being added to the tables. I do use colspan and rowspan quite a bit. Not sure whether that has something to do with it. If I skip the main section of the document it seems to work fine.p  pAre there known issues with iText and Adobe X. p  pI dont finalise the tables at all, just use document.addtable, but I do close the document. doc.close.p  pI have also tried copying to my desktop but no differencep  pThanks for any helpp  pPetep  hr  pI have tried to reopen the document with iText PDFReader class and get the following error.p  precodeRebuild failed trailer not found. Original message PDF startxref not found. codepre  pAfter investigation it appears that the output stream maybe being closed too early, although why it should display in tablet Im not sure. Maybe it concatenates the documents somehow. The stream is opened as shown p  precodeDocument document  new DocumentPageSize.A4.rotate PdfWriter.getInstancedocument, new FileOutputStreamConst.PDFPATHFILE document.open document.addTitlePilot Flight Logbook document.addSubjectLog of all Flights document.addKeywordsJava, PDF, iText document.addAuthorProPilot document.addCreatorProPilot codepre  pDoes this seem to be the correct track. If so how can I stop the stream closing automaticallyp
Negative 93851 pI had basic and premium versions of my app installed on one of my test phones. I then updated the firmware to iOS 7.1 Beta 5. p  pThe basic and premium versions have identical binaries certain features are just switched on or off, but after upgrading, the premium version crashes on launch but not the basic version. I can run the pro version from xcode and see its crashing because it cant find the model for the persistent store  cocoa error 134130 though the check to whether  exists at the appropriate location returns true. I can run fresh installs of both versions of the app on the 7.1 simulator with no problems.p  pIm not sure whether this is something related to the beta, or if I had a debug version of the premium app on the phone previously and that caused some problem after upgrading.p  pId like to be sure by doing some testing around installing it on 7.0, configuring it various ways, then upgrading to 7.1 and seeing there are any problems. But Im not sure how to do this. If I run it on the simulator, then switch the simulator to 7.1, it doesnt preserve the apps. It wont let me restore back to a previous version for my test phone I do have my personal phone running iOS 7 and I could test the upgrade on there, but without the ability to restore I could only run one test.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 93851 pIm trying to send images to my node.js server hosted on Heroku to an S3 bucket on AWS while also saving a thumbnail of the image in a hosted mongoDB at mongoLab.

I have a python script that take a photo and send the PUT request to my server with the relevant request details, including a codebase64code encoded string containing the image.p  pThe error my current code receives is a timeout error from Heroku. Im fairly certain this is due to a lack of response from AWS due to an incorrectly formatted buffer. p  pIve run into similar issues seen at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15817746streamuploadingangmresizedimagetos3withawssdkthis stack overflow questiona.p  pFrom here, Im not sure how to get the buffer moved.

Only the visible number of rows is loaded initially and the rest is pulled async as user scrolls up and down the table.p  pI am interested in some objc code or tips on how to code this.

Negative 93851 pIm new to javascript and canvas, but not entirely new to programming I have some HTMLPHP experience. p  pIve always had an interest in web games that use grids, so after taking a few javascript courses online, I found some javascript code that dynamically created hexagonal grids of canvas objects.p  pIve been playing around with the code, adding click events to highlight the hex youre on, trying to put random numbers on the hexes to depict numbers of units etc. Sort of mocking up what a game might look like, just for the learning experience.p  pOne thing that Ive been trying to do, and I cant seem to figure out, is how to define canvas objects in an array, so that I can reference them by rowcolumn. It seems like it would be much easier, in the context of a game, to reference a grid cell by rowcolumn so that you can do actions based on that location.  p  pIm using ocanvas.js to create canvas objects, so ideally Id love to be able to define a grid cell asp  precodehex[row][col]  canvas.display.polygon     x x0,     y y0,     sides 6,     radius this.radius,     rotation 0,     fill fillColor,     stroke outside 1px 000,     row row,     col col,     zIndex back,     selected false  hex[row][col].add     codepre  pHowever, Ive noticed that mutlidimensional arrays dont work in javascript like they do in PHP.   In PHP, you dont have to predefine the scope of an array.  You can just dop  precodearray  [] array[1][5]  foo codepre  pAnd itll put that value in the [1][5] position.   In my hex code here a hrefhttptny.cz14282e49 relnofollowhttptny.cz14282e49a  about 34 down I have a comment showing that I want to call my hex[col][row] object... but Im always getting Uncaught TypeError Cannot read property 5 of undefined errors, where 5 is the column its trying to access.p  pSo, this is a 2 part question 1 Am I not defining my codehexcode array correctly to access the canvas objects like that 2 Is there a better way that Im just not seeing, to access specific canvas objects in a columnrow grid formatp

Negative 93851 pIve been trying to learn how to properly unittest and set up unit tests for all of my code on a new project. The project Im currently doing this for requires me running a lot of actions against Google BigQuery i.e. create tables, insert, query, delete. Im feeling like I cant truly test all of this functionality by mocking BigQuery because the actions I do against it are complicated and interdependent, and if theres a break in the middle somewhere, I want to catch it. Is it generally frowned upon to have something like an environment variable that specifies a test account built into my unit tests so they actually run against the remote service This feels like the best way to truly test everything and hit tests that I couldnt hit with a mock. So, is this something people do Are there some major downsides to doing things this way p

Negative 93851 pI have a requirement in my MVC4 App where i need to upload some files on dropbox.  Please suggest me any Api which is good and have some good code samples.  I have tried the API a hrefhttpcgeers.com20120317dropboxrestapipart6oauthcallback5b relnofollowhttpcgeers.com20120317dropboxrestapipart6oauthcallback[a] but it is giving some error. There are many samples but they are for Asp.Net. p  pPlease suggest the approach i can follow and some good APIs to integrate DropBox in MVC 4 App.p  pEDIT The requirement is like I have a page with an option to login to Dropbox. When user clicks Login, a new tab or popup should open where user is asked to allow or deny DropBox. If user allows, it is redirected to login page. After user logins in Dropbox, the tab or popup closes or redirect back to main site. After this the uploading will be done in background. p  pHow can i achieve the whole scenariop  pI thought of opening a view in popup when user clicks on option to login to Dropbox. When user will either allow or deny, it will navigate to a callback URL of a view. this will call action method in my controller. Here i can identify if parameters appended in URL are emptynull or contain some value. If it contains some value, it means user has allowed. Also, when user clicks on option to login to Dropbox, I will initiate a timer in my controller, which will call a DropBox method every few seconds to know if the credentials are authenticated. Once it come to know that credentials are authenticated, timer will be stopped. Timer will run only for 5 minutes. at the same time, i will close popup. Also, i need to change the text of that Login button where user clicks to start this process when user allows DropBox. but i dont know how to do it.p  pPlease let me know if this approach is Okay.p  pThanks.p

Negative 93851 pI am attempting to learn how to use the Android NavigationDrawer and I created a small demo app by copying the code seen here a hrefhttpsgithub.comjavatechigAndroidNavigationDrawer relnofollowhttpsgithub.comjavatechigAndroidNavigationDrawera. I was able to successfully compile the code and run the app, but whenever I select one of the choices in the NavigationDrawer to open up a webpage in the WebView, I see nothing within the Webview. My logcat is showing no errors, but I am receiving a message that saysp  precodeWAwContents nativeOnDraw failed clearing to background color codepre  pI have attempted the solutions proposed in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20675554webviewrenderingissueinandroidkitkatthis question herea, but none of them have seemed to resolve my issue. If somebody could help me figure out how to get these web pages to appear in the WebView, that would much appreciated.p  pEdit FYI, my project SDK is the Android API 19 Platform and I am working in JetBrains IntelliJ community edition.p

Is this true Excel needs to be opened in order for the data to be populatedrefreshedp  pNow, if I want to program an auto exportcreate to PDF, is this possible Do I need to manually open the excel file  wait for Excel to connect with SQL and getrefresh data  save as .pdfp  pMaybe someone can be kind enough to explain how Excel lt SQL connection work after opening the file in excel and wo opening the file in excel.p  pThank youp

Negative 93851 pIm working on a 60fps racing game on iOS. The game is controlled by 2 thumbs, left and right. Right is used for steering sliding the finger with touchesMoved and left is a hold and release for boost hold for about a second then release. p  pOnce in a while, I get the bug where the left touch doesnt register at all... I dont get touchesBegan, touchesMoved, touchEnded or TouchesCancelled when I touch, move or release the left finger. However, if I release the right finger  the steering finger when the left hand touch is still there and the bug is happinging no left finger events called, I get touchCancelled for the right finger touch ... very weird p  p95 of the time, everything goes normal, and both leftright generate the events on time as expected. The bug happens only about 5 of the time, and very randomly.p  pHere is the scenario of the bug in detailed stepsp  p1 Right finger is already touching on the rightbottom corner and its steering the game with TouchesMoved. p  p2 Left finger touches the leftbottom corner but no TouchesBegan called when the touch happens. p  p3 Right finger moving still registers TouchesMoved calls properly as expected. p  p4 Left finger moving doesnt register anything as if it doesnt exist.p  p5A Removing the left finger first doesnt register TouchesEnded or TouchesCancelled. Removing right finger afterwards registers TouchesEnded normally as expected. p  por p  p5B Removing the right finger first causes TouchesCancelled to be called. Afterwards, removing left finger does nothing as if there was no touch there. p  pI have one fullscreen UIView that uses OpenGL. Multitouch is enabled for both the view and the window, and no Gestures are registered unless if there are some default onesp  pIm testing on iOs 7.1.1 on iPhone5. p  pI also noticed that CPU load doesnt make a difference, sometime I get the bug when CPU load is high sometimes when its low, also no memory warning or memory overloading. p  pHopefully someone with deep iOS experience can resolve this mystery.p

Negative 93851 pI have to work with 3rd party tool that connected on different DBsServers to collect some data and do some work. It is not important what this app do just note that it connects to codeServer1DB1code and codeServer2DB2code on codeDomain1code. Both servers use ONLY Windows Authentication i.e. client have to connected with codeIntegratedSecuritytruecode. This approach works pretty well in codeDomain1code. But one day we decided to move this app working on another domain business reasons. We created mirror of codeServer1DB1code on another domain let call it codeServer1IOtherDomainDB1code. Currently this app can work with Scodeerver1OtherDomainDB1code because I run it as user of new domain and it seems everything OK. We just need support fresh version of DB on our environment. However few days ago we have recognized that connection string to codeServer2DB2code is hardcoded and we cant do the same with codeServer2DB2code to create mirror on our codeOtherDomaincode. Obviously, some part of functionality is not working just because it cant reach codeServer2DB2code in codeDomain1code.

Negative 93851 pIm reading the book C Templates The Complete Guide by Addison Wesley, and have a question about specializations of class templates.

Would a client need to know that there are two definitions, maybe in to different header files, and then know which one to include based on the type T given to the Stack class It seems to me that you would be better of just implementing two different classes for in this scenario, one general Stack class and a specialized StackString class.p  pThoughtsp

Im after a fluffy cloud style pattern, like perlin noise generates.p  pMy goal is to have a single function that when supplied seedxy values it gives the desired 2D output.p  pPrecomputing an array of values which is the method Ive found in several places on Google is out of the question here. The noise is to be used for procedural world generation, and the 2D input coordinates can go from 1,088,391,168 to 1,088,391,168 for both x amp y axis, which would be 41018 bytes... so the output has to depend directly on the input values given and calculated onthefly.p  hr  pMy question is given two seperate axis of 1D noise x axisy axis how can I combine the two axis into a single 2D noise value Or in other words, how can I combine my horizontal and vertical barcodes together to create a 2D noise fieldp  hr  pEDITp  precodeconst double noisex1  Noiseseed, x const double noisex2  Noiseseed, x  1  const double noisey1  Noiseseed  1, y const double noisey2  Noiseseed  1, y  1 codepre  pThis gets the noise values for the xy axis, and the noise values for the next xy point.

Negative 93851 pI am currently making a login system for my mobile application. When i log in to my server, mu server sends back a JSESSIONID, which i can use to authenticate myself for furthers calls. The problem I am experiencing here is that PhoneGap seems to automatically save this cookie without me asking to. This way, i cant provide a log out feature since PhoneGap is saving the cookie and always sending it back to de server in each call I make.... Im using codexmlhttpcode requests. I either want a way to delete this cookie, or a way to disable PhoneGap from saving the cookie in the first place, and handle the sessioncookie myself. Ive been looking to find this cookie but i cant seem to find it.  Anyone got an idea on how to solve this problemp

Negative 93851 pThe project is a calculator that displays the math operations in a listbox i.e. the listbox would show something like 123.  The calculator is completely functional and working correctly.  Now here is the problem.  I have been asked to extend the functionality of the calculator to be able to modify listbox entries when selected. When a listbox item is selected I need to populate two textboxes with the two numbers in the math operation.  So if I selected 123 then I would have to populate the first textbox with 1 and the second with 2 so that they can be modified.  I am assuming this needs to be done using regex, but I have zero experience with it and just cant get my head around this one issue. p

Negative 93851 pI have created a new AngularJS application that calls some legacy code from a Perl program. The Perl app opens widgets in a modal box. The legacy application uses a different version of jQuery 1.8.1min than the AngularJS 1.11.x. When the legacy code is called, the button images remain undefined and also the onClick related codes on buttons. p  pI assume that the jQuery version mismatch causes it to ignore the script tag from the widget. p  pPlease let me know what is the best way to achieve this.p
Negative 93851 pIm doing some planning for replacing an existing solution with mongodb and potentially using the GridFS functionality for static assets. One question that I have is if I choose to front GridFS with nginx, is there a way to control which assets in a collection may be served directly from nginx versus which asset requests need to be directed to my applicationp  pThe reason I ask is that some security checks are done for certain assets and those assets have always been served out of the app itself and will need to continue to be, at least for now.p  pI was thinking, I could probably just add a property on the file descriptors stored in nginx that is something like codeisPublishedcode. Could I instruct nginxgridfs to respect this propertyp

Negative 93851 pim confused about TCP connection through firewall. Source Portclient is 12345 and dest portserver is 1433. At the begining, client successfully sends the request to server from 12345 to 1433. When server sending back, does the client require to open port 12345 in Firewall  If yes, its hard to configure all ports since source port is dynamic. p  pBest Regards, Tomp

Negative 93851 pI finally found the right answer to solve the problem of the files not visible from PC on the Nexus 7, because of the buggy this bug was pointed out back in 2012 and not solved by Google yet look at a hrefhttpscode.google.compandroidissuesdetailid38282 relnofollowthisa MTP protocol in Android. Just use the codeMediaScannerConnection.scanFile...code as explained in other posts and replies to other SO questions. As explained in the mentioned replies, the codescanFilecode should be called after file close... My problem is that I want to log what my app is doing on a file.log which should be closed when the app is closed when swiping away from the recent apps list by long home button press, to be clear.   p  pstrongFirst problemstrong Ive tested that the codeMediaScannerConnection.scanFilecode solution updates the content of a directory but it is not repeatable to reach my goal, i.e. if you want to keep your PC view updated to whats happening on the device you cannot simply have a repetitive call to this function, because it will not update the file properties and, the most important part, its content     p  pstrongSimplest workaroundstrong I could call the MediaScanner only when the app is definitely closed at least from the user stand point, forcing the user to close the app in a clean way, but beeing sure to logg all the necessary information. The question is which is the perfect point to place it I couldnt find a function that is called when the app is swipeclosed. The codeonStopcode method of the main activity is not the right place since the app can then easily recalled from the recent apps list, while the codeonDestroycode is not completely under control, since it is called by the OS when it needs to free memory....   p  pShould I give up or do you have any working solution for this Or should I simply accept I cannot log eveything till the app is permanently closed  Thanks for any helpp

The Blog tablet hold the blog, the asset table holds the assets and the Assetlink table links the two together.p  pcodetblBlog.BIDcode is the PK in blog, codetblAssets.AIDcode is the PK in Assets.p  pThis query works but pulls back multiple posts for the same record. Ive tried to use select distinct and group by and even union but as my knowledge is pretty poor with SQL  they all error.p  pId like to also discount any assets that are marked as deleted tblAssets.Deleted  true but not hide the associated Blog post if thats not marked as deleted. If anyone can help  it would be much appreciated Thanks.p  pHeres my query so far....  p  precodeSELECT dbo.tblBlog.BID,        dbo.tblBlog.DateAdded,        dbo.tblBlog.PMonthName,        dbo.tblBlog.PDay,        dbo.tblBlog.Header,        dbo.tblBlog.AddedBy,        dbo.tblBlog.PContent,        dbo.tblBlog.Category,        dbo.tblBlog.Deleted,        dbo.tblBlog.Intro,        dbo.tblBlog.Tags,        dbo.tblAssets.Name,        dbo.tblAssets.Description,        dbo.tblAssets.Location,        dbo.tblAssets.Deleted AS Expr1,        dbo.tblAssetLink.Priority FROM   dbo.tblBlog        LEFT OUTER JOIN dbo.tblAssetLink          ON dbo.tblBlog.BID  dbo.tblAssetLink.BID        LEFT OUTER JOIN dbo.tblAssets          ON dbo.tblAssetLink.AID  dbo.tblAssets.AID WHERE   dbo.tblBlog.Deleted  False   ORDER  BY dbo.tblAssetLink.Priority, tblBlog.DateAdded DESC  codepre  pemEDITemp  pChanged the codeWherecode and the codeorder bycode....p  pExpected outputp  precodetblBlog.BID  123  tblBlog.DateAdded  12042015  tblBlog.Header  This is a header  tblBlog.AddedBy  Persons name  tblBlog.PContent  text  tblBlog.Category  Category name  tblBlog.Deleted  False  tblBlog.Intro  text  tblBlog.Tags  Tag, Tag, Tag  tblAssets.Name  some.jpg  tblAssets.Description  Asset desc  tblAssets.Location  Location name  tblAssets.Priority  True codepre

Negative 93851 pI am desperately trying to find a source of historical data for various commodities. I dont need charts, I need values  for example closing price of Corn Jul 15 CN15.CBT for the last month. Ive tried it on Yahoo Finance, but theres nothing there, no historical data. Then I found out about Yahoo Finance API and tried to use that a hrefhttpwww.jarloo.comyahoofinance relnofollowhttpwww.jarloo.comyahoofinancea  But no luck either. So the best solution for me would be to know the code to use for Yahoo Finance API to get historical data for commodities from it. But if you could direct me to a website where I could get the values for every day of the last few months for a certain commodity that would be great too. Is anybody able to help, pleasep  pThank youp  pPetrp

Negative 93851 pIm using the latest version of the NDK as of a few weeks ago, r10d, and using the build tools to build python and some extensions in python.  Using the build tools, I create a shared object that then gets linked into my project in Android Studio.  In my build environment outside of Android studio, where I build the embedded Python library, I use the latest platform automatically, so in this case it is using NDKROOTplatformsandroid21.p  pAll built fine, but then it crashed on a device running 4.4.4 with the error java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError dlopen failed cannot locate symbol epollcreate1 referenced by libMyNativeIntfc.so...p  pSo, doing some research, I see that one of my python extensions uses this method, and it is defined in the NDKs sysepoll.h.  However, it was added to bionic in platform android21 Im surprised I havent encountered this already as Ive been building since API 16.  In previous platform libraries, the method is not exported.  So I believe this method was just added to the latest android21 libc I verified it exists in the android21 libc.a library and headers but not android19 and below.p  pIm looking for a bit of advice for the best way forward.  As it stands, I think there are a couple of options. 1 Build against android20 NDK platform instead, in which case my configure scripts will cull out the use of the method in my extension, and all will be happy. 2 Change the extension code to call epollcreate instead, but I really would like to keep it the same as the upstream repo. 3 Link against the static libc.a in the android21 usrlib directory...now this one Im a bit wary of.  Would this be okayp  pThanks, Chrisp

Not all strings in the set appear in the tree. We stop searching when we find all strings. We need to run this search several times but the trees may differ each time. The set of strings to search is the same each run though.p  pCurrently were using depthfirst search, but this isnt very efficient if all strings fall under say the last branch under the root. I feel like there should be a better way of doing this.p  pWhat would be a good algorithm for doing this repeated search Would it be possible to leverage multithreading here as wellp

Negative 93851 pI wonder how to decode a threedimensional dynamic array of a custom type written to a binary file in VB6.p  pThe custom type is defined as followsp  precodeType XYByte     X As Byte     Y As Byte End Type codepre  pIt represents two coordinates of a contact point.p  pThe threedimensional array represents precomputed contact point positions for a minigolf track relief. The track is viewed as a twodimensional height map. For each possible ball position on the map, contact points are computed that there can be more for a map coordinate, so hence the third dimension.p  precodeDim ContactPointMap As XYByte ReDim ContactPointMapWidth  1, Height  1, MaxContactPointCount  1 codepre  pThat array gets saved into a binary file that includes that track shape.p  precodeOpen FileName For Binary As 1 ... Put 1, , ContactPointMap ... Close 1 codepre  pOK, this is how I did it in VB6. Now I rewrite the minigolf simulator in FPCLazarus and wonder how to decipher the threedimensional array data witten by VB6.p  pIts interesting that its pretty straightforward to read a twodimensional array of Single precision float values that I use as the relief map itself and as a source for contact point calculationp  precodeDim Map As Single ReDim MapWidth  1, Height  1 codepre  pThe data is saved in a logical order. I can recognize rows and columns and the reading goes well.p  pBut by that threedimensional contact point map, every try to read it fails. I used a hexeditor to see the binary data and its stored in a way that I cant understand.p  pOK, I already can read the relief map and as a backup option, I can recompute the contact points in FPC, change the format and save the contact point map in a noncryptic way. BTW, I stored that information in the track files only for speed reasons it was faster to read that array on play time than to calculate it.p  pI no longer have access to VB6. I only have the code and the compiled executable.p  pBut does anyone know how would I basically decipher a threedimensional dynamic array of userdefined type written by VisualBasic 6p

Negative 93851 pI am creating a toy website with rails that uses the Yelp and Google driving direction APIs. The idea is that a user can enter their driving directions and the website will tell them the best rated Yelp places to eat along their route. p  pCurrently my Google API code sits in the controllers javascript file, generating the driving directions and specific latitude and longitude coordinates at specific intervals along the route. I am trying to use jQueryAjax to POST the coordinates to a custom controller action, which then calls a Yelp function in the model where I query the Yelp API to identify the restaurants along the route. These are my questionsissuesp  ol liWhat is the best way to send the coordinates generated from the Google maps API to the backend li ol  pI was trying to use AJAXjQuery but Im getting a 500 internal server error. The console says the error is occurring in this line codexhr.send  options.hasContent ampamp options.data   null code My googling research suggests that this problem is due to me making a crossdomain ajax request. Im guessing this means that AJAXjQuery is not the preferred method, but is there an easy workaround for this problemp  pAnother idea I had for sending the coordinates was creating a hidden form in the view. Then once the Google API generates the coordinates, I enter the coordinates as the value in the input field and submit the form, saving the coordinates in my rails model. Is this method possible p  ol start2 liDo I need to use rails with this project, or can I do everything on the frontend I assumed I needed to use a server side framework because Yelp uses Oath, requiring users to enter their secret key, token, etc. The code samples in the Yelp documentation all lead to server side languages. Is there a way to hide that secret information and do everything on the front end li ol  pThanks. p
Negative 93851 pI am trying to make a subway app which finds the shortest path from station to station.p  pI tried Dijkstra algorithm with several samples of heap to actually calculate the best route everytime the user selects starting station and ending station.p  pBut I am wondering if it would be better to store all possible routes in Core Data, so the app doesnt have to calculate the best route each time, but rather fetch the best route information from Core Datap  pThere are 624 stations. and 624 X 624  389,376 existing paths from any station to any station.p  pThe piece of information for EACH possible route would hold something likep  precode starting station  String  end station  String  stations inbetween  String   total time it takes in seconds  Double  number of transfers  Int etc.  codepre  pMy main question is  strongAssuming I already have 389,376 data, would it take too much disk memory if id stored all 400,00 some data in Core Data or would it be just a trivial problem.strongp  pI am trying to avoid using Dijkstra because its taking quite a lot of time to take into account transfer time, transfer preference, etc. p
Negative 93851 pIm trying to improve our crypto performance. We need to stream encrypted video, so we encrypt each frame h.264 NALU, to be precise and send it over network. We cant eventr stream PAL video on Android this way.p  pWe are using AES codeAESCBCPKCS7Paddingcode, and we use the same key and IV for each frame in session. I know, its not very secure, but I was not there when this was implemented and its too late to change that. So, for each frame we call codeCipher.initcode with same parameters key and IV and then just call codedoFinalcode. Is it somehow possible to prevent this and reuse already initialized codeCiphercode objectp  pOr is there some better algorithm for video streams than AES We are using SpongyCastle. Is there something faster Or should we rewrite it in NDK using OpenSSLp

I wanted to also implement a digraph using jgrapht, each 1 being a vertex, and having one edge being created between two 1s which are next to each other. So each time the algorithm turns a 1 into a 3, it makes both the 3 a vertex and creates an edge with the last spot filled. p  pNote I use reactivision, so each marker detected is added to the matrix as a 1. Since I cant test right now with 10 markers, I added a matrix to the program. p  pHere is the part of my code doing this [EDIT] I pasted my whole code now since I cant find the error p  precode  import TUIO. import java.util.  import java.util.List import java.util.Arrays import java.util.Scanner import java.io. import org.joda.time.DateTime import org.jgrapht.alg. import org.jgrapht.demo. import java.net. import org.jgrapht. import org.jgrapht.graph. import org.jgrapht.graph.DefaultEdge import org.jgrapht.alg.

Needless to say this results in a frozen UI and if closed, the entire application remains in memory until killed by the task manager. Given a few minutes the call to serialclose will finally return what I would like to know is whats wrong and how can I best avoid a hanging UIp  pI have looked into the code of QSerialPort and I cant see anything manifestly wrong. If I call codeserialgterrorCodecode I get the UknownError string but that happens even when the port closes with no hangups.p  pstrongEDITstrong This NEVER happens in the debugger. The SerialPort always closes immediately and the destructor sails through with no hangups on QThreadwaitp  pstrongEDITstrong I am certain it is the serialclose which is hanging because I can see the qDebug statement being printed just before it hangs for several seconds or minutes. p  pThe device stops transmitting because in the dconnect switch, a disconnect packet is sent and a LED on the device turns green. p

Put another way, referring to df1 above, in the foo item group, anything between the values of 999 and 1102 are a part of the apple group, and anything above 1103 would be part of the bird group.p  pAlso, codeitemcode needs to match between dataframes.  In other words, a codesizecode entry from df2 that is classified as a foo codeitemcode should only be compared to foos in df1.  p  pMy desired output is something likep  precode  item   name  size  total 0  foo  apple  1076      5 1  foo   bird  1266     10 2  bar   bird  1380      5 3  qux    NaN  1620     13 codepre  pDoes anyone have any ideas on how I might approach this problem p  pOne approach I could take would be to codepd.concatcode the dataframes, then sort on code[item, value]code, then codeffillcode the codenamecode column, then filter where codesizecode is not null.  But the problem would be that in some cases I would be forward filling across codeitemcode groups, which would lead to spurious results.p

Negative 93851 pI have a pipeline which reads from Pubsub topicswindowed by the minute and writes the processed results to BigQuery. I would like to have the tables sharded by time as well as some key from the data itself. BigQueryIO does provide options to shard by the window timestamp but I dont think it provides any option to shard the tables by some key from the input collection itself. If I missed some alternative for this, please let me know.p  pTo overcome this problem, Option 1 I chose to shard the source Pubsub topic itself by the same key and so, setup the pipeline to read from multiple sources and process them along separate branches and writing each branch results to BigQuery partitioned by the window timestamp which seems to work. What I would like to know is since the intermediate processing step in Dataflow can be agnostic of the source or the sink in my case, Option 2 would it make the pipeline more efficient in terms of resources and time if I continued using a single Pubsub topic and add an extra transform before the BigQuery write step to partition the collections and then write to BigQuery. p  pOption  1  Incurs lesser load on Pubsub duringboth readwrite since even the combined message might fit into a few hundred KBs  Read Step amp Intermediate processing is done in separate pipelines which might not inefficient for Dataflowp  pOption  2  The pipeline is cleaner  Additional step to partition which also reads the same collection as many times as the number of partitions we have  but the number of collection items and the partitions themselves are pretty small  so, this should not be a bigger problemp  pI guess Option 2 makes more sense while reading through a hrefhttpscloud.google.comdataflowpipelinesdesignprincipleshlen relnofollowPipeline Design Principlesa but I still want to clarify what I am doing is right.p
