Positive 13139 pI have a work assignment which isp  pCreate a subclass of JPanel, named RegularPolygonPanel, to paint an nsided regular polygon. The class contains a property named numberOfSides, which specifies the number of sides in the polygon. The polygon is centered at the center of the panel.

Positive 13139 pmy task is to program a game with code128128 pxcode. So I started to prepare the Game Java Framework and everything is fine Ive got a codeJFramecode and inside of it is a Canvas where I can draw. But I cant set the sizes correctly. I stronghave tostrong work with code128128 pxcode but if the frame would be the same size it would be way too small so I need to scale it up. p  pBut If I scale the size of the Frame up, the Canvas is too small and doesnt fill it anymore. If Id simply give it the same size as the Frame then I wouldnt work with code128128 pxcode anymore. So how can I draw everything like normal onto my small canvas and scale it up afterwardsp  precodepackage de.gaminggears.communitygame  import java.awt.Color import java.awt.Graphics import java.awt.Graphics2D import java.awt.image.BufferStrategy  import de.gaminggears.communitygame.display.Display  public class Game implements Runnable  private Display display public int width, height public String title  private boolean running  false private Thread thread  private BufferStrategy bs private Graphics g   public GameString title,int width, int height     this.height  height     this.width  width     this.title  title    private void init     display  new Displaytitle, width, height   private void tick    private void render     bs  display.getCanvas.getBufferStrategy     ifbs  null         display.getCanvas.createBufferStrategy3         return          g  bs.getDrawGraphics     Graphics2D g2d  Graphics2D g     Clear Screen     g2d.clearRect0, 0, width, height     Draw Here      g2d.setColorColor.RED     g2d.fillRect10, 50, 50, 70     g2d.fillRect0, 0, 10, 10      End Drawing      g2d.scale5, 5     bs.show     g.dispose   public void run      init      whilerunning         tick         render          stop    public synchronized void start     ifrunning         return     running  true     thread  new Threadthis     thread.start   public synchronized void stop     ifrunning         return     running  false     try          thread.join      catch InterruptedException e          e.printStackTrace         codepre

Positive 13139 pI am trying to make a program where one button leads to the extension of the jframe, and then if the user wants to get back to the jframe he is able to do that by pressing another button. So codeframe.disposecode is what I use to exit this page of the program, and then  codematicnaploca matplo new maticnaploca  matplo.setVisibletruecode to get to the extension, where maticnaploca is the name of the class which is the extension of the jframe. I now want to exit this extension and return to the jframe. How to do thatp
Positive 13139 pHere is some of my code. It should be noted that this is not my exact code as I did have much more added, but long story short, I can guarantee that none of the controls touch each other, and that they are all added to this frame. Where then is my problem. It should be noted that I am not highly experienced with this, and as such need specific help. I dont see why these are giving me problems, such as buttons being too big and out of place, but I need them in the exact location which I specify at the exact size, and never disappearing or flickering.

Here is the ActionButtons classp  precodeimport java.awt.GridLayout import java.awt.event.ActionEvent import java.awt.event.ActionListener  import javax.swing.BorderFactory import javax.swing.JButton import javax.swing.JPanel   SuppressWarningsserial public class ActionButtons extends JPanel private JButton calc, reset, exit private JPanel actionButtons public ActionButtons     PaymentInformation pi  new PaymentInformation     actionButtons  new JPanelnew GridLayout1, 3, 20, 20     calc  new JButtonCalculate     reset  new JButtonReset     exit  new JButtonExit     actionButtons.addcalc     actionButtons.addreset     actionButtons.addexit     actionButtons.setBorderBorderFactory.createTitledBorderAction Buttons      Add ActionListeners     calc.addActionListenernew ButtonListener     reset.addActionListenernew ButtonListener     exit.addActionListenernew ButtonListener    public JPanel getGUI     return actionButtons     private class ButtonListener implements ActionListener     public void actionPerformedActionEvent e          PaymentInformation pi  new PaymentInformation         ife.getActionCommand.equalsExit             System.exit0                  ife.getActionCommand.equalsReset             pi.changeValues0.0                  ife.getActionCommand.equalsCalculate             TODO DO CALCULATIONS                      codepre  pAnd the PaymentInformation classp  precodeimport java.awt.GridLayout  import javax.swing.BorderFactory import javax.swing.JLabel import javax.swing.JPanel    SuppressWarningsserial  public class PaymentInformation extends JPanel Declare variables private JPanel payInfo private JLabel loanAmt, monthPay, totalPay, loanVal, monthVal, totalVal  public PaymentInformation     Give panel layout     payInfo  new JPanelnew GridLayout3, 2     Give titles, set alignment     loanAmt  new JLabelTotal Loan Amount  , JLabel.LEFT     monthPay  new JLabelMonthly Payment  , JLabel.LEFT     totalPay  new JLabelTotal Payment  , JLabel.LEFT     loanVal  new JLabel5.0, JLabel.RIGHT     monthVal  new JLabel0.0, JLabel.RIGHT     totalVal  new JLabel0.0, JLabel.RIGHT     Add stuff to JPanel     payInfo.addloanAmt     payInfo.addloanVal     payInfo.addmonthPay     payInfo.addmonthVal     payInfo.addtotalPay     payInfo.addtotalVal     Set border     payInfo.setBorderBorderFactory.createTitledBorderPayment Information  Method to get the JPanel public JPanel getGUI     return payInfo   public void changeValuesString val     loanVal.setTextval    codepre  pIm trying to use the setValue method in PaymentInformation to change the text of the JLabel, but it stays the same at 5.0 when the reset button is clicked.

The exporting process works for that already as well.p

Negative 13139 pI am looking for a python webserver which is multithreaded instead of being multiprocess as in case of modpython for apache. I want it to be multithreaded because I want to have an in memory object cache that will be used by various http threads.

Using something like Qts codeQStringcode or the ICU String class seems to be right, but I wonder whether there is a more lightweight approach i.e. if my codecharcode strings are ANSI encoded, and the subset of ANSI that is used is equal to UFT8, then I can easily treat the data as UTF8 and provide converters fromto UTF8, and Im done, as I can store it in codestdstringcode, unless there are problems with this approach.p

Negative 13139 pIs performance the only issue Cant an https connection be used throughout a users session There is obviously less redirection happeningp  pI found this related question on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions149274httpvshttpsperformancehttp vs. https performanceap  pEdit Ok, I didnt mean used strongonlystrong for login. Rather, what Im trying to ask is if you come to a point where you need https anywhere on your site whether it be login or payments, why not make all communication to the site over httpp  pAs an example, assume a blog site. Now, the blog posts might get created by sending an email. Further down the line, I might provide a login and then an add post action. In this scenario usually the https is used strongonlystrong for the login and then again regular http for actually adding the post. Since, now the need is to provide an admin mode, so to speak, why not have all communication over https while a person is in the admin mode, i.e. logged in.p

Negative 13139 pIs it possible to emulate the behavior of git stash when using fossilbzrp  pBasically Im interested in handling the following workflowp  ul liat some point the source code tree has state X, it is commitedli liI proceed to writing new code, I write it for a while and I see the opportunity of a refactoringli liI cant commit at this point, because the change Ive started to make is not completed, it is not atomic yetli liat this point I would do git stash, would save the current work and would get back to state Xli liI would do the refactoring and commit, source code now has state Yli liI would merge source code in state Y with code in stash, complete the change to make it atomic, then commit once again, pushing the source code to state Zli ul  pI think that generally it is possible to emulate this scenario when using another SCM by branching the code in state X instead of doing git stash, doing the refactoring in that branch, then merging the branch back into the main one. But Im aware that branching is not always a cheap operation. So are there any better particular approaches that eventually rely on specific features of fossilbzrp

Negative 13139 pIve got a TCP server written in C that processes POST data sent to it. Currently it works fine unless a large amount of data i.e. greater than 1GB is sent to it then it runs out of memory I store it all in memory as an array of bytes with a intermediary of a List DTO. For large files now I stream down to disk and then pass the filename around with the intention of streaming it from disk. p  pCurrently all of my routines are written to expect byte arrays which, in hindsight, was a little shortsighted. If I just convert the bytearray to a memorystream will it double the memory usage I think rewriting my code to work on a memorystream will allow me to reuse it when Im reading a stream from diskp  pSorry for the stupid questions, Im never sure when c takes a copy of the data or when it takes a reference.p

Negative 13139 pThis is sort of a metaquestion.  Many snippets of JavaScript Ive seen here on SO are named with a dollar sign prefix for example, codeidcode on the second line of the snippet shown in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2189537javascriptwindowopencodewontworkininternetexplorer7or8thisa question.  Im not referring to jQuery or other libraries.  I am well aware that this is valid, but it seems awkward to do when not necessary.  Why do people name their variables like this  Is it just familiarity with a serverside language like PHP carrying over into their JavaScript codep  pI thought perhaps it was to identify a variable as being a jQuery object, for example when you save the result of a selection to a variable in order to eliminate duplicate selections later on, but I havent seen any consistent convention.p

Among other things this app would also implement a forum. p  pSuppose I want to move a thread from one forum to another. In order to do this, UI layer must pass down to other layers the ID of a thread and the ID of a forum to which I wish to move this thread  UI would pass these parameters by calling method A in BLL layer and A would in turn call method B in DAL layer . p  pa Now should one of the bottom layers provide some sort of checking mechanism to ensure that the two ID arguments supplied by UI layer really represent an existing thread and an existing forum or is it the responsibility of UI layer to provide valid ID values p  pthanxp  pbrp  pEDITp  blockquote   pI would consider the ability to pass invalid IDs a bug.p blockquote  pShould non existing ID be considered a bug just in the case of moving a thread, or also in the case of displaying a thread.

Negative 13139 pIm hoping someone can help me debugging an incredibly frustrating Core Data crash.  I initially load data into two entities representing speakers and titles  I then load a third entity for sessions and try to set relationships to speakers and titles.  from session to speaker and title is onetoone.  from speakertitle back to session is onetomany.  I use a integer key to set up each relationship.p  pSince a given speaker and title can point to multiple sessions, I wrote a function that searches for the appropriate managed object and returns the object.  I then set it for the relationship.p  pThis works fine for the speaker relationship but crashes consistently and horribly for the SECOND title.  Ive rewritten the code a couple of times in different ways and I always end up with the same problem.  And the problem exists regardless of what title comes second.  So Ive gotta be doing something just fundamentally wrong but following along to the Core Data chapters in More iPhone 3 Development nothing jumps out to me.  Im hoping someone might see what Im missing and have been for days.  One last note the crash occurs whether I save the managedObjectContext within the for loop or outside.

Negative 13139 pIm looking to implement branch and bound over a cluster like Amazons say, as I want it to be horizontally scalable, not limited to a single CPU. Theres a paper Task Pool Teams A Hybrid Programming Environment for Irregular Algorithms on SMP Clusters by Judith Hippold and Gudula Runger. Its basically a bottomup, taskstealing framework like Intels TBB, except for adhoc networks instead of shared memory. If this library was available Id use it replacing the local, threaded part with TBB. Unfortunately they dont seem to have made it available for download anywhere that I could find, so I wonder are there other implementations, or similar libraries out there p  pIt doesnt look like Microsofts Task Parallel Library has the equivalent, either, to steal from. p  pI tried to make a tag taskpool after threadpool, the mostused variant before threadpool but, didnt have enough points. Anyone heavy enough think its worth adding p  peditp  pI havent tried it yet, but it PEBBL under here software.sandia.govtracacrowikiPackages claims to scale really high. The paper that the answerer mentions from the Wiley book Parallel BranchandBound Algorithms, Crainic, Le Cun and Roucairol, 2006, from Parallel Combinatorial Optimization, 2006 edited by ElGhazali Talbi was where I found it, and there are other libraries listed some may be better, I reserve the right to update this .

Negative 13139 pI have purchased an Samsung Galaxy I9000 Phone, knowing that it does not have either a trackball nor a touchpadcursorkeys.

Without this permission, you can only deliver events to windows in your own process.. p  pThis clearly states that this permission is available at application level, not only at systemfirmware level.p  pAfter several hours of experimentation I did not find any way to get my program to inject cursor events to any other program than my own.

Negative 13139 pIve got a Silverlight app that has to accept some initial data when it fires up. That data, unfortunately, MUST come from XML input.p  pIn addition, I cant just pass it through the URL because the actual request is coming from a server external to my own.p  pSo the basic setup is this Remote server needs to launch my app. Remote server pops open a window on the users PC with a URL directed at a CGI application that can accept the XML input. The CGI app parses the input and spits out an HTML page containing the Silverlight app with all of the init params set.p  pLong story short When the Silverlight app is opened this way I cant debug it. I attach to the process, but none of the break points can be hit. p  pAny ideasp  pemstrongNoteemstrong I tried every way in the world to get the ASP.NET page that would normally host the Silverlight app to accept the XML in the URL but it would get stripped by ASP.NET because of security reasons and no amount of modifying the config file would fix it since it was stemming from the other web server presumably.p

Negative 13139 pmy knowledge of flash and other web technologies isnt that good, but I was wondering, how do sites with their own API for applications e.g. Facebook authenticate calls from an application Im not really familiar with Facebook API, but Vkontakte similar site uses a secret key, session id and method parameters to generate a query. Why isnt it possible for someone with malicious intent to work out those parameters while the application is in runtime and send a totally different query by, say, changing packets I was kinda planning on writing an application for Vkontakte but I dont understand how the applications are protected. I would also be very grateful if someone could recommend me any literature concerning these questions.p

Negative 13139 pOK Im pulling my hair on on this, it makes no sense so it must either be a bug, or some extremely stupid mistake Im making.p  pHeres the situation I have a UIViewController with a xib file. It has a UIView hooked up to the view property, a UIImageView hooked up to a property called imageView, and a UISegmentedControl hooked up to segmentControl.p  pYet in my code, Im unable to assign an image to the image view. When I NSLog the object, Im getting the address of 0x0, so its not associating at all. I have the bindings set up in Interface builder, Ive restarted XCode and clean and built the project. Nothing is working and Ive wasted a stupid amount of time trying to figure this out at this point. Ive also NSLoged the segmentControl object and am getting 0x0 as well. So nothing from the XIB is hooking up with the code, but the XIB itself is loading because the objects are displayed on the screen.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas offhand of what I could be missing This is such a simple thing, its incredibly frustrating that its refusing to work all of a sudden.p  hr  pHeres the code below, in this case Im accessing the objects in the setter for projectId, but I also tried accessing the imageView from another class and it didnt work either and yes I had a property declaration and synthesize for imageView when I tried.p  pDiagramViewController.hp  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt   interface DiagramViewController  UIViewController       NSUInteger projectId     IBOutlet UIImageView imageView     IBOutlet UISegmentedControl segmentControl   property NSUInteger projectId  end codepre  pDiagramViewController.mp  precodeimport DiagramViewController.h  implementation DiagramViewController synthesize projectId  voidsetProjectIdNSUIntegerprojId      NSLogimageView , imageView     NSLogsegmentControl , segmentControl      projectId  projId      NSString filePath  [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource[NSString stringWithFormatischem, projectId] ofTypepng inDirectoryprojectdetailsimagesdiagrams]     NSData imageData  [NSData dataWithContentsOfFilefilePath]      imageView.image  [UIImage imageWithDataimageData]    BOOLshouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationinterfaceOrientation       Overriden to allow any orientation.     return YES    voiddidReceiveMemoryWarning       Releases the view if it doesnt have a superview.

At the same time, I dont want to completely reinvent the wheel.p  pIt occurred to me that I could perhaps use the WIX declarative schema, but create my own WIX interpreter that will perform the install  uninstall steps as described by a target WIX xml document without using the windows installer.p  pIt would be nice to go a step further, so that I achieve a crossplatform Linux, MAC installerinterpreter.  Of course WIX did not have Linux and MAC in mind.  In which case I either add xml namespaces to extend WIX, or use some other industry format that I am yet unaware of.p  pBut perhaps Im stretching too far.  At the very least it would be nice to have a WIX interpreter or a WIX install executable that strongdoes not create any records in the windows installerstrong.  It need not fulfill every capability of the windows installer.  Id just like to see some basic capabilities fulfilled.p  pDoes anyone know of such a thing, so I can save myself the effort of making it myselfp
Negative 13139 pIve been asked to implement the French translation of an ASP.NET 3.5 website. Each translation is going into its own separate website www.mysite.com, www.mysite.mx, www.mysite.ca, etc. Unfortunately the previous programmer did not implement localization, so each site will have its separate set of files  this is not negotiable.p  pThis French version will also go into its own website www.mysite.ca, but for the moment I have been asked to put it into a subdirectory of the current site, called CA www.mysite.comca. I do not want to start messing around with file paths for navigation and images, because the plan is to move the files in this subdirectory into a separate location in a few weeks. So the only alternative seems to be to move a copy of the site into the subdirectory and set it up as a separate application.p  pWhat is the best way to set this up Since the files in both sites belong to the same namespace and have the same names, how to avoid naming conflicts p

Negative 13139 pIm dealing with an image processing problem that Ive simplified as follows. I have three 10x10 matrices, each with the values 1 or 1 in each cell. Each matrix has an irregular object located emsomewhereem, and there is some noise in the matrix. Id like to figure out how to find the optimal alignment of the matrices that would let me line up the objects so I can get their average. p  pWith the 11 coding, I know that the product of two matrices using elementwise multiplication, not matrix multiplication will yield 1 if there is a match between two multiplied cells and 1 if there is a mismatch, thus the sum of the products yields a measure of overlap. With this, I know I can try out all possible alignments of two matrices to find that which yields the optimal overlap, but Im not sure how to do this with 3  matrices or more  I really have 20 in my actual data set.p  pTo help clarify the problem, here is some code, written in R, that sets up the sort of matricies Im dealing withp  precodeset up the 3 matricies m1  c1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 m1  matrixm1,10  m2  c1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 m2  matrixm2,10  m3  c1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 m3  matrixm3,10  show the matricies imagem1 imagem2 imagem3 notice theres a  shaped object in each  create noise set.seed1 n1  samplec1,1,100,replaceT,probc.95,.05 n1  matrixn1,10 n2  samplec1,1,100,replaceT,probc.95,.05 n2  matrixn2,10 n3  samplec1,1,100,replaceT,probc.95,.05 n3  matrixn3,10  add noise to the matricies mn1  m1n1 mn2  m2n2 mn3  m3n3  show the noisy matricies imagemn1 imagemn2 imagemn3 codepre

Negative 13139 pI create my layout in the onCreateView of the Fragment say FragA the first time it is called and store it in a member variable say ViewA. Now I push another fragment say FragB on top of it and after some work press the back button. This causes the FragAa onCreateView to be called again. Now if I return my saved member Variable ViewA then an exception is thrown saying The specified child already has a parent. You must call removeView on the childs parent first. My question is that, is there no other way to reuse this layout without inflating a new instancep

To verify that the problem is not with my app, I deployed the app in a local Tomcat outside of eclipse in my laptop. It runs perfect.p  pSo I reported again to tech support that emTomcat servlet is not loadingem. I insisted to tech support that the problem is on their end. That there might be something wrong with their apache configuration. Apache is not talking correctly to Tomcat.p  pThey finally did fix it and this is the confirmation I received from them  We have changed some settings in the server configuration file so that all the requests to your domain will be handled by tomcat instead of Apache.p  pI hope this helps someone who is in a shared hosting plan and encounters the same error. If you feel that your Tomcat server is properly set but still keep getting URL not found errors, insist on your tech support to look at their server configuration. Or get a dedicated server if you can afford it so you have total control on your apache server and tomcat.p

Negative 13139 pIm building a multithreaded service application in Delphi XE2. Each thread serves its own purpose apart from the other ones. The main service thread is only responsible for keeping the other threads going and saving a log file, etc. Each of these threads reports back to the main service thread through synchronized event triggers. These threads are created when the service starts and destroyed when the service ends.p  pId like to introduce a separate thread as a centralized database connection to avoid having to create many instances of codeTADOConnectioncode. My service code can call standard functions such as codeUserListDataSet  DBThread.GetUserListSomeUserListDataSetcode or it would also be nice if I could send direct SQL statements like codeSomeDataSet  DBThread.GetMySqlTextcode. Id also like to avoid too many occasions of codeCoInitializecode etc.p  pThe job threads will need to use this db thread. I need to figure out how to ask it for certain data, wait for a response, and acquire that response back in the thread which requested it. Im sure there are many approaches to this, but I need to know which one is best suited for my scenario. Windows messages Events Should I have some sort of queue Should it send data sets or something else Is there already something that can do this I need to figure out how to structure this DB thread in a way that it can be reused from other threads.p  pThe structure looks like thisp  precode SvcThread    DBThread      TADOConnection    Thread1    Thread2    Thread3 codepre  pI need threads 1 2 and 3 to send requests to the DBThread. When a thread sends any request to it, it needs to wait until it gets a response. Once theres a response, the DB Thread needs to notify the asking thread. Each of the threads might send a request to this DB Thread at the same time too.p  pA good tutorial on how to accomplish this would be perfect  it just needs to be a suitable fit for my scenario. I dont need to know just how to make two threads talk together but rather how to make many threads talk to a centralized database thread. These job threads are created as children of the main service thread, and are not owned by the db thread. The db thread has no knowledge of the job threads.p

At this point, I kill it from adb and restart.p  pFor a fresh emulator that i just created with 8GB SD, 1024MB RAM and a heap of 24  this happens after around 250 app installations, all of which had subsequently been removed.p  pAfter restarting, a run would only last 50 or so installations until eventually the emulator doesnt boot at all just stays on the load screenp  pProcrank tells me that theres no excessive memory usage this is for a broken emu that wont startp  precode  PID      Vss      Rss      Pss      Uss  cmdline 30443    3628K    3628K    3193K    3024K  systembinmediaserver    32     700K     700K     350K     208K  systembinrild    29     544K     544K     227K     172K  systembinvold    30     508K     508K     196K     140K  systembinnetd     1     208K     208K     193K     192K  init    40     200K     200K     185K     184K  sbinadbd 30449     328K     328K     132K     116K  procrank    36     408K     408K     129K      84K  systembinkeystore    38     336K     336K     122K     104K  systembinqemud    31     300K     300K     104K      88K  systembindebuggerd 30448     328K     328K     100K      60K  systembinsh    37     328K     328K     100K      60K  systembinsh    51     316K     316K      99K      76K  systembinqemuprops    27     316K     316K      94K      60K  systembinsh    35     272K     272K      90K      76K  systembininstalld    28     284K     284K      88K      72K  systembinservicemanager codepre  pand restarting the adb server doesnt have any effect.

Negative 13139 pI have an ntier application which I have added SignalR functionality to. When I now compile my business layer I have to do a iisreset before the website can load again. It simply just keeps loading, and doesnt get anywhere. Even a kill on the w3wp process doesnt help this out.p  pI have tried and removed SignalR and then it works fine when compiling the backend. My guess is that a connection is made from SignalR to the server, and it is broken when the backend is compiled, which haults the site from doing a complete load.p  pAnything I might be able to do about thisp

Negative 13139 pI have a list of user identifiers which are pretty long. The identifiers may not be exactly identical each time they come with HTTP request therefore I use fuzzy string comparison to authenticate the user. For that very reason, I couldnt hash the identifier because my fuzzy string comparison algorithm wont work with the hashed values since even slightly different plain texts yield completely different values when hashed. Now is there some algorithm algx such that distances1,s1 is in some way proportional to distance algxs1,algxs1 Or is there any other way to go about the problem Note distance in this sense means the amount of editing needed to transform one text into another one.p

Negative 13139 pIve been working for a while now trying to understand SVN better. I am working with a Mac OSX Lion server.

Negative 13139 pI am writing up a silly little script to help me assign ratings to movies in my collection. I have an array of movie titles that need sorting. I want to apply a mergesortlike recursive algorithm to sort the movies by rating. At each comparison, I want a form on the document to be updated. The user will select either A or B  the better of the two titles  and then click a continue button. It will use this information to proceed with the sort. By the end of the process, the user will have answered A or B to the minimum number of binary comparison questions required to produce an ordered list of the movies.p  pMy problem how can I have the recursive algorithm wait on the input from the form for each step Using something like codeconfirmcode would allow the code to block while input is determined, but obviously page elements cant do this. Should I involve some nasty timeout function Keep some kind of global closure Ideally, I want the continue button to be linked to a continueRecursion callback, but I have no idea how to do this.p  pAny suggestions on how to attack thisp

Negative 13139 pIve came upon a problem regarding 2D textures placed on 2D quads. I have a space arcade game and it has asteroids,planets and a ship with textures that load perfectly fine.p  pIm now working on power ups but for some weird reason it only shows one of the 3 different textures I designated on each power up and shows up a big version of the texture at the upper left cornor from time to time which doesn t do anything no collision function.p  pIm loading the texture into the variables before entering the game loop and checked if it is actually loaded and the int values held values so that is fine.

Negative 13139 pIm using jQuery UI tabs and the validation plugin together. Im validating on the click event of a span acting as a pseudo button. Ive only added the validation classes to the form elements visible on the first tab. Also there is one form for the whole page. When I click the button while viewing the first tab, the validation works, however if Im viewing a different tab, clicking the button causes the code to be executed even though the inputs on the first page arent valid.

Negative 13139 pWe have a third party application deployed on JBoss and Weblogic. We need to log access to EJBs in this application for audit purposes. Is it possible to apply a transparent service that will log all calls to these EJBs to a file or database p  pThe only option that I can think of is to use Spring as a business delegate and modify clients to use the Spring bean. Unfortunately, we do not have an option of modifying client code and this has to be done on the server in a way that our code gets executed before and after EJBs are invoked by clients.p  pI searched for a solution for this and have found nothing that could point me the right direction.p  pThank you for the help.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pAfter further research, it appears that JBoss does support custom EJB interceptors.

Negative 13139 pI develop ASP.NET MVC 3 application. Ive downloaded UrlRewriting module and created some rules for my website locally. Next i published this website on the Internet to check performance. Thats ok. Then i continued my work locally again. I commented code block in the web.config file regarding these rules. So there are no rules in IIS Manager too. The problem is that rules still affect For example, i defined Canonical hostname rule to redirect browser to www. site name. So this rule still affect, i.e. local IIS server redirect my locally running website to the real one on the Internet. Also i installed IIS Express to try it out too. Result is the same. I cant figure it out where the problem is. So, there are no rewrite rules on IIS server and IIS Express, but they still affect.p
Negative 13139 pI currently have a search that allows me to filter products down, for a number of combinations.p  pFor instance, I might start with all products, then select by category, or popular stores  it simply crunches the data each time a filter is selected, showing totals for each type of filter and the possible selections still available. The user could do this several times to get to their final list.p  pIm working with EF for the first time and the search will have approx 10k products in to start with.p  pThe main difference in using EF as opposed to Linq2Sql or SP is that it not only gets the data but materializes them at the same time, Whilst a grab of page data takes 60ms the 10k products takes 4s. Whilst this doesnt sound a lot, I cant do it each time a user refreshes a search.p  pI could cache the data, but this does limit the application somewhat in terms of an upper threshold or server farms, although it will fit the bill now.p  pI was wondering however if there are any better way of achiveing this other than creating a bespoke SP. I dont want to use javascript because it is fundamental to the working of the site.p  pAnyone have any ideas p

SWList has a field AppName eg iTunes and AppID eg 1001.

Negative 13139 pI am generating course notes which have teacher solutions in them.

It creates a directory, copies a .docx file to .zip in the temp directory, unzips it, then does this search and replace.  but its wiping out a lot of the document, not just the teacher notes.  The first suspect is the regular expression.

And in fact using the given materials the algorithm wont find a solution.p  pThe point is that the program will check ALL possible combinations, returning only those recipes which completely satisfy the chemical analysis.p  pBut this approach has two problemsp  ol lipRecursion is very inefficient.  Possibly includes duplicate recipes which I eliminate by storing in a tree structure.  The more variables there are the longer the program takes to long, at a certain point taking a very very long time.pli lipThe algorithm doesnt account well for combinations of materials fulfilling an oxide.  For instance, it will find a recipe using a maximum of Potassium Feldspar to fulfill SiO2 or a maximum of Soda Feldspar to fulfill SiO2, but it wont necessarily find a recipe combining the two materials. Currently I have a hack that incrementally reduces the amount of a given material by a certain percentage and then recursively checks again using that reduced amount.  In the example above, the algorithm will reduce Kaolin by 5 each iteration until Kaolin is zero.  This is horribly inefficientpli ol  pAnyone have any ideasp  pThanks  Derekp

I can actually see that the size of file on server does not gradually increase as I would expect, instead, in the moment it is created it is already 100MB big.p  pstrongThe questionstrong How can I get this to work so that the input stream buffer is reasonably small say, 1MB and when it overflows, my codeUploadcode method gets called In other words, I want the upload to be truly streamed without having to buffer the whole file anywhere.p  pstrongEDITstrong I now discovered the codehttpRuntimecode contains another setting that is relevant here  coderequestLengthDiskThresholdcode. It seems that when the input buffer grows beyond this threshold, it is no longer stored in memory, but instead, on filesystem. So at least the whole 100MB big file is not kept in memory this is what I was most afraid of, however, I still would like to know whether there is some way to strongavoid this buffer altogetherstrong.p

Negative 13139 h2Introh2  pIm currently working on a project which involves the daily extraction of data pharmacy records from a VisualFox Pro database, and uploading some of it to a WordPress site, where clients of the pharmacy can securely view it. I would like some advice in terms of the general methodology of my software  I am able to code it, but need to know if Im going the right way about it. Im writing both the PC software in C.NET 4.5 and the PHP WordPress plugin.p  h2Question 1 Encryptionh2  pThe current process for encrypting the data serverside I plan to use is based on a hrefhttpi.amniels.commysqldatabaseencryptionusingpublicprivatekeys relnofollowthis articlea. Summarised, it advocates encrypting each separate users data asymmetrically with their own public key, stored on the server. The private key to decrypt this data is then itself encrypted symmetrically using the users password, and stored. This way, even if the database is stolen, the users password hash needs to be broken, and even then the process needs to be repeated for every users data.p  pThe only weakness, pointed out by the author himself, and the main point of my question, is the fact that while the user is logged in, the decrypted key is stored in session storage. The way the article suggests to deal with it is to just limit the time the user is logged in. I thought a better solution would be to store that key in a shortlived secure cookie of course the whole process is happening over HTTPS. That way, if the attacker has control of the users computer and can read their cookies, they can probably just keylog their password and log in, no need to steal the database, while even if the attacker gains access to the server, they cannot decrypt the HTTPS traffic or can they Im not sure.p  pstrongShould I use secure cookies or session storage to temporarily store the decrypted keystrongp  h2Question 2 Storageh2  pThe second thing I still want to work out is how to store the data  this is more of an efficiency problem. Since every user has their own key for encryption, it follows that records for every user must be stored separately. I dont know if I should store a block of data for every user, containing encrypted JSON with an array of objects representing records, or whether I should store records in a table with the actual data structure, and encrypt each data field separately with the key.p  pI am leaning towards storing the data as one block  it seems to me to be more efficient to decrypt one big block of data at a time, than perhaps several thousands separate fields. Also, even if I stored the data in its proper structure, I still wouldnt be able to use MySQLs WHERE, ORDERBY etc, since the data would all be BLOBs.p  pstrongShould I store the data as a big block per user, or separated into the different fieldsstrongp  h2Question 3 Transferh2  pI extract the data from the DBF file, and essentially make a diff, whereby I compare the current extracted data from the last days data, and only upload the blocks of the users that have changed I cant only upload the records, as I probably will end up storing the users data in blocks. I also include delete instructions for users which have been deleted. This is as there are hundreds of thousands records in the database, totalling over 200mb, and the size increases every day.p  pMy current plan is to write all this data to a JSON file, gzip it and upload it to the server. My question is, how do I do that while ensuring the security of the data Naturally, the upload will happen over HTTPS, and I have an API password in place to only allow authorised uploads, but my main concern is how to protect the data if the server is compromised. I dont want the attacker to just grab the JSON file from the server while its being processed. One idea I had was to get the server to send me a list of public keys for the users, and perform the encryption in my software, before the upload. It seems to me like thats the only way of protecting that data. I could encrypt the whole JSON file, perhaps with an API key or a special password, but thats moot if the attacker can just access the decrypted file as its being processed on the server. Is that a good solutionp  pstrongShould I encrypt the data individually clientside, or is there a way to securely transfer it to the server and encrypt it therestrongp  pThanks in advance for any answers, Id love to hear from someone whos dealt with problems like this before.p  pNote a hrefhttpprogrammers.stackexchange.comquestions187947ineedadvicedevelopingasensitivedatatransferstorageencryptionsystemcrossposted to emProgrammersema, see comments.p

Negative 13139 pI am writing multiplatform code which needs to use a pointer to setjmpsigsetjmp. Normally that would be as simple as doingp  precodeinclude ltsetjmp.hgt void  sigsetjmpp  sigsetjmp codepre  pHowever, ISO and POSIX state that setjmpsigsetjmp can be defined as a macro, and indeed that is the case in my linux box. Heres an excerpt from codeusrincludesetjmp.hcodep  precode define sigsetjmpenv, savemask       sigsetjmp env, savemask codepre  pThe problem is that, since I am not passing arguments to codesigsetjmpcode, the macro doesnt expand and the plain codesigsetjmpcode symbol is not defined in libc. I was hoping to be able to use some macro black magic to extract the sigsetjmp name, but I have failed miserably so far.p  pAnother option would be using  codesigsetjmpcode directly but this would imply checking the expansion for every supported platform, which I dont want to do hence the reason of this question.p  pPS I hate macros.p  pstrongNotestrongp  pThe reason for which I need this is a bit obscure, but to simplify it, lets say I want to perform pointer comparisons with it.p  precodeinclude ltsetjmp.hgt int equalssigsetjmpvoid p   void  sigsetjmpp   sigsetjmp  return p  sigsetjmpp  codepre  pstrongEditstrongp  pYes, yes. I know I shouldnt count on getting a pointer to codesigsetjmpcode because it might not even be a function in certain platforms but strongthis doesnt solve my problemstrong.p  pIn practice, all platforms I know of implement it as a function. p  pI can cope with the fact that, in a few years, I run into a case in which codesigsetjumpcode is not a function for certain platform.

Negative 13139 pI am trying to write a short macro that will copy and paste data from an excel file to PowerPoint.

Negative 13139 pI am developing a 508 html table parsing the excel files. I want to read the cells data which is being displayed not the float values as roo spits out. When there are formulas roo gem is not just reading the data after the format is applied. Like here I get float values ex 90.909090909090907 but the number being displayed on the excel is 91. Its fine if I just get string values of the excel data being displayed.p  pThank you in advance.p

If i want to design my own find program which should first scan all the directories and store the info either in some file or DB. Now whenever I want to search for a file, we first need to load the info from the DB or file and then search.p  pI need suggestions to decide which datastructure to use for storing the directory structure which can then be loaded and queried for a given file name. p  pSince search is based on file name, I thought of using Hashmap, where key will be filename and value will the fullpath. Using Trie will make the search slower. Another idea is to use Inverted index. But not sure which once is better.p  pThanks. p

Negative 13139 pI have made a codeHomeViewModelcode which contains some other codeViewModelcodes to be presented in a codeTabParPresentercode.

The navigation event gets caught by the codeTabBarPresenterHostcode, which is simply the codePresentercode of the application and if a codeTabBarPresentercode is present and not null it is passed to the codeTabBarPresenter.ShowViewcode method. All this happens before the codeTabBarPresentercode is done loading and codeSelectedViewControllercode is set in codeViewDidLoadcode.

Negative 13139 pIn QTP, checkpoints can be used to define an expected state, which the checkpoint then checks. p  pThat results in a checkpoint entry in the object repository OR, which contains the identification properties of the test object to checkto query for the data, and a timeout value.p  pFor example, a bitmap checkpoint contains such a timeout value.p  pIf you set it to 5 using the bitmap checkpoint properties dialog, QTP attempts to wait for the actual image to match the expected image within 5 seconds.p  pIf you set it to 0, QTP does not wait at all.p  pemThis is all documented welldefined behavior. OK.emp  pNow  what if my app became slower, and all my checkpoint timeouts have become too low so all of them now failp  pemI will have to increase the timeout values manually in all checkpoints.  Or, since I am smart, I could export the object repositories to XML, and do a smart mass searchandreplace operation in those XML files with some clever tool.emp  pThis is ok if it is a onetime action. But what if this happens more than once in a year or so What if you have not just one central OR, but lots and lot of actionrepositories The export alone would already be tedious.p  pNow and this is the true situation that leads to this question to have a unified  timeout handling, I have one constant defined for a short and one for a long time interval in seconds. emAllem our tests code uses one of these two constants if it needs to wait for something, poll for a state or do anything else that is timeoutrelated.  We even set the default object recognition delay in QTPs web config programmatically to the short interval constants value at library init to make sure that nobody uses a different value for standard timeouts during playback. This really helps to keep test results comparable.p  pThis way, I can define maximum wait times both of them, the one for quick operations like navigation and the one for long big jobs centrally in my library code, simply by editing those two constants values. emCool.emp  pemExcept for checkpoints.em strongHow can I force all checkpoints to use, say, the short interval constants value I cant.strong So lets consider workarounds which certain people would call solutions  p  ul lipFirst idea emparameterize the timeout.em Scratch that, QTP does not support that.pli lipSecond idea emSee above  export all ORs, masssearchandreplace, reimport. Scratch that, to replicate a central change  this way  is not exactly central configuration. And it is very errorprone if you have lots of peractionORs.empli lipThird idea emCreate a tool that uses QTPs object model or automation object model API to update the checkpoint values at test runtime.em Mmmh. Extra code for .Check call. Mmmh.pli lipFourth idea Considering that during checkpoint execution, every Checkpoint  reference fetched from the OR is passed  to the particular test objects Check method, one could emcreate a global function that accepts a checkpoint, patches its timeout value, and calls the original Check method with the patched checkpoint. Then, the original Check method would use the timeout value it finds in the checkpoint.em Great. But I would really have to register this custom Check method with every test object class I use. Or, to make it right, even in emallem test object classes QTP knows. Also, it seems to be far from trivial to accessupdate a checkpoints timeout value during test runtime. But at least all those code.Check .Checkpointcode checkpoint calls could stay the way they are. Mmmmmh again. pli ul  pstrongAny better ideas Has anybody tried this, or found an elegant solution to parameterizing timeout values in checkpointsstrongp

Negative 13139 pIm currently using the SessionStart function within the Global.ascx file to save when an authenticated user visits my site. p  pThis works OK if a users session expires, however as Im using persistent cookies the user may return to the site within 28 days and this function will not be called and therefore will not be recording in the database that the user has visited.p  pIve taken a good look at all the functions available within Global.ascx, however I cannot find one that will perform what I need.p  pApplicationStart  triggered only run within life cycle ApplicationBeginRequest  each and every request made ApplicationAuthenticateRequest   each and every request SessionStart   when a new session is startedp  pThe two events that I believe could be used are ApplicationBeginRequest or ApplicationAuthenticateRequest. p  pIs there any way of limiting the above events to only run specific code on the first visit to a site and not on each request p  pAlternatively is there any way of using my master filep  pAny suggestions would be very useful.p  pCheers p

All in vain..br I know the textview exists because when i click the first rowwhich is overlapping the textview the click event gets fired..br All i want is that no matter what my textview should be visible and the linear layout must take its position below the textview if it is visible..br strongEDITstrong  p  precodeRelativeLayout wrapperlayout  new RelativeLayoutgetActivity wrapperlayout.setLayoutParamsnew android.widget.RelativeLayout.LayoutParamsandroid.widget.RelativeLayout.LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT, android.widget.RelativeLayout.LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT  HANDLE TextView txtHeader  new TextViewgetActivity txtHeader.setOnClickListenernew OnClickListener       SuppressLintNewApi     Override     public void onClickView v           TODO Autogenerated method stub         TextView tv  TextView v         RelativeLayout rParent   RelativeLayout tv.getParent         LinearLayout lInner  LinearLayout rParent.getChildAt1          iflInner.isShown                      tv.setCompoundDrawablesWithIntrinsicBoundsR.drawable.expand, 0, 0, 0             tv.bringToFront             lInner.setVisibilityView.GONE             lInner.startAnimationAnimationUtils.loadAnimationgetActivity, R.anim.slideup                  else             tv.setCompoundDrawablesWithIntrinsicBoundsR.drawable.collapse, 0, 0, 0             tv.bringToFront             lInner.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE             lInner.setToptv.getBottom             lInner.startAnimationAnimationUtils.loadAnimationgetActivity, R.anim.slidedown                  txtHeader.setTextHeader txtHeader.setCompoundDrawablesWithIntrinsicBoundsR.drawable.expand, 0, 0, 0 txtHeader.setLayoutParamsnew android.widget.LinearLayout.LayoutParamsandroid.widget.LinearLayout.LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT, android.widget.LinearLayout.LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT   CONTENT LinearLayout lContent  new LinearLayoutgetActivity lContent.setLayoutParamsnew android.widget.LinearLayout.LayoutParamsandroid.widget.LinearLayout.LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT, android.widget.LinearLayout.LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT lContent.setOrientationLinearLayout.VERTICAL  HashMapltString, Stringgt MySet  new HashMapltString, Stringgt MySet  getData IteratorltStringgtRowItr  MySet.keySet.iterator int rowcnt  0 while RowItr.hasNext      LinearLayout lRow  new LinearLayoutgetActivity     LinearLayout.LayoutParams lparams1  new LinearLayout.LayoutParamsLayoutParams.MATCHPARENT, LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT     lRow.setLayoutParamslparams1     lRow.setOrientationLinearLayout.HORIZONTAL      TextView txtLbl  new TextViewgetActivity     txtLbl.setLayoutParamsnew LinearLayout.LayoutParams0, android.view.ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT, 1     TextView txtVal  new TextViewgetActivity     txtVal.setLayoutParamsnew LinearLayout.LayoutParams0, android.view.ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT, 1      String Lbl  RowItr.next     txtLbl.setTextLbl     ifrowcnt  2  0         lRow.setBackgroundColorColor.parseColordbe4f0     else         lRow.setBackgroundColorColor.parseColorffffff     txtVal.setTextMySet.getLbl     lRow.addViewtxtLbl     lRow.addViewtxtVal     lRow.setPadding10, 10, 10, 10      lContent.addViewlRow     rowcnt                         lContent.setVisibilityView.GONE  wrapperlayout.addViewtxtHeader wrapperlayout.addViewlContent RelativeLayout.LayoutParams rPARAMS  new RelativeLayout.LayoutParamsandroid.widget.RelativeLayout.LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT, android.widget.RelativeLayout.LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT rPARAMS.addRuleRelativeLayout.ABOVE, txtHeader.getId rPARAMS.addRuleRelativeLayout.BELOW, lContent.getId wrapperlayout.setLayoutParamsrPARAMS codepre

Not worried about the calc just yet, just trying to get the GUI up and running first.

Negative 13139 pVery shortly I will be required to do an integration between Quickbooks Desktop and a PHP website. Im aware that there exists a PHP QuickBooks class that helps with integrating, but to my knowledge that only works when the PHP site is the one to initiate contact with the Desktop application. Its required of me that when a Purchase Order andor Product is created on QuickBooks, it will automatically and instantaneously send the information over to my website using a REST API. Considering there will be multiple instances of QuickBooks Desktop that will be connected we will allow customers to use a QuickBooks application that we will build, it is not practical to have to constantly check if ALL of those QuickBooks Desktop instances have any new Purchase Orders or Products that have been created since the last time we checked.p  pIs there a way to somehow add code to QuickBooks to send Purchase Orders and Products upon creation to my website using a REST APIp  pThank youp

If I raise a signal directly after connecting a slot, everything works fine, but if the class raises the signals lateron, I receive segmentation faults.p  pI think this may have something to do with threading in the c lib It is also using boosasio etc.p  pHere are some code snippetsp  pMyClass.hp  precodepublic     typedef boostsignals2signalltvoid stdsharedptrltintgtgt signalmysig     void connectslotboostpythonobject const amp slot  private     signalmysig    msig codepre  pMyClass.cppp  precodevoid MyClassconnectslotboostpythonobject const amp slot       stdcout ltlt register shd ltlt stdendl     msig.connectslot      msig12345  this works    void MyClasssomelaterevent      msig654321  this does not work   codepre  pI call the MyClassconnectslot function in python with a custom python function like thisp  precodedef testfuncsomeint     printslot called  m  myext.MyClass m.connectslottestfunc codepre  pThe backtrace using gdb of the segmentation fault that is raised in codeMyClasssomelatereventcode looks like thisp  precode[Thread debugging using libthreaddb enabled] Using host libthreaddb library libx8664linuxgnulibthreaddb.so.1.

Negative 13139 pI have an N by N grid, with values in each box. I have to move from the topleft corner to the bottomright corner path 1 and from the topright corner to the bottomleft path 2. When I move from topleft to bottomright I can only move down or to the right. Likewise, when I move from the topright to the bottomleft I can only move left and down. p  pBut if I move down while taking path 1, the corresponding move for path 2 should be to the left. Similarly, if I move right while taking path 1, the corresponding move for path 2 should be down. p  pAs we take both paths, we sum up the values we encounter in each box. What is the maximum value we can obtainp  pConsider as an example the following gridp  precode 6   0   3  1   7   4   2   4  3   3  2   8  13  10  1  4  codepre  pThe best paths we can take are represented as follows path one is represented by a , while path 2 by a . p  precode6  0   3  1  7  4 2  4  3  3 2 8  13 10 1  4 codepre  pThe sum for both of these paths is 56. p  pWe have to devise an algorithm to compute the maximum possible score given an arbitrary N by N grid. p  pIt was pretty clear that this was a DP problem. So, I tried to identify a recurrence relation, so to speak. I tried using the recurrence relation from the classic problem of finding the maximum sum over all paths in an N by M  grid, but that didnt work because it just got too complicated. p  pI tried to divide the N by N grid into four N1 by N1 grids that overlap, so demonstrating this in a 3 by 3 gridp  precodea1 a2 a3  a4 a5 a6  a7 a8 a9 codepre  pI divided this into four 2 x 2 gridsp  precodea1 a2  ,   a2 a3   ,   a4 a5   ,  a5 a6  a4 a5  ,   a5 a6   ,   a7 a8   ,  a8 a9 codepre  pAssuming we know the best paths for all these grids, can we then compute the best path for the larger grid p  pWell, this seemed promising, but I quickly found out that these recurrence relations, were dependent on the larger case. For example, p  pIf we consider the second 2 x 2 grid, assuming we know the best path 1 and path 2  S. Now, clearly, for us to get from a1 to a2, we need to move right, but this means that the first move in the sub case the first move in path 2 should be to the down, which isnt guaranteed. p  pHow do we solve thisp

Negative 13139 pIn apps like Snapchat, Line, Kik, Groupme, etc., users have their contact list from which they can send messages to multiple people.p  pIm building a messaging app that has similar features and at first was going to just add a server and let the server store device tokens and send notifications from the server. By the way I am using Urban Airship to send push notifications. So the way I had imagined was like thisp  ol liUser A writes Hi there to User Bli liHi there gets posted to my server where it gets stored in DB for later retrievalli liAfter 2 is successful, the server posts Hi there to Urban Airship server Server has the contact list which has all the device id infoli ol  pThen I realized how this could be done client side as well, that is, if its ok to store device tokens of a users contacts on their apps. So this is how it would workp  ol liUser A writes Hi there to User Bli liHi there gets posted to my server where it will be stored in DB for later retrievalli liAfter 2 is successful, the client iPhone posts Hi there directly to Urban Airship server The app stores all of the users contacts device ids in core datali ol  pIm a newbie at push notification so dont even know if its safeok to store device tokens on the client side, but I feel like it would be much more efficient in terms of server load my server since all the push notifications requests are sent from the client. Any suggestions on what the best practice is Thank youp

Negative 13139 pIm working with Websphere 7 and Websphere MQ 7 I have a message driven bean MDB deployed in Websphere which is bound to a WebSphere MQ Activation Specification configured queue.  The MDB will be receiving messages in EDCIDIC format and need to convert this  into ASCII. In the past, directly connecting to the MQ server using native MQ API we had the option to programmatically  convert the message using i.e.  the following excerptp  precodegmo.options  MQC.MQGMOCONVERT Handles EBCDICASCII getq  qmgr.accessQueueresponseQueue whiletrue      MQMessage msgId  new MQMessage     msgId.characterSet  1208     getq.getmsgId, gmo  codepre  pBut using MDBs JMS  there doesnt seem to be an option to instruct the conversion. I suspect Websphere should have a setting to do the conversion as it acts as a bridge between  MQ server and the MDB but cant seem to find a setting in the console.p  pAny ideas please p

Its easy to force it to look the same either by using the codedataframecode argument to codetoJSONcode or by coercing the codedata.framecode into a codelistcode.p  pUsing OpenCPUs API, the calls look similarp  precode curl httplocalhost7177ocpulibrarybaseRlistjson H ContentType applicationjson d  xx[1,2,3], yy[6,7,8]           xx  [                 1,                 2,                 3         ],         yy  [                 6,                 7,                 8         ]    curl httplocalhost7177ocpulibrarybaseRdata.framejson H ContentType applicationjson d  xx[1,2,3], yy[6,7,8]  [                          xx  1,                 yy  6         ,                          xx  2,                 yy  7         ,                          xx  3,                 yy  8          ] codepre  pIf I want the codedata.framecode itself to be JSONified columnbased then I need to coerce it to a codelistcodep  precode curl httplocalhost7177ocpulibrarybaseRdata.frame H ContentType applicationjson d  xx[1,2,3], yy[6,7,8]  ocputmpx000a0fb8R.val ocputmpx000a0fb8stdout ocputmpx000a0fb8source ocputmpx000a0fb8console ocputmpx000a0fb8info   curl httplocalhost7177ocpulibrarybaseRas.listjson d xx000a0fb8          xx  [                 1,                 2,                 3         ],         yy  [                 6,                 7,                 8         ]  codepre  pThree questionsp  ol lipIs there a way to change the default behavior of the OpenCPU autoJSONification to be columnbasedpli lipIs there a reason besides had to default to something that it defaults to rowbased So that I can better understand the underpinnings and efficiencies, not meant as a challenge.pli lipThis is all academic, though, since most if not all libraries accepting the JSON output will understand and translate between the formats transparently.

Negative 13139 pI was reading this document a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgcommunityerrorhandling.html relnofollowError Handlinga on the boost website. in the point five i found this suggestion.p  blockquote   pBlockquote   Dont worry too much about the what message. Its nice to have a message that a programmer stands a chance of figuring out, but youre very unlikely to be able to compose a relevant and usercomprehensible error message at the point an exception is thrown. Certainly, internationalization is beyond the scope of the exception class author. Peter Dimov makes an excellent argument that the proper use of a what string is to serve as a key into a table of error message formatters. Now if only we could get standardized what strings for exceptions thrown by the standard library...p blockquote  pIm wondering on how this can be realized in a language independent way  but im not so experienced.. can you make some examples p  pThanksp

Negative 13139 pIm currently working on a PHP web app and using MySQL xampp default settings as my dbms.

So User 11 will automatically issue done in my code INSERT query since infoupdate  TRUE no longer exist in the table.p  p1 My question is, if these queries are issue to the dbms at the exact same time, will all the above queries update to the same row infoid brp  p2 If the answer on Q1 is no, Im I right to say that SELECT infoid FROM table WHERE infoupdate  TRUE ORDER BY infoid DESC will generate different infoid in this case instead of infoid 10 for every querybrp  p3 Do I need to use RabbitMQ to queue all these request so that the request gets executed one by one, User 1 request executed then User 2 request executed then User 3 request executed Im new to RabbitMQ anyway, so Im not really sure if RabbitMQ could do this....p

Negative 13139 pI am trying to refactor some code. All along the code base, I have code that stores userrelated informations like this p  precodethis.users[user][field]  data  codepre  pNote that there could be an arbitrary number of subfields including none, like this p  precodethis.users[user][field][subfield1][subfield2]  data  codepre  pTheses informations are retrieved like this p  precodevar result  this.users[user][field]  codepre  pIn production, the actual data will be stored into Redis. To prepare for this, I would like to refactor those access into two functions, say codefunction storeUserDatauser, fields, datacode and codefunction retrieveUserDatauser, fieldcode.p  pI can do it trivially if there is only one field. But how can I write those two functions to allow for an arbitrary number of subfields ideally none as well p  pEdit  the longterm goal is to blur the difference between redis keys and node.js arrays. That way I could for instance access a node subfield like this  codeusers.user.idcode and also have it in redis like this codeusers.user..idcode. Does that seem feasible p

Negative 13139 pIm developing a multimedia publishing app and wanted to hear another opinion on this idea of mine.p  pI have a UICollectionView with cells of various types and sizes  text paragraphs, images, videos, ... Ive modified the layout to arrange these cells into newspaperlike columns but since the cells almost never fit the view, there are often great gaps at the ends of the columns. I was thinking whether it would be possible to add a touch of elasticity to the layout. Many types of cells, like images and videos, can be squeezed or expanded a little without user ever noticing. Other cells, like text paragraphs, can be broken down into smaller pieces. The layout could use these modifications to even the columns in height.p  pDo you think its technically possible to implement Secondly, do you think this is a good approach for multimedia app with custom publishing formatp  pThanks for your opinions, Pete.p

Negative 13139 pI need help. I had a working website. The last step before going live was to update the ssl certificates. That did not happen due to a bug in that version of erlang. I upgraded erlang and then had a mismatch in code levels between erlang and the yaws driver. I donloaded and complied yaws and to my extreme pleasure I was able to update the ssl certificates. After starting the roll out, a user pointed out that the upload feature was not working. I verified that it still worked with the version that would not accept ssl cert. I assumed that the problem was in the build process, so I started over with a fresh VM of CentOS 7 and the erlang and Yaws from that distro. Same problem. It appears that I can have upload or new certs but not both. My version of the upload is a slightly modified version from the std upload.yaws. However,  I picked that up and tried it.

Negative 13139 pI have been using Spring XD for a while for continuous ingestion of sensor data and it works perfectly. p  pThe new requirement that I have is the ability to replay portions of that data. In my particular case it would be reading from MongoDB with a certain query, generate a UDP packet with a certain filed of the entry and send it to a SocketAddress in a fixed interval of time.p  pThe first attempt that I am implementing is through springbatch job. The reader is simple since it is just querying MongoDB for the data, but I am concern about the UDP portion. It does not feel natural to use springbatch for sending UDP packets, so I would like to know if anybody can suggest me an idea for implementing this.p  pThanksp

Negative 13139 pSo Ive been tracking a bug for a day or two now which happens out on a remote server that I have little control over.  The ins and outs of my code are, I provide a jar file to our UI team, which wraps postgres and provides storage for data that users import.  The import process is very slow due to multiple reasons, one of which is that the users are importing unpredictable, large amounts of data which we cant really cut down on.  This has lead to a whole plethora of time out issues.p  pAfter some preliminary investigation, Ive narrowed it down to the jdbc to the postgres database is timing out.  I had a lot of trouble replicating this on my local test setup, but have finally managed to by reducing the socketTimeout of the connection properties to 10s theres more than 10s between each call made on the connection.p  pMy question now is, what is the best way to keep this alive  Ive set the tcpKeepAlive to true, but this doesnt seem to have an effect, do I need to poll the connection manually or something  From what Ive read, Im assuming that polling is automatic, and is controlled by the OS.  If this is true, I dont really have control of the OS settings in the run environment, what would be the best way to handle this p  pI was considering testing the connection each time it is used, and if it has timed out, I will just create a new one.  Would this be the correct course of action or is there a better way to keep the connection alive  Ive just taken a look at this post where people are suggesting that you should open and close a connection per query a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8345133whenmyapplosesconnectionhowshoulditrytorecoverWhen my app loses connection, how should I try to recoverap  pIn my situation, I have a series of sequential inserts which take place on a single thread, if a single one fails, they all fail.

Negative 13139 pIm having trouble aligning the fragments to the center of the view pages, in a way that the user can see multiple fragments on the screen. This problem has already been solved before, but not when the fragments have different size.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9468581canviewpagerhavemultipleviewsinperpageCan ViewPager have multiple views in per pagea is one link that I used. The pagercontainer solution on it works but is very slow. My solution was to set ViewPager padding through codesetPaddingint, int, int, intcode method and codefalsecode for codesetClipToPaddingcode. Doing so makes the fragments look as if theyre aligned in the center, but assumes that all fragments are the same size since codesetPaddingcode is a global setting for a codeViewcode. So having different fragment sizes just completely messes the alignment. p  pI was hoping if someone knew how to make it so that the current fragment in view pager can be aligned to center without the use of padding. That way one could have different fragment sizes. Alternatively, could someone suggest how to achieve center alignment with padding with variable fragment sizesp  pPS Ive searched everywhere online and couldnt find a solution.p

Negative 13139 pI know that we can add some default options settings to POST request in jQuery, but my question is the following  strongCan I add a default field with value to the POST so it will be sent with each post requeststrongp  pFor example  if I have  codenameJohnampage20code and I send them with code.postcode method, I want PHP to receive it as  codenameJohnampage20ampdefaultField1defaultValue1codep  pP.S I know that I can add fields to the form using codeappendcode or methods like this or directly to the array of data before code.serializecode, but it will be much better if I will be able to add it as default option. emField I need will be request token, so PHP wont process datas if this key is not setemp
Negative 13139 pI have developed a Java Bundle, however i am having a problem,p  pI am able to use System.setProperties on the bundle Activator, and the change works just fine. However, if i use it outside of the Activator it just doesnt work.p  pThe property i am changing is javax.net.ssl, the keystore path, the type and the password. Since i am using a plugin from a 3rd party application, whenever i load a method to request a web service, it loads the Activator, sets the properties on the JVM and is able to communicate just fine. However, if i set it inside the class i am calling the method, it doesnt work.p  pI have even set a proxy class, to do the job and call the method, however isnt working either, and i cant figure why.p  pThe problem is that i want to have the path, type and password to be entered from the 3rd party application, and on the activator class i cant do it.p  pCan you guys help mep

Negative 13139 pI am fairly sure I have something simple setup incorrectly in my project, but I sure could use some help finding out whatp  pI have the latest GGTS and Grails 2.4.3.  I tried to make a REST Controller in a project that two of us are working on.  As this was new to me, when it didnt work, I found an article that showed how simple it was and followed it exactly in a new, empty project.  Everything worked properly and as advertised  I used grails commands to create the project, the domain class and then the controller.p  pI went back to my original project and did the same steps except for creating the project which already existed, but WAS created via the grails command.  Instead of working, when I hit the rest URL via a GET it returns a HTTP 404 status and a message saying that it can not find index.gsp.  Of course, index.gsp does not exist.  However, it should return json as requested.  My question is whyp  pSince I am now just trying to get the REST calls working, the Domain class is trivial  three String fields.  No other relationships.  The Controller extends RestfulController.  No static scaffold or anything like that....p  pemWhat is the same in each projectemp  pMost of the setup is original and untouched.  Both the URLMapping files are identical.  Both of the Config.groovy files are identical.  p  pemWhat is different between the two projectsemp  pThe main difference is that three 3 nonREST controllers already exist.  This is far and away the biggest difference that I see.  Is there an issue  need to configure something when mixing Controllers REST and nonRest or should they peacefully coexistp  pThe only other difference is the existing project that does not work has AngularJS and Bootstrap.  Nothing else has been added.p  pAny ideas appreciatedp  pstrongGory detailsstrongp  pThe curl command used to hit the endpointp  precodecurl  H Accept applicationjson httplocalhost8080myprojectexample codepre  presponsep  precodelthtmlgtltheadgtlttitlegtApache Tomcat7.0.55  Error reportlttitlegtltstylegtltH1 [deleted font family lines...] color  blackA.name color  blackHR color  525D76gtltstylegt ltheadgtltbodygtlth1gtHTTP Status 404  ampquotWEBINFgrailsappviewsexampleindex.gspampquot not found.lth1gt ltHR size1 noshadenoshadegtltpgtltbgttypeltbgt Status reportltpgtltpgtltbgtmessageltbgt ltugtampquotWEBINFgrailsappviewsexampleindex.gspampquot not found.ltugtltpgtltpgt  ltbgtdescriptionltbgt ltugtThe requested resource is not available.ltugtltpgt ltHR size1 noshadenoshadegtlth3gtApacheTomcat7.0.55lth3gtltbodygtlthtmlgt codepre  pDomain Classp  precodepackage com.mycompany.rest  import groovy.transform.EqualsAndHashCode import groovy.transform.ToString  ToStringincludeNames  true, includeFields  true, excludes  dateCreated, lastUpdated EqualsAndHashCode class Example       Long id     Long version     Date dateCreated     Date lastUpdated      String name     String description       static constraints           name blankfalse, nullablefalse         description blankfalse, nullable false       codepre  pControllerp  precodepackage com.mycompany.rest  import grails.rest.RestfulController  class ExampleController extends RestfulControllerltExamplegt       static responseFormats  [json, xml]      ExampleController              superExample         codepre

Negative 13139 pI have a flow in my application like thisp  pstrongFor new usersstrongp  pSplash Screen  Login Activity  Home Activityp  pstrongFor already registered usersstrongp  pSplash Screen  Home Activityp  pBasically the strongSplash Screenstrong has an if else to decide which activity to go to. Once a first time user logs in, his status is saved in a preference variable for the splash screen to decide next time not to open the login activity.p  pNow the situation is that. If a new user logs in and goes to the home activity, and then logs out. He is redirected to the Login screen which is pretty much what should happen. But, in case an existing user opens the app, he is shown the Splash screen and directly moved to the Home Activity. Now if the  user logs out, he gets out of the app. This happens because the Login Activity does not have any instance created and thus finishing the Home Activity finishes the whole app. Logout actually finishes the Home Activity, naturally the last active activity should open up. Which is not happening.p  pstrongWhat I want to do is that, I want to implement a logic which will check that the Login Activity is available or not. If its available then codefinishcode will be called else the Login Activity will be called via intent.strongp  pPlease tell me how to achieve this.p  pstrongP.S My app uses a custom theme with a customized action bar. If I call finish and Intent together or I use flags to clear existing activities then there is a weird transition effect which shows the black standard action bar for a split second thus creating a bad user experience.strongp

Negative 13139 pEssentially, Im wondering if the top answer given to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9504073checkthatanydirectoryexistsinsidegivenonethis questiona can be implemented in Python. I am reviewing the modules os, os.path, and shutil and I havent yet been able to find an easy equivalent, though I assume Im just missing something simple.p  pMore specifically, say I have a directory A, and inside directory A is emany other directoryem. I can call codeos.walkpathtoAcode and check if codedirnamescode is empty, but I dont want to make the program go through the entire tree rooted at A i.e. what Im looking for should stop and return true as soon as it finds a subdirectory.p  pFor clarity, on a directory containing files but no directories an acceptable solution will return False.p

Negative 13139 pI intend to build a view controller that can display one two different views, using a custom transition to move between each. I am not sure what which kind of architecture is appropriate.p  pSemantically, these would fit best in a UITabBarController since the two views can be considered siblings. But I havent seen a clean way to hide the tab bar in a UITabBarController.p  pMy second idea is to treat one as the main controller and the other as a modal, which I can present automatically without animation when necessary to simulate setting the starting view. My concerns here are related to the wider application design. This controller itself is going to be contained in UIPageViewController, so a modal presentation would need to be modal to the subcontainer and not block paging sideways to more content.p  pI would appreciate any suggestions.p

Negative 13139 pThis might be more of an industry question rather than a specifically technical one, but the answer must consider the technical feasibility.  Ive tried to make the question as pointed as possible.  I am working on a new web application that must protect social security numbers, bank account transactions, etc. Security is essential, as is the appearance of security.  The company I work for, however, is small.  Does it make sense to rely on thirdparty issuers e.g., Google, Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, which are certainly popular but as social media do not convey the seriousness of, say, the banking industry  Or can I realistically expect to implement OAuthOwinKatana as securely as these third parties  Is there another option that is both reliable and popular, without being driven by social media  Or does it make the most sense to implement security myself  I do not have a heavy security background, but am willing to learn it if forms authentication makes the most sense for my situation.p

Negative 13139 pTrying to decide if I need to implement a WF service or just stick with a WCF service that simply invokes a workflow and returns the result. br I dont need correlation handles, or any need to pause the workflow somewhere in the middle of its execution.  It just merely needs to execute a workflow and return the result.  Also, I might want to add a few methods to the service that do not involve workflows at all.  So is there benefit one way or the other, or is a WF service just a pretty wrapper for exposing a workflow as a servicep

Negative 13139 pFirst some backgroundp  p BEGIN BACKGROUNDp  pI am running under CentOS 6.5 Linux on a x8664, and compiling with c GCC 4.4.7 20120313.p  pI have a couple utility programs.  One reads a message with a constant size on its stdin, converts it to a slightly different message, and writes that to its stdout.  The other reads the slightly different message on its stdin, and sends it to a port.  I want to execute a command of the form codecat file  util1  util2code to convert and send messages stored in the file.p  pI originally implemented them both using scodetdcout.writecode and codestdcin.readcode, and it worked fine.  However, I want to make use of a class that can do neat things with the messages and makes my utilities code cleaner.  So, that class takes a codenamecode string and an codeistreamcode or codeostreamcode and sticks them in a codestdmapltstdstring,stdistreamgtcode, or a codestdmapltstdstring,stdostreamgtcode for use later.  Naturally, its a pointer to codestdcincode or a pointer to codestdcoutcode that Im putting in the maps.p  pThen, in codeutil1code, I tell it to send a message to the named stream, and it does, basically, the following yes, I use parens that are unnecessary, because Im paranoidp  p BEGIN SNIPp  precodestdostream ofile  ofilemap[namestring] uint32t      sync    fromSomewhere uint32t      msgLen  sizeofmsg  sizet        outPos  ofilegttellp sizet        nxtPos  ofilegtwritecharampsync,sizeofsync.tellp bool          result  nxtPos  outPos  sizeofsync  if result      outPos  ofilegttellp     nxtPos  ofilegtwritecharampmsgLen,sizeofmsgLen.tellp     result  nxtPos  outPos  sizeofmsgLen   else      stderr ltlt COMPLAINT1 ltlt stdendl    if result      outPos  ofilegttellp     nxtPos  ofilegtwritecharampmsg,msgLen.tellp     result  nxtPos  outPos  msgLen   else      stderr ltlt COMPLAINT2 ltlt stdendl    if result      stderr ltlt COMPLAINT3 ltlt stdendl    ofilegtflush codepre  p END SNIPp  pIn codeutil2code, I tell it to look for a message, and it does, essentially, thisp  p BEGIN SNIPp  precodestdistream ifile   ifilemap[namestring] uint32t      tstSync  0 uint32t      msgSize  0  Yeah, I called it msgLen before. bool          ok       true bool          doflip  false sizet        readLen  0  if ifile      readLen  ifilegtreadcharamptstSync, sizeoftstSync.gcount     ok  readLen  sizeoftstSync gt 0    if ok ampamp ifile      readLen  ifilegtreadcharampmsgSize, sizeofmsgSize.gcount     ok  readLen  sizeofmsgSize gt 0    if ok      if isSynctstSync          if isFlippedSynctstSync              doflip  true          else              ok  false                    if isSyncmsgSize          stdcerr ltlt This is not supposed to be a sync word ltlt stdendl         ok  false           if doflip          msgSize  flipmsgSize         if ok      SizemsgbuftomsgSize  enlarges objects buffer iff its too small.      it would throw an exception if it failed.    if ok ampamp ifile      readLen  ifilegtreadmsgbuf, msgSize.gcount     ok  readLen  msgSize gt 0   codepre  p END SNIPp  pOK, so thats what Im doing.p  p END BACKGROUNDp  pHeres the mysteryp  pWhen I run the first utility to a file codecat file  util1 gt msgFilecode and then feed that file to the second utility codecat msgFile  util2code it works just fine.  So, I know the writes are all happening in the proper order.  But, if I pipe the data between the utilities directly codecat file  util1  util2code it doesnt work  I appear to be reading the sync word over and over again instead of reading messages my This is not supposed to be a sync word message spews out, apparently for every read.  The first utility runs without complaints the COMPLAINT messages dont come out.p  pNow, my understanding of Linux pipes is that, first, theyre supposed to deliver the data in order.  Second, if the buffer is empty, read operations at the terminus block.  Third, if the buffer is full, write operations at the source block.  Fourth, they use a 64K buffer, which is emwayem more than I need for my little messages, so its not like they wouldnt fit.  So, in short, I shouldnt be seeing buffer overflows, and I dont know what else would be different between writing to file and writing to a pipe.p  pSo, it works if I use stdcout.write and stdcin.read with all this code placed directly in my utility.  And it works with codeistreamampstdcincode and codeostreamampstdcoutcode from my maps if I pipe the codeutil1code output to a file and pipe the file to the input of codeutil2code, but it doesnt work with codeistreamampstdcincode and codeostreamampstdcoutcode from my maps if I pipe the codeutil1code output to the input of codeutil2code.p  pThis is driving me nuts  Can anybody tell me what is going onp  pThanksp

Negative 13139 pI have some legacy code, written in Java, that i have ported over to .NET library using IKVMcp  precode..ikvm7.2.4630.5bingtikvmc MST3.0.1.jar targetlibrary platformx64 codepre  pThis creates a library, MST3.0.1.dll, that i can use in my .net application.

Hence, these libraries must be present in the java.lib.path when running MST3.0.1.dll. p  pTo test, I have created a console application and used MST3.0.1.dll. This works fine when i put the dependent dlls in the bin folder, or if i set the environment variable PATH to the directory where the dependent dlls are. p  pHowever, when i run this in Azure either in a datacentre, or in the local emulator i constantly get cannot find one of the dependent dlls in java.lib.path .. ive tried to put the dlls in the bin folder even unzipped the azure package to ensure they are there and also to set the PATH variable ..p  pAm i missing something here Why is there a difference from running MST3.0.1.dll from a Azure deployment compared to a console appstandard web applicationp  pThanksp

Negative 13139 pYesterday I was working on a small prototype and everything was going well.p  pThis morning I tried launching it again, using Chrome as usual, and I see the game screen for a second but then the screen goes black. After that I only see a black screen for every phaser game that is hosted on localhost when using Chrome. p  pPhaser games hosted elsewhere still work, and I can still play games on localhost if I use Firefox or IE, its just Chrome that bugs after playing a specific prototype, and kinda blocks Phaser from running on localhost... Whenever I restart my computer, I can run Phaser games on Chrome again, but when I run this specific prototype I see it for a second and then every game on localhost goes black again...p  pIm trying to find out what went wrong with my prototype, as it was working normally till now. Any ideasp  pThanks,p  p UPDATE p  pI commented my entire prototype to investigate what was causing the problem, and started uncommenting it block by block, testing every part of it.p  pI now have my entire prototype working again as before, even though no changes were made to the code. p  pCould it possibly be a problem with TypeScriptp

I want the score to be 0.5 if headcount is in range and turnover does not exist say.p  pAny help would be appreciated so much,p  pThanks,p  pPascal.p  precodePOST apitestsearch  query                    functionscore                       functions [                                                     filter                                range                                   companyProps.headcount                                      lte 1000,                                     gte 5                                                                                             ,                            weight 1                         ,                                                     filter                                missing                                   field companyProps.headcount                                                           ,                            weight 0                         ,                                                     filter                                range                                   companyProps.turnover                                      lte 1000,                                     gte 100                                                                                             ,                            weight 1                         ,                                                     filter                                missing                                   field companyProps.turnover                                                           ,                            weight 0                                               ],                      query                          filtered                             query                                matchall                             ,                            filter                                bool                                   must [                                                                             bool                                            should [                                                                                               range                                                     companyProps.headcount                                                        lte 1000,                                                       gte 5                                                                                                                                                   ,                                                                                               missing                                                     field companyProps.headcount                                                                                                                                          ]                                                                             ,                                                                             bool                                            should [                                                                                               range                                                     companyProps.turnover                                                        lte 1000,                                                       gte 100                                                                                                                                                   ,                                                                                               missing                                                     field companyProps.turnover                                                                                                                                          ]                                                                                                               ]                                                                                                          ,                      scoremode avg                                      codepre

Negative 13139 pI ran into a 100 named capture group limitation in Pythons regular expression named capture groups.  p  pThe hardcoded limitation is in srecompile.pyp  precodeif p.pattern.groups gt 100     raise AssertionError         sorry, but this version only supports 100 named groups          codepre  pMy understanding is that this limitation is for performance reasons and not necessarily for space limitations. In my case the performance issues are less important than this capability. So I wonder if there is a reasonable way to get around this limitation Possibly by injecting a replacement srecompile.py file with the size check removed Of course, this sounds quite risky and I understand that such an action is not recommended. However, in the short term I need to circumvent this limitation, in the long term I have a nice work around.  Any suggestions on the best solutionp  pThank you in advancep

Negative 13139 pWe have a Python project where our documentation is currently spread across three places we have example Python files, we have Sphinx docs some of which are generated from IPython notebooks and we have IPython notebooks.  We are considering consolidating all this documentation into one set of IPython notebooks.  Ultimately we want to make life easier for both our users and developers by moving all our docs to one place, and using one tool IPython notebook.  And, to be honest, minimising the time required to maintain the docs is a high priority here all the developers are working for free, in their spare time.p  pOne big advantage of Sphinx over IPython notebooks is that Sphinx can automatically generate API documentation from the code using apidoc.  My hunch is that it should be possible to replicate this behaviour in an IPython notebook by writing some code which walks over the librarys python files, extracts the docstrings for display in a notebook including rendering any maths or images and the relevant sections of the docstring parameters, return value, notes etc.  My question is does such a tool already exist  i.e. a tool which can walk over a Python directory, extract the docstrings and display them in an IPython notebook, ideally using pretty HTML formattingp

Negative 13139 pI am trying to convert a String into a Text object and output the value to the Reducer as MapOutputKey. However, in the reducer, the key looks like a black space with valuenot the MapOutputValue as a memory location. However, if i hardcode a String into the text object and send it out, I am able to see the proper values in the Reducer. EDIT Now this is very strange AND interesting. The same program works fine for a smaller dataset,i.e, The text key sent from the mapper is received in the reducer.

And if its possible can i make a counter for the number of browse files that can be added. cause what i want to achieve is that i want the total number of browse files to be 15 only and once it hits 15 the add button will be disabled. So in this case i have 3 sections, i want the total number of browse button across all section to be only 15.

Negative 13139 pI have already looked upon the the usage of interface, abstract classes and inheritance. I see that each have there uses but, I am still kind of confused.p  pI know that generally a class can extend only another class, although some may support multiple inheritance, but it can implement more than one inferface witch is probably the main reason for using an interface. However this class can also be extended by another class If I am correct. I have also seen that absract classes maybe faster than interfaces and can have non static final variables.p  pSo, I am still not sure about when is it better to use witch. Maybe by giving some examples this can be better understood. I am not against using any but I think there is something that I do not see. Further explanations might help as well. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 13139 pSo lets imagine I have a 50 file module, and each one containsp  pcodeexport class ltSomeClassNamegt   content  codep  pThen, I create a root file to simplify usage by reexporting all the files. So it would look likep  precodeexport  from .srcsomeclass1 export  from .srcsomeclass2 export  from .srcsomeclass3  etc codepre  pThen, I run it through TSC to do a common module targeting es5 with descriptor output.p  pSo far so good. I have my codepackage.jsoncode with name codemymodulecode target the outputted codeindex.jscode as the entry point for my module. So I now go and decide to consume this module in another typescript project.p  pSo I do the npm install for it lets pretend codenpm install mymodulecode and it all pulls in, so I now have the d.ts files which were generated, and I have the actual commonjs module so I can use it all. Everything seems to be fine.p  pThen comes the problem. I then decide to make use of the modulep  pcodeimport SomeClass1 from mymodulecodep  pIt blows up as in the TS world, it doesnt know what codemymodulecode relates to, as if we go back and look at the index.js which was outputted, it does not contain an ambient module.p  pSo here is the problem, common modules generally use the package.json as the point of reference when including module names, however TS uses the d.ts files. So then I thought well ok, I need to wrap my reexports in codeindex.tscode in a module, so I tryp  pcodeexport module mymodule   all other reexports  codep  pBut turns out you can only use string module names for ambient modules, and you can only put them within d.ts files, however my d.ts file is generated from the existing codebase.p  pSo here is my dilemma, I can manually go in and add a codedeclare module mymodulecode wrapper to my d.ts, but its not very automated, or I do like the blog posts with ES6 syntax do and reference the file relatively which would end up with lots of codeimport blah from ..nodemodulesmymoduledistindexcode, which hopefully we can all agree is a bit silly.p  pSo I cannot find any sort of other approach which would work in the automated world, as all blog posts and docs on this subject when you use the ES6 syntax all use relative file imports, not imports from when the whole thing has been compiled and shared via d.ts files.p  pSo is there a way here to wrap my reexports in a textual module name Or at least tell the index.d.ts to be contained with an ambient module as remember it will output a d.ts file for every file in the project, but we only care about importing the module via the index.d.ts as that reexports everything.p

Negative 13139 pour code is C MFC.p  pis there an easy way to search an Access Database for a column being used p  pwe have a large database, 100 tables, 300 queries. and i have the honor of moving 5 columns from one of the most used tables, to a new table. I was easily able to search the SQL in our code and fix it. p  pbut i cant find a way to search the queries in the database file for these 5 columns.p  pexample queryGetAllItemNumbers  SELECT tblItems.Number FROM tblItemsp  pthat query is not shown in plain text anywhere, so i cant easily search for the tblItems.Number column being used. So far the easiest way is to run my program, wait for it to crash, then find out which query it crashed on. OR i go through all 300 queries using my eyes to find the bad SQL...OR change .mdb to .txt and find my column names, which leads to some query names.p  pIm hoping someone knows of an Access addin or something similar that can search the SQL inside.p
