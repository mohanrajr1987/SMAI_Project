Positive 75151 pIm using Laravel5 and, I want to create a notification system for my web project. What I want to do is, notifying the user for new notifications such asp  ul lianother user starts following him,li lianother user writes on his wall,li lianother user sends him a message, etc, li ul  pby possibly highlighting an icon on the header with a dropdown menu. The ones such as StackOverflow.p  pI found out the new tutorials on Laracast Realtime Laravel with Socket.io, where a kind of similar thing is achieved by using Node, Redis and Socket.io.p  pIf I choose using socket.io and I have 5000 users online, I assume I will have to make 5000 connections, 5000 broadcastings plus the notifications, so it will make a lot of number of requests. And I need to start for every user on login, on the master blade, is that truep  pIs it a bad way of doing it I also think same thing can be achieved with Ajax requests. Should I tend to avoid using too many continuous ajax requestsp  pI want to ask if Socket.io is a good way of logic for creating such system, or is it a better approach to use Ajax requests in 5 seconds instead Or is there any alternative better way of doing it Pusher can be an alternative, however, I think free is a better alternative in my case.p

Positive 75151 pIve created authentication middleware for a lumen project. The authentication uses an external API, but unless Im mistaken, thats not the issue here.

Positive 75151 pI want to provide my users with the ability to lock in their rate for X number of years. However, this is not possible with Stripe API or Cashier. That is why I will have to do it on my application end. To do this I will need a subscribedat column. I know I can get it straight from Stripe customers subscription field currentperiodstart but it takes too much time to retrieve it and I will need this functionality quite a lot. So, in my subscriptions table, where I have all of Cashiers needed fields stripeid, stripeactive, ..., subscriptionendsat I want to add this subscribedat column. Now, I want to automatically update this value anytime a subscription is create, resume, or cancel. On cancel I need to set the value to NULL.p  pI dont want and its not a good practice to modify Cashiers code. In StripeGateway.php there is a method updateLocalStripeData which fires exactly for these three options but as I said I dont want to modify it.p  pI cannot override the StripeGateway.php method updateLocalStripeData because my Subscription Model does not extend it.p  pSo far the only solution that worked but which I dont really like is to use Model events saving and there retrieve the subscriptions currentperiodstart field and insert it into my Subscription Models subscribedat field.p  pWhat other ways to do thisp

Negative 75151 pI write tools that are used in a shared workspace. Since there are multiple OSs working in this space, we generally use Python and standardize the version that is installed across machines.

Negative 75151 pIm also interested in more general thoughts, but here is my specific problem. In an ASP.NET web app, I am connecting to a 3rdparty via API. The 3rdparty requires that the user login and answer a few configuration questions to set this up. All of the questions except one the user can just choose the default. On one question if the user chooses the default option, my app wont work with the 3rdparty. It is a limitation of their API. It is on their list to fix, but who knows when or if they actually willp  pSo what is the most effective way to give the user instructions in my app that they will follow once they go to this other site Right now I have a screenshot with the option circled in red, follow by some descriptive text. What other techniques have you used in a similar situationp

Negative 75151 pIn the Intel software developers manual it says that interrupt vectors 32255 are usually user defined for external IO devices. In my systems programming class I must develop a simple device driver. My question is how can I define a specific interrupt vector to be used for a specific device Is this done with the BIOSp  pNote we are developing a simple operating system so my situation is quite specific, however, in the end I need to understand how this all happens on an x86 system. Currently our system is set up so that a few interrupt vectors above 32 are assigned to devices like a serial port and keyboard. In reading the datasheet for the Intel 82801EB ICH5 IO controller, specifically the section concerning the 8259 PICs, it says that IRQ15 is the secondary IDE channel. How would that eventually be put on the stack as a interrupt vectorp  pI may just be so confused that this question didnt make sense, so I apologize in advance.p  pEDIT So our systems programming class has a very simple OS, which has kernel routines for installing ISRs to handle specific interrupts given the vector number. In our class last quarter the professor gave us a header file that defined the keyboard as vector number 0x2c or something similar. I am trying to find out how to map the primary andor secondary IDE channel interrupts to various ISRs using our kernel routines. For now, all of the unused interrupt vectors have a default handler that would print messages if an interrupt occurred, so IDE interrupts arent even on at the moment, however that is another question.p
Negative 75151 pIve had this problem that I have been putting off solving, but now is the time.p  pI have a basic dictionary program. It has a UISearchBar and a UITableView. It works the way that it should except when running on the device it causes Keyboard lag. Simulator is fine, of course I have two types of searching. Asyoutype and Onreturn. I find that both take about the same amount of time to return results, but the Asyoutype makes the keyboard lag.p  pI have UISearchBar textDidChange that takes the searchText and sends it to a search method that does all the sqlite lifting, puts the results in an Array. The reloads the table.p  precode voidsearchBarUISearchBar searchBar textDidChangeNSString searchText     ifsearchType  SEARCHASYOUTYPE ampamp [searchText length] gt 2     NSString myKeyword  [NSString stringWithFormat, searchText]     [self searchmyKeyword]     [myTableView reloadData]       codepre  pI limit the results to 50. And I my SQL query uses the LIKE and OR, no way around that yet. p  precodeSELECT WORDID, DEFIN, PINYIN, SIMP, TRAD from WORDS where DEFIN LIKE to dog  OR DEFIN LIKE dog OR DEFIN LIKE dog  ORDER BY DEFIN LIMIT 50 codepre  pIve also tried moving the [myTableView reloadData] into the search method, in hopes that the keyboard would at least not lag. No Joy. And sadly I know that sqlite is basically checking every row, when it uses the like operator. But 34 seconds for 80rows seems kinda slow.p  pAny thoughts, ideas, comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 75151 pI have an application implemented as an ISAPI filter whose behavior needs to change depending on whether it is being loaded by ISA or IIS. During GetFilterVersion it needs to register for SFNOTIFYSENDRAWDATA if being loaded by ISA or SFNOTIFYSENDRESPONSE if being loaded by IIS.p  pThere doesnt seem to be any information about the server passed to GetFilterVersion. Are there some tricks that might identify and distinguish between IIS and ISAp  p[edit]p  pThe application needs to know what server is loading it at initialization time, during the GetFilterVersion call. There is no current request, so attempting to get SERVERVARIABLE from header variables will not work there are no header variables at this point.p  pTo elaborate, my application sets response headers, such as cookies and cache control headers. When running in the context of an ISA server, it must use the SFNOTIFYSENDRAWDATA event to complete this operation, modifying the raw data being sent by the ISA proxy. In IIS, however, using this notification comes with a severe performance penalty, so the application should use SFNOTIFYSENDRESPONSE. SFNOTIFYSENDRESPONSE will not work with ISA because this event does not get fired for proxied responses, only for responses which originate from the ISA itself, such as error pages. Finally, registering for events happens once during GetFilterVersion and cannot be modified once the filter is loaded.p  pSo the app needs to know, during initialization, when it decides to register for SFNOTIFYSENDRESPONSE or SFNOTIFYSENDRAWDATA, whether it is being loaded by IIS or ISA.p

Negative 75151 pI recently came in contact with this interesting problem. You are given a string containing just the characters codecode, codecode, codecode, codecode, code[code and code]code, for example, code[]code, you need to write a function which will check validity of such an input string, function may be like this br  codebool isValidchar scode br these brackets have to close in the correct order, for example codecode and code[]code are all valid but code]code, code[]code and codecode are notp  pI came out with following On time and On space complexity solution, which works finep  ol liMaintain a stack of characters.li liWhenever you find opening braces codecode, codecode OR code[code push it on the stack.li liWhenever you find closing braces codecode, codecode OR code]code , check if top of stack is corresponding opening bracket, if yes, then pop the stack, else break the loop and return false.li liRepeat steps 2  3 until end of the string.li ol  pThis works, but can we optimize it for space, may be constant extra space, I understand that time complexity cannot be less than On as we have to look at every character.p  pSo my question is can we solve this problem in O1 spacep

Negative 75151 pHeyas.  Im using modproxy with apache2 provide vhost ability to multiple servlet apps running on the local machine.  It works fine, for the most part.  Requests come into apache then are directed to the application bound on a port on localhost.  The app receives the request and responds, which is delivered back to the client by apache.  p  pThe problem Im having is that the application delivers 500s on errors, and modproxy stomps on them.  Often these errors are caused in a ajax request and the error is handled in client side javascript.  For example, a call to a server side createObjectname might throw a NameNotUniqueException , which is delivered back as a 500.  The client javascript might then display an appropriate error message.  p  pWhen an error is thrown by the application resulting in a 500 response to modproxy, then apache stomps the error message and returnsp  pb500 Internal Server Errorbp  h1Internal Server Errorh1  pThe server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.p  p.. the stock apache server side error message.  p  pI want modproxy to pass the original 500 back through to the client.  Is there a directive Ive missed which prevents clobbering of the 500p  pTIAp

Negative 75151 pA friend and I are creating a card game for the iPhone, and in these early days of the project, Im developing a Deck class and a Card class to keep up with the cards. Im wanting to test the shuffle method of the Deck class, but I am not able to show the values of the cards in the Deck class instance. The Deck class has a NSArray of Card objects that have a method called displayCard that shows the value and suit using console outputprintf or NSLog. In order to show what cards are in a Deck instance all at once, I am using this, code[deck makeObjectsPerformSelectorselectordisplayCard]code, where deck is the NSArray in the Deck class. Inside of the Deck class, nothing is displayed on the console output. But in a test file, it works just fine. Heres the test file that creates its own NSArrayp  precodeimport ltFoundationFoundation.hgt import card.h  int main int argc, char argv      NSAutoreleasePool pool  [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init]     Card two  [[Card alloc] initValue2 withSuitd]     Card three  [[Card alloc] initValue3 withSuith]     Card four  [[Card alloc] initValue4 withSuitc]     NSArray deck  [NSArray arrayWithObjectstwo,three,four,nil]      Ok, what if we release the objects in the array before theyre used     I dont think this will work...

The problem I have is that the back and forward navigation is not working. IE click on a link and then click the back button does not actually navigate back. It changes the url though. The other thing which leads me to believe I am doing something fundamentally wrong is I have inserted the code.address.titlethis.attrtitlecode and it does not actually change the address. p  pJquery here p  precodeswNavlist a.address  swNavlist a.clickfunction       swBody.block      messageLoading,     css           border none,          padding 15px,          backgroundColor 000,          webkitborderradius 10px,          mozborderradius 10px,          opacity .5,          color fff              var contentshow  this.attrhref.replace,        .ajax         method get,url contentshow,         bvLanguage          success functionhtml so, if data is retrieved, store it in html              swBody.htmlhtml show the html inside .content div             swBody.unblock             .address.titlethis.attrtitle           ,success         error function             swBody.unblock             swBody.block                  messageError Encountered,                 css                       border none,                      padding 15px,                      backgroundColor 000,                      webkitborderradius 10px,                      mozborderradius 10px,                      opacity .5,                      color fff                  ,                  timeout1000                                 close .ajax     swNavlist.topZIndex  end navigation   codepre  pHTML here p  precodelthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml langen xmllangengt ltheadgt     ltTitlegtSwebits Homelttitlegt     ltlink hrefcssswCss.css relstyleSheet typetextcss gt     ltscript typetextjavascript srcjsjquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascript srcjsjquery.pngFix.jsgtltscriptgt      ltscript typetextjavascript srcjsjquery.blockUI.jsgtltscriptgt      ltscript typetextjavascript srcjsjquery.topzindex.min.jsgtltscriptgt      ltscript typetextjavascript srcjssw.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascript srcjsjquery.address1.3.2.min.jsautoUpdate1gtltscriptgt    ltheadgt  ltbodygt         ltdiv idswHeadgt             ltdiv classleftColgtltdivgt             ltdiv classcenterColgt                   ltdiv classnavigationgt                     ltul idswNavlistgt                         ltli idactivegtlta hrefhome.html idcurrent titleSwebits HomegtHomeltagtltligt                         ltligtlta hrefwebd.html titleSwebits Web DevelopmentgtWeb Designltagtltligt                         ltligtlta hrefbla.html titlewebs.htmlgtWeb Systemsltagtltligt                         ltligtlta href titlehosting.htmlgtHostingltagtltligt                         ltligtlta href titlephoto.htmlgtPhotographyltagtltligt                         ltligtlta href titleportfolio.htmlgtPortfolioltagtltligt                         ltligtlta href titlenetwork.htmlgtOur Networkltagtltligt                         ltligtlta href titlecontact.htmlgtContactltagtltligt                     ltulgt                 ltdivgt             ltdivgt             ltdiv classrightColgtltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdiv idswContainer classclearfixgt           ltdiv idswCenter classclearfixgt               ltdiv idswBodygt                 ltphp                     includehome.html                 gt             ltdivgt              ltdiv idswFootergt              ltdivgt          ltdivgt      ltdivgt  ltbodygt codepre  pp  pLastly I tried to implement an if statement so that if the target is blank the page redirects to error.html but that did not appear to work either. p  pI appreciate the helpp

After looking at Djangos default routing behavior in a hrefhttpcode.djangoproject.combrowserdjangotagsreleases1.3djangodbutils.pyL125codedjango.db.utils.ConnectionRoutercodea, we found that even though we expected codefruitappcode to be on the codedefaultcode database by default, the codeinstancecode hint passed to codedbforreadcode for foreign key lookups put it on the codenewsdbcode database. We added a second router to ensure codefruitappcode models were always read from the codedefaultcode database.  A codeForeignKeycode subclass is only used to fix the codeForeignKey.validatecode method. If Django wanted to support foreign keys across databases, I would say this is a Django bug.

Negative 75151 pIs it possible to implement a subview of a UITableViewCell on the left side of the cell that crossfades when the table enters the editing mode Another problem I face is that the bounds of the cell.textLabel are readonly.

I could also have a single factory for all the different kinds of events, but that doesnt seem too right, also.p  pfor the C crowd, Im not talking about .NETs events here. This was just an example to get to the point, just think of them as regular classesp  pThis was just an example.

Negative 75151 pWe have ActiveMQ onto which the events that happen in the system are published. The project involves users adding entities to their watchlist and whenever there are events on those entities I would like an email to be sent out to the interested participants. p  pThe usecase roughly translates to some one expressing an interest in a product information page on the catalog and an email being sent whenever any activity happens on that product price goes down, there is a positive review etc.,. I had modelled this interaction as a Camel route.p  pSo, for example, if the user says email me whenever this products rating equals 5, then the following route would be added to the camel contextp  precodefromactivemqtopicevents.product.save.filter.xpathobject[ltobject idgt]rating.isEqualTo5.toemailltusers emailgt codepre  pSimilarly if the user wants to be notified whenever there is a new comment on a product, another route would be created and so on. This could potentially, end up creating thousands of routes as each user starts adding their watches of interest.p  pSome questions that I have arep  ul lipIs this an acceptable way of creating dynamic routes One option I am considering is to use recipient lists. But I havent been able to come up with a solution that would make it elegant to route messages to the bean that would return the recipient list. For example for the case explained above would the bean have a bunch of ifelse to see which recipient list to returnpli lipThe camelcontext has a method to load routes from a xml file but no method to persist the existing routes.

Negative 75151 pI am doing some heavy computation in my android application. Since i dont want to block the UIthread, I do the computation in a seperate WorkerThread, which extends Thread. This works fine. But i have trouble stopping the thread. The normal way to stop a thread is either using interrupt oder a volatile variable to tell the thread, that it should end. But this works only in Threads with some kind of loop. I am doing computation in the thread by using external libraries and I cannot put the isInterruptedcheck into this library. The bad way to stop a thread is using the stopMethode, which is deprecated, but in my case the right way, since the thread manipulates only internal values.

Negative 75151 pstrongeditsub2substrong Taking the hint that de Bruijn indices might be easier to work with, Ive reformulated much of the internal representation of formulae to use a mixed de Bruijn representation emalaem Connor McBrides paper. This greatly simplified some algorithms regarding syntax that had to deal with equivalence, but made others more complicated. In any case, this means that free variables can be standardized apart and bound variables have canonical names represented by their binding distance. This isnt totally satisfactory, but its at least a better start.p  pstrongeditsub1substrong I realized the problem constraints arent sufficient to guarantee standardization of variables. In particular, iteration of quantifiers means that variables in binders must be standardized apart first. So there is probably no escaping a solution that requires multiple passes over each abstract syntax tree. The suggestion to use de Bruijn indices is a fairly good solution generally, but it wont give standardization easily without breaking the notation and its utility.p  pstrongoriginalstrong Let emVem be an infinite set of variables indexed by the natural numbers, emfvem denote the free variables of , and embvem denote the bound variables of , for any firstorder formula . The problem Im trying to solve is the following.p  blockquote   pLet  and  be firstorder formulae. Find substitutions sub1sub and sub2sub such that a emfvemsub1sub, emfvemsub2sub, embvemsub1sub, and embvemsub2sub are disjoint b the union of emfvemsub1sub, emfvemsub2sub, embvemsub1sub, and embvemsub2sub is isomorphic to an initial segment of the natural numbers and c all variables in embvemsub1sub are less than all variables in embvemsub2sub are less than all variables in emfvemsub1sub are less than all variables in emfvemsub2sub.p blockquote  pThe difficulty is that the set of bound and free variables in a formula isnt necessarily disjoint, and quantifiers may be iterated, meaning that naive substitution produces accidental variable capture, and so forth.p  pAn inefficient solution is the following. Given  and , first standardize apart the free variables of  and  such that all free variables in the standardized terms are greater than the largest bound variable plus the number of binding operators in  and , giving  and . Then rename the bound variables of  starting from xsub0sub. Then the bound variables of . Then the free variables of . Then the free variables of .p  pWhat I would like is a more efficient method of satisfying the problem constraints.

However, the additional constraint is giving me trouble.p

Negative 75151 pHi guys   I was wondering wether anyone knew of a concrete example of a DSL in Clojure which replaces the abstraction and readability of a good OO program written in, say , Java. p  pIve been trying to take an OO data model which is bean based, with very abstract methods which hide underlying implementations into a clojure moeity ... p  pI know that macros and higher order functions exist , however, Ive never seen them applied to a real world data set which is easily understood for example a courseregistration system, or a car dealership, or a billing system, or something of the sort, recall the infamous JPetStore examples which Hibernate and Ibatis popularized in the last decade.p  pAnyways... My basic question is  p  pDo any domainspecific templates exist for learning how to model real world systems in Clojure with protocols and higherorder functions  p

Negative 75151 pIm having a hell of a time using CGImageCreateWithImageInRect to crop a photo. My app has the user move  enlarge an image till it fills a 316 x 316 view, then I want it to crop off any area outside the box and save the image as a UIImage. I determine the crop origin by taking the absolute value of the x and y imageview origin as that brings me back to 0,0 of the view  box that contains the imageview. Below is the codep  precode    CGRect croppedRect  CGRectMakefabswidthDistanceToOrigin, fabsHeightDistanceToOrigin, 316, 316     CGImageRef croppedImageRef  CGImageCreateWithImageInRectimage.CGImage, croppedRect      UIImage croppedImage  [UIImage imageWithCGImage croppedImageRef scale 1  imageScale orientation image.imageOrientation]     CGImageReleasecroppedImageRef  codepre  pThis is driving me crazy, I just cant get it to crop the area I want. Ive got it to scale correctly, but the problem seems to be with the x and y origin of the crop rect, its quite a bit off from the area it should be taking and sometimes I get weird results. p  pAlso, it seems for images taken with the phones camera, I have to multiply everything in my crop rect by 2 for it to be the correct size. Very weird.p  pSo Im wondering, does anyone know how to fix this, or does anyone possible have a better way of cropping and please keep in mind that I need to crop an area within my photo. Thanksp

Negative 75151 pI have a new App to launch in the near future. The App is going to have different versions for different Territorys App Store, in sense of UI language and part of App content.p  pMy question is whether I can create different Apps different bundle IDs and different Apps iTunes Application Name but with the same App bundle name.p  pI am doing this because If I include all the UI images for all the languages in one binary and control the language change with code, the App size will be over 20 MG, which I dont want. So, I am deciding to create, compile and submit different binaries separately, at the same time, setting their available App store through Rights and Pricing and select certain countries for each version. I will ensure that two versions of my app wont appear in the same App store to confuse users.p  pIs this possible Has anyone done this beforep  pThanksp
Negative 75151 pI was trying to minimize the code size in my iOS 4 game, so I tried enabling all the striprelated commands, and using the Os flag.p  pHowever, strangely I still found that the binary was quite big, and when I manually tried to strip the binary using the console using the strip command, it actually reduced it from 18 mb to 12.3 mb.p  pDoes Xcode actually use a different strip mechanism, or anything like that The problem with using the console strip command is that it gives a message saying that it invalidates the code sign, so I wonder if its possible to get the code signing working after this strip command.p

Ideally MenuItem would get a property of type codeSystem.Windows.Input.KeyGesturecode so I can simply writep  precodeShortcut  new KeyGesture Key.D, ModifierKeys.Control  codepre  pwhich would result in the Command of the item being called upon hitting CtrlD in the window that owns the menu, and which would also lead to automatically display CtrlD in the menu.p  pHowever Im lost here I wanted to set the MenuItem.InputBindings collection via databinding but it is getonly. How can I get items into it anyway Or is there an MVVM framework that already supports something like this Most qampa I found on keyboard shortcuts are all about setting the shortcuts through xaml, which is of no help.p  pemUpdateemp  pSearching for relaycommand vs routeduicommand and relaycommand keygesture etc did reveal enough information to come up with a working though hacky solution. There are definitely other and better ways out there, but at the moment this is ultra low priority for me and does the job perfectly. I added two properties to the MenuItem class like thisp  precodeUpon setting a Gesture, the original command is replaced with a RoutedCommand since that automatically gives us proper display of the keyboard shortcut. The RoutedCommand simply calls back into the original Command. It also sets the CommandBinding property, which still has to be added to the CommandBindingCollection of either the bound control or one of it ancestors public InputGesture Gesture    set        var origCmd  Command     if origCmd  null        return     var routedCmd  new RoutedCommand Header,       typeof System.Windows.Controls.MenuItem ,       new InputGestureCollection  value       CommandBinding  new CommandBinding routedCmd,        sender, args  gt origCmd.Execute args.Parameter ,        sender, args  gt  args.CanExecute  origCmd.CanExecute args.Parameter        Command  routedCmd      CommandBinding created when setting Gesture public CommandBinding CommandBinding  get private set  codepre  pSo this gives the functionality I asked for originally ie adding keyboard shortcuts in code where they are easily configurable etc. All that is left is to register the commandbindings. At the moment this is done simply by adding all of them to Application.Current.MainWindow.CommandBindings.p

And than the rails routing guide for example has a hole lot more text to show you what else you can do to tweak around with resourceful routing.

Negative 75151 pIn my application Im doing gamma, brightness and contrast corrections defined by the user. Now I was wondering whether there is a standard order of doing this or not. p  pIt may sound trivial but I couldnt find anything regarding this.

Negative 75151 pstrongtldr summarystrong Given a stream of bytes representing a string in an unknown encoding, what encodings and in what order should I attempt to interpret the bytes to get the best chance of finding the right encodingp  h3Example of the Problemh3  pI have a file codearrows.txtcode that I happen to know has been saved using UTF8 with the singlecharacter content of codecode. If I pretend that I emdo not knowem what the encoding of this file is, the following Ruby code on Windows failsp  precodes  IO.readfoo.txt p s.encoding,        gt ltEncodingIBM437gt   s.validencoding, gt true   s.chars.toa       gt [xE2, x87, x88] codepre  pIt fails because it tells me that the file actually had the contents codecode, and that everything is fine the encoding is valid.p  h3Real World Scenarioh3  pI have a hrefhttpnginx.net relnofollowNginxa log files and Akamai log files that dont have any particular encoding for the queries they record, which I need to process and store data for in a database as UTF8. Most of the time interpreting each line as UTF8 produces a string with a valid encoding, but sometimes it does not.p  pI want to ask Ruby to try a variety of encodings for each line, to find one that is valid and emlikelyem but of course not guaranteed to be correct.p  h3Failed Attempth3  pI originally wrote the following codep  precodedef guessencoding str, resultutf8, encodings     Try every encoding if none were passed in   encodings  Encoding.list if encodings.empty     Keep forcing a new encoding until we find one that is valid   unless encodings.find e str.forceencodinge ampamp str.validencoding      raise None of the supplied encodings was valid   end     Convert from the valid encoding to the desired, replacing bad characters   str.encoderesult, invalid replace, undef replace end codepre  pThe problem with this is that the very first encoding in codeEncoding.listcode is codeASCII8BITcode, which is valid for all streams of bytes. Thus, if I use my code above and call codes2  guessencodingscode the result is the string codecode for my threebyte doublearrow character above.p  h3Finally, the Questionsh3  pWhat order should I test encodings in to provide the greatest chance of having the first codevalidencodingcode be the correct one Which common encodings are the pickiest about the bytes used, such that I should try them first, and which common encodings are completely permissive, such that I should try them lastp  pAre there any other heuristics I should use in guessing for correctness Is it more likely to be correct if a particular encoding results in fewer characters than anotherp

Negative 75151 pit seems that whenever I try to store a qt dialog screen into a static variable the program crashes. With a debug error complaining that a QPaintDevice cant be created before the QMainApplication.p  pAs this error happened before the main was loop was entered I took it the problem was with the static variables. Well and it was the only thing I added since last build.p  pLet me first try to explain how I use it. Basically I have an tree origination from some external xml files. I wish to display data from that tree. However depending on the actual place in the tree the data has to be drawn differently. Using completely different dialogs.p  pSo what I started to create was a static map. This map holds as key the tree location regexified to something like a  c d  spaces denote branching. And as value the correct dialog should be pointed to.p  pThe first idea was to simply use pointers to dialog screens. And then the function that looks up the variable simply executes the dialog screen. However this resulted into the error shown above.p  pNow I started using an intermediate proxy function, where the function just creates the dialog screen and calls it. And the static map just holds a pointer to this function. Something likep  precodeint AskGUIFnGenStdconst GMProjectpTreeamp tOut, const GMProjectpTreeamp tIn const      stduniqueptrltMWGenStdgt boxnew MWGenStdamptOut, amptIn     return boxgtexec  codepre  pHowever this seems very verbose not only do I have to create all the modal windows, but I have to add another proxy function for each dialog screen. Is there a cleaner way to do this Id like to prevent using proxy functionsp

Negative 75151 pI have been using a few crossplatform GUI libraries such as FLTK, wxWidgets, GTK, however I feel like none fulfil my needs as I would like to create something that looks the same regardless of the platform I understand that there will be people against building GUIs that dont have a native look on the platforms but thats not the issue here.   To build my controls, I usually rely on basic shapes provided by the library and make my way up binding amp coding everything together...p  pSo I decided to give it a try and do some opengl for 2D GUI programming as it would still be crossplatform. With that in mind, I couldnt help to notice that the applications that I have written using wxWidgets amp FLTK usually have a average RAM consume of 12MB, whereas a very basic openGL window with a simple background ranges from 6 to 9 MB.p  pThis brings me to the actual question for this thread, I thought that all the rendering of the screen was made using either opengldirect under the covers.p  pCould someone please explain or link me some sort of article that could give me some insight of how these things actually workp  pThanks for readingp

Negative 75151 pIm making a piano application in Java. This is one of the functions,p  precodepublic void playOnceint time      play     doClicktime     stop   public void play      channel[0].noteOnnote, 60   public void stop      channel[0].noteOffnote  codepre  pIll provide a minimal working example if necessary, but I wanted to make sure its not an obvious issue. The problem is that playOnce is called in a while loop. playOnce is in a Key class, and each Key has a different note. In each iteration of the while loop, playOnce is called on a different key. Once all the keys have been played, it stops.p  pThe doClick method correctly pressed the key, but its not released until all the keys have been played. In fact, while the keys are being played, you cant do anything, even press the pause button. For this problem, I guess I could put the entire loop in a different thread, but I dont think that type of solution will allow the key to be released.p  pEDIT Yea, I figured out I need a new thread to get other actions to work, but I still need a fix for doClick.

Negative 75151 pEDIT Im sorry Stack Overflow, but Im retarded. codefractexoffsetcode  codefracttexoffsetcode, and it works fine on ATI cards, and also nVidia cards when codeversioncode is specified now. This must be why most of the programmers I know dont have much hair left.p  pp  pIm working on a game for a school project. Its a vertical scroller, so one of the required features was a scrolling background. I tried a few approaches, but I eventually wrote a simple fragment shader this is the first time I touch shader programming, so dont really know what Im doingp  precodeuniform sampler2D tex uniform float texoffset  void main      vec2 coords  vec2glTexCoord[0].s, glTexCoord[0].t  fractexoffset     glFragColor  texture2Dtex, coords  codepre  pI use a hrefhttpsfmldev.org relnofollowSFMLa so I dont touch much of the stuff behind the scenes, but the texture Im using is passed to the codetexcode variable, and the codetexoffsetcode is generated in my game loop by taking the total elapsed seconds multiplied by a factor to control the scrolling speed.p  pThis appears to do what its supposed to it indefinitely scrolls a seamless repeating texture in one direction. It works on my laptop, and it works on my home computer, which both have nVidia cards. However, when we tried to run it on a group members computer with an ATI card, it simply did nothing. I did some googling and it seems like the nVidia cards accept nonstandard GLSL code as well, which might explain the issues with compatibility. I find it difficult to find good tutorialsexplanation on GLSL as most of the stuff I dig up is from version 1.21.4 and Im apparently using syntax that was deprecated in version 3 glFragColor, glTexCoord. However, when I tried to set codeversioncode to 120 or 140 or whatever, the shader also stopped working on my nVidia computers.p  pSo, to try to phrase this into question form what is wrong about this shader code Is there any way to debug the syntax, and how do I turn on standards mode for my nVidia cards if this is possiblep

Negative 75151 pIve a serious problem with android sqlite database and concurrent writing. For better explanations, I will give you a real life examplep  pIve an desktop widget, where Im showing a list of items from my database and on background I have DataService, which in regular intervals collects fresh data from my remote server, and update my database with them. So  when i click on some item in list, i need to update clicked item do write operation in database. BUT when i click on item exactly in moment, when DataService is updating fresh data in my database, it of course logs an error like thisp  precodeandroid.database.sqlite.SQLiteException error code 5 database is locked codepre  pNormally its hard to simulate, but if u schedule DataService to run for example every 10 seconds just for demonstration, u can simulate this error very easily.p  pAnd my question is, how to handle this I read in docs, that if there are two write events in same time, only first will be executed, second will be logged as an error. Its sounds strange, there must be another options, for example the second write would wait until first write finish.

Negative 75151 pI have a complex UIBezierCurve which I need to draw once with some particular line parameters, and then draw it again as overlay with other line parameters, but also I need the last part of the curve to be slightly shorter than in previous one.p  pTo do this I want to create the curve by codeaddLineToPointcode, codemoveToPointcode up to the last part, then make a copy of this curve and add the final segments of the line differently in original and copied curves.

Negative 75151 pWe have an App based on Apples a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiossamplecodeGLCameraRippleIntroductionIntro.html relnofollowGLCameraRipplea example which does realtime image processing on video from the iOS devices camera. p  pApples Instruments reports that OpenGL is running at 3040fps which is one frame every 2530 ms.

Negative 75151 pI am using Eclipse Tomcat6 integration to test my webapp. I start and stop my Tomcat instance from the Servers view in Eclipse. However, quite often, a running instance of tomcat seems to detach itself from the integration where the Servers tab says that its stopped.

When I open the Task Manager, I can see that eclipse is still running and have to kill it manually before I can use the Servers view again.p  pI havent been able to figure out a pattern but it happens very often now.p

When I turned of HTTP chunking as the article suggests, the error message went away but the problem remained.  p  pDoes anyone know what is going on and how this might be fixedp  pUPDATEp  pIn working with this problem I believe I have uncovered a bug in how the cookie that is used to store the flash object.  The cookie it stores is named strongcsfcfcstrong, and the strongpathstrong parameter to the cookie is the root of my application, in my case A. p  pHowever when it fails, I get a second strongcsfcfcstrong cookie, this time with the path parameter as A.  My working theory is that the cookie generator is sometimes adding an extra  to the path parameter, which means that the cookie is not seen on the next request even though the browser sent it. p  pIt is notable that this happens very intermittently.  I do NOT always get the strongJSF1095strong message but I do get the extra cookie every time I looked.p  pI dont know if this is a Mojarra bug or a Glassfish bug, but I am adding the Mojarra tag to this post.   I am not familiar with the bug data bases for those pro.ducts, but could someone here comment on what the next step should bep  pI would appreciate any suggestions for a work aroundp

The problem that this presents is that my Domain ModelsClasses are defined in the Domain layer but the Context which creates and returns them is in the Data layer. In order for my context to know to return a Widget object it would need a reference to the Domain layer which defined the Widgetp  pbMy failed solutionb  My solution was to create interfaces for each Domain Model and place them in the data layer. The context would return ... IdbSet ... These interfaces would, in turn, be implemented by the Domain Models, therefore keeping my data layer from directly needing to reference my domain which causes illegal circular references anyway. The domain models were originally contructed using ADO.NET DbContext Generator wWCF Support T4 templates. This process resulted in the inclusion of the [KnownTypetypeofIWidgetPiece] at the beginning of of the widget class defin ition. A Widget has a navigation property ...

Negative 75151 pstrongIdeal Situationstrongp  pOften while working on a Symfony2 project I will spot something I want to change in one of my dependencies.

If I submit a pull request then it may take quite some time before I can actually use the code in vendors, which is actually a deterrent from contributing my new functionality.p  pstrongHow I do it nowstrongp  pThe way I typically contribute to a bundle is to make a fork, put the fork in a barebones symfony standardedition app, make the change and then submit a pull request.p  pstrongPut fork in codecomposer.jsoncodestrongp  pThe only solution I can think of, is removing the packagist dependency of the bundle I am editing, and then including my fork with composer as a package from github.

The hard thing is, it should account for transparancy in the images.p  pSo far, I have tried using a hrefhttpsgithub.comesmartdevsmartJQueryHitTest relnofollowthis plugina for JQuery, but it keeps returning an error something with a function insde the plugin itself. I can also write my own hitTestfunction, but the problem is that I have no idea how to look for transparancy using javascript.p
Negative 75151 pI have a codeUIViewcode inside a View Controller, of course, and inside this codeUIViewcode, I have a codeUIScrollViewcode. codeUIScrollViewcode contains some images and buttons. One of the buttons uses the modal Action Segue and opens up a codeUIViewcode with a codeMapViewcode inside, and a back button at the bottom that takes you back to the previous codeUIViewcode. But upon going back from the codeMapViewcode to the codeUIViewcode, the codeUIScrollViewcode strongdoes not scroll anymorestrong like it did before going to the MapView and back.

It works.p  pWhat I am now trying to do is account for screen orientation changes.. If while the ASyncTask is running the orientation is changed, the app crashes.p  pAs suggested here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13977509retainingasynctaskfromactivitynotfragment13977685comment1930282113977685Hidden Fragmentsa I have been trying to implement a hidden fragment which saves the state of my ASyncTask. So what I have done is set it up so in onResume of my Activity i call a function p  precode    static LoadDataFromURL thedata  null static JSONArray pubdata  null private static final String TAG  RetainFragment  public RetainFragment   public static RetainFragment findOrCreateRetainFragmentFragmentManager fm       RetainFragment fragment  RetainFragment fm.findFragmentByTagTAG     if fragment  null          fragment  new RetainFragment         fm.beginTransaction.addfragment, TAG.commit  add this          return fragment  codepre  pwhich essentially saves my data.p  pBasically what this means is that if i rotate my screen i dont call my ASyncTask again.. the screen just rotates.. it works perfectly.p  pIf however I go back to the main menu and then click on the activity again the screen returns blank but does not crash. My understanding is that the data is retained as an object in the fragment, but on reloading the activity afresh the data needs to be set again.. I.E onLoadComplete needs to be called to populate the listmap..p  pSo i concluded that if initially after the ASyncTask completes i save the returned data in my hidden fragment onRetainInstance, then i could simply call onLoadComplete and pass it..p  pThe problem is, in this situation seemingly the fragment has not been called yet, as such the tags are null, and calling the callbacks within onLoadComplete crashes the app.p  pI have been banging my head over this for ages.p  pMy ASyncTask is in a seperate class LoadDataFromURL What i want to achieve is as follows  a fragmentviewpager whereby on screen rotate the ASyncTask is retained on rotateattached to the new activity, and if it has completed before it shouldnt be run again..p  pCould anyone advise.p  pMany Thanksp  pEDITp  pHaving changed the variables in my secret fragment to public variables, everything has seemingly come together.. BUT because im not 100 sure howwhen things are called, I dont fully understand WHY it works..p  pSo.. I call findOrCreateRetainFragment and it either creates a new secret fragment or returns the current instance.p  pIf it is returning a current instance, i dont call my async task again. If it is not, I call my asynctask and load the data.p  pWith this setup, when i load the activity and rotate the screen, it rotates as expected woop.p  pNow, when i go back to the main menu and then click the activity again, it calls the async task.p  pMy understanding is that on rotate the async task is not called again, and the viewpager is somehow saving the fragments.p  pOn the other hand, when i go back my activity is destroyed, as is my secret fragment, and as such when i click on it again it loads the data. THis is essentially what i want..p  pHave i understood this correctlyp  pThanksp

Now, I have some folders on server which have xml files. I have to create an Asp website that searches with folder names and retrieve other information from the particular xml file which is selected. I assume this will be easier if it is in database .mdf so that it can be accessed using sql server and through stored procedures to access the information in xml files..p  pNow the question is how to convert the xml files on server to .mdf to perform search operations on my asp website.. please guide me .. and one more thing is the folders will be updated daily...so,need something which does conversion during retrieval .. please guide me with best possible wayp

Negative 75151 pTrying to do some customization to my Actionbar w Actionbar Sherlock..p  pI have an existing custom View which overrides on Draw, and updates itself with the GPS status based on Accuracy. p  pI want it as the right most menu option available to users.  So I believe customView is out.p  pI have tried to implement this as a MenuItem on the Action bar, which I was able to do successfully, by extending Drawable instead of extending a View or ImageView.p  pMy issue seems to be w extending drawable, I cant invalidate my view to refresh, when a GPS accuracy changes.

Negative 75151 pLets say I have a chart with 2 series on it.  Then for each series, I have a checkbox to say whether I want to see them or not.  Assume that I originally plot both, and afterwards, wanted to hide either of them.  What is the best way to do thisp  pI know I could just codeClearcode it and then codeAddXYcode them back in, but is there a faster way to do itp  pMy attempted ideasp  pBR1.  Set a visibility property to truefalse depending on checkbox. BRThere is No visibility Property BRBR2.  Copy Points Collection to a variable, clear, and put back in. BRcodeSeries[].Pointscode is readonly BRBR3.  Copy Series to a variable, clear the points, and put back in. BRApparently it stores the Series as a reference when I try this, and I cannot find a copy command.p  pSo I am apparently going about this the wrong way.  How would you dynamically allow chart to have different series hiddenp

I downloaded HEX editor a hrefhttpwww.hhdsoftware.comfreehexeditor relnofollowhttpwww.hhdsoftware.comfreehexeditora to edit my binary file. Then I searched for the string where the 0xff 0xd8 was in may case in line 0000000288. This is supposed to be the beginning of a JPEG file. Then I deleted everything that came before of that also the six pair of zeros within the same line. Then I saved m edits and tried again to open it with an image processing program in my case, Im usin ENVI, and....IT WORKS Now the binary file is red as an image file The problem now is that I have plenty of those files 302, and I need to edit all of them. Moreover, they each contain more than one jpeg, so I need to modify each one ore times. Guess I need to improve my programming knowledge...p
Negative 75151 pHye..I managed to create search function to search using multiple keywords. The problem is the keywords must be exist inside my database column that i had set. If i search using 3 keywords which is 2 keywords match inside database but 1 more keyword is not exist. The result was displayed nothing. p  pHow could I ignore the non existing keywords just take the keywords that exists inside my database only.

So my question isp  pWhy include theoretical subjects that play an important role in Computer Science in the field of Software Engineering Or how can I apply the knowledge of PDA,TM,P,NP and so on in developing software I fail to see the link between the two.  p

Negative 75151 pIm using Delphi XE4 Architect Delphi Xe3 is ok as well I need to find a smart solution to the following problem and I would like to use one of these frameworks kbmMW or RemOjects SDK  DataAbstract or RealThinClientp  pCurrently I have an application using a very simple MSSQL database on a site A that is used by users of a site B through the remote desktop. The application sometimes needs to show some pictures and also view some PDF, but it is mostly text data entry.p  pThere is no particular reason for me to use MSSQL, but it is a database that I found already active and populated and I have not built it myself.  And now, it would be complicated to change it. Database is not important, not using specific features nor stored procedures nor triggersp  pUsers of the Site B are connected to the A site via a network connection very slow  and occasionally the connection is not available for a few hours and up to one day this is the major problem. The situation of the connection, unfortunately, can not be improved for various reasons.p  pThe database is quite simple has many tables that hardly ever change, about ten instead undergo daily updates and potentially they may be subject to competing changes.p  pMainly the records of these tables contain data that are locked in update from a single user to edit some fields and then he saves releasing the lock.p  pI would like to get something very different to optimize performance.p  pUsers of the A site have higher priority, they are more important, because the A site is the headquarters.p  pI would like to have a copy of the database at Site A to Site B, so that users of site B can work in local, much faster without using the remote desktop connecting to the site A. The RDP protocol is not very optimized and in any case if the connection is absent, users could not work.p  pSynchronize and update databases lock records between the two databases may not be a big problem.p  pBasically when a user of the Site B acquires edit a record in the database B, obviously a user of the site A should not be able to modify the same record on the database of the site A.  This should also work in the opposite direction of course.p  pMy big problem is figuring out how handling to the best the situation that occurs when the connection between B and A is not available for some hours. And transactionevents is increasing on site B. Events on Site A have generally priority on collision on events on Site B. p  pUsers of the Site B must be able to continue working.  When the connection becomes active, the changes should be sent to the database at Site A. Obviously this can result in conflicts, but the changes made on the record possibly by users B can be discarded or it can be done under the supervision of a selective merge and approval record by record user of the site B.p  pWell, I hope the scenario is almost explained clearly.p  pAdditional infosp  ul lipDB schema is very simple, only tables, no triggers, stored procedure.

Negative 75151 pI am busy doing some research and I need to do a comparison between two methods of system monitoring. I have to compare the total memory of overhead and computation required when queries are made to an external software package i.e one that I did not create but running on the same system as well the overhead in my software package written in JAVA when including all the libraries and making all the queries.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions on how I can approach this task to achieve these goals Are there any general profiling solutions available that just plug into your system monitor and retrieve the system statistics this way Or just a pointer in the right direction would be more than helpful right now as I am completely stuck p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 75151 pI am trying to set up a toolbar which opens various windows according to the toolbar item the user selects. Each window has its own xib file and its own subclass of NSWindowController. I have not made any changes to the window controllers h and m files. A switch in the AppDelegate implementation file reads the selected toolbar items tag and allocs the appropriate window controller, then passes it the initWithWindowNibName message. The problem is that some of the windows work and others produce an undefined symbol error regarding their window controllers class name. I have double checked all imports and looked for typos. The only difference Ive spotted is that in the window controller implementation files that do work, the line interface WindowControllerName  recognizes WindowControllerName as a class name and colors it blue, but in the files that do not work, it remains black.

Negative 75151 pI have seen similar queries but none which fits my issue.p  pI have some code which removes some CSS rules for a button and then later writes them back in, in exactly the same place so to all intents and purposes the state of the CSS is unchanged. Originally mouseover worked and changed the button image as it should. I detect no difference in the CSS in Firebug but the mouseover no longer works and doesnt change the button image. The CSS is in exactly the same position as it was originally and there is no change to it. p  pIf in Firebug I alter anything in the CSS then the problem rectifies immediately. Even just changing 0px to 0px in a backgroundposition parameter for the normal sprite rule and nothing else everything is then as it should be. It seems as though something somewhere needs to be forcibly refreshed p  pAny suggestions would be gratefully received.p  pIf it should occur that removing and putting back CSS is rather pointless, it is in an attempt to isolate a similar niggle in a more useful scenario.p  pI have just checked out what happens when I Zap all the CSS and restore and everything works fine.p  pNot just in FFox either.p  pThanks.p  pJohn Bp
Negative 75151 pI have a problem with Entity Framework I hope someone might want to help with p  pstrongThe feature Im trying to implementstrong My application should be able to take an XMLdump from a third party application, look at the data and compare with whats in the applications database and update any entities depending on nontrivial criteria, which is based on both the XMLversion and the DBversion of an entity.p  pstrongApproachstrong Load all data into memory EF for DB and do all comparison in memory and write updates back to DB.p  pstrongBackground for approachstrong optional reading The customer Im working for has faced this type of problem a few times earlier, and has never been quite happy with the solutions they have found earlier. They have concluded with that this is the best approach. So Im not looking for alternative solutions at this point, rather to either find out how to do it this was or be confident it cant be done in a reasonable amount of time.p  pstrongMy problemstrong Loading the XML into memory was no problem, loading from the DB much more so. The heart of the problem is that the data is stored into 8 tables with connections and tha main table has nearly 500 000 rows. The result is a complicated query which returns a lot of data. Ive tried several approachesp  pstrong1strong Just loading it all in one big request from the SQL Server. Seems to work find for a while, while reading, until it uses about 1.6 GB of RAM, when I get a OutOfMemoryException  even if there is nearly 10 GB of free RAM. The Exception comes from within EF. At the time of the exception, about half the records had been read.p  pstrong2strong Use SkipTake to read it piece by piece. Requires OrderBy, so I order by the primary key of the primary table int, sequential but not autoincrement. This makes the query a lot more complicated, with 15 ORDER BY statements at the end, about 5 of which are to columns that actually are copies of the primary key Im sorting by. Dont know why there are so many copies, but theyre there... The query times out  of course.p  pstrong3strong Select all primary keys from the main table, sorted. Then take the first 1000 and create a limit pair containing the smallest and the biggest of these 1000. Repeat for all groups of 1000 until done. Now call the query several times, checking the primary key between the two numbers in each of the pairs, to load the set 1000 at a time. This turned out to be extremely slow  taking 45 sec per group of 1000, which is far from acceptable. p  pOption strong1strong seems to be closest to working, but there seems to be a memory limitation internally of EF. Might it be possible to adjust this somehow p  pIm at the point where Im thinking of abandoning EF for this task even if its being used throughout the application elsewhere, but thought Id give you the problem to chew on first  p
Negative 75151 pIf I am running ntp via ntp.conf heavily restricted, I cannot use a pool for a server.  Why Because the call to restrict to allow access for the pool seems to be another DNS Lookup, which returns another IP value than what was used to originally call the server.  Please show me that I am wrongbeing stupid about this.p  pCrude Example portion of ntp.confp  precodeserver 0.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst restrict default ignore restrict 6 default ignore restrict 0.debian.pool.ntp.org mask 255.255.255.255 nomodify notrap noquery codepre  pThis does not work I think because DNS calls to 0.debian.pool.ntp.org return different IP addresses and thus the wrong IP address is allowed via the poorly named restrict.p

Negative 75151 pFor any website just starting out, the load initially is minimal amp grows with a  slow pace initially. People usually start with their MySQL based sites with a single serverthat too a VPS not a dedicated server running as both app server as well as DB server amp usually get too far with this setup amp only as they feel the need they separate the DB from the app server giving it a separate VPS server. This is what a start up expects the things to be while planning about resources procurement.p  pBut so far what I have seen, its something very different with Cassandra. People usually recommend starting out with atleast a 3 node cluster, on dedicated servers with lots amp lots of RAM. 4GB or 8GB RAM is what they suggest to start with. So is it that Cassandra requires more hardware resources in comparison to MySQL,  for a website to deliver similar performance, serve similar load traffic amp same amount of data. I understand about higher storage requirements of Cassandra due to replication but what about other hardware resources  p  pCant we start off with Cassandra based apps just like MySQL. Starting with 1 or 2 VPS amp adding more whenever theres a need p  h1Edith1  pI dont want to compare apples with oranges. I just want to know how much more dangerous situation I may be in when I start out with a single node VPS based cassandra installation Vs a single node VPS based MySQL installation. Difference between these two situations. Are cassandra servers more prone to be unavailable than MySQL servers  What is bad if I put tomcat too along with Cassandra as people use LAMP stack on single server.p

Negative 75151 pI want to detect multiple faces in my project. Therefore I planned to use the trackingID property of the CIFaceFure to keep the track of the face.

Negative 75151 pI have the below code which is used to allow users to login with facebook. Currently if the user does not have the native android facebook app installed and so the webview popup login i used everything works fine, the user is logged in and the codeprocessSessionStatuscode is fired.p  pThis passes the users email on to my apps own login.p  pThe issue is when the user has the native app installed and they use that for the facebook login, the codeprocessSessionStatuscode does not fire.p  pI have set up my facebook dev settings to include the FbLoginActivity as the activity to be used by the native login. I guess I need to add something to codeonActivityResultcode to fire codeprocessSessionStatuscode once the user has logged in with the native appp  pHowever I am not sure what I need to pass to get it

service instances in the REST resource classes as well as in the JSF beans, but I cant get CDI and JAXRS work together.strongp  pThe JSFCDI part works fine, but the injection into the REST resource classes does not really work. I read some articles, where they showed two different approaches to combine CDI and JAXRS The first one is to annotate the REST resource class with codeManagedBeancode in order for the class to be instantiated by the CDI container and to be managed by the JAXRS containerp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeManagedBean Pathperson public class PersonController      Inject     private PersonService personService     ... codepre  pThe second approach is to give the class a CDI scope, e.g. codeRequestScopedcode in order for the class to be instantiated and managed by the CDI container.p  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodePathperson RequestScoped public class PersonController      Inject     private PersonService personService     ... codepre  pNone of the approaches work for me. I always end up with the following exceptionp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeorg.glassfish.hk2.api.UnsatisfiedDependencyException There was no object available for injection at InjecteerequiredTypePersonService,parentPersonController,qualifiers,position1,optionalfalse,selffalse,unqualifiednull,5643079     at org.jvnet.hk2.internal.ThreeThirtyResolver.resolveThreeThirtyResolver.java74     at org.jvnet.hk2.internal.ClazzCreator.resolveClazzCreator.java208     at org.jvnet.hk2.internal.ClazzCreator.resolveAllDependenciesClazzCreator.java231     at org.jvnet.hk2.internal.ClazzCreator.createClazzCreator.java328     at org.jvnet.hk2.internal.SystemDescriptor.createSystemDescriptor.java454     at org.glassfish.jersey.process.internal.RequestScope.findOrCreateRequestScope.java158     at org.jvnet.hk2.internal.Utilities.createServiceUtilities.java2296     at org.jvnet.hk2.internal.ServiceLocatorImpl.getServiceServiceLocatorImpl.java590     at org.jvnet.hk2.internal.ServiceLocatorImpl.getServiceServiceLocatorImpl.java577     at org.glassfish.jersey.internal.inject.Injections.getOrCreateInjections.java172 codepre  pBut this error disappears when changing the injection binding configuration top  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodebindPersonServiceImpl.class.toPersonService.class codepre  pNow injection somehow works, but for every REST request I get a new instance of the codePersonServiceImplcode injected, even if this service is application scoped. To me this is an indicator, that the JAXRS component is totally separated from the CDI stuff and lives in a completely different environment or container as the CDI  JSF stuff does.p  pSo I really wonder how to make these two concepts work together in a pure servlet 3.0 container.p

Negative 75151 pIm writing a simple window manager as a hobby project, and Ive chosen python and xlib to implement it. Id like to have some fancy effects like windows sliding from left and right, and from what Ive been able to dig up, the best way to go about this is to use the composite extension to render windows to offscreen buffers, and then manipulate those buffers and paint them however I want.p  pHowever, with pythonxlib documentation somewhat lacking, I found no way to do this, and I havent found any examples of using pythonxlib with the composite extension. Where can I find this information, and has anyone used pythonxlib with compositep  pI suppose I could always switch to xcb which seems to support composite for python, but Id prefer not having to rewrite the whole thing and figure out a different API with somewhat lacking python documentation.p  pTo summarize, my questions are p  ul liIs there a way to use composite with pythonxlib  li liWould it be a better idea to switch to xcb for thisli ul  pAny additional suggestions and advice are welcome.p

Negative 75151 pIm totally stumped by this one.

Just something with the way that MVC 4 is set up in our project. MVC 3 was added by referencing the DLLs directly from a lib folder we had created in the source control but outside of any projects. MVC 4 is added via NuGet.p  pThe issue is that System.Web.Helpers amongst others dont appear in the bin directory of the published application. This means that when it is put on the test server it wont run as the DLL is missing.p  ul liIve set Copy Local to be TRUE actually, it already was, but I turned if off and on again. I also read somewhere that if the file exists in the GAC it wont matter what this setting is, it wont copy. However, Ive checked and it isnt in the GAC.li liIve ensured that the reference in the MVC application was pointing to the version of the file in the NuGet packages folder. It wasnt originally, but Ive manually edited the csproj file to do that as removing and readding the NuGet package didnt helpli liIve added a postbuild event to copy the relevant files which doesnt affect the publish, although they are in the projects bin directoryli liIve attempted to put a codebindeployableAssembliescode folder in place, as per a hrefhttphaacked.comarchive20110525bindeployingaspnetmvc3.aspx relnofollowPhil Haacks bloga, but it seems this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12389368usingbindeployableassemblieswithvisualstudio2012doesnt work in Visual Studio 2012a.li liIve tried modifying the csproj file which is just an MSBuild file to copy the relevant files for me, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12520115msbuildtargetsandvisualstudio2012issues1257958912579589as per this SO answera.

In the struct is an int, an array of 5 doubles, and a character array of 81 elements. Of course one of the functions is to take in information from the user. That function is called setStructData p  precode    void Prog1ClasssetStructData      forint i0 ilt5 i              coutltltinput an integer, five doubles, and a character array up to 80 characters.ltltendl         cingtgtStructArray[i].miVal         forint j0 jlt5 j                      cingtgtStructArray[i].mdArray[j]                  cin.ignoren         cingtgtStructArray[i].msLine          coutltltString entered ltltStructArray[i].msLineltltendl         codepre  pThe next function getStructData is to take each element in the array of structs and cout to the user the element on one line, the next element on the next line and so on and so on until all 5 elements on the array are shown. This is what I havep  precodevoid Prog1ClassgetStructDataint index, Prog1Struct structptr      structptrampStructArray[index]     coutltltstructptrgtmiValltlt      forint i0 ilt5 i              coutltltstructptrgtmdArray[i]ltlt            coutltltstructptrgtmsLineltltendl  codepre  pThis program works when I enter by keyboard input which is inputting for each element in the structarray on one line, but my professor has given us a text file test.txt that were supposed to use and it looks like this with the character array on a different line than the restp  precode10 1.2 2.3 3.4 4.5 5.6  Test string 1 20 2.3 3.4 4.5 5.6 6.7  Test string 2 30 3.4 4.5 5.6 6.7 7.8  Test string 3 40 4.5 5.6 6.7 7.8 8.9  Test string 4 50 5.6 6.7 7.8 8.9 9.1  Test string 5 codepre  pIts the text file thats screwing my program up because it has the character array on a totally different line. I believe its just the way Im inputting the data, but I dont know how to fix it. Could anybody help me When I use IO redirection to use the test.txt file to input my data, I get it to output back the first line without the string and then the rest is a bunch of crazy junk. Please help medp

Negative 75151 pI understand the concept on Memcache but i have a doubt.p  pLets say p  pI have a table users with the three columns  userid username and password.p  pLets say the query is queryselect  from users. For the first time, the query gets executed and gets stored in the memcache as md5queryresult.p  pSo when this query gets executed next time, the md5 hash of query is executed. It matches and results are fetched from memcache.p  pBUT what if i have to just select 2 parameters from the above query.p  plike query  select username,password from users.p  pWhat do i do then I would ideally like to fetch it from the same key as select  from users since all the data needed for select username,password from users is present in the result corresponding to the key for select  from users.p  pHow do i manage such an issuep

Negative 75151 pMy company uses a software package that reads in log files from our servers, parses them, and spits performance data into a database. We dont have access  permission to modify the source code for the app that reads the files but we do have access to the code that writes the files. I need to change the way the log files are being written and I would like to use log4j so I can use an AsyncAppender. The program expects a few thingsp  p1. There should be 10 log files that roll and each log file will be one day of logs. The files need to be named 0 through 9 and I need to be able to programatically set the file name and when they roll based on the server time.p  p2. Essentially when generating the 11th log file it should delete the oldest one and start writing to that one.p  p3. When a new log file is generated I need to be able to insert a timestamp as the first line of the file System.currentTimeMillis.p  pIs it possible to meet the above requirements with a custom log4j file appender Ive looked at DailyRollingFileAppender but cant seem to figure out how to control the file names exactly like I need to. Also I cant seem to figure out how to write the first line in the log when it is generated for example is there some callback function I can register when a new log file gets rolled inp

Negative 75151 pFirst of all, I dont know if thats the correct name for the question. I just couldnt find a better one that is not too long. I am writing an RPG game in Java and I just started to code a random level generator. My idea is to create some enumerated types lets call them DungeonStyle which contain all the information required for the generator to create the level. This information includes, as an example, the density of rooms and corridors. Another information I want to store in this enumerated type is which creatures can be spawned by a Spawner Tile inside such a level. I also have to say that the way I implemented creatures was by making a class for each specific creature which inherits from the Creature class. Now I will explain the problem which is applicable for any kind nonstatic objects, not only creatures.p  pThe only way I could find to do this separation of possible creatures by DungeonStyle is inside the SpawnerTile code. I would pass a DungeonStyle as an argument to the SpawnerTiles constructor and would make distinctions inside the spawn method. Something like thisp  precodeif style  StyleA    level.addnew CreatureA   if style  StyleB    level.addnew CreatureB  codepre  pThat would work fine, but obviously not as I wanted. The creature information is not eminsideem the DungeonStyle. Its being created outside of it. I just cant find a way to store possible emclassesem of Creatures inside the DungeonStyle to make instances of them. I think my question is somewhat related to the lt when we create an ArrayListlt someobject. p

[emProfessional Cem, 2supndsup ed.]supsup states a compilable program cant have a class that directly inherits both its immediate parent and said parents parent class. Is it truep  pGiven a codeGrandParentcode and codeParentcode, which extends codeGrandParentcode, VC12 and g allows a codeGrandChildcode to directly inherit from both codeParentcode and codeGrandParentcode. In VC12 and g, its possible to define these classes as followsp  pcodeGrandParentcode declares an codeint numcode data member. codeParentcode declares its own codenumcode in addition to inheriting codeGrandParentcodes codenumcode. codeGrandChildcode declares its own codenumcode in addition to inheriting codeParentcodes and codeGrandParentcodes codenumcodes.p  pVC12 seems to allow unambiguous member access across the board, but g only allows it for some cases.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt using stdcout using stdendl  struct GrandParent  int num  struct Parent  GrandParent  int num  struct GrandChild  GrandParent, Parent  int num   int main      GrandChild gc     gc.num  2     gc.Parentnum  1     gc.ParentGrandParentnum  0  g error GrandParent is an ambiguous base of GrandChild     gc.GrandParentnum  5          g error GrandParent is an ambiguous base of GrandChild                                                    VC12 output g output     cout ltlt gc.num ltlt endl                       2  2     cout ltlt gc.Parentnum ltlt endl               1  1     cout ltlt gc.ParentGrandParentnum ltlt endl  0  NA due to above error     cout ltlt gc.GrandParentnum ltlt endl          5  NA due to above error  codepre  p2. Why is a codegc.ParentGrandParentnumcode ambiguous in g when b codegc.Parentnumcode isnt a uniquely describes its location on the inheritance tree. codegccode only has 1 codeParentcode subobject, which only has 1 codeGrandParentcode subobject, which only has 1 codenumcode. For b, codegccode has one codeParentcode, which has its own codenumcode but also a codeGrandParentcode subobject with another codenumcode.p  p3. For codegc.GrandParentnumcode, it seems VC12 looks into codegccodes immediate codeGrandParentcode base subobject for the latters codenumcode. Im guessing the reason it is unambiguous is that its a name lookup qualified by codegccode, so the entity to the right of code.code is looked for first in codegccodes scope, and the most immediate codeGrandParentcode to codegccodes scope is the directly inherited one, not the indirectly inherited one via codeParentcode. Am I wrongp  p4. Why is codegc.GrandParentnumcode ambiguous to g when  codegc.Parentnumcode isnt If one is ambiguous, then shouldnt both be equally ambiguous For the prior, codegccode has two codeGrandParentcodes and for the latter, codeParentcode has 2 codenumcodes.p  hr  psupsupGregoire, Marc R. et al. emProfessional Cem, 2supndsup ed.

Negative 75151 pIm trying to create basic password protection for a web page that doesnt have to be super secure, but I dont want to do something as simple as store the password in JS as someone with half a brain could view source.  I work with engineers, so everyone who would use this has at least half a brainp  pSomeone else suggested doing it through an AJAX call to a PHP script which stores the password.p  pIs this really any better  Cant you view the network resources, ie using Chrome, and view the PHP filep  pI tested the above using Chrome and did an inspect element and then under the Network tab there was the file titled Passwords.txt which i created...p  pI was thinking that I could store the passwords encoded only.  But id need something that only worked one way...  Ie you type in daveisawesome1234 and it encodes to something unintelligable like  OIWBOUQBPBRFBNSAION.  This way if you see the Passwords.txt file with codeOIWBOUQBPBRFBNSAIONcode in it you couldnt just type that in.  Problem with that is youd just need to read the code to figure out how I encoded it...p  pIs there a simple method that will accomplish what Im looking for  Im always learning, so please DO NOT suggest any libraries.  I want to learn to code this myself.p  pThanks in advance, Davep  pEDITp  pOk, I want to try something out.  I created a very basic page to test out 4 password encryption methods.

In the original code I have these QGraphicsSimpleTextItems MyCallout act as attachments to a QGraphicsItem that never moves, and never changes position instead it has an image that I redraw that looks like a loading bar. The text item is meant to follow and move up or down according to the percentage of that bar. If I scroll my view down so the text item is no longer visible and then scroll back up, I see artefacts. Specifically, I see that my QGraphicsLineItem used in MyCallout has an additional copy slightly abovebelow the original, and the text portion of MyCallout has disappeared. When I scroll left or right and then back is when I see these QPainter errors.

For instance using Emblem.jsp  precodeform   input typetext valuebody   button clicksubmit codepre  pThis works because youve specified the model to be edited in your route.

However, if I try something like thisp  precodeform comment   input typetext valuebody   button clicksubmit codepre  pThen Ember errors.

TextEdit.app does essentially what Im looking to achievep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgamro.png alttexteditp  pHowever, with my application, I dont get the behaviour at all, especially in relation to images embedded within the text view. For example, when I embed a large image, the image will simply be cut off if the window is too small, but when the window is resized large enough, it will render in its full size, but the text view does not constrain the content to the width of a pagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9AQdR.png alttext view small img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBEU45.jpg alttext view largep  pThis, of course, results in some strange results when printingfor example, the image is simply cut offp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comE3sX4.png altimage cut off printp  pWhen resizing the window, its immediately apparent with both centred, rightaligned or justified text that the text view isnt constraining its width to a certain number of centimetres, as indicated on the ruler.p  pHow would I go about limiting the width of the codeNSTextViewcode when printed I dont care about margins or rendering it as multiple pages in the UI although I would not mind it, but want to make sure the content of the text view is no more than the pages width when printing, according to the size set in the Page Setup panel.

Negative 75151 pIm creating a rails recipe application where when a user is creating a new recipe they have to add ingredients. I have a foods table in the database there were other attributes about foods that meant I needed another table for it. It needs to be a manytomany relationship because recipes have multiple ingredients but foods can be in multiple recipes. I created a table, recipesingredients, in order to help with this many to many relationship. The problem I am having is in the form for new recipes. The users should only be able to use foods that are in the foods table. I wanted to do the dropdown options that google does on its searches. Its the best way I could think to do this. Do any of you have ideas for how to do this Do you have other ideas for how I can add ingredients to recipesp  pIm using rails 4.1, and ruby 2.1. Im on Ubuntu 12.04.p

Negative 75151 pI am creating a new project and I have some doubts about the spring  hibernate management.

Negative 75151 pIm working on some code that has a grid view 20 child views on screen at once. Each child view draws its content in GL, and has its own drawing thread and EAGLContext.p  pThe advantage of this is that each view is relatively insulated from other GL usage in the app, though with 20 such views on screen, we have to glFlushsetCurrentContext 20 times per frame.

Negative 75151 pIm running into some trouble in my application with a LazyInitializationException. By doing some research I found out a easy solution should be using the OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter feature. Saw a lot of other people with the same problem but cant seem to make it workunderstand. Im using Spring  Hibernate  JPA.p  pI think my problem lies somewhere in the configuration to xml files. I am able to retrieve some object form the database but once I access something that needs to be fetched lazy I get the exception. I know this is happening because my object is detached from the hibernate session. But couldnt find a way to reattach it or use the OpenEntityManangerInView.p  pDo I need to do something in my controller to initiate the EntityManagerInView It does seem like the Filter itself gets

My ideas arep  ol liRegister a default tenant, which will be overwritten later in the TenantResolver. li liDetect the current tenant anywhere earlier, but where  howli liDont put the tenant configuration into the container ol liand wrap the Configuration in its own service, which locates the current tenant and returns the configuration. codetenantResolvergtgetConfigcode.li liand ...li olli ol  pIf anybody has experiences hereby, it would be very kind to give me some tipps.p  pThanksp

Negative 75151 pI installed VS2010 32b spanish, and found a strange issue while editing code. When I write s in include st... for example, this is automatically converted to a S with an accent mark.

If I write s all is ok, but if delete one , then the remaining S is again transformed in S with the accent.p  pI noticed this looks more like a visual effect, because if you copy the wrong code and paste it in another editor, it looks perfect S is just S.

Negative 75151 pI have been doing Android development for quite some time and it still manages to surprise me annoy me.p  pSince codeFragmentscode have been introduced to the API it became more and more complex to handle states through all the various callbacks from supportnonsupportthis versionthat version. Ive found them very nice to separate bits and pieces of application into separate components, I could have my UI in one class, along with logic that is dedicated for that piece of interface. But their lifecycle is tricky as hell and when you add async operations that execute callbacks whenever tasks are finished then it might take quite a lot of time to wrap your head around it and stop your application from blowing out occasionally. Then try to add instance retaining for configuration changes and you have another level of complexity. It blows my mind.p  pNow since codeFragmentscode lifecycle is entirely dependent on hosting codeActivitycode then it seems like there is no point in having any heavy lifting in codeFragmentscode. Examplep  ol licreate an codeActivitycode with a codeFragmentcodeli lipass some ID parameter to a codeFragmentcode so it can fetch some data from the network li liasynchronously execute a network request with that ID and wait for datali lidata received, update UI, good jobli ol  pThis seems like a nice piece of logic that is separated nicely and closed within a codeFragmentcode. codeFragmentcode knows what data it needs, where to get it, it knows its UI components that need to be updated when data loading is finished. When you need to display this codeFragmentcode somewhere else then you just take it and drop it somewhere else, all it needs to function properly is the ID. Just awesomep  pBut...p  pIn your async callbacks you need to create views dynamically, so you need some codeContextcode, lets call codegetActivitycode and do some creation stuff. But... then you start getting exceptions from async callbacks. codegetActivitycode is null... damn. Ok, so I will add an codeisAddedcode check and then call for codegetActivitycode if my codeFragmentcode gets detached from the codeActivitycode. Damn, still occasionally in some dreadful, very rare race condition you get a null on codegetActivitycode. Oh... my... God. And then you end up in some boiler plate logic preventing you from NPEs everywhere it is possible to happen, making async calls with codeFragmentscode a real pain in the a because you cannot rely on the framework entirely.p  pOk, lets think. Maybe I got it all wrong. If codeFragmentscode are so dependent on the hosting Activity, then do the heavy lifting stuff there, lets call for data there and we should be safe. Right Right. We are, but then we are missing the point of the codeFragmentcode being this separate bit of UI that is responsible for itself. We need to fetch data in the codeActivitycode, and when it finishes loading we need to make that data codeParcelablecode and stuff it in the arguments codeBundlecode or use some code smell setter on codeFragmentcode. Then codeActivitycode grows and it is not that nice to reuse codeFragmentscode somewhere else because you always need to copypaste the code that fetches the data to the target codeActivitycode that will reuse the codeFragmentcode.p  pOr is it that I totally miss out the whole point of codeFragmentscode and I am getting annoyed without any reason That this is my fault as I am fighting against the frameworkp  pSo... Should we ever execute asynchronous tasks in Android codeFragmentscode p
Negative 75151 pWhen we use the redirect IO operator for a shell script does the operator keep all the data to be written in memory and write it all at once or does write it to file line by line.p  pHere is what i am working on.p  pI have about 200 small files 1000 lines each in a specific format. I want to process do a regex and change the format a little each line in all the files and have the new transformed lines in a single combined file.p  pI have a transformscript.sh that takes a single file and applies the transformation. I run it in the following mannerp  precodesh transformscript.sh somefile.txt gt newfile.txt codepre  pThis works fine and fast for a single file.p  pHow do i extend to do it for all the files. will it be efficient to change transformscript.sh to take a directory as argument instead of filename and add a for loop to transform all the lines of all the files together. Or should I run the above trnsformscript.sh for each file and create a new file for each one and combine then separately.p  pThanks.p

The problem now is that if I close the application completely and click the notification of the service, the applications opens and a NullException appears, beaucse the onOptionsMenuCreate event is not called, when the application is launched through a intent from the service.

Negative 75151 pI understand that the parameter updatePeriodMillis determines how often an app widget gets updated according to the specification in the widgetproviderinfo.xml present in resxmlp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltappwidgetprovider xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidconfigurecom.example.appwidget.ConfigurationActivity     androidinitialLayoutlayoutlayoutappwidgetlarge     androidminHeight115dp     androidminWidth250dp     androidupdatePeriodMillis1800000 gtlt 30mins gt ltappwidgetprovidergt codepre  pThis approach has a drawback in that it updates the widget by waking up the phone at the designated interval if the phone is sleeping. So the issue is about battery consumption  which is a major issue if the interval is very small.p  pIf, however, you need to update more frequently andor you do not need to update while the device is asleep, then you can instead perform updates based on an alarm that will not wake the device. To do so, set an alarm with an Intent that your AppWidgetProvider receives, using the AlarmManager. Set the alarm type to either ELAPSEDREALTIME or RTC, which will only deliver the alarm when the device is awake. Then set updatePeriodMillis to zero 0. to  The code would look something like thisp  precodefinal Intent intent  new Intentcontext, UpdateService.class final PendingIntent pending  PendingIntent.getServicecontext, 0, intent, 0 final AlarmManager alarm  AlarmManager context.getSystemServiceContext.ALARMSERVICE alarm.cancelpending long interval  100060 alarm.setRepeatingAlarmManager.ELAPSEDREALTIME, SystemClock.elapsedRealtime,interval, pending codepre  pSo my question is as follows Lets say the AlarmManager is used to carry out the update. Additionally, if in the widgetproviderinfo.xml, updatePeriodMillis is strongNOTstrong set to 0, then  Which value will take the precedence The value specified as part of the Alarm or updatePeriodMillisp

Negative 75151 pAlright so I have a viewport divided into two halves, top and bottom.  The top half has combo boxes and input fields that are always visible, the bottom half has a tab panel with multiple tabs.p  pWhen I change one of the static combo boxes on the top half, Ill call it combo box codeAcode, it fires an event and in its event handler, codeAhandlercode,  it will attempt to style another combo box in one of the tabs, Ill call it combo box codeBcode, but it may do one of two things.p  pCombo box codeBcode is visible on tab code2code, not code1code.p  pSo then p  p1  If tab code1code is active, it will setup an event handler to style combo box codeBcode for when tab code2code is made active.p  p2 Otherwise, it will just immediately style it.p  pSo heres the problem  The initial combo box, codeAcode, can style combo box codeBcode one of two possible ways, depending on the selection, say coderedcode and codebluecode.p  pSo imagine the situation where tab code1code is visible, and I select the option to style codeBcode as coderedcode, then the event handler is created for when tab code2code is activated.  But then, without activating tab code2code, I change the option again in combo codeAcode, to make box codeBcode as codebluecode.p  pAt this point, I need it to remove the first event handler so that only one is fired.p  pI do not have a reference to the event handlers, but I have named them.p  pI have created functions to acquire the list of event listeners on tab code2code, and know the name of the listener to remove, so I can match names, but the scopes are not the same when I attempt to remove them with the tabs coderemoveListenercode, so nothing happens.p

Negative 75151 pWe just upgraded to Spring 4 and JMS 2.0.  We are using a codeCachingConnectionFactorycode and a codeJmsTemplatecode to publish messages and noticed that when publishing to a destination, the first attempt works and then further attempts to publish to the same destination cause the following exceptionp  blockquote   pCaused by javax.jms.IllegalStateException The producer is closedp blockquote  pEverything worked fine with Spring 3.2 and JMS 1.1 so I did some digging to see what the problem was and it seems the issue is in the codeCachedMessageProducercode class.  Normally this class reimplements all of the methods in the codeMessageProducercode interface.  Specifically there is a codeclosecode method that is reimplemented and will only reset properties but keep the producer alive since it is a caching factory after a message is sent using the codeJmsTemplatecode.p  pHowever, there is a new method in Spring 4 called codegetProxyIfNecessarycode that determines whether or not JMS 2.0 is being used and when it detects JMS 2.0 it creates a codeJms2MessageProducerInvocationHandlercode proxy.  The invoke method of this proxy is delegating all calls to the original codeMessageProducercode object, and seems to be bypassing method calls in the CachedMessageProducer.  The end result is that the close method gets called on the original codeMessageProducercode object which we dont want since it should be cached.  This means that future attempts to publish give the exception that the producer has been closed.p  pHas anyone else had this issue before  Im not sure if Im doing something wrong or if this is a bug with the new JMS 2.0 support in Spring.p

Negative 75151 pThe issue is that I want to keep the search variables that I used with a GET form when moving through the pages. Its like google does when you search for something and then you want to search for images, you just click on the images and dont need to replace the search. I did see that the link for their images or other kind of search already has the GET string in the url when the page is created. So is there a variable that contains everything from the url string and I can put it back in the href to the next page.p  pExample my current url codelocalhostindex.phpnameJohncode and I have a link to another page lets say edit.php It would be useful to put a code like echo codeedit.php.GETvar.code and this to echo to codeedit.phpnameJohncodep  pEDIT I will probably use codestring  httpbuildqueryGETcode But another thing will be the get the part with codeindex.phpcode. So if Im on this pageindex.php if the link to this page should be codeindex.phpcode and the other links to have the query argumentsp

Negative 75151 pIm trying to find a way to stop duplicate NSURLSessionDataTasks from being executed in my app. The idea Im trying to implement is that when one caller fires off an NSURLSessionDataTask request, I want any subsequent caller of the SAME request to NOT fire off the request but instead, add itself as an observerlistener to the completion of the original request so that it can also execute the completion block that gets called when the original request returns with data.p  pHere is an example code snippet that uses codeAFNetworkingcode and a subclass of codeAFHTTPSessionManagercode to fire off an codeNSURLSessionDataTaskcode.p  precodeXMLHTTPSessionManager xmlManager  [XMLHTTPSessionManager manager] NSURLSessionDataTask task  [xmlManager POSTrequest[url] parametersrequest[body] successNSURLSessionDataTask task, id responseObject       NSDictionary xmlResponseDictionary  [TBXML dictionaryWithXMLDataresponseObject errornil]       do response error checking in here and rip out boilerplate response nodes if success      blocktask, xmlResponseDictionary, nil   failureNSURLSessionDataTask task, NSError error       do error handling here and return serialized error object back to caller     blocktask, nil, error ]  [task resume] codepre  pIf one fires off the above sequence of instructions, I want any callers of duplicates to listen for the completion so they execute the same complete block.

Negative 75151 pI ran into an issue with the emclang completeem plugin in vim. The development system is Linuxi8664, but the codebase is for PowerPC32. The problem is that clang and the cross compiler disagree about the sizes of types. On PowerPC, codesizeof longcode is 4, while on i8664 it is 8.p  pThis causes a compiletimeassert to fail that checks the size of a certain struct. As a consequence, clang complete only says code User defined comletion UNPcode and does nothing else. If I remove the compiletimeassert, everything works fine.p  pIs there a way to teach clang that it is not checking native code, but cross compiled code where the sizes of types are different I.e. can I tell clang what it shall assume about the size of native types like codeintcode and codelongcode p

Since the seed guarantees that we will get the same set of random numbers each time this is expected behavior. By moving the generator outside of the function it will exist as long as the class does, and as a result continue generating numbers in that set. Is this the correct way to think about thisp

I dont know how to go about creating the loop to determine the four consecutive even integers though.

This suggests that the crash on some specific devices refers to a handful of Samsung tablets on API16 where paddingStart has its own definition and as such crashes when it tries to parse 8dp. p  pSome people in the above link have suggested to use the layoutldrtl folder to handle the rtl direction, rather than using paddingStart and paddingEnd.p  pIve also had a suggestion elsewhere to override the LayoutInflators Factory2 whenever you find that the user has a API16 tablet, and then manually set the attributes of all your views. This will certainly work, but it seems extremely manual.p  pI unfortunately dont have access to one of these devices that crash, so I cant verify why I have not found anyone online suggesting simply putting paddingStart in layoutv17 folder, and paddingLeft in layout Do the API16 Samsung tablets somehow still continue to crash despite paddingStart only being present in layoutv17p

Negative 75151 pI have a production web project running with a decent amount of data in the MySQL db. I am trying to update the database with some changes to an app called enterlink.

When I run python manage.py makemigrations enterlink the below output appearspic. My question is, why is this happening The DB already includes all the models that it lists in the picture so why is it registering those lists of models When I go to finish the migration by doing python manage.py migrate or python manage.py migrate fake enterlink pic again, I get an output shown but my database schema remains identical to the old db and any new code generates errors.

It takes the form ofp  precodeAnnotations for ltfilenamegt  codepre  pIts mucking up my stdout I played around with annotate on the command line, and I figured that these diagnostic messages were coming from stderr, because running this command directly in kshp  precodecvs annotate ltfilenamegt 1gtyay.txt 2gtboo.txt codepre  pcorrectly puts the desired annotated output into yay.txt and the diagnostics into boo.txt.

I tried this in kshp  precodeperl findbadhexowners.pl badhex.txt gt out.txt codepre  pand the diagnostic messages still printed to the console, but out.txt only contains the annotations.

Because I do not create the IE window first codeSet objIE  CreateObjectinternetexplorer.Applicationcode I do not have access to the IE window object. I let iMacros create the window with the iePrivate flag so that it will not disturb my own IE window if I should be logged in and working in the db while the script executes. However, it does try to take focus and become the active application while the script executes. Which can be very annoying at time. My goal is to be able to share these scripts with my coworkers but I dont want the IE windows popping up on them while they may be working on something else.p  pIs there a way to get to the IE object created by iMacros so that the window can be hiddenp

Negative 75151 pIm having a minor annoyance with VS 2013 when working in ASP.NET MVC Razor views.

Negative 75151 pAs per my understanding when an Object is no longer required it is best practice to unsubscribe all event handlers in any Objects that subscribes to events. p  pThis is done to avoid handling an event within an Object when the given Object may reside in a invalid state no doubt among other reasons that Im probably unaware of.p  pGiven the above, I have found myself implementing codeIDisposiblecode on all my Objects that register any form of event handlers. However, this creates the obvious complexity of having to explicitly call codeDisposecode on the given object. p  pIn the end, I find myself uncertain if this extra complexity is required or if I should simply perform the event unsubscription in the object destructor. However this obviously leaves open the possibility of unexpected behavior given that Object destruction is nondeterministic.p  pSo should all Objects that register for events be codeIDisposablecode Or is there an alternative approach that is better suitedp

Negative 75151 pThe question is pretty straightforward Is there some way to publish two different NPM modules to the npmjs registry from a single nodejs projectp  pBut for those of you wondering why the heck would someone even want to do that ... the motivation behind this question may not be too obvious. So allow me to explainp  pI use something akin to an appserver called loopback. And my nodejs app is neatly distributed into client, common and server folders.p  ol lipI often need to reuse the models in my codecommoncode folder across other projects as well. And although I can publish just that folder as a separate NPM module by using code.npmignorecode to remove the other stuff code  commonutils commonmodels.js commonmodels.json codep  pI cannot remove the clutter from my current codepackage.jsoncode, which is needed to actually run my app, from what has been published. code  npm pack  tree L 2 devw2nodemoduleswarehouse devw2nodemoduleswarehouse  README.md  common   models  nodemodules   ...   ...  package.json code As things stand, I filtered out everything other than my codecommonmodelscode folder but since Im not sure how to dynamically tweak the package.json file before packing it or as part of packing it ... an codenpm installcode will put down the dependencies that really arent required.pli lipI am not thrilled at the alternative of creating a separate project solely with models in it as that forces me to add it as a dependency to the core project and active development gets split across 2 projects where it used to be just one. codenpm linkcode etc is a good approach to get around it but it adds complexity to developer setup when onboarding new folks and making sure that nobody checks in the wrong thing.pli ol  pSo is there some way to publish two different NPM modules to the npmjs registry from a single nodejs project Or some way to use different package.json file for a separate publication but all from one projectp  hr  pUpdate What is my goalp  pTo reuse the models from my core project, across other projects, by publishing them as a NPM module.

The response itself contains no headers, so I think SimpleHTTPServer ended the headers before calling doGET.p  pIve seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma133544821024057this answera and edited my code accordinglyp  precodeclass Server      def initself         port  81         httpd  SocketServer.ThreadingTCPServer, port, self.Proxy         httpd.serveforever        class ProxySimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler          def doGETself              get handle again             self.copyfilehandle, self.wfile          def endheadersself             self.sendmyheaders             SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.endheadersself          def sendmyheadersself              Do something smart to get a filelike variable named handle             self.sendheaderAccessControlAllowOrigin,              if hasattrhandle.info, headers                 headers  handle.info.headers                 for h in headers                     self.sendheaderh[0], h[1] codepre  pBut that doesnt make any difference. The response headers are still stuffed in the file. Whats going on herep  pstrongEditstrong I updated my first example to clarify what I mean. What I want is a bit like an HTTPproxy My server should download a file from another server and just send the data back to the client. For some reasons would be too much to explain I cant use a regular proxy.p  pNow the first code example does that quite efficiently. My problem there is that all the headers get lost in the process. That means the client is unaware of the download size thus showing an indefinite progress bar or the file name Contentdisposition.p  pIn my second code example, I tried to send the headers that I got from the upstream server but the headers seem to be finished before doGET is called.p

Negative 75151 pI have inherited some code that lets the user define an ellipse on the screen for subsequent use.  Ive modified the code some code is below to allow the user to move the ellipse around the screen. I do this by simply determining if user right clicks inside ellipse.  I now need to allow the user to resize the ellipse as well and am having trouble getting started.  I have searched the internet and have not found too many examples or tutorials, but some ideas I have arep  p1 Draw a smaller and larger ellipse but invisible around original ellipse.  If mouse click is within these two ellipses, they are moving the ellipse. 2 Use math to decide if mouse click is close enough to boundary of ellipse and track mouse movement. 3 Make boundary of ellipse thick, and user has to click on boundary to resize ellipse.  Otherwise, they are outside ellipse and nothing happens, or they are inside ellipse and they are moving ellipse. 4 Use Adorners.  Not really sure about this.  Just saw a brief reference to it.p  pIm just looking for ideas on getting started on this.  Let me know if I can provide more details or code.  p  pThanks, p  pDave My abbreviated code to track right mouse down, move and up look like thisp  precode private void viewMouseRightButtonDownobject sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e               if cnv.Children  null ampamp cnv.Visibility  Visibility.Visible ampamp cnv.Children.Count gt 0 ampamp leaveSquare                      isMouseDown  true             if                  viewModel.SelectionPolygoneType  EditSelectionShape.Rectangle ampamp IsMouseInSquare sender,  e                  viewModel.SelectionPolygoneType  EditSelectionShape.Ellipse ampamp IsMouseInEllipsesender, e                                                start tracking movement                 previousMousePosition  e.GetPositionhelixViewport                 startingScrnPoint  previousMousePosition                 trackSquare  true                           else                             User click outside of shape                 trackSquare  false                                 else                       no shape on screen yet, user is going to make one              Capture the Position of the mouse click             var helix  HelixViewport3Dsender             Point position  e.GetPositionhelix             try                              HelixViewport3D selectedView  helixViewport                 Ray3D ray  null                  reinitialize the current and previous mouse positions.                 if selectedView  null                                       previousMousePosition  currentMousePosition                     currentMousePosition  position                                            catch Exception ex                              System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLineex.Message                              private void viewMouseMoveobject sender, MouseEventArgs e              if cnv.Visibility  Visibility.Visible ampamp cnv.Children  null ampamp cnv.Children.Count gt 0 ampamp leaveSquare ampamp trackSquare                       if this.isMouseDown                                                 currentScrnPoint  e.GetPositionhelixViewport                 if viewModel.SelectionPolygoneType  EditSelectionShape.Rectangle                                                     else if viewModel.SelectionPolygoneType  EditSelectionShape.Ellipse                                       Canvas.SetLeftselectionEllipse, currentScrnPoint.X  previousMousePosition.X  Canvas.GetLeftselectionEllipse                     Canvas.SetTopselectionEllipse, currentScrnPoint.Y  previousMousePosition.Y  Canvas.GetTopselectionEllipse                      setSelectionAreatrue                      previousMousePosition  currentScrnPoint                     startingScrnPoint  currentScrnPoint                                                   else if isSelectingArea  generating initial shap                      if this.isMouseDown                               currentScrnPoint  e.GetPositionhelixViewport                 if viewModel.SelectionPolygoneType  EditSelectionShape.Rectangle                                                    else if viewModel.SelectionPolygoneType  EditSelectionShape.Ellipse                                      var x  Math.MincurrentScrnPoint.X, startingScrnPoint.X                     var y  Math.MincurrentScrnPoint.Y, startingScrnPoint.Y                      selectionEllipse.Height  Math.AbscurrentScrnPoint.Y  startingScrnPoint.Y                     selectionEllipse.Width  Math.AbscurrentScrnPoint.X  startingScrnPoint.X                     Canvas.SetLeftselectionEllipse, x                     Canvas.SetTopselectionEllipse, y                     cnv.Children.Clear                     cnv.Children.AddselectionEllipse                                               private void viewMouseRightButtonUpobject sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e            ....         setSelectionArea         ....     public void setSelectionAreabool leaveSquare  false     ....     else if viewModel.SelectionPolygoneType  EditSelectionShape.Ellipse                      if viewModel.CombineAreas                 identifiedTriangles.Clear              Find the Verts and related faces in the Selection Ellipse             findVertsInsideSelectionEllipse              reset             selectionEllipsoid  new EllipsoidVisual3D             selectionBox  new TubeVisual3D             isMouseDown  false             isSelectingArea  false             perCamcb.IsEnabled  true             cnv.Visibility  Visibility.Hidden             if leaveSquare                               cnv.Visibility  Visibility.Hidden                               ...   codepre

Negative 75151 pIll try to keep the specific details of my problem out of this question and focus only on the pertinent issues.p  pLets say I have an codeAssetscode table with a primary key of codeAssetIDcode. br I have another table called codeProcessedDatescode with primary key codePIDcode and with additional columns codeAssetIDcode, codeStartDatecode, codeEndDatecode.br I want to run a process for a list of assets between a start date and end date. brBefore I can run this process, I need to know which assets and which date ranges have already been processed.p  pFor example, there are 2 entries in ProcessedDates p  precodeAssetID  StartDate  EndDate  Asset1   Day4       day7 Asset1   Day10      Day12 codepre  pI want to process Asset1 between day2 and day11. I dont need to waste time by processing on days that have already been done so in this example, I will only process asset1 from day2 to day3 and from day8 to day 9.p  pSo what I need is a query that returns the gaps in the date ranges. In this case, the result set will be 2 lines p  precodeAssetID  StartDate  EndDate  Asset1   day2       day3 Asset1   day8       day9 codepre  pIn my actual requirement I have many assetIDs. The codeProcessedDatescode table may have multiple entries for each asset or none at all and each asset does not necessarily have the same processed dates as any other asset.p  precodedeclare StartDate date, EndDate date assume these are given  get distinct assets select distinct AssetIDs from some query into Assets get the already processed date ranges select p.AssetID, p.StartDate, p.EndDate from ProcessedDates p inner join Assets a on p.AssetID  a.AssetID where p.StartDate between StartDate and EndDate or p.EndDate between StartDate and EndDate codepre  pFrom here I have no clue how to proceed. How do I get it to return codeAssetIDcode, codeStartDatecode, codeEndDatecode for all the gaps in betweenp

Negative 75151 pI know that when we create a hive table it would be saved in a HDFS location that is specified in the hivesite.xml. br So, when I create a sample strongnonpartitionedstrong hive table say SAMPLEHIVETABLE with a few columns and write data into it. My assumption is that on HDFS it would be saved under the tablename in the location specified in hivesite.xml say datacommondatabase something like strongdatacommondatabaseSAMPLEHIVETABLEstrong. br But, I see that on HDFS the data files in table is stored under a subfolder like strong0000000strong under the tablename. i.e. the data in table is saved under path datacommondatabaseSAMPLEHIVETABLEstrong0000000strong instead of just datacommondatabaseSAMPLEHIVETABLE. brbrSo, my doubt is br      Why is the data in hive table is saved under this subfolder  strong0000000strong instead of just under strongSAMPLEHIVETABLEstrongbr eventhough its not a partitioned table.p

Negative 75151 pI am trying to work on writing a div swap with images using javascript. I have created two divs. One which is display block, and the second div which is display none. When the user clicks on the image, an onclick is supposed to hide the showing div and show the hidden div in its place. p  pWhen the user clicks the same image location, the image shifts based on the xy value and the divs are supposed to swap out again. I cannot seem to get this to function correctly. I can get the click to swap out the divs when I dont set the display on either divs, but that leaves both divs showing stacked. I am almost there but cannot find what I am missing to only show one div at once. Is there a better way that I could be doing this Please helpp  precodeltdiv classrow stylemargintop 15pxgt ltdiv styleborder1px dashed CCCbackgroundfffpadding10px 0pxgt ltdiv styletextaligncentergt ltdiv idlifehacks onclicklhtrialgt ltdiv idtrialareagt ltp stylebackground urlimagesLHTrial.png 0 0backgroundrepeat norepeat height 75pxgtampnbspltpgt ltpgtltspan idlhtextgtltspan stylecolor999 fontsize12pxpadding20px 30px 0 30pxgtClick Above To OptIn To LifeHacksltspangtltspangtltpgt ltdivgt ltdiv idtrialarea2gt ltp stylebackground urlimagesLHTrial.png 0 75pxbackgroundrepeat norepeat height 75pxgtampnbspltpgt ltpgtltspan idlhtextgtltspan stylecolor999 fontsize12pxpadding20px 30px 0 30pxgtClick Above If You Want To OptOut Of LifeHacksltspangtltspangtltpgt ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pHere is my javascriptp  precodeltscriptgt  ele  document.getElementByIdtrialarea function lhtrial ifele.style.display  block      ele.style.display  none     text.innerHTML  show  else      ele.style.display  block     text.innerHTML  hide   ltscriptgt codepre
