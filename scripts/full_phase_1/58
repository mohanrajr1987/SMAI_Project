Positive 58 pI am writting an application in C that will be ran in a terminal, and it would be handy but not necesary to use some of the less used unicode characters. From my experimentation, I have not had any trouble rendering them. However, I would not use any non ascii characters if it were a likely source of trouble in the future.p  pSo, in short, can I count on just about any terminal or terminal emulator in the modern nix world mainly linux, freebsd, and osx to properly render arbitrary utf8 charactersp  pIf I cannot make such an assumption, there are particular subsets of unicode characters defined for various purposes, so would some such subset at least be reliably rendered in any likely modern nix terminal or terminal emulatorp  pNOTE When I say arbitrary, I do mean arbitrary any unicode characters. But for completeness of my question, I will note that I am primarily interested in arrows and mathematical characters, this link has lists of both a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiUnicodesymbols relnofollowhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiUnicodesymbolsa.p

I am very much Obligated to you if answer my question. p  phow can I do tcp session migration is this possible with TCPRepair  You can find some information about TCPRepair here a hrefhttpslwn.netArticles495304 relnofollowTCP connection repairap  pMy scenario is something like this I have server farm and I want to Implement Layer 7 load balancer Contentaware load balancer. For this, I need to get first 4 packet and then allocate a client request to appropriate server in my cluster according to HTTP GET header. I need to establish a TCP connection between client and SDN controller I have done this part, and I have received HTTP GET message from the client.I already have some information about the content that client need to get like content name, content length and so on. Next, I need to migrate this TCP connection to one of my servers with have this content and have better status in term of bandwidth utilization and maybe other parameters and change flow table of switch to forward the rest of the packets to this server.  Is it possible with TCPRepair I am so confused If yes and if it is possible for you, Please send me a sample code that indicate using TCPRepair. Regardsp
Positive 58 pIm trying to write a program that uses GStreamer to connect to PulseAudio as a source so that I can intercept any audio thats being played. I have no need to play it back so my assumption is that my pipeline only needs a source and demuxer, Im not sure of the latter though. The hello world example that Im working off of is a hrefhttpgstreamer.freedesktop.orgdatadocgstreamerheadmanualhtmlchapterhelloworld.html relnofollowherea, except that instead of using filesrc Im using pulsesrc.p  pIs there a good example that shows this out there already and I havent found the right combination of terms to make Google give it to me Do you have to do anything to PulseAudio to make it let you monitor its stream Should I actually be trying to instead connect to a sink to monitor whats being playedp
Positive 58 pI have Fedora 22 installed on my laptop and wrote Lubuntu 14.04 to an 8GB usb drive as well as selected to install a boot loader on the USB. The first time I tried to boot to the USB it worked and I had all my boot options for the USB and my laptop. But, when I disconnected the laptop, I was left with the grub shell. So, in trying to fix this, I manually installed a boot loader to my main partition on my laptop which got the laptop booting working without the USB stick. But, now, the USB wont give me any boot options when its connected. I have tried 3 different installs and even tried selecting to install the boot loader again on the USB and nothing is working. Is there not a way to have two boot loaders, one on the laptop and one on the usb Would me manually installing grub2 to the laptop partition have any affect on the USB booting Pleeeeease help.p
Positive 58 pI use codesocatcode for quick telnet banner grabbing, like thisp  precodefor ip in list do     socat T 1  tcpip23 amp done codepre  pIt loops through the list of specified IP addresses, and for each one calls codesocatcode which links codeTCP socketcode on port 23 with codestdincode  and disconnects after one second, while running in the background. The problem is that all of the background processes use same codestdincode, so all of them will hang. I tried codereadlinecode option, as well suppressing codestdincode with codeltdevnullcode, but with no results. codenetcatcode, for example behaves in the same way, unless codedcode is specified to ignore the input.p  pThe codesocatcode line that I specified is a part of a script that is being used for other purposes, so it would be nice if the problem could be solved without resorting to codemasscancode, codenmapcode or codenetcatcode.

Positive 58 pIn NetBSD system file usrsrcsyssysvnode.h defines structure of a vnode. However, I see that sometime while performing an operation lets say ufsgetattr a vnode is passed as a void to the called operation.p  pEach such operation has its arguments structure.

I have been thinking about how I can ensure all future child classes are serializable to XML.p  pNow, obviously I could implement the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.xml.serialization.ixmlserializable.aspxIXmlSerializablea interface and then chuck a readerwriter to it but I would like to avoid that since it then means I need to instantiate a readerwriter whenever I want to do it, and 99.99 of the time I am going to be working with a emstringem so I may just write my own.p  pHowever, to serialize to XML, I am simply decorating the class and its members with the emXmlem attributes  emXmlRootem , emXmlElementem etc. and then passing it to the emXmlSerializerem and a emStringWriterem to get the string.

Negative 58 pI have to choose a content management system to allow dynamic updating of website content.

Negative 58 pOur service tends to fall asleep during the nights on our clients server, and then have a hard time waking up. What seems to happen is that the process heap, which is sometimes several hundreds of MB, is moved to the swap file. This happens at night, when our service is not used, and others are scheduled to run DB backups, AV scans etc. When this happens, after a few hours of inactivity the first call to the service takes up to a few minutes consequent calls take seconds.p  pIm quite certain its an issue of virtual memory management, and I really hate the idea of forcing the OS to keep our service in the physical memory. I know doing that will hurt other processes on the server, and decrease the overall server throughput. Having that said, our clients just want our app to be responsive. They dont care if nightly jobs take longer.p  pI vaguely remember theres a way to force Windows to keep pages on the physical memory, but I really hate that idea. Im leaning more towards some internal or external watchdog that will initiate higherlevel functionalities there is already some internal scheduler that does very little, and makes no difference. If there were a 3rd party tool that provided that kind of service is would have been just as good.p  pId love to hear any comments, recommendations and common solutions to this kind of problem. The service is written in VC2005 and runs on Windows servers.p

Negative 58 pBackground I am writing a C program working with large amounts of geodata, and wish to load large chunks to process at a single go.

However, when nBandBytes is 466,560,000 the new throws stdbadalloc on the second try.  At this stage, the working set memory value for the process is 665,232 K  So, it I dont seem to be able to get even a gig of memory allocated.p  pThere has been some mention of a 2 gig limit for applications in 32 bit Windows which may be extended to 3 gig with the  3GB  switch for win32.  This is good advice under that environment, but not relevant to this case.p  pHow much memory should you be able to allocate under the 64 bit OS with a 32 bit applicationp

Negative 58 pI have a pretty large social network type site I have working on for about 2 years high traffic and 100s of files  I have been experimenting for the last couple years with tweaking things for max performance for the traffic and I have learned a lot.  Now I have a huge task, I am planning to completely recode my social network so I am redesigning mysql DBs and everything.  p  pBelow is a photo I made up of a couple mysql tables that I have a question about.  I currently have the login table which is used in the login process, once a user is logged into the site they very rarely need to hit the table again unless editing a email or password.  I then have a user table which is basicly the users settings and profile data for the site.  This is where I have questions, should it be better performance to split the user table into smaller tables  For example if you view the user table you will see several fields that I have marked as setting should I just create a seperate setting table  I also have fields marked with count which could be total count of comments, photos, friends, mail messages, etc. So should I create another table to store just the total count of things  p  pThe reason I have them all on 1 table now is because I was thinking maybe it would be better if I could cut down on mysql queries, instead of hitting 3 tables to get information on every page load I could hit 1.  p  pSorry if this is confusing, and thanks for any tips.  p  pimg srchttpimg2.pict.comb0576322811100800dbtable.jpg altalt textp

Negative 58 pI am looking to create a dictionary with rollback capabilities in python. The dictionary would start with a revision number of 0, and the revision would be bumped up only by explicit method call. I do not need to delete keys, only add and update key,value pairs, and then roll back. I will never need to roll forward, that is, when rolling the dictionary back, all the newer revisions can be discarded, and I can start rereving up again. thus I want behaviour likep  precodegtgtgt rr  revdictionary gtgtgt rr.rev 0 gtgtgt rr[a]  17 gtgtgt rr[b,23]  foo gtgtgt rr[a] 17 gtgtgt rr.rev 0 gtgtgt rr.rollrev gtgtgt rr.rev 1 gtgtgt rr[a] 17 gtgtgt rr[a]  0 gtgtgt rr[a] 0 gtgtgt rr[b,23] foo gtgtgt rr.rollto0 gtgtgt rr.rev 0 gtgtgt rr[a] 17 gtgtgt rr.rollto1 Exception ...  codepre  pJust to be clear, the state associated with a revision is the state of the dictionary just prior to the coderollrevcode method call. thus if I can alter the value associated with a key several times within a revision, and only have the last one remembered.p  pI would like a fairly memoryefficient implementation of this the memory usage should be proportional to the deltas. Thus emsimply having a list of copies of the dictionaryem will not scale for my problem. One should assume the keys are in the tens of thousands, and the revisions are in the hundreds of thousands.p  pWe can assume the values are immutable, but need not be numeric. For the case where the values are e.g. integers, there is a fairly straightforward implementation have a list of dictionaries of the numerical delta from revision to revision. I am not sure how to turn this into the general form. Maybe bootstrap the integer version and add on an array of values p  pall help appreciated.p

Negative 58 pI have written an application that has a number of custom views and generally draws a lot of lines and bitmaps. Since performance is somewhat critical for the application, I spent a good amount of time optimizing draw performance.p  pNow, activity monitor tells me that my application is usually using about 12 CPU and Instrument the profiler says that a whopping 10 CPU is spent in codeobjcmsgSendcode mostly in drawing related system calls.p  pOn the one hand, I am glad about this since it means that emmyem drawing is about as fast as it gets and my optimizations where a huge success. On the other hand, it seems to imply that the only thing that is still using my CPU is the ObjectiveC overhead for messages codeobjcmsgSendcode. Hence, that if I had written the application in, say, Carbon, its performance would be drastically better.p  pNow I am tempted to conclude that ObjectiveC is a language with bad performance, even though Cocoa seems to be awfully efficient since it can apparently draw faster than ObjectiveC can send messages.p  pSo, is ObjectiveC really a language with bad performance What do you think about thatp

Negative 58 pSo from my web server, I would like to use FFMPEG to transcode a media file for use with an HTML codeltaudiogtcode or codeltvideogtcode tag. Easy enough rightp  pThe conversion would need to take place in realtime, when an HTTP client requested the converted file. Ideally the file would be streamed back to the HTTP client as it is being transcoded and not afterwards at the end, since that would potentially take a while before any data starts being sent back.p  pThis would be fine, except that in todays browsers, an HTML5 audio or video tag requests the media file in multiple HTTP requests with the codeRangecode header. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1995589html5audiosafarilivebroadcastvsnotSee this question for detailsa. p  pIn that question linked above, you can see that Safari requests weird chunks of the file, including the ending few bytes. This poses a problem in that the web server WOULD have to wait for the conversion to finish, in order to deliver the final bytes of the file to conform to the codeRangecode request.p  pSo my question is, is my train of thought right Is there a better way to deliver transcoding content to an codeltaudiogtcode or codeltvideogtcode tag that wouldnt involve waiting for the entire conversion to finish Thanks in advancep

Negative 58 pI need to perform some integer divisions in the hot path of my code. Ive already determined via profiling and cycle counting that the integer divisions are costing me. Im hoping theres something I can do to strength reduce the divisions into something cheaper.p  pIn this path, I am dividing by 2n1, where n is variable. Essentially I want to optimize this function to remove the division operatorp  precodeunsigned long computeunsigned long a, unsigned int n      return a  1 ltlt n  1  codepre  pIf I were dividing by 2n, I would just replace the div with a shiftright by n. If I were dividing by a constant, I would let the compiler strength reduce that specific division, likely turning it into a multiply and some shifts. p  pIs there a similar optimization that applies to 2n1p  pEdit a here can be an arbitrary 64bit integer. n takes only a few values between 10 and, say, 25. I can certainly precompute some values for each n, but not for a.p

Negative 58 pSuppose I want to call one or more boost library functions from Ruby code. There are many examples of times where Id want to do this, but most recently I want to use the Boost Graph library for efficient graph processing.

Negative 58 pSigning with a strong name keypair stored in a .snk file is among other uses meant to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions798621doineedtopublishthepublickeyfromsnkfile799006799006protect against forging assembliesa.p  pFor example I ship my assembly signed with a strong name, then some other developer uses my assembly and so his assembly now contains a reference to mine, mentioning the public key of my keypair. Some user installs that developer assembly and my assembly and happily uses that developers code. If anyone else tries to produce an assembly that looks like a version of mine and convince the user that its an update worth installing that forged assembly wont load because I control my keypair and that forged assembly is not signed with the same keypair. Okay, cool.p  pBut what prevents a malicious party from forging both my assembly and that dependent assembly of the other developer and shipping them both They grab my assembly and that developers assembly, tamper both, sign the forged version of my assembly with whatever key, then add a reference to it into the forged version of the dependent assembly, sign it too and then ship both. I mean maliciously shipping two assemblies should not be much harder than shipping one assembly.p  pHow does signing with strong names protect against forging multiple assembliesp
Negative 58 pIn firefox, I made a web page, there are two input text elements stronginputtext1strong and stronginputtext2strong. They behave like password verification If the content of them is different, i.e. when strongonblurstrong event of stronginputtext2strong is activated, the onblurs handler will strongalertstrong something and then strongselectstrong all text of stronginputtext1strong.p  pActually, this is not easy to be implemented, as I think the events chain is not assured Maybe, inputtext1 got text selected and then lost focus by some clicking.

Not technically but artistically or user friendly. p  pOne example that I need now is a control UI to be able to select multiple nodes of a xml at 3rd level deep which will thus involve selection of nodes at two levels.p  pI used two combo boxes one after another in which content of one combo depended on another and used such combo boxes in a grid to enable multiple selection at same time. But that does look nice to team here. Say its not user friendly.p  pAny help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 58 pOur current web has been a rails application for 4 years now. It is current in version 2.3.8. Our MySQL database and data manipulation for presentation is extensive. We are about to undertake development of a companion site and are evaluating whether we should do that in rails, java, .net or php. Here are some of the factors we are considering.p  hr  pstrongRAILSstrongp  pDevelopment Environment Our machines are pcs with Windows os. We have run into Windowscentric difficulties too numerous to detail here, most of which we solved. We want to spend more time on code, less on windowsrails compatibility issues. We could switch to Linux or PearPC. Would that cut down on some of those issues, or just result in a new set Long term... we could replace our pcs with macs. p  pDevelopment Process It seems like keeping up with rails architecture is like chasing a swiftly moving target. Im sure that there are many of you out there that are perhaps a little more nimble ] but we could use a tad more stability. Anyway, the more you fall behind the most current versions the more difficult it is to find help. One advantage is that we could copy and paste some of our existing code to the new site.p  pEnd Users Attractive and easy to use application for pc or mac.p  hr  pstrongPHPstrongp  pDevelopment Environment Works well on PC with Windowsp  pDevelopment Process I dont know enough to evaluate here. One advantage is that the consultant who advises us regarding our training and education processes recommended Moodle which is written in php. A disadvantage is the need to learn php.p  pEnd Users I dont know enough to evaluate here although i have seen numerous php sites that are attractive and seem easy to use.p  hr  pstrongJAVAstrongp  pDevelopment Environment Great in pcwindowsp  pDevelopment Process A disadvantage is the need to learn java.p  pEnd Users Dont know enough yet.p  hr  pstrong.NETstrongp  pDevelopment Environment great in pcwindows ] Resource downloads were a little problematic.p  pDevelopment Process A disadvantage is the need to learn .net. We would probably go with MVC or C.p  pEnd Users obstacles for mac usersp  hr  pThank you Stackoverflow communityp  pstrongEDIT on one of our machines i did an ubuntu install. On configuring rails i ran into the same show stopper that plagued us with windows. one of our pcwindows machines is running fine for development. i have picked and picked apart that install versus the other machines and cannot find the source of the problem. i believe that rails is great... for some other team. we need a development environment that might not have all the advantages of rails, but is stable. i am not interested in language war banter... just plain, solid advice on which i can make a business decision that will lay a foundation for the next 3 to 4 years of our development initiatives. Thanksstrongp  pstrongAnother EDIT My team and i reviewed opinions expressed here and elsewhere. After the disappointment with Linux, we have come to the conclusion that it is likely that moving to Mac from PC would eliminate the windows bugaboos and free us up to keep up with the changes in rails. So... we will be purchasing our first Mac... next week. Thanks all for your help.strongp

Negative 58 pRecently Ive stumbled upon a hrefhttplambdatheultimate.orgnode24522920285BGIT20repo5D28httpgit.annexia.orgpjonesforth.gitasummary relnofollowJONESFORTHa, which is an interpreter for the Forth programming language implemented in plain assembly language.p  pI find this implementation interesting, because it shows how a language can be implemented in assembly language, although I understand that implementing a language can be a serious portability tradeoff.p  pSo I wondered if there are any other programming languages implemented in assembly language, whose source are still available and maybe are even still under active developmentp

Negative 58 p...and this broken state persisting until a device restart, since a naive attempt to restart an app would not work. Many users are not savvy enough to know how to terminate servicesbackgrounded apps. If the user cant or doesnt need to close apps, then what about restarting apps which have gone wrong  It can happen   If my app goes wrong on someones phone and they cannot easily restart the app without restarting the phone, that seems like a problem. I am aware that apps and services can be terminated by navigating system menus or double tapping the home button etc. but  many users are not aware of these features. For this reason I am thinking of adding an explicit close button to my app which will kill everything to the best of my ability, such that on a subsequent launch the program runs from the beginning again. I realise this is not the recommended approach. Thoughtsp

Better to just read the column from the DB and call the .Length property of System.Data.Linq.Binary.p  pORp  pB. Better to determine the file size of the object before it is added to the DB and create another column called Size.p  pThe files Im dealing with are generally between 0 and 3 MB with a skew towards the smaller size.

Negative 58 pWere migrating our databases to an offsite data center that contains newer more robust servers. I have a process that imports data from my application to our local sql server and it works great. However, Ive moved my database to the new server and I am strongperiodicallystrong receiving RPC timeout errors or cannot errors that state it cant make an RPC call.p  pThe old sql server really only contained my database and a couple of other custom application databases. That said, the new server is hosting other databases as well as our Sharepoint database and Team Foundation Server database. While looking at the SQL Profiler, I notice many frequent RPC calls from a TFSService even though no one is using TFS at the time. Similarly, Sharepoint is constantly connecting through RPC as well, but unlike TFS, people are actively using it. p  pTo me, those databases should be either by themselves or together on their own sql server. Am I wrong Do you think the RPC calls from TFS and Sharepoint could be hogging my connection If thats the case and if Im not permitted to move the database and the another sql server, is there a way to configure TFS and Sharepoint to tone down the amount of needless interactions to the database Any other ideas I should look forp  pBy the way, Ive received this error from my machine as well as a from a virtual machine that exists in the data center so I dont think its a connection distance issue.p  pThank You.p

Negative 58 pI have gone thru few hadoop info books and papers.p  pA Slot is a mapreduce computation unit at a node. it may be map or reduce slot. As far as, i know split is a group of blocks of files in HDFS which have some length and location of nodes where they ares stored. Mapper is class but when the code is instantiated it is called map task. Am i right  I am not clear of difference and relationship between map tasks, data splits and Mapper.p  pRegarding scheduling i understand that when a map slot of a node is free a map task is choosen from the nonrunning map task and launched if the data to be processed by the map task is the node. Can anyone explain it clearly in terms of above concepts slots, mapper and map task etc.p  pThanks, Arunp
Negative 58 pIm using XCode 4.2 on Mac OS X 10.6.8 and running the iOS5 emulator. I have a workspace with a main project, and a secondary project that the main is dependent on.p  pMy problem is, after I make change to a .cpp or .mm file in the secondary project, even though XCode recompiles the appropriate files, it does not generate new assembly code reflecting the code change.  Thus when stepping over my code in the debugger, stepping to the next line skips any changes I have made.br My only recourse is do a clean and a build.  p  pThe main project can be compiled with either LLVM GCC 4.2 or Apple LLVM Compiler 3.0. However, due to what I think are unreasonable compile errors regarding templated classes calling functions of parent classes I can only compile the secondary project with LLVM GCC 4.2.p  pBoth projects contain objective c files, though the secondary project is largely an existing c codebase being reused on iOS.p  pThanks in advance for any guidance to resolving this.p  hr  pemExample behavioremp  pstrongregular buildstrong  During debugging, imagine stepping over 3 lines of code.  The 1st line is old code that has been compiled many times.  The 2nd and 3rd lines were just typed and compiled wo doing a clean  build.  When the program counter is at the 1st line of code, the compiler thinks that all 3 lines of code are really one and is highlighting them all together to indicate the currently executing line. Stepping to the next line skips lines 2 and 3 and moves the program counter to the next valid line of code, i.e. line 4.p  pstrongclean  buildstrong This time the debugger behaves as expected.  When the program counter is at line 1, only it is highlighted.  Stepping to the next line moves the program counter to line 2.p  hr  pSince I can edit the main projects source and debug fine, perhaps my problem is that I have not properly specified the dependency between the two projects. In the main projects TargetBuild PhasesTarget Dependencies, Ive set a dependency to be the output of the subproject. Also in Xcodes project navigator view via command 1 shortcut, you can see that the subproject is physically contained inside the main project.p

Negative 58 pI am creating an app that is fully concentrated on images. If I keep on adding the images the size of the application increases. I dont know what would be the exact size of the app but I think it might increase than 20 MB. I dont want such file size of the APK, because it is a simple and information based read only app. p  pSo I have come up with an idea such that during the installation an SQLite DB would be created and in that the images would be stored from the drawable folder. That means the images would be transferred from the drawable to the SQLiteDB. The images in drawable folder will be deleted. This would make the app size smaller. Is this solution feasible p

The protocol I am works like this Every packet that machine A sends, machine B must acknowledge the same in a certain time. So a timer has to be there for every packet that machine A sends. If the timer senses timeout the socket connection must close.  This way I need to maintain timers for each and every packet. The time for timeout is same for all the packets. I am looking to know if there is any provision in C to set different timers and distinguish among them to achieve the functionality above.p

Negative 58 pI am fairly new to Android development as well as Java and i am looking to create an app activity that behaves much like google sky map.  I want to essentially have a custom camera view, which i have already set up and have working and am then thinking i want to put a transparent surfaceview on top of that camera view which i can draw 2D image files to.  Using the SENSORORIENTATION I will want that transparent surfaceView overlay to move around.  I am assuming that I will want to use a GLsurfaceview for this assuming that i will be able to draw the images to that view and just change the GLcamera view point on the sensor change.  p  pNot knowing much about GL for android I am asking if this is the right approach before i burry myself in Android OpenGL.  In that i noticed on the developer.android resources that there are two types of OpenGL for android ES 1 and ES 2.  Is one better than the other for thisp  pErikp

The number of elements returned by codeGetInstancecode can vary.p  pI found a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa73085728vvs.8029.aspxnetremotewcftopic6 relnofollowthis articlea, which sounds like what I want.  Kind of.  But it doesnt tell me how to do this in code just in the configuration.  It also doesnt quite describe what I want.  The entry point for the service delivers a proxy but I want the entry point for my service to deliver a list of proxies.p

Negative 58 pI have wrote myself a very strong protection class BlockIp that can use a blacklist with ips and can detect strange IP configurations and can block proxies. When it found one, i get a detailed email about the visitor and why it is blocked and what they want to try to do once a day of course. It seems that it is working very well because i received some real attacks in the past that have been blocked by this class. It does not block legal bots, but that is not easy to test that the detection method is correct. p  pToday i get an email from the class that it has blocked ycar10.mobile.bf1.yahoo.com, it identifies itself as a yahoo robot but was behind a proxy.

Negative 58 pMy problem is as followsp  pI have customer server control inheriting CompositeControl and INamingContainer.p  pI have a series of buttons that make up a toolbar and rendered in the CreateChildControls method.p  pI am at a stage in my project now where I have an image loaded to a page and I want to manipulate it using the toolbar, e.g. rotate, zoom. So I have buttons for rotate and zoom created as childcontrols, which may or may not be correct. The Image is currently a static Image loaded from IIS.p  pIdeally I would like to use Ajax for the existing buttons and use a jquery plugin of some sort for the image manipulation. I have scoured Google, but everything that I find is pretty vague in terms of how to registering the scripts and actually using them in the control itself.p  pSo if anyone knows how to implement either ajax enabled buttons in a composite control , or using a JQuery plugin within the composite control for the manipulation of images, that would be great. This is a purely code behind project, I cannot have any client side code, must be contained within a single DLL.p  pNot sure this requires code for answer.p

Negative 58 pIve got a class that I want to extend functionality to in a decoratoradapter kind of a way, only I dont want my extending class to have to know anything about the kinds of classes it is extending, and I dont want to have to write a new class for each type of object I want to extend.  All objects I would want to extend off of, though, share a common base class, codeTeamcode.  This sounds ripe for a use of generics, so here was my initial ideap  precodepublic class TournamentTeamltTgt  T    where T  Team     private int mSeed     public TournamentTeamT team, int seed        baseteam                    error checking stuff here                 set class variables       this.mSeed  seed         public int Seed           get  return this.mSeed       codepre  pThis would have done what I wanted, as now if I want to access members of T, the new class has all of them.  The base constructor would take care of setting up the state in a way such that the extended class didnt need to worry about it.  I also wouldnt have to know what methods to override in order to point to an internal object in a decoratorfacade type manner.  Needless to say, this didnt compile.  So, I tried something a little different.p  precode    public class TournamentTeamltTgt  Team         where T  Team              region class variables         private int mSeed         private T mTeam         endregion          public TournamentTeamint seed, T team              baseteam                                     error checking stuff here                             set class variables             this.mSeed  seed             this.mTeam  team                   public int Seed                      get  return this.mSeed                    public T Team                      get  return this.mTeam                codepre  pOK, now if I want to get at the functionality of the base class, I just call the Team property and Im good to go.  And, since its generic, I dont have to do any boxing to get to the functionality.  it works, it aint pretty, but it works.p  pWhat pattern is this, if one exists, and what pitfalls do yall see with this idea  Is there a better way to accomplish thisp

Negative 58 pI tried to stuff the question with keywords in case someone else has this issue  I couldnt find much help.p  pI have a custom View in Android that contains an LED bargraph that displays levels received via socket communication. Its basically just a clipped image. The higher the level, the less clipped the image is.p  pWhen I update the level and then invalidate the View, some devices seem to collect multiple updates and render them in chunks. The screen visibly hesitates for say 110th of a second, then rapidly paints multiple frames, and then hesitates again. It looks like its overwhelmed and dropping frames.p  pHowever, when changing another UI control on the screen, the LED bargraph paints much more frequently and smoothly. Im thinking Android is trying to help me by collecting multiple invalidations and then doing them all at once. Perhaps by manipulating controls, Im increasing my frame rate simply by giving it more to do so it delays less between actual paints.p  pUnlike animation with smooth transitions I want to show the absolute latest value as quickly as possible. My data samples arent faster than 1020fps anyway.p  pIs there an easy way to force a paint at certain points, or is this a limit of how Views work Should I be implementing this in a SurfaceView instead I have not played with that yet... want advice first. Thanks in advance for suggestions.p  pemLater that same day...emp  pUpdate I found a page in the Docs that does suggest implementing my widget as a SurfaceView is the way to gop  pa hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsgraphics2dgraphics.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsgraphics2dgraphics.htmlap  pemAn hour after that...emp  pSurfaceView seems overkill for what I want to do. The bestpractice method is to own the whole canvas, but I have already developed the rest of my controls and layouts and they work well. It must be possible to get emsomeem better performance with what I have, especially since interacting with the UI makes the redraw speed satisfactory.p

Negative 58 pbThe Problembbr I created a multi step form, and yes the javascript and all is already functional but i have this one problem. also the user has 2 options of navigating trough the form, either using the next button or directly clicking the steps at the header. lets say the user has a form with 3 groups, ergo he has 3 steps. In my code  he cant move to step 2 when he is currently in step 1 and required fields are empty, same applies with the next button. now the problem is that if he is in step 1 and he clicks step 3 he is able to proceed to it even though there are required fields that are empty in between them. I am already at lost on how do I trap this bug.p  pbThe Format of the groupsbbr The groups are divided by table ergo 1 group is under 1 table.p  pbHow I formatted my JSbbr I formatted my JS by passing 3 values to it. the first value is the current category name, the second is the category list, the third is the next category after the current.p  pThe first value is used to check whether all the required fields are filled before moving to the next step, the array is there to hide all other categories except the third value this is done when the user clicks the next step, while the third value is used for displaying the next step.p  pbPreviewb a hrefhttpscreencast.comtQwSVFolb relnofollowhttpscreencast.comtQwSVFolbap  pbThe HTMLbbrp  precodeltligtstep1ltligt ltligtstep2ltligt ltligtstep3ltligt lttable id cat1gtlttablegt lttable id cat2gtlttablegt lttable id cat3gtlttablegt codepre  pbThe JSbbrp  precodefunction dispFields2a, b, c                      var valid2             var blanks2  Array             var emailreg2  [az09].[az09][az09].[az09].[az]2,4             var myVal2  c.findinput.required.mapfunction                                         return this.val                                        .get.join,             var myTitle2  c.findinput.required.mapfunction                                         return this.attrtitle                                        .get.join,              var errorform2  myVal2.split,                 var errortitle2  myTitle2.split,                 var errorlength2  errorform2.length                  forx0xlterrorlength2x                                      iferrorform2[x]                                                    ifmyVal2                                                                valid2  true                                                          else                                                          blanks2[x]  Required  errortitle2[x]                             valid2  false                                                                       else                                              iferrortitle2[x]  Email                                                      ifemailreg2.testStringerrorform2[x].toLowerCasefalse                                 blanks2[x]  errortitle2[x]  Should be valid email                                 valid2  false                                                                               else                                                      ifblanks2                                                                valid2  true                                                                                                              var requiredS2  blanks2.toString                 var nblank2  requiredS2.split,.joinn                  ifvalid2  true                                         alertPlease reviewnnnblank2                     document.getElementByIdc.style.display                       document.getElementByIda.style.display  none                                  else                                      var ssplit  b.split,                     var fieldlength  ssplit.length                     var limit                      fori0iltfieldlengthi                                              ifa  ssplit[i]                                                          limit  1  i                             document.getElementByIda.style.display                               document.getElementByIdtcont.style.display                               document.getElementByIdi.style.color  FF7300                             iflimit  fieldlength                                                              document.getElementByIdtbutton.style.display                                                            else                                                              document.getElementByIdtbutton.style.display  none                                                                               else                                                       document.getElementByIdssplit[i].style.display  none                             document.getElementByIdssplit[i].style.color                               document.getElementByIdi.style.color                                                                             ifa  default                                                                  document.getElementByIdcaptchas.style.display                                                                         else                                                              document.getElementByIdcaptchas.style.display  none                                                                               codepre  pThank you.p

Negative 58 pIm trying to write a script in Ruby to parse a Wikipedia article using Nokogiri and CSS selectors. Im a little confused about conditionals within the script though. Heres what I have so far codepagecode is the downloaded html using Nokogirip  precodepage.cssh3.each do node   puts node.text end  page.cssli.each do node      if dD.matchnode     puts node.text.scan[d]D.first   end end  page.csstd b.each do node   puts node.text end codepre  pThis all works fine. However, what I really want is something like thisp  precodepage.cssh3, li, td b.each do node    if its an h3 node, do one thing    if its a li node, do another thing    else if its a td b node, do another thing end codepre  pThis would allow the page to be parsed in order, instead of going through the body three separate times. However, Im not sure how to write those conditionals within my script. p  pEDIT So now my script isp  precodepage.cssh3, li, td b.each do node         case node.name         when h3, b             puts node.text         when li             if dD.matchnode                 puts node.text.scan[d]D.first             end         else             next     end end codepre  pHowever, it hasnt changed the behavior. It processes them in the same order it did before all the h3 elements, then all the li elements, then all the b elements.p  pEDIT 2p  pOkay, I finally got it to work. Here was my final set of conditionalsp  precodepage.traverse do node     case             when h3  node.name              puts node.text         when li  node.name              puts node.text.scan[d]D.first if dD.matchnode         when b  node.name             puts node.text if node.parent.name  p or node.parent.name  td     end end codepre  pThanksp

Negative 58 pHaving never used a CMS system before, Im just starting evaluating .net CMS systems, with the two most attractive options seemed to be Umbraco or Orchard. p  pRe Umbraco, Id prefer to use the MVC flavoured v5, rather than spending lots of time learning XSLT for version 4.7, when that has come to the end of its development cycle. But, is now May 2012, very soon after the release of 5.1 is actually a good time to start out on the Umbraco learning curve, as there doesnt seem to be the depth of support and documentation out there for v5 compared to v4 Im sure itll be improving all the time, but as itll be my first CMS system, it seems a little scary leaping into a brand new, rapidly developing system.p  pSorry for the subjectiveness  vagueness of the question, but any useful comments comparing the probable learning curves of Orchard and Umbraco 5.1 would be very much appreciated.p

Negative 58 pAs far as all books say, switching between tasksprocesses is more expensive than switching between threads of the same processtask. If so, then scheduler of threadsaware OS should schedule threads in such way that the threads of the same processtask should be executed next to each other grouped and not interleaved with threads from other processestasks. p  pAs I am reading books on OSes, all books just stop at stating that threads switching is less expensive than process switching. And thats it. No book tells how exactly scheduler is solving problem of avoiding switching between threads of different tasks. As if such problem does not exist or is trivial to each and every reader.p  pIs my understanding of the problem not correct Or am I missing something Why such huge topic of possible performance degrade is not covered in each and every OS book in Scheduling chapter Am I reading wrong booksp

Negative 58 pIm currently getting into the codectypescode module and Im trying to call the user32 function a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms63352028vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowcodeGetWindowTextcodea with a codeHWNDcode handle I already received by using a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms63349928vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowcodeFindWindowcodea. This time though i wanted to process a step further and use a function prototype instead of calling the function with codectypes.windll.user32.GetWindowTextcode. Although Im having problems declaring the codelpStringcode arguement as output parameter.p  pMy first attempt looked this wayp  precodeGetWindowText  cfuncGetWindowTextA,windll.user32,cint,                   hWnd,HWND,1,                   lpString,LPCSTR,2,                   nMaxCount,cint,1                    codepre  pcodecfunccode is a little wrapper that I found a hrefhttpwww.cs.unc.edugbblog20070211ctypestricks relnofollowhereap  pThis prototype yields the following exception as soon as it is calledp  precode    chars,name  user32.GetWindowTexthandle,255 TypeError ccharp out parameter must be passed as default value codepre  pI thought that any output variables must be a codePOINTER...code type, so I changed my definition top  precodeGetWindowText  cfuncGetWindowTextA,windll.user32,cint,                       hWnd,HWND,1,                       lpString,POINTERcchar,2,                       nMaxCount,cint,1                        codepre  pBut this yields an exception toop  precode    chars,name  user32.GetWindowTexthandle,255 ctypes.ArgumentError argument 2 lttype exceptions.TypeErrorgt wrong type codepre  pI hope somebody knows how to call the codeGetWindowTextcode function correctly using codectypescode prototyping.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pThrough further research I could get it to work, at least somehow. The first issue I fixed was the usage of codecfunccode which had wrong calling specifiers. I defined a exact copy of that function and named it codewinfunccode and replaced codereturn CFUNCTYPEresult, atypesname, dll, tupleaflagscode with codereturn WINFUNCTYPEresult, atypesname, dll, tupleaflagscode.p  pThen I inspected prototyping further. As it seems if you pass somewhat like codesomeParameter,POINTERaType,2code to codeWINFUNCTYPEcode it will create a codeaTypecode object on call and passes a pointer to that object to the function. In the returned tuple you can then access the codeaTypecode object. This brings up another problem. A cstring is a array of chars so one needs to tell ctypes to create a codecchar arraycode. This means that something likep  precodeGetWindowText  winfuncGetWindowTextA,windll.user32,cint,                   hWnd,HWND,1,                   lpString,POINTERcchar255,2,                   nMaxCount,cint,1                    codepre  pworks just fine. But unfortunately, ctypes will now pass a pointer to a cstring which is ALWAYS 255 chars long ignoring the size specified by codenMaxCountcode.p  pIn my opinion, I think theres no way one could get that function to work with a dynamically sized cstring defined as output parameter. The only possibility seems to be simply going without the output parameter feature and defining a codeLPCSTRcode as input parameter. The callee then needs to create a buffer by his own with codectypes.createstringbuffercode and pass it to the function just as in C.p

Negative 58 pI have an issue with a game Ive been making for Android with Air. The app orients itself correctly staying in landscape up until I lock the phone Im testing with and then unlock it. When the phone unlocks, the app will then be in portrait mode it should always be in landscape.p  pIn the descriptor xml file I have set fullscreen to true, aspect ratio to landscape and auto orient to false but this doesnt seem to affect the app when being locked and unlocked it works perfectly in any other scenario. It will become portrait again and not move back to landscape when unlocked so auto orient being false definitely isnt being meddled with.p  pThis issue only triggers when youre running the game and lock the phone and unlock. If for example you were to press the home button so the app is no longer in focus, then lock and unlock and get back into the paused game it will still be in landscape.p  pEDIT Ive just made an important discovery It seems this is dependant on what kind of lock screen you use on your phone. I use an android 4 galaxy s3. I switched it to not use a lock screen and the app stayed in landscape when I unlocked This is progress. Unfortunately my friend who has a different android 4.0 phone has reported the same issue so its not just my phone.p

Negative 58 pIm using Rails 2.3.14 here, but its possible problem Im having is not confined to this particular version. This is all association and eager loading functionality that is still around in Rails 3, and has been around well before 2.3.14. Im in the process of upgrading from rails 2.3.8, where I was not having the problem described below.p  pThe code below is a mockup based on a much more complex production system. The classmodule scheme Im outlining is set up like this for a reason. Im actually including a few more details in this mockup than necessary to demonstrate the problem, hopefully make the overall structure of the system more clear.p  pSuppose I have several domain objects that can be driven, including vehicles carstrucks and golf balls. For each of these things, I have an ActiveRecord classp  precodeclass Vehicle lt ActiveRecordBase end  class Car lt Vehicle     include Driveable end  class Truck lt Vehicle     include Driveable end  class GolfBall lt ActiveRecordBase     include Driveable end codepre  pFirst note that codeGolfBallcode is a toplevel model class and the corresponding database table is codegolfballscode. On the other hand, codeCarcode and codeTruckcode are subclasses of codeVehiclecode. The database for vehicles is set up with STI, so codeCarscode and codeTruckscode both correspond to the codevehiclescode table with a codetypecode column differentiator.p  pSecondly, note that Im including a codeDrivablecode module on all the bottomlevel domain objects codeCarcode, codeTruckcode, codeGolfBallcode, and it looks like this in the actual system this module does a lot more too, including settings things up based on the specific including domain objectp  precodemodule Driven     def self.includedbase         base.classeval do             hasone driver, as gt driveable, classname gt self.nameDriver, dependent gt destroy         end     end end codepre  pSo each of these things can have a codeDrivercode, and its using a codeclassnamecode based on the including class name e.g. including class codeCarcode results in a codehasonecode with codeclassname gt CarDrivercode, because each of these referenced classes codeCarDrivercode, etc... contains specific business logic that is necessary for the associations use.p  pThere is a toplevel codeDrivercode class which sets up the polymorphic association, and then a similar subclass hierarchy as above for domain object driversp  precodeclass Driver lt ActiveRecordBase     belongsto driveable, polymorphic gt true end  class VehicleDriver lt Driver end  class CarDriver lt VehicleDriver end  class TruckDriver lt VehicleDriver end  class GolfBallDriver lt Driver end codepre  pThis is based on a single database table codedriverscode, using STI for all subclasses.p  pWith this system in place, I create a new codeCarcode stored in codecarcode below and associate it with a newlycreated codeCarDrivercode like this its split up into these particular sequential steps in this mockup to mirror the way the actual system worksp  precodecar  Car.create CarDriver.createdriveable gt car codepre  pThis created database row in the codevehiclescode table like thisp  precode id   type   ...    1    Car    ... codepre  pAnd a row in the codedriverscode table  like thisp  precode id   driveableid    driveabletype   type         ...   1    1               Vehicle          CarDriver    ... codepre  pcodeVehiclecode is the codedriveabletypecode as opposed to codeCarcode because vehicles are STI. So far so good. Now I open up a rails console and execute a simple command to get a codeCarcode instancep  precodegtgt car  Car.findlast gt ltCar id 1, type Car, ...gt codepre  pAccording to the log, here is the query that was executedp  precodeCar Load 1.0ms SELECT  FROM vehicles WHERE  vehicles.type  Car  ORDER BY vehicles.id DESC LIMIT 1 codepre  pThen I get the codeCarDrivercodep  precodegtgt car.driver gt ltCarDriver id 1, driveableid 1, driveabletype Vehicle, type CarDriver, ...gt codepre  pThis caused this query to be execute.p  precodeCarDriver Load 0.7ms SELECT  FROM drivers WHERE drivers.driveableid  1 AND drivers.driveabletype  Vehicle AND drivers.type  CarDriver  LIMIT 1 codepre  pIf I try to use eager loading, however, I get different results. From a fresh console session, I runp  precodegtgt car  Car.findlast, include gt driveable gt ltCar id 1, type Car, ...gt gtgt car.driver gt nil codepre  pThis results in codenilcode for the driver. Checking the logs, the first statement execute the following queries regular query and eager loading queryp  precodeCar Load 1.0ms SELECT  FROM vehicles WHERE  vehicles.type  Car  ORDER BY vehicles.id DESC LIMIT 1  CarDriver Load 0.8ms SELECT  FROM drivers WHERE drivers.driveableid  1 AND drivers.driveabletype  Car AND drivers.type  CarDriver  LIMIT 1 codepre  pAs you can see, in the eager loading case, the codeCarcode query is identical to the above, but the codeCarDrivercode query is different. Its mostly the same, except that for codedrivers.driveablecode type it is looking for codeCarcode where it shouldbe looking for the STI base class name, codeVehiclecode, as it does in the noneager loading case.p  pAny idea how to fix thisp

Negative 58 pI will try to describe the problem as best as I can. I have a GUI designed in C CLI Visual Studio 2010 with some OpenGL.p  pI have a loop, this is what gets done or should get done 1. Read line from a file, parse it into parts 2. Call a wait function for a certain period of time  no action to be taken during this period but GUI should be usable  emergency stop buttons, etc 3. Once time elapses, go back to reading line from file.p  pI could definitely do this on the microcontroller side in C using interrupts, but I dont know how to achieve the same thing here. My original idea was to start timer, when the event handler for elapsed time fires, call a function that would in turn call the reading function again. But I dont think that would work well, as at the end of reading the entire file, all those functions will return to their callers. This could also be a mess because file can technically have infinite number of lines run out of memory with all these calls. What I mean here is basically a huge loop of recursive functions best I can describe them, where A will call B, but B will call A, after which A calls B again.p  pI have found this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions181643waitwindowinawindowsapplicationWait window in a windows applicationa with the suggestion about using a delegate, but C doesnt accept anonymous delegates. I also dont know if this does what I want. Where will the following code snippet return to after time elapses I know this is for C, but the idea should be the same, rightp  precodeTimer t  new Timer t.Interval  2000 t.Tick  delegate  Close t.Stop t.Start codepre  pI have thought about threading, but I dont know how that will solve my problem. I need the wait timer to trigger another instance of file reading, which would involve calling a function, resulting in my endless function calls worry.p  pThere is also this, that I looked at a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.threading.timercallback.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.threading.timercallback.aspxa , which uses TimerCallback . But that would suspend the thread until timer fires, right This would mean that the GUI would be unresponsive.p  pWhile unresponsiveness is something I of course want to avoid, I could do it. Or perhaps it is better to put the whole filereadingwaiting block into its own thread and let it delay whatever it wantsp  pId appreciate the advice. p

Negative 58 pAn codeNSDatecode object represents an absolute date and time, e.g. September 4, 2012, 1000PM CDT. While this works fine when an event did indeed happen at a certain moment in time, its much more of a hassle to work with codeNSDatecode when youre dealing with something thats a recurring event. For example, Im currently working on an app that stores the hours of operation of businesses. Most businesses have a weekly schedule, which means that I would like to store the times per weekday, regardless of the date.p  pThere are several solutions create an extra entity Im working with Core Data, Hours, with attributes weekday, hour, and minute and figure it out that way. This could work for simple displaying, but Im also going to add a status such as open until x, closing in y minutes, or will open at z. This means Ill either have to create codeNSDatecode objects to do the comparing, or I take the weekday, hour, and minute properties of the current codeNSDatecode.p  pAnother option would be to store two codeNSDatecodes per business open and close, and ignore the actual date and only use the weekday, hour, and minute properties. Ive tried this, but to be able to compare dates, Id still have to manipulate codeNSDatecode objects.p  pThese are the solutions Ive come up with. Both require a lot of math and involve a bunch of ifs, buts, and maybes. It would be really easy to simply have some sort of NSTime object with which I can do everything, but that doesnt seem to exist.p  pHas anyone else had the same problems and found a better solutionp

Negative 58 pMy app only supports landscape orientations via the codesupportedInterfaceOrientationcode properties. p  pUsing an iOS prior to iOS 6, my app can successfully load an instance of codeUIImagePickerControllercode via codepresentViewControlleranimatedcompletioncode even though the codeUIImagePickerControllercode itself only supports portrait orientation. p  pThe image picker simply presented itself sideways to the user. The user rotated the phone, picked their image, and then rotated back to landscape. p  pUnder iOS 6.0, calling codepresentViewControlleranimatedcompletioncode with the codeUIImagePickerControllercode instance crashes the app. I can prevent the crash by adding portrait options to my codesupportedInterfaceOrientationcode properties. p  pHowever, operating in portrait really does not make sense for my app. I had thought I could use codeshouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientationcode to allow the app to support portrait but only be allowed to rotate to portrait in this one view. But now that method is deprecated, and I cant use the same technique with shouldAutorotate. p  pDoes anyone have any ideas how I can get around this issue under iOS 6.0p

I would like to prepare test in such a way that I would be able to replace actual call to B with my own stub  quite trivial case. However, A has only one public method calculate and I dont wish to make tests in the same package to get access to protected methods. Redesigning class A could bring more troubles than relief  it is not designed be me, there are some relations between different parts of code that make creating new classes with public methods a bit odd. p  pCould you tell me some suggestions or point to some readingsp
Negative 58 pOk let me ask this another way.  This is an example of an inciident table Im going to import in a csv format.p  precode    id     incidentdatetime 20120924 080700.0000000000     location Hamburg     reportnr 331100201     responsibleparty John     arearesident No     street 6108 FoxHunt     city Lexington     state Ky     homephone 1111111111     cellphone 2222222222     insurancecarriername Nationwide     insurancecarrierstreet Waller     insurancecarriercity Lexington     insurancecarrierstate KY     insurancecarrierphone 6666666666     insurancecarriercontact Jason     policynr 2sdf2sdf     vinnr ZTZHK3fhr5546107407     licensenr 520VDH     vehiclemake Toyota     vehiclemodel Tacoma     vehicleyear 2004     createdat      updatedat     status Recieved     userid 16     respzip 40509     insurzip 40509 codepre  pAnd here is the code for the rakefile.p  precode    require csv      namespace importincidentscsv do          task createincidents gt environment do             puts Import Incidents              csvtext  File.readcrailsthumbcostrecoverycsvlibcsvimportincidents.csv             csv  CSV.parsecsvtext, headers gt true             incidentidarray  []             csv.each do row                 row  row.tohash.withindifferentaccess                 Incident.createrow.tohash.symbolizekeys                 incidentidarray ltlt Incident.last.id             end         end     end codepre  pThe id at the top will automatically get assigned a value when it gets dumped into the database.  Im then taking that id value and saving it in an array and creating a timesheet for it.  This is what the timesheet looks like.p  precode    id     name     date     incidentid x     createdat     updatedat codepre  pThe timesheet needs to be created because a bunch of models belong to it.

Now I want to import a csv file creating safetyofficers.  Here is what the file would look like.p  precode    id      name Safety Officer 1     firsthour 1     additionalhours 2     totalhours 3     hazmathours 0.5     rate1     rate2     timesheetid     createdat     updatedat codepre  pAnd here is the code for the Importing the safetyofficer.csv file.p  precode    require csv      namespace importsafetyofficerscsv do          task createsafetyofficers gt environment do             puts Import Safety Officers              csvtext  File.readcrailsthumbcostrecoverycsvlibcsvimportsafetyofficers.csv             csv  CSV.parsecsvtext, headers gt true             csv.eachwithindex do row,index                 row  row.tohash.withindifferentaccess                 SafetyOfficer.createrow.tohash.symbolizekeys                 safetyofficer  SafetyOfficer.last                 safetyofficer.timesheetid  timesheetidarray[index]                 safetyofficer.save             end         end     end codepre  pSo above is an example of 1 incident report being imported, 1 timesheet being importedcreated and 1 safety officer being imported.  Im trying to figure out how my code needs to be modified so the safety officers know which incident report they belong to.  How do I assign them the proper timesheetid that corresponds to their incident.  I have several other models that I have to do this with as well but i just need to get it figured out for one of them and then I can duplicate it for the rest.  And all of these are saved as different rake files and are executed by one master rake task which looks like this.p  precode    require csv      namespace combinecsv do          task combine gt environment do             RakeTask[importincidentscsvcreateincidents].invoke                                                                                                                   RakeTask[importtimesheetscsvcreatetimesheets].invoke                           RakeTask[importsafetyofficerscsvcreatesafetyofficers].invoke         end     end codepre
Negative 58 pIm having a strange problem with an SQLite Database, specifically with data validation on an UPDATE query. So let me begin, if i use the following query, i get a datatype mismatch error when i try to run it. This is correct and expected because the field type is marked as an integer.p  precodeINSERT OR REPLACE INTO Table Column VALUES shouldFail codepre  pHowever, one would also expect that the following UPDATE query should return the same datatype mismatch error, but it doesnt.

Some of the instance properties getters use static properties and thus their values may change if the static property changes Heres a simplified example. p  precodeclass ExampleClass  INotifyPropertyChanged       private static int MinimumLength  5     public static int MinimumLength              get                      return MinimumLength                  set                      if MinimumLength  value                              MinimumLength  value                 WHAT GOES HERE                                 private int length  1     public int length              get                      return length gt MinimumLength  length  MinimumLength                  set                      var oldValue  length gt MinimumLength  length  MinimumLength             if length  value                              length  value                 var newValue  length gt MinimumLength  length  MinimumLength                 if newValue  oldValue                                      OnPropertyChangedlength                                                  public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged      [NotifyPropertyChangedInvocator]     protected virtual void OnPropertyChangedstring propertyName              if PropertyChanged  null                      PropertyChangedthis, new PropertyChangedEventArgspropertyName                 codepre  pClearly if the static property codeMinimumLengthcode changes then every instances property codelengthcode may also change. But how should the static property signal the possible change to the instances It cannot call codeOnPropertyChangedcode since that is not static.p  pI could keep a list at the class level of all the instances and call a method on each one, but somehow that feels like overkill. Or I could pull the static properties out into a singleton class but logically they live at the class level. Is there an established pattern for this or should I be thinking about this differentlyp

Negative 58 pSo I have been testing some new algorithms for creating a vertical scrolling game in silverlight. I came up with a very simple solution.

Negative 58 pI have some WPF GUI hosted in WinForm which has multiple codeCheckBoxescode. The default value of codeIsCheckedcode of each codeCheckBoxcode need come from different boolean fields in some background data. Each boolean field in the background data is mapped to a codeCheckBoxcode in the codeVisualTreecode. So I bind the codeIsCheckedcode property of each codeCheckBoxcode to the codeCheckBoxcode itself and use a Converter to fetch the corresponding boolean value in the background data. This way the codeCheckBoxcode becomes an input to the Converter function so that the Converter can know its location in the codeVisualTreecode and query the correct boolean field in the background data. When the user changes the codeCheckBoxcode, codeCheckedUncheckedcode eventhandlers will set the value back to the boolean field in the background data. The XAML is like thisp  precode    ltDataTemplate xKeyModuleWithEnableControlgt         ltWrapPanelgt             ltCheckBox ContentEnable                        IsCheckedBinding Path., RelativeSourceRelativeSource ModeSelf, ModeOneTime,                                    ConverterStaticResource moduleEnableDisableConverter                                                          CheckedModuleEnabled UncheckedModuleDisabled                 gt         ltWrapPanelgt     ltDataTemplategt codepre  pThe Converter code is like thisp  precodeclass ModuleEnableDisableConverter  IValueConverter      public object Convertobject value, Type targetType, object parameter, System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture            System.Windows.Controls.CheckBox theBox  System.Windows.Controls.CheckBoxvalue       Here suppose to get the default value of the CheckBox       but just return true for now       return true       codepre  pThe Checked handler code is like thisp  precode    private void ModuleEnabledobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e              MessageBoxResult result  MessageBox.ShowEnabled, Confirmation, MessageBoxButton.YesNo, MessageBoxImage.Question         if result  MessageBoxResult.Yes                    Check the sender CheckBoxs location in the VisualTree,           Do set the boolean field in the background data                  return      codepre  pWhen program starts, the Converter runs first, since it returns ture, then immediately the Checked handler codeModuleEnabledcode runs. Then the problem happens when executing the codeMessageBox.Showcode in the handler, a codePopupcode window complainsp  blockquote   pInvalidOperationException was unhandled by user codep blockquote  pandp  blockquote   pDispatcher processing has been suspendedp blockquote  pbut message are still being processed. p  pIf I comment out the codeMessageBox.Showcode line, the program executes as expected.

By best, I mean easiest to code and most maintainable, I dont mean speed, if it works in under 10 seconds its good enough. this is happening in a method that has the region name and YrQrt passed in as strings. Using those, what data structures should I use to store the table data in and how can I do it in the least amount of codep  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI have now recieved the actual excel file that I will be extracting this data from. Any advice on how to get only the yearQtr fields and the HRTC fields with C would be greatly appreciatedp  pstrongEditstrongp  pjust discovered that them machine running this application will not have excel. So the file shown above will have to be changed into another format before it is read in to the applicationthis will be handled by manually saving the file from excel as csv or xml or whatever format.

Negative 58 pIm facing a strange problem with my app. I have a LocationService that runs in the background. The way I manage its lifecycle isp  ol liIn codeonResumecode, every activity uses codebindServiceintent,serviceConnection, BINDAUTOCREATEcode like that the service is automatically created when needed.li liIn codeonStopcode, every activity uses codeunbindServiceserviceConnectioncodeli liThis works because when switching activities, the new codeActivitycode codeonResumecode is called before the old codeActivitycode codeonStopcode methodli ol  pThe problem I have is, lets say I start from the home screen and I launch the app with an Activity that has a fragment in it. The order of the function call is as followsp  ol liActivity codeonCreatecode  codesetContentViewcode is called hereli liActivity codeonResumecode  here codebindServicecode is called and should create the codeServicecodeli listrongFragment codeonResumecodestrongli liService codeonBindcode method is calledli ol  pMy question is why is there a something else between my codebindServicecodeand codeonBindcode calls I have a feeling this has something to do with threading issues.p

Negative 58 pIm using the new random number generators in  in C11. Although there are varying opinions, from this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8813592c11threadsafetyofrandomnumbergeneratorsthreada it seems that the majority believe they are not thread safe.

Negative 58 pGoing straight to the point, would it be possible to still keep a normalized, bidimensional model within the Google App Engine Datastore, where each relation is a kind in itself, and its entities are instances of the relationp  pI already know that the Datastore with its underlying Bigtable technology works differently than RDBM systems, but my question is what prevents one from emstillem laying out their model in a relational way with all its advantages from a theoretical and planning point of view within the Datastorep  pAn example to clarify. Couldnt I still plan entities of the following kindsp  ul liPerson Namestr, CompanyCompanyli liCompany Namestrli liProject Notestextli listrongPersonProjects PersonPerson, ProjectProjectstrongli ul  pThe properties which refer to other entities e.g. Person.Company, PersonProjects.Project would store those entities ids. What would the major drawbacks if any be, performancewise Note that I could have normalized the model further, e.g. introducing new kinds for PersonName, CompanyName etc, but I decided here to keep onevalue properties within the same kind they refer to.p  pI remember watching some time ago a video from the IO series made by the same Google in which normalization techniques were employed to prevent entities of a certain kind from being too large, i.e. having too many properties the problem actually involved exploding indexes. One property of the planned kind was detached from it as a new kind, only to be augmented to it afterwards through code.p  pWell, couldnt I still do that for all of a kinds properties I cant see any major issues except for the increase in clientside or serverside work that required to get an object set up for retrieval. So, is the switch to an entitybased model really necessary Cant we simulate relations through kinds and entitiesp  pI hope Ive been clear enough.p

Negative 58 pstrongEditstrong To clarify, this question concerns building GUI applications on HATEOAS APIs, how to design interfaces built on hypermedia discoverability ie. dynamic principles, and specifically dealing with avoiding purely modal GUIs that link back to home for global functionality that should be always on as represented by the hypermedia entry API point.p  hr  pIn a strict REST API implementation, utilising Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State HATEOAS, strongwhat patterns if any are used to indicaterepresent globally always valid actionsstrong if such a concept even truly exists for RESTp  pThe meta question is, can you at all factor out repeated hypermediap  pBy simplified example, lets say we have a resource codeversioncode with codeAllow OPTIONS HEAD GETcode. This resource depends on nothing and is NEVER affected by any stateful transitions that may occur elsewhere.p  ol lipIs the requirement that codeversioncode hypermedia are simply sent along with every single other resource requestpli lipOr the alternate pattern, with Client behaviour to link back to codeHomecode likely cached and THEN trigger our always valid codeversioncode call A modal pattern in GUI terms  close this resource, return home, and move onpli lipOr is there some kind of methodpattern to create independent decoupled modules for any given application perhaps namespacing of some kindpli ol  pIn a complex, but loosely coupled API, option 1 emends up being buried in Hypermedia hellem with 8095 of your payload being repeated on each resource call. Which seems right but is so nasty. Option 2 leads to either strange quirks in GUI client behaviour hiding valid elements until you return home  modal type ops OR lots of nonrestful assumptions by the GUI client hardcoding outofband actions it knows are always valid. p  pOption 3 relates back to my initial question is there a flag, or some other pattern for indicating globally valid actions that can be sent once say with the roothome resource and then factored out of subsequent responsesp

Negative 58 pI have a really odd situation with dynamic symbol binding on OS X that Im hoping to get some clues on how to resolve.p  pI have an application, written in C, which uses codedlopencode to dynamically load modules at runtime. Some of these modules export global symbols, which may be used by other modules loaded later.p  pWe have one module which Ill call codeweirdmodule.socode which exports global symbols, one of which is codeweirdmodulefunctioncode. If weirdmodule.so gets linked with a particular library which Ill call codelibsomething.dylibcode, then codeweirdmodulefunctioncode cant be bound to. But if I remove the codelsomethingcode when linking codeweirdmodule.socode, then I emcanem bind to codeweirdmodulefunctioncode.p  pWhat could possibly be going on with codelibsomething.dylibcode that would cause codeweirdmodule.socode to not export symbols Are there things I can do to debug how symbols get exported similar to how I can use codeDYLDPRINTBINDINGScode to debug how they get boundp  precode LDFLAGSbundle mmacosxversionmin10.6 Xlinker undefined Xlinker dynamiclookup usrlibbundle1.o   gcc o weirdmodule.so LDFLAGS weirdmodule.o lsomething  nm weirdmodule.so  grep weirdmodulefunction 00000000000026d0 T weirdmodulefunction   gcc o othermodule.so LDFLAGS othermodule.o lsomething  nm othermodule.so  grep weirdmodulefunction                  U weirdmodulefunction   runapp Loading weirdmodule.so Loading othermodule.so dyld lazy symbol binding failed Symbol not found weirdmodulefunction   Referenced from othermodule.so   Expected in flat namespace  dyld Symbol not found weirdmodulefunction   Referenced from othermodule.so   Expected in flat namespace   Now relink without lsomething  gcc o weirdmodule.so LDFLAGS weirdmodule.o  nm weirdmodule.so  grep weirdmodulefunction 00000000000026d0 T weirdmodulefunction  runapp Loading weirdmodule.so Loading othermodule.so  No error codepre  pemEditemp  pI tried putting together a minimal app to duplicate the problem, and in the course of doing so at least figured it out one thing we were doing wrong. There are two other pertinent facts relevant to duplicating the issue.p  pFirst is that coderunappcode preloads the module with codeRTLDLAZY  RTLDLOCALcode to inspect its metadata. The module is then codedlclosecodeed and reopened with either codeRTLDLAZY  RTLDGLOBALcode or codeRTLDNOW  RTLDLOCALcode, depending on the metadata. For both modules in question, it reopens with codeRTLDLAZY  RTLDGLOBALcode.p  pSecondly, there turns out to be a symbol collision in codeweirdmodule.socode and codelibsomething.dylibcode for a codeconstcode global.p  precode nm weirdmodule.so  grep somethingglobal 00000000000158f0 S somethingglobal   nm libsomething.dylib  grep somethingglobal 0000000000031130 S somethingglobal codepre  pIm willing to consider that the duplicate symbol would put me in the realm of undefined behavior, so Im dropping the question.p

Now this activity has its own layout which contains the Listfragment since Im using a custom list. I then need to pass the groupid to the fragment to display the proper topic based on the groupid. What I tried so far is to use a static String variable from Activity and access it on my Fragment but I think there is an issue on the Fragment Lifecycle which doesnt set the id properly. Hope someone can give me a straight to the point answer on how I can achieve this.p

Since I only have 1 reputation point as the newbie I am I cant explain myself with a screen dump, but have to at least try to explain myself in writing.p  pSo, heres my problem. Index [3] in the array events[] below begins on day four, but since day four also contain indexes [0, 1] the eventCount is set to 3. This means that if a new event occurs on day four it will be given evenCount 4. So far no problem. On day five however there are three events indexes [0, 3, 4]. Now... heres my problem. Index [3] began on day 4 on eventCount 3 and continues to day 12 whereas index [5] begin on day 5 and is given the same eventCount as index [3] simply because there are only three events that day. Heres the code snippet kudos to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers918414thinkingstiffThinkingStiffa for the basic codep  precodevar events  [ from 3, to 9 ,  from 4, to 4 ,  from 9, to 11 , from 4, to 12 , from 5, to 7 ]  for var eventIndex  0, event event  events[eventIndex], eventIndex lt events.length eventIndex   for var dayIndex  event.from dayIndex lt event.to dayIndex       var dayElement  document.getElementById day  dayIndex ,         firstDay  document.getElementsByClassName event  eventIndex ,         top     if firstDay.length           top  firstDay[0].style.top      else          var eventCount  dayElement.getElementsByClassName event .length         top   eventCount  20   px          var html  ltdiv           classevent event  eventIndex             styletop   top  gt           eventIndex          ltdivgt     dayElement.insertAdjacentHTML beforeEnd, html        codepre  pWhat I want to achieve is a check that determines if there is a continuing event from the day before that need to be added to the eventCount BEFORE adding new eventCounts so that new events dont stack in top of existing events. How do I achieve thisp  pAnd while Im at it  as it turns out, the array do not allow for additional parameters, such as for example subject. Is it possible to expand the array to contain custom parameters without breaking the entire codep  pEvery hint is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 58 pOk, this is the problem.  I have a MySQL form with a drag n drop hot spot, and several image tags.  The data field is simply a char100 that stores a link to the uploaded image file.  With each image tag I have a button to delete the image.  It in turn calls a confirm dialog, and if confirmed calls a javascript function to delete the image.  The javascript function calls a separate php file that executes the update to the MySQL table.  What I would like to do is refresh the view once all this has been executed.  I have searched all over Google, and this site and have tried numerous versions of everything claimed to work.  But so far, I have found nothing.  I dont want to use a meta tag because I found that that if you are attempting to upload an image invariably it would refresh before you can complete the upload.p  pAs it is, everything works fine, except for the timing to execute a refresh.  Im assuming and logically it would seem that once the php update function has completed that that would be the time to execute a refresh.  But so far, I havent been able to get a javascipt refresh function to work from an external php.  It also seems that from the initial javascipt function that it doesnt wait for the php to finish before calling a refresh from there.  In other words, like these last few linesp  precodeajaxRequest.openGET, AjaxDeleteImage.php  queryString, true ajaxRequest.sendnull window.location.reloadtrue codepre  pWhere you can see I commented out the reload.  I tried it there, but it just killed everything.  I would be happy to include more code if needed.  Maybe my method is too convoluted and someone can give me a swift kick if needed.p

Negative 58 pWere attempting to migrate from SignalR 1.x to SignalR 2.x and have run into some issues.p  pThe app has been using SignalR 1.x to do real time push communcations between the backend and frontend clients. In SignalR 1.x, we had access to the System.Web HttpContext sessions state. Specifically, we were using the SessionId to keep track of and manage active SignalR connections.p  pWere now attempting to upgrade to SignalR 2.x. Unfortunately, access the the System.Web HttpContext is no longer supported. This is because SignalR requests are handled before the session state module is initialized. p  pNow were tasked with coming up with some other way to uniquely track connections other than the SessionId. One thought is to grab something from the client side and pass into our initial request for subscribing to SignalR notifications. I was looking at these request cookies and wondered if there was something that I could use there.p  pAny thoughts on thisp  pThanks, JohnB p

Negative 58 ul liPlatform Linux 3.2.0 Debian Wheezyli liCompiler GCC 4.7.2 Debian 4.7.25li ul  pI am writing a function that uses ANSI escape sequences to get the current cursor position in an open terminal. Originally the function was hard coded to work on stdin and stdout. But I want the function to work on other terminals by taking a file descriptor as an argument. I just have no idea why or how some one would have the file descriptor for another terminal. I tried to use google but I do not really know how to ask my question. Anyway in my current test case I open up two gnometerminals and run tty to find one of the terminals stdin. Then I open that file up using open in an application running in the other terminal. The application then requests the current cursor position and a response is sent to the other terminals stdin. I know that their is a response because I can see part of the response echoed to the other terminal which is strange because echoing should be disabled. So my question is, why do I receive only a partial response And how would I make my function work as intendedfind the value of the current cursor position in the other terminal.p  precodeinclude ltunistd.hgt include ltfcntl.hgt include lttermios.hgt include ltstdio.hgt  int btccgetxyint term, int x, int y      struct termios attr  0     tcflagt clflag  0     cct vtime  0     cct vmin  0     int tmpy  0     int tmpx  0     int ret  0     char c  0      NOTE This function is written a bit awkwardly     because the curent terminal settings at the call of the     function must be restored weither an error has occured     or not.

Negative 58 pA staff member is telling me that creating a database and the interfaces to allow field technicians and users addedit records is impossible without a special programming environment installed on the programmers desktop machine. The field personnel would use SharePoint via their web browsers to interact with the data. Our organization has deployed SharePoint Server 2010, all users have browsers, desktops have Windows XP and MS Office.p  pI dont completely believe the staff member, but Ive been wrong before. The assertion that this developer cannot create anything useable without an upgrade to Win7, installation of a special development environment, and the like doesnt sit well with me. Ive done a fair amount of programming, and when a compiled or assembled product is the result, I too have used environments but SO much can be done these days with VBA and its ability to reach back to running SQL and SharePoint that Im having trouble agreeing that a fairly simplistic set of forms, queries and reports cant be cobbled together to do the straightforward tracking that we want to do.p  pSince Im a pointyhaired manager now and no longer coding in any respectable sense  those were the days Im hoping someone can tell me if this person is indeed correct, or if I need to call BS on this one. I certainly havent asked for anything on the bleeding edge of database development to be undertaken.p
Negative 58 pSo I need some ideas on how nicely parse a text file in C. The files that I am parsing have the following format p  precode  CommandA  list of arguments   CommandB  list of arguments   etc etc codepre  pRight now I am using an ifstream to open up the file and then I have this super long series of ifelse statements to determine what to do for each type of command. This is proving to be a bit unwieldy especially since some of the commands are for parsing other files...so I have nested ifelses with multiple ifstreams for the different files. p  pI was looking for another way of doing this but am not really sure what is the best approach. I was thinking about using a stdmap where the keys are the command strings and the values are the function pointers but I am not familiar with storing function pointers in a map especially if the different functions are of different return types, etc. p  pBelow is basically what I am currently doing. I loop through the file and use getline to get the current line. Then I use a stringstream to parse the command. Then I use a very long list of ifelses to determine which function to call. Each line in the file also comes with a list of arguments so I use the stringstream to parse those and then pass those parameters into the function I call.p  pThe problem here is twofoldp  p1 I have a very very large number of ifelses around 50p  p2 Some of the commands require me to parse new files and thus I have to open up another ifstream within the current ifstream.  see commandcp  pSo Im looking for an easiermore efficientprettier looking way to do this.p  precodeOpen file and verify validity stdifstream parseFilefilename.cstr ifparseFile.good      cerrltltERROR File is either corrupt or does not exist.ltltendl     exit1 Terminate program   Loop over file line by line stdstring line whileparseFile.eof      stdgetlineparseFile, line     stdstringstream ss     stdstring command     ss.strline     ss gtgt command      ifcommand  COMMANDA               float x,y,z          ss gtgt x gtgt y gtgt z           FunctionAx,y,z          else ifcommand  COMMANDB              float a,b,c,d,e,f         ss gtgt a gtgt b gtgt c gtgt d gtgt e gtgt f          FunctionBa,b,c,d,e,f           else ifcommand  CommandC              string nextFile         ss gtgt nextFile          ParseFilenextFile This is not recursive...this is another function          else if...            ...            etc, etc this continues on for a long time    parseFile.close codepre

I have most of my components working as they should.  I am just missing one element.  I will describe what I need and hopefully you can help get me there.  I am leaving out parts of this because it might not be reverent to the snippet and part that I need.p  pLets say I have a table of 6 rows.  Half are from AF and the other from GZ.  I have a link that when clicked shows the 3 rows that are from AF and the other link shows the other 3 from GZ.  If I click show all it shows all 5 rows.  I default by having the class matched to all rows.  When I filter by alphabet I remove the matched for all and then only add it back to my matched set.  So, when I click on AF only the ones with filtercriteria from AF will have a class of matched.p  pI have these in a container and I only want to show 2 rows at a time.  I also have a link to go up and a link to go down and traverse these rows.  The other rows outside of the 2 are in the container but set to overflowhidden.p  pIf I click my AF link and those elements match that AF I add a class called matched to those rows.  I have one visible row that is highlighted, and I call that highlighted focused row on and I add a class of on to the row.  The up and down will move this on class through my remaining results.  p  pThe problem is that if I have 5 elements that I have matched or 10 if I click on show all, I am only displaying 3 in my container.  I need to move the rows in and out of view.  I already have the other nonmatched rows set to displaynone.p  pMy Table.p  precodelttable iddatacontainergt lttheadgtltthgtNameltthgtltthgtNicknameltthgtlttrgtlttheadgt lttbodygt lttr idC1 classmatched on filtercriteriaCgtlttdgtCameronlttdgtlttdgtCamlttdgtlttrgt lttr idD1 classmatched filtercriteriaDgtlttdgtDonnielttdgtlttdgtDonlttdgtlttrgt lttr idE1 classmatched filtercriteriaEgtlttdgtEdwardlttdgtlttdgtEdlttdgtlttrgt lttr idJ2 classmatched filtercriteriaJgtlttdgtJameslttdgtlttdgtJimmylttdgtlttrgt lttr idJ3 classmatched filtercriteriaJgtlttdgtJohnnylttdgtlttdgtJohnlttdgtlttrgt lttr idT22 classmatched filtercriteriaTgtlttdgtTimothylttdgtlttdgtTimmylttdgtlttrgt lttablegt lta classUP hrefjavascriptvoid0gtupltagt lta classDOWN hrefjavascriptvoid0gtdownltagt lta hrefPICK hrefjavascriptvoid0gtpickltagt codepre  pWhat I need. 3 elements or more showing in a container that only fits 2 elements with an up and down link that moves the on class up and down.

Negative 58 pI have a C function that Id like to make available to Tcl. The thing is, Id like to make the call asynchronous from Tcl in the same fashion as threadsend, i.e. with async and varname flags. p  pI do not understand Tcls asynchronous C API, and cannot find any examples for how to use it. On the C side, I can create a thread to do the work, but then do not know how to signal when the thread is finished, and how to handle the signal to set the variable specified by the varname option passed in the Tcl command. p  pFor this problem, I am not able to use a simpler asynchronous solution from the Tcl side, such as invoking another process with a pipe, Tcl threads, or a library such as comm. The reason for this is that the C call loads in a large data structure, and there are other C calls exposed to Tcl which assume out of necessity that the memory for the structure was allocated within the same thread as the Tcl interp.p  pAny assistance at all will be much appreciated.p

Negative 58 pMy aim is to create an UIImage that scales automatically as I scroll in an UIScrollView. This works just fine but as soon as the scale of my image is set to something like .6 you arent able to scroll in the UIScrollView anymore even if you reset the scaling to 1 or 0.5 orand reassign the content size of the scrollview. This is very strange because setting the scaling to 1, .75, .5 or .25 doesnt affect the scrollview i. e. it works as it should.

Negative 58 pI am creating a text editor, and I wish to set an option of whitespace CSS property so that spaces and nbsps are preserved, but line breaks present in the HTML code do not cause a wrap.p  pThe text editor that I am creating has margins on all sides, and I would like to have the text wrap once it hits the end of a ltpgt tag. I would like to have the user be able to place as many spaces in the document without them being compressed.p  pCurrently, I have bwhitespaceprewrapb , but any line breaks in the code for the document also cause line breaks in the document. These line breaks are caused by a document converter that I have, and I would not like to modify it, unless it is absolutely necessary. Though I am not absolutely sure, I highly doubt that Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Safari all avoid placing line breaks in the code. Therefore, I see that my best option may be to set the whitespace property.p  pFrom what I have read about whitespacepreline, it sounds like the EXACT opposite of what I would like, where it collapses spaces, and breaks on code line breaksp  pI would like to have an answer that uses pure CSS, but I may be able to work with a little Javascript, but I would not like to, since this issue is not of the most EXTREME.p  pThanksp  pbEDITb Here is a JSFiddle demonstration of what currently happens a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nettXSQj relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.nettXSQja bbr br Codeb     codeltpgtA    test          paragraphltpgtcode bEnd of Codebr br b I would like to make it so that the word paragraph in the example does not skip a line do to the newline before it.p

Thus, at the end of the 5 pieces of data being sent, the entire codechatscode array ends up being filled with codeSimpleMenuItemcode of value code40code.

Negative 58 pIm needing a discussion on using a custom font with glyph of different but specific colors.p  pIn a related question I asked if I could print TrueType 3, color glyphs, using vb.net programing.p  pI was told that Windows did not support color glyphs.p  pIf this is indeed true I believe it is, is there any technology which can print a font with individually colored glyphs. Its not enough to render each glyph individually changing its fill color. The font would have individually different colored clear space around and in the glyph.p  pThis font is not an exersise in futility but a font for the visually handicapped.p  pTo reiterate the question, is there any way to render a font with individually colored glyphs. book, paper, web suggestions would also be appreciatedp

Negative 58 pI have built a Windows application for a touch screen using FPS Virtual Keyboard for WPF from FPS Components as my onscreen keyboard. This keyboard has a button for cycling through any keyboard languages installed in Windows, and everything works great throughout the application. The problem Im having appears with one aspect of the application where it can link to other locally networked panels running the same application and display some info entered from the first. If the user switches the keyboard language to, say, Arabic, the string sent to the remote panels is displayed as , I assume because the languages arent matching.p  pIs there a relatively simple way of determining what keyboard language was used to type a string, then display it properly From an application standpoint, the receiving panels dont need to actually change their local keyboard setting, so I would prefer to just be able to display the incoming string properly regardless of language, unless its a requirement of Windows that the local setting change.p  pThe panels are all running with Windows 7.p

Negative 58 pIn a breadth first search of a directed graph cycles possible, when a node is dequeued, all its children that has not yet been visited are enqueued, and the process continues until the queue its empty.p  pOne time, I implement it the other way around, where all a nodes children are enqueued, and the visitation status is checked instead when a node is dequeued.

Negative 58 pI feel a bit of a chicken and egg problem if i write a html meta tag specifying charset as say codeUTF16code  like how do we decode the entire HTTP Request in the first place if we didnt know its codeUTF16 datacode  I believe request header needs to handle this and by the time we try to read metadata like say html tag codecharsetutf16code we already know its codeUTF16code .  Besides think one level higher about header information like Request Headers  are passed in ASCII as a standard  p  pI mean at some level we need to agree upon and you cant set a data that is needed to decode as a metadata information . Can anyone clarify this  I am a bit confused on the idea of specifying a data that is needed to interpret the whole data as a metadata information inside the original data .p  pIn general how can any form of encoding work if we dont have a standard agreed upon languageencoding to convey the data about the data itself p  pFor example I am informed that Apache default has code88591code as the standard .

Negative 58 pI am trying to create a responsive photogalery. Ive solved responsive thumbnails they load the right image according to screen size and devicePixelRatio. But I also want a responsive lightbox for them. I hope there must be a suitable library...p  pThe main problem is how to load only the correct image size. For example, on my 480320 mobile phone, it is pointless to load 2Mpx images. However, on a 17 screen, it is basically what I want.p  pI hope this is simple, but I havent found a suitable lightbox library. Well, lightboxing a HTML would be a solution, but it seems to be rarely supported. The Magnifier Popup supports it, but it seems to be aimed for some different purposes and I cant make it working for photogallery.p

However I still need to pass initialization variables to the module that was once its parent. I normally assign all module instances to variables outside of the class. However, because I need to pass variables initialized in stronginitstrong to the module curves, the only way I can do it is defining it in stronginitstrong and creating an instance variable instead of a global variable. p  pIs this a standard or OK way to do this or is there a better method to accomplish this. the variable is the last line of code strongself.crvs  neocurves.Curvesself.axis, self.safemodestrongp  precodefrom pymel.core import  import neoname import neocurves  nc  neoname.Name  class Proxyobject     Contains methods to create a generic proxy chain.

I use realtime multiplayer in game and send reliable messages periodically between the users 1 message per second on average larger files are split and may be sent at 10 msgs per second. p  pThe issue I am encountering is that the messages dont seem to be reaching their destination. I send messages to the other users as soon as I am connected to the room and I see that the other user has joined. Sometimes the message will reach the target and sometimes it wont. If I set a delay of 10sec just for testing after I have entered the room, then the messages seem to always go through.p  pI checked the status codes and I get STATUSOK 0 from the message callback and positive or zero integer as the return value when sending a reliable message. So I am not getting an error, but the messages are not being sent or received.p  pIs there some condition that needs to be satisfied before you can start sending messages p  pUpdatep  pI actually have a system that lets me send data when one of the following is called onRoomConnected, onP2PConnected, and onPeersConnected.

Negative 58 pI have a MongoDB v2.4 replica set on AWS and have been monitoring my stats using a hrefhttpsmms.mongodb.com relnofollowMMSa and a hrefhttpdocs.mongodb.orgv2.4referencemethoddb.stats relnofollowdbStatsa. Yesterday I saw an increase in both mapped and virtual memory usage, which correlated with an increased data fileSize and looked completely normal...except that the increase occurred on the secondaries a full two hours embeforeem it occurred on the primary all of these members being located in the same data center.p  pI vaguely recall that not all members of a replica set will necessarily have the same organization of data in their data files, and I know that you can use the a hrefhttpdocs.mongodb.orgv2.4referencecommandcompact relnofollowcompacta command to defragment the files.p  pThe only difference between the primary and the secondaries in this replica set is that, at one time, the primary was taken offline for roughly 20 minutes. It was then brought back online and reelected as the primary.p  pMy question is Is there any reason to be alarmed that the primary seemed to lag behind the secondaries when increasing its mapped amp virtual memory usagep

Negative 58 pSituation is as follows I made a tool allowing a user to create flashcards stored in a mysqllibrary. Now if you want to print the flashcards, the script generates a table in which the tds have a fixed width in px, inside is a div containing the userentered text for the front or backside of the flashcard. Since the amount of text can vary, the standard fontsize is reduced if necessary. Looks like thatp  precodeHTML lttable classcardtablegt     lttrgt         lttd classcardtd wrapgtltdiv classadjustsizegt                    Shorter Text here in the first td             ltdivgtlttdgt         lttd classcardtd wrapgtltdiv classadjustsizegt                    Might be a loooooooooooooooong text here in the second td             ltdivgtlttdgt     lttrgt lttablegt   CSS table.cardtable      tablelayoutfixed     bordercollapsecollapse     pagebreakbeforealways   td.cardtd      width 470px     maxwidth 470px     height300px     maxheight300px     fontsize11px     paddingtop20px     paddingbottom20px     paddingleft22px     paddingright22px   td.wrap  if a word is too long gt break it      whitespace pre            CSS 2.0      whitespace prewrap       CSS 2.1      whitespace preline       CSS 3.0      whitespace prewrap      Opera 46      whitespace oprewrap    Opera 7      whitespace mozprewrap  Mozilla      whitespace hpprewrap   HP Printers      wordwrap breakword       IE 5    div.adjustsize     displayblock    maxwidthinherit    maxheightinherit    fontsize100    overflowhidden    verticalalignmiddle    textaligncenter     Js ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     function          div.adjustsize.eachfunction              var fontSize  100             while this.scrollHeight gt this.height ampamp fontSize gt 0                  fontSize  0.2                 this.cssfontsize, fontSize                              ltscriptgt codepre  pSo now my big problem is When I let the script render the table in Firefox, the JS adjusts the size of the font correctly, meaning that if a text is too long at first, the JS reduces the font size until it fits the div. But if I want to print the page afterwards, in the printmode of firefox the text suddenly exceeds the div, meaning that a part of it is not visible anymore scaling 100p  pPS I chose the width and height of the td to fit it more or less on a A4 sheet of paper.p  pEDIT Thanks for the suggestions. I tried using the media css styles and I checked every css value I could imagine with the window.onbeforeprint and window.onafterprint function to see if anything somehow changed but nothing. Every value including padding, margin, letterspacing, etc. is exactly the same as before, yet when I press print in Firefox, the preview somewhat compressesnarrows some elements causing the text to take up more lines. Strangely, when using some plugins in Firefox that allows you to edit code in print mode that plugin displays the rendered elements correctly.p  pConcluding, the problem seems somehow only to occur in print preview and the actual printing later but I cannot find a corresponding error or mismatch in the code.p  pI read a couple of articles about dpi, is it possible that the print preview uses a different dpi from my browser because it is trying to imitatepreview a printer which have a different dpi than screens  p

Negative 58 pI am reading this book PHP and MySQL Web Development by Luke Welling Laura Thomson Fourth Edition page 751 for those of you who are familiar with this book.

Negative 58 pI have a dictionary of words and I want to make a search algorithm to determine if a given string with length at least 3, maximum 10 exists in the dictionary.p  pWhat I thought to do was a tree where each level is a consecutive letter from the tested word. If I try to get a child for the next letter and there is none, then the word does not exist.p  pFor example, for the word weed, the root is w, is there a child e  Yes Does that have a child e  Yes Does THAT have a child d  No Word does not exist. Yes Word exists.p  pThe problem is the sheer size of the dictionary. It takes so much time to build that immense tree from a text file that my application freezes and it takes too many seconds around 8, depends on the pc and might trigger browsers with swf stopped responding, stop itp  pWhat I want is to prebuild the tree in AIR then save it as binary. The last step is to extract the prebuilt tree, somehow. Not using readObject because that builds the giant tree with strongnewstrong I somehow want to cast the bytearrary as Object and access that from memory, but I have no clue how to start doing this.p

The idea is to randomly add new roads to the current route until it  its destination. p  pThe code itself is done but I want to upgrade it in the following way p  pAfter the first route is calculated, it would save the time it takes to reach the destination via this route and save it. Then it goes  back and starts calculating a new route, while keeping an eye on the time.  If the new route becomes longer than the new one before reaching its destination it is ditched and the program starts calculating a new route. If on the other hand the program finds a new quicker route, it replaces the time with the new one, and continues. p  pNow the only problem is, can I define a variable that will be the same in every step of the recursion, but changeable at the very last step p  precodedef getquickestroutevianetwork, start, destination, vias, result[]      allresults  []      for roadid in network[start]          if roadid not in result              heres where I would like to check if the route didnt become too long.               result.extend[roadid]             currentroutetime  gettimeofroutenetwork, result          else             continue          for city in network[start][roadid]              if city  destination and citiesoccurinroutenetwork, vias, result                 allresults.extendresult                  here Id like to change the time of the shortest route yet              else                 solutions  getquickestroutevianetwork, city, destination, vias, result                  if lensolutions gt 0                     if lensolutions  1                          solutions  solutions[0]                      allresults.appendsolutions          result.removeroadid      return allresults codepre  pAt present the code saves all possible routes, but if I can add this one  feature, I wont have to filter them out afterwards.p

Negative 58 pI have looked online as much as I could except for the Microsoft support website, which is blocked at work for some reason. I am trying to simply skip an error. My code written here is simplified but should work the same way.p  pstrongWhat my code is supposed to dostrong One of my subs creates shapes in a loop and names them btn1, btn2, etc. But before creating them, it calls a sub that tries to delete them so as not to create duplicates. This sub loops through btn1, btn2, etc and deletes the shapes usingp  precodefor i  1 to a certain number     Set shp  foverview.Shapesbtn amp i     shp.delete next codepre  pOf course, it happens that the shape cannot be deleted because it simply does not exist. I have found that most of the time, the reccomended fix is to add on error resume next before setting the shape, as I get an error saying it does not exist. I have tried it inside the loop, before the loop, etc, like sop  precodefor i  1 to a certain number     On Error Resume Next     Set shp  foverview.Shapesbtn amp i     shp.delete next codepre  pAs far as I understand it is supposed to loop right through if the shape doesnt exist, but I still get the same error whether or not I add the On error resume next What am I doing wrongp  pEDIT There is no error when the shapes do exist.p

Negative 58 pIm looking for a way to load a bunch of embedded images into a global array of byte arrays that can be called by reference.  Or if theres a smarter way to do this, that would be great, too.p  pThe purpose is as follows  I have a handful will probably be 56 in the end of blank images that will be called, modified, and written out to files sometimes just .tif files, sometimes embedded into an .xml file.  This is a primary function of the app, and images are called a lot a typical use of the application might generate 5001000 images.  Right now Im using a single embedded image as proof of concept.  I also want the user to be able to choose which images they might use, and then each will be randomly assigned per image created.  In other words, there might be five possible base images, if the user checks two of them, every time an image is called I want it to randomly choose between the two they have selected as options.p  pThe array would allow easy random picking each time, and also keep the byte array for each loaded in memory for quicker access I believe.p  pSo, load all image resources into an array at launch, then copy the needed image form that array each time, modify it and save it out as needed.p  pThoughtsp
Negative 58 pOK, Ive come across some articles a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions472906convertingastringtobytearraywithoutusinganencodingbytebybyteherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions78181howdoyougetastringfromamemorystreamherea, but they arent doing quite what I need to do, and Im running into some trouble. p  pI am receiving an encrypted piece of data as a memorystream. I need to somehow write the memorystream to a file the way I wrote the mockup, as a string would be best, then retrieve the string from the file and send it, as a memorystream, to a service to be decrypted. I was just using a streamreader to store the memorystream as a string, and was reading the string into memory using an encoding. p  pThe problem was I got an error saying that my encrypted data was corrupted. I think this means that I changed the bytes, somehow. p  pHere is the code reading the memorystream into a stringp  precodeusing StreamReader reader  new StreamReaderdataKeyResponse.CiphertextBlob      encryptedDataKey  reader.ReadToEnd  codepre  pAnd here is the code reading the string, retrieved from the file, into a memorystreamp  precodeMemoryStream mStream  new MemoryStreamASCIIEncoding.Default.GetBytesencryptedKey codepre  pI thought the step that did it was the ASCIIEncoding, but then I implemented a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions472906convertingastringtobytearraywithoutusinganencodingbytebybytethe workaround from abovea, converted the byte array to a memorystream, and got the same error. p  precodebyte[] bytes  new byte[encryptedKey.Lengthsizeof char] System.Buffer.BlockCopyencryptedKey.ToCharArray, 0, bytes, 0, bytes.Length  string decryptedKey using MemoryStream mStream  new MemoryStream      mStream.Writebytes, 0, bytes.Length     var decryptRequest  new DecryptRequest     CiphertextBlob  mStream     var decryptResponse  client.DecryptdecryptRequest     using StreamReader reader  new StreamReaderdecryptResponse.Plaintext              decryptedKey  reader.ReadToEnd       codepre  pI am assuming 1 that there is something changing the data somehow and not some other error 2 that it is in the stream  string or string  stream transition, and not the string  file or string lt file transition and 3 that a perfect copy of the data coming in and going out will fix the problemthe data coming in is supposed to be a plaintext encrypted version maybe there is an expectation that I encode the stream coming in and going out does encoding even change the data Im judging from the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions472906convertingastringtobytearraywithoutusinganencodingbytebybyteposta that it does. p  pEither a confirmation that the bytes should be equivalent going in and going out, or a way to capture the memorystream in a file, and send it back out without changing anything would be awesome.p

If an item Im searching for such as a box contains multiple child items the contents of the box, I want to include the box, and its contents ie, all of the child items, in the results. I have no idea how to represent this relationship in terms of SQL queries or DB design.p  pFurthermore, if I have 5 of a given item say, a sound card, 1 might exist in a computer case, 2 might exist in a box inside a container in the corner, and 2 more might be in this quickgrab tray on my desk.

Negative 58 pNowadays, Im participating in few competitions in codegolf. For a particular question. Ive submitted an answer in java which contains Nested loops like this.p  precodeforint i0 i lt 200000000 i     forint j0 j lt 1000000 j         declare some variables         do operations         modify variables outside of for loop       codepre  pAssume this takes codencode time.p  pAnother member posted a similar answer but like this.p  precodeforint i0 i lt 200000000 i     nextLooppass necessary args   private void nextLoopnecessary args     forint j0 j lt 1000000 j         declare some variables         do operations         modify variables outside of for loop       codepre  pBut this takes only 60 of codencode time. then I realised it would be related to Garbase collection of the nested loops. The logic of both codes were the same, but seperating the inner loop into a method makes it more faster. I assume this is because Garbage collection is happening once the codenextLoopcode method finishes but there is a problem in Garbage collection regarding First codes nested for loops.p  pNow regarding first code, does the memory taken by inner for loop wont be automatically garbage collected once the next iteration of parent loop startsp  h2REAL CODEh2  pstrongMethod 2 Fasterstrongp  precodepublic class MinPrimeFactorSum       static int[] primes  new int[20000000]     static int count  0      static int temp     static int p     static long total  2      public static void mainString[] args           long start  System.nanoTime          int i3         for ilt10000000 i  2               Calling the inner loop as a method             temp  getDatai             if i  temp                   primes[count]  temp                 count                          total  temp  2                  System.out.println i     total   in   System.nanoTime  start1000000   milliseconds             Inner Loop as a method     private static int getDataint i          temp  i         forint index  0index lt count index               p  primes[index]             if i  p  0                   temp  p                 break                          if p gt Math.sqrti                   break                               return temp        codepre  pstrongMethod 1 Slowerstrongp  precodepublic class MinPrimeFactorSum       static int[] primes  new int[20000000]     static int count  0      static int temp     static int p     static long total  2      public static void mainString[] args           long start  System.nanoTime          int i3         for ilt10000000 i  2              temp  i               Inner Loop Starts             forint index  0index lt count index                   p  primes[index]                 if i  p  0                       temp  p                     break                                  if p gt Math.sqrti                       break                                            Inner Loop ends              if i  temp                   primes[count]  temp                 count                          total  temp  2                  System.out.println i     total   in   System.nanoTime  start1000000   milliseconds         codepre  pIve posted this question only after a series of tests.p

Negative 58 pI have two MSIL Dll Lib1.dll amp Lib2.dll with same name of class and namespace and methods but they have different names The Assembly Metadata Name is same . Im trying to build new assembly and use this assemblies using csc c compiler . So it causes me to use codeextern aliascode feature that uses like this p  precodeextern alias Lib1 extern alias Lib2 codepre  pThe problem is they Lib1 amp Lib2 have a same name on their metadatas and if I use p  precodecsc ...  rLib1Lib1.dll rLib2Lib2.dll ... codepre  pIt will build but the result is in error because all of the instance on methods point to Lib1.dll p  pAs I search on the internet I understand that it is not possible to change their metadata name . And I know it is not reasonable to use codeILASMcode amp codeILDASMcode to change their metadatas .p  pSo is there any way to point at the correct assembly on CSC or something else to solve it p  pNote  I use .Net Framework 4.0p
Negative 58 pIn our application JavaTomcatLinux, all the configuration files are assocaited with nonroot users say, dummyuser. The idea is if any one of the files needs an updatebackup, any nonroot user can perform that root access to the system is not required.

Negative 58 pI am using Spring Boot 1.2.5 and want to do some JUnit4 testing. I have an Eclipse project that contains the test. During initializiation a temporay H2 database is created. I have a schema.xml and data.xml. The initialization is fine, but later three of 5 tables are empty.p  pFirst I had the database created by Spring boot. No code from my side, just the XML in the resources folder. This runs without any problems. Then I found that in the test three of the five tables are empty. The schema still exists, but not data. p  pI then changed to manual creation of the H2 databasedatasource bean and in the same method I checked if all records are present. This made no difference in the test results. I could only show that just after creation the database is populated as expected. It seems that during bean creation and JUnit test some routine is doing a delete on three specific tables. p  precodepackage de.unit4.financials  import javax.sql.DataSource import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean import org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate import org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.embedded.EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder import org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.embedded.EmbeddedDatabaseType import org.springframework.test.jdbc.JdbcTestUtils   SpringBootApplication public class JUnitConfig   Logger logger  LogManager.getLogger   Bean public DataSource getDataSource      DataSource dataSource  null     if dataSource  null          dataSource  new EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder.setTypeEmbeddedDatabaseType.H2.setNameFanUtilDB                 .addScriptclasspathschema.sql.addScriptclasspathdata.sql.build          logger.infoDatasource dataSource     testDBnew JdbcTemplatedataSource     return dataSource   public void testDBJdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate      countTableRowsoascompany, jdbcTemplate     countTableRowsoasagm, jdbcTemplate     countTableRowsoasagmlist, jdbcTemplate     countTableRowscomusr, jdbcTemplate     countTableRowscomcapab, jdbcTemplate   private void countTableRowsString name, JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate          int anzahl  JdbcTestUtils.countRowsInTablejdbcTemplate, name         logger.infoname      anzahl       codepre  pThis is the outputp  precode085816.007 [main] INFO  Datasource org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.embedded.EmbeddedDatabaseFactoryEmbeddedDataSourceProxy60094a13  de.unit4.financials.JUnitConfig getDataSource 54  085816.197 [main] INFO  oascompany  28  de.unit4.financials.JUnitConfig countTableRows 74  085816.199 [main] INFO  oasagm  2  de.unit4.financials.JUnitConfig countTableRows 74  085816.201 [main] INFO  oasagmlist  2  de.unit4.financials.JUnitConfig countTableRows 74  085816.203 [main] INFO  comusr  52  de.unit4.financials.JUnitConfig countTableRows 74  085816.205 [main] INFO  comcapab  17  de.unit4.financials.JUnitConfig countTableRows 74  codepre  pLater the JUnit test is run and it gives me this resultp  precode085819.099 [main] INFO  Datasource org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.embedded.EmbeddedDatabaseFactoryEmbeddedDataSourceProxy60094a13  de.unit4.financials.periods.CurrentPeriodDBFactory getCurrentPeriod 63  085819.127 [main] INFO  oascompany  0  de.unit4.financials.FinancialsUtilApplicationTests countTableRows 40  085819.128 [main] INFO  oasagm  0  de.unit4.financials.FinancialsUtilApplicationTests countTableRows 40  085819.128 [main] INFO  oasagmlist  0  de.unit4.financials.FinancialsUtilApplicationTests countTableRows 40  085819.129 [main] INFO  comusr  52  de.unit4.financials.FinancialsUtilApplicationTests countTableRows 40  085819.130 [main] INFO  comcapab  17  de.unit4.financials.FinancialsUtilApplicationTests countTableRows 40 codepre  pThe DataSource object seems to be the same, but the record count is different.

Negative 58 pI have an app that contains many different autorenewing subscriptions. When the user subscribes to a new subscription, the receipt a Grand Unified Receipt is uploaded from the app to my server, where it is then sent to Apple and the details returned and interpreted.p  pIve noticed that when users are subscribed to many subscriptions, this receipt can become very long. Additionally, the receipt will naturally become long on its own as the subscriptions autorenew every month and the new entries are inserted into the receipt.p  pThus, the receipts size could potentially become megabytes large, which imposes large data demands on the users cellular service and requires a not insignificant amount of processing time on my server to loop through all of the entries in the receipt to find the one that needs to be recorded.p  pDoes anyone have advice for dealing with this issuep

Negative 58 pSo we have our site running on laravel 4.2 and we have been thinking about upgrading to 5.0 for a long time now. So we have a subdomain that we started building and decided to use laravel 5.1 so that we could get use to it before the migration. Anyways so we have the sub domain setup and installed and it is running however our login is not persisting between the two domains. We have the domain set in session settings on both systems and the cookie gets set but I am assuming laravel 4.2 and 5.1 have different auth systems and so the cookie from 4.2 will not work in 5.1 and vica versa. We have also tried database sessions and file sessions without much luck. p  ol liIs there a way to convert a laravel 4 session into a laravel 5 session so that users can go from our 4.2 main site to our 5.1 sub domain easilyli liIs it possible to make both types of cookie one for the 4.2 and one for the 5.1 at the same time so that users would have both and could use both domainsli liAre we looking at this all wrong and should try something totally different to get what we wantli ol

Negative 58 pCurrently in the process of converting an erlang application from version 17 to 18.  Scalability and performance are prime directives in the design.

Negative 58 pLets say I have a class which looks like this which should either be constructed by value if codeTcode is a simple type like codedoublecode or by reference if codeTcode is more complex.p  pThe code I have so far looks like thisp  precodetemplateltclass Tgt class Val    public     Val  default     Valdouble v  vv       templatelttypename U  Tgt     Valconst ampT v,         typename stdenableifltstdissameltU,doublegtvalue, boolgttype  0      vv    private     T v  codepre  pWhich works, but feels really sketchy, since an additional parameter is introduced into the constructor. Is there a better solution to this problem It seems like this would be better suited for an overload or template specialization solution Can this be solved generally for all simple types codeintcode, codefloatcode, codedoublecode...p

Negative 58 pI have an IM app consisting of 8 Activities 1 Service  bound service forming core app functionality 1 AppGcmListenerServicep  pWhen a GCM push message is received, I need to bindlaunch the Service if it has been killed by the OS, and pass the message on to process. My understanding is that the GcmListenerService will be killed once it exits onMessageReceived, so I dont think asynchronously binding to the Service is an option GcmListenerService may be killed before service has successfully bound.p  pI cant use a LocalBroadcastManager, as the Service may have been killed by the OS needs to be woken by being bound to.p  pI cant convert my service to inherit from GcmListenerService, as this class is not designed to be extended in this way onStartCommand is marked final.p  pAny ideas as to how I could tackle this problem p
