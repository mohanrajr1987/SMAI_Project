Positive 733 pI have a nuget package which lives on a SMB ShareNetwork drive within our company. This package has been included in project which is using TFS Online for source control. We are now trying to use TFS Build however it is failing stating it cant find namespace.p  pContractsIService.cs 7 The type or namespace name Project1 could not be found are you missing a using directive or an assembly referencep  pI am aware that checking in packages into TFS is not a good idea however I cant create a private NuGet feed. The package causing the error is checkedin in the default packages folder, however I am led to believe that the build just ignores these and restores by default.p  pI am using the AzureContinousDeployment.11.xaml process with VS 2103 update 4. After build I want the site to be deployed to a deployment slot on azure websites.p  pIs there away to tell the build server to use just the provided packages and not restorep
Positive 733 pI configured by mistake a local path in my workspace for a project in tfs at the project level. But I wanted this mapping only for subfolders not for the project level.p  pSo I edited my workspace and removed the mapping and now it is not mapped.br I cleared the cache in appdata folder, rebooted but although there is no mapping in my workspace, the project in source control still has the old local path as a property. rightclick, advanced, properties, local name or also the local path in the title bar of source control explorer.p  pRightclick, advanced, and then remove mapping is not available, because the mapping has been removed already. I can map to a local folder, but I dont want to do that, I want it to display not mapped.p

Positive 733 pHi I need to move my source code from one my existing TFS server to a new TFS server that is a clone of my existing one. From what I remember I think both servers are 2012 and I am using Visual Studio 2013 for development.p  pThe clone already has my project on it, but it is an old version of the code. The existing server has the latest code but will be decommissioned soon.p  pWithout having admin access on either server how can I move my code from the existing server with the latest code to the new server with an old version of the code.p  pIs it possible to do this and maintain the project history including the last month of development, or will I only be able to keep the code  TFS is a managed service for me and I dont have the option to stay on the existing server.p  pI have only seen solutions where the new TFS server is clean. p

Positive 733 pWe use TFSonline but have a local build server which defaulted to two build agents when we set it up. Our app is set for continuous builds on checkin.p  pWe found that when building packages the two agents had their own independent build number sequences, so that when agent1 ran it would save our package to NuGet as something like 1.2.3.37032 and then agent2 ran it would create a package 1.2.3.29321p  pHence our deployment server was picking an older build when updating the application.p  pI realise we should also increment the version number e.g. 1.2.4 each time as well, but for every single checkin thats rather laborious.p  pFor now we have had to disable one build agent to prevent this  is there a better way to do this, or a way to ensure the build numbers are sequentialp

Positive 733 pWe are in the process of upgrading our TFS 2013 server to TFS 2015. In that regard I have run into an issue when trying to perform an application build on a build agent with the new version, using our XAML template build script which was created in TFS 2013. p  pMost of our solutions use the abovementioned template when we build them. The solutions sadly, still use setup projects .vdproj to generate an MSI package for the application. To build the setup project, and produce an MSI, for a given application we call the emdevenv.exeem in our case, it points to Visual Studio 2013 in our template build scriptp  precodeCProgram Files x86Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0Common7IDEdevenv.exe Build ReleaseAny CPU dltpathtosolutiongtsolution.sln Out ctempout.log codepre  pHowever, on our new build agent no MSI is produced, and calling emdevenv.exeem yields neither any output, nor any error messages. If I try to call emdevenv.comem, however, it starts building, but still no MSI is being produced.p  pWhen things start to build using emdevenv.comem It seems like it is completely disregarding the setup project I have checked the build configurations, and the setup project is checked for build on the ReleaseAny CPU configuration.p  pI have looked at build logs, build process activity logs, and I have also tried to perform the steps manually on the build agent, but I havent been able to find anything that could point me in the direction as to what might be causing the issue.p  pDoes anyone have an idea what could be the reason for this Could it be an issue with TFS Build 2015 The only difference between the old setup, and the new  as far as I can tell  is the followingp  ol liVS 2013 was installed on C rather than D on the new build agent, i.e. the path to emdevenvem would be different, but that should not matter as long as the build script is looking in the right place, and finds it...li liWe use a different drop location than what we used for the old setupli ol  pAppreciate any help and suggestions I can get.p

Negative 733 pFirst off, I understand the reasons why an interface or abstract class in the .NETC terminology cannot have abstract static methods.  My question is then more focused on the best design solution.p  pWhat I want is a set of helper classes that all have their own static methods such that if I get objects A, B, and C from a third party vendor, I can have helper classes with methods such asp  pre AHelper.RetrieveByIDstring id AHelper.RetrieveByNamestring name AHelper.DumpToDatabase pre  pSince my AHelper, BHelper, and CHelper classes will all basically have the same methods, it seems to makes sense to move these methods to an interface that these classes then derive from.  However, wanting these methods to be static precludes me from having a generic interface or abstract class for all of them to derive from.p  pI could always make these methods nonstatic and then instantiate the objects first such asp  pre AHelper a  new AHelper a.DumpToDatabase pre  pHowever, this code doesnt seem as intuitive to me.  What are your suggestions  Should I abandon using an interface or abstract class altogether the situation Im in now or can this possibly be refactored to accomplish the design Im looking forp

Negative 733 pWere trying to get our company website to be better indexed by Google and other search engines, and at this point Im not quite sure whats missing. All of our text content is loaded in by our flash application via XML files.p  pIn summer, we wrote a PHP script that reads out all the XML files, and generates google friendly index.html files in subdirectories. The files include navigatable links to other sections in the site, and HTML content of the XML files.p  pFor example, for our work section in the flash site, there will be an index.html file generated in the following directory site.comworkindex.htmlp  pThis file contains links to other sections of the site site.comoverview, site.comcontact which all have appropriate index.html files. So people who hit those links can see the site properly, that page actually loads in the site swf from the root directory and goes to the appropriate section of the site automatically. Ie, if you hit site.comwork in your browser, you will see the Flash application and be directed to the work section within it. However, if you browse the site without javascriptflash enabled, you can actually see a series of html links and some paragraphstext content.p  pThis was all done before Googles announcement in June of being able to index external content loaded into SWFs a hrefhttpgooglewebmastercentral.blogspot.com200906flashindexingwithexternalresource.html relnofollowhttpgooglewebmastercentral.blogspot.com200906flashindexingwithexternalresource.htmla.p  pUnfortunately, google seems to only have indexed the main page at site.com even though they say they are capable of indexing flash sites as a user sees them, as above, but I dont even see that working.p  pA couple days ago, I figured a few things may have been missing, so I did the following  submitted a sitemap.xml file to google. It sees 49 URLs, but has only indexed 1. How long would google take to index those files  our main site.comindex.html only had the swf embedded, it didnt have any HTML links to the subsections, so I added those in swfobjects no flash content area  I gathered google wasnt seeing the generated HTML files and instead seeing the embedded SWF, so I disallowed the swf file and the swfobject.js file in the robots.txt filep  pDo the last 3 changes make sense If so, how long after implementing them should I expect to see some results Any help would be appreciatedp

Negative 733 pI am creating an Excel document using owc11. I am providing the dates in ddmmyyyy format. I am doing something like this in the codep  precodefor ..looping through results..

So owc11 thinks that it knows better and swaps the days and month around like in the US format and when it is over the 12th date it sticks to the UK format. p  pVal is declared as String because it may not always be a date. It may be a date, a day, a user name, group name etc depending on how we groupsort our data. Also it may be a selection of days.p  pAfter experimenting a while I figured out that the only way to solve this is to use the universal date format of yyyymmdd. However that may create other integration problems. So I was hoping that there may be a way to enforce the ddmmyyyy format, so please any suggestions are welcome.p

Negative 733 pI want to have a JEditorPane inside a JScrollPane.  When the user clicks a button, the click listener will create a textEditor, call jscrollpane.setViewPorttextEditor, call textEditor.setTextString to fill it with editable text, and call jscrollpane.getVerticalScrollBar.setValue0.  In case youre wondering, yes, the setText must come after the setViewPort for reasons that arent on topic.p  pHere is the problem After the user clicks the button, the JScrollPanes view scrolls all the way to the bottom.  I want the scrollbar to be at the top, as per the last line in my click listener.p  pI popped open a debugger, and to my horror, discovered that the jscrollpanes viewport is being forced down to the bottom after the conclusion of the click listener when pumping filters.  It appears that Swing is delaying the population of the editorjscrollpane until after the conclusion of the clicklistener, but is calling the scrollbar command first.  Thus, the undesired behavior.p  pAnyway, Im wondering if there is a clean solution.  It seems that wanting a scrollpane to be scrolled to the top after modification would be a reasonably common requirement, so Im assuming this is a wellsolved problem.p  pThanksp

Negative 733 pI have a list of users that only administrators can see  few reads. This list also displays a count of the number of users in the datastore. Because the list could grow larger than 1000 my first thought was to avoid a normal count and instead use a sharded counter.p  pHowever, the problem is that the admins also have access to various search filters in the GUI, such as only viewing malefemale users and so on. Its important that the count reflects these filters, so that they can get the number of female users, male users and a myriad of other combinations.p  pBecause of this, sharded counters and high concurrency counters without sharding dont seem like a good idea, because I would need to create a counter for every combination of search filters.p  pShould I simply create a loop of count methods, such as described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions751124howdoesonegetacountofrowsinadatastoremodelingoogleappengineherea or is this very bad practice How would I do it otherwisep  pNote that this counter is for an admin interface and would have a very limited number of reads.

Negative 733 pIm creating a Settings object in my app, used for storing userdefined settings and whatnot. I plan on using various datatypes for my setting fields ints, strings, enums, anything Serializable, really.p  pId also like, if possible, a typesafe way to set any of the settings. My proposed method would be doing something like thisp  precodeTupleltstring, Typegt SettingName  new Tupleltstring, TypegtNumberOfFoos,                                                           typeofTYPE public void SetTupleltstring, Typegt key, TYPE value   Stuff   codepre  pThe Tuple would effectively be the setting that the user would push a value to, and would consist of the key for that setting as well as the type of that setting. What Im wondering is if theres any way to have the compiler enforce that, in the codeSetcode method, the type of codevaluecode is of the same type as the type object saved in the tuple passed to codeSetcode Is the way I proposed even possible Thanksp  pEDIT I thought of some more things I should clarify.p  p1 This is intended to be a static class, so I wont be able to serialize the whole class, only members in it. Therefore, Id really like to not have to deal with a serialization for each field. I was planning on storing all the setting values in a codeDictionaryltstring, TYPEgtcode and serializing that.p  p2 The codeTuplecode definitions are meant to be constant and static. Im really treating them as more of a typedeftype thing I really should make my own SettingKey struct, which the user passes to codeSetcode to indicate what field they are changing. The Type parameter is meant to enforce the the codevaluecode parameter is of the specified type.p

Negative 733 pI am loading a component which makes a HTTPService call to get data that will then be used to set certain variables in the component.  I make the HTTPService call in an init function for the initialization event and then set the variables according to the data received in the HTTPService result handler.  However, the variables are still null at both the initialize stage and at the creationComplete stage.  If I try and read the variables in a creationComp function for the creationComplete event, those variables are still null.  Is this correct  p  pI guess I dont understand the flex initialization cycle very well.  When are those variables actually set and available to be used  I need to manipulate those variables automatically after the component loads.  Is there an event that comes after creationComplete that is appropriate or some other way to approach this  I am using Flex 3.p

The details button then shows a text file with a bunch of stacktrace stuff in which eventually says that the server returned 401 while accessing the .application file mentioned above.p  pI turned on failure auditing for logins on the Win 2003 VM and I can see that when the clickonce fails it is trying to use the local machine account I logged into on the external to my network machine instead of the credentials I entered into the browser on that machine when testing it.p  pMuch Googling and granting of permissions to Network service, everyone etc... on various folders involved later nothing the Report Builder bit just wont install via clickonce due to permissions or the incorrect use there of.p  pIm looking into maybe changing something in the RS to try and grant permissions to the report builder to anonymous but at this point Im pretty pessimistic that Ill actually find anything. The annoying thing about this is that this a test that doesnt represent the final thing well be using custom authentication in RS but unfortunately I have to do it, 8.p  pAny ideas would be most appreciated.p

I have the ability to tweak the firmware on the GPS module which uses an ARM 710 processor, and is not Linux based.p  pI know that the Android SDK does not include APIs to control the USB port.  I am hoping I can connect my GPS host to my android phone using a client mode the phone already supports.  I am having difficulty getting this information.p  pI would appreciate any suggestions, or links on how to do this.p
Negative 733 pI have an C application by which I configure the parameters of an Ethernet camera. The camera acts as a server and the application acts as client. p  pThere are 2 sockets for communication, one for datacommand communication  data socket2 way communication and another socket for image, the camera sends the image via the image socketone way communication. The camera will send the image via image socket whenever a hardware trigger is given to itnot predictable when the hardware trigger would come. p  pThe user can configure the camera by changing the values in the GUI. When user changes a parameter, the applications sends the command and the data to camera via the command socket and waits for responseReceive timeout is 5 sec. The camera receives the command and sends the response back. The GUI receives it updates the user that its successfully updated.p  pI have put the image socket in the background worker.An infinite while loop inside it keeps polling for image in image socket and whenever the image is received, it is displayed in GUII use a delegate to do that. All is well p  pNow, when a trigger has come to camera, it would send the image. At the same instant the user changes a parameter, the application sends the commanddata and waits for response. The camera will receive the command only after sending the image completely. What happens is that the backgroundworkerthat receives the imageis not running when the application is waiting for the response for the command. So, UI  is waiting for response in command socket and camera is sending image in image socket and UI does not receive the image as background worker is not running. It becomes a deadlock and timeout5 sec happens at the command socket .p  pWhy is the backgroundworker not running when the socket is waiting for timeout I replaced the background worker with thread and I set the priority as highest. The error timeout frequency has come down, but the same problem happens occasionaly. Can any of you guys help me sort this and help me understand the problem.p  pThanks, Vishnup

Negative 733 pIm trying to learn Salesforce.coms Apex programming language and I have an example of some code here that comes from the book Development with the Force.com Platform by Jason Ouellette.  Im still learning the basics so please bear with me.  To put this code in context, theres a Services Manager sample application that goes throughout the book and Im examining an Apex trigger device they have written that is suppose to make sure timecards have a valid assignment.  An assignment is a record indicating that a resource is staffed on a project for a certain time period.  A consultant aka resource can enter a timecard only for a project and time period he or she is authorized to work. Resourcec is a parent to both Assignmentc and Timecardc objects.p  pSo here is the code they give me for the trigger and the corresponding apex class. I have been attempting to break it down and commentquestion on it line by line to make sense of its logic.  However, I am still missing some fundamentals here, feel free to help me decipher this.p  p557 The Triggerp  precodetrigger validateTimecard on Timecardc before insert, before update      TimecardManager.handleTimecardChangeTrigger.old, Trigger.new        TheApexClass.methodThatDoesWorkvariable, variable        So there are 2 parameters which are 2 lists, Trigger.old and Trigger.new.        Which means, when this method is called it needs these 2 lists       to process its block of code, right      Why are they called Trigger.old, Trigger.new  Does the order of variables          matter    codepre  p558  The Apex class  which does the work of validating the timecard on behalf of the trigger.p  precode   public class TimecardManager          public class TimecardException extends Exception          public static void handleTimecardChangeListltTimecardcgt oldTimecards, ListltTimecardcgt newTimecards                 Identifying 2 lists of Timecards as parameters, oldTimecards and newTimecards              within the class.  How is this associated with the trigger parameters               that were seen in the trigger above.  Are they the same parameters with               different names  Why are they named differently here  Is it better to              write the trigger first, or the apex class first              SetltIDgt resourceIds  new SetltIDgt   making a new set of primitive data type ID called resourceIds              for Timecardc timecard  newTimecards                     This for loop assigns the timecard variable record to the list of newTimecards                  and then executes the block of code below for each.                  The purpose of this is to identify all the resources that have timecards.                 resourceIds.addtimecard.Resourcec                    It does this by adding the Timecardcs relationship ID from each parent record Resourcec to the resourceIds set.                    For clarification, Resourcec is a parent to both                   Assignmentc and Timecardc objects. Within the Timecardc object, Resourcec                  is a MasterDetail data type.  Is there a relationship ID that is created                   for the relationship between Resourcec and Timecardc                             ListltAssignmentcgt assignments  [ SELECT Id, StartDatec, EndDatec, Resourcec FROM Assignmentc WHERE Resourcec IN resourceIds ]               The purpose of this is to make a list of selected information from Assignmentsc that have resources with timecards.               if assignments.size  0                     If there isnt a Resourcec from Assignmentsc that matches a Resourcec that has a Timecardc,                 throw new TimecardExceptionNo assignments   then an exception is thrown.

So I tried various methods of moving cython to python folder, but since I didnt know where exactly everything goes, those attempts did not come to fruition.p  pIn the interim, I tried to look for different, faster interpreters of python, and installed pypy.

If i use the AND statement for all variables it does not filter appropriately neither does the OR.

Negative 733 pIm writing an Ant script to do some a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6211202writingabuildscriptforaplayframeworkapplicationadditional checksa on my Play Framework Application.p  pCurrently, I am executing my tests from my Ant script by simply making an exec call to play autotest.p  precode    ltexec executableplay.dirplay.batgt         ltarg lineautotestgt     ltexecgt codepre  pWould anyone know how to integrate Clover into a Play test suite  Obviously I am not tied to having to run my tests using the above.p  pI also tried writing the Ant script using the traditional way of executing JUnit tests i.e. using Ants codejunitcode target and I got two problemsp  ul liWhen executing all my tests, only the first would execute successfully while the others would fail for strange reasonsli liIf I just expose one test in my suite and have the test run successfully, it would say I have code coverage of 0.  I then thought I set up clover incorrectly, however, I created a simple class that tested a production class that did nothing and the coverage went up as I would expect.li ul  pSo if I were to go down the codejunitcode route, I would need to know how to execute all my tests so that they can run one after another successfully it works when using the Play way of running codeplay autotestcode and I would need to know why Clover does not seem to pick up lines of code touched by Play tests.p  pI know there is a Cobertura module for Play, however, I find that Clover does a better job telling me an accurate coverage figurep  pbUpdate bUnfortunately I am unable to replicate the exact error I was getting before as I have run into compilation issues when I try and compile things manually.  Ive started to use the Secure module and it only contains Java source files.  So in my Ant script, I call codeplay precompilecode which produces the byte code for the Secure module as well as everything else in the system including my code.  So now when I try and compile my app code using Clover, I think the compiler gets into a bit of a tangle as I have two versions of my classes  one produced by the precompile command nonclover and one produced by my own ant compilation with cloverp  precode[javac] Cprojectstestprojectoutcloverclassesclover8583527041716431332.tmpmodelHouseTest.java45 incompatible types [javac] found    play.db.jpa.JPABase [javac] required models.House [javac]         CLR25115y15ygoxiz3dv.R.inc1527House found  House.findByIdid codepre  pSo I essentially have two problems nowp  ul liI need to be able to compile my source code that also depends on Play provided modules e.g. CRUD, Secure which do not have compiled versions hence my attempt at getting around it by calling codeplay precompilecode myself in my Ant scriptli liOnce I get compilation working, I will undoubtedly have my original issue again of not being able to execute the tests using the codejunitcode target. li ul  pbUpdate 2 bIt turns out that the error I got was due to the codefindByIdcode call required a cast from JPABase to House not that the IDE or play seemed to care about it.  So after I went in and put a cast for all of plays find methods, I actually got JUnit and Clover reports  iHowever...i I am now getting two kinds of errorsp  ul lipEntity classes created in Play can be created by extending the codeModelcode class which provides magic methods such as those codefindcode methods mentioned before as well as the codecountcode method.  The Model superclass actually extends GenericModel which implements those methods by throwing an UnsupportedOperationException.  So obviously Play does some more magic behind the scenes to provide actual implementations of these methods.  Unfortunately, my tests and production code rely on methods such as count but they are throwing the exception in my antjunit scenario note everything works fine when running codeplay autotestcode.pli lipThe other error I am getting is due to the fact that I use the Spring module.  In one of my classes the root class, I call codeSpring.getBeanOfTypeSome.classcode.  Now I use autoscanning, but in the antjunit testing environment, the Spring module has yet to set up my spring container and therefore the call just returns null.pli ul  pI have a feeling there is one magic fix that will resolve both of my issues however I am unsure what that magic fix is.p

It works like this...p  pOn default load no HTTP post, it has two select boxes, bound to the Model, and a submit button.p  pOn submit HTTP post, the values in the select boxes are used to pull some data from the DB.  That data is then added to the model instance that was posted, and the instance is used to issue another ViewmyModelInstance call.p  pAt this point, things look good.  My select boxes retained the selected values, and the new elements based on the DB data are displaying.p  pIf I do another post now, whether I change data or not, the original values selected in the select boxes are null within the Action method of my controller, but the values for the DB data textboxes are not.p  pThe only thing I am really doing special here is using the index notation within Razor to be able to edit parts of my Model that are within an IEnumerable...as in the following example...p  precodefor int i  0 i lt ViewBag.SomeArbitraryNumber i       ltinput typetext namemyModel.MyEnumerable[i].MyValue              valueModel.MyEnumerable[i].MyValue size2 gt  codepre  pThis indexed notation usage only happens after the original select box values have been posted.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong It seems that the major contributor here is the special index notation.

Negative 733 pObviously, a web application needs to adjust to the users keyboard settings, right Is there a way to tell Dojo to make a connection to the actual KeyPress event instead of KeyDown, so we can get the character typed from codeevent.charCodecodep  pSince we live in an international world, with multiple operating systems and what not, this information is not sufficient to find out what character the user actually typed, unless I have some function built into the browser to ask the operating system.p  pAs an example, on a German keyboard on Linux, [ is reached via Alt Gr8, which sends a keydown for Alt and then a keydown with [. Fine, just ignore the first part. On a windows system with a German keyboard, the second event is for an 8 with ctrlKey and altKey set true. Which I dont think JavaScript code should interpret hardcoded, because with other keyboard settings, this key combo will actually mean a different character.p  pAs another example probably not connected to Dojo, but rather a different programmers glitch, sorry for the ranting , with a US keyboard on mac, you cant type the German character  within the outlook web interface  because outlook bogusly hijacks the alt key which on the mac is exclusively used to modify the characters typed to trigger actions and alts is thus remapped to mean send.

Negative 733 pI am making a text renderer for OpenGL 3.3 and 2.1. I know how to do the actual rendering itself, but what Im having problem with is sequencing the vertex data to place in vertex buffer objects. p  pFor each character Im going to render, a 32 byte block of data must be placed in a VBO. I am planning to use one or a few VBO for all the text I render, since binding is a bottleneck in many modern applications. The problem is that the text to be rendered can change between each frame. Sometimes there will be long strings about 200 characters appearing for only a few frames, and sometimes there will be short strings staying for several minutes. I am mainly intending my text rendering engine to be used for games.p  pIf I were to upload all vertex data each frame, it would consume a lot of bus bandwidth, and I would have to move a lot of memory blocks around when a string is deleted, since I cant have holes in the VBO. In other words, I need an algorithm that doesnt transfer more vertex data than needed each frame, and that does not fragment the CPUside buffer too much.p  pI can imagine it would be useful to sort my strings by type for example, short and long strings into different VBOs, or different parts of the same VBO. But I cant think of any specific way to do this, and I dont know exactly how doing it would be beneficial. I would appreciate any advice or guidelines on this matter.p  pI am coding in C, targeting OpenGL 3.3 core, and OpenGL 2.1, if thats relevant.p

Negative 733 pWe are noticing a lot of duplicate records are being created in various tables in our database, but are at a loss as to why this is happening. Interestingly, while the records are otherwise duplicate down to even the codecreatedatcode stamps, on our users table, the password salt and hash are different on each record  which leads me to believe that somehow Rails is somehow running transactionssave operations twice. Obviously, we are not calling codesavecode or codecreatecode multiple times in the application code.p  pThis duplication does not seem to happen with every record saved in the database, and we cannot seem to infer a pattern yet. There is also a codevalidatesuniquenessofcode validation on the User model though not a unique key on the table yet we need to clean up all the duplicates to be able to do that  so Rails should stop itself if a record already exists, but if the requests are firing simultaneously thats a race condition.p  pWe are currently running Rails 3.2.2 behind Passenger 3.0.11nginx on our app servers currently 2 of them, and have one central nginx webserver which sends requests upstream to an app server. Could this setup somehow cause processes to be duplicated or something Would it matter that requests arent locked to one upstream server ie. if one user requests a page that includes static content like images, one or both app servers may be used I feel like thats grasping at straws but I want to cover every possibilityp  pWhat else could cause this to happen p  pemstrongUpdateemstrong As an example, a user was created today which got duplicate records. Both have the codecreatedatcode stamp of code20120328 164811code, and all columns except for codehashedpasswordcode and codesaltcode are identical.

Negative 733 pThis is a bit of an odd question and strongmore of a though experiment that anything I needstrong, but Im still curious about the answer If I have a string that I know ahead of time will never change but is mostly made up of repetitive parts, would it be better to have said string as just a single string object, get called when needed, and be done with it  or should I break the string up into smaller strings that represent the repeated parts and concatenate them when neededp  pLet me use an example  Lets say we have a naive programmer who wants to create a regular expression for validating IP Addresses in other words, I know this regular expression wont work as intended, but it helps show what I mean by repetitive parts and saves me a bit of typing for the second part of the example.  So he writes this functionp  precode private bool isValidIPstring ip      Regex checkIP  new Regexddd.ddd.ddd.ddd    return checkIP.IsMatchip   codepre  pNow our young programmer notices that he has d, d, and . just repeated a few times.  This gives him an idea that he could both save some storage space and help remind himself what this means for later.  So he remakes the functionp  precode private bool isValidIPstring ip      string escape      string digi  d    string digit  escape  digi    string possibleDigit  digit      string IpByte  digit  possibleDigit  possibleDigit    string period  escape  .    Regex checkIP  new RegexIpByte  period  IpByte  period  IpByte  period  IpByte    return checkIP.IsMatchip   codepre  pThe first method is simple.  It just stores 38 chars in the programs instructions, which are just read into memory each time the function is called. The second method stores I suspect two 1 length strings and two chars into the programs instructions as well as all of the calls to concatenate those four into different orders.  This creates at least 8 strings in memory when the program is called the six named strings, a temporary string for the first four parts of the regex, and then the final string created from the previous string  the three strings of the regex.  This second method also happens to help explain what the regex is looking for  though not what the final regex would look like.  It could also help with refactoring, say if our hypothetical programmer realizes that his current regex will allow for more than just 0255 in the IP Address, and the constitute parts can be changed without having to find every single item that would need to be fixed.p  pAgain, which method would be better  Would it just be as simple as a tradeoff between program size vs. memory usage  strongOf course, with something as simple as this, the tradeoff is negligible at best, but what about a much larger, more complex stringstrongp  pOh, yes, and a much better regex for IP Addresses would bep  precode 25[05]2[04]d[01]dd.25[05]2[04]d[01]dd3 codepre  pWouldnt work as well as an example, would itp

Negative 733 pFacebooks a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comroadmapofflineaccessremovaldeprecationa of the codeofflineaccesscode permission is coming May 2012 and the documentation isnt giving us enough information on how to handle it.p  pWe have an iOS app and corresponding service that powers it and integrates with Facebook in a deep way to leverage a users friend list within out app so if your FB friends are also using the app you can more easily connect.  This is like how all social apps seem to work, so nothing special here.p  h2strongClientstrongh2  pOur app uses a hrefhttpsgithub.comfacebookfacebookiossdkFacebook iOS SDKa to allow user to login, which we currently ask for codeofflineaccesscode.  The token is persisted in our iOS app, but also sent to our server where it is saved. The client acts on behalf of user to post updates to a users newsfeed we also ask for codepublishstreamcode permission.  p  h2strongServerstrongh2  pOur server periodically checks to see if users FB friends are now using our app. Next time user signs in, we expose content and relationships in a certain way to promote that users friends.  The server also acts on behalf of the user to periodically connect to the graph API and get the users current friends list. This is so we can account for changes in a users relationships and have them reflected in our app. We do this when the user isnt currently using the app so they have the best experience the next time they do use it.  To enable this, our iOS app sends the access token to our server which it uses and why we ask for codeofflineaccesscode.  p  pstrongNotestrong If user signs out of our app explicitly, we delete the access tokens from both client and server.p  h2strongProblemsstrongh2  pNow that there is no longer a perpetual access token we can use, Im trying to figure out the best practice for still enabling our scenarios while leveraging facebooks new intended way of handling and extending access tokens.

This a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsauthenticationother documenta talks about the first access token request and mentions varying validities but its a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.combugs258370397568648browsesearch4f22d5570e9499881039467uncleara and does it talk about specific validity timesp  pemphasis is minep  blockquote   pWhen you obtain an access token from Facebook, it will be valid   immediately and usable in requests to the API for some time period   defined by Facebook. After that period has elapsed, the access token   is considered to have expired and the user will need to be   authenticated again in order for your app to obtain a fresh access   token. strongThe duration for which a given access token is valid depends on   how it was generated.strongp      pThere are also events which may cause an access token to become   invalid before its expected expiry time. Such events include the user   changing their password, an application refreshing its App Secret.   Dealing with varying access token expiry times, and handling the case   when an access token becomes invalid before its expected expiry time   is essential for building robust social experiences.p blockquote  pstrongB.strong For the client, now that the access token isnt necessarily long lived, is the right approach for us to p  pLet use login through FB, then detect whenever the access token is expired.  If it is, then call into FB iOS SDK to reauthenticationreauthorize this should just trigger user to bounce out to FB iOS app, and in most cases come immediately back to our app with a new access token.p  pstrongC.strong According to a hrefhttpdominicminicoopers.blogspot.com201203facebookaccesstokensandoffline.htmlthis blog posta I found, you can only extend an access token oncep  blockquote   pstrongCan I exchange my 60 day access token for a new 60 day access tokenstrongp      pNo, sorry you cannot. You can only exchange a valid meaning current   user access token for an extended one. You cannot extend an already   extended access token.p blockquote  pOn the client, I can just handle this by prompting a reauthenticationreauthorization as I mentioned in Question B. However, this doesnt work on our server. We could certainly have the server renew it once to 60 days, but what happens on the 61st day The server just stops being able to sync the friends listp  pstrongD.strong It seems to make sense to check the validity of the FB access token every time the app starts or rehydrates from sleep. What is the best way for our iOS app to check this  Is there a recommended endpoint to call to validate a token  Should we just call into codehttpsgraph.facebook.commecode passing the access token and checking the responsep  pNote we can certainly record the codeexpirescode time when we get the initially extended token, but this isnt reliable since the user could revoke our apps permission anytime which makes the codeexpirescode time an unreliable data point on validityp

Negative 733 pIm creating my db using codefirst and entity framework. Im defining all my models which works great, but now I have a Page class which can contain Blocks. These Blocks have a base class with ID, BlockType, Position, Name etcetera but there are different types of blocks with different properties which are classes that inherit from this base class. Im wondering how I can setup my models so the page can have a collection of blocks without storing the custom properties in a comma seperated list or something like that.  Is it possible And what is the good way to model this..p  pThanks in advancep

In the generic method the type is always the base type, even when I call the method from a derived class.p  pI need the generic method to know that it is of the derived type and not the base type.p  pI am not able to change the generic method since it is from a third party app httprazorengine.codeplex.com  codeRazor.Parsecode method.p  pI have found that if I define the method as a generic extension method restricted to types inheriting from my base class that calling this then works but it seems messy to use extension methods for this purpose though if this is correct usage Id be happy to hear that.

Negative 733 p I am trying to automate multiple parallel instances of Office InfoPath 2010 via a windows service. I understand automating Office from a service is not supported however it is a requirement of my customer.p  pI can automate other Office applications in a parallel fashion, however InfoPath behaves differently.p  pWhat I have found is that there will only ever be one instance of the INFOPATH.EXE process created, no matter how many parallel calls to codeCreateObjectInfoPath.Applicationcode are made. In contrast to this, multiple instances of WINWORD.EXE can be created via the similar mechanism codeCreateObjectWord.Applicationcodep  pTo reproduce this issue, a simple console application can be used.p  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodestatic void Mainstring[] args       Create two instances of word in parallel     ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItemWord1     ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItemWord2      System.Threading.Thread.Sleep5000       Attempt to create two instances of infopath in parallel     ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItemInfoPath1     ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItemInfoPath2   static void Word1object context      OfficeInterop.WordTest word  new OfficeInterop.WordTest     word.Test   static void Word2object context      OfficeInterop.WordTest word  new OfficeInterop.WordTest     word.Test   static void InfoPath1object context      OfficeInterop.InfoPathTest infoPath  new OfficeInterop.InfoPathTest     infoPath.Test   static void InfoPath2object context      OfficeInterop.InfoPathTest infoPath  new OfficeInterop.InfoPathTest     infoPath.Test  codepre  pThe InfoPathTest and WordTest classes VB are in another project. p  pre classlangvb prettyprintoverridecodePublic Class InfoPathTest     Public Sub Test         Dim ip As Microsoft.Office.Interop.InfoPath.Application         ip  CreateObjectInfoPath.Application         System.Threading.Thread.Sleep5000         ip.QuitFalse     End Sub End Class  Public Class WordTest     Public Sub Test         Dim app As Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Application         app  CreateObjectWord.Application          System.Threading.Thread.Sleep5000         app.QuitFalse     End Sub End Class codepre  pThe interop classes simply create the automation objects, sleep and then quit although in the case of Word, I have completed more complex tests.p  pWhen running the console app, I can see via Task Manager two WINWORD.EXE processes created in parallel, and only a single INFOPATH.EXE process created. In fact when the first instance of InfoPathTest calls ip.Quit, the INFOPATH.EXE process terminates. When the second instance of InfoPathTest calls ip.Quit, a DCOM timeout exception is thrown  it appears as though the two instances were sharing the same underlying automation object, and that object no longer exists after the first call to ip.Quit.p  pAt this stage my thoughts were only a single INFOPATH.EXE is supported per user login. I expanded the windows service to start two new processes a console application called InfoPathTest, each running under a different user account. These new processes would then attempt to automate INFOPATH.EXEp  pHeres where it gets interesting, this actually works, but only on some machines, and I cannot figure out why that is the case.p  pAnd the service code with help from a hrefhttpasprosys.blogspot.com.au200903perilsandpitfallsoflaunching.htmlAsproLocka p  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic partial class InfoPathService  ServiceBase      private Thread mainThread     private bool isStopping  false      public InfoPathService          InitializeComponent           protected override void OnStartstring[] args          if mainThread  null  mainThread.IsAlive  false              mainThread  new ThreadProcessController             mainThread.Start                    protected override void OnStop          isStopping  true                   public void ProcessController          while isStopping  false              try                   IntPtr hWinSta  GetProcessWindowStation                 WindowStationSecurity ws  new WindowStationSecurityhWinSta, System.Security.AccessControl.AccessControlSections.Access                 ws.AddAccessRulenew WindowStationAccessRuleuser1, WindowStationRights.AllAccess, System.Security.AccessControl.AccessControlType.Allow                 ws.AddAccessRulenew WindowStationAccessRuleuser2, WindowStationRights.AllAccess, System.Security.AccessControl.AccessControlType.Allow                 ws.AcceptChanges                  IntPtr hDesk  GetThreadDesktopGetCurrentThreadId                 DesktopSecurity ds  new DesktopSecurityhDesk, System.Security.AccessControl.AccessControlSections.Access                 ds.AddAccessRulenew DesktopAccessRuleuser1, DesktopRights.AllAccess, System.Security.AccessControl.AccessControlType.Allow                 ds.AddAccessRulenew DesktopAccessRuleuser2, DesktopRights.AllAccess, System.Security.AccessControl.AccessControlType.Allow                 ds.AcceptChanges                  ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItemProcess1                 ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItemProcess2               catch Exception ex                  System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLineString.Format0 Process Controller Error 1, System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId, ex.Message                           Thread.Sleep15000                    private static void Process1object context           SecureString pwd2          Process process2  new Process         process2.StartInfo.FileName  cdebugInfoPathTest.exe          process2.StartInfo.UseShellExecute  false         process2.StartInfo.LoadUserProfile  true         process2.StartInfo.WorkingDirectory  Cdebug         process2.StartInfo.Domain  DEV01         pwd2  new SecureString foreach char c in password  pwd2.AppendCharc          process2.StartInfo.Password  pwd2         process2.StartInfo.UserName  user1         process2.Start          process2.WaitForExit           private static void Process2object context          SecureString pwd2          Process process2  new Process         process2.StartInfo.FileName  cdebugInfoPathTest.exe         process2.StartInfo.UseShellExecute  false         process2.StartInfo.LoadUserProfile  true         process2.StartInfo.WorkingDirectory  Cdebug         process2.StartInfo.Domain  DEV01         pwd2  new SecureString foreach char c in password  pwd2.AppendCharc          process2.StartInfo.Password  pwd2         process2.StartInfo.UserName  user2         process2.Start          process2.WaitForExit           [DllImportuser32.dll, SetLastError  true]     public static extern IntPtr GetProcessWindowStation      [DllImportuser32.dll, SetLastError  true]     public static extern IntPtr GetThreadDesktopint dwThreadId      [DllImportkernel32.dll, SetLastError  true]     public static extern int GetCurrentThreadId   codepre  pThe InfoPathTest.exe process simply calls the InfoPathTest.Test method detailed above.p  pIn summary, this works, but only on certain machines.

Negative 733 pI am working on a series of web applications written using Google Web Toolkit GWT. As part of our testing we have successfully used seleniumrc for a long time. We are looking to migrate to Selenium 2 and use the WebDriver interface.p  pThe complication is that one of our clients is a custom .Net application which launches our web applications using an embedded QT Webkit browser. We are concerned that moving to Selenium 2 will mean that we are unable to run Selenium tests in this client which will be a big problem as it currently comprises the majority of our clients.p  pHaving done some research all I have been able to find is the a hrefhttpcode.google.compwebkitdriverwebkitdrivera project on Google code. However this just seems to support testing against a headless webkit which isnt what we want.p  pDoes anyone else have any experience of testing an embedded QT webkit browser using Selenium 2 and WebDriver I would love to be able to make this work.p

Negative 733 pI understand that codeThread.currentThread.yieldcode is a notification to thread scheduler that it may assign cpu cycle to some other thread of same priority if any such is present. My question is If current thread has got lock on some object and calls codeyieldcode, will it loses that lock right away And when thread scheduler finds out there is no such thread to assign cpu cycle, then the thread which has called codeyieldcode will again be in fight to get lock on the object which it has lost earlierp  pI couldnt find it in javadoc and forums [httpwww.coderanch.comt226223javaprogrammerSCJPcertificationdoessleepyieldreleaselock] have 5050 answers.p  pI think codeyieldcode lets say thread1 should release lock because if some thread lets say thread2 of same priority wants to operate on same object, then it can have chance when thread scheduler eventually assign cup to thread2.p
Negative 733 pThis post rambles a bit so before I get into it I want to be clear what Im asking Have you added moveenabled setters to your code and have you found its worth the effort And how much of the behaviour Ive found can I expect might be compilerspecificp  pWhat Im looking at here is whether its worth while to add a moveenabled setter function in cases where Im setting a property of a complex type. Here I have moveenabled codeBarcode and codeFoocode which has a codeBarcode property which may be set.p  precodeclass Bar  public     Bar  array1000      BarBar const amp other  arrayother.array      BarBar ampamp other  arraystdmoveother.array      Bar amp operatorBar const amp other          array  other.array         return this          Bar amp operatorBar ampamp other          array  stdmoveother.array         return this      private     vectorltstringgt array   class Foo  public     void SetBarByCopyBar value          bar  value          void SetBarByMovedCopyBar value          bar  stdmovevalue          void SetBarByConstRefBar const amp value          bar  value          void SetBarByMoveBar ampamp value          bar  stdmovevalue      private     Bar bar  codepre  pGenerally speaking in the past Ive gone with a constref for setter functions for non builtin types. The options I looked at were to pass byvalue then move codeSetByMovedCopycode, pass by constref then copy codeSetByConstRefcode and finally to accept by rvalueref then move codeSetByMovecode. As a baseline I also included passbyvalue then copy codeSetByCopycode. FWIW, the compiler complained of ambiguity if including both passbyvalue and rvalueref overloads.p  pIn experiments with the VS2010 compiler, this is what Ive foundp  precodeFoo foo Bar barone  foo.SetByCopybarone  Barcopy ctor called to construct value from barone  FooSetByCopy entered  Barcopy operator called to copy value to bar  FooSetByCopy exiting  Bardtor called on value codepre  pcodevaluecode is copyconstructed from codebaronecode, then codevaluecode is copied to codebarcode. codevaluecode is destructed and incurs any costs of destructing a complete object. 2 copy operations are executed.p  precodefoo.SetByMovedCopybarone  Barcopy ctor called to construct value from barone  FooSetByCopy entered  Barmove operator called to move value into bar  FooSetByCopy exiting  Bardtor called to destruct the moved value codepre  pcodevaluecode is copyconstructed from codebaronecode, then codevaluecode is moved into codebarcode, then the gutted codevaluecode is destructed after the function exits, presumably at lower cost. 1 copy and 1 move operation.p  precodefoo.SetByConstRefbarone  FooSetByConstRef entered  Barcopy operator called to copy barone into bar  FooSetByConstRef exiting codepre  pcodebaronecode is copied directly into codebarcode. 1 copy operation.p  precodefoo.SetByMovestdmovebarone  FooSetByMove entered  Barmove operator called to move value into bar  FooSetByMove exited codepre  pcodebaronecode is moved directly into codebarcode. 1 move operation.p  hr  pSo the constref and move versions are the most efficient in this case. Now, more to the point, what Im looking to do is something like thisp  precodevoid SetBarBar const amp value  bar  value  void SetBarBar ampamp value  bar  stdmovevalue  codepre  pWhat Ive found happens here is that if you call codeFooSetBarcode, the compiler picks the function based on whether youre passing an lvalue or an rvalue. You can force the issue by calling codestdmovecode as suchp  precodefoo.SetBarbarone  Constref version called foo.SetBarBar  Move version called foo.SetBarstdmovebarone  Move version called codepre  pI shudder to think of adding all these move setters, but I think it might result in a pretty significant performance gain in cases where a temporary is passed to the codeSetBarcode function and going forward I can gain even more by applying codestdmovecode where appropriate.p

Negative 733 pMy system memory is plenty a server with 24GB. In my system, the kernel space is allocated with 320MB and 120MB for crash kernel. The rest of the memory is used for other purposes. However, when I use codegetfreepagescode to allocate contiguous pages with order of 11, and the kernel fails to allocate 210 pages. Whyp  pAccording to a hrefhttpwww.makelinux.netldd3chp8sect3 relnofollowmakelinuxap  blockquote   pThe maximum allowed value for order is 10 or 11 corresponding to 1024   or 2048 pages, depending on the architecture. The chances of an   order10 allocation succeeding on anything other than a freshly booted   system with a lot of memory are small, however.p blockquote  pWhy is that so Each page in my system is 4KB 4096 bytes, 210 pages  1024 pages, and the total size is 10244096  4 194 304 bytes  4MB. Its only 4MB of contiguous space and the kernel is very small vmlinuz is only 2.1MB and initrd is 15MB. The total memory consumption of the whole kernel is 300MB. It must be more than enough for the kernel to allocate 4MB of contiguous pages. Even in normal machine with 1GB3GB kerneluser, and sure the kernel wont use up the whole 1 GB. But how can the allocation with only 4MB contiguous pages possibly fail And I think, in kernel space, memory is not scattered in physical memory due to virtual memory mapping, but is linear and contiguous.p  pI tried to load my kernel module first with 210 pages allocation, but it fails and dump the stack tracep  precode[    6.037056]  [ltffffffff810041ecgt] dumptrace0x860x2de [    6.037063]  [ltffffffff8122fe83gt] dumpstack0x690x6f [    6.037070]  [ltffffffff8108704egt] warnallocfailed0x13f0x151 [    6.037076]  [ltffffffff8108786agt] allocpagesnodemask0x80a0x871 [    6.037081]  [ltffffffff81087959gt] getfreepages0x120x50 codepre

Negative 733 pI have started monitoring my ISPs downtimes with a looping PHP script which checks the connection automatically every 5 seconds and stores the result in MySQL database.

Negative 733 pIm building an auctions app for Shopify. The way it would work is that it would use a payment gateway like Stripe to capture the payment details of a bid and then execute the winning bid at the end of the auction, cancelling the remaining bids. It would then notify the Shopify store through the API, that the product variant has been sold.p  pSince a delayed captureauthorization workflow is not possible using the conventional payment gatewayswhich dont use a payment tokenization system, the app would need the merchant to enter their Stripe credentials in the app not Shopify. The app would then create a charge by itself for winning bid, and not go through Shopifys Charge process.p  pMy question is that, is it possible to mark an product variant sold through the Shopify API, without creating a Shopify Charge, or by creating a dummy charge since now the app not Shopify charges the customer without changing the merchants order processing workflow.p  pI know its kind of a complicated question. Any insights would be much appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 733 pSo I want to compare some records in Crystal Reports to take care of a problem a bug in our system has caused. p  pSo every once in a while our system charges someone twice. I want to find all those ordersshipments. An order can have multiple shipments if we have one item on backorder we ship out the rest of the order in one shipment and then ship out the backordered item in another shipment. The shipment also has a codechargedatecode field thats a date time stamp when we charged the customer. So if we grouped it in Crystal reports it would look like thisp  precode    Order Id 234587               Shipment Id 121    chargedate 8292012 114321               Shipment Id 524    chargedate 912012 153739 codepre  pShipments are created in numerical order. So if we send out one shipment, say shipment number 345, then the next shipment we send out, regardless of what order its a part of, will be shipment number 346.p  pSo, when someone is a victim of our bug then their shipments are right after one another and their codechargedatecode are exactly the same. Like sop  precode    Order Id 69875               Shipment Id 594     chargedate 922012 143215               Shipment Id 595     chargedate 922012 143215 codepre  pI can create a list of just shipments and their charge date without grouping on Order Id and sorting them in ascending order. But what I want to do is iterate through the list of shipments and compare each shipment to the previous shipment and see if the codechargedatecodes are equal and if they are then select them or mark them or something so that I can group them by a formula and take care of them. p  pIs this possible in Crystal Should I use a different program I realize this might not be the best way to do this so Im open to suggestions. Thanks in advancep

Negative 733 pI want to use reactivebanana to write a traveller game that people can write bots for. FRP is completely new to me, and Im having trouble making a start. I created a more elaborate Graph, when I began, but for my purposes here, I have tried to make it as simple as possible. Id like some guidance, mostly on where to begin, and how to break this bigger problem down into smaller problems to solve. Heres the initial design.p  pThe idea is to have a Graph of LNodes with weighted edges I am ignoring for now for simplicitys sake. These LNodes I describe as codePlanetcodes. The codePlanetcodes have a name, a Map of the Players on the codePlanetcode and codeResourcecodes. Players have an id, resources and a Planet.Heres the Data Structues and some associated functions, followed by more discussion.p  precode Graphbuilding records and functions  data PlanetName  Vulcan                  Mongo                  Arakis                  Dantooine                  Tatooine                      deriving Enum,Bounded,Show  data Planet  Planet pName  PlanetName                      ,player  IntMap Player                      ,resources  Int                       deriving Show  data Player  Player pid  Int                     ,resources  Int                      deriving Show    makePlanetNodes  PlanetName gt [LNode Planet] makePlanetNodes planet  Prelude.map makePlanetNodes                           zip [planet ..] [0 ..]   where makePlanetNodes planet,i            i,Planet pName  planet, players  IM.empty  makePlanetGraph p  mkGraph p [0,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,4,3,4,3,4,0,2]   Networking and command functions  prepareSocket  PortNumber gt IO Socket prepareSocket port  do    sock lt socket AFINET Stream defaultProtocol    let socketAddress  SockAddrInet port 0000    bindSocket sock socketAddress    listen sock 1    putStrLn  Listening on   show port    return sock  acceptConnections  Socket gt IO  acceptConnections sock  do    forever  do        sock, sockAddr lt Network.Socket.accept sock        handle lt socketToHandle sock ReadWriteMode        sockHandler sock handle  sockHandler  Socket gt Handle gt IO  sockHandler sock handle  do     hSetBuffering handle LineBuffering     forkIO   commandProcessor handle     return   commandProcessor  Handle gt IO  commandProcessor handle  untilM hIsEOF handle handleCommand gtgt hClose handle   where     handleCommand  do         line lt hGetLine handle         let cmdarg  words line         case cmd of             echo gt echoCommand handle arg             move gt moveCommand handle arg             join gt joinCommand handle arg             take gt takeCommand handle arg             give gt giveCommand handle arg              gt do hPutStrLn handle Unknown command   echoCommand  Handle gt [String] gt IO  echoCommand handle arg  do     hPutStrLn handle unwords arg  moveCommand  undefined  joinCommand  undefined  takeCommand  undefined  giveCommand  undefined codepre  pHeres what I know so far, my Events will involve types codePlanetcode and codePlayercode. Behaviors will involve move,join,take,and give. When a player joins, it will create a new codePlayercode event and update the Map on Vulcan with that codePlayercode. Move will allow a traversal from one codeLNodecode to another,provided the codeLNodecodes are connected by an edge. Take will remove coderesourcescode from the current codePlanetcode the codePlayercode is on and add those coderesourcescode to the codePlayercode.

Negative 733 pSo far most of the stuff in this combined setup works well enough. However, when I try to conditionally disable filters, they are simply always enabled. My scenario is more or less that I want to give codeRestaurantcode owners codeAdminUsercodes with the role coderestaurateurcode partial access they can only edit their own Restaurant, and I also want to hide some fields from them, too.

Negative 733 pI am coding in ObjectiveC  CocoaTouch for iPhone, and I was wondering, is it ever OK to not chain initializers For instance, in my parent class I have three initializers that all need to be inherited from by child class.

Negative 733 h1Situationh1  pThe company signs a contract with a client. Part of the contract requires that the client provides some access details to its own server.p  pThe contract is sent in .doc format to the client, and the client needs to fill in the contract with its information, sign it, print it, scan it and send it back via email so that we can work with it, until the physical contract arrives via courier.p  h1Issueh1  pWith the contract, there is also sent a note indicating that all the information must be filled in electronically, and then printed. However, most of the clients simply print the contract, then fill it in by hand before scanning, which makes the retrieval of the information contained within quite difficult sometimes.p  h1Solutionh1  pThe only one we had thinked about is to send the contract in a PDF format, containing a fillable form and a script that will prevent the user from printing the document if the form is not filled in or at least nag the printing process with some messages if it is not possible to prevent printingp  h1Questionh1  ol liIs it even possible If so, where can I find examplesresources for thisli liAre there other better options availableli ol  pI have located some resources regarding scripting a hrefhttpwww.pdfscripting.com relnofollow titlePDFScripting.comPDFScripting.coma and a hrefhttpwww.adobe.comdevnetacrobatjavascript.html relnofollow titleJavaScript for AcrobatJavaScript for Acrobata from Adobe.

Negative 733 pHello everybody in StackOverflow, Im a Fan of this site, has helped me out of countless pits. But this time I dont seem to find the answer here or anywhere else, my problem is thisp  pIm developing a Yii Framework Application for handling of data within a database, keeping consistance and everything. Basically, Im creating an interface for manipulting DB information. Im using MySQL 5.0 Scheduled update to 5.5 and InnoDB.p  pMy development is coming to support an alreadyexisting schema Ill call it strongmainstrong, which has several design problems. We aim to replace the old schema with a new, rightly designed one Ill call it strongshadowstrong. But for the meantime, we are trying to implement the new schema as a shadowschema of the main one, and keeping changes consistant via triggers.p  pAll the important changes are made to the shadow schema, which reflects it to the main schema using triggers. Both schemas are hosted in the same server, and the triggers work great reflecting data changes from shadow to main whenever changes are made via command line client or using MySQL Workbench, but whenever I make changes using my Yii application to shadow data... the changes are only made to the shadow schema and not triggerreflected to the main schema. p  pThis is the

Negative 733 pI am running into this weird problem. I just put my application on a server, and I have a login with facebook functionality. When I click on the login with facebook it redirects me to facebook login and I put the credentials then submit it, but when I get redirected to the controller method which is supposed to redirect to my website home, I get an internal server error even though the script seems to run since I can see that the session variables have been created. And the weird thing is, that it is working fine on my development environment localhost. Any ideas Is it a file permission issue, or PHP installation issue Other features are working fine . p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 733 pIf you go to Game rules section and click around the sections Backgammon, Narde, Nackgammon, Tavla, Old English you will see that some sections load normally and the scrollbar works fine. Bigger sections like Backgammon and Narde do not load fully. The content in backgammon section is going out of the margin and the Narde section simply wont load fully.p  pWhat could be the issue here All of the sections with scrollbar have the same identical settings. The only difference is that Backgammon and Narde sections have more text and more images. Could this be a reason for the glitch Maybe the plugin somehow doesnt get to load all the content and already locks itself in place What could be the possible solutionsp  pEDIT Im pretty sure it has something to do with tinyscrollbar plugin loading a bit too fast before the inside content has loaded.

Negative 733 pI currently have a task to take Options Symbols and make them easily searchable from a cache for fast lookups from various different applications both web and windows based.  We have settled on making a WFC service to return the results for us.br There are approx 500k records that are needed to cache.  When we do this our memory footprint is approximately 400 MB using a Trie Object. I was instructed to make that smaller.  p  pAn option symbol looks like this in our world codeROOTDATESTRINGPRICETYPEcode or codeIBM130119215.0Ccodep  pSo I was thinking that since there is tons of duplication in this I could build a Trie for each part which when finished made the memory usage approx 30 MB.  p  pSo my dilemma now is how to link them so it still appears as one continuous Trie for searching.  If I do a simple parent child I can end up with false results since the parent of the Price is Date and that could have prices that do not occur for that ROOT or Type.  Our current approach is to use another object that is a linking object similar to a join table in a database.  We have each final node with an UniqueID and then build the appropriate relationship.  This is still very fast and does not take huge amounts of memory but I was wondering what others may suggest as a way to link these items in a more efficient manner.p  pAdditional Info So each part of the option symbol in my current implementation is its own individual Trie. So if I have Options that are IBM130119215.0C APPL130119215.0C APPL130119600.0C A130119310C IBM130119220.0C IBM130119215.0P I would subsequently build a trie for the root like  There is an end value as part of my node structure to know where I have hit an end.p  pre     root          Date                  Price                OptType                                                              A    I           1                  2      3  6           P   C                                                 A  B           3                2   1    1  0                                                  P  M           0                0   5    .  0                                                   L              1                .   .    0  .                                                                   1                0   0    0  0                                           9  pre  pSo without a way to link each of these I could get many false positives by just using Parent Child.  Since the Child of Date is Price. I had thought about putting all the parent child pieces on the Root, making that a special type of NODE so as to not have a bunch of null data out there for others that are not needed.  but we settled on a linking table, however that is not working well at all.  I am not set that this is the right implementation, but we do need to CACHE all of these records due to the number of calls and frequency of them.  p

Negative 733 pGoing from Joomla 2.5 to 3.0 with my extension, Im struggling with how to do the DB error handling since GetErrorNum is deprecated, see also a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13967904joomlajdatabasegeterrornumisdeprecateduseexceptionhandlinginsteadJoomla JDatabasegetErrorNum is deprecated, use exception handling insteada.p  pThe way that seems to be the one to go according to the question linked above, is to add the following code for each codedbgtquerycode codep  precodeif dbgtquery      throw new ExceptiondbgtgetErrorMsg  codepre  pIn my opinion, that makes DB error handling more awkward than it was before. So far, I simply called a codecheckDBErrorcode function after a DB call, which queried the ErrorNum and handled any possible error accordingly.p  pThat was independent from how the DB query was actually triggered  there are different ways to do that, and different results on an error codedbgtloadResultcode returns codenullcode on error, codedbgtquerycode returns codefalsecode. So there will now be emdifferentem checks for different DB access types.p  pIsnt there any generic way to handle this, e.g. a way to tell Joomla to throw some exception on DB problems Or do I have to write my own wrapper around the DatabaseDriver to achieve that Or am I maybe missing something obviousp  pOr should I just ignore the deprecation warning for now and continue with using getErrorNum Id like to make my extension futureproof, but I also dont want to clutter it too much with awkward error handling logic.p

Negative 733 pI am creating a decorator that catches a raised error in its target function, and allows the user to continue executing the script bypassing the function or drop out of the script.p  precodedef catcherrorfunc          This decorator is used to make sure that if a decorated function breaks      in the execution of a script, the script doesnt automatically crash.      Instead, it gives you the choice to continue or gracefully exit.               def caughtargs         try             return funcargs         except Exception as err             question  n0 failed.

This works well for functions that only return a single value, but it is crashing on functions that attempt to unpack multiple values. For instance,p  precode Both function and decorator return single value, so works fine oneval  decoratorworksforthisfunc   Function nominally returns two values, but decorator only one, so this breaks script oneval, twoval  decoratordoesntworkforthisfunc codepre  pIs there a way that I can determine the number of values my target function is supposed to return For instance, something likep  precodedef bettercatcherrorfunc     def caughtargs         try             return funcargs         except Exception as err             ...             numrvals  determinenumrvalsfunc             if numrvals gt 1                 return [ None for count in rangenumrvals ]             else                 return None                    return caught codepre  pAs always, if there is a better way to do this sort of thing, please let me know. Thanksp  pUPDATEp  pThanks for all the suggestions. I decided to narrow the scope of catcherror to a single class of functions, which only return one string value. I just split all the functions returning more than one value into separate functions that return a single value to make them compatible. I had been hoping to make catcherror more generic and there were several helpful suggestions on how to do that, but for my application it was a little overkill. Thanks again.p

Negative 733 pThis is an optional question in a course Im taking, and they provide the answer, 4n.  But now matter how much I think about it I cannot figure out how they came to this.  Im still very new and just learning about big O notation so Im sure Im missing something simple but it doesnt make sense to me.  The way I think about it is bubble sort requires n  k operations, so if you make k into 2k I have n  2k.  And I believe in worstcase scenario k  n  1 so its practically n  2n AKA 3n.  Im probably doing this completely wrong, but thats why Im here for help.  My course didnt really or I dont feel it covered a problem like this so Im just not sure how to approach it.  Thanksp

Negative 733 pI am trying to store a very large search mask with a filter of bits.p  pBoth codestdvectorltboolgtcode and codestdbitsetltngtcode store their bool representations as bits, which is different from a normal bool which is usually the size of a codecharcode or codeint32tcode.p  pThe problem is both of those data structures store their elements in memory in one giant block. The operating systems are getting mad at me for requesting blocks that are too big.  One thing codestddequeltboolgtcode does is store its elements in something like a linked list I think.p  pNow I know you cannot use a pointer to a single bit without shifting, and using a linked list type structure defeats the purpose of memory conservation.  But you could store like a 2gig block of codechar[]code, use shifts to set individual bits, and then a linked pointer to another 2gb block, you digp  pSo tell me if this type of structure exists somewhere or is even possible.p

Negative 733 pWe have an application that autogenerates a certificate and binds it, using httpapi, to a selected port. Under Windows 7, and 20032008 Servers this works like a charm. The certificate can also be rebound to other ports by unbinding, then binding to the new port.p  pUnder Windows 8, however, only unbinding from the old port succeeds. An attempt to bind the certificate to the new port value fails with error code 1312 revealing the message A specified logon session does not exist. It may already have been terminated. p  pWhats odd here is that when trying to add a bound certificate through strongnetshstrong it also fails, in elevated console, with the same error and message SSL Certificate add failed, Error 1312A specified logon session does not exist.

When the trivia menu is up, players should not be able to click on the roll dice button on the board layer.p  pWe have tried implementing this by calling codedice.isTouchEnabledNOcode right before adding the trivia layer, but we cant figure out how to reenable the dice button.p  pWe also tried changing codeccTouchBegancode from NO to YES to always consume all of the touches, but then it stops responding to our menu. It seems that this should be the right way to do it, but why did the menu stop responding thenp  pOur professor suggested implementing a callback function, which we of course can do, but it seems like it should be easier than that.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestionsp

Negative 733 pI have a project in which, when a particular activity is called from an explicit intent, i have a crash followed by this type of error. The fact that i dont understand is how on devices with android 4.0 or higher everything works fine. I have tried to run the application on android 2.2 and android 2.3 and i have the crash with this error. The activity that causes the crash doesnt require any type of external jars, except for the androidsupportv4 one.

Negative 733 pI have an application which dynamically loads jvm.dll, therefore I need to know where the DLL resides. Currently I am trying standard locations like codeCProgram FilesJavajdk...jrebinserverjvm.dllcode. However this is quite tedious and error prone due to version numbers etc. and a more sophisticated solution would require some intelligence in my application to determine the correct path. In the worst case I end up asking the user to specify where jvm.dll resides.p  pOn Mac OS X there is a method to find the Java Home directory using usrlibexecjavahome, on Linux I am mostly fine with simply finding out where codejavaccode resides and following symlinks.

Negative 733 pSummaryp  pI want to be able to use Scroll from Source to locate a file in the filesystem tree.  For normal modules this works well.  However, when I include an additional source root for some generated code in a module, IntelliJ creates a virtual module in the left pane with a duplicate copy of the sources, and Scroll from Source sometimes navigates there instead of in the filesystem tree.p  pHow can I add an additional source root such that it does not result in virtual module entries in the left panep  pMore detailsp  pI am using IntelliJ 12.1.3 with an Android project that has several modules.  Most of the IntelliJ modules include two source roots one for the actual source and one for Android generated sources.  Some of the modules also include source generated by an external tool.  These modules include a third source root.p  pIn the left pane, the modules with the additional source root show up as virtual module entries at the toplevel and in the directory tree where the .iml file is found, but the modules with just android generated source just appear in the directory tree.p  pThe virtual module entries cause problems during Scroll from Source since IntelliJ sometimes scrolls to the virtual module rather than the source location in the tree.  p  pI experimented with groups, but groups did not solve the issue of the files showing up in two places, and they further obscured the filesystem tree.p  pBecause the Android gen directory does not cause these virtual modules to appear, there must be a way to convince IntelliJ that some source roots are less interesting.  However, in the .iml file, the Android entry and the annotation processing entry look identical aside from referencing different paths.  The android source root value also appears under the android facet as the values for options named GENFOLDERRELATIVEPATHAPT and GENFOLDERRELATIVEPATHAIDLis the android plugin doing something special here to make its gen folder avoid triggering the virtual modulep

Negative 733 pIm trying to automate a certain control Teleriks Rad GridView with Microsofts UIA. I have created a wrapper class that exposes several helper methods for my test to use  the most prominent example being a GetAllRows method that returns a collection of all grid rows.p  pMy problem is that this particular control is virtualized, meaning that only the visible rows are rendered and represented in the UI at any given time. To get all rows, Im forced to use the ScrollPattern and repeatedly scroll down until I reach a 100 scroll, each time requesting all child row elements. Besides this being sheer ugly code, Im also faced with the problem of removing rows that were picked up several times, which is complicated because in this particular grid, duplicate values are allowed. p  pMicrosoft recommends using the ItemContainer pattern which allows to request all AutomationElements under a particular control given a condition, regardless of whether or not theyre virtualized. You can then use the VirtualizedItemPatterns Realize method to bring the AutomationElement into view and render it.p  pThis would have worked, unfortunately Telerik have not implemented this Control Pattern for their Grid View, and even if they did, I would have problems using it as grid rows are not getting a unique AutomationId which makes it hard to formulate a Condition object which the ItemContainer pattern would utilize. p  pDoes anyone have any idea on how would this be possible more elegantly I dont have a problem with implementing a scroller method to render the rows, but I dont want to deal with removing duplicate AutomationElements.p

Negative 733 pthe last few days i red a lot about the difference of function expression and declarations in javascript. Most of the time it said that function expression are the preferred way to create functions in javascript. Sometimes it said the opposite, so im not sure, but i stay with expressions for now. p  pBut there is one thing about expressions i couldnt find as an example. It might be a stupid question, but i would really like to know. Lets assume we have a function expression likep  precodevar nav       init function           Code     ,      open function           Code     ,     close function           Code       codepre  pIn that case it is a function for a drop down navigation or something. You should be able to open and close it, just as an example. Now im asking you, how do i define variables in that code, so i can use those both in the open, close and init functions In that particular case i probably need variables likep  precodevar     nav  .nav,     navHeight  nav.height,     navTest  Test codepre  pHow would you normally do that It may be that this questions was already answered elsewhere, but i really couldnt find anything, maybe because i searched for the wrong keywords.p  pI would be really thankful if somebody could explain me  send me a link to a tutorial  for an javascript function beginner p  pThanks p

Negative 733 pK.Sierra and B.Bates in their book SCJP Study Guide writep  pemThe following is legal codebyte b  27code but only because the compiler automatically narrows the literal value to a byte. In other words, the compiler puts in the cast. The preceding code is identical to the following codebyte b  byte 27codeemp  pIn my opinion this explanation is incorrect. strongAre these two lines of code identicalstrongp  pIn factp  precodebyte b  27 codepre  pis simply a constant. And the compiletime narrowing of constants is the only reason why this code is valid. So no cast is needed. When narrowing the compiler just checks whether the specified value fits in the type of the variable. The a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasespecsjlsse7htmljls5.htmljls5.2 relnofollowspecificationa says p  blockquote   pA narrowing primitive conversion may be used if the type of the variable is embyteem, emshortem, or emcharem, and the value of the constant expression is representable in the type of the variable.p blockquote  pIn the second case p  precodebyte b  byte 27 codepre  pcasting does occur during at runtime and the primitive value is computed according to specific rules. The compiler doesnt care about the compatibility of primitive types. For examplep  precodebyte b  5.0  compile error byte b  277777777  compile error byte b  byte 5.0  valid byte b  byte 277777777  valid codepre  pThis makes me think that wideningnarrowing conversion and casting are fundamentally different. But in various sources they are often used interchangeably. Is this correct Does casting occur under the covers in case of an implicit narrowing conversionp  pstrongCan anyone explain the real behavior of the compiler in the situation described in the above bookstrongp

Negative 733 pIm using JSP for a Project and cache all the records from the database which are visible and editable for every user. For this purpose I use a Bean and set the scope to application.p  pIts constructor includes the logic to fetch the data and works fine. If something is changed there are methods to take care about that. NOT gettersetter Now it occurs always after I wait a specified time the constructor is called again and for some reason I dont know yet in that case the connection to the database fails. Connection Time out on an MSSQL Server 2012p  pIm a bit puzzled about that. As I know as the scope is set to application it doesnt depend on the session or whatever any more. On the other hand it might be the case I use the constructor in the wrong way. When is the constructor called if the scope is application Id say just once as the whole Application is used the first time. Am I wrongp

Negative 733 pI have two entities, invoices and sales tax. Recently my team has decided to upgrade to Symfony 2.3 from 2.1. We had to rewrite a lot of the ways we were doing queries because of this, and some entities that didnt have relationships needed to have them.p  pBefore the update, my invoices and sales tax records were created by getting the transaction id codedateUcode and setting up both with the same transaction id both tables have a primary index id as well.p  pSo you can imagine it looks like this Sales Tax id, transactionid, amount Invoice id, transactionid, amountp  pSo when I queried for them I just joined on the transaction id. Now joins arent working without relationships, so Im having to update this to have a relationship. But when I go to create an invoice or sales tax record, I get this error codeNotice Undefined index transactionId in CfoldersvendordoctrineormlibDoctrineORMPersistersBasicEntityPersister.php line 539code.p  pIn the code the sales tax record is being created just fine, but when it goes to create the invoice it failsp  precodepublic function insertSalesTaxtransactionId, amount      tax  new SalesTax      taxgtsetAmountamount     taxgtsetTransactionIdtransactionId      thisgtentityManagergtpersisttax     thisgtentityManagergtflush      return tax  codepre  pThat inserts, but then I take that tax record and try to create the invoicep  precode    invoice  new Invoice     em  thisgtentityManager      invoice omitted other invoice data         gtsetSalesTaxsalesData[salesTax]      emgtpersistinvoice     emgtflush codepre  pHeres the relevant portions of my mapping in ymlp  precodeBundleEntityInvoice   type entity   table invoices   indexes     transactionId       columns [ transactionid ]   id     id       type integer       generator  strategy AUTO    manyToOne     salesTax       targetEntity SalesTax       inversedBy invoice       joinColumn         name transactionid         referencedColumnName transactionid codepre  pAnd SalesTaxp  precodeBundleEntitySalesTax   type entity   table salestaxes   indexes     transactionId       columns [ transactionid ]   id     id       type integer       generator  strategy AUTO    oneToMany     invoice       targetEntity Invoice       mappedBy salesTax codepre  pIf youre wondering why oneToMany, thats because invoices are stored as individual line items.

Essentially what the following does, but without any codetypedefcodesp  precodetypedef void func typedef func funkyfunc  funkyfunc ptr codepre  pI tried the followingp  precodevoid  ptr codepre  pbut it gives an emundeclared identifieremerror for codeptrcode probably due to completely different parsing.

Negative 733 pIm trying to keep a global list of a particular base classs instances so that I can track them down by iterating through this global list at any time. p  pI believe the most proper way to address this is with an intrusive list.

Negative 733 pI have made half a program that does some major floating point math. Depending on the data it started with, it can generate very large arrays that describe line segments. The positions of these line segments are recorded using the Cartesian coordinate system with floating point numbers to record the X,Y,Z positions of each end of the line. I cant use X,Y,Z for both ends so I used X,Y,Z for the start, and Q,R,S for the end. So basically what I want to do, is flag all lines that are identical or flipped so that Q,R,S one line one is equal to X,Y,Z on line two and X,Y,Z on line one is equal to Q,R,S on line two. My current flagging technique is to set X to 1 because I know that none of the lines will ever end up with negative coordinates. I dont want to flag both lines, just all of them except for one. This is my current functionp  precodeint filterint lines  printfFiltering...n refline0 scanline1 whilereflineltlines              if segpointX[refline]  segpointQ[scanline] ampamp segpointY[refline]  segpointR[scanline] ampamp segpointZ[refline]  segpointS[scanline] ampamp segpointQ[refline]  segpointX[scanline] ampamp segpointR[refline]  segpointY[scanline] ampamp segpointS[refline]  segpointZ[scanline]            segpointX[refline]  segpointX[scanline] ampamp segpointY[refline]  segpointY[scanline] ampamp segpointZ[refline]  segpointZ[scanline] ampamp segpointQ[refline]  segpointQ[scanline] ampamp segpointR[refline]  segpointR[scanline] ampamp segpointS[refline]  segpointS[scanline]                              printfOrigional f  f  f  gtlt  f  f  fn,segpointX[refline],segpointY[refline],segpointZ[refline],segpointQ[refline],segpointR[refline],segpointS[refline]                 printfDuplicate f  f  f  gtlt  f  f  fnn,segpointX[scanline],segpointY[scanline],segpointZ[scanline],segpointQ[scanline],segpointR[scanline],segpointS[scanline]                 segpointX[scanline]1                        scanline          ifscanlinelines1                              refline                 scanlinerefline1                      return0  codepre  pI know how many lines I have, and that is what lines integer is. This code works exactly as it should, but its really slow compared to the rest of my program. I think there must be a way to do this faster, but Im not sure how. It really is a shame to have this function because it drags down the rest of my program which is incredibly fast considering its all floating point math. If there is no decent way of making this around 3x faster than it is, I might just have to live with messed up data and make the next function smart enough to ignore it. Flagging the bad lines now would extremely helpful however, because the next function is complex enough as it is without trying to compensate for duplicates in my data.p

Im reading through literature and Im modeling it as a flat RBAC rolebased access control loosely based on csrc.nist.govrbacsandhuferraiolokuhn00.pdfp  pI wanted to know if there are good opensource implementations of this that I can take a look at. My concerns here are not to look at the backend storage aspect of this, but more about design aspects for an access control system.p  pI know the UNIX model is a very good way to look at it but Im not sure if it can map to this system. I think the tricky part is to build it as a generic system which doesnt exactly have a lot of requirements.p

So if you had a picture of a face on the top of an image and   the rest of the image was blurred out because the picture was taken   with an extremely low aperture.

The problem seems to go away if I wait several minutes and upload a new file. I dont have root access to the web server but can use PHP.p  pHow do I proceed in finding the true cause of the problemp  pstrongUpdatestrong I found a workaround to rename my index.html to index.php and using PHP append a unique number to the JavaScript file URL. Like thisp  precodeltscript srctrafik.jsaltphp echo time gtgtltscriptgt codepre  pThis forces the browser to reload the file. However my original question still stands, as I havent found the cause and I dont know how to systematically approach the issue. Also it seems like an ugly solution to involve PHP just for this.p

Negative 733 pIm not a fulltime Javascript developer. We have a web app and one piece is to write out a small informational widget onto another domain. This literally is just a html table with some values written out into it. I have had to do this a couple of times over the past 8 years and I always end up doing it via a script that just document.writes out the table.p  pFor examplep  precodedocument.writelttable border1gtlttrgtlttdgthere is some contentlttdgtlttrgtlttablegt codepre  pon theirdomain.comp  precodeltbodygt .... ltscript srchttpourdomain.comarcv1apiinventory1 typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt ..... ltbodygt codepre  pI always think this is a bit ugly but it works fine and we always have control over the content or a trusted representative has control such as like your current inventory or something. So another project like this came up and I coded it up in like 5 minutes using document.write. Somebody else thinks this is just too ugly but I dont see what the problem is. Re the widget aspect, I have also done iframe and jsonp implementations but iframe tends not to play well with other sites css and jsonp tends to just be too much. Is there a some security element Im missing Or is what Im doing ok What would be the strongest argument against using this technique Is there a best practice I dont getp

Negative 733 pI have a large series of numbers, in an array, about 150MB of numbers, and I need to find consecutive sequences of numbers, the sequences might be from 3 to 160 numbers. so to make it simple, I decided the each thread should start such as ThreadID  CellIDp  pSo thread0 looks at cell0, and if the number in cell0 matches my sequence, then, thread0  cell1 and so on, and if the numbed does not match, the thread is stopped and I do that for my 20000 threads. p  pSo that works out, fine but I wanted to know how to reuse threads, because the array in which im looking for the series of number is much bigger. p  pSo should I divide my array in smaller arrays, and load them into shared memory, and loop over the number of smaller arrays and eventually pad the last one. Or should I keep the big array in global memory, and have my thread to be to ThreadID  cellID and then ThreadID  cellID20000 etc. or is there a better way to go through.  p  pemTo clarifyem  At the moment i use 20 000 threads, 1 Array of numbers in Global Memory 150MB, and a sequence of numbers in shared memory eg 1,2,3,4,5, represented as an array. Thread0 start at Cell0, and look if the cell0 in global memory, is equal to cell0 in shared memory, if yes, thread0 compare cell1 in global memory, to cell1 in shared memory, and so on until there is a full match. p  pIf the numbers in both global and shared memory cells are not equal, that thread is simply discarded. Since, most of the numbers in the Global memory Array will not match the first number of my sequence. I thought it was a good idea to use one thread to match CellN in GM to CellN in ShM and overlap the threads.  and this technique allows coalesced memory access the first time, since every thread from 0 to 19 999 will access contiguous memory. p  pBut what I would like to know, is what would be the best way to reuse the threads that have been discarded, or the threads that finished to match. To be able to match the entire array of 150MB instead of simply match 20000 numbers  length of sequence 1. p

Negative 733 pI have done a few mobile apps using django as my backend, and now I am working on a chrome extension. I want my users to be able to send POST requests up to the server using the appextension but is there a way to do it without first asking the server for a CSRF token It just saves the app from making two requests every time we want to submit data. For example, I want to update my profile on my social media app or update a wallet from a chrome extension. It would be nice to open up the profile view input the data and push it to the server. Its less sleek if I have to open the profile, then wait for it to grab a token from the server and then I can submit the data. Is there another way to do this Or am I stuck making multiple requests every time I want to submit datap  pAlso, a little clarification, CSRF prevents sites from submitting forms with users data. But what is to stop me from making a site that uses ajax or something to grab the real site and steal the CSRF token and then paste that into my cross site request form I feel like there is a loophole here. I know that I am not quite understanding this all the way.p

I figured Id try codeCachedThreadPoolcode as an alternative, but it appears as the pool is then a single thread that runs pretty much at 100 throughout that entire while loop. A secondary thread for the pool is not created at any time during this process, and the other cores are pretty much idle as well. Whats really interesting is that the main worker thread which executes the rest of the stuff in the while loop is waiting practically all the time. p  pThis I find a bit peculiar, since Id expect at least two thread should be able to run at higher efficiency, one running the codeFragmentTaskcode and one running the rest of the stuff on the while loop, upto codefut.getcode.p  pAny ideas as to what could be going on behind the scenes Is the code too sequential for a thread pool to be usedp
Negative 733 ul lipProblemp  pSprings data binder allows you to set maximum size of automatically created codeListltgtcode e.g. to 3 items.

Negative 733   pI ask my question first.p  pstrongQuestionstrong I need binary and hex syntax for the codenumcode datatype. Is there some source somewhere I can easily adapt Can someone provide it for me Or, does it already existp  pThe numeral type class allows the use of binary and hexadecimal notation, such as code0b0101code and code0xAAcode. However, codenumcode is not instantiated as codenumeralcode, and I only see the constructors used directly, such as with this sourcep  precodeprimrec sqr  num gt num where   sqr One  One    sqr Bit0 n  Bit0 Bit0 sqr n    sqr Bit1 n  Bit1 Bit0 sqr n  n codepre  pBelow, I include a complete theory in which Ive defined notation to allow me to use binary and hex notation with codenumcode, but its not standard notation. The notation I have is acceptable, but it looks like it could eventually cause some conflicts.p  pI was initially building tables to learn how codeOnecode, codeBit0code, and codeBit1code are used to create a binary number. It was tricky at first, because the order of bits is reversed from normal, along with a few other quirks, but I finally got it. For anyone interested, there are some things that are good to know about codenumcode, along with a a hrefhttpsisabelle.in.tum.decommunityNumerals relnofollownumeral wiki pageap  ul liThe most significant digit is on the right, not on the left.li liThe codenumcode type has no zero, so the rightmost digit will always be 1, though the rightmost digit increases in value by powers of 2 when you add enough digits on the left.li liAdding zeros on the left makes a number bigger. li ul  pThe included theory is too involved to convert it to ASCII. Some might be interested in loading it in the PIDE to look at it. I show a use for the notation at the bottom, where I define the function codenumleftshiftcode.p  pIm just looking for syntax that has a 2 character prefix, like code0u1010101code, along with hex syntax like code0m555code. The translation of the syntax would build up a number from the codenumcode constructors.p  pI couldnt get codetranslationscode to work for me. I also see the use of codeparsetranslationcode in Num.thy, but I dont know how to use it.p  h2Update 140326h2  pI update this to answer Brian Huffmans question. I do it here since it will take more characters than a comment allows. Brians question is thisp  blockquote   pIs there a reason why you need to use type num directly Why not define a separate type of naturals  0, and make it an instance of class numeralp blockquote  pThe short answer is that I dont need codenumcode because it has no zero, I need it because thats the only way I know of to use codefuncode with binary and hex at the bit level. In particular, Im talking about pattern matching with codefuncode, on binary and hex patterns.p  pFrom here, I talk about how codenumcode is part of my grand scheme, and why I think I need it to do a binary bit shift.p  h2Numeral for abstraction, nat for Suc, and num for One, Bit0, and Bit1h2  pThis is related to my plans to eventually try and do a lot of work in algebra type classes.p  pTake the type class codelinorderedidomcode. How do I fully exploit the power of HOL for that type class I dont, because I dont have a constructor to work with.p  pI spent a number of days trying to use codedatatypecode and codetypedefcode to put a constructor on codeUNIValinorderedidom setcode, though it also involved zero having its own constructor.p  pIt sort of worked, but it was a bunch of clutter, and not a completely good solution.p  pThat led to my idea to use codenatcode as a means to front all numbers, using codenumeralnumofnatcode.p  pAs part of that I defined a function to calculate the number of digits in a decimal numberp  precodefun decdigits  nat gt nat where   decdigits n  if n div 10  0 then 1 else 1  decdigitsn div 10 codepre  pI assume that a bit shift operation on a binary number is faster than codedivcode, so I started pursuing a binary bit shift function to use with binary and hex numbers, and that led to codenumcode.p  pThis ties back into the section title above. With codenatcode, I get a constructor for building numbers by adding one. But how do I do binary bit shifts using codenatcode p  pTheres a lot I dont know about codenumeralcode and codenumcode, but my conclusion is that as a complete solution for working with numbers, I need to work with all three of codenumeralcode, codenumcode, and codenatcode.p  h2The left bit shift for binary and hex divisionh2  pThe function codenumleftshiftcode is part of the culmination of my preliminary effort to get some basic ideas settled for the future, in relation to number systems, and their relation to algebraic type classes.p  pThe type codenatcode is foundational to HOL, and codefuncode works a lot of magic with it. The codenumeralcode type class gives me an abstract set of number constants, where you work a lot of lowlevel magic for it with the algebraic binary operations.p  pBut how do I manipulate numbers based on their structure I know theres a lot of math in HOL, like codedivcode and codemodcode, but how do I do binary bit shifts without using codenumcodep  pAll I know right now is how to use codenumcode to do that for binary and hex. If theres a high level way to do that, Ill be happy to learn about it. p  pOne question I still have is this, How do I manipulate numbers in HOL based on decimal digits, without using codedivcodep  precode theory i140326anumbinhexnotation imports ComplexMain  begin  NOTE 1 The binary and hex notation for num cant prevent fun from directly     using the num constructors.

Negative 733 pI wrote a C win32 utility to read the title of open windows of a particular process. The intention is to check if that particular process is active, and if active determine which file is open in it.

I noticed that it still shows the full path as a tool tip if I move the mouse over to the title area.

Negative 733 pI have a website sending out email alerts when a story is posted. Customers subscribe to taxonomy terms to receive only the stories they are interested in. Im fighting with a weird issue  some of our subscribers complain that they get duplicate emails, Ive checked smtp logs and they are right. The problem has first happened with the Messaging and Notifications after 4 years of stable work, at first only a few users were getting duplicates for some emails and in the end every user was getting every email twice. I assumed it was connected with those modules and replaced them with Subscriptions. Now the problem occurs again. I have two questionsp  p1 Has anyone got an idea where I should look Im really lost. Im using Mandrill mandrillapp.com as SMTP server and used PHPMailer for connection in Drupal just replaced it with SMTP, hope it helps, will know tomorrow. The website has been hosted with Omega8.cc since the beginning of the year, and the problem occured after this update a hrefhttpsomega8.ccboa221fulledition305 relnofollowhttpsomega8.ccboa221fulledition305a but the tech support say its not connected with my issue and they cant help. p  p2 Ive looked at the subscriptionsqueue table and see the sqid column, which is the only one that seems to be related to nodes  how do I find which sqid links to which node I hope to run a filter on the table to remove duplicate entries if they are there.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated, Im really lost Thanks in advancep

Negative 733 pI started digging into RDFa recently and try to spice my website with semantic information. The site offers services, events, a blog and may offer products in future. Happily schema.org has coarse but adequate categories for it all. But now it comes to practical questions.p  pAll the examples have all information on a single page, which seems pretty academic to me. E.g. on my landing page is a list with upcoming events. Events have a location property. My events run at 2 different locations. I could paste the location information for each entry in  and inflate my html. Id rather link to pages, which describe the locations and hold full details. Not sure, whether this is what sameAs is for. But even then, how would it know which RDFa information on the target URL should be used as the appropriate vCardp  pSimilarly, my landing page has only partial company information visible. I could add a lot of codeltmetagtcode, but again a reference to the contact page would be nice.p  pI just dont want to believe that this aspect slipped the RDF creators. Are there any best practices for redundancy reductionp

Negative 733 pThe issue that Im running into is that when a user takes a photo with our app, using codeAVCaptureSessioncode, I have no way of determining whether they took the photo in Portrait or Landscape mode.

The only way to set the background to a gradient in this case is to define a style sheet like that and to set it as the tree views style sheetp  precodeQTreeViewitemhover  background qlineargradientx1 0, y1 0, x2 0, y2 1, stop 0 rgb255, 255, 255, stop 1 rgb 0, 255, 255 border 1px solid rgb 0, 255, 255  codepre  pThis works.p  pThere are situations where I would like to mark tree items the same way, even when the mouse is not placed over this tree item there is a 3D view and some items of the 3D view correspondent to tree items  I would like to highlight the tree view items, when the user points on those items in the 3D view.p  pThis is also possible. I the data method of the document tree model, I return a brush that I have created like thisp  precodeQLinearGradient gradient0, 0, 0, 1 gradient.setColorAt0, QColor255, 255, 255 gradient.setColorAt1, QColor0, 255, 255 QBrush brushgradient codepre  pThis also works. The only problem is, that the gradient defined with the brush is much different from the gradient defined with the style sheet, even though the numbers are the same actually in this example the complete background is white  but when I play with the numbers I realize that it is indeed a gradient, but not the one I had expected.p  pCould someone explain me the reasonp  pI thought that this could be the case because the QLinearGradient interprets the x1, x2, y1, y2 value as pixels. Does the style sheet interpret these values as relative values I have played around with the coordinate mode of the gradient, but this did not help.p  pHow can I make both gradients look the same Or should I get rid of those style sheets and define everything with QBrushsp  pAnother question my impression is, that those Qt stylesheets are not really wellthoughtout. Is this just because I dont know yet how to use them or is this really the casep  pI will try to make the problem clearer by adding some screen shots I should have done that immediately. The coordinate mode of the following QLinearGradient instances has been set to QGradientObjectBoundingModep  pThis is the tree item with the gradient defined by the style sheet img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8UcPx.png altThis is the tree item with the gradient defined by the style sheet.p  pThis is the tree item with the gradient defined by the QBrush with a QLinearGradient0, 0, 0, 1 img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcNEBK.png altThis is the tree item with the gradient defined by the QBrush with a QLinearGradient0, 0, 0, 1p  pThis is the tree item with the gradient defined by the QBrush with a QLinearGradient0, 0, 1, 1 img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeW1h7.png altThis is the tree item with the gradient defined by the QBrush with a QLinearGradient0, 0, 1, 1p  pMy problem is neither of the QBrushQLinearGradient combinations looks like the gradient defined by the style sheet.

Negative 733 pstrongEDITstrong I took the ifelse case as an example that can sometimes be resolved at compile time eg when static values are involved, cf codelttypetraitsgtcode. Adapting the answers below to other types of static branching eg, multiple branches or multicriteria branches should be straightforward. Note that compiletime branching using templatemeta programming is not the topic here.p  hr  pIn a typical code like thisp  precodeinclude lttypetraitsgt  template ltclass Tgt T numericprocedure const Tamp x       if  stdisintegralltTgtvalue                Integral types          else               Floating point numeric types       codepre  pwill the compiler optimize the ifelse statement out when I define specific template types later on in my codep  pA simple alternative would be to write something like thisp  precodeinclude lttypetraitsgt  template ltclass Tgt inline T numericprocedure const Tamp x       return numericprocedureimpl x, stdisintegralltTgt       template ltclass Tgt T numericprocedureimpl const Tamp x, stdtruetype const        Integral types   template ltclass Tgt T numericprocedureimpl const Tamp x, stdfalsetype const        Floating point numeric types  codepre  pIs there a difference in terms of performance between these solutions Is there any nonsubjective grounds for saying that one is better than the other Are there other possibly better solutions to deal with compiletime branchingp

Negative 733 pI made an invoice that has a listview on the bottom to list all of the line items. This can run over the one page mark so I overloaded the  DocumentPaginator  class to allow for me to print multiple pages. However, sometimes it cuts the page in the middle of a line of the listview. I found an article that uses a bitmap of the wpf control, then checks the color of pixels of a line to determine if there is whitespace or data code below. When I make my control into a bitmap though, the spacing and line height is different than when I print the wpf control as an xps or to the printer.

Negative 733 pI have an algorithm written in Java, in which I need to make sure a function call is not repeated if it has already been made. Let me explain the logicp  ol lipThere is a set of functions available function 1, function 2, ..., function n with their parameters,pli lipA function 1 call is made with a set of values as parameters and produces a result,pli lipThe function 1 call, the values passed as parameters, and the result produced are stored in memory,pli lipWhen a function 2 call is made, the function 2 call, its values passed as parameters and the result are stored in memory, pli lipWhen a function 1 call is made again, with different values as parameter, the new call thats it, its values and result is stored in memory,pli lipNow, when a function 1 call is made again, with the same values as parameters as in 2 above, since the exact same call has been previously made, we dont want to execute again the function call but we need to retrieve the result that was stored in 2 above.pli ol  pOur current strategy is to store in a map the function calls, their values and their results. For each new function call, we look in the map first if that function has been called already. If so, we compare one by one the values passed in the function call with the ones of previous function calls stored in memory. p  pAs the number of function calls grows, we have some performance issue. For each new call, we compare each values with the stored values in memory. So when weve called 100,000 times function 1 with different values each time and I call function 1 again with values A, B, C that have never been used previously, I need to compare 100,000 times A, B and C with the stored values of the 100,000 previous function calls. And then there is another call, I compare again 100,001 times. p  pPerformance gets worse to a point where it is very very slow. Would you have some hints on how to improve that algorithm pleasep

Negative 733 pI have been struggling with this question and cannot seem to find a clean answer for. I am using social login in an app I am writing my first. After the app launch, the user gets authenticated with his choice of a social network, in particular, Facebook.  when a user suspends the IOS app for days, and returns to it, the app returns right where the user left off, away from the initial login mechanism and the login viewController. How and where do you attempt to verify if the user Facebook token changed due to password change or expired from what I understand you have to make a social graph api request, but does that mean I have to implement this request in every viewController in my app I am under the impression that when the app becomes active it will only load the viewController displayed before the suspension. Maybe I am wrong. your input is greatly appreciated. Regardsp

It reports the image as the correct size but displays it much smaller so i originally thought it was an svg viewbox issue or something in this regard however i have tried changing the viewbox and preserveAspectRatio values with no effect. Plus the svg displays correctly initially so it doesnt make sense that there would be a problem with the actual svg files.p  pI want to avoid having to to edit the svg files manually if at all possible as it will make it much more difficult for normal users adding SVGs but i dont think they are the problem anyway.p  pCan anyone shed any light on why on earth this is happening and how to fix it as its a very strange issue p  pFYI there is another thread at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21536937svgresizesonhoverinsafarionlySVG resizes on hover in safari onlya which covers a similar topic but with no answers or links to reported bugs.p  pThanks so muchp  precodeltdiv idcontainergt     ltimg srchttpsdl.dropboxusercontent.coms3o4xrlvax9b08u4svghover.svg classsvghovergt ltdivgt  container   width 100 backgroundcolor 000000    img  width 100px height 100px   document.on mouseenter function       var t  this     t.attrsrc, functionindex, attr         var src  t.attrsrc         return attr.replacesrc, httpsdl.dropboxusercontent.comsrga8anccnpyublhsvg.svg      , mouseleave function       var t  this     t.attrsrc, functionindex, attr         var src  t.attrsrc         return attr.replacesrc, httpsdl.dropboxusercontent.coms3o4xrlvax9b08u4svghover.svg       , img.svghover codepre

Negative 733 pSupposing you have a html form with a small amount of backend php. The form has only one field, which returns either 1 or 0. For instance...p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comylrpI.png altenter image description herep  pAnd the php script records this in a MySQL database along with the information about the users OS.p  pSo you might find that lots of Windows8 users like waffles, but no so much Linux Mint users.p  pOh... 87 of windows 8 users said yes... thats something I guess. p  pBut the classes namely, in this case, the OS type strongarentstrong really known in advance by the developer. As such, the actual MySql table is a messy conglomeration of response yes or no along with the OS type possibly bound to a primary key which is an autoincrementing integer. To make life easier there is a separate attribute for yes and no so that every time a user says yes is recorded separately from when they say no. The data may look something likep  pemID  OStype  YES  NOemp  ol liWindows 7  1  NULL.li liWindows 8  NULL  1li liWindows 7  NULL  1li liJellybean  1  NULLli liWindows 8  NULL  1li liUbunto  1  NULLli liIphone 4  1  NULLli liWindows 7 NULL  1li liJellybean  1  NULL li ol  pand so onp  pSo the problem comes when trying to automatically get some sort of coherent detail from this dataset. You cant simply make an associative array based on a keyvalue pair of OSresponse because there are many duplicate OS keys. Really an associative array of unique keys has to be created that will not lose the critical data that in its creation, the count of the number of yeses and nos will be attached as values to the respective keys. How might one go about making such an associate arrayp

Im using Xcode 6.1 in my iOS 8 app with an included extension. The app and the extension both rely on an included framework. When I try to submit the app to the Store, the validation warning I get is codeERROR ITMS9000 Invalid bundle. The bundle at xxxxx.appex contains disallowed file Frameworks.codep  pI cant even find a file called Frameworks. The shared framework is supposed to be saved at LibraryFrameworks, which is Apples recommended save location. The project also uses Cocoapods, which strikes me as the only other possible culprit, since it has references in its configuration files to FRAMEWORKPATH though the build folder doesnt include a file or folder with that name.p

Negative 733 pI am looking for a way to have a separate layer of business logic in a MVC4 app with Entity Framework, without having to inject my real or fake database context in it. Right now we have a fake and real database context that derives from codeIContextcode, a repository codeRepositorycode and a controller codeMyControllercode.

These methods will need information obtained from the data access layer codeRepositorycode as well.p  pIt feels a bit strange to also inject the codeIContextcode for the codeRepositorycode in this business logic layer with the above pattern. E.g., p  precodeBusinessLogicIContext db        repo  new Repositorydb  codepre  pI see two ways to avoid this problemp  ol liCall the repository in the controllers and use data obtained as parameters to methods in the business logic layer.li liInject anyway.li ol  pI am looking for a good idea to set up the business logic layer in relation to data access and provide unit testability, preferably without having to inject the database context in every class.p  pHope someone can provide me with some insights.

Negative 733 pI have a mysql table with 6 columns and thousands of rows. I want to add another column titled count of reports. To begin, it should be known that some rows in this table are identical. They are not exactly duplicates, but rather there is a separate instance of the same exact values. So what I would like to do is collapse all of the duplicate rows into one row and add the count of these so count of all of the duplicates plus original to the adjacent count of reports column. Any row in which there is only that row would therefore have an adjacent count of reports value of 1. How would I go about this. For the purpose of this query, my table name is company, database is companies, and the six initial column names are seller, one, two, three, four, and types. p  pThe following query gives the entire table, with six columns and about two thousand rows.p  precodeselect seller, IFNULLone,, IFNULLtwo,, IFNULLthree,,  IFNULLfour,, types from companies.company   order by seller, one, two, three, four, types codepre  pWhat would I add to thishow would I change it to count the duplicate rows of the table, remove them, and add the count to an adjacent columnp

Negative 733 pHopefully a simple answer. Im doing a simulation study, where I need to sample a random number of individuals, N, from a uniform distribution, U25,200, at each of a thousand or so replications. Code for one replication is shown belowp  precodeLET U  RANDUNIFORM LET N  ROUND25  200  25ampU. codepre  pI created both of these macro variables outside of a DATA step because I need to call the N variable repeatedly in subsequent DATA steps and DO loops in both SAS and IML.p  pThe problem is that every time I call N within a replication, it resamples U, which necessarily modifies N. Thus, N is not held constant within a replication. This issue is shown in the code below, where I first create N as a variable that is constant across individuals and sample predictor values for X for each individual using a DO loop. Note that the value in N is not the same as the total number of individuals, which is also a problem.p  precodeDATA ID      N  ampN.     DO PersonID  1 TO ampN.

By holding U constant, N will necessarily be held constant.p  pIs there a way to do this using macro variablesp

Negative 733 pIm trying to understand the difference between why you can do an OPENcall in fortran on NFSv3 in readwrite mode on a file that you only have readpermissions on, while if you do the same thing on NFSv4 the OPENcall will fail. p  pLet me explain, below is a simple fortranprogram that opens given file argument to the program in readwrite mode, p  precodePROGRAM testopen   IMPLICIT NONE    Parameters   INTEGER,            PARAMETER  lunin  10  CHARACTERLEN100  fname    Local   INTEGER  i,ierr,siteid,nstation  REAL  lat, lon, asl  CHARACTERlen15  name        Open input file     CALL getarg1,fname   OPENlunin,filefname,STATUSOLD,IOSTATierr   IF  ierr  0  THEN     WRITE6,Could not open ,TRIMfname,ierr     STOP  ENDIF   WRITE6,Opened OK   CLOSElunin   END PROGRAM testopen codepre  pSave the above in testopen.f90 and compile with, p  precodegfortran o fortran testopen.f90  codepre  pNow, execute the following on a mountpoint with NFSv3, p  precodestrace eopen .fortran filewithonlyreadpermissions  codepre  pAnd you should see the following lines along with a lot of other output, p  precodegt openfilewithonlyreadpermissions, ORDWR   1 EACCES Permission denied gt openfilewithonlyreadpermissions, ORDONLY  3 codepre  pSo, we can clearly see that we get an EACCES Permission denied while trying to open in ORDWR open readwrite, embutem right after we see another open ORDONLY open readonly and that succeeds. p  pRun the same program on a file on a NFSv4 share, and we get the following, p  precodestrace eopen .fortran filewithonlyreadpermissionsonnfsv4share  gt openfilewithonlyreadpermissionsonnfsv4share, ORDWR   1 EPERM Operation not permitted  codepre  pSo, here we get an EPERM Operation not permitted while trying to open the file in ORDWR open readwrite and nothing more ie application fails. p  pDoing the same tests in C with a small testprogram it will fail to open the file in both scenarios that is, it will not try to open the file in readonlymode after getting the EACCES on NFSv3. p  pSo to the questions, p  ul lipI assume the above behaviour is due to the implementation of the OPENcall in fortran, and that if fortran gets an EACCES Permission denied while trying to open a file, it will automatically try to open the file in readonly ORDONLY. Is this assumption correct  pli lipI also assume that fortran doesnt have this fallbackmethod when getting an EPERM Operation not permitted while trying to open a file. Is this assumption correct, or am I missing something  pli lipC doesnt seem to implement a fallbackmethod in either a EACCES nor EPERM. This seems correct to me, since this doesnt leave any room for confusion. If you try to open a file in a way that you do not have the permissions to do, the program should fail  my opinion.  pli lipI am aware of that there is a distinct difference between Permission denied and Operation not permitted. And I guess that when mounting NFSv4 over kerberos there is a reason for getting Permission denied instead of Operation not permitted, however some clarification regarding this area would be great. pli ul  pOf course, adding the appropriate flags to the opencall ACTIONREAD solves the problem. Im just curios about my assumptions and if they are correct.p

Negative 733 pSo, I have web page that opens another page browser tab as a child to the first.  The parent tab holds the code that performs the bulk of the applications work.  The child tab holds a component that is normally embedded in the parent tab, but sometimes the user may want to open it in its own tab.  So they can.p  pThe problem is, the component in the child tab supports about 20 different keyboard commands and a number of mouse related commands as combos with keyboard commands.  I was trying to avoid remapping each keyboard command in the child window to a call in the parent window.  Right now, in the parent window, I use a plugin to map and handle keyboard commands that all get sent to the right component API call.p  pWhat I emwantem to do, is to just pipe keyboard and mouse events from the child window back to the parent, so that the regular handling of those events can proceed as normal.  I dont want to have to setup specific handlers for every command all over again in the child window.  Piping the keymouse events feels more elegant, and would, ideally, take less code.p  pThe first thing I tried, is thisp  precode CHILD WINDOW window.document.addEventListenerkeydown,  Redispatch, false function Redispatchevent           window.opener.myRedirector.dispatchChildEventevent   codepre  pAnd in the parent window, it had thisp  precodemyRedirector.dispatchChildEvent  functionevent     var r  dispatchEvente     console.logdispatched event from child window  codepre  pIn this case, nothing happens.  The strongconsole.logstrong function in the parent window never fires, and stepping through it, the strongconsole.logstrong line never gets hit.  The strongdispatchEventestrong call behaves as though an error occurs, but nothing is thrown this is the latest Chrome.p  pSo I tried instantiating a new event in the parent like this seen from another StackOverflow postp  precodemyRedirector.dispatchChildEvent  functione     var event   document.createEventKeyboardEvent     var method  typeof event.initKeyboardEvent  undefined  initKeyboardEvent  initKeyEvent      event[method]          type          e.type,          bubbles       true,          cancelable    false,          view          window,          keyIdentifier e.keyIdentifier,          keyLocation   e.location,          ctrlKey       e.ctrlKey,          altKey        e.altKey,          shiftKey      e.shiftKey,          metaKey       e.metaKey,          altGraphKey   false     codepre  pThe problem here is that this doesnt initialize all the properties of the event, like strongkeyCodestrong and strongwhichstrong.  The keyboard handler plugin I am using doesnt read strongkeyIdentifierstrong, it uses strongkeyCodestrong.  I cant manually set strongkeyCodestrong cause its readonly on the object.  I thought of changing the plugin to read the strongkeyIdentifierstrong, but that value isnt an integer, its a Unicode string like U005, etc, and I dont want to remap all the keyCodes to those values in the plugin though this may be Chrome specific.p  pSo I also tried instantiating a CustomEvent, and just adding properties to it, which emalmostem worked. Except CustomEvent has a strongtypestrong property that is set to empty string, and cant be overridden, so the plugin doesnt catch it since its not of type keydown, etc.p  pI keep feeling like Im missing something that should make this possible.  Thats why Ive avoided other solutions like remapping values, or setting up all new handlers in the child window, etc.  p  pIt emfeelsem like it should be possible to just pipe keyboardmouse events to a parent window.  So far, though, I cant seem to find a way.p  pAny suggestions, or solutionsp

Negative 733 pA console application .exefile is, basically, an action that takes a number of string parameters command line arguments, presented to Main as a string array and does some stuff.p  pAn Action or Action is an action that takes a number of string parameters and does some stuff.p  pIf I have an .exefile, its quite simple to create an Actionobject from it, like thisp  precodeActionltString[]gt a  args gt ltstart external process, using args as argumentsgt codepre  pBut is there a way to go the other way, that is, if I have an Action object, can I make a console application .exefile from it Preferably as selfcontained as possible that is, an .exefile containing all the code encapsulated by the Actionobject, without relying on my original .exefile, .dllfiles etc.p  pEdit To clarify a bit My application is a machine learning classification application, which reads some input, processes them in some way, resulting in some classifier e.g., a neural network with trained weights. Now Id like to output the resulting classifier the neural network, or whatever into a standalone exefile, which will be used later for testing or demonstration. My solution so far is to output the classifier object to a file using, for the time being, a binary serialization, and then have a different console application that can read this file and use it to classify new data.p  pHowever, the problem with this approach apart from being a bit cumbersome, since I have to distribute both the exefile and the classifier file, is that it is fragile. This is a research project, and the classifier code changes a lot. Therefore, if I have a classifier file created from my NeuralNetworkClassifier class say last week, it may not work next week, since the NeuralNetworkClassifier class or other classes it depends on may have changed. Therefore, a selfcontained .exefile, which contains all the neural network code, in addition to the learned weight values, would make our system a lot more robust.p

Negative 733 pI have some very disk intensive cluster jobs that Id like to process in the tmp space on each compute node. The jobs are submitted to a grid engine and then distributed to any number of nodes, each node has a large local tmp directory. The nodes are all CentOS, and share a common NFS mount.p  pFor each job, Id like to be able to copy all the data from its NFS location to the tmp directory, do the processing, and copy it back out to its original NFS location. However, the processing stream is generic, meaning any command line programs could be launched as part of a job. Some of the programs we run, like MATLAB, like to expand soft links to the actual path and also store full paths in the processed data.p  pIve only thought of one way to do this, but I wanted to see if there is a better way.p  p1 Create a link from the NFS directory to tmpblahthelocaljobstempdir, so that all references to that directory are directed to the tmp. Then after processing is done, move the tmp directory to its final location and remove the link. This may work for some jobs, but not those that expand their paths andor store full paths in the data.p  pBasically, how can I make a program think it is working in one path, when its actually working in a different path, without using hard links since the directories are on different filesystemsp
Negative 733 pFor an assignment, Im trying to write a method that searches through one of several ArrayLists each containing different collections of objects and returning the object that has a matching name field to that specified. I can do so by implementing a function that searches over a preset arraylist content of one kind of object like sop  precodepublic static Data findContentString name          for int i  0 i lt content.size i               if name.equalscontent.geti.name                  return content.geti                               return null      codepre  pAnd returns the first object with the matching name field or null if one could not be found. I want to use generic types to have one method that can search over several different lists of different objects Where each object in each list will have a name field. How would I go about doing sop  pThanks in advancep

Negative 733 pThis is probably a newbie question, as Im quite new to ASP.NET MVC 5.

Negative 733 pContext I am using an codeUICollectionViewcode for a photoview. Every picture is a cell with one codeUIImagecode. Images can have different sizes and I want them to fill the whole screen. So I wrote a class who determines the frame of every single codeUICollectionCellcode and let a subclass of codeUICollectionViewFlowLayoutcode ask that class for the right frame for every item.p  pMy implementation of the codeUICollectionViewFlowLayoutClasscodep  precodeoverride func layoutAttributesForElementsInRectrect CGRect gt [AnyObject]      let attributesToReturn  super.layoutAttributesForElementsInRectrect as [UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes]     for attributes in attributesToReturn  []          if attributes.representedElementCategory  .Cell              let frame  self.layoutAttributesForItemAtIndexPathattributes.indexPath.frame             attributes.size  frame.size             attributes.frame  frame                   return attributesToReturn   override func layoutAttributesForItemAtIndexPathindexPath NSIndexPath gt UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes      let curAttributes  super.layoutAttributesForItemAtIndexPathindexPath     let frame  mazeManager.sizeForItemAtIndexindexPath, collectionView collectionView     curAttributes.size  frame.size     curAttributes.frame  frame     return curAttributes  codepre  pSo the frame asks my MazeManager to give back a frame. The returned frames seem to be correct and they all fit in the UICollectionView.p  pWhen I open my app everything looks fine, even when I scroll. But when I scroll to a specific position this position feels random because it depends on the images I test with, but with the same set of images the positions are the same cells disappear from my view. When I scroll back they return.p  pIve checked if the cells where not hidden, but they never are.p  pOn some other threads with similar issues the answer is to implement the codecollectionViewContentSizecode so I didp  precodeoverride func collectionViewContentSize gt CGSize      let size  mazeManager.collectionViewContentSize     return size.height lt collectionView.frame.size.height  collectionView.frame.size  size  codepre  pThe number of items is not static and it grows while reaching the end of the view. So what happens here is The manager determines the Origin.y  the Size.Height of the last item  10 points to be sure, the width is the width of the UICollectionView.p  pStill all the frames of the cells are within the sizes returned by this method. But still some cell disappear or never appear at all.p  pWhen I scroll further through the UICollectionView I see other cells which are positioned on the right place. So there are gaps in my view, but the flow continues. When a gap appears there are no calls for the items at the missing idexpaths in the collectionViewDelegate. For example the CollectionView asks for items 1,2,3,4,5,6, 12,13,14.p  pThe console prints nothing about wrong positioning, Ive checked and everything is within the ContentSize. So Im almost out of options. Can anybody explain whats happening in my casep  pThank you.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pWhile I was looking for a solution, I already found the mentioned post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13360975uicollectionviewscelldisappearingUICollectionView39s cell disappearinga and I already did 3 of the 4 steps.p  precodeoverride func shouldInvalidateLayoutForBoundsChangenewBounds CGRect gt Bool      return true  codepre  pAnd I just added the scroll direction in the initializerp  precodeoverride init     super.init     scrollDirection  .Vertical   required initcoder aDecoder NSCoder      super.initcoder aDecoder     self.scrollDirection  .Vertical  codepre  pUnfortunately this doesnt fix my issue, so it doesnt seem a duplicate to me.p

Negative 733 pMy project use xfire as a web service client api. My project is in legacy ServletJSP. We used XFire eclipse plugin to generate client stub.p  pWebservice has Migrated to SLL HTTPS. Is there any easy way to consume Webservice over SSL in XFire.p  pI found some code at a hrefhttpdocs.codehaus.orgdisplayXFIREHTTPTransport relnofollowhttpdocs.codehaus.orgdisplayXFIREHTTPTransporta.  I have some confusion there too. It motivates to use codenotsocommonsslcode which is in Alpha and I dont know if it is stable enough to be used in production.p  precode Technique similar to httpjuliusdavies.cacommons    sslTrustExample.java.html HttpSecureProtocol protocolSocketFactory  new HttpSecureProtocol   thecertificate.cer can be PEM or DER raw ASN.1.  Can even be several PEM certificates in one file.

Negative 733 pI am trying to move away from using md5 for storing and comparing passwords. So I want to start using passwordhash.p  pNow, how I used to do it, was I would store the username and an md5 of their password in their session or cookies if they chose remember me, and then check the database to see if any user existed with that username and md5d password. I realize this is not very secure, which is why I want to stop this.p  pI can no longer do this because passwordhash always changes, so I cannot store a hash in their session and then check for it in the database, because I need to use passwordverify on the unhashed password.p  pSo my question is, if I store a hashed session id and token in the user table when a user successfully logs in, and then store that in the persons sessioncookies along with the user id in order to check the database with, is this secure enough When I say hashed session id and token I mean sha256d or even md5d hash of random large numbers...p  pExamplep  pUser logs in  hashed session id and token is store in the users cookiessession, and their row in the database is updated with the hashed session id and token.p  pUser visits site  code checks to see if their session id and token exists in the database based on their browser sessioncookie vars. If it does, it assumes that the row found represents the current user.p  pAny insight would be greatly appreciated.p

Then go to another row and click its edit button.  Then come back to the row in which you changed one of the input field values, click edit, then click accept. You will find that the value you initially changed will get saved.p  pI believe that this will confuse the end user because when you initially changed the value, tht value DID NOT appear on the screen after you clicked on edit button of another row. The value shown on screen was still the original value.p  pSo, how do you go about fixing this issue p

Negative 733 pI am trying to implement a Zeroconf service browser using a PyGobject Gio.DBusProxy object to talk to avahi. It all works fine but the browser randomly misses the initial one or more ItemNew signals from the avahi server. It sometimes even misses the AllForNow signal. Subsequent ItemNew signals are seen OK as services come and go.p  pIt looks to me that I cannot connect the signal up quickly enough. I can only do it when the local proxy object has been created.

Negative 733 pI have an application which creates a collection in MongoDB for every user where a collection is expected to have at most 100,000 documents a few big users are like this while many small users only have less than 10,000 documents. Now the number of users grows and I want to shard my database. Is it possible to say put this collection thus this user on this shard and that collection on that shard, but do not shard documents inside a collection further, and is it possible to do this automaticallyp  pstrongEditstrong Im already aware of MongoDBs standard sharding design now, but my application was scaled up from a small application for single persons use, where a a hrefhttpsgithub.comlouischatriotnedb relnofollownedba datastore is created for the user. When the multiuser support was added, it was an obvious choice to create a nedb datastore for every user so many parts of my application could stay unchanged. When I migrated it to MongoDB, since one nedb datastore is the equivalent of a MongoDB collection, I was using one collection per user. Given the current situation, I wonder the quickest way  with the smallest change to my application and overall configurations to solve the current performance issue.p

Apparently, codewindow.requestAnimationFramecallbackcode in JavaScript basically just fires the given callback function when the browser is ready.

Whereas if the contents are updated after the callback has fired, then couldnt the browser utilize lowlevel, wholescreen doublebuffering functions to blit the updates seemingly at oncep

Negative 733 pI am trying to understand the paper ema hrefhttpwww.ipb.unibonn.deuploadstxikgpublicationbeder06.determining.pdf relnofollowDetermining an initial image pair for fixing the scale of a 3d reconstruction from an image sequenceaem by Beder and Steffen. They give a formula Eq. 8 for the covariance matrix of a triangulated point after stereo matching. However, when I implemented rather carefully, I think their method the matrix in question turned out to be nonsymmetric, which is a bit of a problem for a covariance matrix.p  pHas anyone implemented their method before and has insight on what is going on Perhaps I am missing something glaringly obviousp  pEDIT Even without implementing anything, formula 8 feels odd. The matrix N defined there simply cannot by symmetric, because is has AX in one place and XT in the corresponding place when transposed. How can AXX be true p

Ive also made a[nother] gist that just has the problem code and some sample data, but since this problem seems to throw around a bunch of state somehow, I cant guarantee itll be reproducible from it a hrefhttpsgist.github.compaultopia402891d05dd8c05995d2 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.compaultopia402891d05dd8c05995d2ap  pstrongEnd TLDR, begin messstrongp  pIm doing some toy textmining on that old enron dataset, and I have the following set of functions to clean up the emails preparatory to turning them into a document term matrix, after loading nltk stopwords and such.  The following uses the a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2libraryemail.html relnofollowemail librarya in python 2.7p  precodedef parseEmaildocument      strip unnecessary headers, header text, etc.     theMessage  email.messagefromstringdocument     tofield  theMessage[to]     fromfield  theMessage[from]     subjectfield  theMessage[subject]     bodyfield  theMessage.getpayload     wholeMsgList  [tofield, fromfield, subjectfield, bodyfield]      get rid of any fields that dont exist in the email     cleanMsgList  [x for x in wholeMsgList if x is not None]      now return a string with all that stuff run together     return  .joincleanMsgList  def lettersOnlydocument     return re.sub[azAZ],  , document  def wordBagdocument     return lettersOnlyparseEmaildocument.lower.split  def cleanDocdocument     dasbag  wordBagdocument      get rid of enron for obvious reasons, also the .com     bagB  [word for word in dasbag if not word in [enron,com]]     unstemmed [word for word in bagB if not word in stopwords.wordsenglish]     return [stemmer.stemword for word in unstemmed]  print enronEmails[0][1]  print cleanDocenronEmails[0][1] codepre  pFirst Tminus half an hour running this on an email represented as a unicode string produced the expected result codeprint cleanDocenronEmails[0][1]code yielded a list of stemmed words.  To be clear, the underlying data enronEmails is a list of [label, message] lists, where label is an integer 0 or 1, and message is a unicode string.  In python 2.7.p  pThen at t10, I added a couple lines of code since deleted and lost, unfortunately...but see below, with some list comprehensions in them to just extract the messages from the enronEmails, run my cleanup function on them, and then join them back into strings for convenient conversion into document term matrix via sklearn.  But the function started throwing errors.  So I put my debugging hat on...p  pFirst I tried rerunning the original definition and test cell.  But when I reran that cell, my email parsing function suddenly started throwing an error in the messagefromstring method p  precodeAttributeError list object has no attribute messagefromstring codepre  pSo that was bizarre.  This was exactly the same function, called on exactly the same data codecleanDocenronEmails[0][1]code.  The function was working, on the same data, and I havent changed it.  p  pSo checked to make extrasure I didnt mutate the data.  codeenronEmails[0][1]code was still a string.  Not a list.  I have no idea why traceback was of the opinion that I was passing a list to cleanDoc.  I wasnt.  p  pstrongBut the plot thickensstrongp  pSo then I went to a make a gist to create a wholly reproducible example for the purpose of posting this SO question.  I started with the working part.  The gist a hrefhttpsgist.github.compaultopiac8c3e066c39336e5f3c2 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.compaultopiac8c3e066c39336e5f3c2a.  p  pTo make sure it was working, first I stuck it in a normal .py file and ran it from command line.  It worked.  p  pThen I stuck it in a cell at the bottom of my ipython notebook with all the other stuff in it.  That worked too.p  pThen I tried the parseEmail function on codeenronEmails[0][1]code.  That emworked againem.  Then I went all the way back up to the original cell that was throwing an error not five minutes ago and reran it including the import from sklearn, and including the original definition of all functions.  strongAnd it freaking worked.strongp  pbBUT THENb I then went back in and tried again with the list comprehensions and such.  And this time, I kept track more carefully of what was going on.  Adding the following cells p  p1.p  precodedef atLeastThreeStringcleandoc     return  .join[w for w in cleandoc if lenwgt2] print atLeastThreeStringcleanDocenronEmails[0][1] codepre  pTHIS works, and produces the expected output a string with words over 2 letters.  But then  2.p  precodejustEmails  [email[1] for email in enronEmails] bigEmailsList  [atLeastThreeStringcleanDocemail for email in justEmails] codepre  pand all of a sudden it starts throwing a whole new error, same place in the traceback p  precodeAttributeError unicode object has no attribute messagefromstring codepre  pwhich is extra funny, because I was passing it unicode strings a minute ago and it was doing just fine.  And, just to thicken the plot, then going back and rerunning codecleanDocenronEmails[0][1]code emthrows the same erroremp  pThis is driving me insane.  How is it possible that creating a new list, and then attempting to run function A on that list, not only throws an error on the new list, but ALSO causes function A to throw an error on data that it was previously working on  I emknowem Im not mutating the original list... p  pIve posted the entire notebook in html form here, if anyone wants to see full code and traceback a hrefhttppaulgowder.comwtf.html relnofollowhttppaulgowder.comwtf.htmla  The relevant parts start about 23 of the way down, at the cells numbered 245, where it works, and then the cell numbered 26, where it blows up.  p  phelpp  pstrongAnother editstrong Ive added some more debugging efforts to the bottom of the abovelinked html notebook.  As you can see, Ive traced the problem down to the act of looping, whether done implicitly in list comprehension form or explicitly.  My function works on an individual item in the list of just emails, but then fails on every single item when I try to loop over that list, strongexceptstrong when I use map to do it.

The field must be protected or public. This allows us to say in the subclass codethis.balance  5code. My understanding of the principles is not the issue, my problem is with the question im asked to answer. From an implementation stand point, there is no flaw that I can clearly see in the PredatoryCreditCard.charge method as in both cases of the new implementation provided by the question, we are changing the balance field of the class regardless, because of the call to super. I cant find a flaw in the new implementation unless I think there is some hole in my knowledge of inheritance.p  pThank you in advance. p

Negative 733 pI am trying to create a form for our users to update account info.  I have a package built so that users can create custom lists to choose qualifications from to display on their profiles.  I have a partial view created for the custom lists that loops through all of the lists for that entity type to get which ones to display on the form.p  pThe problem im having is that the include only works when I put it in the sectioncontent area, but then the rest of the content from the including blade is not shown, only what is included.  If i put the include in its own section, it doesnt show.p  pHaving the include in the same section as the rest of my code like thisp  precodeextendslayout  sectioncontent ltformgt      ltlabelgtNameltLabelgt      ltinput typetext namefirstnamegt       ltlabelgtLast NameltLabelgt      ltinput typetext namelastnamegt       ltlabelgtEmailltLabelgt      ltinput typetext nameemailaddressgt ltformgt includePackagepath.to.partial endsection codepre  pResults in something likep  precodelthtmlgt      ltbodygt           ltdiv classcontainerfluidgt                ltPartial Package Codegt           ltdivgt      ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pIf I have the include in its own section, like below, only what is in the content section is displayedp  precodeextendslayout  sectioncontent ltformgt      ltlabelgtNameltLabelgt      ltinput typetext namefirstnamegt       ltlabelgtLast NameltLabelgt      ltinput typetext namelastnamegt       ltlabelgtEmailltLabelgt      ltinput typetext nameemailaddressgt ltformgt endsection sectioncustomlist      includePackagepath.to.partial endsection codepre  pResults in something likep  precodelthtmlgt      ltbodygt           ltdiv classcontainerfluidgt                  ltformgt                       ltlabelgtNameltLabelgt                       ltinput typetext namefirstnamegt                        ltlabelgtLast NameltLabelgt                       ltinput typetext namelastnamegt                        ltlabelgtEmailltLabelgt                       ltinput typetext nameemailaddressgt                  ltformgt           ltdivgt      ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 733 pSo heres my problem. I am currently trying to create a rectangular enclosure using four more rectangles as borders. So it would look somewhat like this. Keep in mind each side is individual so a rectangle with a border wouldnt work.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comftqcr.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comftqcr.png altenter image description hereap  pNow the actual problem comes with different screen sizes. Specifically the 4s. Since the screen is emshorterem than other phones, how would I resize the rectangles on the side to fit the height One of my options was detect the screen size, and then set the height of the rectangle, but I was wondering if there was an easier way since Id also have to deal with all the other screens. p
