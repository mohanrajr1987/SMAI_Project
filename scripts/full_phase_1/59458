Positive 59458 pI have four layouts in my page. I want to fill the centre layout with the components from the left layout by drag and drop.But after a component is dragged from left layout to centre layout I want a copy of dragged component to be filled in left layout, i.e. the left layout should have n number of components even though when a component is dragged and dropped the same component must be inserted in the placed of dragged component.Leaving same set of components after drag and drop. Or is it possible to send primefaces components as a list from bean to xhtml.p  h2xhtmlh2  precode ltplayout fullPagefalsegt                             ltplayoutUnit positioneast size200 headerRight gt                             ltplayoutUnit positionwest size300 headerLeft                                 closabletrue collapsibletruegt                                 lthformgt                                     ltpfieldset legendAvailableCarsgt                                         ltpdataGrid idavailableCars varcar valuesdsd                                             columns3gt                                             ltpcolumngt                                                 ltppanel idpnl headerDrop Down styletextaligncentergt                                                     ltptab titleLayoutgt                                                         ltbr gt                                                         lthoutputLabel forname valueStandard Label gt                                                         ltpinputText idname disabledtrue gt                                                         ltpdraggable forname gt                                                         ltbr gt                                                     ltptabgt                                                     ltptab titleRadio Buttongt                                                         ltpoutputLabel forconsole valueTypes gt                                                         ltpselectOneRadio idconsolegt                                                             ltfselectItem itemLabelXbox One itemValueXbox One gt                                                             ltfselectItem itemLabelPS4 itemValuePS4 gt                                                         ltpselectOneRadiogt                                                         ltpdraggable forconsole gt                                                     ltptabgt                                                     ltptab titleDrop Downgt                                                         ltpoutputLabel forcountry valueItems  gt                                                         ltpselectOneMenu idcountry stylewidth150px                                                             valuelist gt                                                         ltpdraggable forcountry gt                                                     ltptabgt                                                     ltptab titleImagegt                                                         ltpgraphicImage idpic valueimagesprometheus.jpg gt                                                         ltpdraggable forpic gt                                                     ltptabgt                                                     ltptab titleSavegt                                                         ltpcommandButton idlayoutSave valueSave gt                                                         ltpdraggable forlayoutSave gt                                                     ltptabgt                                                     ltptab titleCancelgt                                                         ltpcommandButton idlayoutCancel valueCancel gt                                                         ltpdraggable forlayoutCancel gt                                                     ltptabgt                                                 ltppanelgt                                                  ltpdraggable forpnl reverttrue                                                     handle.uipaneltitlebar stack.uipanel gt                                              ltpcolumngt                                         ltpdataGridgt                                     ltpfieldsetgt                                 lthformgt                              ltplayoutUnitgt                              ltplayoutUnit positioncenter gt                                 lthformgt                                     ltpfieldset idselectedCars stylewidth 800px height 800pxgt                                         ltpoutputPanel iddropAreagt                                             lthoutputText valueDrop here stylefontsize24px gt                                          ltpoutputPanelgt                                     ltpfieldsetgt                                     ltpdroppable forselectedCars tolerancetouch                                         activeStyleClassuistatehighlightgt                                         ltpajax listenerfundamentCreatorBean.dropped gt                                     ltpdroppablegt                                 lthformgt                             ltplayoutUnitgt                         ltplayoutgt codepre

Positive 59458 pI want to use STEAMLOGIN in my JSF2 web application. I found this in Steam Web API documentationp  pSteam can act as an OpenID provider. This allows your application to authenticate a users SteamID without requiring them to enter their Steam username or password on your site which would be a violation of the API Terms of Use. Just download an OpenID library for your language and platform of choice and use a hrefhttpsteamcommunity.comopenid relnofollowhttpsteamcommunity.comopenida as the provider. The returned Claimed ID will contain the users 64bit SteamID. The Claimed ID format is a hrefhttpsteamcommunity.comopenidid relnofollowhttpsteamcommunity.comopenididap  pHere are my questionsp  ul liThere are several OpenID libraries for Java, which one should I useli liI have no idea how to implement redirection to Steam login page and back to my pageli ul  pI found some examples for PHP but nothing for Java.p

Here are the steps to reproducep  ol liOpen a row for editingli lichange a value in the first column you can verify that the second column list has changed.li licancel the row editli liThe first column value does not revert to originalli ol  pI think it has something to do with the ajax call to the backing beans listener.

Positive 59458 pI have an hform in my page and have another page embedded using uiinsert. Im using foundation 5 and my page has a modal. Now this modal opens as I click a button on the page. I fill the content in this modal and the values dont go across to the bean session scoped cdi unless I add hform there in the modal. I understand this isnt valid in html, but I couldnt avoid doing this. So far no problems. Until now when I try to complete an action on the modal, after the action completes, it is supposed to close conditionallyif a certain list becomes empty. so I added a function in the onevent of ajax request, which closes the modal if data.status  success, checks for list empty condition and escapes to the main page and clicks a tab as it should from the javascript. The problem is, the model values get updated, even the form components I render using render attribute of fajax, are updated, meaning displaynone is applied to my buttons style, but the button remains on the page. This button is supposed to disappear, but it does not until I refresh the page. Also there are other components on the page which are supposed to disappear but dont until I click the button or refresh the page.p  pOne other scenario is that as I finish a save function from this modal from a button, it escapes to the main page and updates a list and other components on the page, on my local server. But when I commited this code to remote serverdevint env, things on the main page become unresponsive and freeze until a manual page refresh. No code difference between local and server.p  pTried clearing browser cache,p  ul li  li ul  pBut no use. I forced a form submit and button click through the javascript, which I shouldnt have to do, the form submit does it but I also do a click on a tab after that and that does not work.p  pI have looked for some solution on the web extensively but I cant seem to find any related post. Dont know what I am not doing. Any help will be much appreciated because right now Im superstuck here. p

All parts are written in C as exe  dlls, with the exception of the interface to the OOXML document. The latter component is a COM component that was created in C.NET. The main reason for this is that the .NET framework contains emSystem.IO.Packagingem.

Negative 59458 pIn an application I wrote a few years back I use function SystemParametersInfo with SPIGETPOWEROFFTIMEOUT to get the timeout for monitor off. On Vista this doesnt work anymore.p  pSo I decided to make this work on Vista, but after a few hours I feel like Im no closer to a solution.p  pMost of the functions I am going to mention are described on a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa373163VS.85.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa373163VS.85.aspxap  pTo my understanding I should 1. use function PowerGetActiveScheme, to get current scheme 2. use PowerEnumerate with GUIDVIDEOSUBGROUP 3. use PowerReadACValue or DC value to get the value.p  pIs this right Seems like a lot of work to get to one setting.

Negative 59458 pGreetings,p  pI have two questions regarding a DataTable.Select  p  p1 How to escape potential apostrophes or any other characters that would cause an issue.  Im not worried about SQL Injection. 2 How to use IN with Like, and include results that have a null.p  p1 Unfortunately, I cant seem to find any advice for the first option since every one says use parametrized is that a word queries which Im pretty sure you cant do with the Datatable.select.  The situation is like so, I dont know what the values are going to be ahead of time since the list is retrieved from a textbox.  US , Engineering , Lumburgs  I know I could parse the string before passing it to the select but Im sure there is some ANSI built in away of doing it which Im afraid I dont know.  Im aware that two apostrophes in a row would escape the character if I knew where it was going to be located but I dont know the exact location when I receive it.p  p2 Ok.  Now for the actual Select Expression.  What Im looking to do is allow the user to free form type into a text field.  This text field will use 4 different columns to filter by.  So the user could type in several items separated by space which would then perform a query per their criteria.  like the iTunes search box which allows you to type free form album song etc or you could be specific and only search by one type of item  p  pI know how to do an IN or a Like by themselves but Im not sure how I could put them together including escaping the apostrophes and including results that match but might have a null in one of the columns and of course do something that is supported by the .Select method.p  pWHERE  Country IN US , Engineering , Lumburgs WHERE  Country LIKE LUp  pSo the user in the case above provided LU which should return a record for Lumburg.  The more information they provide would further refine the results.  Any ideasp  pHere is the technical specs regarding my applicationp  pWinforms VB.NET  .Net 2.0p

Negative 59458 h1Question in nutshellh1  pWhat is the best way to get Python and Java to play nice with each otherp  h1More detailed explanationh1  pI have a somewhat complicated situation.  Ill try my best to explain both in pictures and words.  Heres the current system architecturep  pimg srchttpi50.tinypic.com2s6lutk.png altCurrent system architecturep  pWe have an agentbased modeling simulation written in Java.  It has options of either writing locally to CSV files, or remotely via a connection to a Java server to an a hrefhttpwww.hdfgroup.orgHDF5HDF5a file.  Each simulation run spits out over a gigabyte of data, and we run the simulation dozens of times.  We need to be able to aggregate over multiple runs of the same scenario with different random seeds in order to see some trends e.g. min, max, median, mean.  As you can imagine, trying to move around all these CSV files is a nightmare there are multiple files produced per run, and like I said some of them are enormous.  Thats the reason weve been trying to move towards an HDF5 solution, where all the data for a study is stored in one place, rather than scattered across dozens of plain text files.  Furthermore, since it is a binary file format, it should be able to get significant space savings as compared to uncompressed CSVS.p  pAs the diagram shows, the current postprocessing we do of the raw output data from simulation also takes place in Java, and reads in the CSV files produced by local output.  This postprocessing module uses JFreeChart to create some charts and graphs related to the simulation.p  h2 The Problem h2  pAs I alluded to earlier, the CSVs are really untenable and are not scaling well as we generate more and more data from simulation.  Furthermore, the postprocessing code is doing more than it should have to do, essentially performing the work of a very, very poor mans relational database making joins across tables csv files based on foreign keys the unique agent IDs.  It is also difficult in this system to visualize the data in other ways e.g. Prefuse, Processing, JMonkeyEngine getting some subset of the raw data to play with in MatLab or SPSS.p  h2 Solution h2  pMy group decided we really need a way of filtering and querying the data we have, as well as performing cross table joins.  Given this is a writeonce, readmany situation, we really dont need the overhead of a real relational database instead we just need some way to put a nicer front end on the HDF5 files.  I found a few papers about this, such as one describing how to use a hrefhttpwww.springerlink.comcontent8fudjp9enmkcgyr8XQuery as the query language on HDF5 filesa, but the paper describes having to write a compiler to convert from XQueryXPath into the native HDF5 calls, way beyond our needs. Enter a hrefhttpwww.pytables.orgmoinPyTablesa.  It seems to do exactly what we need provides two different ways of querying data, either through Python list comprehension or through a hrefhttpwww.pytables.orgdocsmanualch05.htmlinkernelSearchinkernel C level searchesa.p  pThe proposed architecture I envision is this img srchttpi46.tinypic.com9aseg3.png altEnvisioned architecturep  pWhat Im not really sure how to do is to link together the python code that will be written for querying, with the Java code that serves up the HDF5 files, and the Java code that does the post processing of the data.  Obviously I will want to rewrite much of the postprocessing code that is implicitly doing queries and instead let the excellent PyTables do this much more elegantly.p  h2 JavaPython optionsh2  pA simple google search turns up a few options for a hrefhttpwiki.cacr.caltech.edudanseindex.phpCommunication5Fbetween5FJava5Fand5FPythoncommunicating between Java and Pythona, but I am so new to the topic that Im looking for some actual expertise and criticism of the proposed architecture.  It seems like the Python process should be running on same machine as the Datahose so that the large .h5 files do not have to be transferred over the network, but rather the much smaller, filtered views of it would be transmitted to the clients.  a hrefhttppyro.sourceforge.netprojects.htmlPyroa seems to be an interesting choice  does anyone have experience with thatp

The JavaScript produces incremental outputs on a DIV, something like thisp  precodefunction     var newdiv  document.createElementdiv    newdiv.innerHTML  produceAnswer    result.appendChildnewdiv    if done        return     else        setTimeoutarguments.callee, 0      codepre  pUnder certain circumstances the computation will produce so much data that IE8 will fail  with this messagep  blockquote   pnot enough storage when dealing with too much datap blockquote  pThe question is  is there way I can work out how much data is too much datap  pas I said there is no bug to solve. Its a genuine out of memory because the computation  requires to create too many html elements.p  pMy idea would be to run a function before executing the computation to work out ahead if the browser will succeed. But to do so, in a generic way, I think I need to find the memory available to my browser.p  pAny suggestion is welcome.p
Negative 59458 pI am writing a program in c that accepts a filename as an argument on the command linep  precodegtgt .myprogram ..pathtofile.txt codepre  pI know I can simply open an fstream using codeargv[1]code, but the program needs more information about the exact location ie. full pathname of the file.p  pI thought about appending codeargv[1]code to codegetcwdcode, however obviously in the example above youd end up with codepath..pathtofile.txtcode. Not sure whether fstream would resolve that path automatically, but even if it did, I still dont have the full path without a lot of string processing.p  pOf course, that method wouldnt work at all if the path provided was already absolute. And since this program may be run on LinuxWindowsetc, simply detecting a starting  character wont work to determine whether the argument was a full path or not.p  pI would think this is a fairly common issue to deal with path names across multiple OSs. So bhow does one retreive the full path name of a command line argumentb and bhow is this handled between operating systemsbp

Negative 59458 pI am writing a template class that takes as an input a pointer and stores it. The pointer is meant to point to an object allocated by another class, and handed to the this containing class. p  pNow I want to create a destructor for this container. How should I free the memory pointed to by this pointer I have no way of knowing a priori whether it is an array or a single element. p  pIm sort of new to C, so bear with me.

Negative 59458 pIm writing a program which reads text from a file, and determines the number of sentences, words, and syllables of that file. The trick is, it must only read one character a time, and work with that. Which means it cant just store the whole file in an array.p  pSo, with that in mind, heres how my program worksp  precodewhilecharacter  EOF      check if the character is a endofsentence marker .     check if the character is whitespace   t n     must be a letter now     check if the letter is a vowel  codepre  pUsing a statemachine approach, each time the loop goes through, certain triggers are either 1 or 0, and this effects the count. I have had no trouble counting the sentences or the words, but the syllables are giving my trouble. The definition for syllable that I am using is any vowel or group of vowels counts as 1 syllable, however a single e at the end of a word does not count as a syllable.p  pWith that in mind, Ive created code such that p  precodeif character  A  E ...  o  u     if the last character wasnt a vowel then     set the flag for the letter being a vowel.     so that next time through, it doesnt get counted     and add one to the syllable count.     if the last character was a vowel, then dont change the flag and dont     add to the count.  codepre  pNow the problem i have, is my count for a given text file, is very low. The given count is 57 syllables, 36 words, and 3 sentences. I get the sentences correct, same with the words, but my syllable count is only 35.p  pI also have it setup so that when the program reads a . or whitespace it will look at the last character read, and if that is an e, it will take one off the syllable count. This takes care of the e being at the end of a word not counting as a vowel.p  pSo with this in mind, I know there must be something wrong with my methodology to get such a vast difference. I must be forgetting something.p  pDoes anyone have some suggestions I didnt want to include my entire program, but I can include certain blocks if necessary.p  pEDIT Some code...p  pI have if  endofsentence marker, then else if whitespace, then the final else which entails that only letters which can form words will be in this block. This is the only block of code which should have any effect on the counting of syllables...p  precodeifchrctr  A  chrctr  E  chrctr  I  chrctr  O  chrctr  U  chrctr  a  chrctr  e  chrctr  i  chrctr  o   chrctr  u                      ifchrctr  E  chrctr  e                              isE  1                          else                              isE  0                          ifskipSylb  1                              endSylb  1                 skipSylb  1                          else                              endSylb  0                 skipSylb  1                               else                      endSylb  0             skipSylb  0           codepre  pSo to explain... endSylb if 1, later in the program will add one to the count of syllables. skipSylb is used to flag if the last character was also a syllable. If skipSylb  1, then this is a block of vowels and we only want to add one to the counter. Now I have an isE variable, which just tells the program next time around that the last letter was an E. This means, next time through the while loop, if it is an end of sentence, or whitespace, and the last letter was E so isE  1, then we have added one too many syllables.p  pHopefully that helps. p  pSince the value is actually lower then what it should be, i thought perhaps the statements where i minus from the count are important too.  I use this if statement to decide when to minus from the countp  precode ifisE  1                    countSylb           codepre  pThis statement happens when the character is whitespace, or an end of sentence character. I cant think of anything else relevant, but i still feel like im not including enough. Oh well, let me know if something is unclear.p

Negative 59458 pDoes R6RS or Chez Scheme v7.9.4 have a library function to check if a list contains duplicate elementsp  pAlternatively, do either have any built in functionality for sets which disallow duplicate elements  So far, Ive only been able to find an example a hrefhttpwww.scheme.comtspl4examples.html.examples3as15 relnofollowherea.p  pThe problem with that is that it doesnt appear to actually be part of the Chez Scheme library.

Negative 59458 pI have written a singlethreaded asynchronous server in C running on Linux The socket is nonblocking and as for polling, I am using epoll. Benchmarks show that the server performs fine and according to Valgrind, there are no memory leaks or other problems.p  pThe only problem is that when a write command is interrupted because the client closed the connection, the server will encounter an EPIPE. I am doing the interrupted artificially by running the benchmarking utility siege with the parameter b. It does lots of requests in a row which all work perfectly. Now I press CTRLC and restart the siege. Sometimes I am lucky and the server does not manage to send the full response because the clients fd is invalid. As expected, errno is set to EPIPE. I handle this situation, execute close on the fd and then free the memory related to the connection. Now the problem is that the server blocks and does not answer properly anymore. Here is the strace outputp  precodeepollwait4, EPOLLIN, u320, u640, 128, 1  1 accept3, safamilyAFINET, sinporthtons55328, sinaddrinetaddr127.0.0.1, [16]  5 fcntl645, FGETFL                      0x2 flags ORDWR fcntl645, FSETFL, ORDWRONONBLOCK   0 epollctl4, EPOLLCTLADD, 5, EPOLLINEPOLLERREPOLLHUPEPOLLET, u32144039912, u64144039912  0 epollwait4, EPOLLIN, u32144039912, u64144039912, 128, 1  1 read5, GET userregister HTTP1.1rnHos..., 4096  161 send5, HTTP1.1 200 OKrnContentType t..., 106, MSGNOSIGNAL  106 ltltltlt send5, 00001000rn, 10, MSGNOSIGNAL  1 EPIPE Broken pipe        ltltltlt Why did the previous send work close5                                 0 epollwait4, EPOLLIN, u320, u640, 128, 1  1 accept3, safamilyAFINET, sinporthtons55329, sinaddrinetaddr127.0.0.1, [16]  5 ... codepre  pI deleted the printfs from the log in case youre wonderingp  pAs you can see, the client establishes a new connection which consequently is accepted. Then, its added to the EPOLL queue. epollwait signalises that the client sent data EPOLLIN. The request is parsed and and a response is composed. Sending the headers works fine but when it comes to the body, write results in an EPIPE.

Negative 59458 pI am relatively new to C, and I noticed something interesting today that I guess I have never noticed or perhaps I am missing something. Here is an NUnit test to give an examplep  precodeobject boolean1  false object booloan2  false Assert.Thatboolean1  booloan2 codepre  pThis unit test fails, but this one passesp  precodeobject string1  string object string2  string Assert.Thatstring1  string2 codepre  pIm not that surprised in and of itself that the first one fails seeing as boolean1, and boolean2 are different references. But it is troubling to me that the first one fails, and the second one passes. I read on MSDN somewhere that some magic was done to the String class to facilitate this. I think my question really is why wasnt this behavior replicated in bool As a note... if the boolean1 and 2 are declared as codeboolcode then there is no problem.p  pWhat is the reason for these differences or why it was implemented that way Is there a situation where you would want to reference a bool object for anything except its valuep
Negative 59458 pAnd I mean that in the same sense that a CJava codeforcode is just a funky syntax for a codewhilecode loop.p  pI still remember when first learning about the codeforcode loop in C, the mental effort that had to go into understanding the execution sequence of the three control expressions relative to the loop statement.

Negative 59458 pI have a three tier application under development and am creating integration tests for DAOs in the persistence layer.

The camera just stays on the screen with the Retake and Use buttons greyed out.p  pI have tried setting self.imagePicker  nil in viewDidUnload and have also tried NOT doing this so the view controller hasnt forgotten it when it needs to dismiss it after the memory warning.p  pAfter the photo is taken after the memory warning, the imagePicker does callback successfully didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo, but the imagePicker view remains on the screen.p  pAny helpideas would be greatly appreciated.p
Negative 59458 pI noticed while reading through my code that I have a static member function which alters a private member of its class through a pointer to an instance of said class.p  pIt compiles and functions without issue, but I just wanted to know whether or not it was kosher to edit a private variable in this way, from a member but static function, or if I should be implmenting a public setVar function.p  pNote that Im not trying to bypass standard coding practice by editing member variables from a static function  the function is necessarily static so that it can be run as a thread using the POSIX pthread library.p  pCheers, Wyattp

Negative 59458 pIm having a really hard time trying to animate the resizing of a codeUIWebViewcode, and just dont know where else to go.p  pHeres what I want to accomplish I have two views, one above the other imagine two squares, one on the top of the other. The top view is a codeUIWebViewcode, and the bottom one will be referred to as a general codeUIViewcode Im not having any problems with the bottom one. I adjust the two views every time new content is loaded just fine. I also have a button that should hide the bottom view or show it, depending on its previous state.p  pThats where the problem kicks in. When the bottom view is hidden, pressing the button will enlarge its frame and reduce the codeUIWebViewcode frame. Thats fine. But if the bottom view is being shown and the button is pressed, the codeUIWebViewcode frame will become larger, and there are some issues with itp  ul lipIf the codeUIWebViewcode is scrolled all the way to the bottom, it jumps up a little bit before coming down becoming largerpli lipIf the codeUIWebViewcode is scrolled all the way to the top, it comes down as expected, as long as there is enough content to be scrolled behind the bottom view.pli ul  pIn general, what Ive learned is that if the content yet behind the bottom view is LARGER than the amount of resizing happening, no jumping happens. Otherwise, it does.p  pIve done a lot of research, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3604812issuewhenresizinguiwebviewusinganimationasked a previous questiona and so Im assuming this is a consequence of lazy loading the codeUIWebViewcode. This jump happens so that it is automatically resized showing all the content, even if some of it is offscreen and then moves down. Otherwise, it would be expanding and loading new content at the same time, requiring a lot more processor power.p  pIve experimented with frames, bounds and centers, and so far have got nowhere. Is my assumption correct Is there no simple way to resize way to resize the codeUIWebViewcode so that it goes only down when becoming larger and keeps the bottom scrollp  pIn theory, I think the right way would be to make the codeUIWebViewcode larger to the top, keeping its current bottom position, and then animate bringing it down. This way, the top content would already be loaded. But I havent had any success with it.p  pIf anyone has any experience with this, please share. And thanks a lot.p

Negative 59458 pIm having trouble writing a IPhoneIOS ObjC SOAP client that talks to an application with a SOAP WS interface. The application uses a NuSOAP php webserver and encodes any payload above a certain size using gzipdeflate, whichever is enabled by the client.p  pI understand that NSURLConnection transparently decompresses any gzip encoded response and presents the decompressed response, but the raw response that is received in this case seems to be corrupt. I dumped the SOAP payload into a file and decompressed it using gunzip, it complains of an unexpected end of file. I did check the webserver and dumped the gzip response that it is sending to a file, this is decompressed without any error using gunzip. Seems like the response is getting corrupted on receipt.p  pI tried using both NSURLConnection and ASIHTTPRequest. With NSURLConnection, there is a difference of exactly 15 bytes every time, between the response Data length and the length mentioned in the responses HTTP header.

Negative 59458 pI want to allow users of my site to post urls. These urls would then be rendered on the site in the href attributes of a tags. Basically, user A posts a url, my site displays it on the page as an  tag, then user B clicks it to see pictures of kittens.p  pI want to prevent javascript execution and xss attacks, and ensure there are no malformed urls in the output I generate.p  pExample User A posts a malformed url, supposedly to pictures of kittens. My site tries to generate an  tag from user As data, then user B clicks the resulting link. User A has actually posted a malformed url which adds a javascript onclick event in the  to send the victims cookies to another site.p  pSo I want to only allow correctly formed urls, and block out anything other than httphttps protocols. Since Im not allowing anything here which doesnt look like a url, and the user is not providing me html, it should be pretty simple to check by parsing and reforming the url.p  pMy thinking is that parseurl should fail with an error on malformed urls, or it replaces illegal characters with . I can check the separated parts of the url for allowed protocols as well. Then by constructing a url using httpbuildurl, I take the parts separated by parseurl and put them back together into a url which is known to be correctly formed. So by breaking them down this way first, I can give the user an error message when it fails instead of putting a sanitized broken url in my page.p  pThe question is, will this prevent xss attacks from doing evil if a user clicks the link Does the parsed and rebuilt url need further escaping Is there a better way to do this Shouldnt this be a solved problem by now with functions in the standard php librariesp  pI really dont want to write a parser myself and Im not going to even consider regular expressions.p  pThanksp

Negative 59458 pIm going to start this off by saying that I am new to GLSL but have a decent amount of experience with OpenGL.p  pI currently have a project that I want to practice shaders with.

I also havent been able to find any questions here that I have been able to put to use.p  pAny help that you can give to a newbie at writing shaders would be appreciated.p  pThanks.p

Negative 59458 pSo that IO doesnt block the UI thread in my Android app, Im trying to move a file write operation into a separate thread. This is the code Im using to start a low priority thread to write about 1Mb from a byte bufferp  precodeThread t  new Threadnew Runnable    Override   public void run        Process.setThreadPriorityProcess.THREADPRIORITYBACKGROUND       try                FileOutputStream fos  new FileOutputStreamfilename         try                    final java.nio.channels.FileChannel outChannel  fos.getChannel           outChannel.writebyteBuffer           fos.getFD.sync                  finally                    if fos  null             fos.close                     catch Exception e            e.printStackTrace         t.setPriorityThread.MINPRIORITY t.start codepre  pThese threads are started in my app when certain UI events happen. Unfortunately, I still notice a huge amount of lag sometimes. My UI will freeze for 2 seconds every 10 or so times I startfinish one of the above threads. If I comment out the thread code, these delays disappear.p  pbWhat can I do to stop this IO operation from blocking my UI threadbp  pIm not sure what to do now to diagnose the problem. My understand was that the IO thread would become blocked when outChannel.write happened as it was waiting for an IO operation to finish, which would mean my UI thread would immediately take over. Is it the case the write operation actually requires a big chunk of CPU powerp  pEditp  pWith StrictView on which Im sure of because it caught some unrelated IO problems in the UI thread that I fixed first, I can confirm no IO occurs in my IO thread.p  pThe results of running traceview are quite puzzling. The UI problem is that, when Im performing drag and drop actions, every 10 or so times I do this the device seems to freeze for about 0.5 to 1s. The thing youre dragging will freeze and after a delay will eventually jump to where your finger is. In traceview, I kept dragging and dropping until this happened. For the case where this happens in traceview, my background threads arent running  but theres a sudden block of about 1 second where operations on my UI thread that are usually fast to call are taking about x10 longer to perform. For example, a call to .drawBitmap with a fixed size bitmap is shown as taking 0.2s to execute when every time before this the same .drawBitamp call is taking a tenth of this time. I could just be reading it wrong, but I dont know where to go from here or what to look for.p
Negative 59458 pIm in the planning stage of writing a Cocoa drawing application for Mac, not iOS, and Im trying to discern whether one of my features is technically possible via any of the drawing frameworks. Any help or relevant information would be greatly appreciated.p  pThe idea is to apply a 3D transformation to an object drawn with Quartz2D. Ive considered capturing the relevant portion of the canvas View where objects are drawn as an image and sending it to Core Animation, but that doesnt seem like the best option. Since this is a drawing application, its less about 3D animation than it is about the transformed shape. This solution is also less than ideal because I assume that if the 2D object were a vector path rather a bitmap image, I would have to rasterize it to apply such a transformation. The ideal implementation would enable the user to dynamically rotate a flat object in 3 dimensions until she found a suitable orientation, lock in this transformation, and still be able to manually adjust the paths vector points.p  pIs this feasible Would it require working directly with OpenGL Help of any kind is most welcome.p  pThank youp

Negative 59458 pFor the sake of brevity consider a facebook style image content serving app. Users can upload content as well as access content shared by other people. I am looking at best ways of handling this kind of file serving application through Java servlets. There is surprisingly little information available on the topic. Id appreciate if someone can tell me their personal experiences on a small setup a few hundred users. p  pSo far I am tempted to use the database as a file system using mongodb but the approach seems cumbersome and tedious and will need replicating part of the functionality already provided by OS native filesystems. I dont want to use commercial software or have the bandwidth to write my own like facebook. All I want is to be able to do this through free software on a small server with a RAID or something similar. A solution that scales well to multiple servers would be a plus. The important thing is to serve it through java servlets I am willing to look into alternatives but they have to be usable through java. p  pId appreciate any help.

Negative 59458 pI have some questions regarding the entity framework context instance management.p  pMy code base is composed of many independent componentsagents all running in one process that can only do work by reading messages from their corresponding queues at their conveniencewhenever the component is ready, it will pick up the next message from the queue so no concurrency issue at the component level p  pEach of the components need to interact with the database independent from other components. I am wondering what is the better way to setup the context instances for each component. Here are some of the optionsp  p1 Have one instance of the the context used by all components.  I think this is the worst as it creates many concurrency issuesp  p2 Give every component an independent instance of the context.

Negative 59458 pThis is more a design question than anything else...p  pI really like Scalas case classes and use them often. However, I find that Im often wrapping in my parameters in codeOptionscode or rather, Lifts codeBoxescode and setting default values to allow for flexibility and to account that a user might not always specify all the parameters. I think I adopted this practice from.p  pMy question is, is this a reasonable approach Given that everything may be optional, there can be a lot of boilerplate and checking, to the point whether I wonder whether Im not just using my case classes like codeMap[String, Any]code and wonder whether I wouldnt be better off just using a codeMapcode.p  pLet me give you a real example. Here I am modeling a money transferp  precodecase class Amountamount Double, currency Box[Currency]  Empty trait TransactionSide case class Fromamount Box[Amount]  Empty, currency Box[Currency]  Empty, country Box[Country]  Empty extends TransactionSide case class Toamount Box[Amount]  Empty, currency Box[Currency]  Empty, country Box[Country]  Empty extends TransactionSide case class Transactionfrom From, to To codepre  pRelatively simple to understand, I think. At this simplest we might declare a codeTransactioncode like sop  precodeval t  TransactionFromamountFullAmount100.0, TocountryFullUS codepre  pAlready I can imagine you think its verbose. And if we specify everythingp  precodeval t2  TransactionFromFullAmount100.0, FullEUR, FullEUR, FullNetherlands, ToFullAmount150.0, FullUSD, FullUSD, FullUS codepre  pOn the other hand, despite having to throw codeFullcode around everywhere, you can still do some nice pattern matchingp  precodet2 match    case TransactionFromFullAmountamountfrom, Fullcurrencyfrom1, Fullcurrencyfrom2, Fullcountryfrom, ToFullAmountamountto, Fullcurrencyto1, Fullcurrencyto2, Fullcountryto if countryfrom  countryto gt FailureYoure trying to transfer to the same country   case TransactionFromFullAmountamountfrom, Fullcurrencyfrom1, Fullcurrencyfrom2, FullUS, ToFullAmountamountto, Fullcurrencyto1, Fullcurrencyto2, FullNorthKorea gt FailureTransfers from the US to North Korea are not allowed   case TransactionFromFullAmountamountfrom, Fullcurrencyfrom1, Fullcurrencyfrom2, Fullcountryfrom, ToFullAmountamountto, Fullcurrencyto1, Fullcurrencyto2, Fullcountryto gt Full[something]   case  gt Empty  codepre  pIs this a reasonable approach Would I be better served by using a codeMapcode Or should I use case classes but in a different fashion Perhaps using a whole hierarchy of case classes to represent transactions with different amounts of information specified p

If the instantiation fails for any reason we know there are connection issues and we redirect the user to a maintenance page.p  pThis works fine until we turn our session state server setting on.

Negative 59458 pI would like to put some code in module that throws an error if certain method is not defined. This module relies on the external definition of this method, since this methods implementation is different for all classes. This code would help developers know early that they forgot to implement the method rather than when they tried to use features of the module.p  precodemodule MyModule   def self.includedklass     raise MyModule please def mymethod on klass unless klass.respondtomymethod   end end  codepre  pI can easily raise an error in a modules included definition if a method is not defined, however since most modules are included at the top of a file, its likely that my required method is defined in the class, but not before my module is included. p  precodeclass MyClass   include MyModule   def self.mymethod      ...   end end codepre  pThis would still raise an error p  pIs it possible to raise an error only if the method truly is not defined in the class definition Almost need a class.onload callback of sorts. If not, any other ideas for how to mitigate the possibilities that a programmer might include our module without defining this needed method p

Negative 59458 pThe last few days have been spent debugging a very strange problem.  An application built for i386 running on Windows crashed, with the top of the callstack completely corrupted and the instruction pointer in a nonsense location.p  pAfter some effort, I rebuilt the callstack and was able to determine how the IP ended up in the nonsense location.  An instruction in boost shared pointer code attempts to call a function defined in my DLLs import address table using an incorrect offset.  The instruction looks likep  precodecall dword ptr [nonsense offset into import address table] codepre  pAs a result, execution ended up in a bad location that was, unfortunately, executable.  Execution then proceeded, gobbling up the top of the stack until eventually crashing.p  pBy launching the identical application on my PC, and stepping into the problematic code, I can find the same call instruction and see its supposed to by calling msvc100s new operator.  p  pFurther comparing the minidump from the clients PC to my PC, I found that my PC was calls a function with an offset of 0x0254 into the address table.  On the clients PC, the code is trying to invoke a function with an offset of 0x8254.p  pWhats even more confusing is that this offset is not coming from a register or another memory location.  The offset is a constant in the disassembly.  So, the disassembly looks likep  precodecall dword ptr [ 0x50018254 ] codepre  pnot likep  precodecall dword ptr [ edx ] codepre  pDoes anyone know how this might happenp

Negative 59458 pIn the last year, has there been any new developments in simplifying this combo, or is it basically the same as it always wasp  pI dont really like a lot of the new RAD frameworksplatforms Rails, etc.. I think they are great for small apps, or proof of concepts... but I usually get so annoyed with their shortcomings pretty quickly when I move on to complex requirements. Rails in particular has many issues  surprisingly far too many that actually slowed me down compared to how long it would have taken me in Java... things that I think most people would never run into ever... or perhaps never run into until their honeymoon period was over with.p  pI would simply rather have the power and reliability of SpringJava in many cases, even it means it will take me longer to develop the application. I feel comfortable with that. I trust it. I know how to deploy it. It works, and it works well for large applications. p  pId really like to improve my development experience as much as possible. Im looking for what people usually like using for largescale, web 2.0 ria type of projects these days in their SpringHibernate projects or SpringWhatever works too I guess....p  ol lipIm pretty convinced that dbunit is outdated, and is a large source of my testing performance problems. Is there anything similar to a factory girl, but for javapli lipIs there any way to make links more applicationlike, rather than just loosestrings I tend to refactor urls a lot, and manually testing the application to ensure nothing breaks is kind of a big pain. Id appreciate any solutions to this. I use FreemarkerSpring MVC currently.pli lipI am finding that I need to use more and more AJAX in my applications. Simple ajax is fine, but currently I have to use Jackson to parse incoming request JSON before it goes to a Spring MVC controller. A lot of this parsingmapping is very timeconsuming. There has to be a better way. Is there I dont want to program parsersobject mappers for incoming JSON requests to my controller tier anymore.pli lipOne of the things I really liked in Rails was the ability to piece queries together and have reusable query pieces. I forget what they called them. Is there a way to do this using HibernateSpring I have a lot of queries that use massive HQL strings, and a lot of the time, segments of these queries are just repeated over and over again throughout the application. Id like to reuse what I can here. Can it be donepli lipI typically run into far too many small problems when I deploy that would never be caught when testing. Hibernate proxy bugs and weird lazyloading issues are on the top of this list, but even annotation problems with Spring MVC controllers and a variety of other issues can crop up that are hard to test or maybe impossible to test. What are some solutions to these kinds of problems Not use Hibernate Do some other kind of testing What works I dont mind doing testing, but I want it to be fast, otherwise I will probably get aggravated and will refuse to do it.pli lipGenerally anything else you think would help productivity that I may not have heard about.

Negative 59458 pI was attempting to use ObjectIDGenerator in C to generate a unique ID during serialization, however, this class is not available in the XBox360 or Windows Phone 7 .NET frameworks they use a compact version of .NET. I implemented a version using a dictionary of Object to Int64 and was able to get a fully working version up, however, the performance is unsatisfactory. Im serializing on the order of tens of thousands of objects, and currently this is the greatest bottleneck in saveload performance. Using the actual .NET implementation on PC it takes about 0.3 seconds to serialize about 20,000 objects. Using my implementation, it takes about 6 seconds.p  pIn profiling, I found that the heavy hitters were .TryGetValue and .Add on the dictionary which makes sense since its both indexing and adding to the hash map. More importantly, the virtual equality operator was being called instead of simply comparing references, so I implemented an IEqualityComparer that only used ReferenceEquals this resulted in a speed increase.p  pDoes anyone have an insight into a better implementation of ObjectIDGenerator Thanks for your helpp  pMy Implementation a hrefhttppastebin.comH1skZwNK relnofollowhttppastebin.comH1skZwNKap  p[Edit] Another note, the results of profiling says that the object comparison  ReferenceEquals is still the bottleneck, with a hit count of 43,000,000. Im wondering if theres a way to store data along side this object without having to look it up in a hash map...p

I myself remember to be struggling with such structures before Apache CXF back when I used XFire.p  pHowever, this is not the case here. I want to produce a different result. I want that the enum be translated into a Complex Type and that both attributes code and message are translated into XML elements when an object containing an instance of this enumeration is marshalled. I only want it to not behave like an enum. I know I could accomplish that if I used a plain class instead of an enum. However, Id very much like to keep it an enum so I kept it typesafe in the javapart of the code.p  pIf the generated WSDL could still have a restriction as to the possible values, it would be the perfect scenario. I could do without it, however. The main thing here would be to keep it a Java 1.5 enum while still marshalling and generating a WSDL ReturnCode as a Complex Type with code and message as its elements.p  pI tried to hint that with the given JAXWS Annotations placed in the enum source code. Is it somehow possible to accomplish that with just those or some other annotations Or would I have to write a custom marshallerunmarshaller and WSDLgeneratorp  pThank you very muchp  pBest regards,p  pFilipe Fedaltop

Negative 59458 pI need to create a relatively simple Java tcpip server and Im having a little trouble determining if I should use something like Netty or just stick with simple ServerSocket and InputStreamOutputStream.p  pWe really just need to listen for a request, then pass the new client Socket off to some processing code in a new thread. That thread will terminate once the processing is complete and the response is sent. p  pI like the idea of pipelines, decoders, etc. in Netty, but for such a simple scenario it doesnt seem worth the added up front development time. It seems like a bit overkill for our initial requirements, but Im a little nervous that there are lots of things Im not considering. What, if any, are the benefits of Netty for such simple requirements What am I failing to considerp

Negative 59458 pI have an Event model that includes a start time field, which is stored in UTC and mapped to the DB.

This is silly because the timezone isnt variable between rows, but the model doesnt know that. My current setup passes the timezone information to codestartlocalcode, and that fixes the speed problem but is not a very pleasant from a design perspective.

Negative 59458 pIm writing an app that stores the location of the places you have been throughout the day. Ive done a lot of research on CLLocationManager, and have been testing my app for the last 3 weeks. The locations I get with CLLocationManager sometimes is very inaccurate, sometimes 4 or 5 miles away from where I am.  I have a log in my test app and realized that every time I get a new location my DidUpdateToLocation method is called 3 times in a row, like within one second, and I get 3 different locations. One of them is always right, but the other 2 are off. Ive tested with it with different accuracieshundredMeters, nearestTenMeters, and Best, but still had the same problem. So, my first question isp  pIs there anyway I can find out which of these locations is the right one so I can store itp  pIve also realized that the users current location on the map view is always very accurate, so I thought about getting the users location from the mapViewblue dot instead of the CLLocationManager, but I learned that a mapView object will only return the current location if the map is actually on screen, and this is not the case since I want my app to run in the background. So the second question isp  pIs there anyway to get the users current location from a mapView without the map being on screen Or at least use the same technique the mapView uses for finding the current locationp  pIf you have any experience with mapKit and CLLocationManager, please share your thoughts.p  pThanks for you time. Any help is appreciated.p

Negative 59458 pI am using Quartz 2D to make a simple multitouch drawing iPad game. The game requires me to draw a new stroke at the finger position every 130th of a second.p  pAs far as I know, there is basically no way to get drawRect to not clear the context every time it is called self.clearsContextBeforeDrawing  NO does not work, so my solution was to create a back buffer bitmap or layer, I can use both, draw every new small stroke into that back buffer every iteration for each finger, and then copy the buffer into the screen every call to drawRect. In other wordsp  precodebacklayer  CGLayerCreateWithContextcontext, CGSizeMakeW, H, NULL offctx  CGLayerGetContext backlayer  codepre  pand then p  precode voiddrawRectCGRectrect       CGContextRef context  UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext      code here to draw small strokes from old finger position to new one      CGContextDrawLayerInRectcontext, [self bounds], backlayer  codepre  pThis worked without problems while I was testing on my iPad 2, but yesterday I noticed that this same code runs much slower on the new iPad 3. The performance is abysmal, slowing my game down from 30FPS all the way to about 5 or so, probably due to the larger, retina display. I have the same problem if I use a separate CGBitmapContext that I create, and then every iteration I create an ImageRef from it and paint it with CGContextDrawImage.p  pWhat approach could I take to address this It seems like I must redraw everything every iteration since its not good enough to even pass a small rectange to drawRect of what has changed since every iteration there would need to be several rectangles for each fingerp  pThank youp

Negative 59458 pMy application requires that a user select a location on a MapView.  I will be using Google Places API to place location markers on the map. There will be times however when a user might select a location, for example a fountain in a park, that IS NOT listed in the Places API.  One option is to offer users a choice of selecting a location with a touch on a map, OR selecting map markers of known locations using two different maps for each activity.  I think the perfect solution however would be to use one MapView that contains the mapmarkers but also allow the user to select a location that does not have an associated marker.p  pMy thoughts were to apply a reticle in its own Overlay that stays centered in the middle of the MapView despite scrolling and a select button to make the selection.p  pIf the reticle is over a marker, for example, Sams Cafe, then the button would read Select Sams Cafe, if the reticle isnt over any Map Markers, then the button would read Select this location.p  pI am having trouble figuring out a way to verify the reticle is over a marker.  Since the marker is limited to a single GeoPoint, its going to be very difficult, frustrating and time consuming for the user to try and match the reticle center to the exact GeoPoint.p  pWhat would be optimal is a check to see if the reticle is over the Map Marker graphic.  I presume this will utilize projections and boundsp  pTwo questions, How to do this if possible or, is there a better UI that I am overlooking that is much easier to achievep  pThank you for your consideration.p

Negative 59458 pstrongBackground infostrongp  pI have a set of proprietary embeddedlinux network devices, one of which will be configured as a DHCP server and the rest will be DHCP clients.p  pI need to have the clientdevices only accept DHCP lease offers from the serverdevice, ignoring any other leases offered by other DHCP servers on the same LAN. Similarly, I need to make the serverdevice only serve DHCP requests to this set of clients, ignoring any other DHCP requests which may appear in an unknown network environment. Essentially, I need to be able to provide a DHCP service for my own devices in a network environment which may already have a DHCP server.p  pAll of my devices have the same first half of the MAC address which I intend to use as a filter.p  pI am using udhcpc and udhcpd which are included in BusyBox and am trying to avoid adding any other DHCP clientserver packages to my devices due to limited storage availability, but I am open to modifying BusyBox code.p  pI had no trouble implementing the DHCP server restrictions by adding an option to udhcpd.conf, which I called codechaddrfiltercode, containing a wildcarded MAC address the server should check the Client Hardware Address chaddr against. This seems to be working just fine and the server ignores any DHCP requests from other devices while serving my own.p  pThe clientside filtering turns out to be a bigger challenge, due to a lack of a Server Hardware Address field in a DHCP packet.p  pstrongSo heres my questionstrong p  pemWhats the best way to pass my servers MAC to my udhcpc clientemp  pCurrently it looks like there are no fields or options being passed from the DHCP server that contain the servers MAC doesnt look like I can read it from Ethernet layer. Id like to remain standardscompliant, so Im looking through potential DHCP Options which I may use for this purpose. p  pI was hoping I could use Option 54 Server identifier, but the RFC defines it as an IP address.p  pIm thinking of putting the servers MAC in either Option 60 Classidentifier or Option 43 Vendor specific information, is there a reason I shouldnt do this Is there a better field for thisp  pI look forward to any suggestions.p

Negative 59458 pAs part of my CS education, I am in the process of building a multiplayer Android yatzy game with clients linked together by a TCP server based on RubyEventMachine with JSON messages representing game events passed back and forth.p  pHowever, Im feeling uncertain about how to optimally handle game turn management.p  pA typical yatzy game consists of 15 rounds. My implementation will handle up to 4 players. Events like dice rolls, dice holds and score choices are sent to the Ruby server and broadcast to the other players.p  pCurrently, my server is handling game turns. Each time it receives a new score choice from a client, it broadcasts the score to the other clients. Subsequently it broadcasts a message with the user id of the next player to roll the dice.p  pI would like my system to be able to handle players dropping out without ending the game for the remaining players as a grim side effect. Ive come up with a solution, but Im not confident that its ideal.p  precodeturnfiber  Fiber.new do   15.times do     players.each do key, value       Fiber.yield value     end   end end codepre  pcodeturnfibercode is an instance variable belonging to a game object which represents the running game. codeplayerscode is a hash which uses the players unique ids as keys and the corresponding player object as value.p  pcodeturnfiber.resumecode is called each time a turn has ended through a score choice submission to retrieve the next player to roll the dice and broadcast his permission to roll. The idea is that if a player leaves the game in say turn 4, his client will send a quit message that will remove the leaving player from the codeplayerscode hash, broadcast his departure, and because the player no longer resides in the codeplayerscode hash, prevent succeeding iterations from handing dice control to the dead player thereby avoiding a deadlock. So far my Android client is incomplete, so I have not yet tested if this theory actually works in practice.p  pMy choice of the Fiber class is based on a desire to be able to iterate 15 times over the codeplayerscode and have them roll the dice one at a time. Fibers makes this possible since they pause the loop each time codeyieldcode is called and returns the player.p  pI would like your thoughts about this approach, particularly what weaknesses it has and what alternatives you think I should consider to solve this problem of turn management.p

Negative 59458 pIm wondering if its possible to introduce type variables within the scope of a method in Java. That is, limiting their scope within the method body.p  pHowever, rather than trying to describe the problem in the abstract, let my illustrate with my concrete problem. I have a couple of classes that look a bit like thisp  precodepublic class Settings      public static abstract class SettingltTgt          public T value         public abstract T fallbackvalue           private final ListltSettingltgtgt settings  codepre  pI now want to write a function, in codeSettingscode, for setting the value of all the Settings to their fallback values as provided by the abstract method. My first thought would be to do it like thisp  precodepublic void reset      forSettingltgt setting  settings         setting.value  setting.fallbackvalue  codepre  pHowever, on second thought it is rather obvious why this does not work the capture of codeltgtcode for setting.value is not the same capture as for codesetting.fallbackvaluecode. Ergo, I need some way to unify the captures. It is empossibleem to solve it like thisp  precodeprivate static ltTgt void reset1SettingltTgt s      s.value  setting.fallbackvalue   public void reset      forSettingltgt setting  settings         reset1setting  codepre  pThe explicit type variable codeltTgtcode for codereset1code unifies the captures conveniently, but its obviously the ugliest thing in the world to introduce this function, pollute the namespace, clutter the screen and make the code less readable merely to satisfy the type system.p  pIs there no way I can do this within the body of coderesetcode What Id like to do is simply something like thisp  precodepublic void reset      forSettingltgt setting  settings          ltTgt              SettingltTgt foo  setting             foo.value  foo.fallbackvalue                codepre  pIts not the prettiest thing in the world, but at least to my eyes it is far less strainful than the variant above.

Negative 59458 pContext Im working on an analytics system for an ordering system. There are about 100,000 orders per day and the analytics need to run for the last N say, 100 days months. The relevant data fits in memory. After N days, all orders are evicted from the memory cache,  with an entire day in the past being evicted. Orders can be created or updated.p  ol lipA traditional approach would use a codeConcurrentHashMapltDate, QueueltOrdergtgtcode. Every day, values for keys representing dates more than N days in the past will be deleted. But, of course, the whole point of using Guava is to avoid this. EDIT changed codeMapcode to codeConcurrentHashMapcode, see the end of the question for rationale.pli lipWith Guava collections, a codeMultiMap ltDate, Ordergtcode would be simpler. Eviction is similar, implemented explicitly.pli lipWhile the codeCachecode implementation looks appealing after all, I am implementing a Cache, Im not sure about the eviction options. Eviction only happens once a day and its best initiated from outside the cache, I dont want the cache to have to check the age of an order. Im not even sure if the cache would use a MultiMap, which I think its a suitable data structure in this case.pli ol  pThus, my question is is it possible to use a Cache that uses and exposes the semantics of a MultiMap and allows evictions controlled from outside itself, in particular with the rule I need delete all orders older than N days p  pAs an important clarification, Im not interested in a codeLoadingCachecode but I do need bulk loads if the application needs to be restarted, the cache has to be populated, from the database, with the last N days of orders.p  pEDIT Forgot to mention that the map emneeds to be concurrentem, as orders come in they are evaluated live against the previous orders for the same customer or location etc.  p  pEDIT2 Just stumbled over a hrefhttpcode.google.compguavalibrariesissuesdetailid135 relnofollowGuava issue 135a.

Negative 59458 pI just added support for album art in my Android application and Ive encountered a problem where displaying the album art in a layout causes the application memory to spike and the playback service is eventually killed to free up memory. I believe the issue is that Im adding the extracted album art to the layout without compressing it. This results in a large image having to be cached in memory. The code Im using to make the Bitmap isp  precodebyte [] blob  mCursor.getBlobmCursor.getColumnIndexOrThrowMedia.MediaColumns.PICTURE  if blob  null      return BitmapFactory.decodeByteArrayblob, 0, blob.length  codepre  pIs it possible to uniformly scalecompress these Bitmaps to reduce their memory footprint. Also, is there a way to compress directly using the byte array rather then an inputstream.p

However, I found it is not too efficient as since I need several morphological operations to fill it for my case. So I am looking for some alternatie approaches. Could someone suggest me Ive searched for papers, and found some, but I dont have enough time to implement a new algorithm now. Thanks in advance. p

I got distribute partly installed but Im might have seen some errors at the end of its installation so Im not sure its working and it wont install pyttsx anyway.  Theres a Windows .exe program that will let you install Python packages but it wont work for 64bit Python.  Ive been searching for answers for days can cant come up with anything specific enough.p  pHow do I install Python packages with 64bit Python 3.3 on 64bit Windows 7, or is that even possiblep

Negative 59458 pI believe that my question is p  pIs there a simple usermode TCP stack on PC operating systems that could be used to exchange data over a lossy serial link with a Linuxbased devicep  pHere is more contextp  pI have a Linuxbased device connected via a serial link to a PC. The serial link is lossy so data being sent between the two devices sometimes needs to be retransmitted. Currently the system uses a custom protocol that includes framing, addressing for routing to different processes within the Linux device, and a notsorobust retransmission algorithm. p  pOn the Linux device side, it would be convenient to replace the custom protocol, implement SLIP over the serial link and use TCP for all communications. The problem is that on the PCside, were not sure how to use the hosts TCP stack without pulling in general IP routing that we dont need. If there were a usermode TCP stack available, it seems like I could integrate that in the PC app. The only TCP stacks that Ive found so far are for microcontrollers. They could be ported, but it would be nice if there were something more readytogo. Or is there some special way to use the OSs built in TCP stack without needing administrative privileges or risking IP address conflicts with the real Ethernet interfaces.p  pLastly, just to keep the solution focused on TCP, yes, there are other solutions to this problem such as using HDLC or just fixing our custom protocol. However, we wanted to explore the TCP route further in case it was an option.p

Negative 59458 pI have a static class that wraps around .NET events like codeUnhandledExceptioncode and codeProcessExitcode of the CurrentAppDomain object, so that when the caller calls emInitializeem on the class, it subscribes my own handlers for these events, and later on the caller may add his own handler methods, using a dedicated API. It it designed that way so I am able to control the order of handlers execution once the event is fired.p  pMy question is Is it possible to unit test such a class p  pFor instance, I would like to know that when an unhandled exception is thrown, my private handler has executed. the problem is that when I throw unhandled exception, that will be the result of the test correct me if Im wrong.

Negative 59458 pIs there an approach to collectreport on unit test coverage based on a complexity ratio such as Cyclomatic Complexity on a methodfunction levelp  pThe reasonintent is to provide a measurable metric to show any areas that have a higher chance of defects based on complexity actually have appropriate unit test coverage i.e. a metric away out of 100 or 80 coverage by changing the metric to 100 of Cyclomatic Complexity  10 for example.p  pMy usecase is currently Javajunit, and a different approach to reach the same intent would also be helpful doesnt have to be exactly methodfunction based on Cyclomatic, but similar type of measurement.p  pEDIT if there is a code coverage tool with similar features for both java and .NET, that would be phenomenal.p  pthanky Darrenp
Negative 59458 pI am about to implement a concurrent linked singly list on c and would like to clarify some points with someone who could have a similar challenge before. Background initially the list was planned to be a part of skip list, which in turn was a part of inmemory index. When I had started implementing this I would think why not to create a generic solution in stllike manner which could be used aside of skip list. But it seems that the way of how concurrent containers work might differ from singlethreaded ones very much. For exapmle, insert and delete operations take iterator as an input argument in stdlist, but in case of concurrent  implementation an iterator gets invalid if another thread modifies the list in its vicinity.p  pIts not a problem if the list is a layer of a skip list, since it is sorted in this case, and iterators can be avoided. But Im curious if anybody tried to implement a generic solution how the issue was resolved.p  pAnother question.. is it worthwhile to make such a container compatible with stl algorithms It appears that most of them could fail due to concurrency.p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 59458 pI need your help concearning the Android Preference API and working with the onPreferenceChange listener.p  pI will parse some sourcecode externally as I dont want the post to be bloated upp  pI implemented a Settings Screen according to the Google Developer Docs using the Preference API a hrefhttppastebin.com79HJxP3h relnofollowhttppastebin.com79HJxP3hap  pSo far so good.

This is the fragment that gets opened a hrefhttppastebin.com7vQNyUd2 relnofollowhttppastebin.com7vQNyUd2ap  pMy problem is that I was unsure how to get changes in my Settings Screen to be stored and processed in the rest of my app. I found the SharedPreferences and wanted to use them. As you can see in my class I create 5 seperate Preference Objects, create listeners for every one of them and then in the actual OnPreferenceChangeListener check for the key and then change their SharedPreference values accordingly.p  pBut for some reason Im getting really random results. For example checking all the checkboxes turns all the values in my Map the System Out to true, however changing them back doesnt turn them back to false until the next value changes e.g. unchecking another Boxp  pNow, Im really not sure if thats just because of the way I check the values because it updates the values after the check Why would it work for false  true thenp  pThis isnt really a specific question but I hope somebody can help me out with this. Am I making an obvious mistake Or is there maybe a better way of handling Preferences for an Application As I said, the documentations on this subject are really...not that good. They either show the first steps on how to create the Settings screen and then leave you at that or they talk about SharedPreferences in an activity based environment without having input from the Preferences API to begin with.p

Negative 59458 pCurrently Im working on implementing HL7 CDA for a large hospital which has both outpatient and inpatient clinics. To decrease average duration of consultation, consulting physicians use electronic forms. Forms must be thoroughly formalized and ideally require minimum keyboard input. p  pIn practice it appears that simplest formalized Consultation Note form contains not less than 4050 input fields. p  pFor example, an ordinary otolaryngologists Consultation Note Physical Examination section includes the following subsections external nose, internal nose, throat, larynx, trachea note that nose is symmetric, and that each organ can be described by 1015 characteristics  so as a result I have an input form with about 100 input fields. Add to this form other required sections defined by the HL7 CDA Consultation Note spec reason for visit, history of illness, problems, medications  and you have got 150 fields. Consequently, my HL7 CDA level 3 document body shall contain the same number of [observation] elements.p  pDuring an ordinary inpatient case physicians can register up to 10100 documents. And each document contains 20100200 meaningful parameters. In total 10000 parameters. p  pAt the end of the inpatient case a physician shall create a summary document which gathers data from other documents registered earlier. And at this point I feel that I misunderstand HL7 CDA spec. A human being cannot operate with 10000 parameters easily. Could you please give me an advise or example on how to design ergonomic user form that allows a physician to create a brief Summary Document p

Assumption that registered users will read article many times it is evolvingli liI use MongoDB as a storeli liI would like it to be close to real timeli liMy system will have a registration, but I want to count the views of anonymous users as well li ol  pI understand that the best way to count unique visits is through registration, but the thing is that a big chunk of users will be just passive readers who do not need to create an account to read the information from the application. As far as I understand, the most convenient way is to save IP address of every user, who read the post. I also understand that IP address will not provide uniqueness some different users will have the same IP, because they are behind the same ISP and one user can have different IPs, by using proxies, tor etcp  pThe use of Mongo is not absolutely essential, just the thing is that everything is written in Mongo right now, so I will switch only if it will be much fasterconvenient.p

The UI uses Twitter bootstrap, some parts of jQuery UI and it also contains some of my own JS and CSS. This bundle is in a private git repo.p  pI also created a second bundle CMSBundle which imports inherits BackendBundle and adds some CMS functionalities to the backend. The CMSBundle obviously uses the UI of BackendBundle, but has some extra CSSJS of its own.p  pA website project is a symfony project which includes both bundles using composer, so the bundles are downloaded to the vendor folder. p  pThe problem is that my Gruntfile.js resides in the root folder of the project aka website, and has no knowledge of the the imported bundles requirements.p  pIs there a way to includeimport tasks provided by a specific bundle in a seperate Gruntfile.js file p

User has a firstName field and a lastName field. It also has a FullName property that returns the firstName concatenated with the lastName. It has a method called Matchstring name that takes a name and returns a percentage using some secret algorithm that tells you how much User is love compatible with a person of that name.

The data for Voyages is being imported from a text file that contains the countrys names.  What I wanted achieve is the followingp  ol liWhen a new row is added to the Voyages table, a new row will be added to the Countries table first generating a new countryID and inserting the countrys name.li liWhen the new Country row is added, the generated countryID will then be used to insert a new Voyages row setting the countryID as destinationID. li ol  pI know I could do this in my application by parsing the text file, extracting the country name, and adding it to the DB in order to get the new countryID. Then I could add a new Voyages row using the new ID. But could I also do the whole Job in the DB I thought about using a Trigger. p  pBut then I would have the problem that I initially would have to insert a country name string to the Voyages table, while in the end I want to insert a countryID int instead.p  pThis would be some sort of Workaround which I really dont likep  precodeINSERT INTO voyages voyageID, destinationID, destinationString VALUES 1, 0, BRAZIL codepre  pLike this, I could create a Trigger INSTEAD OF INSERT that extracts destinationString in order to insert a new country rowp  precodeINSERT INTO countries countryName VALUES BRAZIL codepre  pThe resulting countryID e.g. 27 could then be used inside my trigger to finally insert the new row to voyagesp  precodeINSERT INTO voyages voyageID, destinationID, destinationString VALUES 1, 27, NULL codepre  pIs there any more elegant way to do thisp  pThanks a lotp

Negative 59458 pWhile reading a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCovarianceandcontravariance28computerscience29Arrays relnofollowsectiona of an article about covariance and contravariance at Wikipedia, I ran into the following, bolded sentencep  blockquote   pFirst consider the array type constructor from the type codeAnimalcode we can make the type codeAnimal[]code array of animals. Should we treat this asp      ul   liCovariant a codeCat[]code is a codeAnimal[]codeli   liContravariant a codeAnimal[]code is a codeCat[]codeli   lior neither invariantli   ul      pIf we wish to avoid type errors, and the array supports both reading and writing elements, then only the third choice is safe. Clearly, not every codeAnimal[]code can be treated as if it were a codeCat[]code, since a client reading from the array will expect a Cat, but an codeAnimal[]code may contain e.g. a codeDogcode. So the contravariant rule is not safe.p      pstrongConversely, a codeCat[]code can not be treated as a codeAnimal[]code.strong It should always be possible to put a codeDogcode into a codeAnimal[]code. With covariant arrays this can not be guaranteed to be safe, since the backing store might actually be an array of cats. So the covariant rule is also not safethe array constructor should be invariant. Note that this is only a issue for mutable arrays the covariant rule is safe for immutable readonly arrays.p blockquote  pI understand the concept I just want an emexampleem of how this cannot be guaranteed to be safe in C.p

Negative 59458 pThe existing software uses C to code the communication layer as a single object. Microsoft COM object is used to connect the communication object to the upper layer of the UI. It exposes interfaces using the COM object.p  pNew software requires me to create a completely different communication object that is radically different from the existing communication object. I can either choose to code it in C as a separate class or create another COM object and reuse some of the C code to create the object.p  pBeing a C native, I want to hear your advices before making a decision on how this future software change should be made.

Negative 59458 pWhen an exception is thrown the data that is added to the datastore is not rolled back. Is this correct behaviour since it uses the filesystem Or should it also roll back the data in  datastore. I am using Spring 3.2. I have deployed Jackrabbit to JBoss 7.1.1. I am using JtaTransactionManager since I am also using a database. Editp  pAfter reading about JTA and Spring I added only this line to the Spring config file.  Seems like it registers the necessary things. In the test that I have set up I store a file in Jackrabbit, then I throw an runtimeexception and after that I would normally persisted to database but since the exception aborts it it never run that far, however that would be the normal case. All this happens inside one method in the service layer annotated with codeTransactionalcode. However after the exception is thrown I still see the file in the datastore, I tried with an empty datastore and I would expect the file to be gone after the exception is thrown, but it is still there. Is this correct Is it only the meta data which I dont know where are stored that is rolled backp  precodelttxjtatransactionmanagergt codepre

Negative 59458 pIm developing a desktop software application which looks for errors in web pages and can highlight them in the browser. Highlighted areas are somewhat arbitrary. They could be one word in a p tag, an entire a tag or an img.p  pIn the past Ive done this by rewriting the html and adding styled span tags around the highlighted area. The downside is that quite often the highlights can be obscured. For example where in image is in a div exactly its size with no overflow, any applied border, background etc. will be obscured.p  pWhats the best way to approach this Are there any good examples of this being done in popular software  webappsp  pLimitations I cant use JS files are local and browsers often block this. I can however user the latest standards. The output doesnt have to validate, as long as it works on common modern browsers.p

Negative 59458 pI have a pullqueue in Google App Engine and a resident backend which processes the tasks in the pull queue. The backend has several worker threads for consuming and processing tasks, as suggested in a post in Google Cloud Platform blogp  pa hrefhttpscloud.google.comresourcesarticlesiospushnotifications relnofollowhttpscloud.google.comresourcesarticlesiospushnotificationsap  pWorkers poll the pullqueue with leasetasks. My question is is leasetasks supposed to be a blocking method, i.e. block the current threads execution until either the queue has some tasks or a deadline is exceededp  pAccording to the GAE documentation p  pa hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comappenginedocspythontaskqueueoverviewpullPythonLeasingtasks relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comappenginedocspythontaskqueueoverviewpullPythonLeasingtasksap  pleasetasks accepts a deadline parameter and may raise the DeadlineExceededError, thus isnt rational to assume that leasetasks blocks up to deadline secondsp  pThe problem is that while I m developing the application in the development server, leasetasks returns immediately with an empty list of tasks. The result is that  the worker threads whileloop is constantly calling leasetasks, thus consuming 100 of CPU. If I put an explicit sleep, say for 5 sec, that will make the worker go to sleep and wont wake up if a task is placed in the queue in the mean time. That would make the worker less responsive worst case, it might take 5 secs for handling the next task, plus I would consume more CPU wake upsleep cycles than just having the thread block in a queue I know the pullqueue is actually an RPC, yet it abstractly remains a producer queuep  pPerhaps this happens only with the dev app server while in GAE leasetasks blocks. However, the example code from the blog post mentioned above also suspends thread execution with sleep. The example code is available in github and a link is in the blog post unfortunately I cannot post it herep

Negative 59458 pIs it possible to create a DoS attack in IPv6 by using ICMP packet too big messagesp  pSo for instance, say you want to deny access to somewhere by somehow spoofing an ICMP packet too big message, and set the size to 68 octets the minimum for IPv4, to throttle any traffic that a particular node receives.  Would this kind of attack be possiblep  pIn RFC 1981 it saysp  blockquote   pA node MUST NOT reduce its estimate of the Path MTU below the IPv6 minimum link MTU.       Note A node may receive a Packet Too Big message reporting a nexthop MTU that is less than the IPv6 minimum link MTU.  In that case, the node is not required to reduce the size of subsequent packets sent on the path to less than the IPv6 minimun link MTU, but rather must include a Fragment header in those packets [IPv6SPEC].p blockquote  pSo this case in RFC 1981 would normally only occur in the case that theres a IPv6IPv4 translation where an IPv4 node would have an MTU smaller than 1280.  If my understanding is correct however, if theres an IPv6IPv4 tunnel along the path, we can significantly slow down the traffic since the IPv6IPv4 node would fragment it.p  pHowever, this didnt quite make sense to me since IPv6 doesnt allow fragmentation.p

Negative 59458 pI have a SCORM eLearning web app javascripthtml that loads content from xml files via ajax requests. These xml files are generated from a CMS Content management system built from drupal, so the content changes every so often.p  pSince the content text, images changes infrequently I want the data to be cached in the users browser most of the time, but not when the content is updated. Currently I have a cachebuster string that gets updated when any content does and I use that string in the url when loading any of these files eg. pathtocontent.xmluncacheRANDOMSTRING.p  pHowever, now I have run into a problem where Firefox is getting stuck in a redirect loop because of the cachebuster string on a clients server. So I did some searching and read that its not the best method of uncaching data.p  pDoes anyone have experience in this arena Would like to hear your thoughts on the matter..p  pEDIT more info The webapp cannot communicate to the host server apart from the SCORM API which is limited to data about the app. It may not be able to communicate to a third party server as it could be within an intranet too. Basically, the host server loads the index file, then my app does its thing. It loads a structure file which has info about the app and has the updated cachebuster string essentially this is a version string as mentioned by dferraro below.p

Negative 59458 pIn my app there are textfields in a different view and are all part of one array but there are several arrays with different textfield values. For example,there may be a 2 in the first textfield and a 5 in the second in one array but then a 6 in the first textfield and a 4 in the second in another array. When you click the saveAs button it will take you to the NameSaveAsView where theres another textfield. This textfield will give a name to that array so that when you go into the OpenShiftView you see each name in a tableview cell and can load up the array you want.

Negative 59458 pMy issue deals specifically with binary data not being sent properly via an RPC in gSOAP.  Im restricted to storing the binary as a stdstring.  In most cases, only a small fraction of the intended binary data is sent over the wire.  I believe it is because gSOAP cant handle certain characters properly that are contained within the populated stdstring.p  pMy gSOAP client application is required to send a corresponding gSOAP server application a few different binary files, including an RPM of a 3rd party application.  After the xml to h and cpp conversion process, I am restricted to the autogenerated C interface.  I am providing the class below.p  pThe programUpdate class looks something like thisp  precodeclass SOAPCMAC ns1setProgramUpdate  public     stdstring programPatch     struct soap soap     ....  codepre  pTherefore, I am restricted to storing the binary data as a stdstring.

I have searched how to do so with reflection, and Ive came up with this solutionp  precode    Private Function ObtainVehicleTypes As IEnumerableOf Type         Dim types As IEnumerableOf Type               Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly.GetTypes.WhereFunctiont              t.GetInterfaceIVehicle IsNot Nothing         Return types     End Function codepre  pWith those types, I fill the ComboBox like this, which also works finep  precodePrivate Sub AddTypesOfVehicles     Dim types As IEnumerableOf Type  ObtainVehicleTypes     For Each t As Type In types         ComboBox1.Items.Addt.Name     Next End Sub codepre  pThe problem is that, when I try to retrieve the item selected by the user and obtain the type asociated like shown below, I get Nothing, since the String doesnt contain the AssemblyName, only the Class namep  precodePrivate Sub Button1ClickByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs Handles Button1.Click         Dim type As Type  TryCastComboBox1.SelectedItem, Type Here I get Nothing         Dim v As IVehicle  TryCastActivator.CreateInstancetype, IVehicle         v.SayType End Sub codepre  pI have also tried to to add this to the comboboxp  precodeFor Each t As Type In types    ComboBox1.Items.Addt Adding the type, not only its name. Next codepre  pBut then it displays the AssemblyName to the user, which I want to avoid.p  pSo, the question is... how would you do to show the classes to the user and the retrieve them correctly to instantiate an object of the chosen classp  pstrongThe 2nd questionstrong Do you consider this as a good approach Would you suggest something simpler p  pThanksp

This works, except for highlighting the cell, it does in fact scroll to the cell selects it, as it shows in the details view iPad splitview setup, but the cell will not highlight.  This is a reuse issue because if the cell that needs to be scrolled to is one of the first cells that are visible at load, it will highlight but if its a cell thats off screen and it scrolls to that cell it will select but not highlight it.p  pETA cell reuse overridep  precode voidprepareForReuse   [super prepareForReuse]  self.selectionStyle  UITableViewCellSelectionStyleNone cellEditing  NO swipingToDelete  NO editViewAnimated  NO  codepre

Negative 59458 pI have situation where I have an MKMapView that takes up the full view of my xib file. Over the top of this at the left hand side of the xib I have a tableView. p  pIm adding a number of annotations to my map, which is fine, and then the map is centered so these are all in view. The problem I have is that the map is centered based on the size of the whole view. What I would like to do is center the region in the visible part of the map  so basically add an offset that is the size of the tableViews frame. The reason the mapView takes up the whole size of the view is that the tableView can be dismissed so the user views the map full screen.

Negative 59458 pI am just getting into Jquery and I am stuck on a little bit of a bug. In my HTML I generate some H tags and Labels.

My bug is that after I click on 2 elements it will change to whatever was in the input on both.

I am curious on how I could rearrange my code to make what ever you element you click on.

Negative 59458 pI have built ffmpeg library for my Android device from here a hrefhttpsgithub.comappuniteAndroidFFmpeg relnofollowhttpsgithub.comappuniteAndroidFFmpega. But some video files playing very very slow i find out that very slow are playing videos which my Android device can play by itself. Here is build.sh script a hrefhttpsgithub.comappuniteAndroidFFmpegblobmasterFFmpegLibraryjnibuildandroid.sh relnofollowhttpsgithub.comappuniteAndroidFFmpegblobmasterFFmpegLibraryjnibuildandroid.shap  pMay be this is because of these linesp  precodeenablehwaccelh264vaapi  enablehwaccelh264vaapi  enablehwaccelh264dxva2  enablehwaccelmpeg4vaapi  codepre  pAs I have understood these lines are enabling hw acceleration the author of that code says that this can raise some bugs. The basic idea of the player is to decode video and audio streams in native code, then render video frame into AndroidBitmap and render Audio into Android MediaPlayer.  Does anyone know how to solve problem of slow video decoding maybe decrease video frame resolution or something else I will be pleased for any help and ideas.p

Negative 59458 pI have a client application that receives video stream from a server via UDP or TCP socket.p  pOriginally, when it was written using .NET 2.0 the code was using BeginReceiveEndReceive and IAsyncResult.  The client displays each video in its own window and also using its own thread for communicating with the server. However, since the client is supposed to be up for a long period of time, and there might be 64 video streams simultaneously, there is a memory leak of IAsyncResult objects that are allocated each time the data receive callback is called.p  pThis causes the application eventually to run out of memory, because the GC cant handle releasing of the blocks in time. I verified this using VS 2010 Performance Analyzer.p  pSo I modified the code to use SocketAsyncEventArgs and ReceiveFromAsync UDP case. However, I still see a growth in memory blocks atp  precodeSystem.Net.Sockets.Socket.ReceiveFromAsyncclass System.Net.Sockets.SocketAsyncEventArgs codepre  pIve read all the samples and posts about implementing the code, and still no solution.p  pHeres how my code looks likep  precode class data members private byte[] mBuffer  new byte[UInt16.MaxValue] private SocketAsyncEventArgs mReadEventArgs  null private IPEndPoint mEndPoint  local endpoint from the caller codepre  pstrongInitializingstrongp  precodemSocket  new SocketAddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Dgram, ProtocolType.Udp mSocket.BindmEndPoint mSocket.SetSocketOptionSocketOptionLevel.Socket, SocketOptionName.ReceiveBuffer, MAXSOCKETRECVBUFFER    initalize the socket event args structure.   mReadEventArgs  new SocketAsyncEventArgs mReadEventArgs.Completed  new EventHandlerltSocketAsyncEventArgsgtreadEventArgsCompleted mReadEventArgs.SetBuffermBuffer, 0, mBuffer.Length mReadEventArgs.RemoteEndPoint  new IPEndPointIPAddress.Any, 0 mReadEventArgs.AcceptSocket  mSocket codepre  pstrongStarting the read processstrongp  precodebool waitForEvent  mSocket.ReceiveFromAsyncmReadEventArgs if waitForEvent      readEventArgsCompletedthis, mReadEventArgs  codepre  pstrongRead completion handlerstrongp  precodeprivate void readEventArgsCompletedobject sender, SocketAsyncEventArgs e      if e.BytesTransferred  0  e.SocketError  SocketError.Success                        we got error on the socket or connection was closed                  Close         return             try                  try to process a new video frame if enough data was read           base.ProcessPacketmBuffer, e.Offset, e.BytesTransferred            catch Exception ex                  log and error             bool willRaiseEvent  mSocket.ReceiveFromAsynce       if willRaiseEvent                readEventArgsCompletedthis, e        codepre  pBasically the code works fine and I see the video streams perfectly, but this leak is a real pain.p  pDid I miss anythingp  pMany thanksp

Negative 59458 pWe have a requirement to create a number of real time processing chains one running at n Hz and others running at x, y and z Hz in a single process. Where x, y and z are some multiple not necessarily a simple multiple of n. For example one chain running at 1Hz and others running at 3Hz and 4Hz. Each processing chain needs to make use of TBB to parallelize some of their computations etc. and so needs to have a pool of TBB worker threads that match the number of hardware processors, but the higher frequency chains need to preempt the lower frequency chains in order for the system to work. How can this be achieved using TBBp  pIt seems from the documentation that it is not possible to create competing pools of TBB workers that will preempt each other, since TBBs task groups etc. seem to share a single pool of real threads and there does not appear to be anyway to set the real system priority of a TBB worker thread, or am I missing somethingp

Lets assume the package name is  myapp1.2.3r2435.tar.gzp  pstrongQuestionstrong p  pHow do I send to the buildslave steps the required to build up the very same package name, so that the buildslave can upload the package Specifically I need to know the version number but I guess this could be any param p  pstrongImplemented and working solutionstrong The makefile, once the compilation process is completed, writes a file with the required param. The slave uses the SetProperty step to read the content of the file into a custom named property Once I have the value of interest in the property lets say APPVERSION I use it to build the package name with the same pattern used by the build system.p  pThe described solution works, but I do not really like it becausep  p1 its complicated, hence, I guess, fragilep  p2 it is not OS independent I use echo VAR  file to write the file, and cat file to read it and set the buildslave Propertyp  pIs there in your opinion a better way to solve this issue Do you have any suggestion to make the solution OS independent It will not work for sure on Windows, while my package shoudl be built on Windows OS toop

Negative 59458 pI am new to vba and macros in Access and this is my first time posting a question online.  I am using Access 2013.  I have searched a variety of online resources for my answer.  I thought the SendKeys command was the answer, but it is not working for me.  Im not sure what I am doing wrong.  Below outlines what I am trying to accomplish and the steps of the code that arent working as I intended.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Thank you.  p  pPurpose Once per quarter, my client will receive an updated access database.  All table names should be identical each quarter.  I want them to be able to simply run a macro, specify the location of the new file, and then the macro updates the linked tables and executes all other queries Ive built I have the last part working.  So, the part I have not be able to get working is to check the Always prompt for a new location box, check the select all box and click OK and then click OK and close after the client specifies the new file location.  Below is the code I am using.p  blockquote precodeFunction OpenLinkedTableManager  DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdLinkedTableManager this step works fine  the following lines, up until Application.Run dont appear to be doing anything.

Negative 59458 pI am trying to segment a video into foreground and background. Assuming that my video has primarily the face, I start with a face detector and use all pixels inside the face detector as a probably foreground seed for GrabCut. p  pThe problem is that at timesin a few frames, the face detector will not detect a face, although a face is definitely there. Specially when the user looks away from the screen and a side profile of the face is visible. p  pIs there a solution to this p  pAn obvious answer that came to my mind as well was to use the side profile Haar Classifier, but how do I fuse  both of them In the sense, at any point of time I should either have the front profile of the face or side profile or none at all. p  pI was wondering if there are any sort of associated confidence values with the detected faces and hence I can use the detection from the cascade which gives a more confident detection.p

Negative 59458 pIm creating an app that has to store historical financial data for various stocks. I currently have a stock table where the columns are stock symbol, stockname along with numerical data which Im trying to decide how to store.p  pFor example, for the column stockprice, I want to store an entire hash where the key is the date as a string and the value is the stock price. This information should be easily accessiblefast random access. Ive read a bit about serializing, but I wonder if this is the best optionor if its even applicable at all. Is there a way to instead automatically generate an sqlite table for each stock entered and create columns representing the date and rows representing the stockpricep  pI appreciate all insight into this matter and perhaps some clarification on whether this is exactly where I should use serialization or whether there is a better alternativep  pEDIT 1 Is ActiveModel Serialization relevant a hrefhttprailscasts.comepisodes409activemodelserializers relnofollowhttprailscasts.comepisodes409activemodelserializersap  pEDIT 2 Is it advisable to consider instead creating a Stockprice model amp table where the model belongsto a stock and a stock hasmany stockprices.

Negative 59458 pWell, I found the problem I was facing with the post back earlier. Somehow it turns out that drop down list, is failing event validation in all the pages. It wasnt failing validation earlier, so no idea what happened. p  pAnyway, now I have some 400 pages where this thing is happening. So, adding some code in all of them is out of question. So, now I want to know what I can do to get the drop down list considered as valid during the postback Adding update panel is out of question as I will have to do it on oh so many pages.p  pEditp  pMore detailsp  pI have an application created in .Net 1.1. I ran the upgrade wizard in VS to upgrade to VS2012. Since then, I am finding a lot of bugs when post back happens. I had two functions for handling click event for buttons. The javascript function used for validation is fired properly, but the asp function wasnt called at all. p  pSo, last week, I set eventvalidation to false, and everything worked. After reading more about it, I realised that postback was failing validation check. I checked eventtarget attribute, but that was null. So, I kept looking further. After a lot of head scratching, I finally found the culprit of that postback failure. p  pIn that application, we add items to the dropdown, based on database query results. So, it is modified on run time. The script modifying the control is added to ClientScriptManager, but that doesnt work. So, right now, my code has some 400 forms with dozens of dropdownlist created in runtime.p  pI have to get these dropdownlist removed from postback validation, or somehow return true for the validation. And thats where lies the problem. I have no idea how to do this. p  pP.S. Do let me know, which piece of code I should add here, if needed.  p

Negative 59458 pI am loading data in bulk in titan db v0.5. I have mixed index backed by elasticsearch v1.2.1. I am loading roughly 400k vertices of same label and can see these in titan db but when I query in ES using mixed index, I do not see those many. I hardly see little over 50k out of those 400k. p  pWhile loading I have no error whatsoever coming from ES. This kind of behavior of missing data in ES index, I have noticed randomly with earlier loading too.p  pI am wondering if someone also has encountered this weird problem. Folks dealing with TitanES, do you happen to see this data loss in ES p

Negative 59458 pSome cryptographic functions require a consistent execution duration to avoid timing attacks. I read that such functions targeting x86 are hard to write for reasons potentially including the emulated nature of the ISA and outoforder processing. Therefore preventing timing attacks on the x86 is not easy because it depends on complex, andor unknown factors in any given moment.p  pIn a standard RISCV core, are instruction timings predictably consistent relative to each another What about in the case of a standard core with outoforder processing or proprietary implementations of the base ISAp

Negative 59458 pI created a SSIS package in BIDS that pulls data from a sharepoint list and inserts it into a strongSQL Serverstrong database using OLE DB Destination.  This SSIS package works perfectly, and data is being populated.  I then needed to pull data from a different SharePoint list on the same site.  p  pI am using the exact same credentials, same readwrite access, and almost identical SSIS packages.  However, on this new SSIS package, there are 0 records being loaded.p  pThere are no errors or warnings in the execution results page.  To ensure there is not some setting I missed, I copied the data flow task from the working SSIS package into the SSIS package that is not loading any records.  p  pThe data flow task that I just copied pulls information from its SharePoint List as expected, so I know there is not some setting that I am missing.p  pAny thoughts about why this is happening  Google hasnt been much help on this and I am stumped.  p  pThe execution results page says p  precode[SharePoint List Source] Information Loaded 0 records from list LISTNAME at SITEURL.

Negative 59458 pIm trying to use Google Play Services with a Titanium module, and am running into an issue. First, a bit of background.

The error I get is as followsp  precode[ERROR] TiApplication main [274,274] Sending event exception on thread main msgjava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError Failed resolution of LcomgoogleandroidgmsRstyle Titanium 3.4.0,20140925 1642,b54c467 [ERROR] TiApplication java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError Failed resolution of LcomgoogleandroidgmsRstyle [ERROR] TiApplication  at com.google.android.gms.wallet.fragment.WalletFragmentStyle.ZUnknown Source [ERROR] TiApplication  at com.google.android.gms.wallet.fragment.WalletFragmentOptions.ZUnknown Source [ERROR] TiApplication  at com.google.android.gms.wallet.fragment.SupportWalletFragment.onCreateUnknown Source [ERROR] TiApplication  at android.support.v4.app.Fragment.performCreateFragment.java1477 [ERROR] TiApplication  at android.support.v4.app.FragmentManagerImpl.moveToStateFragmentManager.java904 [ERROR] TiApplication  at android.support.v4.app.FragmentManagerImpl.moveToStateFragmentManager.java1115 [ERROR] TiApplication  at android.support.v4.app.BackStackRecord.runBackStackRecord.java682 [ERROR] TiApplication  at android.support.v4.app.FragmentManagerImpl.execPendingActionsFragmentManager.java1478 [ERROR] TiApplication  at android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity.onStartFragmentActivity.java570 [ERROR] TiApplication  at org.appcelerator.titanium.TiBaseActivity.onStartTiBaseActivity.java1077 [ERROR] TiApplication  at android.app.Instrumentation.callActivityOnStartInstrumentation.java1220 [ERROR] TiApplication  at android.app.Activity.performStartActivity.java5949 [ERROR] TiApplication  at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivityActivityThread.java2261 [ERROR] TiApplication  at android.app.ActivityThread.handleLaunchActivityActivityThread.java2360 [ERROR] TiApplication  at android.app.ActivityThread.access800ActivityThread.java144 [ERROR] TiApplication  at android.app.ActivityThreadH.handleMessageActivityThread.java1278 [ERROR] TiApplication  at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessageHandler.java102 [ERROR] TiApplication  at android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java135 [ERROR] TiApplication  at android.app.ActivityThread.mainActivityThread.java5221 [ERROR] TiApplication  at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNative Method [ERROR] TiApplication  at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java372 [ERROR] TiApplication  at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.runZygoteInit.java899 [ERROR] TiApplication  at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.mainZygoteInit.java694 [ERROR] TiApplication Caused by java.lang.ClassNotFoundException Didnt find class com.google.android.gms.Rstyle on path DexPathList[[zip file dataappredactedbase.apk],nativeLibraryDirectories[dataappredactedlibarm, vendorlib, systemlib]] [ERROR] TiApplication  at dalvik.system.BaseDexClassLoader.findClassBaseDexClassLoader.java56 [ERROR] TiApplication  at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClassClassLoader.java511 [ERROR] TiApplication  at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClassClassLoader.java469 [ERROR] TiApplication  ... 23 more [ERROR] TiApplication  Suppressed java.lang.ClassNotFoundException com.google.android.gms.Rstyle [ERROR] TiApplication      at java.lang.Class.classForNameNative Method [ERROR] TiApplication      at java.lang.BootClassLoader.findClassClassLoader.java781 [ERROR] TiApplication      at java.lang.BootClassLoader.loadClassClassLoader.java841 [ERROR] TiApplication      at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClassClassLoader.java504 [ERROR] TiApplication      ... 24 more [ERROR] TiApplication  Caused by java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError Class not found using the boot class loader no stack available codepre  pThe only way I know of fixing this is modifying the SDK Im using to use TiRHelper.getResource on all of its resource calls.

Negative 59458 pI guess the title is pretty straightforward, what impact does declaring variables as variants, instead of a specific datatype, has on performance in VBA p  pMaybe its because I am not that experienced with programming, but intuitively it should decrease performance due to the computer having to check which datatype is assigned, and then changing the variant to the assigned datatype, instead of immediately assigning the value to it. I have not been able to find some literature on this.p

Negative 59458 pI have what seems to be a unique situation that Im trying to wrap my head around. I inherited a project that uses Hibernate, something that Ive had almost no experience with. p  pIve done a fair bit of research and I think I understand at least the basics of a Hibernate application but there is one thing that is bugging me. p  pThe project that Im working on uses a custom class that will query the database and store the returned objects in an ArrayList in the scope of a single session. If I understand this correctly, the objects in the list are no longer persistent detached since the session no longer exists. The application then uses these arraylists caches to populate the page. When changes are made by the user, a new session is opened and closed to handle the changes. Therefore, each session has exactly one transaction.p  pI am wondering if this is a good programming model to follow. The application takes approximately 3  10 seconds to respond to any change made and Im thinking that its related to the way that the data is handled. p  pAny help is appreciated and thanks in advancep  pEDIT Additionally, almost every single relationship mapping is set to lazyfalse. Again, Im new to Hibernate but this seems excessive to me, especially considering the size that the database will eventually reach when it goes to production. Actually, there are already a couple of tables with 5000 rows, so that gives you an idea of what Im dealing with. p
Negative 59458 pIn a project Im working on I need to use a bunch of C functions from Go. The current implementation is using cgo to achieve that, but doing so has a massive performance impact, which I am trying to remove.p  ul licgo marks all C code as a syscall, causing the scheduler to allocate a new thread if needed. Since 80 of the CPU time in my project is spent doing the heavy C work, this quickly results in having a lot of threads 500 instead of codeGOMAXPROCScode  8, which my Linux kernel does not like much.li liDoing the usual limiter approach have a buffered channel lock the cgo calls results in a lot of mutexes, slowing the program down.li ul  pI want to keep using Go for this project as its a great way of managing concurrency.p  pThings I have tried p  ul liComment out some stuff like codeentersyscallcode in codesrcruntimecgocall.gocode didnt seem to help much, and Id prefer to avoid modifying the Go code.li liPut my code in a .c file and call it from Go, without the codeimport Ccode. No luck here  I couldnt call the function and when I wrote the function names as codepackagefunctioncode the compiler complained about invalid characters in the file.li liUse a .s file and just write it as assembly. My asm isnt that great and I couldnt figure it out.li ul  pSo, my question is emhow does one use C functions from Go while avoiding the overhead of cgoemp  pSide note Im aware of why cgo marks all calls as a syscall, but in this specific case the functions I call do not block on locks or IO.p

decode more than 2 video files on  Galaxy S3 2 videos play just fine.p  pIve tested the same code on HTC OneX4.1.x amp LG Nexus4 4.2.x and they play even 6 videos at a time without an issue.p  pAny ideas what the issue is p  pstrongEDIT  1strongp  pThe problem is mainly with software codecs, the codecs I get for my mimetype are 3 hardware and 1 software namely, OMX.SEC.avc.dec, OMX.SEC.avcdec, OMX.SEC.AVC.Decoder amp OMX.google.h264.decoder respectively. OMX.SEC.avc.dec only manages to decode 1 video and other videos get OMX.google.h264.decoder as their decoder other 2 are useless in my case.p  pIve also tested the app on Nexus5Lollipop, Xiaomi Mi3KitKat amp Galaxy S4KitKat with absolutely no issue, as these devices manage to successfully allocate 6 hardware codecs for decoding.p

Once the same sounds start to play for the second time before the audio file ends, it creates this weird effect where it sounds like its skipping every other note or so.

I got it to load and play the instrument, but for some reason my exs file wasnt finding the sample files. It would load the sampler and say, unable to load kick1.wav, or snare1.wav. Not sure if maybe I exported my exs wrong.p

Negative 59458 pIve implemented the subscriptions purchases in my Android app and everything works well except that I dont get a valid expiry date when I verify the status of a subscription.

Negative 59458 pHi guys Im having some difficulty finding how to do the following. I need to have a column add 1 to every cell below the starting cell say codeA1code every second since a time has passed say code130000code in cell codeB1code. Consider every cell in column codeAAcode is blank I need to either use excel or vba to put a 1 to the cell below , every second, as already mentioned. So  after a minute I will have the below up to 60 starting the count from A2p  precodeA 0 1 2 3 . . . ... 60 codepre  puntil I specify stop in a cell e.g. codec1code having code130100code or codeD1code having code130100code and codeC1code having codeSTOPcodep  pI would prefer to do this with excel formulas but I am not sure if it will be efficient since I will have up to nine column doing this at the same time and they will run from a few minutes to a few hours, possibly days.  So a UDF would probably be better  I will probably need to test both methodsp  pOnce the time has stopped I need all the cells in the column to be put back to blank including the code0code p  hr  pWhat I am actually doing is find the lowest low or lowst high frm the point in time when I opened a trade with a program called multicharts refering to its DDE connectoin formulas. The last input is the time since in any period I like as long as it is present in multicharts. I can have 1 second  5 seconds  10 minutes.  The formulas are like  codeRTDmcrtdserver.rtdserver,localhost,Symbol,EURUSD,1 Second,SymbolData,High,0code where the 0 is the present 1 second or it can be present 5 minutes. Hence I can use the 1 and 2 to find the data from 2 seconds ago up to however many seconds ago I opened the trade. Essentially Im looking for the most practical way then to refer to these formulas to find the minimum or maximum of the high  low. Low formula is just  codeRTDmcrtdserver.rtdserver,localhost,Symbol,EURUSD,1 Second,SymbolData,Low,0code where it is more practical to work in 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes and hours as they will be present in multicharts quite frequently.  I am just trying to get my head round how best to do this  whether it would be a vlookup table with time from  time until using some intervals to hone in on the larger time frame or something else. I would then try to paste.value the minimum or maximum value of the high  lows recorded before clearing the column to make use of the value so that bit isnt so important right now. p

Negative 59458 pI have a network call that depends on the inputs of multiple UI elements. Its basically an interface for a transaction, where the user can pick things like the amount, currency, and destination. Before the request is fired off, I need to verify everything for example, whether or not the users balance has the amount, whether or not the destination is valid, etc.. I have codeObservablecodes for all of these network calls, but Im not sure what the best way to go about starting all of these calls concurrently and using their results to determine what action to take.p  pBasically, the ideal flow is for each condition to have a failure case which I can determine in code for each, and if any of those failure cases are met, display an error to the user saying which inputs were invalid. If all of the checks pass, fire off the transaction.p  pHow should I go about thisp

Negative 59458 pSimple version of this question stronghow can I tell if a user is authenticated through Facebook after they are logged in with ASP.NET Identitystrongp  pVS2013, ASP.NET SPA Template, ASP.NET Identity 2.2.1p  pId like to know if a user authenticated via Facebook. I was previously able to do this callp  precodeExternalLoginData externalLogin  ExternalLoginData.FromIdentityUser.Identity as ClaimsIdentity codepre  pinside of my GetExternalLogin method. Now, though, it works the first time when called from GetExternalLogin returning an object describing the facebook login but upon returning form the postback to Facebook, its called again from my GetUserInfo method and it returns null. I dug into the code, and found the offending linep  precodeif providerKeyClaim.Issuer  ClaimsIdentity.DefaultIssuer      return null  codepre  pThe value for both of these things is LOCAL AUTHORITY and null is returned.p  pIn the instance when it works correctly, providerKeyClaim.Issuer  Facebook. Can anyone explain what this check is for, and why this condition is being met despite a Facebook login I wish I knew when it last worked for me. I updated my version of ASP.NET Identity though Im not sure if it worked after.p  pUpdate Looks like during the call to GetExternalLogin, the User.Identity object was issued by Facebook. But for the subsequent GetUserInfo call, its an entirely separate locally generated object, generated by the ASP.NET Identity components.p

I have a scenario that is extremely simple using frames but I cant make it work using Autolayout. p  pI have a StoryBoard I cant touch because it belongs to a library. When the ViewController related to the storyboard loads I want to programmatically add a View. So I created a codeUIViewcode in the codeviewDidLoadcode, added the constraints for height and width and also two other constraints to position them. Everything worked fine BUT the width, I want to have the same width as an other view. How should I do thisp  pI logged the size of the other view in the codeviewDidLoadcode and the size is not right, I also logged the codeself.view.frame.size.widthcode, and is not correct either.p  pI read that the correct sizes are not set until codeviewDidLayoutSubviewscode, so I tried to add my code there but I get in a loop of calls to codeviewDidLayoutSubviewscode that never ends.

Negative 59458 pWell as you know that when Apache acts like a we server it can access its local folder. But when Apache is a proxy server then nowhere means it can access its local folder even though if the document root is set to htdocs. Apache doesnt says anything about this thing. Please guide me if anybody had resolved this. Thanks you.p
Negative 59458 pI am using CanvasJS in my site to show statistics of physical items all data points are integers. Is there a way to customize the scaling of the chart so that when only a single data point is shown, the yAxis scaling does not show decimals.p  pI have also noticed, with plotting a single item at x  0, y  1, the XAxis decides to plot the point in the middle with a tick mark on either side showing 1 and 1.

Negative 59458 pI have a report in Microsoft Access 97 yes, I know that works properly on my clients copy of Server 2003. However, when I try to run it on my own copy of Server 2003, the report crashes Access immediately. It does the same in Server 2008 R2 and Server 2012 R2. Now, the interesting thing is that the query underneath that report runs perfectly, which I would think rules out things like MDAC. Theres nothing unusual about the report  no strange fonts or graphics  at least nothing obvious. If I can get it working in an environment identical to the clients, then I can move it forward to other operating systems. Where should I start looking for the causep

Negative 59458 pI have the requirement to pass an arguments string from one batch file to another for execution at the command line.  Say we have a batch file which takes its arguments i.e. the command tail and creates another batch file that emexecutesem those arguments.  Consider file Batch1.batp  precodeecho gtBatch2.bat call Batch2.bat codepre  pIf we run this withp  precodeBatch1.bat echo a b c codepre  pwe getp  precodea b c codepre  pwhich is fine.  But if we run it withp  precodeBatch1.bat echo 1 2 3  codepre  pwe getp  precode1 2 codepre  pI guess because the last argument code3code gets interpreted by batch as an operator for the following codegtcode redirection character.   I know a simple fix would be to add a space, as inp  precodeecho  gtBatch2.bat codepre  pbut there are occasions when the command line cannot have a trailing space, likep  precodeBatch1 set NoEnv codepre  pwill give you an environment variable with a value of one space character, instead of deleting the environment variable.p  pSo how do I do this  the requirement is to have a batch file which faithfully executes its command tail which might include items in quotes, as well as numerals p

Negative 59458 pSO Ive reached an impasse regarding codedesign. Heres the scenario.p  pI am required to either copy, move or delete files. OK, sure, no problem. I can easily write it like this.p  precodepublic class SimpleFileManager      public void copyString sourcePath, String targetPath  ...      public void moveString sourcePath, String targetPath  ...      public void deleteString filePath  ...   codepre  pand call it from a client code in a manner like this, for examplep  precodepublic static void mainString[] args      ...     fileManager.copyx, y     ...  codepre  pHowever, a request arises that some particular POJOs which have the FileManager reference perform specific operations, depending on some configuration. The actual specification of which POJO instance should do what is contained in config.p  pHeres an example of what I meanp  precodepublic static void mainString[] args      ...     InvokerPojo invokerPojo1  new InvokerPojoinvokerPojo1Config, fileManager  this config tells it to copy files only     InvokerPojo invokerPojo2  new InvokerPojoinvokerPojo2Config, fileManager  this config tells it to move files only     InvokerPojo invokerPojo3  new InvokerPojoinvokerPojo3Config, fileManager  this config tells it to delete files only  codepre  pSo, FileManager provides the functionality to do actual operations, while InvokerPojo simply invokes and delegates those methods based on config.p  pHowever, I do not want to be coupled to FileManager, because, for example, I may find some library that provides the same functionality but is much better than mine.p  pSo, I was thinking something like thisp  precodepublic interface FileManagerDelegator      void copyString sourcePath, String targetPath     void moveString sourcePath, String targetPath     void deleteString filePath   public class MyFileManagerDelegator implements FileManagerDelegator      private SimpleFileManager simpleFileManager      void copyString sourcePath, String targetPath   delegate to simpleFileManager      void moveString sourcePath, String targetPath   delegate to simpleFileManager      void deleteString filePath   delegate to simpleFileManager    public class ComplexFileManagerDelegator implements FileManagerDelegator      private ComplexFileManager complexFileManager      void copyString sourcePath, String targetPath   delegate to complexFileManager      void moveString sourcePath, String targetPath   delegate to complexFileManager      void deleteString filePath   delegate to complexFileManager    public interface Command      void execute   public class CopyCommand      private FileManagerDelegator delegator     String sourcePath     String targetPath      void execute          delegator.copysourcePath, targetPath        public class MoveCommand      private FileManagerDelegator delegator     String sourcePath     String targetPath      void execute          delegator.movesourcePath, targetPath        public class DeleteCommand      private FileManagerDelegator delegator     String filePath      void execute          delegator.deletefilePath        public static void mainString[] args      ...     Command c  getCommandcontext     c.execute     ...  codepre  pNow, the problem is in actually creating that particular command, because I do not want to know which command is being created. All I know is there is info in context that creates it.p  pI was thinking about having a factory that would create the appropriate Command from context.p  pThe main issue arises in number of parameters for command.

Negative 59458 pAs I continue to learn how to build my sites in Angular, one issue Im having a lot of trouble with is how to get a view to behave a certain way based on the controller. p  pI have a site for playing penandpaper RPGs via playbypost. In PHP, I have a character class, which has some top level functions for display. I have other classes that extend from that class, based on the type of game, and sometimes classes extending from those.p  pOne example is that the vast majority of RPGs have stats. In a D20 based game, they tend to be a common set of six. In Savage World games theyre different. On my display, with PHP, I have a function called displayStats, and what it actually doesshows is different based on what child class calls it. In Angular, I can only think of doing this by having a bunch of different directives with different names, like codeltstatsd20gtcode or codeltstatssavageworldsgtcode, but its messy.p  pSo, like a class, can I have a directive codeltstatsgtcode thatll call something different based on different settings, other than putting in a bunch of codeifcode statements in the link function A friend mentioned that you can assign a controller to a directive, but I havent quite figured out how thatd helpp  pIn general, Im not seeing how to setup Angular code in a situation like this. Im not seeing how to use the techniquesmethods I learned through OOP here and Im guessing theyre not directly useful, and its kinda annoying. Here I have this really great working OOP code to display stuff, and Im struggling to think of how to do it without creating codeltreallycomplexdirectivenamesgtcode.

I currently have a JMeter script that will hit multiple pages on the site for many different users.p  pBetween tests I can switch out the Mongo connection, to different Mongod instances on different storage engines.

Negative 59458 pWhen using a SoundPool audio class, it definitely has some advantages over a MediaPlayer when just playing short audio clips. The two Ive noticed is SoundPool is a lot faster. MediaPlayer can lag a bit on startup and its much easier to go from one sound clip to the next, where I dont have to stop,reset,prepare each time. p  pHowever, is it possible to use the visualizer to get real time fft data from audio data playing in the SoundPool like it is for MediaPlayer I couldnt come across any topics that cover that, but by the off chance I thought I would ask because it seems like it should be possible. The documentation says, emThe SoundPool library uses the MediaPlayer service to decode the audio into a raw 16bit PCM mono or stereo stream.em So if I could reference the MediaPlayer that SoundPool is using then I think I could just use codegetAudioSessionIdcode perhaps p  pI already tried setting session ID to 0 to just get the output mix. It didnt work but its not really the ideal effect that I am looking for anyway. Also one of the first things I did was try using the loaded SoundPool SoundID in place of the visualizers session ID, but that also didnt work.p

I just wrote this in case you were either shocked by the idea of me trying to detect protected members andor curious about why I asked this question.p  pI was writing some kind of iterator template classes built out of other iterators and I got tired of writing multiple specializations depending on whether these iterators meet some requirements ForwardIterator, BidirectionalIterator, RandomAccessIterator... although my iterators actually meet some relaxed versions of these concepts, they are kind of proxy iterators but its not really relevant here. For instance, if I only use random access iterators, my new custom iterator could and should also be some kind of random access iterator, hence implement codeoperatorcode, codeoperatorcode, codeoperatorcode, codeoperatorcode, codeoperatorltcode, codeoperatorgtcode, codeoperatorltcode and codeoperatorgtcode. However, some of these operators can easily be deduced from others, and they should only be defined if all the iterator I use are random access iterators.p  pI finally thought Id just make something to provide default implementations if available. However, I wasnt really fond of the codestdallocatortraitscode way as it wouldnt be very handy and readable with iterators plus, I wouldnt be able to use them with some standard utilities.br The design I finally choose consists in having a template class which will build a fullfledged iterator out of a minimal implementation for instance containing only the codeoperatorcode, codeoperatorcode, codeoperatorcode and codeoperatorgtcode definitions by having an inheritance chain of mixins whose ancestor is my minimal iterator detecting whether the functionsmethods they need are available in their base class and defining the default methods if they are.br There is a subtility though. Sometimes I want to return a reference to the final iterator for instance in codeIteratoramp operatorcode. If its a method I redefine, I can easily solve that with CRTP and a codestaticcastcode, but what if my mixins dont touch that method at allbr I figured I should probably forbid the use of any method I havent touched and inherit my minimal iterator with the protected access specifier... but now then my traits fail to detect the availability of some protected methods.br Therefore, Id like to have traits able to detect whether some members are available with either public or protected visibility.p

Negative 59458 pIve generated a Webservice client using Axis 1. The webservice worked fine at first, but we have some problems with a specific method.p  pThere is a method to retrieve information about one item, and a method to retrieve information about several items. The first method requires a string id of the item, the second method requires a string[] wiht id to the items.p  pIve googled the problem and found this site which describes the problem we are having a hrefhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseAXIS2669 relnofollowhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseAXIS2669ap  pUnfortunatly I can not tell you which webservice this is about or disclose the wsdl, but Im hoping there is an Axis expert who can help me find a workaround or fix for this problem, preferably without changes to the webservice server since this is a third party.p  pKind regards,p

Negative 59458 pI am retrieving some data from server for around 500 objects and storing it in a HashMap and when all the data for 500 objects have been collected, I used to write it to simple plain text files as Strings using BuffrerdWriter. But I was getting OutOfMemoryError only in the last thread.p  pSo I decided to breakup data collection and rather than collecting data for 500 objects, I started collecting data for 50 objects at a time in a loop populating hashmap locally so that it can be garbage collected in the next iteration and kept BufferedWriter open for the whole time rather than opening and closing it in the end at once.p  pNow I am getting OutofMemoryError in more threads, rather than in just last thread.p  pNote The application is multithreaded and there are 510 threads each collecting data for 500 objects and having their own BUfferedWriter in their call method.p  precodepublic String call     BufferedWriter writer  new BufferedWriternew FileWriterfilename      try          ListltString[]gt objectList  sPoller.getobjectsKeyword.HTTP         forString[] objectNameArray  objectList             ifobjectNameArray.lengthgt0                 HashMapltString, TreeMapltLong, ArrayListltStringgtgtgt statMap  new HashMapltString, TreeMapltLong, ArrayListltStringgtgtgt                 HashMapltString, Stringgt objectMap  sPoller.getobjectNamesIDMap                                    code for getting data from server                                                                       code for populating hashmaps                                                              writeHTTPStatsstatMap              catchException e             e.printStackTrace     finally         writer.closeStream       codepre

I get on an iPhone 5 simulator 288 width for a no matter height.p  pBUT, in a copypaste of the view controller in the storyboard, I get a 304 width. The weirdest behavior is that with FLEX, and after the render, the collection view measures 288 pixels.p  pThe only difference is that the first view controller is just pushed, the second is contained in a UITabBarController.p  pPS  the first screen Im talking about are the 3rd amp 4th screenshots.p  pIf someone has an explication to this, Ill take it p  pUpdate 1 p  pIf I invalidate the collection view layout in  voidviewDidLayoutSubviews, items are correctly drawn BUT there is like a flash because the whole collection view is redrawn the header amp items below.p

Negative 59458 pI recently asked a question about why we use the 3 different image types listed above, and got gooddetailed responses.  It also lead me to question something else...p  pAssume I am working in XCode with SWIFT and have the three image sizes 1x, 2x, 3x for a particular say UIImage on an iPhone.  Now, I want it to look nice on iPad, so I add some scaling.  However, this will change the sizes of the 1x, 2x, 3x images I need for the iPad, so I need to make 3 more to compensate for that new size.  Now how will XCode differentiate between the two  Do I need to check what size screen I am using and then choose the imagesp  pI read that assets could help me, but that only deals with iPhone vs. iPad, what if I scale my images across iPhone 4, 5, 6 and iPad.  Thats a lot of different sizes and x images, and I read Apple doesnt like device checking so Im not sure how that would happen.p  pI hope this makes sense.  I get the 1x, 2x, 3x per device, but if my app is being designed for universal device use, then how do I manage all of these different sizes in code for the proper devicep
