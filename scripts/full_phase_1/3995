Positive 3995 pSome context Im using Bigcommerce which doesnt support PHP to design a storefront and want to allow users to add a product inside of the checkout page emwithoutem redirecting them to the cart page.  I know this is possible because on the front page, there are some preprogrammed buttons which are simply codelta hrefhttpsomestore.comcart.phpactionaddampproductid9001gtcode tags with some buttonlike styling.  These pull up a modal, and most importantly emadd the product to the cartem  both without redirect.p  pSo at first this struck me as a simple problem  just code.ajaxcode to the page and be done with it, but then I ran into the old codeAccessControlAllowOrigincode error, which is strange, since Im writing my Javascript on the same domain that Im trying to hit, only the subdomain is different cart vs checkout.  I decided to look deeper at the request made by this magical button.  The only Request Header which is not present on my own dysfunctional version of this request is codeXRequestedWithcode which I of course tried to add to my codeXMLHttpRequestcode unsuccessfully.p  pThe second thing I noticed was an extra URL paramter which wasnt originally listed in the source, codefastcart1code so I tried adding that, and was taken to a PHP page I obviously wasnt meant to see.  Its easily roughly 200 lines of spaghetti, and Im not sure I can post it here.  Its obvious that a script somewhere was taking this codehrefcode and using it to make a GET request, but how  Ive tried both codeXMLHttpRequestcode, and codeajaxcode, but both give me the codeAccessControlAllowOrigincode response.p  pIve seen the use of a technique where you disallow the redirect of the page on an codelta hrefgtcode by adding an code.clickfunctionecode to it, and calling either codereturn falsecode or codee.preventDefaultcode but these simply dont allow my codelta hrefgtcode to accomplish anything at all, let alone some ninja codeGETcode request.  My question is ultimately about why my own attempts at a codeGETcode request to this page have failed, when a simple codelta hrefgtcode has been able to bypass SOP and make the request almost in secret.p  pObviously Ill have to spend some more time looking at the PHP script I was taken to by the extra parameter.  Nevertheless, this has turned out to be a much bigger mystery than I had originally thought it would be, teaching me a lot along the way.  Unfortunately, I havent solved it yet, and I really need to get this functionality working.  If its helpful for me of the source on these requests, Ill be happy to, but for now Ive run out of time and have to get some rest. If some one with more web development experience can help, I would be extremely grateful  p

Negative 3995 pIm wondering how people handle a situation like this, when you have a validation event, and you need to show the user a dialog box asking him whether to continue or cancel.p  pThe problem is that when showing that dialog box, it causes another validation event because its considered losing focus on the control again, and you end up with an infinite loop of dialog popups.p  pI cant show the message box before or after the validation event either, because either the user hasnt finished editing the control, or the value has been already committed and rolling back would cause problems of its own.p  pWhat Im doing right now is setting a flag before showing the dialog and clearing it afterward, and then in the validation event function, check if the flag is set and if it is, skip the function. It works but is cumbersome and prone to programmer errors.p  pIs there some easier way to handle something like that p

Negative 3995 pWhen drawing child controls containing bitmaps with perpixel alpha channels, we are getting quite a lot of flickering whenever they need to be redrawn.  The actual blending is working correctly.  Ive found a lot of info about reducing flicker such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions197948reduceflickerwithgdiandcthis questiona or a hrefhttpwww.catch22.nettutsflicker relnofollowthis sitea, but I cant seem to find anything that applies specifically to this situation.p  pFor example, Ive got a button with a few different bitmaps that are alpha blended and blitted to the window, depending on the state of the button.  When their state changes and I need to draw a different bitmap, I need to redraw the background first, or else it blends with pixels left over from the previous states bitmap.  This is where I am getting some flickering, where I get a bit of the background tearing in occasionally.p  pThe problem is made more complicated by having the toplevel parent windows drawing a bitmap background, rather than a solid color, along with the possibility of having child controls overlapping just multiplying the underlying color into the childs bitmap is out of the question, as is using codeWSCLIPCHILDRENcode.p  pSince the windows have a bitmap background, Im returning codetruecode on codeWMERASEBKGNDcode, to avoid drawing a color that will just be overwritten.p  pOf course, double buffering would seem to solve all of this, but I have not been able to get it to work right.  Ive set codeWSCOMPOSITEDcode for toplevel windows, and codeWSTRANSPARENTcode for child windows.  When it comes time to redraw a child window with a new bitmap, I am having a few issues most likely from me not understanding how the draw order is working in this situationp  ul liIf I call codeInvalidateRectcode and pass the child handle, the child window is indeed redrawn, but the background is not redrawn, and so the pixels accumulate on top of each other, blending together.li liIf I call codeInvalidateRectcode and pass in the emparentem handle, with a rectangle consisting of the child windows dimensions, the background is redrawn, but the child window is not.li liIf I do both of the above, then the background is redrawn as well as the child window, and it looks exactly as Id want  except that by doing so, Ive managed to make it emflickerem again which isnt really surprising, since it seems terribly hackish to call codeInvalidateRectcode twice like that, as Id guess that each call is probably causing the buffers to flip, which defeats the purpose.li ul  pWhat Ive come to conclude is that I dont really understand how I need to modify my program to handle double buffering, or if double buffering will even help with this situation.  I feel like it definitely would, but I dont quite understand how I need to modify things to get everything to play nicely again.p

Negative 3995 pIm working on a web application that submits tasks to a masterworker system that farms out the tasks to any of a series of worker instances.  The work queue master runs as a separate process on a separate machine altogether and tasks are submitted to the master via HTTPREST requests.  Once tasks are submitted to the work queue, client applications can submit another HTTP request to get status information about tasks.p  pFor my web application, Id like it to provide some sort of progress bar view that gives the user some indication of how far along task processing has come.  The obvious way to implement this would be an AJAX progress meter widget that periodically polls the work queue for status on the tasks that have been submitted.  My question is, is there a better way to accomplish this without the frequent pollingp  pIve considered having the client web application open up a server socket on which it could listen for notifications from the work master.  Another similar thought Ive had is to use XMPP or a similar protocol for the status notifications.  Of course, the masterworker system would need to be updated to provide notifications either way but I own the code for that so can make any necessary updates myself.p  pAny thoughts on the best way to set up a notification system like this  Is the extra effort involved worth it, or is the simple polling solution the way to gop

Now Id like to introduce a new class a hrefhttppastebin.comf2d2ac7b3 relnofollowGroceryListJDOa, that references the ingredients owned by various recipes.  p  pWhen I try to persist a new codeGroceryListJDOcode I get the followingp  precodejavax.jdo.JDOException Duplicate property name ingredientsidOWN NestedThrowables org.datanucleus.exceptions.NucleusException Duplicate property name ingredientsidOWN javax.jdo.JDOException Duplicate property name ingredientsidOWN codepre  pSeems like there is an issue of ownership of the ingredients between codeRecipeJDOcode and codeGroceryListJDOcode.p  pI could probably change codeGroceryListJDOcode to merely contain a codeListltStringgtcode that acts as a kind of foreign key to codeIngredientsJDOcode, but that kind of defeats the purpose of using ORM Id have to manually fetch and attach the ingredients in my DAO.p  pstrongWhat is the best way to manage JDO collections that need to attach to multiple container JDO classesstrongp  pThis is with JDO on Google App Engine, FWIW.  p

Negative 3995 pIm currently working with the mapkit and am stuck.p  pI have a custom annotation view I am using, and I want to use the image property to display the point on the map with my own icon. I have this working fine. But what I would also like to do is to override the default callout view the bubble that shows up with the titlesubtitle when the annotation icon is touched. I want to be able to control the callout itself the mapkit only provides access to the left and right ancillary callout views, but no way to provide a custom view for the callout bubble, or to give it zero size, or anything else.p  pMy idea was to override selectAnnotationdeselectAnnotation in my codeMKMapViewDelegatecode, and then draw my own custom view by making a call to my custom annotation view. This works, but only when codecanShowCalloutcode is set to codeYEScode in my custom annotation view class. These methods are NOT called if I have this set to codeNOcode which is what I want, so that the default callout bubble is not drawn. So I have no way of knowing if the user touched on my point on the map selected it or touched a point that is not part of my annotation views delected it without having the default callout bubble view show up.p  pI tried going down a different path and just handling all touch events myself in the map, and I cant seem to get this working. I read other posts related to catching touch events in the map view, but they arent exactly what I want. Is there a way to dig into the map view to remove the callout bubble before drawing Im at a loss.p  pAny suggestions Am I missing something obviousp

Negative 3995 pI am creating a website which will contain both ASP.NET pages and a Flash applet.  I want to encapsulate my business logic in a WCF service which will be exposed through two endpoints  One accesssible over the Internet through HTTPS, for use by the Flash client, and one accessible within the data center for use by the application servers.  If this does not seem like a good approach, then stop me here otherwise, Ill move on...p  pThe question is how to authenticate requests coming from the Flash client.  Since I dont want to store the users password in a browser cookie, dont want to send the password with every request, and dont want to have to use HTTPS after the initial login, I plan on using a tokenbased authentication system.  I also dont want the user to have to log into the Flash client after already logging into the site itself, so I plan on using Javascript to pass the token to the Flash client when it starts.p  pI know WCF supports using the .NET Frameworks builtin security framework System.Security to enforce access control, and I would like to take advantage of this.p  pThe question, then, is  bHow do I pass the token to the WCF service when it is called by Flash, and how do I process the token on the serverbp  ul liWCF has an issued token authentication mode, but it appears this is intended to be used in a fullblown federation scenario with a Secure Token Service and SAML tokensa bit more complexity that I really want.  It is possible to use this mode with my own simple randomstring tokens  If so, how  Keep in mind this needs to be compatible with Flash.li liI could potentially pass the token in a header either a SOAP header or an HTTP header.  In this case, once Ive determined which user is making the request, how do I inform the framework so that the System.Security checks will workli liIs there a different approach altogether that I should consider  Anything that avoids sending passwords in every request, lets me use System.Security, and works with Flash is a possibility.li ul

Negative 3995 pTrying to copy a cookie from second.com to first.com, with full control of both domains.p  pPreviously an iFrame was used, however this is not able to work across all browsers as it touched on thirdparty cookies which are hard to implement and impossible in Safari and Chrome.p  pThe new approach uses a SCRIPT tag pointing to second.com and included in the HEAD of first.com. The serverside script is actually a piece of Java which reads the cookies sent with the request the cookies from second.com and the JavaScript returned executes on first.com and essentially duplicates the cookie here. This is working great in all browsers except IE, where IE appears to not be sending the second.com cookies with SCRIPT request, so the Java is not able to pickup the cookie value from second.com.p  pThis is surely to do with IE security settings as when I put privacy to the lowest level it is working, but my question is why are the cookies being blocked at all I thought the SCRIPT tag was not subject to the same origin policy that AJAX and other technologies have to comply with.p  pAny solution to this without heading down the P3P privacy policy routep

Negative 3995 pI set the BackColor of specific TreeNodes in a TreeView as a hint to the user that something interesting has happened to the node while they are using the application.  However, when I set BackColor, it causes the entire parent TreeView control to redraw rather than just the label area of the specific TreeNode that has been changed.  I am not calling Refresh or Update at any point  just setting BackColor on the TreeNode.  It seems that rather than just invalidating the bounds of the TreeNode that has been changed, the TreeView is refreshing its entire area.  This results in an annoying quick flash of the control.  p  pAny idea why this happening and if it can be easily stoppedp

Negative 3995 pIm new to anonymous classes, and today I think I ran into the first case where I felt like I could really use them.

I like to put assign things like calculations to temporary variables, so that during debugging I can verify bits of calculations at a time in logical chunks.  Then I want to assign something simpler to the final value.  This value would be in the anonymous class.p  pThe problem is that in order to implement my code with anonymous classes concisely, Id like to use LINQ.

However I am unsure quite how to then map these textures on to my tilemap.p  pI understand the process of specifiying vertices and then coordinates of where on the texture map I wish to take them from i drew a picture toop  pa hrefhttpimages.redial.netHmm.jpg relnofollowClick for image  curse newbies not allowed to post images ap  pBut my question is can I draw a triangle strip that is, in effect, longer than one tile but map a different area of the texture to that tile.p  pSo instead of drawing a triangle strip pretending to be a quad, one at a time for each tile, can I somehow draw a whole row of the tilemap like 1,2,3,4 and cleverly shift around the texture coordinates so each tile is now from a different area of the texture So for example I draw a triangle strip 4 tiles long but shift the texture coordinates so the first tile is the yellow of my texture the second red ... third blue... etcp  pIf Ive not explained myself too well apologiesp  pIt might just be that this is not possible and I have to draw each one individually which seems like Ive saved effort with an atlas, then had to draw them all out slowly anyway regardless. Hmm.p
Negative 3995 phey people, I am stuck trying to integrate java and paypal together. I have posted here a hrefhttpforum.springsource.orgshowthread.phpp316498post316498 relnofollowhttpforum.springsource.orgshowthread.phpp316498post316498ap  pany help would be greatly appreciated, please advise.p  h3Updateh3  pwell my dilemma is that if I was to use a paypal button as mentioned, when do I actually save the form information to my local database  In other words I need to save the user information etc. only AFTER payment confirmation, it would be useless to do it before.  br My understanding is that the return URL only will be triggered if there is a successful transaction.  If that is the case, then there must be a way to identify this incoming response from paypal so that it was associated with the form post for this user.  In other words for this session.  In that way, the user data can then be saved.  I know there is something called IPN Could that be incorpated in the same form initially so we get back a confirmation  I am just trying to figure out how to be in the same session so I can persist the user information.  AND if the users credit card is rejected, does it still go back to the RETURN URL regardless  Need to distinguish somehow.brp  pLastly, I was playing around with the HTTPPOST code, basically I am tring to simulate a browser here.p  precodepublic void testPost15 throws ClientProtocolException, IOException       HttpClient client  new DefaultHttpClient              HttpPost post  new HttpPosthttpswww.paypal.comcgibinwebscr              post.setHeaderUserAgent, Mozilla5.0 Windows U Windows NT 6.1 enGB rv1.9.2.3 Gecko20100401 Firefox3.6.3               conn.setRequestProperty UserAgent, Mozilla4.0 compatible MSIE 8.0 Windows NT 6.2 Trident4.0 SLCC2 .NET CLR 2.0.50727 .NET CLR 3.5.30729 .NET CLR 3.0.30729 Media Center PC 6.0              httpPost.setHeader Accept, texthtml,applicationxhtmlxml,applicationxmlq0.9,q0.8              post.setHeaderAccept,texthtml,applicationxhtmlxml,applicationxmlq0.9,q0.8               httpPost.setHeader AcceptLanguage, enus,enq0.5              post.setHeaderAcceptLanguage,engb,enq0.5              ListltNameValuePairgt params  new ArrayListltNameValuePairgt             params.addnew BasicNameValuePaircmd, sxclick             params.addnew BasicNameValuePaircmd, xclick             params.addnew BasicNameValuePaircmd, extenter             params.addnew BasicNameValuePairredirectcmd, xclicksubscriptions             params.addnew BasicNameValuePairbusiness, abclogixplayer.com             params.addnew BasicNameValuePaircurrencycode, USD             params.addnew BasicNameValuePairamount, 4             params.addnew BasicNameValuePairitemname, PiT words             params.addnew BasicNameValuePairnonote, 1             params.addnew BasicNameValuePairreturn, httplocalhost8080pitweb0.0.1SNAPSHOTwelcome              post.setEntitynew UrlEncodedFormEntityparams             HttpResponse response  client.executepost             InputStream is  response.getEntity.getContent             BufferedReader reader  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReaderis             StringBuilder str  new StringBuilder             String line  null             whileline  reader.readLine  null                 str.appendline  n                          is.close                 String responseText  str.toString                 System.out.printlnresponse responseText  codepre  pand I think I am onto something, it says You have requested an outdated version of PayPal.

Negative 3995 pSo, I am using a hrefhttpwww.mattephraim.comblog20090708introducingghostscriptsharpMatthew Ephraims GhostscriptSharpa, which is a simple C wrapper for the unmanaged Win32 Ghostscript DLL in my ASP.Net MVC project.  Some backgroundp  pWhat I am attempting to do is have a user upload a PDF, and then convert that document into an image that I can then save off into whatever directory I choose as well as do some other OOP to tie that new image to my site.p  pI decided to use Mr. Ephraims wrapper class GhostscriptSharp because it was simple enough to use, and it gives me relatively clean access to the DLLs API.  p  pTo test it, I created a dummy C console application to make sure I could load the DLL, access it, hand it a PDF file on the local disk and then have it write a JPG to the same local disk.  After a few learning experiences, I had success.  I would hand it CINPUT.pdf, it would hand me COUTPUT.jpg. p  pHowever, after integrating the GhostScriptSharp code that I had in the console application into my ASP.NET MVC project to the point of where I was calling the DLL with Pinvoke, Ghostscript is returning with the interror code code100code, which is a fatal error is called codeEFatalcode in the GhostScript source code.  I get the same result with both the file that is uploaded through the HTML form, and if I hand it the exact same hardcoded paths that I used in my working console application.p  pFor reference, the lines which the exception is thrown are 9397 in GhostScriptSharp.cs which is in the codeCallApicode functionp  precodeint result  InitAPIgsInstancePtr, args.Length, args  if result lt 0    throw new ExternalExceptionGhostscript conversion error, result  codepre  pObviously the exception is thrown because coderesultcode is code100code.p  pWhen InitAPI is called, the instance ptr is a valid codeintcode though I dont know if the instance of GS is correct or not, args has a length of 20 is a codestring[]code of valid GhostScript options including the correctlyescaped paths to my input amp output files.p  pLong story short, what am I doing wrong  The error code code100code seems like a catchall because there is no documentation that states what could possibly be going wrong here.p  pAny help is much appreciated, thank you in advance.p

Negative 3995 pIm using before and after insert triggers to generate ids primary key of the form IDNAME000001 in several tables. At the moment, the value of the hibernate generator class of these pojos is strongassignedstrong. A random string is assigned to the object to be persisted and when its inserted by hibernate, the trigger assigns a correct id value.p  pThe problem with this approach is that Im unable to retrieve the persisted object because the id only exists in the database, not in the object I just saved.p  pI guess I need to create a custom generator class that could retrieve the id value assigned by the trigger.

Negative 3995 pMy work asked me to port our program that someone else wrote from Windows to Linux.

Negative 3995 pIm really upset with Hibernatep  pI have a database table mysql that holds parentchild relationships that allow me to build a tree of categories.  I have multiple threads which can try to get and if not there create the category path with several parentchild rows implied at roughly the same time.p  pThe problem is that Im using TRANSACTIONREADCOMMITTED only, and so race conditions can occur where a thread can create a parentchild for a category subpath because it didnt find it, and then lo another thread did this at the same time.  To try to solve this problem, I put a unique constraint on the parentchild ids and a unique constraint on the full category path.  Then, I hoped that in my session, I would catch the hibernate ConstraintViolationException, and knowing that another thread wrote the new relationship for me, I query for the row that the other thread wrote in the catch clause.  And try to continue in that thread doing all the things it needs to do with the session.p  pThis is the ONLY way I can think of to solve the problem of multiple threads doing the work of getcreating the same long category path with several sub parentchild relationship rows at the same time, and ensuring that the unique constraint is upheld.p  pBut hibernate invalidates the session on ConstraintViolationException and ultimately throws an assertion exception null id in com.stagirite.bean.Category entry dont flush the Session after an exception occurs so my solution is unviable.p  pHow am I going to solve this throughout my application for getcreate models that dont create duplicate rows, without using a pessimistic lockp  pAndyp

Negative 3995 pI am in my first programming class and I am now reaching the end of the semester.  I have an online portfolio where I share my college accomplishments.  At this point in the semester, I would like to upload some of the simple Applets I have created to my online portfolio.  My portfolio is hosted on Weebly.com.  I tried uploading the files to the host site and using the simple  tags to run the applet within the html.  Im quite sure Im accessing the files using the correct directories.  But before we jump to any conclusions there, I decided I ought to run the applets locally to ensure Im doing everything correctly.  I am on a macbook pro running OS 10.6.6. In Java Preferences, my Java SE versions are Java SE 6 64bit and Java SE 6 32bit.  My plugin version is 1.6.0 found in SystemLibraryJavaJavaVirtualMachines.  These are the only versions I have on my machine.  My research tells me that I may be having version disagreements.  Some forums have suggested going back to plugin version 1.5 although, I have no idea how. Im pretty sure now though that apple has updated Safari to a 64bit version.  I have Eclipse set to 1.6 also.

I tried making a lab051 subdirectory because thats the package name in the code.  No luck.  Both the class file and the html file are in the same folder on the desktop.

Negative 3995 pI am trying to replace a Label by a TextField in a ListView. I saw a similar wicket example few weeks ago over internet, but I dont remember the link. I have added AjaxEventBehavior  onDblClick to the ListItem by which I want to replace a Label by a TextField and also added AjaxFormComponentUpdatingBehavior  onBlur to the TextField such that the TextField will be replaced by Label. Somehow it is not working. The List model for the ListView contain only aaaaaaaaaaaaa, bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb, cccccccccccccc [as I am testing it] so the first Label will be aaaaaaaaaaaaa, if I double click on this Label the TextField is appearing the place of the Label cccccccccccccc, which is unexpected. And also the onBlur event is not working. Hope I can explain the problems.

Negative 3995 pAn example final question for my operating systems classp  pMost operating systems support memorymapped files this describes files which are mapped into the address space of a running process.  Reads and writes to the file are converted into memory reads and writes.  We can imagine the existence of two new system calls, map and unmap.p  pa Consider map it accepts a file name and a virtual address, causing the operating system to map the file into the address space starting at the virtual address.  Describe how the virtual memory system could be used to support this call.p  pb Consider unmap it disassociates the file from the virtual address space.  Describe the stats that should be taken to implement this system call.  List all your assumptions.p  pc In many UNIX systems, the inodes are kept at the start of disk. An alternative design is to allocate an inode when a file is created and put the inode at the start of the first block of the file.  Discuss the pros and cons of this alternative.p  pd What would happen if the bitmap or free list containing information about free disk blocks was completely lost due to a crash Is there anyway to recover from this disaster, or is the disk no longer usable.  Discuss your answer for a UNIX and FATstyle of diskblock allocation.p  pAny information of discussion on these questions is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 3995 pUsing Google App Engine python SDK, I created a custom JSONProperty as a subclass of db.TextProperty. My goal is to store a python dict on the fly as JSON and retrieve it easily.

Negative 3995 pIm trying to create a MS SQL 2005 stored procedure to allocate stock from a warehouse for a particular component in an order.

Negative 3995 pThe requirement is to display all public content and all content that has been restricted to the viewers region. p  pCurrently this is being accomplished by producing two views in blocks on a standard page.   One view is set up to display all news articles that do not have a N in a restrict to region field.  Another view is set up to display all news articles that have a Y in a restrict to region field AND uses php code in a contextual filter to add the condition that the region field in the news article matches the region field in the user profile.  Stacking these views in the content field of a standard page results in a page that returns all news articles that are not restricted AND all news articles that are restricted to the users region.p  pUndesirable complications of this strategy include separate pagination and the necessity of creating multiple views to extend the functionality to additional content types or to expand to cities or states.p  pCan you think of a way to apply the complex filter on a single view so as to avoid the need for presenting a separate unrestricted view followed by a view restricted to records whos region matches the viewers region   p  pOr to apply the filter as a permission on fieldsp  pThanks n advance,p

Negative 3995 pIm trying to understand how unit testing works. So far i understand youre testing the output of functions based on what you put in. Ok. Does that mean if your function has the only possibility of returning one datatype you only have to write one test for it So say i write a function that only has the possibility of returning TRUE or FALSE, does that mean i would just be checking if the response is boolean  p  pAnd then also say i have a function that is pulling posts from a blog from a database. Say have the function set to if number of rows  0 return FALSE, else return the results. So i now i have the possibility of a function that could return a boolean value or an array. How the heck do you test that The function now doesnt rely solely on the input, it relies on whats in the database. p

But I also need other parameters that I dont want to show up on the results page url.p  pMy app needs the ability to have multiple searches within one browser session. For example, having multiple tabs all searching at the same time. So the session object is abstracted to contain a map of session state objects. These hold state data for each search. A new session state is created each time a request is made to the search controller. This session state is then fetched by the results controller.p  pOur bookmarking process needs to be completely state free. So a person should be able to bookmark the results page url or copy and paste the url into a new tab or another browser.

Negative 3995 pIve done a lot of research on this and a lot of testing.p  pAs I understand it, HTTP headers are only set if the web server is setup to do so, and may default to a particular encoding even if developers didnt intend this.  Meta headers are only set if the developer decided to do so in their code... this may also be set automatically by some development frameworks  which is problematic if the developer didnt consider this .p  pIve found that if these are set at all, they often conflict with each other. eg. the HTTP header says the page is codeiso88591code while the meta tag specifies codewindows1252code. I could assume one supersedes the other  likely the meta tag , but that seems fairly unreliable.  It also seems like very few developers consider this when dealing with their data, so dynamically generated sites are often mixing encodings or using encodings that they dont intend to via different encodings coming from their database.p  pstrongMy conclusion has been to do the followingstrongp  ol liCheck the encoding of every page using codembdetectencodingcode.li liIf that fails, I use the meta encoding  codehttpequivContentType...code .li liIf there is no meta contenttype, I use the HTTP headers  codecontenttypecode .li liIf there is no http contenttype, I assume UTF8.li liFinally, I convert the document using mbconvertencoding. Then I scrape it for content.  Ive purposely left out the encoding to convert to, to avoid that discussion here. li ol  pIm attempting to get as much accurate content as possible, and not just ignore webpages because the developers didnt set their headers properly.p  pstrongWhat problems do you see with this approachstrongp  pstrongAm I going to run into problems using the mbdetectencoding and mbconvertencoding methodsstrongp
Negative 3995 pIm playing around with WCF REST on .NET 4.0, and I ended up wanting to find out if the following idea is somehow possible to implementp  pI have a very basic set of POCOs against an EF 4.1 CF project. All of them inherit from a base codeEntitycode class for the sole purpose of defining a PK.p  precodepublic abstract Entity      public int Id  get set   codepre  pNow, for the most part, Ill have separate operations for the CRUD functionality for each of my entities or aggregates, on larger systems I guess.p  pe.g.p  precode[ServiceContract] public class UserService      [OperationContract]     public void AddUser user           commit to EF         fooContext.Users.Adduser         fooContext.SaveChanges       codepre  pNow, this is primarily just for convenience, but I was thinking that something like this would be really handyp  precode[ServiceContract] public abstract class BaseCrudServiceltTgt where T  Entity      [OperationContract]     public void AddT entity           commit to EF via generic methods         fooContext.SetltTgt.Addentity         fooContext.SaveChanges        public class UserService  BaseCrudServiceltUsergt       blah  codepre  p... which would theoretically allow me to access that operation via codehttpltrootgtuserserviceaddcode and work with it as I would expect to, except that I cant inherit a codeServiceContractcodedecorated class, so theres no hope of automagically cascading functionality down to the endpoints themselves.p  pI was wondering strongis there a way to do this somehowstrong I know that inheritance in this manner wont cut it, but are there other ways to do this Repeating similar pieces of code across multiple service operations just sounds like something that somebody would have thought of before and fashioned a cleaner modus operandi of implementing.p
Negative 3995 pI am writing an application for a dual screen android device. p  pI have a method which is called on the press of a button which notifies an adapter displayed on one screen, i.e. on the RightActivity and then fires an intent to a map displaying on the other screen i.e. the LeftActivity. The method is as follows p  precodepublic void onClickView v       MyAction.fireIntentToMapcontext, myList  fire intent to map on the left screen     MyListAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged  adapter is for listview displayed on right screen  codepre  pWhat I want is that, the intent should first be fired to the map activity on the left screen, and only after that i.e. the map displaying the items received in the intent the list adapter should be notified and the list view should refresh itself.p  pHowever, this does not happen. What happens is, that the call goes in the codefireIntenToMapcode method and the intent is fired i.e. a call to codestartActivityintentcode is made. However, before the intent can be received by the map, the line codeMyListAdapter.notifyDataSetChangedcode executes, and the list view is refreshed. The intent is received later by the map. p  pWhy does this happen How can I get a single thread behaviour map processes intent first, then list view is refreshed here p  p.p

Negative 3995 pI rewrote the original radix sort algorithm for Python from emWikipediaem using arrays from emSciPyem to gain performance and to reduce code length, which I managed to accomplish. Then I took the emclassicem inmemory, pivot based quick sort algorithm from emLiterate Programmingem and compared their performance.p  pI had the expectation that radix sort will beat quick sort beyond a certain threshold, which it did not. Further, I found a hrefhttperik.gorset.no201104radixsortisfasterthanquicksort.html relnofollowErik Gorsets Blogsa asking the question strongIs radix sort faster than quick sort for integer arraysstrong. There the answer is thatp  blockquote   p.. the benchmark shows the MSB inplace radix sort to be consistently over 3 times faster than quicksort for large arrays.p blockquote  pUnfortunately, I could not reproduce the result the differences are that a Erik chose Java and not Python and b he uses the emMSB inplace radix sortem, whereas I just fill embucketsem inside a Python dictionary.p  pAccording to theory radix sort should be faster linear compared to quick sort but apparently it depends a lot on the implementation.

If you select it in the tree then it will be selected in the grid, and if you select it in the grid then it will be selected in the tree. p  pThey also want me to remember the last selection when you navigate away and be able to type a code n on a different page and go directly to this page with the item you typed selected.

The program has to be able to send and receive serial communications with three different devices semiconcurrently. The original program was written in VB 6 no multithreading and I did plan on just modding it to work with the newer products that need to be tested until it posed a safety hazard when the UI locked up due to excessive serial communications during a test. This resulted in part of the tester hardware blowing up, so I decided to try rewriting the app in VB.Net as Im more comfortable with it to begin with and because I thought multithreading might help solve this problem.p  pMy plan was to send commands to the other pieces of equipment from the main app thread and spin the receiving ends off into their own threads so that the main thread wouldnt lock up when timing is critical. However, Ive yet to come to terms with my options. To add to my problems, I need to display the received communications in separate rich text boxes as theyre received while the data from one particular device needs to be parsed by the main program, but only the text that results from the most current test I need the text box to contain all received data though. p  pSo far, Ive investigated delegates, handling the threads myself, and just began looking into BackgroundWorkers.  I tried to use delegates earlier today, but couldnt figure out a way to update the text boxes. Would I need to use a call back function to do this since I cant do it in the body of the delegate function itself The problem I see with handling threads myself is figuring out how to pass data back and forth between the thread and the rest of the program. BackgroundWorkers, as I said, I just started investigating so Im not sure what to think about them yet.p  pI should also note that the plan was for the spawned threads to run continuously until somehow triggered to stop. Is this possible with any of the above options Are there other options I havent discovered yet  p  pSorry for the length and the fact that I seem to ramble disjointed bits of info, but Im on a tight deadline and stressed out to the point I cant think straight Any adviceinfolinks is more than appreciated. I just need help weighing the options so I can pick a direction and move forward. Thanks to everybody who took the time to read this mess p

Negative 3995 pIm probably about a 7 or 8 on proficiency with jQuery on a scale of 110, so Im not sure if this even makes sense, but Id like to know if anyone knows of a jQuery function or possibly a plugin which allows a branch of jQuery to only be executed if a given condition is true. Otherwise, Id love to hear if someone thinks the concept is flawed in some way strongEDITstrong and emhowem it is flawedp  pWhile one could control attachment of various events using normal JavaScript syntax similar to thisp  precodevar desiredElement  .parent                         find the parent element                      .hoveroverFunction,offFunction     attach an event while Ive got the parent in scope                      .find.childelement             then find and return the child if booleanVar1                                         if one condition     desiredElement.clickclickFunction1                   attach one event  else if booleanVar2                                  or if a different condition     desiredElement.clickclickFunction2                   attach a different event  else                                                   otherwise     desiredElement.clickclickFunction3                   attach a default event  .parent.find.otherchild                         or .parent .otherchild     .cssSomePredefinedCssMapping     .hide ... codepre  pI was wondering if there is a way to do it all in jQuery or if there is a good reason not to... something perhaps like thisp  precode.parent                                 find the parent element     .hoveroverFunction,offFunction       attach an event while Ive got the parent in scope     .find.childelement                  then find the child         .whenbooleanVar1                   if one condition             .clickclickFunction1             attach one event         .orWhenbooleanVar2                 or if a different condition             .clickclickFunction2             attach a different event         .orElse                            otherwise             .clickclickFunction3             attach a default event         .end     .end     .find.otherchild         .cssSomePredefinedCssMapping ... codepre  pemNote I think this is syntactically correct, assuming the booleans and functions are defined appropriately, but Im pretty sure Ive gotten the intent across pretty clearlyemp  pthe proposed jQuery seems a little neater to me  agreedisagree  so here are my questionsp  ul liIs there some part of native jQuery that basically already does thisli liIs there an extension already out there that allows this type of thingli liIs it harder to do than I am thinking Id think something like keeping the current element set if the condition is true, pushing an empty element set if condition is false, then popping the element set back out for each codeorcode condition would do it, just like the codeendcode method pops back the previous set after a codefindcode callli liIs there something that makes it significantly less efficientli ul  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe question asks how to do this with method chaining or why it would be unadvisable specifics preferred. While it doesnt ask for alternatives, such alternatives might be necessary to explain problems with a jQuery chaining approach. Also, since the example above immediately evaluates the booleans, any other solution should do the same.p

Negative 3995 pI have been using Java for a very long time and I have problem getting used to C programming styles.p  pHow we can manage scenarios like belowp  ul lipInstance variables are objects which cannot be created using default constructor. In java constructor parameters can be decided upon in higher level class constructor.pli lipInstance variable is a reference type and we need to run a simple algorithm condition, calculation,... in the constructor and then create and assign an object to that reference.pli ul  pThere are possibly similar scenarios in which we need to initiate instance variables in places other than the constructor initialization list. I guess GCC would allow to do that issues a warning, but VC does not seem to allow. p  pI guess most of these can be done using pointers but I am trying to avoid pointers as much as I can to minimize runtime crash and also hard to debug problems. p

Negative 3995 pI have been having this Xcode problem for a couple of months where my iOS simulator stops working whenever i run any application on Xcode and says, The simulated application quit. and iOS Simulator could not find the SDK. The SDK may need to be reinstalled. I am running Xcode 4.3.3 and have iOS sdk 5.1 and everything updated but it happened on my previous version of Xcode also. I have tried reinstalling Xcode over 10 times now and have been posting this question for a while now. No one has been able to get a solution. I have even sent in a bug report to apple but i dont think they will respond. I have tried doing everything every other person that has this problem has been told to do in other threads. Im honestly thinking about just buying a new mac and seeing if Xcode will work on that one or taking in my current one to get looked at by apple. So if anyone has any ideas please let me know.p

Negative 3995 pI am trying to make a QStyledItemDelegate behave like a custom QWidget I wrote, so i can switch my code to a modelview approach.p  pThe custom QWidget is a complex button which shows four sub buttons in its corners on mouse over so all in all there are five signals. Its also dragampdroppable with a custom drag pixmap. To achieve this I am using mousePressEvent, mouseReleaseEvent, mouseMoveEvent, enterEvent and leaveEvent. This is what it looks like with and without the sub buttons shown on mouse over img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7JojJ.png altenter image description herep  pI have since switched my main code to use a modelview approach and am trying to use this widget as a QStyledItemDelegate for my customised ListView.

However, I need this to be a mouse over event. After a bit more research I tried connecting the QAbstractItemView.entered slot to QAbstractItemView.edit signalp  precodeself.entered.connect self.edit  codepre  pThis works only for the first item I move my mouse pointer over, then I get these errorsp  precodeedit editing failed codepre  pSo now Im stuck again with these problemsp  ul lihow to properly close the editor there is no QAbstractItemView.leave event or similar.li lihow to ensure that the mouse clicks actually trigger the buttons in the FanyButton class rather than just interact with the QAbstractIremViewli ul  pI have a feeling Im heading into the wrong direction here, so any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pCheers, frankp

Negative 3995 pIm attempting to write an Office Addin for Microsoft Word 2007 and higher using VSTO on Visual Studio 2010 and C.  p  pThe addin will insert images into the document that are downloaded from the internet from a custom CGI script.  These images update daily, so I have added a button to refresh all the images from the server upon request.  However, Im not certain how to store the original identifier for the image along with the image embedded in the document to know which image to get from the server.  The identifier can be anywhere from a few characters to several hundred 200 characters long, but are an ASCII identifier.p  pCurrently I insert the picture like sop  precode    public void InsertPictureFromIdentifierString identifier              Document vstoDocument  Globals.Factory.GetVstoObjectthis.Application.ActiveDocument          Word.Selection selection  this.Application.Selection         if selection  null ampamp selection.Range  null                       Insert the picture control             var picture  vstoDocument.Controls.AddPictureContentControlselection.Range, mypic              And update the image             UpdatePicturepicture, identifier                codepre  pThen UpdatePicture is called both on the initial insert, and upon refresh, to update the imagep  precode    public void UpdatePicturePictureContentControl picture, string identifier              const int BytesToRead  1000000           Download the image from the scrip         var request  WebRequest.Createhttpmy.server.comgraph.cgiidentifier         var response  request.GetResponse         var responseStream  response.GetResponseStream         var reader  new BinaryReaderresponseStream         var memoryStream  new MemoryStream         Byte[] byteBuffer  new byte[BytesToRead]           Transfer to a memory stream         var bytesRead  reader.ReadbyteBuffer, 0, BytesToRead         while bytesRead gt 0                      memoryStream.WritebyteBuffer, 0, bytesRead             bytesRead  reader.ReadbyteBuffer, 0, BytesToRead                    Set the image from the memory stream         picture.Image  new System.Drawing.BitmapmemoryStream      codepre  pAs you can see I pass the identifier into update  but the question is how to get that identifier back from the picture  Ive inserted the next day on a refresh.  Ive tried using the pictures Tag, but that is limited to 64 characters.  Ive even tried using the pictures Title property, but that seems to silently fail on some other maximum limit. p  pThe identifier will need to be persisted between save  loads, move with the image in the document, and be invisible I cant just add text after the image with the identifier.p

The best possible solution seems to me to introduce kind of forward declaration for the members of codeCommunicationcode, but Im afraid that I dont know how to accomplish this.p  pIve also thought about the class setup, whether it fits the purpose, but didnt come up with a better solution yet.p

Specifically, the objectid variable can be either segment 6 or 7 instead of segment 5. p  pheres an example of what the URL looks like when methodA is called p  precode     httpmyservermyappmycontrollermethodA10.14.123.123H8699A417 codepre  pHeres an example of what the URL looks like when methodB is called p  precode    httpmyservermyappmycontrollermethodB10.14.3.44H8699AA14417 codepre  pIm not sure if this is good design or not, but I decided to change the signature of methodA so that it accepts a number, representing the segment ID.  So from methodB, I could do something like p  precode  thisgtmethodA6 codepre  pPROBLEM  QUESTION  There are two things that i dont understand.

Technically, it should be empty.  Ive double checked to make sure that only 2 methods call methodA. p  pSecond, I dont understand why when i dump the contents of the parameter, its showing the IP address, which is uri segment 3. p  pSo far, the new code for methodA looks like this p  precodepublic function methodAuriObjectid   echo uriObjectid       data[listofpts]    thisgtswitchesmodelgtgetallwidgetsthisgturigtsegment3,thisgturigtsegment4                 data[model]  thisgturigtsegment4       data[ip]  thisgturigtsegment3        data[objectid]  thisgturigtsegment5          data[maincontent]allstats       thisgtloadgtviewincludestemplate, data  end methodA codepre  pAny help would be appreciated.

Negative 3995 pMy app uses libssh2 to communicate over SSH, and generally works fine.  One problem I have is when the remote host dies unexpectedly  the remote host in this case is an embedded device that can lose power at any time, so this isnt uncommon.p  pWhen that happens, my app detects that the remote computer has stopped responding to pings, and tears down the local end of the SSH connection like thisp  precodevoid SSHSession  CleanupSession     if uploadFileChannel           libssh2channelfreeuploadFileChannel       uploadFileChannel  NULL         if sendCommandsChannel           libssh2channelfreesendCommandsChannel       sendCommandsChannel  NULL         if session           libssh2sessiondisconnectsession, bye bye       libssh2sessionfreesession       session  NULL      codepre  pPretty straightforward, but the problem is that the libssh2channelfree calls can block for a long time waiting for the remote end to respond to the Im going away now message, which it will never do because its powered off... but in the meantime, my app is frozen blocked in the cleanuproutine, which isnt good.p  pIs there any way short of hacking libssh2 to avoid this  Id like to just tear down the local SSH data structures, and never block during this teardown.  I suppose I could simply leak the SSH session memory, or delegate it to a different thread, but those seem like ugly hacks rather than proper solutionsp

Negative 3995 pI am working on an HTML5  JQuery Mobile webapp. It basically shows records from a database and has a multipage setup. I have a list with records, clicking on a record title takes you to the detail page of that record. And thats where something goes wrong. p  pAfter dynamically injecting data via JSON into the detail page of a record and refreshing it using code.triggercreatecode, my page height is not set properly. Using Firebug, I can see that JQM adds a codeuipagecode class to the codedatarolepagecode div and codeuicontentcode to the codedatarolecontentcode div, and gives both of them a codeminheightcode value that does not match the actual screen height. As a result, the codeuicontentcode div does not fill up the entire page, but only about two third of the page. It then shows a scroll bar in this div for any overflowing content. The lower third of the page stays grey and empty. It actually looks like an oldfashioned frameset with no page loaded in the bottom frame.p  pUsing Firebug, I disabled all assigned styles one by one and discovered that the page only shows properly when I disable codeoverflowx hiddencode as set by the codeuicontentcode class. However... then my fixed header is no longer fixed, but moves up together with the page. I tried adding codeminheight 100code to the CSS for both code.uicontentcode and code.uipage[style]code as minheight is hard coded on the div element by JQM, I added codeimportantcode, but no luck. p  pI am using JQM 1.2.0 Final together with JQuery 1.8.2. The problem occurs on latest versions of Firefox, Chrome, IE9, as well as on Android 2.3.6 after compiling the app using PhoneGap Build.

Negative 3995 pI am currently working on a project to make a website more accessible. In that regard I have encountered a problem related to tabindextab order. A menu button, once clicked, displays a submenu containing a menubar with two tabs. Each of these tabs, when clicked, displays another submenu. What I want is to be able to focus directly on the first tab when the menu is clicked. Once the first tab has gotten focus, one should be able to tab back and forth between this and the second tab, and select either one of these by pressing Enter. p  pOnce an item has been selected, pressing tab should continue to go through all the items in the submenu displayed for the selected tab. I have created the following code for thisp  precode     First set the tabindex for both tabs to 0 to be able to      tab through them sequentially     tab1.attrtabindex, 0     tab2.attrtabindex, 0       Set focus on the first tab once the main menu link has been clicked     menulink.clickfunction tab1.focus        Select appropriate tab when ENTER is pressed     tab1.keydownfunctionevent           ifevent.which  13  event.preventDefault          tab1.click          tab2.keydownfunctionevent          ifevent.which  13  event.preventDefault          tab2.click      codepre  pThe problem occurs if I press tab to go to tab2 and then try to shifttab back to tab1 and select that.

Negative 3995 pWorking on upgrading from jQuery 1.8 to 1.9 and running into a problem. We have certain pages that can be loaded into a modal on any given page. We do this using ajax and then parsing out the codescriptcode elements from the returned html. We then append the html to the page and then we append the scripts to the codeheadcode. It would look something like thisp  precodecontrollerelement   html  bodyscripts   controllerelement, script .remove  .modalbody .append controllerelement head.append bodyscripts codepre  pThis was working prior in 1.8 but were now running into problems in 1.9. The issue seems to revolve around document ready events. The html has some inline javascript that needs to run on document ready, which runs right after the append which seems to be right according to documentation. What really needs to happen is it needs to run after the javascript scripts are appended to the codeheadcode. And we cant just switch the order of these two lines, because the js needs to run after the html is loaded to bind events to the dom. Really, some thoughts on what might have happened between 1.8 and 1.9 would be very helpful. Or if anyone else successfully implemented loading a new page via ajax into a modal, Id like to hear implementations. Thanks.p

Negative 3995 pIm writing function unit tests for a REST API built with Symfony2. Part of the REST API checks HTTP basic authentication against a third party web service.p  pThis presents a bit of a challenge when it comes to unit testing as I cant create a temporary user for the third party web service. p  pI could hard code credentials in, but I was thinking of an alternative approach. Would it be bad practice to hard code in some logic that shortcircuits the third party API call if the environment is codetestcode Is there a better way to do something like this Im sure other applications face this problem.p

Negative 3995 pI have been developing an Android app using OpenGL 1.0 for quite some time using a naive approach to rendering, basically making a call to glColor4f... and glDrawArrays... with FloatBuffers each frame.  I am hitting a point where graphics is becoming a huge bottleneck as I add more UI elements and the number of draw calls increases.p  pSo Im now looking for the best way to group all of these calls into one or two or three draw calls.  It looks like the cleanest, most efficient and canonical way to do this is to use VBO objects, available from OpenGL ES 2.0 on.  However, this would require a HUGE refactoring on my part to switch my whole graphics backend from ES 1.0 to ES 2.0.  I am not sure if this is a good decision, or if there are acceptable ways to group my drawing calls in 1.0 that would work fine for relatively simple 2D data squares, rounded rectangle TRIANGLEFANs, etc., or if it really might be worth biting the bullet and making the switch.  I might also mention that I have a HEAVY reliance on translation and scaling that is so convenient with the fixed pipeline of ES 1.0.p  pLooking around, I am surprised to find almost NO people in my position, talking about the tradeoffs and complexity at hand for such a switch.  Any thoughtp

The other part of the question remain  How should the new AddDomain method described above look like GET and POST   it should take the value of the KlientID instead of displaying the list of Clients to choose from.p

Negative 3995 pIn my application I plot about 8 million vertices with a single call to WebGLs drawarrays using the LINESTRIP flag.  I dont actually want one long line, I want about 200k short lines, so I cap all the short lines with extra vertices, and tell the vertex shader to push the line caps into negative z to create invisible bridges.  The rendering is quasistatic the user can click various things that trigger a rerender so it doesnt have to be superfast, but Id really hoped it would take less than 200ms on modernish computers.p  pOn my laptop [emUPDATEem which runs Win7 using a few Intel i7s as its CPU and an integrated HD Graphics 4000 for a GPU] I get around 100ms in Chrome, which is good.  Oddly though, Firefox gets around 12 seconds.  On my Samsung Chromebook 550 I get anything from 600ms to 2s, often it starts quick and then subsequent renders get slower but it can get faster too.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  ul liWhat might be causing the change in render speed on my Chromebookli liWhy is Firefox so much slower than Chrome on my laptopli liIs it worth spending ages trying to make it run faster i.e. can I expect much improvement  Any tipsli ul  pstrongNotesstrongp  ul lipFor the Chromebook repeated rendering tests, the only thing happening between renders is a uniform is changed to toggle between color palettes implemented as textures. Chrome dev tools doesnt seem to think there are any major changes in the pages memory usage during the testing. pli lipIm using gl.finish and console.time to see how long the rendering is taking.pli lipExcept during debugging, I render to an orphaned canvas and then copy sections of the result to various small canvases on the page emUPDATEem using drawImage with the webgl canvas as the first argument.  This probably does take a bit of time, but the numbers reported above dont seem to change much with or without the copy operation and with or without the webgl canvas attached to the page body and visible.pli lipemUPDATEem There is a limit to how many vertices my laptop will render in one go, but the limit seems to fluctuate from moment to moment, if you go over the limit then it doesnt render anything.  The number is around the 8million mark, but sometimes its happy to go over 11million. Ive now set it to batch 2 million at a time.  Interestingly this seems to make my Chromebook go faster, but I cant be sure as its so inconsistent.  pli lipemUPDATEem Ive disabled DEPTHTEST and BLEND as I dont need them. Im not convinced it made any difference.  pli lipemUPDATEem Ive tried rendering with POINTS instead of LINES.  On my Chromebook it seemed to take about 1s with 0 point size i.e. rendering nothing, and then around 1.52s as I increased the point size through 1,2, and 5.pli lipemUPDATEem Keeping everything on the z0 plane doesnt seem to change the speed much, maybe it goes a little slower which Id expect as there are a lot more pixels to get through the fragment shader, though the fragment shader is just funneling a varying straight into glFragColor.pli ul

So with this logic PMBIDs...p  precode249941 249942 249943 249966 codepre  pwould be removed.p  pSo how do I do this well in SQL seen as my column is stringp  pIve been writing queries such as...p  precodeDELETE FROM Containers WHERE Dept LIKE 1 OR Dept LIKE 11 OR Dept LIKE 23 OR Dept LIKE 31 codepre  pObviously this statement doesnt work as it catches departments like 15, and 16, so for example PMBIDp  precode249967 codepre  pwould be included when it strongshouldntstrong as its not explicitly a 1,11,23, or 31 or a combination of these.p  pIs this possible with a string column Can we use the delimiter somehow to improve the queryp  pIll stop now as risk of overcomplicating the query, please let me know if you need any further information.p  pThanks in Advancep

Negative 3995 pFrom the a hrefhttpwww.lua.orgmanual5.1manual.htmlpdfloadLua 5.1 documentation for codeloadcodeap  blockquote   pLoads a chunk using function codefunccode to get its pieces. Each call to codefunccode must return a string that concatenates with previous results. A return of an empty string, strongnilstrong, or no value signals the end of the chunk.p blockquote  pFrom my testing, this is not actually true.  Or, rather, the documentation is at a minimum misleading.p  pConsider this example scriptp  precodefunction makeloaderreturnat     local x  0      return function         x  x  1          if x  returnat then return return true end          return nil     end end  x  0 repeat     x  x  1 until not loadmakeloaderx  printx codepre  pThe output is the number of successive calls to the function returned by codemakeloadercode that returned codenilcode before codeloadcode gives up and returns a function returning nothing.p  pOne would expect the output here to be 1 if the documentation is to be taken at face value.  However, the output is 3.  This implies that the argument to codeloadcode is called until it returns codenilcode emthree timesem before codeloadcode gives up.p  pOn the other hand, if the chunk function returns a string immediately and then codenilcode on subsequent calls, it only takes one codenilcode to stop loadingp  precodefunction makeloader     local x  0      return          fnfunction             x  x  1              if x  1 then return return true end              return nil         end,         getxfunction return x end      end  loader  makeloader loadloader.fn printloader.getx codepre  pThis prints 2 as I would expect.p  pSo my question is is the documentation wrong  Is this behavior desirable for some reason  Is this simply a bug in codeloadcode  It seems to appear intentional, but I cannot find any documentation explaining why.p

Negative 3995 pThis is very basic but i was wondering if there was a better way of programming the following concept. p  precode for int j  0 j lt node.ChildNodes[i].Attributes.Count j                                      if j  0 row.Cells[1].Value  ,                      row.Cells[1].Value  node.ChildNodes[i].Attributes[j].Name                   codepre  pBasically im outputting nodes in c to a table and i want each attribute name to be separated with a comma. The issue is that obviously for the first instance of the loop i wish not to have the comma preceded it, ie i could not just have p  precoderow.Cells[1].Value   ,   node.ChildNodes[i].Attributes[j].Name codepre  potherwise the output in the cell would look something likep  precode, name, day codepre  pinstead of p  precodename, day codepre  pSo although this works, it seems a waste of the computer time to check each time it loops that this is indeed the first iteration of the loop, especially as this loop is nested in a recursive method. Is there a better way of doing this p  pBearing in mind that node.ChildNodes[i].Attributes.Count in the for loop conditions may be 0, ie nodewhich is a xmlNode could have no child nodes, so the the loop doubles up as an existence check for the children too. p  pI hope i explained this wellp
Negative 3995 pI have a UITableView where I have section headers that can be tapped to expand or collapse the section.

At this moment everything is going OK. But when i scrolling down my tableview, cell goes behind header like in Contacts application , header is first letter of contact. And finally when i scroll enough to dont see that section with that cell on, and when i scroll up  to return to my display that section  i want to make this section automatically known that when i returnfrom scrolling away that section from view to it  i want that section already was closed with 0 cells in it.p  pMaybe i must use void prepareForReuse at my custom UITableViewHeaderFooterView, or scroll methods  or any tableView methodsp  pThank youp

However I am not sure if anything changed in this resepct with new 169 devices. If so this could be a step forward to solve my problem but of course would mean that I would need to add extra code for each scene to properly support this.p  pEDIT 2 Please refer to my second comment to LearnCocos2D answer.p  precode id sceneWithLevelNameLevelNamename      CCScene scene  [CCScene node]     I tried scene.position  CGPointMake0,88 but happens as described in my comment to Learncocos2ds answer     ShooterScene  shooterLayer  [[self alloc] initWithIdname]     [scene addChildshooterLayer]      I also tried to modify this layer shooterLayer but same proble, the black border stay.        return scene      codepre

Alternatively, the cache can also be based on Redis or Memcached, which is better cached data survives website restarts but adds more moving parts to the picture than I care to add to it.p  pInstead, I would like to implement the this functionality using my own databasep  pTable strongUsersstrong p  ul liUserID autoincremented identityli liUsername li liPassword li liEmail li liNameli lietc...li ul  pTable strongSessionsstrong p  ul liSessionID autoincremented identityli liUserID FK to Usersli liStartDateTimeli liEndDateTimeli liSessionKey GUIDli ul  pThe way I see things working is thisp  pOn login request, codeAuthServicecode creates an empty instance of my codeUserAuthSessioncode class implements codeIAuthSessioncode and calls my custom credentials providers codeTryAuthenticatecode method, which authenticates the user against the emUsersem table, populates codeUserAuthSessioncode with relevant user data and inserts a new record into the emSessionem table. p  pThen the auth session is cached in the inmemory cache and ServiceStack session cookies codessidcode and codesspidcode are created and sent to the browser.p  pIf the user checks strongRemember mestrong then additionally my custom credential providers codeOnAuthenticatecode method creates a permanent login cookie that contains the users username and the autogenerated emSessions.SessionKeyem.  This cookie will help us track the user on subsequent visits even if the auth session is no longer in the cache.p  pNow, suppose the site has been restarted, the cache is gone, so when our user returns to the site his auth session is nowhere to be found. The current logic in codeAuthenticateAttributecode redirects the user back to the login screen, but instead I want to change the flow so as to to try to identify the user based on my custom login cookie, i.e.p  ol lilook up the latest emSessionsem record for the username extracted from the login cookieli licheck if its emSessionKeyem matches the key in the login cookieli liif they match, then ul liread the users data from the emUsersem tableli licreate my custom auth session instance, fill it with user data and cache it just like at initial loginli liinsert a new emSessionsem record with a new emSessionKeyem valueli lisend back to the browser a new login cookie to be used next timeli ulli liif the keys dont match then send the user back to the login screen.li ol  pDoes the above logic make sensep  pHas anyone already implemented anything similar using ServiceStackp  pIf I were to proceed with this approach, what is the best course of action that doesnt involve creating my own custom version of codeAuthenticateAttributecode  I.e. which hooks can I use to build this using the existing ServiceStack codep

Negative 3995 pTo draw in OpenGL, you specify an array of vertices, and then indices that connect together the array of vertices into a sensical order of primitives. You can do this with glDrawElements. To specify vertices, you can use glVertexPointer, in which you can specify a parameter stride  the gaps between contiguous elements in your array i.e. if you store a vertex in a struct containing other data, you stride to jump past the other data.p  pThis is great, but now I am using a hrefhttpassimp.sourceforge.net relnofollowAssimpa, which specifies its indices in a face struct.p  precodestruct aiFace      unsigned int indices     unsigned int numIndices   codepre  pPresumably, this is to support a mesh with different sized faces a mesh with triangles and quads.

Only the basic stuff is present in the doc.p  pAnyway, I have a problem when it comes to Eloquent and model relationships when it spans more than 2 models.p  pstrongFor example, I have the following scenario.strongp  pI have four database tables namely codeuserscode, codelocationscode, codeuserslocationscode, codepackagescode. And the relationship between the modeltables are as followsp  pUser can belong to many Location and viceversa. A location can have many packages.p  pAnd my corresponding model relationships are as followsp  precodeUser Model public function locations     return thisgtbelongsToManyLocation, userslocations, userid, locationid   Location Model public function users     return thisgtbelongsToManyUser, userslocations, locationid, userid  public function packages     return thisgthasManyPackage, locationid   Package Model public function location     return thisgtbelongsToLocation, locationid  codepre  pstrongWhat do I want to dostrong I want to get all the packages belong to a user. A user belongs to locations, and packages also belong to locations. So from all the locations that belong to the user, I want to retrieve the packages those belong to those locations of the user. I also want the result set to be paginated.p  pI have tried the followingp  precodeget the logged in user ID userId  Authusergtid first get all the locations of the user locations UserwithlocationsgtfinduserIdgtlocations declare an empty array to store the packages packages  array now loop through the locations foreachlocations as location     since each location can have many packages, we also have to loop through the packages     foreachlocationgtpackages as package         store the plan in the array         packages[]  package       ok now we got the list of packages return packages codepre  pThe strongproblemstrong is, with the above, I cannot implement pagination on the packages. Does anyone know how to do it properly and in an efficient manner using Eloquent Or is it just not possiblep

Negative 3995 pI am learning Python and will like to call some Python script from Fortranwill call codepy2fcode those will mostly do some type of logging etc.. My main code is still in Fortran. p  pWhile the opposite scenario calling Fortran from Python using codef2pycode is fairly common, I have not found much about codepy2fcode. One suggestion is to use cython, so, essentially to make py2C and the call it from Fortran. p  pThe other thing I can think of is to codecall executecommandlinecode I have not tried this yet, tried codecall systemcode though.. p  pI dont think codepy2fcode is rare, I just want to know which is the standard and better practice Cython or codecall executecommandlinecode Or is something else p

Negative 3995 pOkay so here is the short breakdown. I have an app in the app store. I created a new version, in which I changed storyboard localization to base. Everything works fine on simulator and device.p  pThe problem only occurs when I have the old currently in app store version on my device and try to test the new version with Xcode. The storyboard which is shown on the device is a mix between old and new version. New design but old arrangement. Because of my changes it crashes.p  pIf I deleted the old app before I run the new version everything works fine.p  pSo my questions arep  pWill an app update delete all old cached storyboards Can I test my update after app store approval under real conditions I selected to release it manually. Obviously it is some kind of a problem with a cached version. Can I somehow make sure that the old storyboard wont be usedp

Negative 3995 pwe have a strange performance problem with ObjectDB 2.5.301 and JBoss 7.1.1. We have two ObjectDB databases on one ObjectDB server. Production database is running 510 times slower than test database. Their size and number of records are almost identical. When running production database in separate test environment its speed is very good. We did a performance analysis on our 2 linux servers one running JBOSS and other running ObjectDB.  CPU utilization of JBOSS server is max 510 per core  CPU utilization of JBOSS server is 80150 this is per corep  pNow is the interesting part, when running a query from ObjectDB explorer CPU utilization is minimal ie. 1 Running a query from ObjectDB explorer on complete database which has 12000 records takes 30ms which we think is very good.

Negative 3995 pIf someone would clear my mind from the confusion behind lookahead relation to tokenizing involving greerynongreedy matching id be more than glad. Be ware this is a slightly long post because its following my thought process behind.p  pIm trying to write antlr3 grammar that allows me to match input such asp  pidentifierkeywordp  pI came up with a grammar like so in Antlr 3.4p  precodeKEYWORD keyword   IDENTIFIER     options greedyfalse LOWCHARHIGHCHAR     lowercase letters  fragment LOWCHAR    a..z  uppercase letters  fragment HIGHCHAR    A..Z  parse IDENTIFIER KEYWORD EOF codepre  phowever it complains about it can never match IDENTIFIER this way, which i dont really understand. The following alternatives can never be matched 1p  pBasically I was trying to specify for the lexer that try to match LOWCHARHIGHCHAR nongreedy way so it stops at KEYWORD lookahead. What ive read so far about ANTLR lexers that there supposed to be some kind of precedence of the lexer rules. If i specify KEYWORD lexer rule first in the lexer grammar, any lexer rules that come after shouldnt be able to match the consumed characters.p  pAfter some searching I understand that problem here is that it cant tokenize the input the right way because for example for input identifierkeyword the identifier part comes first so it decides to start matching the IDENTIFIER rule when there is no KEYWORD tokens matched yet.p  pThen I tried to write the same grammar in ANTLR 4, to test if the new runahead capabilities can match what i want, it looks like thisp  precodeKEYWORD keyword    lowercase letters  fragment LOWCHAR    a..z  uppercase letters  fragment HIGHCHAR    A..Z  IDENTIFIER     LOWCHARHIGHCHAR   parse IDENTIFIER KEYWORD EOF codepre  pfor the input identifierkeyword it produces this error line 11 mismatched input d expecting keywordp  pit matches character i the very first character as an IDENTIFIER token, and then the parser expects a KEYWORD token which he doesnt get this way.p  pIsnt the nongreedy matching for the lexer supposed to match till any other possibility is available in the look ahead Shouldnt it look ahead for the possibility that an IDENTIFIER can contain a KEYWORD and match it that wayp  pIm really confused about this, I have watched the video where Terence Parr introduces the new capabilities of ANTLR4 where he talks about runahead threads that watch for all right solutions till the end while actually matching a rule. I thought it would work for Lexer rules too, where a possible right solution for tokenizing input identifierkeyword is matching IDENTIFIER identifier and matching KEYWORD keywordp  pI think I have lots of wrongs in my head about nongreedygreedy matching. Could somebody please explain me how it worksp  pAfter all this Ive found a similar question here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11902168antlrtryingtomatchtokenwithinlongertokenANTLR trying to match token within longer tokena and made a grammar corresponding to thatp  precodeparse       identifier keyword   identifier       HIGHCHAR  LOWCHAR    lowercase letters  LOWCHAR    a..z  uppercase letters  HIGHCHAR    A..Z codepre  pThis does what I want now, however I cant see why I cant change the identifier rule to a Lexer rule and LOWCHAR and HIGHCHAR to fragments.  A Lexer doesnt know that letters in keyword can be matched as an identifier or vice versa Or maybe it is that rules are only defined to have a lookahead inside themselves, not all possible matching syntaxesp
Negative 3995 pI am creating a WPF application that allows the user to take a quiz then submit their answers and check the result in another page  xaml  window. My first page displays the list of questions in a ListView and a single button Submit. The questions in my ListView are binded from a class that I created which is named Question.

Negative 3995 pI need help figuring out what code is getting executed in the background in my app. If I run the Activity Monitor in Instruments on my app, even after I press the home button it uses about 1 of the CPU consistently.p  pThis is, Im assuming, causing iOS to kick my app out of the suspended state as soon as its backgroundTimeRemaining has expired. Even on screens where apparently nothing is happening, the app still uses CPU time and gets kicked out of the suspended state even if I just put the phone to sleep for a few minutes.p  pIve already gone through and done a projectwide search on NSTimers in my app to make sure nothing is getting fired after I leave the app, as well as put breakpoints in popular places for the app to receive network messages, but nothing seems to get hit.p  pIve confirmed this still happens when it isnt connected to the debugger and other apps seem to go to 0 or much closer to 0 CPU utilization when I press the home button.p  pWhat tool can help me achieve my goal and find out what code is running in the backgroundp  pstrongEdit 1strong After Peteshs comment I played around with the Time Profiler in Instruments a bit more and discovered I could set the Inspection Range and look at only at code run after I put the app in the suspended state. I found some code that shouldnt have been running and I fixed it, but the app is still kicked out of the suspended state after just a few minutesp  pThe Activity Monitor now reveals only 0.10 CPU usage while the app is backgrounded. Running the Time Profiler again reveals that the only thing running is the main run loop I think. 277ms over about an hour of time in the background. If I check the Invert Call Tree box it reveals the time is mostly spent in machmsgtrap with 46ms total over that hour. Im not sure if this is normal behavior or not.p  pIve solved some part of my question, but the most important part remains. What is preventing my app from staying in the suspended statep  pstrongEdit 2 FIXEDstrong After some deeper digging Ive found the culprit. A third party library was calling codebeginBackgroundTaskWithExpirationHandlercode and then never calling codeendBackgroundTaskcode when it was finished. Therefore, I believe iOS thought the app was still trying to do a background task and after a certain background time was up it just terminated the app even though it wasnt really doing anything.p  pThe Activity Monitor in Instruments now really shows 0 the entire time after the initial background code is run.p  pIm not sure if it was just this or a combination of all the things I fixed since I first asked this question, but either way, its fixedp  pstrongEDIT 3strong After even a bit more research I found out it wasnt actually the third party librarys fault. The library was listening for the applicationDidEnterBackground notification so it could flush its queue. But in our own applicationDidEnterBackground we also had a force flush for the queue. Therefore it was trying to start the background task twice and only finishing it only once. Oopsp

Negative 3995 pThe html page I made is pixel perfect  everything is well calculated for   the total width of the page is 980px and page is designed so that the total width of the components add up to be 980px.p  pEvery image container is relatively positioned to allow the hidden div to slide down display on hover and the size  of the container of the image is based on the exact size of the image inside it.p  pI have defined right margins  5px for each containerdiv class mainContX01  at the top row, except the last.  And  right margins  4px for each containerdiv class mainContX02  at the bottom. I calculate the total sum of the width of every div  padding etc it adds up to be 980px. everything is accounted for.p  pWhen i preview it on my system everything works fine  the layout works, everything is aligned.p  pBut when the same html file is uploaded on the main website, the layout breaks and I am forced to reduce the margin between the relative containers just to make it work.p  pI spent my whole day trying to find out the reason behind this but I could find nothing that could explain it.p  pIs it because I used box shadow to define the stroke.But they are supposed to be dimensionless Is it because of the extra styling being applied from the main server HTML which encloses my HTMLBut I used CSS reset.p  pPlease help me with this. I dont know what to do. Should i always add an extra pixel to the total width while designing HTML pages I am at such a loss.p  pHere is the [fiddle link] a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netQ4HfL2 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netQ4HfL2ap  pbp  precodeltdiv idholiFashionRedwrapper stylewidth980pxmargin0 autogt ltdiv classcontRow clearfixgt ltdiv classfLeftgt Image goes hereltdivgt ltdiv classinnerBoxCont clearfix stylewidth623pxheight279pxfloatleftgt lta hrefgt ltdiv classmainContX01gt ltdiv classshowContgt ltdiv classoverlayBGsmall clearfixgt ltdivgt ltdiv classofferContSmallgt Womens Footwearltbr gt ltdivgt ltdiv classshopNowMaingt ltspan classshopNowTextgtshop nowltspangt ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv classmainImg clearfixgt ltimg srchttpi.sdlcdn.comimgmarketingmailerslandingpage2014coloroftheday10marchimageswomensFootwear.jpg width309 height137 altwomensFootwear gtltdivgt ltdivgtltagt lta href targetblankgt ltdiv classmainContX01 clearfix lastgt ltdiv classshowContgt ltdiv classoverlayBGsmall clearfixgt ltdivgt ltdiv classofferContSmallgt Handbags ltdivgt ltdiv classshopNowMaingt ltspan classshopNowTextgtshop nowltspangt ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv classmainImg clearfixgt ltimg srchttpi.sdlcdn.comimgmarketingmailerslandingpage2014coloroftheday10marchimagesbags.jpg width309 height137 altHandbags gtltdivgt ltdivgtltagt lta hrefgt ltdiv classmainContX01gt ltdiv classshowContgt ltdiv classoverlayBGsmall clearfixgt ltdivgt ltdiv classofferContSmallgt Accessories ltdivgt ltdiv classshopNowMaingt ltspan classshopNowTextgtshop nowltspangt ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv classmainImg clearfixgt ltimg srchttpi.sdlcdn.comimgmarketingmailerslandingpage2014coloroftheday10marchimagesties.jpg width309 height137 altTies gtltdivgt ltdivgtltagt lta hrefgt ltdiv classmainContX01 clearfix lastgt ltdiv classshowContgt ltdiv classoverlayBGsmall clearfixgt ltdivgt ltdiv classofferContSmallgt Fashion Jewellery ltdivgt ltdiv classshopNowMaingt ltspan classshopNowTextgtshop nowltspangt ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv classmainImg clearfixgt ltimg srchttpi.sdlcdn.comimgmarketingmailerslandingpage2014coloroftheday10marchimagesearings.jpg width309 height137 altEarings gtltdivgt ltdivgtltagt ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv classcontRow clearfixgt lta hrefgt ltdiv classmainContX02gt ltdiv classshowContgt ltdiv classoverlayBGsmall clearfixgt ltdivgt ltdiv classofferContSmallgt Dresses ltdivgt ltdiv classshopNowMaingt ltspan classshopNowTextgtshop nowltspangt ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv classmainImg clearfixgt ltimg srchttpi.sdlcdn.comimgmarketingmailerslandingpage2014coloroftheday10marchimagesapparels.jpg width240 height259 altWomens Apparel Western gtltdivgt ltdivgtltagt lta hrefgt ltdiv classmainContX02gt ltdiv classshowContgt ltdiv classoverlayBGsmall clearfixgt ltdivgt ltdiv classofferContSmallgt Tshirts ltdivgt ltdiv classshopNowMaingt ltspan classshopNowTextgtshop nowltspangt ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv classmainImg clearfixgt ltimg srchttpi.sdlcdn.comimgmarketingmailerslandingpage2014coloroftheday10marchimagesmensApparels.jpg width240 height259 altMens Apparel gtltdivgt ltdivgtltagt lta hrefgt ltdiv classmainContX02gt ltdiv classshowContgt ltdiv classoverlayBGsmall clearfixgt ltdivgt ltdiv classofferContSmallgt Kurtis ltdivgt ltdiv classshopNowMaingt ltspan classshopNowTextgtshop nowltspangt ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv classmainImg clearfixgt ltimg srchttpi.sdlcdn.comimgmarketingmailerslandingpage2014coloroftheday10marchimageswomensApparel2.jpg width240 height259 altWomens Apparel Ethnic gtltdivgt ltdivgtltagt lta hrefgt ltdiv classmainContX02 lastgt ltdiv classshowContgt ltdiv classoverlayBGsmall clearfixgt ltdivgt ltdiv classofferContSmallgt Mens Footwear ltdivgt ltdiv classshopNowMaingt ltspan classshopNowTextgtshop nowltspangt ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv classmainImg clearfixgt ltimg srchttpi.sdlcdn.comimgmarketingmailerslandingpage2014coloroftheday10marchimagesmensFootwear.jpg width240 height259 altMens Footwear gtltdivgt ltdivgtltagtltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pbp

Negative 3995 pIm working on an application that stores data in CouchDB and I want to generate UUIDs for new documents within the application, i.e. without using the a hrefhttpscouchdb.readthedocs.orgenlatestapiservercommon.htmluuids relnofollowuuida API or relying on UUIDs to be generated by CouchDB when the documents are inserted. To do this, Im going to recreate the default algorithm that CouchDB uses to generate UUIDs, which works as followsp  pemA generated UUID consists of two parts, a random prefix and a monotonically increasing suffix. The same prefix is used for as long as the suffix doesnt overflow, if it does, a new random prefix is used. The suffix starts at zero and is increased in random steps between 1 and 0xffe.emp  pThis all seems reasonable, especially the part about the random but constant prefix that allows documents that are inserted at the same time to be stored near each other in the document BTree. What I dont understand is why the suffix is increased in random steps instead of just 1 each time. What is the explanation, or a possible explanation, for this decisionp

Negative 3995 pI have the following scenario p  ul lipServices Web Project Web Applicationp  ul liServiceA.svcli liServiceB.svcli liExceptionResponseMessage.csli ulli lipInterface Web project Web Application p  ul liService References ul liServiceAServiceReferenceli liServiceBServiceReferenceli ulli ulli ul  pIn both services A and B i have methods that returns the ExceptionResponseMessage class. In the interface web project, wich Ill call client, for easy reference, this class is generated two times p  ul liServiceAServiceReference.ExceptionResponseMessageli liServiceBServiceReference.ExceptionResponseMessageli ul  pId like to create a function in my client that will handle the response Message to see if there is any error and handle it correctly. Since i have two copies of the class, i would have to create two methods p  precodepublic static void HandleErrorServiceAServiceReference.ExceptionResponseMessage ex      Method Implementation here   public static void HandleErrorServiceBServiceReference.ExceptionResponseMessage ex      Method Implementation here  codepre  pId like to avoid that, so i created an Interface in a different class library Project, wich both Services and client project can access. The ExceptionResponseMessage implements this Interfaces. p  pThe problem is that the client generated classes for ExceptionResponseMessage, does not implements the interface. Ive even created a self referencing InnerException property in the interface and in the object, like this p  precodepublic interface IExceptionResponseMessage      IExceptionResponseMessage InnerException  get set    public class ExceptionResponseMessage  IExceptionResponseMessage      public IExceptionResponseMessage InnerException  get set   codepre  pBut when i check the client generated object, it says the InnerException property is of type Object, wich shows the interface is not being respected in client. p  pDoes anyone know how can i make the client classes implement the interfacep
Negative 3995 pI have method codeacode that is invoked repeatedly at some random time, which triggers method codebcode, which is completely executed after some random time and is in it own thread. I want to ensure that a subsequent execution of codeacode waits until codebcode is completed, which is triggered by the current execution of codeacode. In other words, codeacode and codebcode are to be executed alternatively. I tried to do this using mutex and condition variable as followsp  precodedef a   Thread.new do     mutex.synchronize do       puts a       b       cv.waitmutex     end   end end  def b   Thread.new do     sleeprand     mutex.synchronize do       puts b       cv.signal     end   end end  mutex, cv  Mutex.new, ConditionVariable.new loopa sleeprand codepre  pIn this code, codemutex.synchronize do ... endcode in method codeacode ensures that codecv.signalcode also within another codemutex.synchronize do ... endcode in method codebcode is not invoked until codecv.waitmutexcode sets codecvcode into listening mode for signals. This much is given in a hrefhttprubydoc.orgstdlib2.0.0libdocthreadrdocConditionVariable.html relnofollowthe documenta.p  pAnother function I intended to assign to codemutex.synchronize do ... endcode in method codeacode is to avoid consecutive execution of method codeacode. My reasoning is that codecv.waitmutexcode in method codeacode should avoid codemutexcode from being completed and released until codecv.signalcode in method codebcode is invoked, by which time codebcode should be finished.p  pI expected that codeacode and codebcode are executed alternatively, thereby printing codeacode and codebcode alternatively. But in reality, they are not each of codeacode or codebcode can be printed consecutively.p  hr  pAfter that, I thought that my reasoning above may be wrong in the sense that codemutexcode is rather completed and released even if codecvcode or codemutexcode is in waiting mode, once codecv.waitmutexcode has been strongcalledstrong. So I added some dummy process to codeacode, changing it top  precodedef a   Thread.new do     mutex.synchronize do       puts a       b       cv.waitmutex       nil  Dummy process intended to keep mutex locked until cv is released     end   end end codepre  pbut that did not have effect.p  hr  pHow can this be fixed Or, what am I wrong about thisp

Negative 3995 pWe decided to implement a search functionality in our API which is developed in ServiceStack, we decided to use Lucene.Net since we heard it was a great indexer to make searches.p  pWe created a worker role whose job is to create the indexes in a Azure Storage folder, we guided ourselves using a hrefhttpleoncullens.nlpost20121118FullTextSearchonAzurewithLuceneNET.aspx relnofollowLeon Cullens tutoriala. We use the a hrefhttpsgithub.comazurecontribAzureDirectory relnofollowAzureDirectory librarya specified in that post, so we could use the latest Azure SDK.p  pThen in our API project we added the references for Lucene.Net and AzureDirectory too, our endpoint ended up looking like thisp  precode    public object PostSearchIndex request                          ListltProductgt products  new ListltProductgt          var pageSize  1         var totalpages  1         int.TryParseConfigurationManager.AppSettings[PageSize], out pageSize          if request.Page.Equals0                       request.Page  1                    Get Azure settings         AzureDirectory azureDirectory           try                       This is the line where we get the Access denied exception thrown at us             azureDirectory  new AzureDirectoryMicrosoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.CloudStorageAccount.ParseConfigurationManager.AppSettings[ConnectionStringAzureSearch], indexsearch               IndexSearcher searcher             using new AutoStopWatchCreating searcher                              searcher  new IndexSearcherazureDirectory                           using new AutoStopWatchstring.FormatSearch for 0, request.SearchString                              string[] searchfields  new string[]  Id, Name, Description                   var hits  searcher.SearchQueryMakerrequest.SearchString, searchfields, request.Page  pageSize                  int count  hits.ScoreDocs.Count                 float temptotalpages  0                 temptotalpages  floathits.ScoreDocs.Count  floatpageSize                  if temptotalpages gt inttemptotalpages                                      totalpages  inttemptotalpages  1                                  else                                      totalpages  inttemptotalpages                                   foreach ScoreDoc match in hits.ScoreDocs                                      Document doc  searcher.Docmatch.Doc                      int producId  int.Parsedoc.GetId                      Product product  Db.SelectltProductgtId0, producId.FirstOrDefault                      products.Addproduct                                             return new SearchIndexResult  result  products.Skipintrequest.Page  1  10.TakepageSize.ToList, PageSize  pageSize, TotalPages  totalpages                   catch Exception e                       return new HttpResultHttpStatusCode.NoContent, azureDirectory.

But when we published our API to Azure and tried to access to the search endpoint we received an 403 error message with the message Access to the path DAzureDirectory is denied.p  pWere confused as to why is trying to access to such folder at all, the name of the folder is wrong and I think its trying to access a local route, we really dont know why does it work fine locally but once its deployed to Azure it stops working.p  pThe worker role runs without a problems, but its the API side that cannot access to the folder in Azure Storage. Are we missing some important step in the configuration The tutorial we followed wasnt very clear for beginners using Lucene.Net or Azure Storage so we fear we might have missed an important step. Weve checked our connection strings and everything seems ok though.p

Negative 3995 pI have just started using Enthought Canopy v1.4.9 64 bit for Windows instead of IDLE.  I am a complete beginner and teaching myself python from various online courses.p  pWhen I run scripts in IDLE the output scrolls to the bottom of the IDLE screen, so if I am asking for rawinput multiple times the user can see what input is being asked for each time and just enter it without having to manually scroll down to the bottom of the output before entering their input.  However, in Canopy the output does not scroll all the way to the bottom of the Python window.p  pIs there any command I can put in a script to tell if to automatically scroll to the bottomp  pIve tried to search for how to do this online but could only find tutorials on setting up scroll bars.p
Negative 3995 pIve decided to programmatically create my own codeUITableViewcode separator lines because I need fine control over displaying a separator above andor below each individual codeUITableViewCellcode. My codetableViewcode has static cells, so I do not create the separators in codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode. Instead, I have codepropertycodes for each cell and in codeviewDidLoadcode, I add a top andor bottom separator as needed. Its working, until I rotate to landscape and then the separator line does not stretch to fill the screen  it of course remains the same width it was when created. Im not seeing how I can automatically adjust them to fit the width of the screen.p  pI tried adding Auto Layout constraints leading, trailing, topbottom, but for some reason its not working  the width does not change, but there are no error messages logged to indicate anything is wrong with the constraints. The separator lines also sometimes disappear upon scroll or rotate, and if I comment out the auto layout constraints then they do not disappear.p  pSo how can I make my custom cell separators always stretch to fill the device width upon rotation, and how do I prevent them from disappearingp  pIf it would be easierbetter to create my custom cell separators in a different way, I am willing to do that. I just dont know how this can be done aside from my approach when the cells are static. I considered creating the views in the Storyboard, and setting up the constraints visually, but would that not be the equivalent of what Im doing programmatically If they were dynamic cells I would do it in codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode.p  precodeIn viewDidLoad [self addTopSeparatorForCellself.myCell]  Helper method  voidaddTopSeparatorForCellUITableViewCell cell      UIView topSeparator  [[UIView alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake15, 1, cell.contentView.frame.size.width, 0.5]      add CALayer to preserve line separator visibility when row is highlighted     CALayer backgroundColorLayer  [CALayer layer]     backgroundColorLayer.frame  topSeparator.bounds     backgroundColorLayer.backgroundColor  [UIColor colorWithWhite204255.0f alpha1].CGColor      [topSeparator.layer addSublayerbackgroundColorLayer]      [cell.contentView addSubviewtopSeparator]      add auto layout constraints     topSeparator.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints  NO     NSLayoutConstraint cn  nil     cn  [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItemtopSeparator                                       attributeNSLayoutAttributeLeading                                       relatedByNSLayoutRelationEqual                                          toItemcell.contentView                                       attributeNSLayoutAttributeLeading                                      multiplier1.0                                        constant15]     [cell.contentView addConstraintcn]     cn  [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItemtopSeparator                                       attributeNSLayoutAttributeTrailing                                       relatedByNSLayoutRelationEqual                                          toItemcell.contentView                                       attributeNSLayoutAttributeTrailing                                      multiplier1.0                                        constant0]     [cell.contentView addConstraintcn]     cn  [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItemtopSeparator                                       attributeNSLayoutAttributeTop                                       relatedByNSLayoutRelationEqual                                          toItemcell.contentView                                       attributeNSLayoutAttributeTop                                      multiplier1.0                                        constant1]     [cell.contentView addConstraintcn]  codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comguFND.png altenter image description herep  pstrongEDITstrong Thanks to  user1966109, weve been able to solve the issue with the lines not extending to fill the width, and now they are preserved when highlighting a cell. But one issue still remains that I havent been able to solve, since Im not sure why its occurring. The separator lines disappear after scrolling down the scrolling back up. Its related to the auto layout constraints though because a previous solution which had other issues did not exhibit this problem. Heres the current solution that causes the lines to disappear.

Negative 3995 pstrongQuestion summarystrongp  pI have a page which displays an html table with cells approximately 100px per 100px.  This table can be anywhere from 1 columnrow to N columnsrows but I need to create a system which correctly prints this document across all browsers.p  pstrongWhat I have tried so farstrongp  pMy current solution utilises this answer from another SO question  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma19582173781884httpstackoverflow.coma19582173781884ap  pstrongProblem with current solutionstrongp  pThis solution does work relatively well in certain situations using Chrome.  The problem is a lot of our users use IE7 and it does not work well, especially when printing large tables.p  pstrongPossible solutions I hadstrongp  ol liCreate a button which utilises the current system but it cuts the page at multiple different widths to allow printing in horizontal  vertical  a3 horizontal and vertical.  This is most definitely the quickest fix but it still leaves the possibility that IE7 doesnt work properly and it prints a table which makes no sense at all which happens under certain conditionsli liCreate a PDF file of the page multiple different size variations included to allow the user to export the size they require.  The problem with this is the time that I will need to invest to see how this can be done and to overcome any issues we have with very large tables.  This is by far the most risky in terms of investement  benefitli liThe third option is obviously to scrap the whole idea and change the logic of the page to not have a table but display the data in a different manner. This would preferably be avoided. li ol

I know that we can add custom fields to any state like pageTitlep  precode.stateapp.home,      url ,     templateUrl templateshome.html,     controller HomeController,     pageTitle Home  codepre  pand then we could retrieve that on codestateChangeSuccesscode and set it to the codescopecodep  precode.run[     rootScope, function rootScope        use strict        rootScope.appState  rootScope.appState          rootScope.onstateChangeSuccess, function event, toState, toParams, fromState, fromParams         TODO We need to update the title and meta here, and then retrieve it and assign it to appState       rootScope.appState.pageTitle  toState.pageTitle    ] codepre  p, and then on our index.html dop  precodelttitle ngbindappState.pageTitlegtPage Title before the dynamic title kicks inlttitlegt codepre  pHowever, in our case, the page title has to come form the DB, via calling our Node.js REST API. For example, imagine, you go on a product page, you have to get the product, to get the title of the product to set the page title. Any ideas how we could do that p  pCheers,br Iraklisp

Negative 3995 pI have a Rails 3.2.18 app that Im having a problem with.p  pBasically each record is a Call, and each Call has many units.  A unit being a vehicle which has a status such as In service, Out of Service, etc.p  pWhen creating a call I want only the units that are marked as In Service to be listed for dispatch.  So I created a scope on the Unit model that scopes thatp  pUnit.rbp  precodescope inservice, lambda  wherestatusid Status.findbyunitstatusIn Service.id codepre  pIn my Calls Helper I have a method which selects the Units and appends their unit type and whether or not they are active on another call so dispatchers wont be tempted to doubledispatch a unit.p  pcallshelper.rbp  precodedef unitselect     Unit.active.orderunitname.mapunit unit.calls.wherecallstatus open.empty  [unit.unitname unit.unittype.unittype, unit.id]  [unit.unitname on call unit.unittype.unittype, unit.id]  end codepre  pHeres where the problem comes in.  If I change the helper method to the followingp  precodedef unitselect     Unit.active.inservice.orderunitname.mapunit unit.calls.wherecallstatus open.empty  [unit.unitname unit.unittype.unittype, unit.id]  [unit.unitname on call unit.unittype.unittype, unit.id]  end codepre  pAppending the inservice scope method to the unitselect helper, it does indeed select only units that are in service.  This is fine, but when you go to edit the call and if the unit has changed its status since the calls creation, the unit is then pulled off the record in the formp  pform.html.erbp  precodelt f.selectunitids, unitselect,  , multiple gt true, class gt select gt codepre  pI get why this is happening, as the form is selecting based off of units that have a status of In Service, but I need to figure out how to get the Unit assignment to persist in the form.p  pSo with some help from a friend we came up with this for the helper methodp  precodedef unitselect call.units.toa  Unit.active.inservice.orderunitname.mapunit unit.calls.wherecallstatus open.empty  [unit.unitname unit.unittype.unittype, unit.id]  [unit.unitname on call unit.unittype.unittype, unit.id]  end codepre  pNow this works, and the Unit persists in the form when you edit regardless of the Units status.  Heres where things get weird.p  pLets say you edit the record and want to pull the unit off and assign a different unit.  It wont allow you to do that.  It will continue to keep the value of call.unitids no matter what I do.p  pHere is what the association looks like Call.rbp  precodehasmany callunits hasmany units, through callunits codepre  pUnit.rbp  precodehasmany callunits hasmany calls, through callunits codepre  pOn top of this I found another problem when creating a return call.  Basically taking the original call data and creating a return trip based off the initial call.  When creating a return trip it will assign the same unitid to the call twice in an array.  So it looks like there are two units on the call but they are really the same unit listed twice.  Here is what my return action looks like in the controller.p  pcallscontroller.rbp  precodedef newreturn     originalcall  Call.findparams[id]     call  Call.new       callername originalcall.callername,       specialequipmentids originalcall.specialequipmentids,       callstatus open,       callerphone originalcall.callerphone,       transferfromid originalcall.transfertoid,       transferfromother originalcall.transfertoother,       facilityfromlocation originalcall.facilitytolocation,       transfertoid originalcall.transferfromid,       transfertoother originalcall.transferfromother,       facilitytolocation originalcall.facilityfromlocation,       patientname originalcall.patientname,       patientage originalcall.patientage,       patientdob originalcall.patientdob,       patientsexid originalcall.patientsexid,       insuranceid originalcall.insuranceid,       natureid originalcall.natureid,       servicelevelid originalcall.servicelevelid,       specialequipmentids originalcall.specialequipmentids,       transferdate originalcall.transferdate,       unitids originalcall.unitids,       waitreturn yes,       parentcallid params[id],         end codepre  pSo to summarize, I have found a halfway working way to limit only In Service units to be dispatched onto calls but face the following problemsp  ol liCannot remove a unit from the callli liWhen editing a call a unit wont display in the form unless the unit is In Service status.li liWhen creating a return call, it duplicates the unitid into an array in call.unitids so the unit displays on the call twice.li ol  pSo Id like to be able to select only In Service units on a new call, have the unit show up in the form when editing regardless of its status, and also on the return call only have the unitids contain one instance of the unitid that is supposed to be assigned.p  pI know this is really confusing and would be happy to pair up with someone, chat, or build a gist so you can see my codebase.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated, as right now Im hitting a wall.p  pstrongUpdate 1044amstrongp  pIve tried adding .uniq on the units array and I still have the problem.

Negative 3995 pBeen having trouble finding an elegant solution to my problem.p  pFor example I have two panes left and right. Left and right panes each occupy 50 of their parent container. Both have no horizontal scroll bar, only vertical.p  pIn the right pane, there are different sections. User scrolls vertically to section 10. User then hides the left pane, this will cause the right pane to occupy the space of the left, doubling its width. The content of the right pane will be distributed to occupy the space. In case the left pane is toggled to be shown again, the right panes content will condensewrap.p  pThe issue is when the right panes width is changed due to toggling of the left, the current section being viewed is changed since the vertical scroll position of the right pane changes due to the change in available space. It jumps around 2 sections.p  pYou guys think of any elegant solution such that on resize of the right pane, there will be minimal changes in the sections viewable to the user Thanks Sorry cant post screen shots or codes.p  pEdit added images.

Id prefer to keep the views for both forms separate. p  pHeres the home page and signin viewsp  precode appshomeviews def homepagerequest, template     signinform  SignInAuthenticationForm     signupform  CreateAccountForm     return renderrequest, template, signinform signinform,                                       signupform signupform  sensitivepostparameters csrfprotect nevercache def signinrequest,              templatehomepage.html,             redirectfieldnameREDIRECTFIELDNAME,              authenticationformAuthenticationForm,             authenticationformSignInAuthenticationForm,             currentappNone, extracontextNone       Do device detection here...      django.contrib.auth.views code goes here...      return response codepre  pThe signup view will just be your typical, functionbased view for processing a form as described in the Django a hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comen1.6topicsformsusingaforminaview relnofollowdocumentationa.p  pWhat Im struggling with is my URLconf files.

Maybe I needed to do this to match the arguments in the signin viewp  precodeltform action url apps.home.views.signin homehomepage.html  methodpostgt codepre  pBut Im already showing the template name in the home URLconf.  And I dont think I need to pass the other view arguments in the form action e.g. redirectfieldname because their  optional.  In any case, adding this argument to the form action didnt fix it.p  pOne of the things that confuses me is how to set the first url argument.  Ive set them to rsignin and rsignup because if I set them both to r, the page will render properly but when I submit either form, it justs posts back to the home page.  You can see this will happen by doing a view source on the page. It shows each forms action will be .  On the other hand, the way I have it now seems incorrect to me because the site wont actually have a signin and signup URL since both forms are on the home page.  Also, is there going to be a problem in which if the user submits one for or the other improperly, errors for both forms will be rendered on the page  p  pThe Django documentation, to the best of my knowledge, doesnt really describe a standard approach for doing what Im trying to do.  It describes how to render multiple versions of the same form.  Can anyone tell me what Im doing wrongp  pThanks.p

Negative 3995 pI am using the Eclipse Android IDE, downloaded from the Android site ADT v22.6.2, Mac, OS X.  p  pWhen I first launch the program, it is quick to open new files and make modifications, but very rapidly slows down and becomes quite laggy.  Opening project files becomes so slow that one wonders if the IDE crashed or frozeup.  Editing said project files is equally painful...  p  pFor example, clicking into a nonfucused windowtab to insert the cursor takes a solid 510 seconds or more of delay before it appears and modifications can be made, and saving files can take up to 10 seconds or more for a single file.p  pstrongWhy is thisstrong  Why does it start off nice and quick, but so rapidly degrade in performance  Restarting ADT will bring the speed up a bit, but each successive launch of it brings the overall performance down to the point where only restarting the computer can bring it back up.p  pIve had similar issues back when I was coding in MatLab and using their WYSIWYG GUI builder.  Eventually the system got bogged down with all the components being drawn on the screen that it would freeze up and youd have to restart the software and sometimes the computer.p  pEclipse is very powerful, and Id be lost without it, but it would be nice to maintain consistent performance from it without multiple software and system restarts.  Is there a fix, or is everyone succumbing to the same problemp

Negative 3995 pIs there yet any native or commonlyaccepted approaches to using environment variables to control Docker behaviour, i.e. in a 12factor mannerp  pThe only languageagnostic method Ive seen is to pollute the docker run command with e variables.

Negative 3995 pI have installed Eclipse Java EE Luna Release 4.4.0 and App Engine SDK 1.9.10 I have created a new Google  Web Application Project and selected the Generate Project Sample Code option. I changed nothing about the project. The generated project successfully deploys and runs locally. However when I deploy this to AppSpot I get an error message Remote Procedure Call  Failure when clicking on the Send button on the sample form. Are there other steps I need to perform in order for the generated project to be successfully deployed to AppSpot My goal is to have a starting application that deploys so I can start learning to use Objectify and GWT to build applications. If there is a better way to go about this please suggest it. Kind regards Seanp

Negative 3995 pThis question uses Java examples, but it deals with a problem that is applicable to any OOP. I want to expose some webservices so other applications can use them. I created a jarlibrary file which handles all the connection stuff and the conversion between stringxml to pojo. I created a facade class which has 1 method for each invokable webservice. E.g. in pseudocodep  precodeclass ServiceInvoker      constructor    ...     methods    public ListltProductgt getProducts    public ProductReference getProductReferencesint productId    ...  codepre  pProblem is, most of the webservices require a bunch of parameters. For example, whenever youre dealing with products you either get full detailed information, or you can get only the most basic information. Same for only recentold information. It is more performant to get only a few products but sometimes you really need more information so to parameters exist to cater all use cases in the best way. I found 3 possible ways of dealing with this.p  ol liAdd the necessary parameters to each method call. Advantage simple to understand, it is clear when invoking the method what youre settings are.li liCreate a few setters in the ServiceInvoker like thisli ol  blockquote   ppublic void setInfoModeInfomode mode                   this.infoMode  mode       p blockquote  pWhere InfoMode would be an enum class like this InfoMode.DETAILED, InfoMode.BASIC. The advantage of this scheme is that developers only have to set the mode once and then all future service invocations would use that mode. This can save a whole bunch of arguments in several methods, especially because some services can share settings and it is likely the same service is invoked multiple times. The main disadvantage of this scheme is clarity when calling the service getProducts, the response can vary wildly depending on earlier set modes. The earlier said advantage would be lost if developers had to do some preprocessing like thisp  precodeif serviceInvoker.getInfoMode  InfoMode.DETAILED      serviceInvoker.setInfoModeInfoMode.DETAILED  codepre  pBecause this is more complex than simply passing the modes along as an argument.p  pThe third option would be to combine both 1 and 2. Have a method without parameters, that uses the modes set earlier, but also provide a method with does takes arguments and these would temporarily overwrite the set modes for that method invocation. The disadvantage of this scheme is the doubling of all methods. Suddenly my invoker class becomes huge and it starts to smell like the antipattern huge god class.p  pWhat are some best practices around this issue Do design pattern exists for this situationp

Negative 3995 pAssume that I have a Python function that takes several arguments as input and returns an output.p  pNow I would like to have a webservice API based on this function.

Everything seems to work fine, except for the timestamp of each packet being invalid.p  pSimply put, I store the timestamp in a bytebuffer along with all the other data and write it to a file. When I then inspect the file using a hex editor I get the following value for the timestamp fieldp  precodeByteBuffer data  ByteBuffer.allocateepbLength.orderByteOrder.BIGENDIAN data.putlongtimestamp  00 00 01 49 D3 7F B4 D9 gt 1416592602329 According to Hex Fiend codepre  pThis seems like a valid timestamp. However, opening the file in Wireshark I get a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comsz3bveedyrvifhw6Screenshot20201411212009.58.27.pngdl0 relnofollowJanuary 12, 46860ap  pLooking at the PCAPNG specification regarding timestamp it states the followingp  blockquote   pTimestamp High and Timestamp Low high and low 32bits of a    64bit quantity representing the timestamp. The timestamp is a  single   64bit unsigned integer representing the number of units  since   111970 000000 UTC. The way to interpret this field is  specified   by the iftsresol option see Figure 9 of the  Interface   Description block referenced by this packet. Please  note that   differently from the libpcap file format, timestamps are  not saved as   two 32bit values accounting for the seconds and  microseconds since   111970. They are saved as a single 64bit  quantity saved as two   32bit words.p blockquote  pSo I am assuming that it is wrong for me to simply store the value as a long in the bytebuffer and then save it to a file. But how am I supposed to save a timestamp as two 32 bit words I have tried different things like simply storing the value as two ints but nothing seems to give me the right format.p  pNote that I also specify iftsresol, in the packet, but no matter what value I give it 3 for 103  millis it does not affect the way Wireshark interprets the file. p  pAnother thing to note, is that if I store the timestamp as seconds, I do get a valid timestamp in wireshark. As seen a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comsujudor2bp1suim8Screenshot20201411212010.25.52.pngdl0 relnofollowherea However, the milliseconds are discarded, meaning that the ordering of all packets received within the same second cannot be resolved given the timestamp.p  pAs a reference, here is a timestamp field taken from a wireshark TCP capture earlierp  precode86 07 05 00 5A A5 4C F8 codepre  pSomehow I need to store my timestamp like they do.p  pThe latest PCAP specification draft can be found a hrefhttptools.ietf.orgpdfdrafttuexenopswgpcapng00.pdf relnofollowhereap

Negative 3995 pI have a websocket server that I have messages being sent to from a queue of bytebuffers in java.

Sometimes the first and second message get sent sometimes only the first message gets sent. I know that the message is getting sent due to that wireshark shows me the messages are being sent 100 of the time but not received every time as stated. Why might this being happening when I do concurrent writes on a websocket that the receiving end would not always receive the message I am using tomcat 7.0.53p

Negative 3995 pIm creating a simple web app that has a user login.  Im trying to use Spring Security to manage authorization and I want to know if it is possible to use SS without setting up roles.  There is no admin or special permissions, a user is either logged in or they arent.  p  pAll tutorials I found make you setup a roles table and userroles join table in your database and the same entities in your files.  This seems like overkill for what I want.  Is it possible to just use SS to check a username and password and log the user in if they match what is in the database without doing all the role stuffp

Negative 3995 pThis question has been driving me crazy and I cant get my head around it. I come from a MySQL relational background and have been using Meteorjs and Mongo. For the purposes of this question take the example of posts and authors. One Author to Many Posts. I have come up with two ways in which to do thisp  ol lipHave a single collection of posts  Each post has the author information embedded into the document. This of course leads to denormalization and issues such as if the author name changes how do you keep the data correct.pli lipHave two collections posts and authors  Each post has an author ID which references the authors collection. I then attempt to do a join on a non relational database while trying to maintain reactivity.pli ol  pIt seems to me with MongoDB degrees of denormalization is acceptable and I am tempted to embed as implementing joins really does feel like going against the ideals of Mongo.p  pCan anyone shed any light on what is the right approach especially in terms of wanting my app data to scale well and be manageablep  pThanksp

Negative 3995 pMy ASP.NET application allows users to login and access certain information from the website. These users are basically belonging to multiple roles e.g I have roles like Administrators, Power Users and Guests. The users are allowed to modify or view data on the .aspx page as per their roles. I read through about Role Management in ASP.NET on MSN. What I could figure out is that the pages related to each role are sorted into a separate folder, i.e I need to have sub folders like Administrators, Power Users and Guests. So when a user logs in he is redirected to the pages in the role he belongs to. Am I right Here the drawback is that if I need to make some changes to the Administrator folder, I will as well need to make the same changes to other folders. This would make it very cumbersome and difficult to track sometimes. Is there some other way we can do this Thanks amp Regards, Sarin Gopalanp

Negative 3995 pIn order to calculate the projection view matrix for a directional light I take the vertices of the frustum of my active camera, multiply them by the rotation of my directional light and use these rotated vertices to calculate the extends of an orthographic projection matrix for my directional light. Then I create the view matrix using the center of my lights frustum bounding box as the position of the eye, the lights direction for the forward vector and then the Y axis as the up vector.p  pI calculate the camera frustum vertices by multiplying the 8 corners of a box with 2 as size and centered in the origin.p  pEverything works fine and the direction light projection view matrix is correct but Ive encountered a big issue with this method.p  pLets say that my camera is facing forward 0, 0, 1, positioned on the origin and with a zNear value of 1 and zFar of 100. Only objects visible from my camera frustum are rendered into the shadow map, so every object that has a Z position between 1 and 100. p  pThe problem is, if my light has a direction which makes the light come from behind the camera and the is an object, for example, with a Z position of 10 so behind the camera but still in front of the light and tall enough to possibly cast a shadow on the scene visible from my camera, this object is not rendered into the shadow map because its not included into my light frustum, resulting in an error not casting the shadow.p  pIn order to solve this problem I was thinking of using the scene bounding box to calculate the light projection view Matrix, but doing this would be useless because the image rendered into the shadow map cuold be so large that numerous artifacts would be visible shadow acne, etc..., so I skipped this solution.p  pHow could I overcome this problem p  hr  pIve read a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopee416324vvs.85.aspx relnofollowthis posta under the section of Calculating a tight projection to create my projection view matrix and, for clarity, this is my codep  precodeFrustum cameraFrustum  activeCameragtGetFrustum  Vertex3f direction  GetDirection                                         z axis Vertex3f perpVec1  direction  Vertex3f0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f.Normalized   y axis Vertex3f perpVec2  direction  perpVec1.Normalized                     x axis  Matrix rotationMatrix   rotationMatrix.m[0]  perpVec2.x   rotationMatrix.m[1]  perpVec1.x   rotationMatrix.m[2]    direction.x rotationMatrix.m[4]  perpVec2.y   rotationMatrix.m[5]  perpVec1.y   rotationMatrix.m[6]    direction.y rotationMatrix.m[8]  perpVec2.z   rotationMatrix.m[9]  perpVec1.z   rotationMatrix.m[10]   direction.z  Vertex3f frustumVertices[8] cameraFrustumgtGetFrustumVerticesfrustumVertices  for AInt i  0 i lt 8 i     frustumVertices[i]  rotationMatrix  frustumVertices[i]  Vertex3f minV  frustumVertices[0], maxV  frustumVertices[0] for AInt i  1 i lt 8 i      minV.x  minminV.x, frustumVertices[i].x     minV.y  minminV.y, frustumVertices[i].y     minV.z  minminV.z, frustumVertices[i].z     maxV.x  maxmaxV.x, frustumVertices[i].x     maxV.y  maxmaxV.y, frustumVertices[i].y     maxV.z  maxmaxV.z, frustumVertices[i].z   Vertex3f extends  maxV  minV extends  0.5f  Matrix viewMatrix  MatrixMakeLookAtcameraFrustumgtGetBoundingBoxCenter, direction, perpVec1 Matrix projectionMatrix  MatrixMakeOrthoextends.x, extends.x, extends.y, extends.y, extends.z, extends.z Matrix projectionViewMatrix  projectionMatrix  viewMatrix  SceneObjectSetMatrixViewMatrix, viewMatrix SceneObjectSetMatrixProjectionMatrix, projectionMatrix SceneObjectSetMatrixProjectionViewMatrix, projectionViewMatrix codepre  pAnd this is how I calculate the frustum and its bounding boxp  precodeMatrix inverseProjectionViewMatrix  projectionViewMatrix.Inversed  Vertex3f points[8]  frustumVertices[0]  inverseProjectionViewMatrix  Vertex3f1.0f,  1.0f, 1.0f   near topleft frustumVertices[1]  inverseProjectionViewMatrix  Vertex3f 1.0f,  1.0f, 1.0f   near topright frustumVertices[2]  inverseProjectionViewMatrix  Vertex3f1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f   near bottomleft frustumVertices[3]  inverseProjectionViewMatrix  Vertex3f 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f   near bottomright frustumVertices[4]  inverseProjectionViewMatrix  Vertex3f1.0f,  1.0f,  1.0f   far topleft frustumVertices[5]  inverseProjectionViewMatrix  Vertex3f 1.0f,  1.0f,  1.0f   far topright frustumVertices[6]  inverseProjectionViewMatrix  Vertex3f1.0f, 1.0f,  1.0f   far bottomleft frustumVertices[7]  inverseProjectionViewMatrix  Vertex3f 1.0f, 1.0f,  1.0f   far bottomright  boundingBoxMin  frustumVertices[0] boundingBoxMax  frustumVertices[0]  for AInt i  1 i lt 8 i      boundingBoxMin.x  minboundingBoxMin.x, frustumVertices[i].x     boundingBoxMin.y  minboundingBoxMin.y, frustumVertices[i].y     boundingBoxMin.z  minboundingBoxMin.z, frustumVertices[i].z      boundingBoxMax.x  maxboundingBoxMax.x, frustumVertices[i].x     boundingBoxMax.y  maxboundingBoxMax.y, frustumVertices[i].y     boundingBoxMax.z  maxboundingBoxMax.z, frustumVertices[i].z   boundingBoxCenter  Vertex3fboundingBoxMin.x  boundingBoxMax.x  2.0f, boundingBoxMin.y  boundingBoxMax.y  2.0f, boundingBoxMin.z  boundingBoxMax.z  2.0f codepre

Negative 3995 pI have a situation where I need to compare two sets of data from Sql Server.

Negative 3995 pIm working on a cookbook app that will have three user levels subscriber, contributor, and administrators. Guests can see categories, but not individual recipes.

Contributors can create, editupdate, and delete recipes that they have contributedauthored, but only Admins can edit or delete any recipe as well as create new categories. p  pIm managed to create an admin filter that works, but since Im using resourceful routing, I am putting the filters into the resource controllers constructor in order to get it to workmerely putting it as a route above the resource route does nothing so, for instance, having Routegetrecipes.index, [before  auth, uses  RecipeControllerindex] above Routeresourcerecipes, RecipeController doesnt workp  pMy trouble is the access restriction for Contributors for only their recipes. On the User model, I defined the relationship of the user to recipes 1 to many as well as rolesp  precodeUser model     Set up One To Many relationship for users to recipes public function recipes      return this gt hasManyRecipe     Get user role   param role   return user role   public function getRolerole      return thisgtrole  role      Determine if the user is an administrator     param none   return bool admin yes or no   public function isAdmin      return thisgtgetRoleAdministrator      Determine if the user contributor is the author of a recipe based on the relationship defined above   param recipeId   return mixed   public function isRecipeAuthorrecipeId      return thisgtgetRoleContributorgtrecipesgtcontainsrecipeId  codepre  pI set up filters on filters.php with different error responses, it is easier to tell which is firingp  precodefilters.php  This is a filter for determining administrators Routefilteradmin, function     if  AuthUsergtisAdmin      return Redirecttogtwithmessage, Not authorized       This is a filter for determining recipe authors hopefully Routefilterauthor, functionrecipeId         if  AuthUsergtisRecipeAuthorrecipeId      return Appabort401, You are not authorized.      codepre  pAnd finally, on the RecipeController, I have the followingp  precodeRecipeController.php     Constructor function acts as Filter to restrict individual full recipe views from guests public function construct      thisgtbeforeFilterauth, [only gt [show, edit, update, store, destroy]]only those logged in may view recipes     thisgtbeforeFilteradminauthor, [only gt [create, edit, update, store, destroy]]  codepre  pThe problem is, this filter works if its just the admin, but throwing the author one in there, even subscribers can edit and create and presumably destroy recipes. I know I have a parameter of recipeId on the isRecipeAuthor function, but Im not quite sure how to reference that through the constructor in the first place not being very familiar with constructors, and being new to objects. I would love some advice on how to tackle this problemhere I thought I could do it with individual routes. Possibly I could rewrite all my recipe routes as individual controller methods instead of resource, but even doing that, I still am not sure how to tackle how to pass in the recipeid variable.p

Negative 3995 pI am working on a project for class and I have pretty much completed all my code I just have one issue THE CODE IS IN C. Im not too great at using boolean functions especially in the case for this program. If you guys could help me write or push me in the right direction for this code Id appreciate it. This program is supposed to be a Soda Machine program made of structs. My question is how do I pass the array to the boolean function in order to check if there are any drinks left for the one that the customer wants to purchase. If there are no drinks left, the  program will print out Sorry we are sold out. Please make another selection. If there are still drinks available then just do nothing and continue with the program. It will pretty much validate the amount of drinks left. I attempted to write the function but Im not sure if it is correct, I will post it for you guys to take a look at it.

it goes to a given stock and takes the stock data that is presented on the first page. It then sees if there is a next page link. If there is, it will pass it to codestocks2code, if there is yet another codenext pagecode, it will pass it back to codestocks1code, and will continue doing this until there are no more pages. Once there are no more pages, it will send the data to codefinalizestockcode, where it is supposed to save all of this data, as well as manipulated data that doesnt matter for the purposes of this question. p  pstrongThe Outputstrong A small samplep  precodeprint currentpage httpfinance.yahoo.comqhpsPZA.TOampa04ampb19ampc2005ampd04ampe19ampf2006ampgdampz66ampy198 print stocks 2 stocks2  print returnspages  before scraped this page [u4.75, u4.78, u4.78, u4.83, u4.87, u4.90, u4.90, u4.97, u4.99, u4.92, u4.95, u4.90, u4.90, u4.93, u4.92, u4.90, u4.89, u4.88, u4.95, u4.90, u4.95, u4.95, u4.95, u4.90, u4.90, u4.90, u4.90, u4.95, u4.91, u4.91, u4.90, u4.92, u4.92, u4.92, u4.91, u4.92, u4.91, u4.91, u4.90, u4.92, u4.95, u4.95, u4.85, u4.83, u4.91, u4.90, u4.92, u4.95, u4.95, u4.92, u4.92, u4.92, u4.87, u4.88, u4.92, u4.90, u4.94, u4.90, u4.97, u4.97, u4.94, u4.90, u4.92, u4.83, u4.83, u4.83, u4.83, u4.75, u4.75, u4.78, u4.80, u4.81, u4.81, u4.84, u4.80, u4.78, u4.83, u4.80, u4.83, u4.81, u4.87, u4.97, u5.02, u4.97, u4.91, u4.91, u4.92, u4.90, u4.90, u4.83, u4.79, u4.83, u4.83, u4.83, u4.83, u4.77, u4.78, u4.81, u4.83, u4.83, u4.85, u4.80, u4.87, u4.87, u4.87, u4.87, u4.83, u4.83, u4.83, u4.87, u4.85, u4.83, u4.83, u4.87, u4.83, u4.83, u4.85, u4.83, u4.80, u4.80, u4.78, u4.71, u4.72, u4.71, u4.73, u4.71, u4.54, u4.29, u4.25, u4.23, u4.25, u4.27, u4.25, u4.30, u4.32, u4.30, u4.30, u4.27, u4.27, u4.22, u4.13, u4.12, u4.15, u4.15, u4.22, u4.22, u4.27, u4.27, u4.27, u4.25, u4.46, u4.22, u4.39, u4.37, u4.36, u4.57, u4.63, u4.68, u4.68, u4.67, u4.73, u4.80, u4.83, u4.84, u4.84, u4.85, u4.85, u4.81, u4.78, u4.83, u5.06, u5.09, u5.02, u5.12, u5.09, u5.12, u5.14, u5.07, u5.06, u4.99, u5.00, u4.97, u4.98, u4.98, u4.95, u4.92, u4.98, u4.92, u4.93, u4.93, u4.95, u4.94, u4.92, u4.90, u4.85]  print after 2 after 2 Print returnspages  after scraped this page [u4.75, u4.78, u4.78, u4.83, u4.87, u4.90, u4.90, u4.97, u4.99, u4.92, u4.95, u4.90, u4.90, u4.93, u4.92, u4.90, u4.89, u4.88, u4.95, u4.90, u4.95, u4.95, u4.95, u4.90, u4.90, u4.90, u4.90, u4.95, u4.91, u4.91, u4.90, u4.92, u4.92, u4.92, u4.91, u4.92, u4.91, u4.91, u4.90, u4.92, u4.95, u4.95, u4.85, u4.83, u4.91, u4.90, u4.92, u4.95, u4.95, u4.92, u4.92, u4.92, u4.87, u4.88, u4.92, u4.90, u4.94, u4.90, u4.97, u4.97, u4.94, u4.90, u4.92, u4.83, u4.83, u4.83, u4.83, u4.75, u4.75, u4.78, u4.80, u4.81, u4.81, u4.84, u4.80, u4.78, u4.83, u4.80, u4.83, u4.81, u4.87, u4.97, u5.02, u4.97, u4.91, u4.91, u4.92, u4.90, u4.90, u4.83, u4.79, u4.83, u4.83, u4.83, u4.83, u4.77, u4.78, u4.81, u4.83, u4.83, u4.85, u4.80, u4.87, u4.87, u4.87, u4.87, u4.83, u4.83, u4.83, u4.87, u4.85, u4.83, u4.83, u4.87, u4.83, u4.83, u4.85, u4.83, u4.80, u4.80, u4.78, u4.71, u4.72, u4.71, u4.73, u4.71, u4.54, u4.29, u4.25, u4.23, u4.25, u4.27, u4.25, u4.30, u4.32, u4.30, u4.30, u4.27, u4.27, u4.22, u4.13, u4.12, u4.15, u4.15, u4.22, u4.22, u4.27, u4.27, u4.27, u4.25, u4.46, u4.22, u4.39, u4.37, u4.36, u4.57, u4.63, u4.68, u4.68, u4.67, u4.73, u4.80, u4.83, u4.84, u4.84, u4.85, u4.85, u4.81, u4.78, u4.83, u5.06, u5.09, u5.02, u5.12, u5.09, u5.12, u5.14, u5.07, u5.06, u4.99, u5.00, u4.97, u4.98, u4.98, u4.95, u4.92, u4.98, u4.92, u4.93, u4.93, u4.95, u4.94, u4.92, u4.90, u4.85, u4.85, u4.86, u4.92, u4.93, u4.92, u4.95, u4.93, u4.94, u4.95, u4.96, u4.95, u4.95, u4.95, u4.95, u4.98, u4.97, u4.92, u4.94, u4.90, u4.93, u4.93, u4.97, u4.97, u4.97, u4.90, u5.00, u5.02, u5.11, u5.12, u5.12] 20150525 1741460700 [dnot] DEBUG Crawled 200 ltGET httpfinance.yahoo.comlookupsPVS.PR.D.TOgt referer httpeoddata.comstocklistTSXP.htm 20150525 1741460700 [dnot] DEBUG Redirecting 301 to ltGET httpfinance.yahoo.comlookupsPUD.B.TOgt from ltGET httpfinance.yahoo.comlookupylcX3oDMTF2cTUxaTdhBGtleXcDUFVELkIuVE8EbWlkA21lZGlhcXVvdGVzc2VhcmNoBHNlYwNnZXRxdW90ZXNidG4Ec2xrA2xvb2t1cAsPUD.B.TOgt sending to finalize stock  See here, it does call the def finalizestock function codepre  pHowever, nothing gets saved to the items.

Negative 3995 pIm working on an excel project that helps visualising blood work in generating a chart for each single value. p  pAs Im trying to prevent empty values in charts I added two sheets that actually manage the data data and charts charts. In data one enters values and dates, in charts you will see the charts empty charts will not be displayed, data helps generating series and charts actually carries the charts. p  pAt the moment Im working on a VBA script that will help me duplicating a chart on charts and changing series for the duplicates I need about 100 of those. It works perfectly for the first duplicate but on the second I get a Runtime Error 1004 Applicationdefined of objectdefined error.

Negative 3995 pI am working on an app that sends messages to other phones. Kind of like a chat messenger in a way. The way my app is supposed to work is the user enters an IP address and a message and the app send the message to the specified IP address. I currently have the server and client working within the same app. This way, any phone is able to connect to any other phone because each have their independent server which is accessed via the devices IP address. However, I am not able to connect to an IP address that is not located on my LAN. strongI want to know how could I make the server receive messages from devices not connected to my LANstrongp  pI read about port forwarding and it seems like a good solution, but the security risks are not encouraging. I was also thinking about using a public IP address, such as Amazons Web Server, to run my server on and the IP address would be accessible from anywhere world wide. The only problem with this is how would the server know which device to send the message top
Negative 3995 pThe only thing I need to know is if I can create a value for an item in the ComboBox, then I think I will be able to accomplish the task at hand.

Negative 3995 pI had a little experiment with writing a custom form directive. Based on the example for custom form directive in the a hrefhttpsdocs.angularjs.orgguideforms relnofollowdeveloper guidea I tried to make a point that you have to wrap your codesetViewValuecode call with codescope.applycode and show how the model is not updating without it. But to my surprise I removed the codescope.applycode wrapping and the code still works.  So I did some digging in angular source code and found out that with changes made to support 1.3 ngModelOptions codesetViewValuecode already calls codescope.applycode and now actually wrapping it causes an strongextra unnecessary digest cyclestrong.

Negative 3995 pI have Mavenwar project in Netbeans. If I have feature Deploy on Save DOS turned on, it will do automatic deploy with keepstate turn on. This preserve sessions, so I can continue with debuggingtesting of application.  Problem with DOS is that I dont want it on every file save. Sometimes I need change couple of files and then do deploy. If DOS is turn on, it will do many deploys and with big war it takes time.p  pSo, I turn DOS off, and start using shortcut to deploy. But this manuallytriggered deploy doesnt use keepstate, so session is lost.

Negative 3995 pToday I was trying to trigger the tooltip of a particular element when I hovered over a different element. Im not that experienced in jQuery, but I eventually got this to work reading through the docs. Afterwards, I saw how I referenced the target element and it seemed really convoluted. I was wondering if there were better methods that could produce the same results.p  pThe HTML Im working with is as followsp  precodeltdiv classitemgt     lth3 classleveltitlegtITEM 1         ltspan classlevellabel datatoggletooltip dataplacementtop dataanimationtrue titleTooltip text that pops upgtTitle Text         ltspangt     lth3gt     ltdiv classlevelbargt         ltdiv classlevelbarinner datalevel70gt         ltdivgt                                           ltdivgt ltdivgt  ltdiv classitemgt     lth3 classleveltitlegtITEM 2         ltspan classlevellabel datatoggletooltip dataplacementtop dataanimationtrue titleTooltip text that pops upgtTitle Text         ltspangt     lth3gt     ltdiv classlevelbargt         ltdiv classlevelbarinner datalevel70gt         ltdivgt                                           ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pIn my HTML file I have 5 or so of those item sections. What I wanted was for the tooltip to not only trigger when a viewer moused over the Title Text, but also when they hovered over the levelbarinner div. To I achieve this I came up with the following piece of JavaScriptp  precodejQuerydocument.readyfunction  ...     .levelbarinner.hover         functione              e.target.parent.siblings[0].children[0].tooltipshow         ,         functione              e.target.parent.siblings[0].children[0].tooltiphide               ...  codepre  pIt seemed like a sloppy solution but a reasonable one. This method hinges on there being only one sibling and one child, which fortunately in my case was true for all the item sections in my HTML file. Which leads me to asking if there are bettermore efficient methods of retrieving this element or even just toggling its tooltip in general.p

However I cant manage to pass the value of the comment to the bean that deals with it. I thought about passing the UIInput value as described in the first answer [by balusC here][1].

Negative 3995 pI am trying my hands with SharedElements and Content Transitions in Android. I was trying to combine Content Transitions and Shared Elements and create a particular animation, however I have encountered a problem. After the transition on Shared Elements ImageView end, I am using content Transitions to animate Text View into position using Slide Transition. However when the textViews are sliding from Bottom to their position on the top of image View, the text goes beneath the ImageView Shared Element and later just appears on the top of the ImageView.

Negative 3995 pI would like to allow users to manage their own files on my web application using a file manager. The specific file manager does not matter, but what I need to know is how to give each user access to their own file directory within my server storage directory and only allow reading and writing within that folder.p  pIn the backend, each user already has that folder set up as I was allowing them to upload single images before, but everything was handled on the back end, and now I dont understand how to give the user the ability to actually access that directory properly in such a way that the file manager can view and edit the directory contents.p  pOnce again, the file structure already exists and the server side code performs actions within those directories, but now the question is how to expose those directories freely to the user after doing a check that it is their folder and they have the permissions to view  modify. Much appreciated.p  pFOR EXAMPLEp  pELFinder requires the following parametersp  precodefunction elFinderBrowser fieldname, url, type, win    tinymce.activeEditor.windowManager.open     file pathtofile,  use an absolute path     title elFinder 2.0,     width 900,     height 450,     resizable yes   ,      setUrl function url        win.document.getElementByIdfieldname.value  url           return false  codepre  pI cant just simply pass in to the file attribute codestoragesubdirimagescode because thats not publicly accessible. Also, if I pass in the url to the public directory, the file manager only seems to be able to view the directory web pages. It cant make changes probably because the public folder is read only.p

Negative 3995 pI have a nested ngrepeat on a table. It is an accordion table with child rows for each parent row. In order to accomplish this I created a codelttbodygtcode for each parent item, placing the parent row in a codelttrgtcode and then using codengrepeatcode to add all the child rows. Due to the multiple codelttbodygtcode elements the zebra striping on the table gets thrown off. Another wrinkle is that the table has the ability to collapseexpand child rows and I need the striping to be correct for strongwhichever rows are visiblestrong. So I am trying to manually add striping classes. Im using Angulars codenginitcode to toggle a scope variable, and then using codengclasscode to apply it. The problem is that it appears to be bound to the final state of the variable rather than what it was as the iterator was rendering the row.p  pHTMLp  precode    lttbody ngrepeatparentRow in myData nginitchangeRowClassevengt         lttr ngclassindustrypaymentsevenrowindustryRowEven,industrypaymentsoddrowindustryRowEvengt             lttdgtparentRow.industryCode  parentRow.industryCodeDescriptionlttdgt             lttd classnumericgtparentRow.ValueOneSumlttdgt             lttd classnumericgtparentRow.ValueTwoSumlttdgt         lttrgt         lttr ngrepeatchildRow in parentRow.childIndustries nginitchangeRowClasseven ngclassindustrypaymentsevenrowindustryRowEven,industrypaymentsoddrowindustryRowEvengt             lttdgtchildRow.industryCode  childRow.industryCodeDescriptionlttdgt             lttd classnumericgtchildRow.ValueOnelttdgt             lttd classnumericgtchildRow.ValueTwolttdgt         lttrgt     lttbodygt codepre  pController codep  precodescope.industryRowEven  false scope.changeRowClass  functionisEven      scope.industryRowEven  isEven  codepre  pI need each iteration of parent OR child to reverse the class for the next one emIm leaving out the issue of if the child is visible or not for now to keep this more simpleem. I can see in the debugger that the variable is getting toggled properly on each iteration. The problem is that the codengclasscode seems to be bound to the current state in scope so when it is true it would apply one class, but then next time it is false and switches the class for all of them.p  pI need it to just print the class according to the variable state at the time it renders that row, and then ignore the variable unless the ngrepeat is started over like for sorting or toggling visibility, etc.p  pIs there a way to stop the bindingp

Negative 3995 pI sometimes shuffle lists or arrays using codeOrderBy item gt R.NextDoublecode, where codeRandom Rcode is initialized elsewhere.p  pNow this clearly is a hack, though the one recommended everywhere on this site, and it does work very nicely in practice.p  pHowever, it was also pointed out that this makes the assumption that the sorting algorithm does not get confused by changing values of a single item and e.g. enters an infinite loop.p  pMy question is if there is some sort of implicit or explicit guarantee that this wont happen.

For historical reasons we collect a bunch of server info through Windows server Forwarded Event solution. Forwarded Events is not easy to collect from a collector computer as logparser and other solutions hardly access it. So I decided to collect and uplaod it with Powershell.p  pThe script runs every 60 minutes as scheduled job, collects events backward for 65 minutes.p  pThe script runs fine. But from time to time it does skips 12 lines. I do not understand why. It does not skips a whole session  but for example if in a 65 minute interval there are 5 events, it uploads 4. Next time it runns fluently. Next time it again skips from 10 event 2 randomly.p  pI would like to know why. But I do not understand the reason AND I have no clue how could I log the actual insert command to fix it, or create other error handling.p  pAs you can see I implemented transaction as well  hopefully not wrongly, and transaction gives an ok as well.p  pHave no Idea how to find the reason andor source of error.p

I installed gulp globally using the following command codenpm install global gulpcode, After that I have installed glup in my project using the following command codenpm install savedev gulpcode. However, When I try to run the command codegulpcode I receive this error codebash usrlocalbingulp No such file or directorycode.
