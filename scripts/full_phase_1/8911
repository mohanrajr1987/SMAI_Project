Positive 8911 pWe are having an aspx website that has the form fields with the submit button, the postback for the site used to happen normally, all of a sudden we are not able to perform postback in the website. And after clearing the browser cache we are able to perform the postback in the website. p  pThis seems to be strange behavior as temporarily for some of the users on button click only the form reloads and nothing happens. The application seems to behave normally after the browser cache clear, any advice on the same is highly appreciated, as the users do not accept the workaround often.p  pRegards Arvindp

Positive 8911 pIm writing an snippet to upload images through AJAX. A user selects the image in a form fileinput. The form has a onsubmitfunction which prevents default, so that the page doesnt reload after submitting.

This loadfunction consists of things like hiding a loader and echo something like finished uploading. The page where the data is transmitted through ajax has a phpscript which scales the image, copy it, rename it and so on. To it creates various copies in different sizes of the image. p  pThe Problem If I submit the form NOT through ajax, everything is fine.

Positive 8911 pI have a form with multiple added dynamic rows, and i want to do a little validation of the input before i submit the form, e.g. check if all fields have input and such.

After the first invalid row, the function will return without any result. But if all formGroups are checked, the forLoop will exit and the codeform.submitcode call will submit the form.p  pHowever, the final submit does not happen. Even if all form elements have valid input, the form does not submit. However, during some debugging i commented out the whole forloop, and the form submits, but with no validation, of course.  So i am assuming that somehow the forloop does not exit properly, and could need some help with that problem.p  pThe whole project is written in plain Javascript, however, the library i am using to dynamically add and remove items to the form bases on jQuery. p  pFor reference, you can find the project online a hrefhttpdnstest.simonszu.de relnofollowhereap

Positive 8911 pI have come across the problem that people on my website can doublesubmit a form. This isnt an issue from the database side, as the records are saved by serverside validation. However, its important I invalidate any additional requests so that users dont get double charged as the charge occurs prior to the account being made. I would prefer to drop the request entirely as opposed to redirecting because it will really ruin the UX, whereas dropping the request will just make the process appear longer which is a better compromise.p  pTo clear things up, I am also using the postredirectget pattern, but it does not solve this problem, which is actually the most critical problem because it is the most common. Implementing a clientside solution will be done for cleanliness of the UI, but I cannot trust the user to not disable javascript or somehow tamper with it.p  pI have a middleware solution using the library codecsurfcode that doesnt quite work.p  precodevar protectroute  functionreq, res, next   ifreq.session.uniquerequests     req.session.uniquerequests  []       var found  .findreq.session.uniquerequests, functiontoken     return token  req.body.csrf       iffound    req.session.uniquerequests.pushreq.body.csrf    next    else     nextroute drop the post, and skip anything else.      var unlockroute  functionreq, res, next   req.session.uniquerequests  .withoutreq.session.uniquerequests, req.body.csrf  codepre  pI attach it to my routes like sop  precoderouter.postcreate, protectroute, functionreq, res     If it makes it in here, the route is protected and the      request wasnt dropped.   router.getreview, unlockroute, functionreq, res     The form will once again be able to be submitted.  codepre  pUnfortunately, even though the middleware gets called, if I mash the create button it will fire off a ton of requests, each will attempt to push the token onto the codeuniquerequestscode, and the result is it wont block any requests for a few pushes until everything catches up.p  pWhat am I doing wrong here, and how can I fix itp  pstrongEDITstrong Ratelimiting the POST to create seems like a possibility, though it doesnt seem like a emrealem solution I suppose.

Negative 8911 pThis morning, I was reading a hrefhttpsteve.yegge.googlepages.comwhenpolymorphismfailsSteve Yegges When Polymorphism Failsa, when I came across a question that a coworker of his used to ask potential employees when they came for their interview at Amazon.p  blockquote   pAs an example of polymorphism in   action, lets look at the classic   eval interview question, which as   far as I know was brought to Amazon   by Ron Braunstein. The question is   quite a rich one, as it manages to   probe a wide variety of important   skills OOP design, recursion, binary   trees, polymorphism and runtime   typing, general coding skills, and if   you want to make it extra hard   parsing theory.p      pAt some point, the candidate hopefully   realizes that you can represent an   arithmetic expression as a binary   tree, assuming youre only using   binary operators such as , ,   , . The leaf nodes are all   numbers, and the internal nodes are   all operators. Evaluating the   expression means walking the tree. If   the candidate doesnt realize this,   you can gently lead them to it, or if   necessary, just tell them.p      pEven if you tell them, its still an   interesting problem.p      pThe first half of the question, which   some people whose names I will   protect to my dying breath, but their   initials are Willie Lewis feel is a   Job Requirement If You Want To Call   Yourself A Developer And Work At   Amazon, is actually kinda hard. The   question is how do you go from an   arithmetic expression e.g. in a   string such as 2  2 to an   expression tree. We may have an ADJ   challenge on this question at some   point.p      pThe second half is lets say this is   a 2person project, and your partner,   who well call Willie, is   responsible for transforming the   string expression into a tree. You get   the easy part you need to decide what   classes Willie is to construct the   tree with. You can do it in any   language, but make sure you pick one,   or Willie will hand you assembly   language. If hes feeling ornery, it   will be for a processor that is no   longer manufactured in production.p      pYoud be amazed at how many candidates   boff this one.p      pI wont give away the answer, but a   Standard Bad Solution involves the use   of a switch or case statment or just   good oldfashioned cascadedifs. A   Slightly Better Solution involves   using a table of function pointers,   and the Probably Best Solution   involves using polymorphism. I   encourage you to work through it   sometime. Fun stuffp blockquote  pSo, lets try to tackle the problem all three ways.  How do you go from an arithmetic expression e.g. in a string such as 2  2 to an expression tree using cascadedifs, a table of function pointers, andor polymorphism  p  pFeel free to tackle one, two, or all three.p  p[update title modified to better match what most of the answers have been.]p

Sort of like Visual Studios SHIFTDELETE feature, but working for multiple lines at once.p  pSay you want to delete line 3 from following code tabs and newlines visualized as well. The nave way would be to select the text between angle bracketsp  pre if true n t int i  1n t lti  2gtn t i  3n n pre  pThen hit backspace. This creates a blank line. Hit backspace twice more to delete t and n. p  pYou end up withp  pre if true n t int i  1n t i  3n n pre  pWhen you try to select a whole line, Visual Studio doesnt let you select the trailing newline character. For example, placing the cursor on a line and hitting SHIFTEND will not select the newline at the end. Neither will you select the newline if you use your mouse, i.e. clicking in the middle of a line and dragging the cursor all the way to the right. You only select the trailing newline characters if you make a selection that spans at least two lines. Most editors I use do it this way Microsoft WordPad and Word are counterexamples and I frequently get newlines wrong when deleting text there at least Word has a way to display endofline and endofparagraph characters explicitly.p  pWhen using Visual Studio and other editors in general, heres the solution that currently works best for mep  pUsing the mouse, I select the characters that I put between angle bracketsp  pre if true n t int i  1ltn t i  2gtn t i  3n n pre  pHitting backspace now, you delete the line in one go without having to delete any other characters. This works for several contiguous lines at once. Additionally, it can be used for transposing lines. You could drag the selection between the angle brackets to the point marked with a caretp  pre if true n t int i  1ltn t i  2gtn t i  3n n pre  pThis leaves you withp  pre if true n t int i  1n t i  3ltn t i  2gtn n pre  pwhere lines 3 and 4 have switched place.p  pThere are variations on this theme. When you want to delete line 3, you could also select the following charactersp  pre if true n t int i  1n ltt i  2n gtt i  3n n pre  pIn fact, this is what Visual Studio does if you tell it to select a complete line. You do this by clicking in the margin between your code and the column where the red circles go which indicate breakpoints. The mouse pointer is mirrored in that area to distinguish it a little better, but I think its too narrow and physically too far removed from the code I want to select.p  pMaybe this method is useful to other people as well, even if it only serves to make them aware of how newlines are handled when selectingdeleting text It works nicely for most nonspecialized text editors. However, given the vast amount of features and plugins for Visual Studio which I use most, Im sure there is better way to use it to delete and move lines of code. Getting the indentation right automatically when moving code between different blocks would be nice i.e. without hitting Format DocumentSelection. Im looking forward to suggestions no rants on microoptimization, pleasep  phr p  pstrongemSummary of Answersemstrongp  pWith respect to Visual Studio Navigating well with the cursor keys.p  pThe solution that would best suit my style of going over and editing code is the emEclipseem wayp  pYou can select several consecutive lines of code, where the first and the last selected line may be selected only partially. Pressing ALTup,down moves the complete lines not just the selection up and down, fixing indentation as you go. Hitting CTRLD deletes the lines completely not just the selection without leaving any unwanted blank lines. I would love to see this in Visual Studiop

Negative 8911 pI am running a Django through modpython on Apache on a linux box. I have a custom authentication backend, and middleware that requires authentication for all pages, except static content.p  pMy problem is that after I log in, I will still randomly get the log in screen now and again. It seems to me that each apache process has its own python process, which in turn has its own internals. So as long as I get served by the same process I logged in to, everything is fine and dandy. But if my request gets served by a different apache process, I am no longer authenticated.p  pI have checked the HTTP headers I send with FireBug, and they are the same each time, ie. same cookie.p  pIs this a known issue and are there workaroundsfixesp  pEdit I have a page that displays a lot of generated images. Some off these will not display. This is because they are too behind the authenticating middleware, so they will randomly put up a login image. However, refreshing this page enough times, and it will eventually work, meaning all processes recognize my session.p

Negative 8911 pIm hitting a weird issue with a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMSBuild relnofollowMSBuilda, and Im thinking it might just be an environment issue.

Negative 8911 pI need to read a single file using multiple threads under Linux. There are reading operations only and no need of writing. The file reading dont need read the whole file every time.  It need read one or more portions of a file every time.  I store the offset of each portion beforehand. The file is too large to put into main memory.p  pSo for example, many users want to read such file. I use a thread or a process to read the file to answer user requests. What will happen under Linux Will all the read operations be queued And the OS will complete the file reading one by one Is it possible to improve the performance of such operationsp  pIm trying to implement a simple inverted index used in information retrieval.  I put dictionary in memory and posting lists in files.  Each file contains a segment of the index.  In the dictionary, I can store something like offset to point to the position of the words posting list.  When 100 users want to search something in one second, they submit different queries.  So each reading will read different part of the file.p

Negative 8911 pIm trying to createa timetracking application in WPF. The user is supposed to draw elements that represent a timespan timespan  bar onto a Canvas. Now, exisiting bars are added when they are databound to a collection each collection item contains the width and left position of the bar on the Canvas.p  pThe bar Usercontrol has a dependency property called ProjectProperty which takes care of drawing and positioning the bar on the Canvas.p  pBut what needs to happen when the user draws a new bar on the Canvas It has to somehow be databound, but at what point in time does this need to happen, and how would I do thatp  pI understand that each of the bar UserControls on the Canvas is databound, simply because they already exist in the datasource.p  pSay the user starts drawing the bar on mousedown and finishes on mouseup, do I have to programtically add its left position and width to the bound datasource If not, how else would the datasource be updatedp  pThanksp

Negative 8911 pThis question was originally about getting twoway binding to work at all, but due to lack of specific answers and otherwise progress along the way, Ive been updating it  You can check the edit history, but I figured this is better for clarity.p  pThe code listing below allows a single object to be twoway databound to a templated control.  Id like to extend this example in the simplest way possible to allow for nesting of similarly twoway databindingenabled templated controls for complextyped properties of the rootmost object.  For example, codeSampleFormDatacode has a property codeListltstringgt Itemscode.  Id like to be able to bind to this list within the rootmost template from this code listing, and either display the string data in an editable list of textboxes, perhaps, with commands for insert, delete, rebindenteredchanges back to the bound objects List property.  Also, if this were a list of a complex type codeSampleFormChildDatacode, rather than string, a new embedded codeSampleSpecificEntryFormcode could be used within the list, bound to each of the lists items, like a repeater.  And so on down to the leafsimple properties, if the author so chooses.  The uifields need not be autogenerated, just available for binding.  p  pNote The case of the codeListltstringgtcode is special because even the builtin bindings cant handle string as the DataItem directly  binding to strings directly as items in our list is not a requirement, but certainly valuable.p  pThis is different from a codeFormViewcode because it is not built to expect to bind to one of a list of items, only to a single item as persisted in viewstate or where ever.  Unlike the FormView, this only has a single default template akin to FormViews EditTemplate.  Likewise, binding to a collectionlike property would also only have one view  edit.  There is no selection of the row and then editing.  Everything is editable all the time.  The purpose is to make twoway bound forms easier to build.p  pSeems to me that there ought to be two kinds of binding.  codeSingleEntityBindingcode and codeCollectionBindingcode.  codeSingleEntityBindingcode takes a single object instance as a datasource as prototyped by codeSampleSpecificEntryFormcode while codeCollectionBindingcode could be bound to its parent codeSingleEntityBindingcode with attributes of codeDataSourceIDEntryForm1 DataMemberItemscode as in the code example for codeDataList1code below.  Nesting of either type should be supported in either type.  List manipulation such as insertchangedelete type operations against the backingobjects data are the responsibility of the form author however, such mechanics would be relatively simple to implement.p

I do not see any errors being returned from the syscall. I tried tracing the system calls, and did not observe anything weird even while the file is NOT being updated.p  pSince each process gets its own file table entry which has the current offset, all I was expecting was an output file with data interspersed with writes from the two noncooperating processespossibly garbled too.

So I guess I have mistakenly introduced something that IE doesnt like who knows, maybe I got crazy and used Array.map instead of dojo.map somewhere and it blows up in my face, producing nice error messages that dont help me at all [object object] and  is null where it shouldnt be, so I assume there was an error upstream that failed silently and prevented this object from being created.p  pIve tried having a look at the Google Closure Linter but it doesnt yield anything special, and I dont think that the Google Closure Compiler is going to be my savior either. is there any tool commandline, webservice or other that can parserun code as if it were emulating IE so we can get the appropriate errorsp  pAny tips are appreciated.p  pEDIT Thank you for your help in trying to solve my issue so far, but what I am really just asking is if there are tools that do this sort of checks, meaning validating a feature set and syntax against a particular browser. This is the sort of thing severly lacking in the JSworld in my opinion not so much for FF or Chrome, obviously as their debuggers are a bit more helpful.p  pEDIT2 I eventually found the root of my problem today after 3 days by going through all my code changes between two branches and realizing that the problem was actually already there but never detected before and going back through even older changes to narrow down the mess and eventually end up adding console logs everywhere until I reached a point of failure God thank emacs for its regular expression support to add logs to every single line... heavy but works.... Fun fact though IE swallowed an error message supposed to be displayed in the try catch block originally catching the source problem and then rethrowing it. Still dont why, but if it hadnt then that would have been a lot easier to find, as it was intended for that purpose in case it broke. Weird. Might not like deeplevels of rethrow.p  pIll leave the question open as for now there are no answer to the actual question.p
Negative 8911 pIm dealing with having to store some payment card data.

Negative 8911 pThis is a simplified scenario to cut to the chase I have one webpage with a table of data in grams. You can click on the table header to sort columns by their data, or click on rows to highlight them. Theres also a graph on the page, and a script on the page pulls data out of the table and uses it as data for the graph this includes rows that are highlighted, which highlights lines in the graph at the same time.p  pNow, Ive taken values in the table that are over 1000 grams, divided by 1000 and show them as kilograms, so one column in the table has a mixture of grams and kilograms to help reading the data. However, this messes with the logic in strongallstrong of the above.p  pDo you think I should hide the machinefriendly MF data in hidden columns to sort by, and display humanfriendly HF columns Should I include the MF data in each table cell, hidden with span tags Or is it worth it to completely decouple MF data on the site It seems like any of these solutions will involve a ton of rewriting data retrieval, sorting, andor graphing code. Whats the most encapsulated approachp

Negative 8911 pIve recently discovered that my app malfunctions on Win 7 machines because it does not have permission to create filessub directories in its install directory.

Negative 8911 h2Problemh2  pAt my workplace, were trying to find the best way to create automatedtests for an almost wholly javascriptdriven intranet application. Right now were stuck trying to find a good tradeoff betweenp  ul liApplication code in reusable and nestable GUI components.li liTests which are easily created by the testing teamli liTests which can be recorded once and then automatedli liTests which do not break after small cosmetic changes to the siteli ul  pXPath expressions or other possible expressions, like jQuery selectors naively generated from SeleniumIDE are often nonrepeatable and very fragile. Conversely, having the JS code generate special unique ID values for every important DOMelement on the page... well, that is its own headache, complicated by reusable GUI components and IDs needing to be consistent when the test is rerun.p  pWhat successes have other people had with this kind of thing How do you do automated applicationlevel testing of a rich JS interfacep  h2Limitationsh2  ul liWe are using JavascriptMVC 2.0, hopefully 3.0 soon so that we can upgrade to jQuery 1.4.x.li liThe testmaking folks are mostly trained to use Selenium IDE to directly record things.li liThe test leads would prefer a pageunique HTML ID on each clickable element on the page...li liTraining the testers to write or alter special expressions such as telling them which HTML classnames are important branching points is a nogo.li liWe try to make reusable javascript components, but this means very few GUI components can treat themselves or what they contain as unique.li liSome of our components already use HTML ID values in their operation. Id like to avoid doing this emanywayem, but it complicates the idea of IDbased testing.li liIt may be possible to add custom facilities like a locatorbuilder or new locator method to the SeleniumIDE installation testers use.li liAlmost everything that goes on occurs within a single page load from a conventional browser perspective, even when items are saved li ul  h2Current thoughtsh2  pIm considering a system where a custom locatorbuilder javascript code for SeleniumIDE will talk with our application code as the tester is recording. In this way, our application becomes partially responsible for generating a mostlyflexible expression XPath or jQuery for any given DOM element. While this can avoid requiring more training for testers, I worry it may be overthinking things.p

Whats the best way we can replicate The database will be updated locally. p  pAdditionally, there is a field in the online xyz table called visits. We wouldnt want to overwrite this particular field in the online table.p  pNow the records can be huge in number. My boss suggested we write a php script that copies records to the online database and flags the records that are copied. This way we do not copy twice. I know this might not be the best idea. What if a records is deleted in the online databasep  pThanking You Imranp

Negative 8911 pWe are thinking of changing our source version control system from Subversion to Git. Were pushing the limits on our current setup and think well be better of working with git. p  pWeve always used a primary server in the office, and a mirror running at our datacenter. The mirror is configured to proxy incoming commits to the primary server. This way the two machines operated as if it was a single repository, enabling us to commit to the office machine when we are in the office or to the datacenter machine when we are somewhere else.p  pHaving two machines is saving us alot of bandwidth and increases speed, which for us is important because we use subversion as our primary deployment tool too.p  pRecently we acquired a development shop in India and they will be working on the same code. Because of bandwidth limits and latency issues, having a mirror in India would be very convenient too.p  pAs we are switching to Git, we are looking for a similar setup.

Negative 8911 ol liDid IBM recently acquire or colabel FourJs Genero RDBMS li liHas anyone evaluated or developed apps with Genero under Windowsli liAnyone know if IBM has made any modifications to Generoli liDoes IBM Informix Genero provide a 4GL code generatorli ol  pI have been developing applications with Informix since 1983 Informix 3.3 on ALTOS XENIXbased systems. Most of my users are small businesses which only require singleuser capabilities. So when MSDOS versions of Informix i.e. from 2.10.06E 1985 to 4.10.DD6 1991 where available, I deployed my apps on these DOS versions of Informix. p  pWhen Microsoft Windows started gaining more popularity circa 1990, Windows 3.1, my DOSbased ISQL apps wouldnt properly function unless the Windowsbased systems where restarted in DOS mode. My apps worked fine until DOS 6.22 Windows98. p  pI then tried to persuade my DOSbased users to upgrade to UNIXbased systems in order to work with supported versions of ISQL, but only a few opted to migrate. At this point, I realized that RDS had not given any priority for a migration path of ISQL or I4GL under Windows. RDS made a mediocre attempt with NewEra but that product was flawed and failed. p  pSo, for my stubborn DOSbased users, who wanted my app to work under Windows, I provided DOS 6.22 under a virtual machine Microsoft Virtual PC 2007 which has Windows shared folder capability example DOS Drive W  a Windows Vista Desktop Folderand Windows device support examples DOS drive F  Windows Drive F USB Flash Drive, DOS LPT1 rerouted to a Windows USB Dot Matrix Printer.p  pYou may ask yourself why I have stuck with ISQL and not moved up to I4GL. The main reason is because my app is not that complicated, development and modification speed with ISQL is so much faster than I4GL, Perform screens allow multiple tables on same screen , Ace reports are very fast to code, etc.p  pWhen RDS stopped providing Informix for Windows, I began to look for alternatives like FourGen, 4Js, Querix, etc. but none of them matched the development and modification speed of my ole ISQL versions. I wish IBM could provide an ISQL version which works under native Windows, Im resistant to coding in 4GL when most mundane things are automatically handled by ISQLs Perform, Ace and SQL procs.p

Negative 8911 pI have been trying to determine which combination of packages to use for a push messaging service behind a web site... My current idea is to go with Tornado  Socket.IO Tornadio and ZMQ. But I was also looking at involving Mongrel2. Then there is also a similar project called Brubeck, that takes from Tornado, using ZMQ and Eventlet.  My main question is this... Im trying to understand where the benefit of Mongrel2 would come into play if I were to use Tornado. At that point, is Tornado even necessary I figured at that point I would just be writing a Mongrel2 python handler and thats it. I would like to focus on using websocketsjssockets which is why using Socket.IO was interesting since it handles all the backwards compatibility under the hood for you.p  pIf the tools in the mix for consideration are Python focus, Tornado, Mongrel2, ZMQ, Brubeck, and Socket.IO, what recommendations would you have for the best mix to support websockets Having Mongrel2 was really appealing for the idea of scalability, and just turning on more python handlers.p  h1Update 112012h1  pAt first went with Tornado  TornadIO  ZeroMQ, and had a working server.

Negative 8911 pIve got a UIDatePicker in Time mode with an interval of 15 minutes.p  pLets say its 722PM. The value that the date picker shows per default is the current time rounded to the next higherlower value, in this case, its 715PM.

However if there hasnt been any user interaction and I get the time with code[UIDatePicker date]code the return value is the exact current time, i.e. 722 to stick with the example. Is there any way to always get the value thats actually shown on the date picker instead of the current unrounded time, even if the user hasnt explicitly picked a value Ive already tried to set the picker manually with code[UIDatePicker setDate[NSDate date]]code but that doesnt change the behavior.p  pAny hints Thanks in advancep

Negative 8911 pIm struggling with an odd performance problem related to closing database connections in my C code. We are using a database server called Raima on a local computer only local TCP connection 127.0.0.1 to the local database server on the same computer, not across a LAN via its native Raima API not ADO.NET, just a .NET wrapper.p  pThe problem is that on many computers highperformance dualcore or quadcore computers the closing takes about 120ms250ms most of the time e.g. 120ms in a .NET C web service and 250ms in a .NET C Windows application while on the other computers it takes only 4ms steady. What confuses me is that on some computers its, for example, 120ms most of the time, but occasionally it may jump to 4ms. p  pOur database vendor Raima has told us that they cant do anything about it because these slowdowns are caused by the Winsock method closesocket.p  pSo my question is that is it true that Winsock closesocket may cause these kinds of slowdowns on a local computer Or is it, after all, just about the database vendor and their slow database driverserver p  pThanksp

Negative 8911 pI want to make MSBuild targets to make setup file and to deploy it. Right now Im using build configurations for that. So I have Debug, Release, Make setup and Deploy setup configurations. And when I want to make setup I have to switch to Make setup configuration and run build. And if I forget to switch back to Debug and run build Ill have to wait again while it is making a setup file. It doesnt seem like natural way to do this things to me. Besides, to edit my build file I have to unload project.p  pIve seen much more comfortable way to do this with Ant in Eclipsep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKbLbi.png altenter image description herep  pYou just double click target you want and itll build it. Also you can edit build file without closing anything. p  pSo the question is how to make antstyle builds with visual studio Is there a plugin or something I mean both MSBuild and Ant scripts will do, but I want this functionality integrated in VS and work with C projects.p
Negative 8911 pIs there any builtin way to get the long, expanded URL from a twitter RSS feed Right now the feed lists all the urls as codehttpt.co...code. Id like to do what the Twitter display does and display the long URLs Id also like to avoid having to do either an API call or HTTP request for each URL in the feed. Ideally, Id also like to avoid using the Twitter API directly but if thats the only way, so be it.p  h1Clarificationh1  pIm not interested in doing a separate request for every single t.co link, or calling the Twitter API. I was hoping there was a strongemsingleemstrong request I could make that would include the long URLs in the metadata or even provide the tweet in full expanded form as it appears on Twitter. Turns out the way to do this is by requesting the JSON version from search.twitter.com rather than the RSS feed, and tacking on codeincludeentitiesTruecode.p  h1Rewrite, hopefully this makes it more clearh1  pIm using a hrefhttpsearch.twitter.comsearch.rss relnofollowhttpsearch.twitter.comsearch.rssa to get a feed of tweets matching a search term. The feed contains only the shortened t.co urls. Is there a way to modify my request so that the tweets contain the expanded URLs instead p  pThe goal is to do strongjust emoneem requeststrong rather than having to go through the tweets and parse each t.co url separately especially since for a feed with several dozen t.co urls, that means several dozen separate requests. If necessary, I am willing to use the Twitter API directly to do the search instead of using RSS, but for my purposes using a feed is more ideal.p

Negative 8911 pI want to search wsus or a local folder for the updates instead of microsoft. Any ideas Here is what I have but this only connects to Windows Updates using the internet.p  h2UPDATEh2  p I FOUND OUT THE ANSWER WITH THE VBS script. The ssdefault server is set by group policy. So if I apply group policy to the WUA then I was able to make automatic updates based on WSUS. For the group policy steps go to httptechnet.microsoft.comenuslibrarycc512630.aspx  Make sure that specify intranet service location is pointing to your wsus server. In our case it was  httpwsus for both the statistics and update service.You also have to enable automatic updates like the article describes.   p  pIf you are going to use the c code below make sure to change UpdateSearchResult.Online  false if ypu want to search WSUS instead of Online.Thanks for anybody that might have tried to answer this question. p  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Text using WUApiLibthis is required to use the Interfaces given by microsoft.   todo check isassigned and guids for the following and include them in the search. httpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryff357803VS.85.aspx determine the size of the  update in mb  namespace MSHWindowsUpdateAgent      class Program              static void Mainstring[] args                       Console.WriteLineAnalyzing your needs             UpdatesAvailable             if NeedsUpdate                              EnableUpdateServicesenables everything windows need in order to make an update                 InstallUpdatesDownloadUpdates                          else                              Console.WriteLineThere are no updates for your computer at this time.

The codeLog.eNap time,   napTimecode line always shows the correct number that was selected for the napTime, so I know that the method is executing.p  precodeprivate void setNapint napTime          AlarmManager am  AlarmManager getSystemServiceContext.ALARMSERVICE                Intent i  new IntentgetApplicationContext, NapAlarm.class       i.addFlagsIntent.FLAGACTIVITYNEWTASK         PendingIntent pi  PendingIntent.getActivitygetApplicationContext, 0, i, 0              am.setAlarmManager.RTCWAKEUP, System.currentTimeMillis, pi          Log.eNap time,   napTime          TextView nap  TextView findViewByIdR.id.nap         nap.setTextnap set      codepre  pAnd the code for the activity that is launchedp  precodeimport android.app.Activity import android.media.MediaPlayer import android.os.Bundle import android.util.Log import android.view.View import android.view.WindowManager import android.view.View.OnClickListener import android.widget.Button  public class NapAlarm extends Activity implements OnClickListener       MediaPlayer mp      Override     public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.alarmlayout         getWindow.addFlagsWindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGSHOWWHENLOCKED          Button dButton  Button findViewByIdR.id.dismissButton         dButton.setOnClickListenerthis          Button sButton  Button findViewByIdR.id.snoozeButton         sButton.setOnClickListenerthis          new Threadnew Runnable               public void run                  try                       Log.eGot this far, In the alarm                      mp  MediaPlayer.creategetApplicationContext, R.raw.alarm                     mp.start                     mp.setLoopingtrue                   catch Exception e                                        .start           Override     public void onClickView v           switch v.getId           case R.id.dismissButton             mp.stop             this.finish             break          case R.id.snoozeButton             Button sButton  Button findViewByIdR.id.snoozeButton             sButton.setTextIm sorry, this app currently does not support snoozing, you must wake up.             break                codepre  pIf I run the second piece of code by itself, it works and the sound plays, etc. But if I run it from within the larger project from which the codeAlarmManangercode is supposed to create an alarm to trigger it, it never happens.p  pIs there something that I am overlooking p

Negative 8911 pWhat are the reasons for resolving overloaded operators statically It seems a strange choice to me  the only advantage I can think of is a small performance gain but then the JIT may avoid that sometimes as well at the cost of some rather unintuitive behavior  i.e. I basically have to forward the operator to a virtual function to get the wanted behavior.p  pWas this just taken over from C or are there some other good reasons for this p
Negative 8911 pI have a this application is locked dialog box on our application, which shows up after n minutes of inactivity and users have to enter a password, or change user, to get back in.p  pThe application consists of 1 or more mdi Parents, with tabbed child forms on each parent. Basically there is a main mdi for the application and each account screen that is opened from the main Form opens in a separate mdi parent. The locked dialog is shown on the main mdi form. p  pThe problem is that when a user returns to use the app, they may be using a nonmain mdi form, and the dialog box isnt visible. Even if they did not leave the app on a child form, they may click on one from the task bar. This confuses the user as the app appears to be hung, but it is jus that the dialog is bound to a form other than the one they are using.p  pAny suggestions for how to make this a little more user friendlyp  pThanksp

Negative 8911 pI am using PHP to launch an FFMPEG transcoding command. Its a typical LAMP setup running on Ubuntu 10.04 Server, theres nothing special about the configuration.p  pThe issue I am having is when I run the PHP Exec command it returns the incorrect process ID. Instead of returning the proper PID, it instead returns one that is 2 higher. i.e. the FFMPEG process id would be 3557 but PHP Exec returns 3559.p  pI have consistently managed to produce this everytime. The problem is, I really need the correct process ID so I can stop the process later if I choose to.p  pThe FFMPEG command works and starts without a problem, so I do not think it is the source of the issuep  precodecmd  ffmpeg r 4 f mjpeg an i http . internalhost .  . streamport .  vcodec libx264 vpre fastfirstpass vpre baseline b 24k bt 32k threads 0  httplocalhost8090 . localport . .ffm ffmpg  new Processcmd codepre  pI know... its pretty ugly, but it works and I dont think the variables are important.p  pTo launch the code I am using a class from the PHP Manual website which is as followsp  precodeclass Process  private pid private command  public function constructclfalse     if cl  false         thisgtcommand  cl         thisgtrunCom       private function runCom     command  nohup .thisgtcommand. gt devnull 2gt devnull amp echo      execcommand ,op     thisgtpid  intop[0]   public function setPidpid     thisgtpid  pid   public function getPid     return thisgtpid   public function status     command  ps p .thisgtpid     execcommand,op     if issetop[1]return false     else return true   public function start     if thisgtcommand  thisgtrunCom     else return true  public function stop     command  kill .thisgtpid     execcommand     if thisgtstatus  falsereturn true     else return false   codepre  pWhat I guess is happening is that for some reason FFMPEG is kicking off another 2 processes and instead of returning the PID for the main process, it is returning the PIDs for the last process.p  pCould be wrong though, but am still scratching my head.p

If there are faster SVM implementations as well, please let me know, and I may try those.p  pAddendum I went back and tried running the 32bit version again. Its much faster for some reason. It took about 3 hours to get to where the 64bit version got to in 16 hours. Why would there be such a differencep

Negative 8911 pI currently have an array that hold information that a user can do. I currently use one instance of this in a dropdown menu which is very nice. What I want to do now is only include particular items if they have access to it. So say if useraccess2 then they can do Downloadsmallimage but not Downloadlargeimage. I would like to be able to assign what the default access for each item in the array...even the key. So I can say a user access is 0 so they shouldnt display Download at all.p  pI thought maybe putting the access integers for each in an object. So accessdownloadsmallimage  2 and then I could check one by one if an access level is greater than or equal to it and add it to the array Im actually not sure how I would do the loop and build up the array correctly.

Negative 8911 pHere is the situation. Im creating an Android that utilises Bluetooth to update connected clients of each others status. The idea is for the host of the Bluetooth connection to hold a multidimensional array holding all of these stats. Each time a client updates the host of their new status, the host then update the data in the array and then sends this to all the clients.p  pOf course, this all sounds like milk and cookies to me, but unfortunately it is not. I understand that I need to have a Bluetooth socket on each end and one of them needs to be a host socket. So, get one connection done seems pretty straight forward. But what if I then want to accept more connections Ive been reading around and apparently I have to create a new thread for each connection. I dont see how that would work, could someone please explain thisp

Negative 8911 pI have a JTable called Cart where user can add products before buying them.

Negative 8911 pIm working on a very small game engine that uses OpenGL ES 2.0.  Im having a bit of a design issue with integrating VBOs into my Mesh Class.p  pThe problem is that I dont want to instantiate a new VBO for each mesh, and I want the VBO size to be determined by the number of meshes I load into it not just a fixed size of 2MB or something.p  pSince theres no realloc function for VBOs, I need to batch load all my vertex data at once.  This is ok, since I only have 4 or 5 small meshes.  So I created a MeshList class.p  pI call MeshList.AddMeshMesh mesh and it aggregates the vertexindex data of the mesh object and returns the offsets into the array of vertex dataindex data back to the mesh that was added.  This way the mesh knows where it is in the VBO but not which VBO its in.p  pHowever, none of the MeshList data is uploaded into a VBO until I call MeshList.BindToVBO.  But now, none of my meshes know which VBO theyre in.  So I was thinking of creating an array of pointers in MeshList that point to integer member variables in each Mesh class that would hold the VBO Handle.  This way, when BindToVBO is called, it iterates over the pointer array and updates the VBO Handles in the mesh objects.p  pI figured, this way it gives me the flexibility of having different mesh objects in different VBOs or all in one VBO.  The only concern I have is whether or not this is a good design.p  pIts not clear to someone glancing at the code that MeshList.BindToVBO is updating a whole bunch of mesh objects.  I mean, MeshList does interact with all of the Mesh objects prior to the BindToVBO call, but theres nothing explicitly saying that by passing a Mesh object to MeshList.AddMesh, its essentially subscribing its VBOHandle members to updates at some point in the future.p  pIve tried to make this as clear as I can.  Let me know if something needs clarification.p

Spring has an org.springframework.orm.jpa.support.OpenEntityManagerInViewInterceptor that seems to handle this situation AFAIK but I can be wrong. p  pThe Exception is thrown when executing any method accessing the listp  precodeIA entityA  business.getListOfAs In AListBean codepre  pAnd then, on the form I dop  precodeentityA.getListofB LazyInitializationException codepre  pI dont access the list as soon as I fetch the A record, there is some navigation in the middle which causes the session to be closed before I fetch the list of B items.p  pReattaching the detached instance of A solves the problem, but I dont know how can I do it without merging the object persisting any changes made to it and setting the fetch type to emeagerem is not an option.p  pIs thre any way to access the lists of B, C and D entities in A in a lazy approachp
Negative 8911 pIm working on project for old PDAs that run on the .NET 2.0 CF compact framework. Right now we are using .NET 2.0 ASMX web services, but I find that severely limiting. It is missing all sorts of things like extension methods, funcs, actions, LINQ, generic datastructures like HashSetof T, etc., that would be useful for emgetting stuff doneem.p  pEventually were probably going to get rid of the PDAs and replace them with some other technology. For that reason Id like to, as best as I can, write a reusableRESTfulish backend thus WCF.p  pIve looked online, but havent had much luck finding information. At the very least Im hoping to upgrade the backend to .NET 3.5 for improved functionality. Is it possiblep
Negative 8911 pUsing HTML5 chunking, I could do file upload with smaller piece. But the problem starts when it started using multiple http POST request which will cause the computer slowing down, or probably crash. Is there anyway to have the splitted file under one http request.. so if I have 5 files it would be only 5 http request eventhough I use html5 split chunkp  pe.g if I upload 5 files, each file will be split to 1mb chunk, so if first file is 10mb, then it will become 10 pieces of 1mb chunk. And the problem is, each chunk will be under 1 http request so just the first file it will be 10 HTTP request. Imagine if I have 1gb files, it will become 1000 HTTP request and slow down the computer. p  pThis is example code p  precode        Prepare element progress after the page load completely         var uploaders  []         var totalChunks  0         var progress         var bars         document.readyfunction              progress  document.querySelectorprogress             bars  document.querySelectorbars                            function for after the button is clicked, slice the file          and call upload function         function sendRequest                     clean the screen             bars.innerHTML                 var file  document.getElementByIdfileToUpload                 forvar i  0 i lt file.files.length i                        var blob  file.files[i]                          var originalFileName  blob.name                 var filePart  0                  const BYTESPERCHUNK  10  1024  1024  10MB chunk sizes.                 const SIZE  blob.size                  var start  0                 var end  BYTESPERCHUNK                  totalChunks  Math.ceilSIZE  BYTESPERCHUNK                  while start lt SIZE                                           if blob.webkitSlice                          for Google Chrome                         var chunk  blob.webkitSlicestart, end                       else if blob.mozSlice                          for Mozilla Firefox                         var chunk  blob.mozSlicestart, end                                                  uploadFilechunk, originalFileName, filePart, totalChunks, i                     filePart                     start  end                     end  start  BYTESPERCHUNK                                                                 function uploadFileblobFile, fileName              var fd  new FormData             fd.appendfileToUpload, blobFile              var xm  .ajax                 url upload.phpfile1fileName,                 type POST,                 data fd,                 processData false,                 contentType false,                                               function uploadFileblobFile, fileName, filePart, totalChunks, divBarsSelector              iffilePart  0                  bars  document.querySelectorbars  divBarsSelector                             var progress  document.createElementprogress             progress.min  0             progress.max  100             progress.value  0             bars.appendChildprogress                 var fd  new FormData             fd.appendfileToUpload, blobFile              var xhr  new XMLHttpRequest                             xhr.openPOST, upload.phpfilefileName  filePart, true              xhr.onload  functione                  make sure if finish progress bar at 100                 progress.value  100                  counter if everything is done using stack                 uploaders.pop                  if uploaders.length                      bars.appendChilddocument.createElementbr                     bars.appendChilddocument.createTextNodeDONE                      mergeFilefileName, totalChunks                                                               Listen to the upload progress for each upload.                xhr.upload.onprogress  functione                  if e.lengthComputable                      progress.value  e.loaded  e.total  100                                                             uploaders.pushxhr             xhr.sendfd          codepre  pand the server part for receiving will be upload.php p  precodetargetpath  uploads tmpname  FILES[fileToUpload][tmpname] size  FILES[fileToUpload][size] name  FILES[fileToUpload][name]  originalName  GET[file]  printrn printroriginalName printrn printrFILES printrn printrn targetfile  targetpath . basenamename  Result File complete  originalName com  fopenuploads.complete, ab errorlogtargetpath  if  com        Read binary input stream and append it to temp file     in  fopentmpname, rb     if  in           while  buff  fread in, 1048576                fwritecom, buff                      fclosein     fclosecom  codepre

Negative 8911 pI have an iPhone 4S and an iPhone 3GS here for research purposes. In the following weeks I want to perform some security tests especially based on the hardware encryption and Apples Data Protection API. This also includes to find some potential attack scenarios. So I guess I have to jailbreak one of the devices for it.p  pSo the question is Are there any differences in case of hardwareencryption, security mechanism, data protection and so on on the iPhone 4S compared to the iPhone 3GS. Because I would prefer to jailbreak the 3GS but it must also be representive for the newest generation of devices the iPhone 4S.p  pI am not sure if stack overflow is the right place to ask this but I think it is a question regarding the hardware specific implementation of the security mechanism and the security software in the OS.

Negative 8911 pI have a case where I need a method to rotate a model matrix in OpenGL to absolute value. Most of the rotate methods out there add rotation to a current one multiplying the current matrix with the new rotation.

Then calculate its scale from scratch based on scale variables I set before. Then multiply it with rotation matrix acquired from quaternion and eventually again translating it.p  pIt looks to me as too many calculations for such a task.

Negative 8911 pI have two projects, codeAcode and codeBcode, that reference a library, codeMyExternalLibrarycode.  codeAcode and codeBcode are code.swfcodes two different AS3 projects and codeMyExternalLibrarycode is a code.swccode.  When my application is run, codeAcode loads codeBcode.p  pThere is a codeClasscode, codeMyLoadercode, in codeMyExternalLibrarycode that codeBcode uses extensively.  codeMyExternalLibrary.MyLoadercode loads code.swfcodes that are present on our server we dont embed them because they are loaded dynamically per userrequest.  p  pNote that our server contains codeAcode, codeBcode and all of the code.swfcodes we are going to download.p  pNow, codeAcode must also load some of the code.swfcodes on our server.  Consequentially, codeAcode must also use codeMyLoadercode in codeMyExternalLibrarycode.  So, In codeAcode, I add a reference to codeMyLoadercode, so that its binary is included during compilation.  I only add a reference to codeMyLoadercode  I dont actually instantiate or modify it.  That is, somewhere in codeAcodes code before codeBcode is loaded, I havep  pcodeMyLoadercodep  pI obviously import the codeClasscode as well. This ensures that codeMyLoadercodes binary will be included in codeAcodes code.swfcode.p  pJust referencing codeMyExternalLibary.MyLoadercode in codeAcode breaks codeBcodes functionality with codeMyLoadercode  all of the code.swfcodes that codeBcode loads will not codecastcode to its associated codeClasscode, despite being a codeMovieClipcode and having all of the proper fields.  Furthermore, in the debugger, the loaded codeMovieClipcodes show that they are of the correct codeClasscode.  For example, if I load a code.swfcode, it will be a codeMovieClipcode moreover, the debugger states it is of type codeB.mySwfs.MyClasscode, but I cannot codecastcode it to codeB.mySwfs.MyClasscode.  I believe the culprit is codeApplicationDomaincode.p  pNote that commenting out that line of code makes everything in codeBcode codecastcode properly.p  pIf anyone has any idea about whats going on, Id love some advice. I think that this issue deals with codeApplicationDomaincode since codeAcode emownsem codeMyExternalLibrary.MyLoadercode, and Im trying to codecastcode a codeMovieClipcode loaded by codeAcode into a codeClasscode that is in codeBcode.  When I comment out all references to codeMyExternalLibrary.MyLoadercode in codeAcode, codeBcode now emownsem codeMyExternalLibrary.MyLoadercode, so it is able to cast to classes in codeBcode.  That is my hunchp  pThanks,p

Negative 8911 pI am using Wix 3.5 to build a MSI installer that installs two Web Applications in IIS 7. The user can choose for each application whether to install it under Default Web Site or any other existing WebSite in IIS. The installer works correctly during INSTALL by creating the two Web Applications in IIS. The problem is that after uninstalling the product, one application is removed but the other is left behind in the IIS Manager, so it has to be deleted by hand. All files related to the WebApp are removed and the components too, but the IIS WebApp is left behind. The installer is compiled both for x86 and x64 target architectures. I am testing the installer in a Windows Server 2008 R2.p  pNotesp  ul liThe problem only happens in x64 Windows Server 2008 R2. In x86 both applications are correcly removed from IIS. li liThe problem only happens    when both application are installed under the same WebSiteone is removed and the other is left behind.li liIve tried installing 3 Web Applications and i discovered that two are removed, and a third is left behind. The reamining Web App depends in the order that they were defined in the Product.wxsli liIve checked for empty properties during uninstall, and thats not it.li liBy removing the iisWebApplication tag element from the WebService App, the Virtual Directory is removed from IIS.li ul  pI cant see what i am doing wrong. Ive read many articles in Stackoverflow about the  but i didnt found this problem. Id really appreciate your help or guideance in the issue.p  pThis is my first post in the site so i beg your pardon if ive made any mistakes.

Negative 8911 pIm trying to build up a method to provide a translation, which can fall back to serve the original text whenever a translation isnt found.p  pI have some standard tables which hold the various kind of content posts, menus, etc in the original language, and then a master translation table which holds the translated values, identified by a language key, a content type reference and the id of the translated item.p  pFor examplep  ptablepostsp  precodeid      title          slug   8  test contenuto  testcontenuto codepre  ptabletranslationp  precode id       title      slug         itemid  itemtype  language    1   test content   testcontent     8        1          2 codepre  pI quite managed to make it work when searching for id, or without where clauses, but Im stuck whenever I need to search based on the slug. What Id like is that, if the slug is aboutus but theres not entry in the translation table it should search for the respective content in the original language, or viceversa. p  pI managed so far using IFNULLs or COALESCEs to serve the content found, but I cant workout a reliable method to put in the WHERE condition.p  pThis query. for example, worksp  precodeSELECT c.id,   COALESCE     SELECT t.slug FROM translations t WHERE t.iditem  c.id     AND t.itemtype  1 AND t.language 2, c.slug     slug,    COALESCE      SELECT t.testo FROM translations t WHERE t.iditem  c.id     AND t.itemtype  1 AND t.language 2, c.testo     testo,     FROM content c    WHERE c.type 2 AND c.status  1 AND c.trash  0 codepre  pFor a query like this, instead, I really cant work outp  precode  SELECT cat.id,   COALESCE       SELECT t.name FROM translations t WHERE t.iditem  cat.id       AND t.itemtype  2 AND t.language  2, cat.name       name   FROM productcategories cat    WHERE cat.slug .... codepre  pI cant for the life of me tell it to search for a translated slug, and if not found in the translation table, get the original slug and use that to get the translated content if there is, otherwise get the origial.p  pI hope I made myself clear on how it should work...My worrings, now,is that I took the problem from a wrong angle, and there are much easier way to solve this. I tried looking at thirdparty code, like the JoomFish extension for Joomla, to see how it works but thats a tripudium of loops and inner loops, I cant really follow it.p  pIs there a better way to solve this How is it done usually Do i need to refactor the whole DB schema, say using a table for each languagep  pstrongEditstrongp  pIm using the WHERE clause to search for the specified records, in the translation table, which has that slug if not found it it means either were looking the site in the original language, or were looking it another language but the translation for that piece is missing.

Now keep in mind, I know that doesnt sound very descript, but hear me out.  strongI dont say that lightlystrong...p  pa hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase1.4.2docsapijavaawtprintPrinterJob.htmlprint28javax.print.attribute.PrintRequestAttributeSet29The official documentation for PrinterJoba actually mentions that the AttributeSet is ignored in the default implementation.  a hrefhttpgrepcode.comfilerepository.grepcode.comjavarootjdkopenjdk6b14javaawtprintPrinterJob.javaSource code seen herea shows this to be true  the attributes are passed in and ignored entirely.p  pSo apparently, you need some sort of extended version of the class, which is possibly based on the specific printers and their capabilities  I attempted to write some test code that would tell me such capabilities  we have a large variety of printers set up at the office, large or small, simple or full of bells and whistles  not to mention several drivers on my computer just for pseudoprinter drivers that just create documents and simulate printers without going to any sort of hardware.  The test code is as followsp  precodepublic static void main String [] args       PrintService[] pservices  PrintServiceLookup.lookupPrintServicesnull, null      for PrintService serv pservices          System.out.printlnserv.toString          printFunctionalityserv, Trays, MediaTray.class         printFunctionalityserv, Copies, Copies.class         printFunctionalityserv, Print Quality, PrintQuality.class         printFunctionalityserv, Color, ColorSupported.class         printFunctionalityserv, Media Size, MediaSize.class         printFunctionalityserv, Accepting Jobs, PrinterIsAcceptingJobs.class        private static void printFunctionalityPrintService serv, String attrName, Classlt extends Attributegt attr      boolean isSupported  serv.isAttributeCategorySupportedattr     System.out.println      attrName     isSupported  Y  N  codepre  pThe results I found were that every printer, without exception, returned that copies were supported, and all other attributes were not.  Furthermore, every printers capabilities were identical, regardless of how implausible that would seem.p  pThe inevitable question is multilayered  How does one send in attributes in a way that they are registered  Additionally, how does one properly detect the capabilities of a printer  Indeed, is the PrinterJob class actually extended in a usable way at all, or are the Attributes always ignoredp  pExamples Ive found throughout The Internet seem to suggest to me that the answer to the latter question is No, they are always ignored, which seems ridiculous to me but increasingly more believable as I sift through hundreds of pages.  strongIs this code that Sun simply set up but never got workingstrong to a completed state  If so, strongare there any alternativesstrongp

Negative 8911 pI have an HTML5 canvas app with a couple normal buttons underneath.  I have tooltips on the buttons, and they seem to work fine under static circumstances.  I still dont understand why tooltips for disabled buttons appear differently from tooltips for enabled buttons.p  pWhen I hover over an enabled button, its tooltip appears above the button on the canvas surface.  These are normal jQuery tooltips.  When the pointer leaves the button, the tooltip goes away.p  pHowever, if I push the button of course the tooltip is showing at that point, my button starts an animated sequence on the canvas, and strongthe tooltip stays there on the canvas foreverstrong.  Moving the mouse elsewhere doesnt cancel the tooltip after animation starts.  Other tooltips continue to work fine.p  pIn the process of animation I am clearing and redrawing the canvas dozens of times, but the tooltip remains visible, so it is its own rectangle separate from the canvas.p  pI tried setting the button title to null and empty before redrawing in the animation.  Neither helped.  Id like to create a synthetic mouseleave for the button, but I dont know how to do that.p  pThis happens on Chrome and Firefox.p  pAny other thoughtsp  pstrongAnswerstrong As I cut down my substantial program trying to create a small fiddle, as Wolf suggested, I found the source of the problem.p  pOnce you disable a button, its tooltip wont go away.  If you undisable the button, the tooltip still doesnt go away.  But if you then hover over the button in the undisabled state and then unhover, the tooltip will go away.p  pApparently, the code that handles the tooltip browser doesnt process the button tooltip on mouseleave if the button is disabled.  But it will properly process any mouseleave after the button is reenabled.p  pI consider this a bug, and I dont see a good workaround.  I cant know whether the tooltip is showing when I want to disable the button.  I will submit it to the jQuery team.p  pThank you for listening.p  pstrongWorkaroundstrong call buttonid.mouseleave before disabling button.  The bug appears to be in several browsers, and it may even be called a feature, so its not likely to be fixed soon.  The workaround has the disadvantage that it makes the user move the pointer to get the tooltip back, so a proper solution in the browsers would be better.  But at least there is a reasonable workaround.p
Negative 8911 pI am trying to build a project with PCL. I am using pcl, vtk5.8 and eigen3. I am also using boost. p  pIn usrinclude boost 1.46 is there by default and I have built my own version of boost 1.5.1. When adding the path to boost 1.5.1 include dir to the include path in propertiesbuildsettings I get errors on launch as my app is being compiled against the files in usrincludeboost and not the 1.5.1 version. So when I dont include my boost 1.5.1 version everything runs fine.p  pMy question is, howwhy is eclipse finding usrinclude as an include path this has not been explicitly added and how can I stop it doing thisp

Negative 8911 pI am running a series of large simulations over a grid. I am implementing the simulations by row and I have found that my sampling functions are a bottleneck. Ive attempted to use the foreach and doMC libraries to speed up the process, but Ive found that either the parallel method is slower or Ive been unable to code a function that would would be correctly interpreted by foreach. p  pLooking at some other posts, It appears that my approach using foreach may be misguided in that the number of jobs Im attempting greatly exceeds the number of available processors. Im wondering if folks would have some suggestions for how to best implement parallelization in my situation. My simulations generally come in two types. In the first I calculate a matrix that contains a sampling interval rows for each element within the gridrow that I am processing. I then sample using runif in the real simulations my rows contain  9000 cells and Im performing 10000 simulations.  p  precodenumber of simulations per element  n  5  Generate an example sampling interval. m.int1 lt matrix  seq  1, 20, 1 , ncol10, nrow2   Define a function to sample over the interval defined in m.int1 f.rand1 lt functiona  return  runif  n, a[1], a[2]     run the simulation with each columns corresponding to the row element and rows  the simultions. sim1 lt round apply  m.int1, 2, f.rand1   codepre  pIn the second case, I am attempting to sample from a set of empirical distributions that are indexed by column in a matrix. The value of the gridrow element corresponds to the column to be sampled.p  precodenumber of simulations per element  n  5  generate a vector represeting a row of grid values  v.int2 lt roundrunif10,1,3  define matrix of data that contains the distributions to be sampled. m.samplesltcbindrep5,10,rep4,10,rep3,10    f.sample lt functiona  return  sample  m.samples [ ,a], n,     Sample m.samples indexed by column number. sim2lt sapplyv.int2,f.sample codepre  pIn the second example, I was able to utilize emforeachem and emdoparem to run in parallel, but the simulation took substantially longer than the serial code. In the case of the first example above, I could not write a proper function to take advantage of foreach parallelization. Ill put the code I used in the second case just to demonstrate my thinking  but I now realize that my approach is too costly in overhead.p  precodelibraryforeach librarydoMC registerDoMC2  n  5  Sample m.samples indexed by column number using parallel method. sim2.par lt foreach  i  1  length  v.int2 ,      .combinecbind dopar sample        m.samples [ , v.int2 [i] ] , n  codepre  pId appreciate some suggestions on an approach and some code that would help me utilizing parallelization efficiently. Again, the rows Im processing generally contain about 9000 elements and were conducting 10000 simulations per element. So my output simulation matrices are generally on the order of 10000 X 9000. Thanks for your help.p

Negative 8911 pI am trying to use bootstraps typeahead as a flexible select for users. So if the item is known they select it if not a dialogue opens up allowing them to enter a new item. p  pI am doing this by watching for the change event on the input, if the inputs val is not in the source array for the the typeahead then the add item dialogue is shown to the user.

This is as the click will cause a blur on the text.p  pI wanted to check the active element to get around this, so in the change event look at document.activeElement and see if it is one of the typeahead options, this did not work and returned the entire body element.p  pHere is a trimmed down version of the codep  pstrongHtmlstrong     p  precodeltdiv idcontactModal classmodal hide fade tabindex1 roledialog arialabelledbymyModalLabel ariahiddentruegt   ltdiv classmodalheadergt     ltbutton typebutton classclose datadismissmodal ariahiddentruegtltbuttongt     lth3 idmyModalLabelgtUnknown Contactlth3gt   ltdivgt   ltdiv classmodalbodygt     ltpgtThe contact you have entered is unknown.

Negative 8911 pI was just having a play around with Entity Framework Code First and came to a stand still on the best way to relate a group of tables. I may be looking at this in completely the wrong way, in which case it would great if someone could point me in the right direction.p  pBasically I have 3 tables, 2 main tables and 1 which holds common fields for both tables.p  pNow, where Im stuck is on what type of relationship I should setup between the 2 main tables and the 3rd table. The two main tables will always have 11 relationships with the 3rd table, however the 3rd table will either be related to table 1 OR table 2 not both.p  pAm I possibly not looking at this in the right way and should I just get rid of the third table and just have the common fields replicated in both tablesp  pHere is what the structure of my tables look like at the mommentp  pTable 1br   Idbr   RatePricingIdbr   Namebr   CreatedOnbr   ModifiedOnp  pTable 2br   Idbr   RatePricingIdbr   Namebr   StartOnbr   EndOnbr   CreatedOnbr   ModifiedOnbr p  pTable 3 Common Fieldsbr   Idbr   Mondaybr   Tuesdaybr   Wednesdaybr   Thursdaybr   Fridaybr   Saturdaybr   Sundaybr   MinNightsbr   CheckInOutDaysbr   RateTypebr   CreatedOnbr   ModifiedOnp  pCheers,p  pTomp  pEDITp  pI originally had it setup so table 1 amp 2 had a foreign key to table 3, however the issue came when using this in entity framework, this is because the table 3 POCO object would now have an ICollection of both table 1 and table 2 when it would only really be related to one of the table objects.p

However, I saw mentions of MVVM and looked it up, and decided I wanted to create the menu dynamically from a collection.p  pThis is all well and good, I found a lot of material regarding the subject and ended up with the following ViewModel for my MenuItemsp  precodeclass MenuItemViewModel      public string Text  get set      public ICommand Command  get set      public ObservableCollectionltMenuItemViewModelgt Children              get                      return new ObservableCollectionltMenuItemViewModelgtchildren                    private ListltMenuItemViewModelgt children      public MenuItemViewModel              children  new ListltMenuItemViewModelgt       codepre  pAnd the View with extrasp  precodeltWindow xClassGUI.MainWindow     xmlns               TitleHTXFormler Height350 Width525     WindowStartupLocationCenterScreengt ltWindow.Resourcesgt     ltStyle TargetTypexType MenuItemgt         ltSetter PropertyHeader ValueBinding PathTextgt         ltSetter PropertyCommand ValueBinding PathCommandgt     ltStylegt     ltHierarchicalDataTemplate      DataTypexType vmMenuItemViewModel     ItemsSourceBinding PathChildrengt     ltHierarchicalDataTemplategt ltWindow.Resourcesgt  ltDockPanel KeyboardNavigation.TabNavigationNonegt     ltMenu DockPanel.DockTop ItemsSourceBinding PathChildren gt ltDockPanelgt codepre  pp  pAs far as I can tell, the binding is fine, but whatever I do, I cannot get the menu to display anything what so ever.br I have a feeling it is because I am using the wrong ItemsSource, so I tried doing the followingp  precodeclass MainWindowViewModel      region Fields      ReadOnlyCollectionltMenuItemViewModelgt menuItems      endregion      region Menu      public ReadOnlyCollectionltMenuItemViewModelgt Children              get                      if menuItems  null                              ListltMenuItemViewModelgt menuItems  this.PopulateMenu                 menuItems  new ReadOnlyCollectionltMenuItemViewModelgtmenuItems                          return menuItems                    ListltMenuItemViewModelgt PopulateMenu              return new ListltMenuItemViewModelgt                      new MenuItemViewModel                    endregion  codepre  pBut to no avail.

Negative 8911 pIm trying to figure out the cleanest way to take a python dict that I have in a django view and get that into a pie chart series in highcharts.  Specifically, when I click on a point in one chart on my page, Im trying to load a second chart with detailed data on that point. p  pFor example, I might have a column chart with inventory for fruit, meat, vegetables.  If I click on a column, a second chart displays the inventory breakdown.  AKA The second fruit chart would show the inventory for apples, oranges, bananas in a pie graph.p  pIm trying to do this with jQuery.get since I dont want to reload the entire page.

Im not sure if this is the right way at all. Should I be doing this by rendering the context in a django template  If so, how would something like that look like inside a jQueryajax success handlerp  pIt seems like going from a dict to a highcharts series with the aforementioned format with the dict key as the x and dict value as the y  would be something that many folks have done so I think Im missing something.p

Negative 8911 pWe usually use interfaces or sysfs or ifenslave in linux Ubuntu to configure bonding interfaces for aggregating two or more NIC cards. Then, there is netlink library that allows us to create and delete bonds and add and remove interfaces from it.

This information usually resides in p  precode sysclassnetbondx...  codepre  pand in bondingmasters and we need to do something like p  precode  ifconfig bond0 down  echo 6 gt sysclassnetbond0bondingmode codepre  pto change its bonding mode to balancealb dynamically, i.e. without reboot or restarting networking by altering the interfaces files.

Then when looping through the second file, I want to add the 2nd files settings for the enabled, priority, blocking for the same SigName so to the key in the last 3 value slots.p  pI will then compare this against itself, like if signame0  signame3 so if file 1 enabled is not the same as file two enabled make a note and tell me. p  pBut the problem I have is not being able to get the data into a dictionary or lookup, Im completely stumped.

Negative 8911 pI have built an application based on HotTowel template and so far it looks great. With a minor problem... It has no account management. SimpleMembership and SimpleRole have been implemented and so far everything works as intended. Accounts are based on ASP.NET MVC SPA template. What I can do is  add new Users only in Seed method there should be no register, only administrator can add people and once they are set, they cant be changed. It is not a problem to include views from SPA template and use those for management, but that doesnt fit into HotTowel very well. Only login fits into this, and logout is being handled in a weird way  hidden  written in index.cshtml and then being called withp  pcode.hiddenLogoutForm.submitcodep  pThe question is  how should I handle account management with currently built application Would this be the time to introduce 2nd breeze manager to handle UserContext or is there any better way Considering I already use AccountController for login and logout, would it be good to make BreezeAccountController or similar name just for breeze readwrites Would loginlogout still work as intended if I just added code[BreezeController]code decorator to AccountController How to best connect Roles and User info Password changes Only UserProfile is visible in the context by default so any other change will have to be saved through some other Action method. Is it worth trying with breeze or just simply write ajax callsp  pAny suggestions are welcome.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 8911 pI am creating extension to postgres in C c. It is new data type that behave like text but it is encrypted by HSM device. But I have problem to use more then one key to protect data. My idea is to get original sql query and process it to choose what key I should use. But I dont know how to do that or if it is even possiblep  pMy goal is to change some existing text fields in database to encrypted ones. And thats why I cant provide key number to my type in direct way. Type must be seen by external app as text.p  pNormally there is userID field and single query always use that id to get or set encrypted data. Base on that field I want to chose key. HSM can have billions of keys in itself and thats mean every user can have its own key. Its not a problem if I need to parse string by myself, I am more then capable of doing that. Performance is not issue too, HSM is so slow that I can encode or decode only couple fields in one second.p

It seems like I am missing something here.p  pWhat is the best practice to raise an codeIOErrorcode exception, so it blends in well with other errors such as emdisk fullem or emfile not foundem, etc.p

My problem is that before perfroming rotation or resizing, the line item exists in local coordinate system with P10,0 and P2x,y. p  pWhen P2 is used as anchor for resizing and rotating and mouse is placed on P1, the P1 takes the mouse eventpos cordinates.

Negative 8911 pIm doing these MVC controllers, and I want to reuse the actions Create, Edit, Delete, etc.p  pSo far, my Models can implement certain interfaces that only have properties. For example If my Model codeCatcode, inherits from codeISingleKeyIndexablecode, that means that codeCatcode will have the property codeIdcode, which can then be used to do database queries.p  pSo far I have done something like thisp  precodepublic class CatController  SingleKeyIndexableControllerltCatgt codepre  pcodeSingleKeyIndexableControllercode has actions like Create, Edit, and Delete. They all depend on the fact that the type given as generic implements codeISingleKeyIndexablecode.p  pThe problem comes when you want to have different flavors of a controller base class. So suppose that some controllers handle Models that are codeISingleKeyIndexablecode, others are codeIStringIndexablecode, and others are NOT codeIDeleteablecode so you dont have the Delete action. You would have to define a class for each different combination of those Interfaces, which is not good.p  pIs there any way to inherit not necessary real inheritance some methods from somewhere else depending on the interfaces implemented by the model type I gave as generic to some other class, or some other approach to work with thisp

Negative 8911 pWe have a windows phone 8 application in which we are using mvvm light having four , five views , and about same number of view models. One day we observed that the size of the application is increasing with usage and eventually reaches more than 100 mb and eventually crashes.After lot of testing what we are able to understand is that every time we navigate to a view , its instance is created and stored in the memory.It was observed that all the instances of the view and the view model are living in the memory and thus increasing the space on the ram. We also confirmed the same by defining finializer on view class and view model , on closing the application the finializer is called exactly the same number of times the page was navigated to. We are binding the datacontext of the view to respective view model in xaml. One of the main view has an ad control , so size increases very fast if user navigates to that view multiple times. How to resolve this issue. What I am unable to understand is the view should be destroyed once the user presses the back button, but this is not happening . Any help would be much appreciated. p

Negative 8911 pI made my Django models and after inserting a testdummy record to my PostgreSQL database Ive realized that my data is quite large for each record. The sum of the data in all fields will be around 700 KB per record. I am estimating I will have around five million records so this will get really large around the 3350 GB mark. Most of my data is big JSON dumps around 70 KB for each field. p  pI am unsure if PostgreSQL will auto compress my data when handling through Django framework. I was wondering whether I should compress my data before entering it into the database. p  pQuestions Does PostgreSQL auto compress my string fields using some codexcode compression algorithm when using Django model field type codeTextFieldcodep  pShould I not rely on PostgreSQL and just compress my data beforehand and then enter it into the DB If so, which compression library should I use I already tried codezlibcode in Python and seems great, but, Ive read that there is codegzipcode library as well and I am confused which would be the most effective in terms of compression and decompression speed as well as the percentage of compression.p  pEDIT I was reading up on a hrefhttpsdjangosnippets.orgsnippets1495 relnofollowthis Django snippet for CompressedTextFielda which sparked my confusion regarding which compression library to use. I saw a few people use codezlibcode while some used codegzipcode.p  pEDIT 2 a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3801416textcompressioninpostgresqlThis stackoverflow questiona says that PostgreSQL does compression of string data automatically.p  pEDIT 3 PostgreSQL uses pglzcompress.c for compression which is a part of the LZ compression family.

Negative 8911 pDue to recent updates to the recent database, I have run into a weird problem. I have two tables, tVehicleDeal table and tVehicleLog table. We did a migration meaning we created an app that will transfer the data from a old database to a more relational database. This process took awhile, but it finished and everything seemed good to go. What happens now, is that anytime tVehicleDeal is updated, the corresponding information is inserted into tVehicleLog. The problem that has occurred is.. I ran a script that would update the current deal in tVehicleDeal to the most recent log in tVehicleLog. I made an error in my script, and not all the current deals in tVehicleDeal were updated properly. As a result, when the users updated the active deal in tVehicleDeal, not all the information was inserted into the tVehicleLog. I need to find a way to update the newest entry with some fields from the past entries such as the date it was titled. Some Deals have as many as 20 different logs for it whereas some may have only 2 or 3. I have found this link a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5574434updaterowwithdatafromanotherrowinthesametableherea but Im not 100 percent positive this is what Im looking for. I have tried something similar to this but I am unable to get anything to work using the examples found on that page. Any other ideas will help greatlyp  pEDIT p  pWhat I am unable to figure out is how to update a column in tVehicleLog. For examplep  pIn the tVehicleLog table there are 6 results for a particular DealID.p  pThe first through 4 do not have a titled date in it, but the 5th row does have a titled date. p  pI cant figure out how to update the titled column the 6th row for that dealID based on the 5th row that does have the titled date. p  pThe link provided above looked like it was something I was looking for but I was unable to get that solution to work.  p

Negative 8911 pim currently building a website which searches an external database and brings up records which match the given search string. The search is live, so results are brought up as the user types. p  pnow the first and current approach i took, is that the page actually connects to the mySQL server and retrieves content via AJAX, with EVERY letter the user types in the search box. p  pnow i am starting to look at JSON objects i only very recently started building websites, and was wondering if it would be a good idea, to load the entire database into a JSON object in the beginning and then look through that when searching. p  pis this a good idea would it be faster thanks in advancep

Negative 8911 pI have a Windows application that is written in C. I have a vector of strings that I need to pass to a python Script for processing. I know how to embed python in C with simple type but I am looking at how to create a python object equivalent to a vector of string.

At the moment I am just saving a text file and I have the python script opening it and processing it which is obviously not very good but it tells me that everything else works as planned. The processing from the Python script produce 4 values per item3 strings and 1 integerlong. I also need to return this the the main C program and I have no idea how to go about that. EDIT After reviewing the possible options, I am thinking of a list of lists since dictionaries are not ordered and require more parsing operations should do the trick but I dont know how I would go about decoding this back inside the C program again for now this is done with file writingreading so I know it works. If anyone has done this, can you please provide small code snippets so I can adapt it to my needs. I should also mention that I cannot use the boost libraryand preferably no SWIG either  so, basically done in Python CAPI. All examples I have seen talks about subprocesses or NumPy which I do not believe maybe incorrectly apply to my case.p

Negative 8911 pWhat is the best way to validate fields in a row and if invalid, correct it to the right formp  pThe simplest example would be checking phone number field can come in variant formats  1111111111, 111 1111111 etc, and we would ideally want to validate these and standardize to one form lets say 1111111111. One way to do this is to use filter rows and then use a regex, or we can use data validator. But this will only tell us what data is invalid but not actually format it for us. We can then use Javascript modified value step to write a js script to do this. But I am guessing there is a better way or a built in integration that I havent come across that would do these basic validations. Or is it recommended to just dump rows containing invalid fields in a separate csv file and then use a script to parse it separatelyp

Negative 8911 pI am developping an asp.net application. An user can upload a csv files where each line is composed of 3 fields name,surname,age. I also have a oracle database where I have a table composed of name,surname,age,country. At each line of the csv, I have to check in my table if the name, the surname are registered in my table. So its very costly in terms of performance. As my table is only updated nightly, I was thinking of copying name,surname of my oracle table in .net collection like a List. so I will have at each csv line to check if the fields are in my list and not to have to do an sql request where I will do a select count. So I have 2 questions  Is this solution of copying my table in .net collection seems good If yes, can you explain me how to copy the content of an oracle table in .net collectionp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 8911 pI am not very well versed in matters of security and web development but I was implementing a web site with a login page and was thinking to implement the best practices.

I was going through the discussion on the page belowp  precodehttpstackoverflow.comquestions1592534whatistokenbasedauthentication codepre  pWhich stipulates the advantages of using token based authentication system over using cookies. However the question that came to my mind was that If user authenticates himself with usernamepassword correctly and successfully gets a token, where do you save that tokenp  pIf I save it in cookie then it is no better than a cookie based system. I am not sure how can client persist that information and not use Cookies May be I am missing something major here but any suggestionsp

The earfile I created using mvn clean install package. Then when starting the application from within de admin console the error is not given. In stead it is reporting that the remote interface of the GebruikerFacade is binded.p  pWhat can be the cause of the error when starting the application server where the earproject is added using add project.p  pExtra info Added 20141211 The reason why the bean class cannot be found is the fact that when the ear is deployed to the webspere application server via add project the business interface is empty within the deployed ear. This is a property in Enterprise Java Bean propertiesBind EJB Business of an Enterprise bean. The module, bean and uri property are set but the business interface which has to be the full path to the Remote interface class is not. When de ear is deployed on the application server via new application the business interface contains the Remote interface Class.p  pConsoleoutput in new answer below.p

Negative 8911 pI have 7 columns representing 7 diferent lets call it sources of input.p  pRow 1 of each column has the names of each source.p  pRow 2 of each column is a sum of all rows from the 4th down. Ex A2  SUMA4A1048576 p  pSince I am suposed to make random entries to each column, I want Row 3 of each column to be standard user input field so that any value input on 3rd row of each column is appended to the first empty cell in that column, triggered by some event keypress, buttonpress, sheetupdate. That is, the first entry to column A in A3 will be put in A4, second entry to A3 should be put in A5 and so on. Same goes for each column, independently. Also, if possible, I want cells in Row 3 to be cleared in the end.p  pHow do i do this Please, answer with full tutorial explanation or a heavily sourced one, because my experience with EXCEL and VBA is close to none.p

There are no errors, it simply seems to freeze and be forever stuck indexing the project. p  pAny help would be appreciated. Looking here there are a few suggestions that it could be a bug in Xcode, but nothing seems to fix the issue. p
Negative 8911 pI need help updating a highcharts chart in a web page after making a roundtrip to the server where I query a database and return some json.  I am drawing a heatmap.

Negative 8911 pmy first question here, but I have been reading and learning an awful lot from this great site.  Short intro, Im a application support specialist for a global company.

Now Im on finetuning duty and Im struggling with the following.p  pIn the XML there are optional fields which are to be filled sometimes, but not always. Trouble is, when the field is empty, the XML will fail. So when empty, the complete tag should not be included. And when the field is filled, then the tag and data should be included in the XMLfile. p  pExamplep  precode SELECT    [LocationName] as name           ,[LocationPhone] as phone           ,[LocationEmail] as email           ,[LocationCountry] as country           ,[LocationCity] as city     FROM [XMLview]     FOR XML PATH Location, ELEMENTS, TYPE codepre  pName, Country and City are mandatory and always filled, but Phone and Email may or may not be empty.p  pThe result is now as followsp  precodeltLocation    ltnamegtBuildingOneltnamegt   ltphone gt   ltemail gt   ltcountrygtNLltcountrygt   ltcitygtAmsterdamltcitygt ltLocationgt codepre  pBut I would want phone and email to be not in the XML when they are empty.p  pI tried using IF EXISTS and IF NOT NULL, but this is not working.

Negative 8911 pIn my app Im processing some files. Some of them may be huge. When a file that is too big to fit in memory is encountered, I want to skip it and politely explain this to the user, showing the partial results from the other files in the end. The files are read in with a codeBufferedReadercode which is discarded after use, no native stuff. I realize more memory than the file size may be needed to load it, so Im checking if 3 times the file size is available. p  pThe problem is that I cant find a way to detect the remaining available memory for the app and an codeOutOfMemoryErrorcode always occurs when loading some file. Ive searched all over SO, but there is no clearcut answer to this. Things Ive tried without luckp  p1p  precodeMemoryInfo mi  new MemoryInfo ActivityManager activityManager  ActivityManager getSystemServiceACTIVITYSERVICE activityManager.getMemoryInfomi long availableMegs  mi.availMem  1048576L codepre  pThis returns a huge number, several hundred megabytes, that is obviously well over the severalmegabytesperapp heap limit.

Negative 8911 pTo make the modules less dependent of specific versions, I would like to test the modules with different versions of the dependencies so I can determine the corners of the version box the module will work happily in.p  pe.g. the module is built in against library foo.bar 2.1.2. Then the tool should test 2.0.0 and if it fails the versions in between like git bisect. Then similar between 2.1.2 and whatever the latest version is. Then do that with the next dependency.p  pI found that it is often rather trivial to extend the range of versions by tweaking how the library is being used. When deploying to an OSGi container, running in a wide set of versions per dependency makes life a lot less painful. However manually testing so many combinations is an absolute nightmare.p  pDoes anybody know of such a tool so it can run on a CI server at nightp  pPS I know such a tool would have all kinds of gnarly edge case and imperfections. I just want to reduce the amount of assumptions that are implicitely being made when building modules. Normal testing will catch these weird cases anyway.p

Negative 8911 pI created some 3D animated gifs using emgnuplotem. I am having trouble seeing all of the splotted data in the gifs. p  pUsing the set view command is not optimal as the splotting is automated and the data varies from plot to plot, so where one view might work for one set of data, it would not work for another set of data. p  pI think it would be good to let the user rotate the axis with hisher mouse in order to see different angles. I know this is possible in for instance the x11 terminal, but can it be done with a gif Perhaps it is possible using the canvas terminal and emJavaScriptem.p  pAnother option might be to rotate the image around an axis automatically, so that when it loads it is already rotating, and continues to rotate as the data is animated. p  pIs there a way to do this in gnuplotp

Negative 8911 pIm trying to create an sqlite query but Im having some problems.p  pLets say that table has three columns id, foreignid and value.p  pI need to select all rows with distinct foreignid with a given value, however that value may not exist for all different foreignids. In which case a row where value is set to some fallback value must be selected such row always exists for that foreignid.p  pI apologize for my english since Im not native english speaker.p  pHere is an example p  pTablep  precodeid  foreignid  value  1   1           1 2   1           2 3   1           3 4   2           1 5   2           3 codepre  pIf desired value is 2 and fallback value is 1 then the query should returnp  precodeid  foreignid  value  2   1           2 4   2           1 codepre  pIt return row with id 1 because it has desired value 2 for foreignid 1. And it return row with id 4 because for foreignid 2 a row with value of 2 does not exits, so it selects a row with fallback value of 1.p  pHope that clears up my question a bit.p

Negative 8911 pMy code works, but it throws the NaN not a number before updating the field correctly.

As I said, it works, but I wonder if theres a cleaner pure jQuery method without crossing back and forth between javascript. Although other solutions with javascript could be useful.  I know I could possibly put some kind of if not datepicker logic somewhere, but need the syntax and best practice do it.   p  pReason for asking  The answer in multiple places was to just use p  precode    newdate.setDatenewdate.getDate  1 codepre  pHowever this answer was not working until I found the additional concatenating setup to put together the final mmddyyyy format to resolve, also I didnt see a good jQuery on document.ready listening for a blur event solution to update another dated field in any other article so figure this would be worth the time to have discussed. p  pAlso a hrefhttpwww.generationsavon.comhalldatefixmod relnofollowheres a linka to the page with the form and the fixdate field thats populated.p  precodeltscript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.11.2jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt  ltscriptgt  document.readyfunction  input64.blurfunction   var tt  input64.val   alerttt  var date  new Datett var newdate  new Datedate  newdate.setDatenewdate.getDate  1  var dd  newdate.getDate var mm  newdate.getMonth  1 var y  newdate.getFullYear  var FixDate  mm    dd    y   alertFixDate  input614.attrvalue,FixDate         ltscriptgt  codepre  pa hrefhttpwww.megalayer.com relnofollowMegalayer Complete End to End Managed Website Solutionsap

And one more thing when I have a final post and Im trying to shown only category on template, I still have IMAGES Digital Art, but I need only IMAGES.

So I need to find any instance of the Value of Billing1 and change it to Billing2 not knowing the user or computer object.  I can successfully change one at a time if I know who the user is by using SetADUser, SetADComputer and even with SetAdObject but I need to figure out a Find and replace function.p  pI have searched for this and I have found examples of where I can use CSV for users and computers but again I dont know who has what since the value in the attribute can vary and also changes if a reorg happens.p

Negative 8911 pI am trying to simulate emrealisticem piano sounds by making a program on MATLAB. Certainly a codesoundcode function that converts a monofrequency sine wave generates a monotonous sound, like the sound from a tuning fork. The key point to make the sound realistic, I guess, is to strongsimulate based on harmonics and overtone propertiesstrong of the piano, which I think are multiples of the fundamental frequency. Each musical instrument has its unique properties of overtones, so human ears can distinguish them based on their sounds.p  h2My attempth2  pHere is one relative amplitudefrequency chart from a physics course. For piano it shows two peaks the first higher one occurs at starting point, and the other at around 750 Hz. A trough approximately exists at round 500 Hz, and the overtones disappear at around 2,500 Hz. I set the fundamental frequency to be a standard C4 261.625 Hz, superposed higherfrequency overtone waves together, and followed the chart to set their relative amplitudes. This time the sounds tone is higher, but it still sounds like a monofrequency wave far from real.p  pa hrefhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0B54YbKOZovjKZHF4dTI3SVA5ZUkviewuspsharing relnofollowthe chartap  h2Questionsh2  ol liI am wondering if the problem could be solved simply by more accurate information of pianos overtone properties. If so, could anyone help me provide this info If not, what other factors should be considered to simulate realistic soundli liAnother idea is to first get a piece of pure piano sound by extracting from an iOS piano app such as Real Piano. Then stronga frequency distribution could be calculated by performing codeFFTcode to the soundstrong, and theoretically I could follow this to superpose waves of certain frequencies. But the problem is the result of codeFFTcode is a vector of complex numbers. Usually I tend to use all real numbers while adding sine waves of different frequencies to generate the audio. So, is there a way to interpret the codeFFTcode result as the sinecosine waves frequency distribution in real domain I guess only using the absolute value of codeFFTcode would not be fine Or how should I operate the superposition in complex domain, following the codeFFTcode resultli ol  pThanks a lot for your ideas and helpp

Negative 8911 pIve recently set up a custom view that uses Search Terms as a contextual filter and sorts based on search score. The problem Im having is if the user provides multiple terms it doesnt always return proper, or any results. If I put in one term or the other it works. If I wrap the terms in quotes e.g. term1 term2 it works provided that those two actually appear as a phrase somewhere. However if I just put in both words it seems to focus mostly on the first term, but even then the results are different than if I had just put in the first term only for example it actually wont return any of the results that have the two words as a phrase. Has anyone seen this weird behavior with Drupal search, and if so how do you fix itp

Negative 8911 pI am building an SSRS report using a cube. I would like to add two parameters, so that they cascade. I would like to use the same Dimension AND hierarchy for both parameters. p  pFor example, if I have strongPerson  Department  Domain  Unitstrong, then I would like the first parameter to have Domain be the values. Then when the user makes a selection for the first parameter, I would like the second parameter to have results filtered based on the first selection. So after the user chooses a Domain, then they can pick a Unit, and these units would be filtered based on the Domain selection. p  pThe problem is that when I try to set up the second parameter, the Department hierarchy is not available, and this is an issue because Unit is under the same hierarchy. I can only provide a hierarchy once for a parameter, then after it is not an available option to choose in Query Designer for a second parameter. p  pDoes any one know why this is or a work around.

Negative 8911 pI am instructed to crop out the white background of a JPEG image in MS Office Picture Manager. The image is a multicolored shape on a white background, with no white anywhere else in the picture, so there is no danger of cropping out anything but the background if I somehow remove all the white color. But I confess to being utterly clueless, having never done it. How do I crop out just the background If I simply resize the rectangular crop area, some white will remain. The question is, how do I crop out just the backgroundp  pI have no Photoshop installed on my machine. I guess making the background transparent would also work, but I dont know how to do that, either. Searching for background under MS Office Help turns up nothing but instructions on how to make the picture my background image, and I cant find much that is helpful on the Web either.

So Is there any way to refill pixels with color Or Is there any other way to erase color from image of canvas  Any reply will be appreciated.p  pcode snippet for filling color on Image of canvasp  precodevar ctx  canvas.getContext2d,     img  new Image img.onload  draw img.crossOrigin  anonymous img.src  httpsdl.dropboxusercontent.coms1alt1303g9zpemdUFBxY.png      function drawcolor        ctx.drawImageimg, 0, 0          canvas.onclick  functione        var rect  canvas.getBoundingClientRect        var x  e.clientXrect.left,            y  e.clientYrect.top          ctx.globalCompositeOperation  sourceatop         ctx.fillStyle  blue         ctx.beginPath         ctx.arcx5,y5,10,0,2Math.PI         ctx.fill         codepre  pcode snippet for erasing color on Image of canvasp  precodefunction       Creates a new canvas element and appends it as a child      to the parent element, and returns the reference to      the newly created canvas element       function createCanvasparent, width, height          var canvas           canvas.node  document.createElementcanvas         canvas.context  canvas.node.getContext2d         canvas.node.width  width  100         canvas.node.height  height  100         parent.appendChildcanvas.node         return canvas           function initcontainer, width, height, fillColor          var canvas  createCanvascontainer, width, height         var ctx  canvas.context          define a custom fillCircle method         ctx.fillCircle  functionx, y, radius, fillColor              this.fillStyle  fillColor             this.beginPath             this.moveTox, y             this.arcx, y, radius, 0, Math.PI  2, false             this.fill                  ctx.clearTo  functionfillColor              ctx.fillStyle  fillColor             ctx.fillRect0, 0, width, height                  ctx.clearTofillColor  ddd           bind mouse events         canvas.node.onmousemove  functione              if canvas.isDrawing                 return                          var x  e.pageX  this.offsetLeft             var y  e.pageY  this.offsetTop             var radius  10  or whatever             var fillColor  ff0000             ctx.globalCompositeOperation  destinationout             ctx.fillCirclex, y, radius, fillColor                  canvas.node.onmousedown  functione              canvas.isDrawing  true                  canvas.node.onmouseup  functione              canvas.isDrawing  false                    var container  document.getElementByIdcanvas     initcontainer, 531, 438, ddd   codepre

Negative 8911 pI am trying a show a console like screen in the ios app for ongoing current activities. I was able to make the GUI and other process. The data constantly written to a text file and textview parallel. As the textview has a limit to get max characters in its container, I am braking the data into chunks and fetching 10000 characters of old data if scrollbar goes towards top navigaitonbar and latest if goes downwards. The problem is, the scrolling becomes and handling data is difficult. Is there any plugin or working solution which works like xcode log console screen without any issue.p
