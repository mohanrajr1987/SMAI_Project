Positive 5263 pThere are lots of tutorials out there describing how to fetch JSON objects from the web and map them to Core Data.p  pIm currently working on an iOS later Android as well app which loads json objects from web and displays them to the user. In my opinion all this mapping from and to Core Data is an overhead in this case, it would be much easier to save the JSON objects directly and use them as cache in the app. Are there librariesdocumented ways how to achieve fetching json objects, save them locally and fetch them with a predefined identifierp  pI would love to fetch e.g. 10 objects, show them to the user and save the data locally. The next time the user is on that list the local data is shown and in the background the jsonfile is fetched again to be uptodate. I guess this is a common use case but I didnt find any tutorialsframeworks enabling exactly this.p

Positive 5263 pFor a detail view I would like to let the user leave notes for each item.  The app is for a datadriven website.  In the web version, the web app stores notes in a separate table with a field for the itemid.p  pIn Core Data I have an entity of items and another entity of notes.  The notes entity has an attribute called codeitemidcode.

Or, I have an incrementing case id number in another instance...cant imagine that going further than  few hundred people.  p  pAnd heres the deal...Its clear that true computer science folk think of numbers differently, taking into account factors like the architecture thats going to be processing the numbers, the space required to process and store the data, backwards compatibility, future proofing, etc.  When I think of numbers, I basically think of how large a value is being represented.  So when I get to that point of my process when I have to choose between three types of integers, I basically say to myself, Well, this is going to be a small number, lets just use the Int 16 option..., or Shoot, I could end up with a really big number here so lets use the Int 64 choice.  Basically, I pick these data types with the same sort of logic I use when ordering fries...if Im really hungry I go for the large, if Im feeling a big guilty Ill just get the small.  p  pIm learning enough to know that Im not thinking about this in the right terms, but I dont really know why, and I dont know the appropriate way to choose the best option.

Take a look at the following code block for clarification.p  precode Add Address to Person [newPerson setValue[NSSet setWithObjectnewAddress] forKeyaddresses]   Save Managed Object Context ... codepre  pWe call save on the managed object context of the newPerson object to propagate the changes to the persistent store.

Positive 5263 pI have been developing a Cocoa app with Core Data. Initially everything seemed fine, but as I added data to the application, I found that the initial data window took ages to load. To fix that, I moved to another startup window that didnt have the data, so startup was snappy. However, no matter what I do, my first fetch AND my first attempt to load a data window with tables views are always slow. That is, if I fetch slowly and then ask for the data window, both will be slow the first time around. After that, performance is acceptable. p  pI traced through my application and found that while I can quickly step through the program, no matter what, the step that retrieves the persistent store coordinator is incredibly slow ... 15  20 seconds can elapse with a spinning beach ball.p  pIve read elsewhere that I might want to denormalize the data. I dont think that will be sufficient. An earlier version was far less interconnected between the entities, and it still was a slug at startup. Now Im looking at entities that may have as high as 18,000 managed objects. Some of the relations are essential to having the data work correctly. p  pIve also read about the option of employing a separate managed object context in the background. The problem with this is that even this background context would take too long to be usable. If the user tries to run a search, he or she will still be waiting forever for that context to load. I might buy myself a few seconds while the user decides what to type in to the search field, but I cant afford to stall for 25 seconds.p  pI noticed that once data is imported into the persistent store, even searches on a table that is not related to others and only has 1000 objects still takes ages to load. The reason seems to be that its the coordinator retrieval itself thats slow, not the actual fetch or the context.p  pCan anyone point me in the right direction on how to resolve this Thanksp

Its took me ages to achieve this and Im not completely understand how its working .   p  pNow on top of this i have a few variables that can control the displayed output like codetblrowhdrcode that will underline and bold the text in each entry. Since codetblrowhdrcode is common for all codetabletermsandabbrcode tables it just sounds logical to me not having this in xml rather put the call to the codetblrowhdrcode inside the codetabletermsandabbrcode template and here i stuck. p
Negative 5263 pI understand that boxing and unboxing is about casting real type to object... object to real type. But I do not understand what the MSDN say about it with the Nullable. Here is the text I do not understandp  blockquote   pWhen a nullable type is boxed, the common language runtime automatically boxes the underlying value of the Nullable object, not the Nullable object itself. That is, if the HasValue property is true, the contents of the Value property is boxed. When the underlying value of a nullable type is unboxed, the common language runtime creates a new Nullable structure initialized to the underlying value. a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryb3h38hb0.aspxSourceap blockquote  pWhen you change your object to a real type, the real type variable that was nullable will be the type of object I do not get itp

Some of these smaller assemblies will have interdependencies, but far from all of them, because the architecture of the code is pretty loosely coupled already.p  pNote that these feature sets are not trivial and small unto themselves either... it encompasses things like clientserver communications, serialisation, custom collection types, fileIO abstractions, common routine libraries, threading libraries, standard logging, etc.p  pI see that a previous question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions568780whatisbettermanysmallassembliesoronebigassemblyWhat is better, many small assemblies, or one big assemblya kindof addresses this issue, but with what seems to be even finer granularity that this, which makes me wonder if the answers there still apply in this casep  pAlso, in the various questions that skirt close to this topic a common answer is that having too many assemblies has caused unspecified pain and problems. I would really like to know concretely what the possible downsides of this approach could be.p  pI agree that adding 8 assemblies when before only 1 was needed is a bit of a pain, but having to include a big monolithic library for every application is also not exactly ideal... plus adding the 8 assemblies is something you do only once, so I have very little sympathy for that argument even tho I would probably complain along with everyone else at first.p  pstrongAddendumstrongbr  So far I have seen no convinging reasons against smaller assemblies, so I think I will proceed for now as if this is a nonissue. If anyone can think of good solid reasons with verifiable facts to back them up I would still be very interested to hear about them.

Negative 5263 pIf foouser.cpp depends on foo.h, then foouser.cpp is built, and then foo.hs modification time is set to further in the past, make will not rebuild foouser.cpp because foo.cpp is newer. Id prefer it if make recorded the modification times of dependencies, and if they changed at all newer or older, to consider targets of that dependency to be out of date. Can GNU make do this If not, is there an easy alternativep  pIn case youre curious how this situation arises foo.h resides in a symlinked folder. The symlink may point to the foolib1.0 folder, the foolib2.0 folder, etc. When the symlink points at a different version of the library, even an older version, foouser.cpp should be rebuilt. If I simply specifiy symlinkfolderfoo.h as a dependency of foouser.cpp, make only pays attention to the timestamp of foo.h, not the timestamp of the symlinkd directory through which foo.h is accessed. I cant add the symlink itself as a dependency, because the make rule is generated by the compiler GCC has a special flag that when given causes it to output a make rule for all the headers a source file depends on.p

Negative 5263 pI need to know via javascript whether a page has focus or not.p  pWhen the user switches to another tab, minimizes the browser, or clicks outside the browser, the page shouldnt have focus.p  pWhen the user returns to the window, by opening it, returning to the tab, clicking on the page, the page needs to have focus.p  pThe problem is the method must correctly report whether the page has focus or not when there is a flash swf on the page that may or may not have focus and I dont have control of the swf content.p  pThe windows focus needs to be independent of the flash swfs focus. So when the swf has focus, the user leaves the browser whilst the flash swf has focus, or when the user returns directly to the swf, the windows focus must be reported correctly.p  pI have methods of doing this in FireFox 3.0, 3.5, IE 6, 7, 8, Safari 4.0.3, 4.0.4, Opera 9.0.p  pThe standard focusblur window events do not work properly in Google Chrome. When the flash swf gains focus, the window loses it the window blur event is triggered. This is not desired.p  pI need a method that will work in Google Chrome 3 and 4.p  pIdeally, I would also like a method that works in FireFox 2 and Safari lt 4.0.3. In these browsers, focusblur do not work either as if the flash swf has focus and you leave the window, the blur window event is not triggered at all.p

Negative 5263 pOK, so I work for a company who has openly adopted agile practices for development in recent years.  Our unit tests and code quality are improving.  One area we still are working on is to find what works best for us in the automated acceptance test arena.  We want to take our well formed user stories and use these to drive the code in a test driven manner.  This will also give us acceptance level tests for each user story which we can then automate.  p  pTo date, weve tried Fit, Fitnesse and Selenium.  Each have their advantages, but weve also had real issues with them as well.  With Fit and Fitnesse, we cant help but feel they overcomplicate things and weve had many technical issues using them.  The business havent fully bought in these tools and arent particularly keen on maintaining the scripts all the time and arent big fans of the table style.  Selenium is really good, but slow and relies on real time data and resources.p  pOne approach we are now considering is the use of the JUnit framework to provide similiar functionality.  Rather than testing just a small unit of work using JUnit, why not use it to write a test using the JUnit framework to cover an acceptance level swath of the application  I.e. take a new story As a user I would like to see basic details of my policy... and write a test in JUnit which starts executing application code at the point of entry for the policy details link but covers all code and logic down to the stubbed data access layer and back to the point of forwarding to the next page in the application, asserting on what data the user should see on that page.p  pThis seems to me to have the following advantagesp  ul liSimplicity no additional frameworks requiredli liZero effort to integrate with our Continuous Integration build server since it already handles our JUnit testsli liFull skillset already present in the team its just a JUnit test after allli ul  pAnd the downsides beingp  ul liLess customer involvement though they are heavily involved in writing the user stories in the first place from which the acceptance tests will be writtenli liPerhaps more difficult to understand or make understood the user story and acceptance criteria in a JUnit class verses a freetext specification ala Fit or Fitnesseli ul  pSo, my question is really, have you ever tried this method  Ever considered it  What are your thoughts  What do you like and dislike about this approach  Finally, please only mention alternative frameworks if you can say why you like or dislike them more than this approach. p

Negative 5263 pI have a custom control called codeTextBoxWithLabelAndUnitscode. From the name, you can tell that its a codeTextBoxcode that has a codeLabelcode before it and a codeLabelcode after it, so that the custom control looks like thisp  precode        Label                 units         codepre  pI expose several dependency properties to configure the control, such asp  precodeLabelWidth LabelText UnitText TextBoxWidth codepre  pNow I have a user control called codeLatLongcode that Im using for LatitudeLongitude input.

However, Id like the user control to expose properties so I can change the labels if I dont like the default settings. I can expose each one as a new dependency property to look like thisp  precodeLatitudeLabelWidth LatitudeLabelText LatitudeUnitText LatitudeTextBoxWidth  LongitudeLabelWidth LongitudeLabelText LongitudeUnitText LongitudeTextBoxWidth codepre  pAnd the XAML for something that uses a codeLatLongcode control will look like thisp  precodeltWindow ...gt     ltLatLong LatitudeLabelTextLatitude in degrees              LatitudeUnitText              LongitudeLabelTextLongitude in degrees              LongitudeUnitText     gt ltWindowgt codepre  pBut that seems like a lot of work since I have to reexpose every dependency property for each instance. I was wondering if there was an easier way that exposes the codeTextBoxWithLabelAndUnitscode instance itself, so I can edit the properties directly on it and use XAML that looks like thisp  precodeltWindow ...gt     ltLatLong Latitude.LabelTextLatitude in degrees              Latitude.UnitText              Longitude.LabelTextLongitude in degrees              Longitude.UnitText     gt ltWindowgt codepre  pSo in other words, rather than exposing the properties on each custom control inside the user control, I expose the custom control itself and get access to all the properties using dot notation.p  pDoes anybody know if thats possible to do in WPFp

Should I resort to using the PowerManager and WAKELOCKS as described here a hrefhttpcode.google.comandroidreferenceandroidosPowerManager.html relnofollowhttpcode.google.comandroidreferenceandroidosPowerManager.htmla, or is there another mechanism p
Negative 5263 pIm working on some experiments to try and increase the GPS accuracy on an iPhone by performing weighted averages on data collected over time.

Negative 5263 pI have a couple of questions regarding a modular GWT based application framework. I have some ideas about them but being new to the field of web development I feel they are far from ideal. Id appreciate a few comments and suggestions in this regard. Here are my questionsp  ol lipI am developing a framework which will allow third parties to embed GWT applications into our website and do some communication with them using simple iFrame postMessage. All these third party modules are going to use our SDK which is also GWT based. The problem arises that even though all the modules will be using the same codebase there is going to be a massive overheard in the amount of duplicate Javascript code i.e. our common SDK code base which is quite large being downloaded on the clients machine. This is highly redundant and problematic, not only due to the sheer size of duplicate code but, also due to the fact that subsequent updates of the SDK would require the modules to be recompiled which is going to create a DLL hell kind of scenario in the long run. What is the best way of doing this kind of thing Is there a way where I can have some static GWT code i.e. the SDK and the dynamic GWT module refers to it even if lies on a different domain and it all work happily pli lipThe other part of the problem lies in providing robust scripting front end to the SDK. At first it appears to be trivial since Javascript itself is a scripting language. However, I do not know how to load and call a piece of pure Javascript code at runtime I am willing to put restrictions on the target Javascript i.e. having a function main and unique namespace or something. Furthermore the Javascript will come as a string from a database and not as a full URL. If its doable in Javascript how does one get this right in GWT i.e. forcing the compiler to emit a certain function in the generated Javascript This I believe can be lesser of a problem by having a stub Javascript with all the right requirements which just loads up a GWT generated Javascript. Is any of this possible at all pli ol  pI generally hate to be this verbose but I hope to find a quick solution to the problem as its holding up my progress. Id highly appreciate any comments, suggestions and experiences. p

Negative 5263 pLets say we have two buttons, each with a OnClickListener. Each of listeners show a ProgressDialog and do some background work. Behind the scene is an AsyncTask, the dialog is opened in onPreExecute. I dont think it matters, just for the record.... Lets say there is some rule saying no more than one background worker may be active at any given time. p  pMy assumption was that the Dialog prevents two background workers running at the same time. I thought the modal dialog blocks the UI and its not possible to click another button after the show method of the dialog is called. I was wrong.p  pIf you click the buttons fast enough, its possible to trigger both background workers almost at the same time.

Negative 5263 pI dont really know whether something like this exists, but well, Ill try to explain what Im after.p  pI am sometimes gathering some of various snippets for common tasks Im doing, like, for example, some longer database queries I perform, various linux commands for my daily tasks, and sometimes some php code for things I would have to otherwise search for in my previous projects.p  pNow, I would prefer to have some webbased solution, which would just let me paste my snippets and be kept there [with syntax higlighting of most languages]. However, the usual pastebins are not allowing things like tagging inputs, keeping track of history, authorization and so on. The more complex ones are not open source, and I cant host them myself thats quite the necessity, because sometimes Id like to cover some more sensitive data.

Negative 5263 pI have an Asp.net gridview on a page, when a buttonfield is clicked instead of select it opens a popup form my popup not asps which contains the detail of the gridview row displayed in an editable DetailsView. This approach has been used because the grid contains 20 wideish columns and it is easier to edit  update in the detailsView format The DetailsView takes any amendmends and writes them back to the table, fine, but the underlying Gridview is never visually updated unless of course the page is completely reloaded I tried to use the Windows.reload function but I get the annoying winddows is trying to reopen etc, error, so that is useless. I am trying to discover the best way to get the gridview to refresh its data. I have placed via a Me.ClientScript.RegisterStartupScriptMe.GetType eyc, an alert box to communicate when the update steps of the detailsview fires so I could interject a gridview.ReBind  but because the detailsview is held within the update panel the, for example, Protected Sub DetailsView2ItemUpdatedByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Web.UI.WebControls.DetailsViewUpdatedEventArgs Handles DetailsView2.ItemUpdated functions, and the roqwupdatind and so one, do not appear to fire. they must do of course else the table would not be updating. MY problem is how do I communicate with update events within the panel contained detailsviews so that I can cause a reBind to occur on the main gridview. Any Ideas would be appreciated. Thank youp

Negative 5263 pOk so Ive been trying to teach myself some socket programming. I wrote myself a little C application with an async server and I understand most of it, except for the followingp  pSo the server has a port it listens on for connections then when it receives a connection it creates a different socket to do the communication on. This it what I dont understand... How does the communication happen between the client and the server when in theory the client has no idea what port has been elected for this new connectionp  pThanks for all your answersp  pEdit As far as I understand the listening thread listens on the default port, but all messages are then handled on a different socket for each clientp  pEdit Again Some how you guys are misunderstanding my question. I understand normal socket communication. My problem is with an async server where the listening socket is different from the connecting socket. Ie. p  ol liServer listens on default portli liClient attrmpts to connect.li liServer receiver request.li listrongServer then creates a communication socket between client and server and continues listening on the default port.strongli ol  pMy problem is at the last step. How does the client now know how to communicate on the new socket Here is some sample code a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary5w7b7x5f.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary5w7b7x5f.aspxap

IAudioSamples samples  IAudioSamples.make1024, audioCoder.getChannels             A packet can actually contain multiple sets of samples or frames of samples       in audiodecoding speak.

Negative 5263 pIm running into a bit of a problem. What Im doing Ive got a ListView which has got some images in it. To make the scrolling smoother Ive disabled the images to show up when scrolling. Now there seems to be a a hrefhttpcode.google.compandroidissuesdetailid5086buga in Android which sometimes causes the scroll state to not change back from SCROLLSTATEFLING back to SCROLLSTATEIDLE, which causes my images to not show up again. p  pMy first thought was to set an onTouchListener and check when I get ACTIONUP, but that doesnt help because the SCROLLSTATEFLING  state is obviously being set after that. So now Ive thought I could start a timer when the SCROLLSTATEFLING state is being set and check after some time if the state is still in fling mode and then invalidate my view.

Negative 5263 pI succesfully did Search Replace in doc docx header and footers using a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5637667cantreplacethefootertextinawordapplicationthroughdelphithis questiona. I am using Delphi to control Word via OLE Automation.p  pNow the problem is that that works only for first page in case one sets different header for first page or doesnt work at all if one sets different on oddeven.p  pThis a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarycc546917.aspx relnofollowdocumenta explains it a little more.p  pUPDATEp  pThat document linked above explains that MS Word manages header amp footer as first page  Odd pages  even pages. But it is also possible to choose no one option and in this case all header and footer are the same.p  pIN case one does search and replace using the code I linked above it works only in case no extra options are selected, so in the case one is serachin and replacing in a document where all header and footers are the same.p  pIf by chance that code is used against a document that has differente header for first page selected, serach and replace will occur only on header and footer of first page.p  pWhile it wont work at all if the only option selected is different header and footer on odd and even pages and no different on first page.p  pSo I was asking if one already solved this problem looping coorectly through all cases.

Negative 5263 pThere is one thing that bothers me, C function pointers. Im asking this question because Im trying to implement callback functions used in my game engine. The issue is, for examplep  precode Callback function HRESULT RenderScenefloat fps HRESULT hr return SOK    Set the message mskgtSetMessage0, SMRENDERSCENE, void RenderScene codepre  pThe problem is COM doesnt allow function pointers in their member functions. Also, doesnt allow for polymorphism. As you can see, I made it a void. Fine with me because I know what the callback function is. The main issue is that I want something that is typesafe. Now say if the user doesnt know the callback function declaration. For example,p  precode Callback function HRESULT CALLBACK RenderScene or RenderSceneint fps or RenderSceneint a, int b codepre  pIs implemented in WndProc asp  precode... SMRENDERSCENE void stdcallfloat fps pfn1.0f break ... codepre  pThe first, doesnt have an argument, therefore, he doesnt see fps. The second, loses precision. The third, loses precision and has an unused argument. Do you see where Im going at Tried using a union but COM doesnt allow function pointers in the member function.p  pI tried, and tried again. Nothing works, even the MFC message maps are ugly if they didnt have those macros.p  pTo clarify, I rather have it return an error like codeEFAILcode or codeEINVALIDFUNCTIONcode if the function doesnt match the specification of codeSMRENDERSCENEcode.p  pDoes anyone have a solution to this problem.p  pNote I like the COM specification and Im not going to change, so focus on the issue not about why Im using COM.

Negative 5263 pSo after two days of googling incessantly and apparently asking the wrong questions, I think I have figured out a way to word it so I get the response Im looking for.p  pI have a Project Management application, written in MVC3.  Sometimes, the users have to attach large files and upload them to the applications.  100200 mb is typical.  The problem of course is that this is currently handled synchronously, and varying network speeds mean that the application can be completely blocked for 10 minutes to an hour if someones on a slow connection.  FTP is NOT an option here my hands are tied by our network guys on that one.p  pSo I am looking for a way to do the following workflowp  ul liuser clicks Upload Fileli liuser selects File to uploadli liuser clicks Go or whatever buttonli liApplication says your file is being uploaded.  You will be notified when its completeli liuser continues to use the application as normal.li ul  pSome things to be aware of  I already have an internal messaging system implemented.  So when I say that the app will notify the user when its complete  all it needs to do is insert a new message into the queue.  It DOES NOT need to notify the users current screen or anything like that  so Im not worried about a return value of any kind.  I also have a background Error log implemented, so I can insert a message into the log if something goes wrong and again  inform the user via the internal messaging system.p  pSo I am stumped on how to implement this.  I thought an Async Controller was the right way to go, but if I understand all the stuff Ive been seeing  its not.  Feel free to correct me.  I implemented a version using Async but when addressing the one problem it had, I was informed that I was doing it wrong anyway. p  pSo uh...help  Im all ears.p

Unless there is another trick somewhere, I do not understand what guarantees exist that this operation will be atomic in the assembly domain. I guess  an obvious answer will be that such an operation translates to one assembly opcode, but even so, how is that guaranteed when taking into account the different memory cache levels or other optimizationspli lipOn the read macros, the volatile type is used in a casting trick. Anyone has a clue how this affects the atomicity here Note that it is not used in the write operationpli ol

Negative 5263 pAs far as I understand it, each transaction sees its own version of the database, so the system cannot get the total number of rows from some counter and thus needs to scan an index. But I thought it would be the clustered index on the primary key, not the additional indexes. If I had more than one additional index, which one will be chosen, anywayp  pWhen digging into the matter, Ive noticed another strange thing. Suppose there are two identical tables, Articles and Articles2, each with three columns Id, ViewCount, and Title.  The first has only a clustered PKbased index, while the second one has an additional nonclustered, nonunique index on viewcount. The query codeSELECT COUNT1 FROM Articlescode runs 2 times faster for the table with the additional index. p

Negative 5263 pIm trying to automate some PowerPoint charts, but Im having problems preserving some formatting.p  pWhen I add a chart using a chart template, the chart doesnt use the slides color scheme, but rather the colors it was saved with. It doesnt help to change the color scheme for the slide  the chart isnt updated. To make the chart update to the color scheme of the slide, I have to clear formatting for the chart.

Negative 5263 pPython classes have no concept of publicprivate, so we are told to not touch something that starts with an underscore unless we created it.  But does this not require complete knowledge of all classes from which we inherit, directly or indirectly  Witnessp  precodeclass Baseobject     def initself         superBase, self.init         self.foo  0      def fooself         return self.foo  1  class SubBase     def initself         superSub, self.init         self.foo  None  Sub.foo codepre  pExpectedly, a codeTypeErrorcode is raised when codeNone  1code is evaluated.  So I have to know that codefoocode exists in the base class.  To get around this, codefoocode can be used instead, which solves the problem by mangling the name.  This seems to be, if not elegant, an acceptable solution.  However, what happens if codeBasecode inherits from a class in a separate package called codeSubcode  Now codefoocode in my codeSubcode overrides codefoocode in the grandparent codeSubcode.p  pThis implies that I have to know the entire inheritance chain, including all private objects each uses.  The fact that Python is dynamicallytyped makes this even harder, since there are no declarations to search for.  The worst part, however, is probably the fact codeBasecode might inherit from codeobjectcode right now, but in some future release, it switches to inheriting from codeSubcode.  Clearly if I know codeSubcode is inherited from, I can rename my class, however annoying that is.  But I cant see into the future.p  pIs this not a case where a true private data type would prevent a problem  How, in Python, can I be sure that Im not accidentally stepping on somebodys toes if those toes might spring into existence at some point in the futurep  pemEDITem Ive apparently not made clear the primary question.  Im familiar with name mangling and the difference between a single and a double underscore.  The question is how do I deal with the fact that I might clash with classes emwhose existence I dont know of right nowem  If my parent class which is in a package I did not write happens to start inheriting from a class with the same name as my class, even name mangling wont help.  Am I wrong in seeing this as a corner case that true private members would solve, but that Python has trouble withp  pemEDITem As requested, the following is a full examplep  pFile codeparent.pycodep  precodeclass Subobject     def initself         self.foo  12     def fooself         return self.foo  1 class BaseSub     pass codepre  pFile codesub.pycodep  precodeimport parent class Subparent.Base     def initself         superSub, self.init         self.foo  None Sub.foo codepre  pThe grandparents codefoocode is called, but my codefoocode is used.p  pObviously you wouldnt write code like this yourself, but codeparentcode could easily be provided by a third party, the details of which could change at any time.p

Negative 5263 pI got two Graphics objects, is it possible to combine them into onep  pThe answer of Hovercraft Full of Eels is useful, but not what I meant.

Now, how should I merge them in the codepaintComponentGraphicscode method to draw them to my for example JPanelp  pThe question is not at all about images, but about mere Graphics objects. Sorry, the first paragraph was misleading.p  pstrongEditstrongbr In response to Hovercraft Full of Eelsp  pIf you draw in the codepaintComponentcode method, I find it annoying everything is gone if you redraw your screen, and if you want to move something you have to save the coordinates and dimensions of everything, adjust those and get them someway in your Graphics object.br The question I asked myself was accely What object is best suited or saving a Graphics object. A Graphics object, I thought. but the problem is that if you have for example two rectangles, and one moves to the left and one moves to the right you cant if you have 1 Graphics object.br My solution was multiple graphics objects, which can be transformed to simulate movement and then drawn to the screen.br Hovercraft Full of Eels I think you and most SOers think this is not a good solution, looking at your answer.br But, an answer saying codeYoure doing it all wrong, youd better stop programmingcode doesnt help me at all, so please give me an alternative.p

Negative 5263 pHaving a strange issue with my app where the entire iOS device gets locked up and the only thing I can do is restart the device. I am not seeing any exceptions getting thrown, nor am I seeing any memory leaks in Instruments.p  pThe app has a navigation controller with a main menu. I then push a viewcontroller that has a grid of images being loaded. If I go back and forth between the main menu and the grid the app will crash after 15 times. However, it isnt just the app thats killed, its the entire OS which is something Ive never seen.p  pAt first I thought I was leaking memory, but Leaks isnt showing anything. Im playing around with Allocations and Im seeing that the grid view controller allocation count just keeps going up. The app is using ARC, which I dont like that much because its too magical, but I assumed it would be cleaning up properly. p  pOne thing that concerns me is that viewDidUnload nor dealloc is being called on my grid view controller after it popped from the nav controller, so Im never explicitly cleaning up my images or killing network connections. I assume this is where the issue is at but I dont know when I should kill these because the usual places to clean up ie. viewDidUnload, dealloc arent being called.p  pThis is happening on iPhone and iPad both running 5.1 and Im using the AFNetworking UIImageView category to load images.p  pCheers,p

Negative 5263 pNot a complete noob I am quite new to iOS programming and to OjbectiveC. I mainly come from a background of C DSP, Microcontrollers, Delphi XE2Pascal , Visual Basic and Java desktop and Android apps.p  pI mainly learned Cocoa with the book Beginning iOS 5 Development, from Apress.p  pRecently I watched videos of the WWDC 2012 and went through some of their sample code, and I must say that I am confused of what is the proper way of writing my apps and more specifically with the propertysynthesize words.p  pIn the book most not to say all of the sample code uses to define a property as for examplep  precodeViewController.h property strong, nonatomic NSMutableArray list  ViewController.m synthesize list codepre  pthen all the code access synthesize list withp  precodeself.list codepre  por even simplyp  precodelist codepre  pNow in every WWDC code sample I read I see that programmers define a property but then, in the .m file they do things likep  precodesynthesize list  list codepre  pand access sometimesp  precodeself.list codepre  porp  precodelist codepre  pI am confused. What is the correct practice  As Apple programmers all use underscore I think I should do it that way but why the book did not  Is there a difference between list and list  And more over, as I am in the same object why sometime use self.list and sometimes listlist.p  pSometimes they dont use synthesize, I assume its when they want to rewrite their own accessors and mutators which is never my case up to now.p  pI have read here and there on the web but nothing was clear enough to set my mind right, so I count on StackOverflow to bring light here.p  pLast but not least I prefer and answer based on current iOS 6 best practiceprogramming technique. Useless to tell me how to do it correctly in older iOS.p

Negative 5263 pIm working on a visualizer in WPF which has a function to display a cutting plane through a 3D shape. For example, a 3d geometry like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkT9ZG.png altFull Geometryp  p... is cut with a plane. After cutting, the algorithm identifies all the unique outlines along the cutting plane and populates a list of line segments, in either CW or CCW winding order. Any simple polygon is easy to triangulate and render using the Cutting Ears algorithm, like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comiaI7O.png altCut Plane Image img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comArSZ5.png altenter image description herep  pGiven an input of the triangulation on the right, and the inner polyline visible on the plane surface on the left, is there an algorithm which can reconfigure the triangulation to construct a hole outlined by the polyline p  pIf there are algorithms already rolled in C or another CLR language, Id love to learn about them. Im using the Point3D lists called for by WPF to describe MeshGeometry3D triangle meshes, but I can obviously fill any data structure if needed or spin my own class by studying other language code or pseudocode. p  pEDIT See the accepted answer Im making use of the C implementation of a hrefhttpcode.google.comppoly2tri relnofollowPoly2Tria, a Constrained Delaunay Triangulation. However, images not to scale the Poly2Tri algorithm center failed with a 780segment polyline, while Cutting Ears right did not, until I stripped the inputs of their precision, supplying single precision values upcast as doubles instead of doubles. It now produces a different triangulation than Cutting Ears but respects the boundaries of the outer polyline.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsCh5U.jpg altComplexPoly img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comujKic.jpg altComplexCDT img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMlQkb.jpg altComplexEarsp

So basically, Im using the iq id as a key on this pinging method.  Ill send a ping, and store the iq id, and ill say assume that noDataConnection  true.  Now, if I receive a pong with the same iq id, I assume that the connection is alive, so Ill set noDataConnection  false.  However, if theres no data connection, ill continue to send pings setting noDataConnection  true, and never receiving any so it will remain true unless it recovers and obtained a data connection.p  pExcerpt from a hrefhttpxmpp.orgextensionsxep0199.htmls2c relnofollowhttpxmpp.orgextensionsxep0199.htmls2ca PINGp  precodeltiq fromjulietcapulet.litbalcony tocapulet.lit idc2s1 typegetgt   ltping xmlnsurnxmpppinggt ltiqgt codepre  pPONGp  precodeltiq fromcapulet.lit tojulietcapulet.litbalcony idc2s1 typeresultgt codepre  pMy only concern about this, is what if I received an iq that isnt a result of my ping and my application will assume that noDataConnection  true, since the iq id that it receives doesnt match up to my ping iq id that is sent.

Negative 5263 pIm using two libraries in an android app Im trying to make. New to android. The app is for connecting to serial devices and controlling their console via a terminal. p  pOne library is for setting up a serial connection, setting baud rate etc. and can also write readdata over serial.. The other is for creating a terminal session. My problem lies in incorporating both of these together to have a terminal that is connected to a serial device.p  pIn the terminal library I need to supply an codeInputStreamcode and codeOutputStreamcode to provide input and output to the terminal. So I have to call codesetTermInjava.io.InputStreamcode and codesetTermOutjava.io.OutputStreamcode to connect the input and output streams to the emulator.p  pIn the serial library however there are two methods for sending and receiving and these deal with arrays of bytes.  codesendDatabyte[] datacode for sending data and a dataListener for receiving data. I have to implement this and code the method codeonDataReceivedint id, byte[] datacode with id being the name of the device.p  pI dont have source code for the function that sends an array of bytes over serial, so how do I make the array of bytes into a stream to send to my terminalp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI think this should override it and that is what I wantp  precodePrivate USB2SerialAdapter mSelectedAdapter  ...  public void sendDatabyte[] data  this should echo what I send to the terminal in the correct format ByteArrayOutputStream bos  new ByteArrayOutputStreamdata.length       bos.writedata, 0, data.length  setTermOutbos  send data over serial using original sendData method mSelectedAdapter.sendDatadata  codepre
Negative 5263 pI am working on a location app for the iPhone iOS 6, that constantly sends accurate location information to a web service.  I have it setup so that the app sends a location packet every minute as long as there has been a significant change in position.  This part of the app is working great as a background task, but as you might expect it affects battery life significantly having GPS on all the time I get about 6 hours which isnt too bad given Im used to plugging in my phone in the car and when at home so I can get through the day OK, but I need to stretch this out to at least 16 hours to be practical.p  pWhat I would like to do is turn the GPS off when the phone indicates that it hasnt moved significantly for a while.  This is trivial to do using the GPS data itself.  However, with the GPS off, what might I use as a trigger to turn it back on again, and restart location posting  I could just turn it off when it is sensed that no new position has been generated for say 5 minutes, and then check the position X minutes later to see if it has changed, and act accordingly.  Or maybe I could use the accelerometer in some clever way, or some other sensor, to trigger turning on GPS again.p  pGiven that travel time is often a small part of the day, it makes sense to minimize GPS activity when at home, or in the office... but how to do that reliablyp

Negative 5263 pBasically, I have written a Spotify app thats includes only a single page index.html with all the links triggering javascript codeonclickcode functions that manipulate the DOM.

Negative 5263 pThis one is for legitimate codelxmlcode gurus. I have a web scraping application where I want to iterate over a number of codediv.contentcode content is the class tags on a website. Once in a div.content tag, I want to see if there are any codeltagtcode tags that are the children of codelth3gtcode elements. This seems relatively simple by just trying to create a list using codeXPathcode from the div.cont tag, i.e.,p  precodelinkList  tree.xpathdiv[containsclass,cont]h3a codepre  pThe problem is, I then want to create a codetuplecode that contains the link from the div.content box as well as the text from the paragraph element of the same div.content box. I could obviously iterate over the whole document and store all of the paragraph text as well as all of the links, but I wouldnt have any real way of matching the appropriate paragraphs to the codeltagtcode tags. p  plxmls codeElement.itercode function could ALMOST achieve this by iterating over all of the codediv.contcode elements, ignoring those without codeltagtcode tags, and pairing up the codeparagraphacode combos, but unfortunately there doesnt seem to be any option for iterating over class names, only tag names, with that method. p  pEdit heres an extremely stripped down version of the HTML I want to parsep  precodeltbodygt ltdiv classcontgt     lth1gtRandom Textlth1gt     ltpgtThe text I want to obtainltpgt     lth3gtlta hrefsomelinkgtThe link I want to obtainltagtlth3gt ltdivgt ltbodygt codepre  pThere are a number of div.conts like this that I want to work with  most of them have far more elements than this, but this is just a sketch to give you an idea of what Im working with. p

Negative 5263 pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pI found that when I refactored the filtering logic to take place in a compound computed property within the PostController instead of within individual routes, I was able to get it working. The solution was ultimately dependent upon a single dynamic variable set by the specific linkTo route action that triggered filtering changes within a PostController computed property. I have a lot of work to catch up on so I cant post the solution to this specific question now, but when I can I will detail an explanation of the solution below. For now I have marked twinturbos answer as correct for the partial but incredibly helpful guidance he gave below. Thanks again man Much appreciated p  pstrongUpdate 1strongp  pThe latest fiddle is at a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netaZNRu14httpjsfiddle.netaZNRu14a with twinturbos help, sorting the rank attribute of Comments in its Post parent controller is working, along with basic filtering. Still having the problem of not getting auto updating views when in a filtered route and a new comment is created.p  pstrongOriginal Questionstrongp  pI see that a hrefhttpsgithub.comemberjsember.jspull1562there is talk of combining the sortable mixin with filtering functionalitya, but for now, as you can see in my a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netaZNRu9jsfiddle examplea, Im having issues with both sorting and filtering p  p1 I cant figure out how to sort by a specific child attribute in the controller of its parent. If we have p  precodeApp.Post  DS.Model.extend     title DS.attrstring,     post DS.attrstring,     comments DS.hasManyApp.Comment   App.Comment  DS.Model.extend     post DS.belongsToApp.Post,     description DS.attrstring,     isActive DS.attrboolean,     rank DS.attrnumber   App.Router.mapfunction    this.resourceposts,  path  , function      this.resourcepost,  path postid , function          this.routeactive         this.routeinactive            codepre  pI want to be able to sort each posts comments in ascending order by its rank attribute. I want to do something like p  precodeApp.PostController  Ember.ObjectController.extend     sortProperties [comments.rank] codepre  pbut for one, I think sortProperties only works on arrayControllers, and I dont think it can work more than one level deep. How could I achieve thisp  p2 The second problem is not getting autoupdating views when in a filtered route. For example, if you view the jsfiddle and go into the active filtered route by clicking Active Comments you get a nice filtering effect on the current data. But if you remain in the active route and create a new record that is active by clicking Add New Comment, the record does not automatically render under Active, and only appears if you click on another route and then return to it.p  pAm I setting up the route filtering incorrectly in the route or referencing it wrong in the templatep  precodeApp.PostActiveRoute  Ember.Route.extend   setupController function      var post  this.controllerForpost.getmodel,     comments  post.getcomments      var activeComments  comments.filterfunctioncomment        if comment.getisActive  return true            this.controllerForpost.setfilteredComments, activeComments       ltulgt     each comment in filteredComments         ltligtcomment.rank comment.description  isActive comment.isActiveltligt     each ltulgt codepre  pAny insight you could give on these issues would be greatly appreciated p

Negative 5263 pI recently came upon the strange syntax for explicitly declaring generic types when calling Java methods. For examplep  precodeCollections.ltStringgtemptyList codepre  preturns an empty codeListltStringgtcode. However, this seems silly as the implementation of codeltTgt emptyListcode is just the unchecked type cast codeListltTgt EMPTYLISTcode, such that all results have the same type erasure and are the same object. Moreover, this sort of explicit type declaration is usually not needed because the compiler can often infer the typesp  precodeListltStringgt empty  Collections.emptyList codepre  pAfter doing some more digging I found two other times where youd want to use this syntax, and theyre all due to using the Guava library and strongapparently trying to put too many statements on one linestrong.p  ol lipDecorating a collection, for example with a synchronized wrapper, and the compiler being not able to infer the types. The following doesnt work if you take out the type declaration codecannot convert from SetltObjectgt to SetltStringgtcodep  precodeSetltStringgt set  Collections.synchronizedSetSets.ltStringgtnewHashSet codepreli lipGetting less specific type parameters when they compiler tries to make ones that are too specific. For example, without the type declaration the following statement complains as well codecannot convert from MapltString, Stringgt to MapltString, Objectgtcodep  precodeMapltString, Objectgt toJson  ImmutableMap.ltString, Objectgtoffoo, bar codepreli ol  pI find it ironic that in the first case the inferred type parameters are too general and in the second case they are too specific, but I suppose that is just an artifact of the generics system in Java. p  pHowever, this language construct itself seems to be avoidable except in these a hrefhttpcode.google.compguavalibrariesissuesdetailid883 relnofollowstrange use cases invented by the Guava teama. Moreover, it seems plain to me that strongthere emisem a way for the compiler to infer type arguments in both the above examplesstrong, and the developers just chose not to do so. Are there examples of it ever being necessary or useful to use this construct in Java programming or does it exist solely to make the compiler simpler  JDK developers life easierp

Negative 5263 pmy question is simple, but I cant find it on google, so here I am.p  pBasically, as an example, I am reading in a bunch of integers until EOF from an input file.

How can I check for EOF in this while loop without moving the file pointer when it checks p  pKeep in mind I will be doing something much more complex with this loop than scanning in integers.

Negative 5263 pWe are building a web app which will be used during a contest to vote contestants and display realtime vote statistics on a central display.p  pThe contest will last 15 minutes and around 4000 users will be connecting to the web app in that lapse of time and send votes, which however are unique per user device.p  pWe are thinking to develop such web app using Meteor.js. However, due to our little experience in developing services for such big amount of concurrent users and the beta state of Meteor.js, we have some concerns regarding the actual feasibility of the project. p  pThe following are the questions we are addressingp  ol lipIs there any benchmark on how many concurrent users Meteor can handle I assume this depends from the complexity of the web app itself, in our case it would be rather straight forward, only the client used for the central display will be subscribed to the live Mongo query votes.find, the rest of the users will only see the vote  already voted button. Still having some data from a real case or test scenario would help us a lot.pli lipWould the Meteors infrastructure be able to handle 4000 users Or should we go for some other hosting solution as listed here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13504324wherecanwehostmeteormeteoriteapplicationsWhere can we host MeteorMeteorite applicationsapli lipAre there any performance considerations specific to Meteor.js we should take particular care when coding the apppli ol  pWe have seen already similar posts, however none of them was dealing with such large amount of users in such a short timep  pa hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicmeteortalkRtwIy9Ua9Qhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicmeteortalkRtwIy9Ua9Qa a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13113256howefficientcanmeteorbewhilesharingahugecollectionamongmanyclients1386712213867122How efficient can Meteor be while sharing a huge collection among many clientsap  pAlso have seen this Cluster smart package which could be used in our case a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchv12NkUJEdFCwampfeatureyoutu.behttpwww.youtube.comwatchv12NkUJEdFCwampfeatureyoutu.bea Anyone has any experience with thisp  pThanks to anyone with some Meteor.js experience who could give us his opinion.p

How its possible to tell fragment 2 to load different layout depending on menus item clicked p  pMy answer is I need a fragment class for every different layout. When the user click on an item of fragment 1, the fragment manager should replace and commit the correct fragment. Is this answer correctp  pAll fragment logic will be on my activity, replacing the correct fragment depending on item selected position and category simple exp  precode   Override         public void onItemSelectedint category, int position              if position0             final FragmentTransaction ft  getFragmentManager.beginTransaction             ft.replaceR.id.contentfrag, new FirstActionFragment, FirstMenuClicked             ft.commit                  else              final FragmentTransaction ft  getFragmentManager.beginTransaction             ft.replaceR.id.contentfrag, new SecondActionFragment, secondMenuClicked             ft.commit             codepre  pIs my layout idea improvable Should I change something on my design to correctly implement fragmentationp

Negative 5263 pBefore adding section headers to one of my tables in my app, I was able to delete rows using the commitEditingStyle function without any issues. I decided to implement section headers to make it easier for the user to view items added to the table by date. This functionality works fine. I was having an issue with deleting rows after implementing the section headers but thanks to help from the good folks on stackoverflow the problem was partially resolved. After some testing Ive realized that if the rows are in the same section and I try to delete more than one row in sequence beginning with the top row in the section, the top row deletes fine but trying to delete the second row causes the app to crash. If I delete all rows in sequence other than the first row and then delete the first row last, it works fine.

Its placed in the middle of the knob, a part of the left side is cut off, on the right side it gets doubeled. p  pWhen initializing the NSSlider the frame is big enough to fit the image in, but doesnt get displayed proberly.p  pI tried a sublass of NSSlider in which I used voidsizeToFit  but I did not really know what to set in there.p  pI hope we can post here one sample Code of a NSSlider with custom knob image everyone can use and doesnt have to google for 23 hours.p  pIm shure someone has done a Slider with a custom imagep  pThanksp

Negative 5263 h2First off, some backgroundh2  pMy client has a kind of a splitview, meaning a emsidepanelem displaying a list of objects and a emmain viewem displaying the emselectedem objects details. Every time the user clicks on an Object in the list, a Backbones route is called to navigate to the id which updates a strongselectedstrong property on the emSessionem, what causes the emmain viewem to update pretty standard stuff.p  h2The problemh2  pI want the client to be as responsive as possible, therefore im trying to utilize Meteors abillity to update the client immediately without waiting for a server confirmation. p  pMy goal is that every time an Object is created, the emlistem and the emmain viewem will be instantly updated to reflect the newly added Object. To achieve this I created a Meteor.method, emcreateem, that uses Collection.insert and returns the id so I can use it with my Route. The method is shared across the client and server and is being called from within a strongtemplatesstrong event handler. p  pMy first try was to store the returned id in a variable in the event handler and update the emRouteem in the next line For some reason, that didnt work because the method returned an strongundefinedstrong value. So I tried a different approach, instead of returning the id, I used it within the method to update the emRouteem directly if Meteor.isClient of course. That didnt work either because the id returned by Collection.insert in the clients version of the method was different from the one in the servers version.p  h3First approachh3  precodeTemplate.createDialog.events     click btndialogcreate function event, template          var objectId  Meteor.callcreate         appRouter.navigateobjectid  objectId, triggertrue       codepre  h3Second approachh3  precodeMeteor.methods     create function           var ObjectId  Objects.insertnametest         ifMeteor.isClient             appRouter.navigateobjectid  objectId, triggertrue                codepre  pIf anyone knows whats going on and can give me some directions that would be great.

Negative 5263 pSeveral pharmacy chains in my area have begun offering a hrefhttpwww.envisionamerica.comproductsscripabilityscriptalk relnofollowScripTalka NFC tagged prescriptions to customers that cannot easily read prescription labels due to visual impairments, dyslexia or other reasons. Being visually impaired, technical, and volunteering my time to implement assistive technologies I would like to know if these tags could be read by my newly acquired Galaxy S4. Theres been a few NFC compatability issues with the S4 and with recent Android upgrades, so Im curious if my phone would be able to detect AND read the NFC tags used by Scriptalk. This would indicate how likely smartphones would be to read these tags. I see a lot of use with NFC tags used for assistive tech, and using a phone as a universal NFC reader would be awesome. I have no NFC experience, so Im hoping someone could shed some light on this. Thank youp

So, I added ListBox component on a form, and started to populate it using the code providedp  precode    procedure TPatchNew1.FormShowSender TObject var No, No2 integer begin No20 AdoQuerySearchFixtures.SQL.TextSELECT Manufacturer FROM Fixtures AdoQuerySearchFixtures.Open ManuNoAdoQuerySearchFixtures.RecordCount While No2 lt No do   begin   ManufacturerListbox.Items.Add   AdoQuerySearchFixtures.Close   AdoQuerySearchFixtures.SQL.Clear   AdoQuerySearchFixtures.SQL.TextSELECT Manufacturer FROM Fixtures WHERE IDIntToStrNo21   AdoQuerySearchFixtures.Open   ManufacturerListbox.Items[No2].CaptionAdoQuerySearchFixtures.Fields[0].AsString   No2No21   end  end codepre  pThis does the trick, but Id like it to first merge all duplicates, so that the fixtures with the same Manufacturer field value are all shown only after the Listbox item is clicked I believe Ill be able to do that changing SQL text to WHERE Manufacturersomething, but there are not 100 items in listbox, if I have 90 fixtures from same manufacturer At last, before the listbox is populated, Id like it to be sorted alphabetically, from A to Z. Should I firstly read all manufacturers to sort of a record or array, then find duplicates and delete them, and later sort it, lastly filling in to listbox items, or is there any other way It thats the way, how to do it I give up after this whole day.. p  pThanks.p  pCheers p

Negative 5263 pIm sorry if this question sounds ambiguous but I was asked this in an interview.p  pstrongWrite a program for BFS in a graphtree.strong p  pI wrote the popular code using a queue.p  pNow he asked me to convert it to a DFS code by modifying just one line of the BFS code I had just written.p  pThe only answer I could think of was to use a stack for DFS. Then I implemented the stack using 2 queues.p  pSo in the end my answer was use 1 queue for BFS. for DFS use 2 queues instead.p  pHe did not give me any feedback . Wasnt hired p  pIs my approach fine or is there a better approach  Please help. p

Negative 5263 pI am using knockout.js data binding. At the page load the binding works fine and data is shown on the page correctly. Then I try to push data back to the database and the push is successful. The database receives the data OK. p  pThe problem comes when I try to reload the data upon push success. At this time the binding already happen once at the page load. If I dont bind it again the data on the page does not refresh. If I do the binding again knockout.js issues an error cannot bind multiple times. If I do a cleanup before rebinding I receive an error nodeType undefined.

Theres no such thing as a controller action that returns void. You have specified dataType json so return JSON. Thats it. As far as what parameter this controller action should take, well, from the JSON you are sending NameAA it should be a class that has a Name property of type string.            modify your action signature to look like this [HttpPost] public ActionResult SaveProduct Product product  ... return Jsonnew  success  true  . Or get rid of this dataType json attribute from your AJAX request if you dont want to return JSON. In this case you could return simply status code 201 Created with empty response body return new HttpStatusCodeResult201.

Negative 5263 pThis was asked to me in an interview.p  pIm given a string whose characters come from the set a,b,c only. Find all substrings that dont contain all the characters from the set.For e.g, substrings that contain only as, only bs, only cs or only a,bs or only b,cs or only c,as. I gave him the naive On2 solution by generating all substrings and testing them. p  pThe interviewer wanted an On solution.p  pEdit My attempt was to have the last indexes of a,b,c and run a pointer from left to right, and anytime all 3 were counted, change the start of the substring to exclude the earliest one and start counting again.

Negative 5263 pIm new to D3, but loving it so far. But I know my solutions lack... elegance.p  pI am trying to have 2 controls, a table and a graph displaying the data represented by the cells of the table. If you click on a cell on the table, the associated line should be highlighted. If you hover over a line the associate table cell will change color. Eventually there will be a third control showing detail data specific to that cel. Unfortunately Ive only managed to make this work if I use static calls to the update function. If I try to be clever and dynamic the whole thing breaks.p  pIve tried to minimize my example as much as I can below. The click tableupdate line works because the calls to SelectData that updates everything uses constant data. However the mouseover on the lines doesnt work. Eventually I need the table to be more dynamic too, but for now, how do I fix thisp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt ltmeta charsetutf8gt ltstylegt     .lineDefault          fill none         stroke red         strokewidth 1.5px         strokedasharray 4,4          .axis path,     .axis line          fill none         stroke 000         shaperendering crispEdges      ltstylegt ltbodygt     ltdiv idwrapgt         lttablegt             lttrgt                 lttd iddataBlock onclickSelectData0gt1lttdgt                 lttd iddataBlock onclickSelectData1gt2lttdgt             lttrgt             lttrgt                 lttd iddataBlock onclickSelectData2gt3lttdgt                 lttd iddataBlock onclickSelectData3gt4lttdgt             lttrgt         lttablegt         ltdivgt             ltsvg classchartgtltsvggt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltscript srchttpd3js.orgd3.v3.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscriptgt     var width  600, height  600     var maxx  100,         maxy  100      var linedata       linedata[0]  [[0, 50 ],[ 50, 60 ],[100, 100]]     linedata[1]  [[0, 40 ],[ 40, 40 ],[100, 90 ]]     linedata[2]  [[0, 20 ],[ 50, 30 ],[100, 90 ]]     linedata[3]  [[0, 0  ],[ 60, 30 ],[100, 30 ]]     var activeElement  0     var graphlines       var numlines  0      chart  d3.select.chart.attrviewBox, 0 0 600 600.appendg      var x  d3.scale.linear.domain[0, maxx].range[0, width]      var y  d3.scale.linear.domain[0, maxy].range[height, 0]      var xAxis  d3.svg.axis.scalex.orientbottom      var yAxis  d3.svg.axis.scaley.orientleft      var line  d3.svg.line         .xfunctiond  return xd[0]          .yfunctiond  return yd[1]       for var i  0 i lt 4 i          graphlines[i]  chart             .appendpath             .datumlinedata[i]             .attrclass, lineDefault             .attrid, linedata             .attrd, line             .onmouseover, SelectDatai         numlines           function SelectDatan          d3.selectAlltd.transition             .stylebackgroundcolor, functiond, i                  return i  n  c99  fff                      activeElement  n         for var i  0 iltnumlines i              if i  n                  graphlines[i]                     .stylestrokedasharray, 1,0                     .transition                     .stylestrokewidth, 3                     .stylestroke, steelblue              else                  graphlines[i]                     .stylestrokedasharray, 4,4                     .transition                     .stylestrokewidth, 1.5                     .stylestroke, red                             ltscriptgt codepre  pThe mouseclick on the table effects the lines, the mouseover on the lines does not effect the table.

More specificallyp  ol liAm I correct in my understanding that with 1.6.4 or later I will need to leverage TinkerPop Blueprints in order to build a graph databaseli liIf so, am I obliged to use Gremlin or is the extended SQL provided by OrientDB still available to me li liShould I, ideally, be creating the initial nonembedded database programatically through the TinkerPop APIs or establishing the structure via OrientDBs native console li liDoes a blueprints implementation preclude me from using clusters or classes can I still use the inheritance structure built into OrientDBli liGiven that I wont be using an embedded database, is Rexster obligatory for a TinkerPopbased implementationli liHas anyone heard wind of a Rexster kibble to provide Cypher support Dli ol  pThe majority of my experience to date has been with MS SQL and Neo4J as is likely implied by my questions.p  pCheers,p  pJonp

Negative 5263 pI have few codeArrayListltTgtcode containing user defined objects e.g. codeListltStudentgt, ListltTeachersgtcode. The objects are immutable in nature, i.e. no setters are provided  and also, due to the nature of the problem, no one will ever attempt to modify these objects. Once the ArrayList is populated, no further additionremoval of objects is allowedpossible. So List will not dynamically change.p  pWith such given condition, can this data structures i.e. codeArraListcode be safely used by strongmultiple threadsstrong simultaneously Each of the thread will just read the objectproperties, but there is no set operation possible.p  pSo, my question is can I rely on codeArrayListcode If not, what other less expensive data structures can be used in such scenariop
Negative 5263 pIm new Azure developer. My scenario is something like manager will publish new topicqueue by websitewp8 and worker should get notification by push notification in wp8 about newly added topicqueue. At this moment I have all the pieces ready such as topicqueue creation, sending receiving. But it works on pulling basis. Meaning manager can crate topic and publish message. Then worker has to subscribe to the topic for receiving message and pull every time to check is there anything new.p  pSo I want to make this system based on notification. I meant whenever anything newly added in topic user should get a notification by push notification. So can you suggest me how can I achieve this goal Is there any event generates from service bus if topic added or removed, etc Thanks in advancep

Negative 5263 pI am currently working on an android application that evaluate images in different aspects, and I found that there are lots great open source algorithms can be used.p  pProblem 1 Most of the algorithms are designed on ccmatlab languages that cannot be applied directly. Ive search that NDK is a tool that allows us develop android application by other languages, but the setup procedures are quite complicated that I stuck for days. So before I go further on it, I would like to first ask whether I can include others cc source code directly like calling java libraryp  pProblem 2 For example, I would like to use a hrefhttpwww.umiacs.umd.eduzhengyfPointMatching.htm relnofollow titlePoint MatchingPoint Matchinga algorithms a hrefhttpwww.umiacs.umd.eduzhengyfPointMatchDemoPointMatchSourceCode.zip relnofollowsource codea in my application, but there are lots files inside as its just source code but not libraryplugin. What are the steps to apply the require functions in my android application the most desired way is to blindly input some images to the alogrithm, and it returns the results like calling functions, which I dont have to understand the working principle of it.p

Negative 5263 pIm looking to convert Sharepoint TimeZone information into a Java TimeZone object for use with my application which is using the Sharepoint REST API.  I understand that Sharepoint stores all its timestamps in UTC but, when using the REST API, some of the timestamps are returned time zone adjusted and some are not.  The format is the same for both except, as you would expect, the UTC values end with a Z and the time zone adjusted values do not.  So, its easy enough to convert those to Java DateTime objects but if I want to consistently return UTC values to my callers, I will have to adjust the nonZ values to UTC.  Sharepoint allows me to get the configured TimeZone information for the Sharepoint server but what I need is a mapping from that information to the Java TimeZone ids.  What Sharepoint provides through REST looks like thisp  pDescription GMT0700 Mountain Time US and Canada Bias 420 Daylight Bias 60 Standard Bias 0p  pIt doesnt provide any information that might indicate, say, when DST starts etc. but I figured I wouldnt need to worry about that as long as I can map the Sharepoint Description to a Java TimeZone id.  So, Im hoping that someone has run into this need before or perhaps has some other suggestion as to how I might get the UTC values I need from Sharepoints REST API.p

In the schema, for a given friendship from ID 123 to ID 456 this is stored as two tuples 123, 456 and 456, 123.p  pIt seems to me that to store a single conceptual entity in two tuples is not good the data can potentially become inconsistent and theres duplication in the dataset.p  pUnless Im mistaken, it should be possible to do everything we want to do with the database, even if theres only one tuple.

Negative 5263 pI have a Gulp concat watch task setup to concat some JS filesp  precodevar sources  [   publicjsscriptA.js,   publicjsscriptB.js,   publicjsscriptC.js,   publicjsscriptD.js,   publicjsscriptE.js ]  gulp.taskmain.js, function     return gulp.srcsources         .pipeconcatmain.js         .pipegulp.dest.publicjs   gulp.taskwatch, function      gulp.watchsources, [main.js]  codepre  pPretty normal setup I think. Whenever any of the scripts change, the codemain.jscode is created by concatenating the scripts in that order. It works fine 99 of the time.p  pBut sometimes, maybe randomly, the concat simply leaves out 1 or more of the files. Ill be editing codescriptB.jscode for example, save it, then look at codemain.jscode and it concated only codescriptAcode, codescriptBcode and codescriptEcode. It completely left out C and D. And sometimes it might just be C. Sometimes it might be D. Sometimes it might be A. Its just random. I didnt do anything to any of the files it leaves out. I have it opened in my editor but its unchanged and just sitting there. Gulp just decides to leave it out for some random reason sometimes.p  pThe way I fix it is to simply open up whatever script was left out and add a space to the end of a random line or something and then save it, then the codemain.jscode is concatenated like Id expect it. There was nothing wrong with the file. Just had to resave it.p  pIs this an outstanding bug to anyones knowledge I havent been able to find any of info on this bug anywhere. Is there anything I can do to debug or log this issue to figure out how to recreate itp  pOne thing I did notice, was, lets say I was editing codescriptCcode and save it, and then notice codescriptDcode was missing. If I go back to codescriptCcode and save it again, codescriptDcode is still not concatenated in. I HAVE to open up codescriptDcode and save it to force it to be included back into the codemain.jscode. So once I see the problem popup, I can typically recreate it in this manner.p  pThis typically only happens about 1 in 20 saves.p

Negative 5263 pI have an OpenGL 1.1 ES 2D sprite engine thats based on one GLTRIANGLEFAN per sprite.  The main rendering code that gets called persprite, perframe is as followsp  precodevoid drawTextureBitmapImage aImage, short vertices, float texCoords,             ColorMap ampcolorMap, TInt xDest, TInt yDest, TInt aAlpha      glPushMatrix     glLoadIdentity      glBindTextureGLTEXTURE2D, textureId     glVertexPointer3, GLSHORT, 0, vertices     glTexCoordPointer2, GLFLOAT, 0, texCoords     glColorPointerRGBABYTES, GLUNSIGNEDBYTE, 0, colorMap.GetMap      TFloat scaleX, scaleY     aImagegtgetScalescaleX, scaleY     glTranslateffloatxDest, floatyDest, 0.0f     glScalefscaleX, scaleY, 1.0f     glRotatefaImagegtgetRotAngle, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f      glDrawArraysGLTRIANGLEFAN, 0, 4     glPopMatrix  codepre  pIve been told that switching to Vertex Buffer Objects VBOs will significantly increase the performance of rendering, so Id like to do that. My research thus far has lead me to several examples showing how to set up individual vertex, color, and texture offset buffers, but good examples of how to interleave this data have been more elusive.p  pFor example, Im pretty sure this is how Id set up to render with my vertex data in a VBOp  precodeglGenBuffers1, ampbatchBufferHandle glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, batchBufferHandle glBufferDataGLARRAYBUFFER, dataSize, data, GLSTATICDRAW glVertextPointer3, GLSHORT, 0, 0 glDrawElements..., 0 glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, 0 glDeleteBuffers1, ampbatchBufferHandle codepre  pApparently Id generate and bind similar buffers for texture coordinates and vertex color data, though Im not 100 clear on how setting those up would differ.p  pMy understanding is that the speed boost would come from rendering a bunch of these triangle fans in one draw call, but what is a draw call in this context  DrawElements gets called multiple times using this methodology, so that cant be it...p  pWhatever the case, it would mean that Id have to generate a VBO or three that contain all the data in series for a bunch of sprites. That can be difficult enough on its own given the legacy code Im dealing with, but I also need to translate, scale, and rotate each individual sprite.  Where does that data go in the VBOsp  pMy conclusion thus far is using VBOs is only helpful in the case of a SINGLE, but complex object. It would appear what I want to do is not possible  provide OpenGL with a list of sprites to render including all vertex, color, texture map, scale, rotation, and translation information for each.p  pIs my assessment correct or is there a way to do this using OpenGL ES 1.1p

Negative 5263 pI am wondering if it is possible to have a dynamic enumeration.p  pstrongExplanationstrong I have a function to add errors to an error log in ms access. The categories in my Enum variable are all in a table. If I use the function and enum as depicted below, it works just fine. The problem is however, that there is a possibility that the categories will change with time.p  precodeEnum category     Category1  1     Category2  2     etc...     n End Enum  Public Function AddErrorCurrentorderID As Long, Optional ErrorCategory As category Add the error to the log End Function codepre  pI have noticed that using DLookups and recordsets and actually everything in general will not work. While compiling, it throws an Invalid inside Enum. Consulting MSDN gives me the following information emYou tried to specify a string or some other invalid type as the value of an Enum member. The constant expression used to specify an Enum member must evaluate to type Long or another Enum type.em p  pThis tells me that an enum can hold only long types, hence the numbers, but also other Enum types. p  pemWhat I am looking forem Is there some workaround, or method, to loop through a recordset or query and pass the values on to an array, and dynamically assign these values to an enumeration. Or perhaps it can be done by changing the source codevba text itselfp  pstrongNotestrong I know that there are a lot of other ways to add my errors to a log and I am able to do so, but for know I am just wondering if this is even possible to do.p  pI am looking forward to your reactions.p

Negative 5263 pMy iOS app requires socket communication. Im following a hrefhttpwww.raywenderlich.com3932networkingtutorialforioshowtocreateasocketbasediphoneappandserver relnofollowthisa Ray Wenderlich tutorial for setting up the input and output streams. The server Im using is Twisted. My app requires sending and receiving fast bursts of data generated by external events like gyroscope data. It is sendingreceiving data in form of JSON string. So largely, its very much like a realtime messaging chat app but sending and receiving is very fast and in bursts. p  pSo my app layout is that I have 1 view controller codeDViewContorllercode and a tabbarcontroller with 3 tableviewcontrollers. I need to send and receive data in all these 4 view controllers, hence I implemented the socket stream initialization in App Delegate. For all the 3 tabs, my App Delegate sets the code[self.inputstream setDelegateself]code but when it is in the codeDViewControllercode it sets the delegate of input stream to a reference of codeDViewControllercode. In codevoidviewWillDisappearcode of codeDViewControllercode, I reset the input stream delegate to a reference of AppDelegate to let it regain the control over the inputstream. For outputstream, the delegate is always set to AppDelegate and never changed.p  pBoth my codeAppDelegatecode and codeDViewControllercode are codeltNSStreamDelegategtcode and both implementp  precode voidstreamNSStream theStream handleEventNSStreamEventstreamEvent   codepre  pwith all the stream event cases implemented. p  pSo basically, my entire setup works well, but only if data is not fastor for that matter, I cannot seem to pinpoint the exact problem.p  pSo here are a few observations which I have made while testing with a SimulatoriPhone and iPhoneiPhone setupp  pA. SIMULATOR  iPHONEp  ol lipNow in this setup, I am able to send data fast and exactly the way I want it to send from Simulator to iPhone, but not from iPhone to Simulator. The iPhone receives all the strings well and acts as per required.pli lipSending from iPhone to Simulator, simulator can read data only one JSON string at a time, and doesnt work when data is sent fast. If sent fast, then all strings received by the simulator are halfonly one half is received. NOTE The server receives and sends full strings, and all the strings even if it is fast, there is no problem with the server.pli lipIf I send data simultaneously, at the same time, from both the Simulator and iPhone, even if fast, both receive and process all the strings well.pli ol  pB. iPHONE  iPHONEp  ol lipEither iPhones any one of them sending, not both together can receive data only one JSON string at a time, and both dont work when data is sent fast. If sent fast, then all strings received by the any of the iPhones are halfonly one half is received. NOTE The server receives and sends full strings, and all the strings even if it is fast, there is no problem with the server.pli lipIf I send data simultaneously, at the same time, from both the iPhones to each other, even if fast, both receive and process all the strings well.pli ol  pThese observations led me to believe that the iPhone is receiving all fast strings only if it is simultaneously sending something to the server. OR i could be totally wrong, because when the Simulator sends to iPhone, the iPhone is able to receive everything no matter what. I want to know what the simulator is doing differently that the string received from it is taken in as full by the iPhone but not the other way round. Is it that the iPhone sends way too fast than a Simulator, hence all its sent strings dont get registered by the receiver Somebody help me crack this pleasep  pNOTE In all cases, the server works perfectly and it sends and receives data in full length, no matter whatever speed. And Im using iOS 7. p  pstrongUPDATE 1strong Okay, so been experimenting with it the entire day, I finally made it to work. The thing is, it is exactly what my question statement is, output stream cannot stay idle if you want to receive continuously and fast from the input stream. I dont know why that happens, if anyone could enlighten me please. So the quickfix Im using is that whenever I get bytes on input stream, I immediately send blank data to server to keep the output stream active. So now the input stream can read complete data and fast. But I feel it is a wastage of server resources. Plus its not a reliable solution. Im looking for a concrete solution. I want to know how the Simulator does it without being bothered about the utilization of output stream. Can anyone help pleasep  pstrongUPDATE 2strong Learning from the previous update, its not about sending blank data to the server, but i need to send dummy data to the strongsenderstrong if i want to receive the next string from him complete. I need to keep the endtoend communication alive with dummyblank data if i want to endreceive data fast and complete. Anyone has had this issue and found a better reliableconcrete way to do it p

Negative 5263 pI have encountered an unexpected behavior of JS codesetTimeoutcode when modal dialog windows like codealertcode are open and I would like to know the reason behind it.p  pI expected setTimeoutfn,10000 to mean check current time periodically and when it is greater than Now  10000ms fire the event handler that will invoke the passed fn function. This would be logical, seeing how we pass the timeout measure as ms from now. But, apparently, the countdown on codesetTimeoutcode is a literal countdown and  will be paused while a modal window is open.p  precodesetTimeoutfunction     alert A     alert10 seconds have passed for the first setTimeout , 10000 setTimeoutfunction     alert B     alertWait for 15 seconds and press OK ,1000 codepre  pI would expect alert A to display immediately after you close alert B presuming you waited for 15 sec. to do so, since alert A timeout was just for 10 sec and they have already passed. Practice, however, shows that countdown to alert A is simply paused while alert B is open and it will show only after approx. 9 more seconds have passed after youve closed alert B, no matter how long B was open.p  pThis does not seem logical. p  pstrongUpdate.strong Im definitely not the only one confused here, because this behavior of pausing the timeout occurs in Chrome and Internet Explorer, but not Firefox. Firefox executes the behavior I expected  if you wait for 15 seconds on alert B  alert A pops out instantly whenever you close it.  p

Negative 5263 pI am trying to develop a proof of concept for Vert.x  a simple realtime browser game. p  pLets imagine a game similar to online poker  you have a lobby with a number of existing games that you can join. You can also create a new game so the number of games in that lobby is variable.  In front of that, you have an asynchronous http server cluster which players connect to. Especially once in a particular game, everything is real time, so when a player performs some action, others see it immediately without refresh or regular ajax polling.p  pI was thinking about how to break this functionality into verticles. My first thought is to create a verticle to handle http connections and to set up the http server to expose selected events on the eventbus to http clients, another verticle to represent the game lobby and third verticle to represent an actual game. The lobby and game verticles would only know about the event bus, they would not handle http at all.p  pThe only thing that is not clear to me, is the scope of these verticles, especially the game verticle, because there will be more dynamic number of games.  By default, you deploy fixed number of particular verticle instances in simple apps, that is often only one. In this scenario, this one verticle would have to listen on the eventbus for games events, decide which game does this event belong to, deserialize the games state, change it, serialize it and store it again. Then notify all connected players.p  pWhat I would like to do instead, is to have a verticlepergameinstance scope. By this I mean, when a new game is created in the lobby, the lobby verticle would start a new instance of the game verticle, pass it somehow a new game ID so it could bind to events only for that game ID and this game verticle would store the state for that particular game inmemory, in its instance variables. When the game finishes, the verticle would instruct connected browsers to return to lobby and destroy itself.p  pIs my way of imagining this correct If so, what is the best way of achieving this Especially the part about dynamically creating and destroying verticle instances, with passing some information ID, etc... to a newly created verticlep  pA bonus question  how can I restrict that the player can only listen to and send events from a game he belongs to So that he does not influence other games. Basically similar thing you would do with sessionsaccess management in traditional Java ServletEE application.p

Negative 5263 pI am hoping that someone can help me with a new issue that I am experiencing in WordPress 4.1. p  pI have been using custom images for quite a while on my website. and it always worked 100p  pThese custom images gets created in my functions.php file, and all images gets resized from 1920px to 150px, 240px, 300px, 468px, 540px, 677px, 720px, 750 and 1920px. These are then served to mobile devices, tablets or desktops depending on the resolutions needed.p  pThe problem that I have is that previously the script would pick the correct Height of each image as wordpress saved it into the db and on the disk itself.p  ul liimage150x150.jpgli liimage240x159.jpgli liimage300x199.jpg li liimage468x311.jpgli liimage540x359.jpgli liimage677x450.jpgli liimage720x479.jpgli liimage750x499.jpgli ul  pThe original file that I upload is always 1920px width irrespective of the height of the image. In the above case the image width is 1920px and the height is 1279pxp  pTo calculate the dimensions for the smaller images I use the following formulap  ul lioriginal height  original width x new width  new height li ul  pThis will give me the height of all smaller imagesp  ul li240x159.875px and wordpress would save it as 159px heightli li300x199.8438px and wordpress would save it as 199px heightli li468x311.7563px and wordpress would save it as 311px heightli li540x359.7188px and wordpress would save it as 359px heightli li677x450.9807px and wordpress would save it as 450px heightli li720x479.625px and wordpress would save it as 479px heightli li750x499.6094px and wordpress would save it as 499px heightli ul  pI am not sure how wordpress handled the image dimensions previously, but now in the script where I am using the formula original height  original width x new width  new height the values are not the same as what wordpress would save in the db and on the disk.p  peg an image with dimensions 1920px x 1518px will create the following files on the hard diskp  ul liimg240x190.jpg and the height not rounded 189.75pxli liimg300x237.jpg and the height not rounded 237.1875pxli liimg468x370.jpg and the height not rounded 370.0125pxli liimg540x427.jpg and the height not rounded 426.9375pxli liimg677x535.jpg and the height not rounded 535.253125pxli liimg720x569.jpg and the height not rounded 569.25pxli liimg750x593.jpg and the height not rounded 592.96875pxli ul  pNow if I place a round php code inside my script I am able to get eg the image file like img750x593.jpg on the front end to look for the image 750x593.jpg and find it.p  pHowever 100s of previously uploaded images seems to break when I use round I suspect that in WordPress 4.1 the image rounding is working differently than in previous versions, and I cannot figure out how to accommodate the new image upload round function to be backwards compatible with my previously uploaded images, without breaking them...p  pIf I am correct, in previous wordpress versions the images were rounded up or down, differently than to how the latest WP4.1 is rounding up or down images.p  pFrom what I am guessing in previous word press versions if a file had the size of 1920px x 1518px wordpress would have saved the height for a scaled image of 750px at 750px x 592px 592.96875px without rounding up the image to 750px x 593px and now it looks like wordpress is saving the file at 750px x 593px and not as 750px at 592px, which results in a if I fix the roundup to accommodate the new upload images roundup feature then all the old images breaks, and if I fix it for the old ones new uploaded images might not display correctly if they need to be round up... p

The weird thing is that when I click the edit codebuttoncode for the second time after 1st debug, items in dropdownlist are selected correctly. p  pI have used the followingp  blockquote   pddlCarriedItems.SelectedValue  SValuep blockquote  pThough SValue has values of itemlist, SelectedValue displays none. p  pHeres the code.p  precodeprotected void btnEditClickobject sender, EventArgs e              try                      Button btn  Buttonsender             GridViewRow gv  GridViewRowbtn.NamingContainer             string VRMid  gv.Cells[0].Text                             dc.Companycode  Convert.ToInt32Session[companycode].ToString             dc.Vrmid  Convert.ToInt32VRMid                            DataTable dtVRMCP  vrmbll.editVRMcarriedproductsdc             int rowIndex  0             if dtVRMCP.Rows.Count gt 0                              for int i  0 i lt dtVRMCP.Rows.Count i                                                              DropDownList ddlItemsType  DropDownListgvCarriedItems.Rows[rowIndex].Cells[1].FindControlddlItemsType                     DropDownList ddlCarriedItems  DropDownListgvCarriedItems.Rows[rowIndex].Cells[2].FindControlddlCarriedItems                     TextBox txtItemPrice  TextBoxgvCarriedItems.Rows[rowIndex].Cells[3].FindControltxtItemPrice                     TextBox txtItemQty  TextBoxgvCarriedItems.Rows[rowIndex].Cells[4].FindControltxtItemQty                     TextBox txtItemTotal  TextBoxgvCarriedItems.Rows[rowIndex].Cells[5].FindControltxtItemTotal                      ddlItemsType.SelectedIndex  Convert.ToInt32dtVRMCP.Rows[i][itemstype].ToString                     int itemstype  ddlItemsType.SelectedIndex                     string SValue  dtVRMCP.Rows[i][items].ToString                                             if itemstype  1                                                                          ddlCarriedItems.SelectedValue SValue                                                                         else if itemstype  2                                                                          ddlCarriedItems.SelectedValue  SValue                                                                      else if itemstype  3                                              ddlCarriedItems.SelectedValue  SValue                                                                      else                                           txtItemPrice.Text  dtVRMCP.Rows[i][itemsprice].ToString                     txtItemQty.Text  dtVRMCP.Rows[i][itemsqty].ToString                     txtItemTotal.Text  dtVRMCP.Rows[i][itemstotal].ToString                     if i  dtVRMCP.Rows.Count  1 ampamp gvCarriedItems.Rows.Count  dtVRMCP.Rows.Count                                              AddNewRow                                                                  rowIndex                                                catch                 codepre
Negative 5263 pIn VS2013 I have created a small sample application that uses the nuget package p  ul licodeEntityFramework.SqlServerCompactcodeli ul  pBesides the Entity Framework this package adds the native DLLs of SQL Server Compact 4.0 for private deployment somewhere under the hidden packages folder of the VSproject.p  pWhen I compile the project these native DLLs are magically copied to binDebug into x86 and amd64 folders. The application finds them there and runs just fine.p  pHowever, when I want to publish my project as ClickOnce there is a problemp  ul liThe native DLLs do not show up under Publish  Application Filesli liNormally files can be added to Application Files by setting the Build Action to Content.

Negative 5263 pReceived my Jetson TK1 yesterday. After unboxing it and configuring the Linux GUI, rebooting the device with a mouse cordless attached to its USB 3.0 port takes it to some sort of Command line page where it probably loads some files and then the screen starts printing  [ . ] . Nothing happens beyond that until I restart the board without any USB peripheral and then the device boots into the normal Linux GUI. Unable to figure out whats wrong with my board and why is it not working properly.I am a newbie to LINUXp  pP.S. Connecting the monitor via HDMI after switching on the device gives no visual output, just a blank screen. Is it possible to connect the device via network adapter for remote access even it the screen is running blankp
Negative 5263 pSo I got a problem with Arrays in a C code. I think the problem is nothing serious, but after working over 48 hours on my code I just cant really see through. So heres my problem I got a function called path, which finds the shortest path between two given point in a maze. The function returns an int variable, I named stepcount. Here I store the number of steps needed from one Point to the other. This information is stored in an array called comb. This array is two dimensional.p  precodeagents  atoi argv[4]  int k0 unsigned int num  agentsagents unsigned int comb[num][3]Represents steps form one agent to the target gt [][1]  Startpoint [][2]  Endpoint [][3]  number of steps unsigned int distance[agents][3]  forint i0 iltagents i      forint j0 jltagents j              stepcountpathnodeAgents[i], nodeTargets[j]         comb[k][0]i         comb[k][1]j         comb[k][2]stepcount         k        forint i0 iltnum i      printfd. Steps from Agent d to Target needed d dn,i, comb[i][0],comb[i][1],comb[i][2]  codepre  pSo I get the number of steps needed from the position of an agent to all targets in the maze. Now I want to find the nearest target to the agent. Therefore I programmed this codep  precodeforint i0 iltnum iagents      forint jk jltagents j              ifcomb[ji][2]ltcomb[ji1][2]                      distance[j][0]  i             distance[j][1]  j             distance[j][2]  comb[ji][2]                 forint i0 iltagents i      int j  distance[i][0]     int x  distance[i][1]     int y  distance[i][2]     printfd. Nearest Target to Agent d is Target d. The number of steps needed is dn, i, j, x, y  codepre  pBut something must be wrong in this segment of my code, because the program stops there. So currently I just cant figure out what I forgot, or did wrong. So I hope maybe someone, can give me a hint, before I go nuts.p

Nothing is displayed when the date is empty. The only thing is that with this formatter I loose my connection to the odata model. This means that whenever I make a change to the value, it does not reflect in the odata model and thus I cannot save this date. The same holds true when I set a value for the first time, when the control is still empty.p  pDoes anybody know how to fix this Id rather not look at other options as hiding the field.p

Negative 5263 pI have an opensource VCVS2010 project base which I am testing for the last few days. I can hook using a hrefhttpresearch.microsoft.comenusprojectsdetours relnofollowDetoursa a DirectX9 Game on the server, then send off the captured screen buffer to the client. The client views the game as a video.  As you may know Cloud Gaming is the norm. But I have stumbled into a serious issue. When I am playing the game at the client, all is ok, all events captured at the client mousekb are sent back to the server and the server replays them, fine  I can see from the logs that events are correctly reaching the server. but as soon as the game window is minimized at the server, all goes crazy. The logs show me the mouse and KB events are reaching the server, but since them game window is minimized, the game is not reacting to my clicks. Putting it simplep  p1 Server is a dll that Hooks into the Game exe. 2 Once hooked, client can connect to the server, client events are relayed to the server, server sends the events down into the game. Game play fine 3 When I minimized the game window  whatever I do the game wont react. I still see the game window visible on the client end. p  pDoes this mean Windows7 64bit is basically EATING away the events before they the server can relay them to the game Or just because the game is minimized, the mouse and kb events have been taken over by windows while the server is accepting the events.p  pSendInput... Windos API function is called to replay events at the Server which is basically sending the events to the hooked game window SetWindowsHookEx when it receives the client input from the network. p

Negative 5263 pI stumbled upon an unexplained behaviour by matplotlib. If I plot an image using imshow, add quiver plot and an ellipse the quiver plot arrow angle gets corrupted. See sample code below. Executing it makes ellipse and quiver arrow point to different directions even though the angles for both are the same. This happens only when an image is pained with imshow. After a day of debugging I found that setting ylim solves the problem. You can run the code and then uncomment two last lines and run it again.  I upgraded matplotlib to the latest version the issue is still there.

Negative 5263 pI recently adopted datatables on my site and I have created a page that receives a PHP array of ID numbers from one table and then uses them to create a new table. Basically allows the user to select results from one table they wish to compare against eachother and displays the selected fields in a new table on a page called compareSelected.php. My issue here is that I receive the following errorp  pcodeUncaught TypeError Cannot read property length of undefined jquery.datatables.min.js21code in the chrome console and it causes my datatables plugin to fail on initialization.

Negative 5263 pI have a listbox with about 5 items  emblankem 1 2 3 4 5p  ponly one displayed on the GUI scroll at a time   and user has to scroll to others and based on the value selected I have to do a search . I am keeping the first item in the Collection property as emblankem since by default the first item in a listbox is Selected. Hence if the user doesnt select anything , it will do a search on emblankem and my regex will return ALL if the search is done on emblankem.p  pHowever , if the user selects one of the other entries , say 3 and then scrolls to another item , the new item is not registered unless the user clicks on it in the listbox .p  pI want the selection to be done on scroll .p  p1Is there a better way to design this use case by using a different control p  p2 Can selection on scroll be done through properties as opposed to writing some piece of code on some Event handler like say scrolledp

Negative 5263 pI have 6 Android apps in production, available at the Google Store, which apparently emallem fail on Nexus tablets running Android 5.x variants.  All my current tablets are Android Kitkat 4.4.2 or earlier, so for now, I cannot even run a logcat from adb to see what is happening.  Users are reporting none of my apps run on Android 5.0.1 and 5.0.2, and I confirmed it today, with a Nexus 9, at a carriers retail outlet.  My code uses java and JNI the native interface.  Java stuff starts ok, but JNI fails.  It looks like others have this problem.  Is there any obvious and elegant way to restore Android 4.4 Kitkat operational functionality within the unstablealtered Android 5.0lollipop   Specifically  I need to emdisableem the checkJNI feature, which is a Dalvik VM feature.  This is done by having a low Android API number in the AndroidManifest.xml file.  I use Android8 API, but code is built using Android19 API, and apps work on all 4.x series tabletsphones.  Can I disable checkJNI in ARTLollipop explicitly, as is possible implicitly using DalvikKitcat  Or am I barking up the wrong tree   Based on the number of reports of brokenfailing apps on Android 5.x, there are clearly significant issues. The current workaround seems to be a direct downgrade back to Android 4.4.x. But if there are some specific showstopping issues such as I am apparently dealing with... re. JNI code migration from Kitkat to Lollipop, a short comment would be most appreciated.  Thanx.p

Negative 5263 pI have a data problem I need to clean up. Basically I have two tables storing package information, one table for documents and one table for audit information. I have entries in the package tables that reference documents that no longer exist and have been replaced same name but different id and I want to write a query to find all the bad ones and which new document should replace them. The only thing linking these two is a string value in the audit table which stores the document name not id.p  pIve setup a sample schema here a hrefhttpsqlfiddle.com4997bda1 relnofollowhttpsqlfiddle.com4997bda1ap  ul lipackages is the single values for a package in our applicationli lipackager is the repeating values for a package in our application ul lithese are joined with the same value in the id columnli ulli liauditinfo is all the audit information in a packageli lidocs is all the documents that can be attached to a packageli ul  pThis query finds the packages with bad attachments may be more than one per packagep  precodeselect distinct ps.pkgname, pr.doclist from packages ps, packager pr where ps.id  pr.id and not exists    select 1 from docs   where pr.doclist  id    order by 1,2 asc  codepre  pI need to build a query with the following rulesp  ul liI need to return at least the package id, the position value and the new document id I will build an update statement to put this new document id in the row matching the package id  position in the packager tableli lithe way to get the document name from the audit information is SUBSTRdescription,0,INSTRdescription,[2li liIf the document was Added and then Removed, it should be ignored string1li listring2 must not be Supportingli lithe new document must match state  Master latest  1 pub  0li ul  pRight now I have a semiworking script that works on a per package basis, but the problem is affecting 2000 packages. I find the audit entries that dont match documents correctly attached to the package and then search for those names in the document table. The problem with this is since there is no direct link between the package and document tables, if there are multiple problem attachments on one package, each new document is returned once per position value, i.e.p  precodepackage id      bad doc id      position      new doc id p1              d1              1            d1new p1              d1              1            d4new p1              d4              2            d1new p1              d4              2            d4new codepre  pIt doesnt matter which new id goes into which position value, but the duplication result problem like this makes it hard to mass generate update scripts, some manual filtering would be required.p  pThis is a somewhat complex and unique data issue, so any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 5263 pThe company that I work for has two active directories strongad1.comstrong, strongad2.comstrong because it has two different stores that had nothing to do with each other and plenty of users but now the managers of both stores need a page in common. So I need to create a login where the users could access using just their Active Directory username and password.p  pIn the login page there should be a list to choose the active directory and after that the user strongPaulstrongpaulstrongad1strong.com and the user strongPaulstrongpaulstrongad2strong.com with their respective password should be able to access to the page.p  pI have the code needed for the logIn page for one AD and works great but I dont know if its possible to make the page available for two ADs.

Negative 5263 pI am fighting a rather pesky and illusive bug in my app. I am storing a long random string   3200 characters  in the iOS keychain using the Keychain wrapper a hrefhttpsgithub.comkharrisonUYLPasswordManager relnofollowUYLPasswordManagera. After what seems like a completely random period of time, that value stored in the Keychain returns as a string of date rather than the long string that was originally stored.p  pNow, I say that it returns a string of a date instead of the long string, however it could very well be returning any number of strings that are not correct  I was only able to reproduce it once with debugging to see the erroneous value coming back from the Keychain. p  pThings I have triedp  ol liA multitude of Keychain wrappers, each of which exhibits the issue eventually.li liCombing through each character of code that writes to the Keychain to ensure the value is not being overwritten.li ol  pBeyond that, due to the illusive nature of the bug, I have not been able to attack it from a different angle because I have no idea where else to look. I am storing other strings in the Keychain that are much shorter which never seem to have a problem. Is there a known issue or anyone else with a similar experience with storing long strings in the Keychainp  pI am using Swift 1.2 the problem predates v1.2 and the latest Xcode stable.p  pstrongEDITstrong I am attempting to split the string into smaller chunks and save those each in the keychain to see if there is corruption or loss of that data over time. I will post back here with results.p  pstrongEDITstrong Ever since I split up the string into many small parts, I have not seen the issue. I am going to wait another week before I confirm the issue as resolved using this method. Also, I plan on filing a bug report to Apple.p
Negative 5263 pI stumbled over an odd behaviour while developing an application on Lotus Notes for a customer. So I wondered if anyone has an idea why this happens and if theres a workaround or something to be aware of while developing, so this does not happen. Thanks for any IdeasInfos in advance.p  hr  pstrongProblemstrongp  pI have a Document lets call it the MainDoc open in UiDoc with 2 embedded views. Since its in EditMode, the document is locked. On the first embedded view theres a button that makes a copy of a document thats selected in this embedded view. Once saved, that copydocument will appear in the second embedded view. When the Copy is made, its not saved, but opened in another UiDoc in a new Tab, so that the user then can save it. This Document has an Attachment in a Richtext, which was also copied from the other Document. Now once this Attachment is opened before saving the Document and closing and reopening it in the UiDoc the Lock on the MainDoc gets lost, enabling other users to Edit it without getting any warnings, that the document is locked by another user. This happens even though the MainDoc is still open and in EditMode.p  hr  pstrongAdditional infosstrongp  pThe Flag Allow document locking on the DatabaseProperties is not checked, but the Users still get a message that the document is locked and are prevented from editing it. If it is checked, the User cant open the Attachment as long as the NotesDocument holding it isnt saved. Since the Database is only on one Server I assume that the Flag isnt needed. Edit SoftLocking is enabledp  pManually locking the Document is out of question, mainly because theres not enough manpower.p  hr  pstrongCodestrongp  precodeSub createCopyDocdoc As NotesDocument      On Error GoTo ProcessError      Dim session As New NotesSession     Dim ws As New NotesUIWorkspace     Dim db As NotesDatabase      Dim docNew As NotesDocument     Dim rtItem As NotesRichTextItem     Dim item As NotesItem      Set db  session.CurrentDatabase     Set docNew  db.CreateDocument      Set rtItem  doc.GetFirstItemmBody get the Item to copy     Call docNew.CopyItemrtItem,         copy the Item to the new document      Call docNew.ReplaceItemValueForm,frmCopy      Copy all the other needed Fields here      Call ws.EditDocumentTrue, docNew      Exit Sub  ProcessError     ProcessError  End Sub codepre

Negative 5263 pSo I am having a problem with my code. I want to pass a value from my array of pointers to a function so the original object is not disturbed my code works perfectly fine if I pass the reference I just am just trying to do it a different way as a learning exercise. After the implementation returns, I get an errorp  perror for object 0x100105790 pointer being freed was not allocated  set a breakpoint in mallocerrorbreak to debug. p  pI know this is because as the value goes out of scope upon the functions return, the destructor is called for the object but my destructor assumes a pointer that was allocated, thus the error. I was curious if there was a way to test if the genome was already allocated or not. If not I would do something else for the destructor Is this even a problem worth bothering about since I already have it working by passing in the reference The function is not actually destructive I just have a desire to do some tricks.

Negative 5263 pI have a complex application, and recently some users have been bumping with and error on a process that used to work just fine. When they click the button, the process runs and finishes but then the application throws the error creating window handle exception and freezes. So I started reading about the handles and all, and some people mention the 10.000 limit and stuff. I checked with a handle verifying tool, and at the point of the process the application was floating around 1000 handles. So I decided to check the GDI objects and it was aways around 250. I never managed to reproduce the error on my machines.  Anyone have any idea of what might be exploding the handlers error with these conditionsp

Negative 5263 pItem 13 from Scott Mayers Effective Modern C states to prefer constiterators over iterators. I agree but I also want to use nonmember functions rather than member functions. According to the book there should be a nonmember function codestdcbegincode and codestdcendcode in C14. p  pTo make use of this functions I just installed gcc version 4.9.2 and compiled with the flag codestdc14code. It seems to compile until I try to use codestdcbegincode. I start searching for the support for this function but couldnt find anything about it. For example, at a hrefhttpsgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocslibstdcmanualstatus.html relnofollow titlegnu onlinedocs statusgnu onlinedocs statusa the function isnt even mentioned.p  pMy question is, will codestdcbegincode and codestdcendcode really be supported in c14 or is this a mistake in the book If it will be a C14 feature, are there compilers which already support these functions and when will gcc support itp  pThere are many questions at SO about codebegincode but these questions are about the member functions or about the constexprness and not about the support of the nonmember variant.p
Negative 5263 pIm using a custom PHP script to submit requests to the mturk API, based on the signature functions from a hrefhttpscode.google.compphpawssourcebrowsetrunkclass.turk.phpspecsvn26ampr26 relnofollowthe PHPAWS librarya.

Based on your request, your signature should be generated using the following string AWSMechanicalTurkRequesterNotifyWorkers20150625T093751Z.  Check to make sure your system clock and timezone is not incorrect.  Our current system time 20150625T093751Z.  1435225071849codep  pWhen I get the codeAWS.BadClaimsSuppliedcode error, repeatedly rerunning the script will cause it to eventually work. By work, I mean that either API returns codetruecode and the desired action is taken, or it returns an error thats relevant to the action Im requesting. p  pI assume that if I were performing the hash incorrectly or with the wrong signature, then it would never work. The intermittent nature of the problem makes me think its a timing error. But the example above shows an error message in which the time I used for my signature is the same as their time, so that doesnt seem like the problem either. p  pokay, it would work once in every 2160 tries.p  pI tried backdating my timestamps by 1 second just in case I was a little ahead of them that didnt change the results. I cant think of any other way to debug this. p
Negative 5263 pIn Java, using the RMI API, you can execute arbitrary code by sending it to a remote machine to execute.  Im aware something similar but not quite the same can be achieved in .NET using Remoting or WCF.p  pBut from my experience, neither allows arbitrary code execution, the remote machine still needs a reference to the object, not just an interface.  Is that correctp  pIve gotten around it by having a DLL accessible in a shared location which is updated and the remote machine is able to use that in order to execute code.

Or maybe documentation to improve my skills with the javascript canvas.. i hope im clear enough. once this problem is solved ill start thinking about the backend part of the project...p  pdiv

Negative 5263 pSo guys, this is a big onebr Im currently working on an App which involves a big database creation. Basicalls what it does is scanning the entire device for any kind of media file and adds it to the database filtered by certain file extensions.br The way it currently does that is scanning through the devices folders with a recursive function, and every time it finds a file that is actually a file and not a directory AND matches the file extensions I picked it adds the files path to a previously created ArrayList containing only strings.br This is implemented in an AsyncTask so its done in the background.br As soon as that task finishes it passes the ArrayList on to another AsyncTask that is responsible for adding those files to the database. Out of simplicity resons I only took the files path, its name and the title that is stored in its tags for every entry simple sqlite stuff and displayed the titles in a ListView in another activity over cursor adapters and so on which isnt really an issue in my case.br Right now it workes pretty well, doesnt crash or return anything bad Im testing on a OnePlus One right now.br BUT I have a really big music library on my phone around 5400 songs which is nearly filling my entire storage. And out of some unknown reason to me, the scanning task i mentioned with the ArrayList stops at around 3000 files and passes the ArrayList on to the second task, which is obviously not what Im aming at to have.br My guess is that there might be a big performance issue and using an ArrayList is not the best way to approach this. It might work with a number of files that is under 3000 but higher than that is also necessary...br So what would you guys suggest Does my approach lack something or do I have to try something completely differentp

The problem is that on some versions of 4.4.2 it will only appear once and after dismissing it the datePicker wont show again. p  pHave anyone stumbled on something similar Is there a way to get hold of this datePicker instance to, maybe, explicitly hideshow it I have tried the following to no availp  precode        Override         public boolean onJsAlertWebView view, String url, String message, JsResult result              return super.onJsAlertview, url, message, result                   Override         public boolean onJsConfirmWebView view, String url, String message, JsResult result              return super.onJsConfirmview, url, message, result                   Override         public boolean onJsPromptWebView view, String url, String message, String defaultValue, JsPromptResult result              return super.onJsPromptview, url, message, defaultValue, result          codepre  pmany thanksp

Negative 5263 pI am working on legacy javaj2ee project which is using ServletsJSPJDBC, it has been evolving since long hence there is no framework involved. However we have followed command pattern for servlets and done same basic application of OOPs concepts. We dont have Service layer nor the DAO layer . Below is the basic design of application.p  pAll servlets extend a base servlet , This base Servlet holds the DB connection variable  which is a instance variable . All the BeansVOs hold the code for getting data from DB too along with Setter and getter code . Each Bean has connection variable  instance variablep  pEach time a servlet gets invoked it calls the Super servlet to get connection object  the servlet get the connection object using DButil class using Datasource  and when servlet wants to get any data from DB it calls the respective Bean and sets the connection object and the bean performs all the DB operation using plain old JDBC code once the Bean is done with fetching of data and control goes back to servlet the servlet closes the connection before forwarding to JSP.p  pNow I want to improve the design , I know i can bring in serviceDAO layer but this is time consuming as the application has about 300400  Beans  we also have 300 tables this would take atleast 34 months with 510 resources .p  pSuper Servlet , this is extended by all Servlets.p  precodeimport java.sql.Connection import java.util.MissingResourceException import java.util.ResourceBundle  import javax.servlet.RequestDispatcher import

Negative 5263 pI have been trying to record to a single wave file with more than 2 channels with NAudio and I keep getting an InvalidParameter calling waveInOpen. I figured that this has to do with the fact that im trying to record with more than 2 channels.p  pThe error occurs when the WaveIn.StartRecording is called when the channel count is more than 2. It works when the channels are mono and stereo. p  pIs there a way to call the waveInOpen function with parameters that are outside the range Is there a way to edit the waveInOpen function to accept more than 2 channelsp  pThanks for the helpp

Negative 5263 pI have a CMS written in ASP.NET MVC.  I have written a custom route handler that looks at the incoming path and determines where to route it i.e. custom redirect,category page, product page, etc.  The current routes are stored in the cache on a memcached server.  Everything works great until we get high loads on the server.  I then either get errors retrieving from the cache or even 404 errors at times.

Negative 5263 pCurrently, Im using specialized listeners in my application. For exemple the listener for the default system output device is implemented like this p  precodeaudioPropertyAddressgtmSelector  kAudioHardwarePropertyDefaultOutputDevice audioPropertyAddressgtmScope  kAudioObjectPropertyScopeGlobal audioPropertyAddressgtmElement  kAudioObjectPropertyElementMaster  err  AudioObjectAddPropertyListenerBlockkAudioObjectSystemObject, audioPropertyAddress, dQueue, defaultDeviceListener codepre  pAnd it works fine. The problem is that I have a lot of listeners.p  pId prefer to use a generic listener who could intercept all changes in the audio, so I use wildcard constants p  precodeaudioPropertyAddressgtmSelector  kAudioObjectPropertySelectorWildcard audioPropertyAddressgtmScope  kAudioObjectPropertyScopeWildcard audioPropertyAddressgtmElement  kAudioObjectPropertyElementWildcard codepre  pBut in fact the listener misses a lot of events, like a modification of the audio volume, a mute, and so on.p  pWhat should I do p
