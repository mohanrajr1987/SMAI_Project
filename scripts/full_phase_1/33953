Positive 33953 pI am very new to Open Street Map. I have some data that need to be shown on a map by Open Street Map from C VS2013. The application can be WPF or windows forms.p  pThe data is about some statistics results by location.p  pFor example,p  plocation,  latitude, longitude, address, population, household, income of household, tax of householdp  pThe data was got from a database by running SQL query from C code. The data volume may have 1 million rows. I need to do some aggregation so that they can be displayed on the map clearly. For example, aggregate all houshold located in zip code 10080 information in a circle displayed on the map.p  pMoreover, I need to provide the following functions the on map so that the users can dop  p1 when zoom in to a location, more detailed data from zip code to street level will be shown.p  p2 when zoom out, only the aggregated data was shown. For example, from street level to zip code level.p  p3 users can get detailed data by selecting any location on the map as long as the location has data to show. For example, if a location in zip code  10080 was selected, all household information in the selected location can be shown.p  p4 users can hold control and click any location so that multiple locations household information can be show.p  pI have checked OSM wiki website and API, but I still have no idea how to add the data to a OSM map and edit the map to show it clearly.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p

Positive 33953   pGreetings everyone,p  pI am developing a strategy game in C and while I was working on UI behaviour, I thought about a construction that allows code being written like thisp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeThis is running in a parallel thread.  Vector2 targetPosition  UI.ChoosePosition waits for position being picked tank.GoTotargetPosition instructs the tank to go to that position codepre  pThe code above is running in a seperate thread than the main UpdateDraw loop. For clarity I will call the thread with the UpdateDraw loop the main thread, and the thread that runs the above code will be called parallel thread It is never actually run simultaneously to the main thread  a construction of semaphores allows me to give the control to the parallel thread and back to the main thread as soon as the parallel thread is waiting. As long as the parallel thread is working, the main thread is waiting.p  pThe current thread stops when ChoosePosition is called and continues when a position is picked and the main thread allows it to continue running. All this works great, and I am quite content how clean the code looks. You can simply read it from top to bottom, which is far worse when such behaviour is programmed into an Update method that runs in a loop.p  pYou see that I dont actually need threads for this  I just want to have multiple stacks at once. The part about threads that cares about speeding up programs through parallel code execution is irrelevant for me. I guess that this causes some overhead, as I have to wait for the OS to switch to the parallel thread and back. I am not quite sure how much overhead though.p  pNow I thought about using a similar construction for unit behaviour, which would allow me to write code of similar cleanness, e. g. like thisp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeShooting behaviour of the tank. Again, this is running in a parallel, but synchronized thread. whiletarget.IsAlive ampamp tank.IsDisrupted      tank.TurnTurrettargetDirection suspends current thread until turret is turned correctly     tank.WaitForShotReady suspends thread again     tank.Shoot     soundSystem.StartSoundEffecttankshooting     particleSystem.EmitParticlestank.TurretMuzzlePosition  codepre  pThe problem is that this would require an own stack for every active unit, and that means an own thread for every active unit. Aditionally, as stated above, I fear some OS overhead from the thread switching. This leads me to my first questionp  h2Is there a class in the .NET framework that allows me to have a seperate stack without having the overhead of a threadh2  psupsubStack obviously referring to the call stack, and not to the data structure.subsupp  pAFAIK the strongThreadPoolstrong and strongTaskstrong classes which internally either uses a new thread or the ThreadPool are not suited for longrunning tasksthreads as they provide a limited number of threads and therefore a limited number of stacks. According to MSDN, a task marked as longrunning just creates a thread in the background.p  pOf course I benchmarked the performance implications of running a lot of threads that are not in the readyqueue. It turns out that they are quite acceptable the creation of 10k threads takes a bit under a second, and as I can reuse threads for new units once an old one dies, this performance overhead comes only at loading time. The frame time overhead of 10k threads seems to be about 12 ms per frame although I tested with a very high framerate, Im not sure how this scales, which isnt that great, but probably acceptable, considering 10k units will require a lot of performance anyway and therefore be more like the upper bound of units existing simultaneously.p  pAnd before you ask yes, memory consumption was a few hundred megabytes, but thats relatively low compared to the memory the rest of the game requires. Its not designed for lowend computers anyway  p  pSo my result is basically Performance overhead is not great, but acceptable even with threads. But The performance was terrible like, literally a hundred times worse when I ran the benchmark with Visual Studio debugging, because the VS 15 UI displays all the threads and a lot of threadrelated events. I like this behaviour in general, because it makes debugging multithreaded applications much easier, but when displaying emtheseem threads, performance is kill. So my second question which would be answered by the first one, too isp  h2Is there a possibillity to hide a thread from Visual Studioh2  pYou might now argue that threads are not made for mass production and constant blocking, and that this approach is an abuse of threads. That might be true, but there are several reasons against thisp  ol liMy task manager shows me more than 1.5k threads running right now, while just having a browser and Visual Studio open. This doesnt seem to cause any performance issues, and I bet that most of these threads are not in the ReadyQueue but are currently blocking. I cant look it up in the Windows task manager, but when using htop on Linux its visible that most threads are not actually doing anything. Not only my benchmarks, but the system I use everyday shows me that having a lot of idle threads in the background is no problem at all.li liMSowned Windows Forms works in a kind of similar way when a dialog box is opened, the current thread stops, but certain OS threads keep the window semiresponsive make noise when clicked. This requires a vastly smaller amount of threads though.li liEven if threads are not really designed for this use case, they might still work just fine. If you say dont use threads, they arent made for this, I would prefer a reason that refers to the properties of the concept or implementation of the thread, and not to the incentive of the author of threads  because an incentive alone doesnt neccesarily break anything li ol  pI guess that I am not the only person on earth encountering this kind of situation. Is there maybe a pattern that could be applied here p  pI know that I could probably use some scripting engine. But I really like C and its ecosystem, and I would like to not have even more external dependencies.p

Positive 33953 pIm using Visual Studio 2013. I have a Custom Build Tool I think thats the right terminology at least created which processes Simulink .slx files. The gist of how it works is that VS will compile a Simulink model by launching MATLABSimulink and telling it to build the Simulink model into a DLL and generate some headers for use in other VS projects in the Solution. That functionality works just fine from the MATLABSimulink side. p  pThis Custom Build Tool, called Real Time Workshop  SLX, consists of a .props file, a .targets file, and a .xml file. To use it, I have a VS project with its Configuration Type set to Utility Properties, General page and my Custom Build Tool checked in the projects Build DependenciesBuild Customization... dialog. Then I drag various .slx files onto the project in the Solution Explorer and it adds them. Then I can build the project and it will process each .slx file as described above. p  pEach .slx file is dependent on a number of MATLAB scripts and other files. Changes in one of those other files needs to trigger a rebuild of the .slx file by Simulink. Currently, whenever the .slx file itself is unchanged, VS just skips over it. I cant seem to set additional dependencies for the .slx files.p  pIf I go to the Properties dialog for an individual .slx file, the Item Type specifies my Real Time Workshop  SLX as expected. However, when I go to the General page underneath Real Time Workshop  SLX things are grayed out and there is no Additional Dependencies entry.p  pI thought the purpose of Custom Build Tools was specifically to enable special processing like this. How do I specify file dependencies for the individual .slx files to be processed by my Real Time Workshop  SLX Custom Build Toolp  pOne other thing to note is that it appears that additional dependencies can be added to the .props file within the codeltAdditionalDependenciesgtcode tag, but then that creates a dependency relationship for emallem .slx files, which is not a viable solution.p

TDMGCC gfortran is perhaps the closest I got, as I could run a DLL created from gfortran, but not in C. In fact, in TDMGCC gfortran, after I created a Fortran DLL that was referencing a C DLL, all function calls to the Fortran generated DLL within Excel VBA would immediately return 0, even after no warnings were given after compiling the Fortran DLL In other cases, it said it could not find the function name in the DLL, even though I made them without decorations or underscores. Excluding the C DLL from that build would eliminate that problem, but of course, I need to reference the C DLL as it has required 3rd party functions.p  pI looked at other posts and could not find an answer to this questionp  ul lipMy question is not a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22134259fortrandllimportimporting a Fortran DLL into c or Capli lipI do not get the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10381739runfortrandllwithvisualstudioAdd as Link option when right clicking AddExisting Itemapli lipThe answer from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1237129howtocallcsharpcodefromfortrandllthis posta did not solve my questionpli lipA similar question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23433508fortrancallingacdllwhichinturncallsanotherfortrandllherea was not answered adequatelypli ul  pPlease provide a stepbystep guide to getting Fortran to work with DLLIMPORT, with both gfortran and Intel Visual Studio Fortran, if possible.

Negative 33953 h3Summaryh3  pI have a table that has a uique primary key identifying each record. I also have three more fields that can identify a recordp  ul liCategoryli liCategoryNumberli liDuplicateNumberli ul  pWhen I add a new record and choose the Category, how can I get CategoryNumber to increment correctly based on whether it is a duplicate or not.p  pNote that this is one big table.  This is merely an upgrade from excel to access.p  h3tldrh3  pYesterday I asked about how to deal with multiple keys in Access.  May be I did not ask the right question because my problem is even more puzzling today.p  pHere is what I am trying to do and where I am getting stuck.p  pI am creating a database to keep track of my film photos taken on a variety of different films and formats with different cameras a total of 18 different independent pieces of information for each photo that span back almost 15 years.  Years ago I kept the data in MS Excel and programed the input form to do what I am about to explain.p  pI wanted to keep track of the photos in two ways.  The first was a master photo number that would let me know how many total photos I had in my files.  It was a sequentail number that I never intended to ever delete something in that sequence.  It would be a number that would uniquely identify each photo.  I see this as my primary key for the whole database.p  pBut I also wanted to file the slides, negatives, and transparencies according to general groups or categories so that I could quickly pull them if I needed to make a photo submission or I was looking for something specific.  So I also added a category identifer e.g. Landscapes had a LS name attached as well or Sunsets as SS etc.  I also wanted to keep a running sequential number for each slide that was in each category.  So e.g. one of my first photos in my data base has PhotoID  3, its Category  LS and its CategoryID  1.  Further down I have PhotoID  14, Category  LS and CategoryID  2.p  pNow in addition to these, I further have another number that I need to keep track of and that was if I made duplicate exposures of the same scene.  To work this I just added a DuplicateNumber to each photo.  If it had no duplicates then DuplicatNumber was 0, if it had one dupe than DuplicateNumber was 1, 2 dupes, DuplicateNumber was 2 etc.p  pSo I had two ways for finding any photo in my files.  Either by the PhotoID which was sequential in the Database but not in my physical files, or by the combination of Category, CategoryID and DuplicateNumber, which are how I physically file the photos.p  pNow in Excel what I did was when I opened my form, I first had to choose what category to put the photo in via radio buttons on the form.  I would then fill in all the pertinent data for the photo.  When I executed the form, it would find the last number in the master sheet, increment it and add all the data to a new record.  It would then activate the category sheet for the category I chose, determine the last number in that sheet, increment it and add in the new data there as well.p  pAn important note is that DuplicateNumber is always 0 by defalut unless I made it 1, 2 etc.  It was never computed, but I entered it.p  pWhen I created slide lables the report I would include the main PhotoID, The CategoryName, CategoryID and DuplicateNumber in this format 1LS1.0, 14LS45.0, 15LS45.1 and in addtion the location and Date taken.p  pBut now I dont want to use Excel anymore and have tried to migrate the database to MS Access.  So I have one main table called PhotoDetails.p  pPhotoID is the primary key in this table.  It has a PhotoCategory field that is a number that has a relation to another table called Category.  Its Primary key is PhotoCategoryID and it is also a foreign key in PhotoDetails.  PhotoCategoryID is a number that identifies each category.  In the list of all my categories, LS is number 11.  But here is where I get stuck.p  pI have CategoryNumber, which is the number identifying the photo in each category, and DuplicateNumber, identifying the number of duplicates, in the PhotoDetal table.  What I cant figure out is when I add a new photo, how do I increment the CategoryNumber  The form I have right now allows me to enter in all the data, and when I click to enter the next it will autonubmer the PhotoID key, but what about CategoryNumber  I cant remember what the last number is for each Category so as for me to enter that number in myself.  Unless I mimic what I did in Excel by having all the data stored twice, once in the PhotoDetails aka Master Sheet in Excel and again in multiple Category tables.  I was hoping Access could provide me a workaround.p  pCurrently the relationships I have are the Category table linked to PhotoDetails in a 1M relation.  I also have several other tables all linked in a 1M relation e.g. table Film stores the different films I have used and the 1M relation lets me link what film to each slide, and most of the other data is stored in that way.p  pI have 31 different Categories.  Each photo has a Category and a CategoryID number, as well as a Duplicate number.  I will choose the Category on data entry and the DuplicateNumber, but I want the CategoryID number as well as PhotoID to be incremented automatically for me.  What is the correct way to proceed with this where I only have to keep one PhotoDetail table that is not duplicated for each category as I did in Excel.p

Negative 33953 pOOP is about programming with interface, not the implementation. Objects are talking to each other using their interfaces. When interfaces are not well defined one object can know too much about the other and if you need to change implementation of your object youll need to change your programm in different places. Thats really bad, its all about changing things in one place and a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDon27t5Frepeat5Fyourself relnofollowDRYa principles. So my question is the following what if make interface context. Interface context will make sure that if object provides multiple interfaces other objects will only be able to use the one they need. This will ease things and reduce possibility of errors. p  pLet me introduce the example some abstract class that let us read text and write text. So it has two interfaces reader and writer. If you are dealing with reader, all you need is reader methods. So we can remove the writer interface. In the real world youll still see the reader part in IDEs like Visual Studio. But what if make such a thing that would allow you to declare Im in the reader context and youll be able to do things only related to reading and every class will show you its reader related interface. What do you think Does it make sense Like addins to Visual Studio that will hide other interfaces when set to onep

Negative 33953 pIm thinking of using pureconst functions more heavily in my C code. a hrefhttpgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocsgccFunctionAttributes.html relnofollowpureconst attribute in GCCap  pHowever, I am curious how strict I should be about it and what could possibly break.p  pThe most obvious case are debug outputs in whatever form, could be on cout, in some file or in some custom debug class. I probably will have a lot of functions, which dont have any side effects despite this sort of debug output. No matter if the debug output is made or not, this will absolutely have no effect on the rest of my application.p  pOr another case Im thinking of is the use of some SmartPointer class which may do some extra stuff in global memory when being in debug mode. If I use such an object in a pureconst function, it does have some slight side effects in the sense that some memory probably will be different which should not have any real side effects though in the sense that the behaviour is in any way different.p  pSimilar also for mutexes and other stuff. I can think of many complex cases where it has some side effects in the sense of that some memory will be different, maybe even some threads are created, some filesystem manipulation is made, etc but has no computational difference all those side effects could very well be left out and I would even prefer that.p  pSo, to summarize, I want to mark functions as pureconst which are not pureconst in a strict sense. An easy examplep  precodeint fooint attributeconst  int barint x     int sum  0    forint i  0 i lt 100 i        sum  foox    return sum   int foocallcounter  0  int main     cout ltlt bar 42   ltlt bar42 ltlt endl    cout ltlt foo callcounter   ltlt foocallcounter ltlt endl   int fooint x     cout ltlt DEBUG foo ltlt x ltlt  ltlt endl    foocallcounter    return x  or whatever  codepre  pNote that the function emfooem is not const in a strict sense. Though, it doesnt matter what emfoocallcounterem is in the end. It also doesnt matter if the debug statement is not made in case the function is not called.p  pI would expect the outputp  precodeDEBUG foo42 bar 42  4200 foo callcounter  1 codepre  pAnd without optimisationp  precodeDEBUG foo42 100 times bar 42  4200 foo callcounter  100 codepre  pBoth cases are totally fine because what only matters for my usecase is the return value of bar42.p  pHow does it work out in practice strongIf I mark such functions as pureconst, could it break anythingstrong considering that the code is all correctp  hr  pNote that I know that some compilers might not support this attribute at all. BTW., I am collecting them a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2798188pureconstfunctionattributesindifferentcompilersherea. I also know how to make use of thes attributes in a way that the code stays portable via defines. Also, all compilers which are interesting to me support it in some way so I dont care about if my code runs slower with compilers which do not.p  pI also know that the optimised code probably will look different depending on the compiler and even the compiler version.p  hr  pVery relevant is also a hrefhttplwn.netArticles285332 relnofollowthis LWN article Implications of pure and constant functionsa, especially the Cheats chapter. subThanks ArtemGr for the hint.subp

Negative 33953 pI started this task assuming it to be pretty trivial one. However, going to the depths i find that its either not that simple or may be i am using a wrong approach here. In my case i have a number of documents which are not in the same directory however, they have the same namestitle. What i want is to carry out a site based search and resolve the document with least number of unrequired results.p  pSo I decided to create a DocumentID my custom ID which is unique for each document and while storing the document using SPFiles Properties bucket I stored this new custom property DocumentIDalong with its value for every item. Now when i try searching out the document based on its DocumentID value i stored I dont get any results.p  pReading the problem on internet gave me hint that i should be creating a Managed property to be able to search within custom properties. As required i did the same however, i could not find an appropriate crawled property for my custom property DocumentID. Now unless i find the correct crawled propery which i believe isnt under my control i wont be able to utilize the power of Managed property search.p  pAnyone having a better idea or a solution to the point where i am stuck at Any help would be highly appreciated.p  pThanks and Regards, Raghup

Negative 33953 pAs you know, when you upgrade from Rails 2 to 3 you replace thisp  precodelinktoremote more, url gt ... codepre  pwith thisp  precodelinkto more, ..., remote gt true codepre  pBut how do you handle the update option in linktoremote In a hrefhttprailscasts.comepisodes205unobtrusivejavascript relnofollowRailscast 205a Ryan Bates demonstrates codelinktocode with coderemotecode and a server response that includes JavaScript code to update a particular element in a page, but this practice seems wrong to me. I want my servers response to be a simple HTML fragment which is easy to test and which can be used by different pages clients in different ways. I dont think the server should have to know the ID of the target element on the requesting page as it ties the action to the page a miniclient and therefore makes it less general it also feels uglier than a pure HTML response.p  pSo, to be explicit, is there a way to do something like thisp  precodelinktoremote more, url gt ..., update gt productslist codepre  pwith Rails 3 and UJS Or do I have to write JavaScript to capture the servers HTML response and insert it into the right element on the pagep  pemIf the latter, please describe the best approach can codelinktocodes coderemotecode option be used at all.emp

Negative 33953 pI have an codeIObservablecode that produces values at random intervals and I want to throttle this sequence. One thing I have found out is that the codeThrottlecode operators definition of throttling is not the same as mine.p  pcodeThrottlecode only produces values after the specified interval elapses strongwith silencestrong it produces the last value seen. I thought throttling would mean producing values at the specified interval unless theres silence, of course.p  pSay, I expected codeObservable.Interval100.Select,i gt i.Throttle200code to produce modulo any performancetiming issues the even numbers, since I am throttling it to halfspeed. However that sequence produces no value at all, because theres never a period of silence of length 200.p  pSo, I discovered that codeSamplecode actually does the throttling behavior I want. codeObservable.Interval100.Select,i gt i.Sample200code produces again, modulo any performancetiming issues the sequence of even numbers.p  pHowever, I have one other problem the interval varies, depending on the last sampled value. What I want is to write an operator that looks like thisp  precodepublic static IObservableltTgt SampleltTgtthis IObservableltTgt source, FuncltT, TimeSpangt intervalSelector codepre  pThe codeintervalSelectorcode parameter produces the interval for the next sample, and the first sample... is either taken at the first value or from an additional parameter, I dont care.p  pI tried writing this but I ended up with a large convoluted construction that did not work quite right. My question is, can I build this using the existing operators aka, with a onelinerp

Negative 33953 pIm trying to integrate Google Analytics into my Android project using the information on the a hrefhttpcode.google.commobileanalyticsdocsandroidhowItWorks relnofollowwebsite of the respective SDKa. However, there is very little documentation available. My project has 6 different Activities and I noticed that using the method on the website results in a unique visit in Google Analytics for each Activity that is being opened, even if its still in the same session. Apparently, Google Analytics for Android never reuses a previously used session.p  pTheir method is to start tracking activity in onCreate and then stop tracking in onDestroy. The problem I have with this is that a session will stay active if a user presses the home button instead of the back button, since the Activity will not be destroyed. Therefore I chose to do it in onResume and onPause instead but that means that new sessions gets opened when a new Activity is opened.p  pDoes anyone know any way to really track a single session over multiple Activitiesp

Negative 33953 pUsing Python 2.6, Twisted 10.1, and GTK 2.22, with latest pygtk installed, Im having problems on shutdown. When I close my application and shut down the reactor using the codegtk2reactorcode of course, the application simply freezes. p  pIve poked around the twisted source and added debug messages. What ends up happening is, the codeshutdowncode event fires, codePortableGtkReactor.crashcode is called, which calls codegtk.mainquitcode. The event gets processed at the end of codeReactorBase.runUntilCurrentcode. When the function returns, control goes to codeReactorBase.iteratecode, which returns control to codePortableGtkReactor.simulatecode, which goes back to... the codegtk.maincode call. It looks like codegtkcode just doesnt quit.p  pUnfortunately, when I put together a very simple example with twisted and the gtk Hello World sample, everything shut down correctly. It must be something my application is doing. Until I can figure it out further, though...p  pWhat might be causing this Like what could an app do that causes gtk to not quit The app worked fine on Gtk 2.12, with Python 2.5 and Twisted 8.1, if that helps at all.p

Negative 33953 pUIView creates a window graphics context before a custom codedrawRectcode method is invoked, so inside the method I can get the graphics context. However, it seems that strongthe only waystrong to get a window graphics context in iOS, so I can make a CGLayer object based on a window graphics context only in a custom codedrawRectcode method of a UIView object. p  pHowever, I might want a model object to contain a CGLayer object, which is created with the model object itself, and later a lot of views use the layer to draw its content on their own views. One might create a bitmap graphics context to create a CGLayer, but then everything drawn on the screen using the CGLayer object will have characteristics of a bitmap context, as Apples documents say that drawing with a CGLayer object is restricted to the type of the graphics context used to create the layer.p  pSo my question is, is it really impossible to create a window graphics context outside codedrawRectcode to make a CGLayer object based on it. Or, is there a better way to create and store a CGLayer object for onscreen drawing that may be shared by multiple views Or is it a completely bogus idea to have such a shared CGLayer object outside a UIView object for a reason I dont realizep

Negative 33953 pCurrently attempting to sort a vector of object, with each object containing a string, in Cp  pThe strings can contain letters or numbers due to a design constraint, this is necessary, as the comparator can be changed.p  pAt the moment, the class of the object is overloaded, so that when two objects are compared, the strings they contain are compared.

Negative 33953 pSo I have four tables. Each table has a single id for the previous table id. So my in click table has an id and an id for the ad from which it came.

Negative 33953 pI have successfully created a threading example of a thread which can update a Progressbar as it goes.  However doing the same thing with multiprocessing has so far eluded me.

I know from looking around that different OSs may behave very differently, especially with multiprocessing and tkinter.p  pI have tried a producer which talks directly to the widget, through both namespaces and event.wait, and event.set.  I have done the same thing with a producer talking to a consumer which is either a method or function which talks to the widget.  All of these things successfully run, but do not update the widget visually.  Although I have done a get on the IntVar the widget is bound to and seen it change, both when using widget.step andor widget.set.  I have even tried running a separate tk instance inside the sub process.  Nothing updates the Progressbar.  p  pHere is one of the simpler versions.  The sub process is a method on an object that is a wrapper for the Progressbar widget.  The tk GUI runs as the main process.  I also find it a little odd that the widget does not get destroyed at the end of the loop, which is probably a clue Im not understanding the implications of.p  precodeimport multiprocessing from tkinter import  from tkinter import ttk import time  root  Tk  class mainwindow      def initself         self.dialogcount  0          self.parent  root         self.parent.titlemultiprocessing progess bar          frame  ttk.Labelframeself.parent         frame.packpady10, padx10          btn  ttk.Buttonframe, textCancel         btn.bindltButton1gt, self.cancel         btn.gridrow0, column1, pady10          btn  ttk.Buttonframe, textprogressbar         btn.bindltButton1gt, self.pbar         btn.gridrow0, column2, pady10          self.parent.mainloop      def pbarself, event          nameproducer d  self.dialogcount         self.dialogcount  1          pbar  pbardialogself.parent, titlename          event  multiprocessing.Event         p  multiprocessing.Processtargetpbar.consumer, argsNone, event          p.start        def cancelself, event        self.parent.destroy    class pbardialog      toplevelNone     pbarcount  0      def initself, parent, nsNone, eventNone, titleNone, max100         self.ns  ns         self.pbarvalue  IntVar         self.max  max          pbardialog.pbarcount  1         self.pbarvalue.set0           if not pbardialog.toplevel             pbardialog.toplevel Toplevelparent          self.frame  ttk.Labelframepbardialog.toplevel, texttitle         self.frame.pack         self.pbar  ttk.Progressbarself.frame, length300, variableself.pbarvalue         self.pbar.gridrow0, column1, columnspan2, padx5, pady5          btn  ttk.Buttonself.frame, textCancel         btn.bindltButton1gt, self.cancel         btn.gridrow0, column3, pady10         self.frame.pack       def setself,value         self.pbarvalue.setvalue      def stepself,increment1         self.pbar.stepincrement         print Current, self.pbarvalue.get      def cancelself, event        self.destroy      def destroyself         self.frame.destroy         pbardialog.pbarcount  1         if pbardialog.pbarcount  0             pbardialog.toplevel.destroy      def consumerself, ns, event          for  i in range21             event.wait2             self.step5             self.seti             printConsumer, i         self.destroy    if name  main     mainwindow codepre  pstrongFor contrast, here is the threading version which works perfectly.strong p  precodeimport threading from tkinter import  from tkinter import ttk import time  root  Tk  class mainwindow      def initself         self.dialogcount  0          self.parent  root         self.parent.titlemultiprocessing progess bar          frame  ttk.Labelframeself.parent         frame.packpady10, padx10          btn  ttk.Buttonframe, textCancel         btn.bindltButton1gt, self.cancel         btn.gridrow0, column1, pady10          btn  ttk.Buttonframe, textprogressbar         btn.bindltButton1gt, self.pbar         btn.gridrow0, column2, pady10          self.parent.mainloop       def producerself, pbar         i0         while i lt 101             time.sleep1             pbar.step1             i  1         pbar.destroy       def pbarself, event          nameproducer d  self.dialogcount         self.dialogcount  1          pbar  pbardialogself.parent, titlename          p  threading.Threadnamename, targetself.producer, argspbar,          p.start          p.join       def cancelself, event        self.parent.destroy    class pbardialog      toplevelNone     pbarcount  0      def initself, parent, nsNone, eventNone, titleNone, max100         self.ns  ns         self.pbarvalue  IntVar         self.title  title         self.max  max          pbardialog.pbarcount  1          if not pbardialog.toplevel             pbardialog.toplevel Toplevelparent          self.frame  ttk.Labelframepbardialog.toplevel, texttitle         self.frame.pack         self.pbar  ttk.Progressbarself.frame, length300, variableself.pbarvalue         self.pbar.gridrow0, column1, columnspan2, padx5, pady5          btn  ttk.Buttonself.frame, textCancel         btn.bindltButton1gt, self.cancel         btn.gridrow0, column3, pady10         self.frame.pack          self.set0      def setself,value         self.pbarvalue.setvalue      def stepself,increment1         self.pbar.stepincrement      def cancelself, event        self.destroy      def destroyself         self.frame.destroy         pbardialog.pbarcount  1         if pbardialog.pbarcount  0             pbardialog.toplevel.destroy             pbardialog.toplevel  None      def automaticself, ns, event          for i in range1,100             self.step  if name  main     mainwindow codepre

I would like to draw such plot on paper. But get some help from Mathematica if possible p  pWith this image as example could I obtain the 2D coordinate of each visible bar edges of the plotp  pI dont know if it is purely edge detection of an image from a plot or if we could get this info from the plot itself.p  pIdeally I would adjust the image size to match my paper size and obtain the coordinates scaled. It would be incredible.p  pThank You for your attention.p

Negative 33953 pIm implementing a basic starschema to provide purchase reports for my company. Our fact tables are summarized with 4 dimensions and aggregated with daily, weekly, monthly and yearly totals.p  pThe code currently knows how to process reports for single days, weeks, months and years. The next step is to implement arbitrary date range reporting. Provided a range, the goal is to understand the total number of years, months, weeks and days between the two dates and pull to appropriate records to calculate the total. The problem is we need to determine the count of each full period of granularity between the two dates, not just the amount of time elapsed. p  pFor example, 2 years have elapsed between 20090629 and 20110629, however we need to know that this range consists of one full year 2010, eleven months JanMay10 amp JulDec09 and 58 days Jun 12909 amp Jun 12911. p  pFrom this result we can pull the already summarized records from the 70 granular periods, combine and present a total. p  pIve been writing test code to determine the best way to break down a date range into its component parts, however Im stepping back as I suspect that Im overthinking this process. The current draft works asp  ol liPopulate a datesToParse array with the initial date range.li liDetermine if one or more full years exist between the dates.  ul liFor each year between the dates, remove that period from the date range and split the period before and period after the year into two new date ranges. li liPush the two new date ranges on the datesToParse stack.li liRepeatli ulli liWhen all possible years have been removed from the datesToParse array, repeat the process for months, weeks and days. li ol  pIn theory this should recursively reduce the initial date range down to a collection of full years, months, weeks and days.p  pIs there a better way to do this This seems like a problem that has been solved many times before. p

Negative 33953 pI have a simple address book type of database. Ive probably overnormalised, but its as much about productivity as it is learning.p  pI have a table, PEOPLE, with an ID generated identity, firstlast names, title, etc.  Also has a foreign key spouse on the ID field in its own table.  Obviously, nullable.p  pI have a table, ADDRESSES, with an ID generated identity, and all the details required for snail mail.p  pI have a table, PERSONADDRESS, with two foreign keys, PERSON pointing to PEOPLE.ID, and ADDRESS pointing to ADDRESSES.ID.p  pTheoretically, Ill have an EMAILS table with the foreign key to PEOPLE and the email.  Theoretically, people geeks like me can have more than one email.  And other relations between similar data in the future.  PHONES, etc..p  pSo, with that, the problem is this.  I want to produce some address labels.  Yes, its getting a little late for Christmas cards.  So, to get Libreoffice to do this, I think I need to create a view that LO can read its data from, where every field I want to spit out is already available.p  pThis is somewhat simple enough, except that, at the moment, I have a bit too much duplication.  My view is created as suchp  precodeCREATE OR REPLACE VIEW ADDRBOOK.LABELS AS   WITH T AS      SELECT DISTINCT       P1.ID AS AID,       P1.TITLE AS ATITLE, P1.GIVENNAME AS AGIVEN, P1.LASTNAME AS ALAST,       P2.TITLE AS BTITLE, P2.GIVENNAME AS BGIVEN, P2.LASTNAME AS BLAST,       A.STREET, A.MUNICIPALITY, A.STATE, A.COUNTRY, A.POSTALCODE     FROM       ADDRBOOK.ADDRESSES A         JOIN       ADDRBOOK.PERSONADDR PA         ON PA.ADDRESS  A.ID         JOIN       ADDRBOOK.PEOPLE P1         ON PA.PERSON  P1.ID         LEFT OUTER JOIN       ADDRBOOK.PEOPLE P2         ON P1.SPOUSE  P2.ID     ORDER BY P1.ID      SELECT DISTINCT     ATITLE, AGIVEN, ALAST,     BTITLE, BGIVEN, BLAST,     STREET, MUNICIPALITY, STATE, COUNTRY, POSTALCODE   FROM T  codepre  pHowever, this means that if persons A and B are married, Im going to get one entry where A is showing up under ATITLE, AGIVEN, ALAST, and B is BTITLE, BGIVEN, BLAST, and another entry where theyve reversed positions.  The distinct obviously doesnt work because theyre simply in different columns.  Im having trouble imagining the changes I would need to make this exclusion.p  pNote that disconnecting one of the two people from the address, which would be a simple solution for this particular issue, would run counter to the general table data concept to hold all these relationships for whatever purpose, and then extract what I need when I need it.  Granted, its 90 labels at this point, but as long as its a learning excersise, Im hoping someone can help me out here.p

Negative 33953 pWere in the midst of migrating a legacy VB6 application from a Sybase backend to a SQL Server 2008 R2.  Most applications are making the transition well, however I have one app that uses rigorous transaction control from within the code using named transactions.  Based upon some thorough testing, it appears that either client or server doesnt support begin, commit, and rollback commands at all.p  pPerforming a command like thisp  precodeconSQL.Execute begin tran CaptureSch , , adExecuteNoRecords codepre  pand then following it with a trancount always yields 0.  Additionally any attempt at committing the transaction later in the code produces a 3902 error.p  pUsing this command p  precodeconSQL.BeginTrans codepre  pdoes appear to yield some sort of behavior change, however the trancount is still zero, and this method wouldnt support nested transactions, which is what is required by the code.p  pIve attempted changing implicit transaction modes, various connection string parameters, and more to no avail.  Does anyone have any suggestions about how to get this type of functionality working  Samples of this type of functionality that I find online suggest that nested named transactions are supported if explicitly executed in the code.p  pThanks for the help.p

Negative 33953 pI am presently developing an EXTJS based portal making only asynchronous calls. The problem is that for only particular call in my portal, I have to access third party server which is like a black box to me with a reference ID. Third party server will process my request and generate results. I have to show these in my portal, and when user selects one of these results, selection has to be passed to both my server and the third party server. I want my portal to have minimum dependency on third party system. reference ID and data exchange is in JSON.p  pI cannot make any changes to the third party server. I am a starter so please excuse if my question is naive. If  you could direct me to some resources that would be fine too. I could have IFRAME but it spoils the consistency on my page. I also cannot lose the data entered by user prior to going to third party system. Thanksp

Negative 33953 pFor an assignment, I need to make a doll in Java where you can move it around and rotate the arms and legs to make funnycool poses. In addition, the legs should be able to stretch but not get wider, this is important.p  pThe way I wanted to handle the leg stretching was invert the rotation done to the leg to get it back in the neutral straight position, scale it in the y direction, and then reperform the rotation. However, it appears the scaling is always going to be in the y direction, so once its rotated, the leg will become wider. It will only look as it should if its brought back straight and standing.p  pThe code I have right now looks something like thisp  precodeleg.transformAffineTransform.getRotateInstancelegAngle,pivot.getX,pivot.getY.createInverse leg.transformAffineTransform.getScaleInstance1,scaleFactor leg.transformAffineTransform.getRotateInstancelegAngle,pivot.getX,pivot.getY codepre  pHow can I make sure the scaling stays relative to the image after rotationp

The inputs dont exist until the Update link is clickedp  pWhat I would prefer to do, if possible, is to create the nonform and form versions of each entry as the page is renbered and use some sort of toggle to display one or the other. Again, doable. Then, when I click the Edit link Id add the necessary attributes to the input so that entrys form elements will be read but the other display none elements for the other entries will be ignored. Im thinking out loud that if I add the attrname, somevalue that would work. That is, an input with no name will be ignored.  p  pYes, I can test this and I will. However, even if it works Im not sure if its a best practice andor theres a more ideal way of accomplishing my ends. Im here looking for validation andor additional expertise and input.p  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 33953 pIm not really sure how to handle the scenario I have in a good code manner.p  pThe basic of the criteria of my work is thisp  ul liA WPF application that consumes a WCF serviceli liThe service uses per session instancingli liThe session starts soon after application is started and should live through the application lifetime with small exceptionsli liSome method calls in a session must precede and be finished before others are calledli ul  pThis means I will have to be able to have one instance of a proxy client throughout the whole application. I will also have to be able to handle async calls, so the client wont hang up, but at the same time ensure they are finished.p  pMy technical understanding go WCF is limiting enough to not know if certain scenarios would work as intended. So Im going to list my uncertaintiesp  ul liWhen does a session start and when does it end. Is it based on the creation of clients or could a separate client instance access the same session if the first would go faulted.li liWhat is the best way to handle exceptions through a WCF serviceli liIs ChannelFactory something I should look at to help me put here.li ul  pSo what I did in the first iteration to try to solve some of these problems.p  ul liI used dependency injection to inject the client instance throughout the classes of my WPF application Im using MVVM to ensure the same instance is everywhere.li liI made the service reference using the asynchronous generation method to get the Begin and End versions of all methods to ensure the calls would be asyncli liI used the Coroutine IResult interface feature of the Caliburn.Micro framework to ensure one async action is finished before the other begins have no idea if this is a proper usage or if it is a smart move at all.li ul  pProblems I still have is of course how to handle a faulted state of the client. Im assuming right now that I could reinstance the client and either rescue the session or I could actually just set it up again as it was. I now need to reinstance it everyplace I injected it in with the same new instance.p  pSo I though perhaps it would be best to create a ClientManager class that would wrap the Client. That way I could inject this ClientManager and reinstance inside of him if needed. I guess I should expose him outwards to be able to make method calls but it would be great if I could error handle inside him in somehow. Im just having a hard time testing my methods and Im never certain it will work properly in integration because I dont understand all of the inner workings of WCF, coroutines and threading.p  pIs there anyone out there with more experience then me in these matters that could give me a few pointers or at least tell me how WCF works in these situations  per session  and what Im doing wrong and what right.p

Negative 33953 pI have a Django app on Heroku, with staging and production environments. Static files are hosted on S3. Im streamlining my deployment process and plan to set up fabfiles once I have things working manually.p  pHow can I configure collectstatic to push to multiple places If I run it locally, it uses my dev settings with a local STATICROOT. If I run it on one of my Heroku apps heroku run .manage.py collectstatic, then it cant grab the files since .slugignore ensures theyre never pushed to Heroku. The same applies if I include collectstatic in my Procfile.p  pIm also using djangopipeline, though its not yet doing much since Im stuck on the collectstatic bit.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong In response to Marats question, I tried passing a settings file as an option to collectstatic code.manage.py collectstatic settingsproject.settings.prodcode, but got an error codeUnknown command collectstaticcode I checked on the server though and Installed Apps does include django.contrib.staticfiles and I can also run collectstatic remotely, so Im not sure what would cause that.p

Negative 33953 pI am developing a WCF service based on a vendors implementation to receive data from them. I have a working version of this service using one way SSL with the client using our server certificate. Because of a recent change to their implementation, I now need to authenticate their client with a certificate instead of username and password.p  pThey develop in Java and I have no control over the client or the way they generate the certificate. They do not support the WSHttpBinding so I have to use the BasicHttpBinding. Their certificate is selfsigned and will unfortunately be that way in production. I tried using Transport for the security and according to our server admin had their certificate installed appropriately on our server I do not have access to our IIS server. I believe IIS was having an issue with the certificate because it is selfsigned so I moved away from that implementation.p  pAfter a lot of research I determined that it would probably only work if I validated their certificate in the service itself by getting it from the codeOperationContext.Current.ServiceSecurityContext.AuthorizationContext.ClaimSets[0]code. This is my first WCF service so I believe I have it set up correctly but am getting the following error when testing from my WCF test client codeThe private key is not present in the X.509 certificatecode.

It half works Xcode runs codesetupcode and codeTargetBcode at the same time, so codeTargetBcode may get built too soon. Not good enough.li liThe same, but specifying in the scheme not to build in parallel. This works, but is a waste, since there are other targets that strongcanstrong be built in parallel.li liRun the script in a codepreactioncode build step inside the scheme. This works, but seems wrong why output from that step doesnt go into the build log so perhaps Im not meant to use it this way.li ol  h2What I dont want to doh2  pAdd the script as a dependency of codeTargetBcode. This would work however, codeTargetBcode actually comes from another subproject, and in the context of building it, parameters to the script are not yet known mainly the root directory of codeTargetAcodes project.p  pAm I missing anything, or do I have to settle for 2 or 3 abovep  pstrongEDITstrong in option 2 above, changing the order of dependencies in my case, between codeSetupcode and codeTargetBcode does not help  Xcode still selects the order arbitrarily.p

Negative 33953 pOur application is highly concurrent. It is taking MQ data and saving it to a database.  There are multiple messages that might contain the same data.

Then the second transaction comes in with the same exact data for operating hours.  Now I need the location data to be saved, but the operating hours is a duplicate.  I cant make a check for operating hours on the database because of concurrency If I check, it might so it is not existing, then by the time I save it, it might have been inserted by another thread.

Negative 33953 pI have to implement a client socket which requires high throughput  800Mbps and low latency running on Windows 7 server. Overlapped IO seems the way to go for high performance. p  pRead some documentation on the subject, as far as I can see the advantage of overlapped IO is that you pass some structures with buffer to the OS and you are notified when they are filled. p  pNo I am wondering what the common ways are to combine this with a packet based protocol length delimited packets, header contains size of datablock Of course I can just read arbitrary chunks of data and copy the required number of bytes into a message struture. This means an additional copy action. p  pSecond option might be passing the message structure as a buffer with the header size, after getting it back pass the same structure again to read the requested number of databytes. In this case the first chunk read is small, but the data is saved into the message structure, and while the data block read is pending the read of the next header block can be initialized. p  pAny experiences or ideas how to handle length delimited packets the most efficient  p  pThanks,p

Through the help of the wonderful people who use stack overflow I was able to import all the properties of a chart into my property grid, however Now I cant figure out how to connect my chart to the propertyGrid, so when I change something in the grid the chart changes. p  pSo far I have p  precodepublic partial class Form1  Form      public Form1              InitializeComponent         magRadioBox.Checked  true         PropertyGrid propertyGrid1  new PropertyGrid         propertyGrid1.CommandsVisibleIfAvailable  true         propertyGrid1.Text  Graph and Plotting Options         propertyGrid1.PropertyValueChanged  propertyGrid1PropertyValueChanged          this.Controls.AddpropertyGrid1      private void Form1Loadobject sender, EventArgs e  this.Text  MY Plot Program propertyGrid1.SelectedObject  chart1    private void button1Clickobject sender, EventArgs e  some code that is populating my chartchart1 with data   .... chart1 being filled with data     private void propertyGrid1PropertyValueChangedobject s , PropertyValueChangedEventArgs e  Getting the MyChart instance from propertyGrid  MyChart myChart  MyChartPropertyGrids.SelectedObject Calling the method that will refresh my chart1  myChart.Invalidate   codepre  pThe above code is for my Form.

Negative 33953 pWorking on a fairly simple form with a captcha This is my first time dealing with captchas so I am using a prebuilt setup quickcaptcha 1.0p  pEverything currently is working fine The form, The captcha, except for the process Im thinking it has to do with the amount of links I have in between the variablesp  pHeres what I am thinking should happen. The form is shown to the user, and the user types in the information. The captcha is checked after the submit button through requestresult.php then if it is successful it hands it off over to resultsettings.php then in resultsettings it sends it to requestprocess.php which collected the variables in the include from the initial request.php form.p  pIm not sure....right now its sending two emails one with the body information and no input information attached, and one with nothing at all just below it.p  pHeres the code.p  prequest.phpp  precodelt          Subject and Email Variables       emailSubject  Request Form     webMaster  infomywebhost.com

Negative 33953 pIve tried using two different jquery plugins to get placeholders to work in ie9, a hrefhttpandrewjones.comjqueryplaceholderplugin relnofollowAndrew Jones onea and a hrefhttpsgithub.commathiasbynens relnofollowMathias Bynens onea. p  pUnfortunately, both of them are giving me the same set of issues, that for the life of me I cannot figure out. The first issue is, every now and then in the JS console I get the following error p  precodeSCRIPT438 Object doesnt support property or method placeholder codepre  p...which is as if the script didnt load, even though it has. Its usually the 5050 chance of that error showing up when I refresh the page.

Negative 33953 pI thought I understood the whole thing about NAT etc but now I came to a problem.br First what I assumedbr Because there are not enough IPv4 addresses available we need another system. The devices of today at home for connecting to the internet are a combination ofbr 1 A modem at the physicallevel to change the type of signals on the wire. br 2 A switch at linklevel so you can connect multiple computers to the devicebr 3 A router to connect all the computers to the internet and go beyond your homesubnet etc.br 4 A NAT to allow all the internal computers to connect to the outsidebr 5 A portforwarder to let connections from the outside to the internal networkbrp  pWhat I call a NATbr When making a request to the outside the NATpart of the device changes the sourceport and the sourceip of the request coming from an internal computer. The new sourceip will be your publicip. The NATpart will hold a record in a table with this mapping originalip, originalport, newport. br When a reponse comes back, the NAT will check the destinationport and compare this with the newports is in his table. If it finds a match the NAT will replace the destinationip with originalip and newport with originalport. As a consequence the response will be forwarded to the internal computer that made the request. So, the NATpart is for when a connection is initialized from the inside. When this request traverses the NAT, 2 things are changed sourceip and sourceport.p  pThen the portforwarderbr This part of the device will accept connections initialized in the outsideworld to your network. It will look at the destinationport of the incoming request and by making a rule for that portnumber it may change the destinationport and the destinationip of the request to an internal ip. With these rules a request from the outside can connect to a computer on your internal network and thus the portforwarder changes 2 things the destinationip and the destinationport.p  pA Before I ask my question, how is this explanationp  pNow my problem is with the response after a request came from the outside through the portforwarder. Assume the right rules are made and a request came through portforwarding on an internal computer. So in the portforwarder the destinationip was changed to the internalip of the computer and the destinationport was changed to the port where the service is running on. If this internalcomputer is a webserver it will generate a response. So the destinationip will be the requests sourceip and the destinationport will be the requests sourceport. The sourceip will be the internalip of the computer and the sourceport will be the port of the service.p  pNow that response has to go to the outside. So I assume it goes through the NAT to the outside So after passing the NAT, the sourceip will be the publicip and the sourceport will be random. Now I tested this with wireshark. I contacted a webserver behind a NAT and I saw the reponse was coming from port 80  How is this possible This indicates that the response of the forwarded request did not pass the NATp  pI rethought the concept and my new hypothesis is that when a connection is initialized from the outside, it will pass the portforwarder and reach the right computer. This will create a response and when this response reaches our allinonedevice, this device can recognize it forwarded the request of the response and will not change the sourceport. br B Is this indeed the case or is it done in another wayp  pWikipedia says about portforwarding The source address and port are, in this case, left unchanged. When used on machines that are not the default gateway of the network, the source address must be changed to be the address of the translating machine, or packets will bypass the translator and the connection will fail. a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPortforwarding relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPortforwardinga brThis confirms that the response of a forwarded request MUST go through the portforwarder again and not through the NAT so the sourceport wont be changed. The portforwarder will change the sourceip to the publicip.p  pCan someone verify this or give me another explanation than minep

Negative 33953 pI intend to create a small application with 2 windows, a normal window with controls and a 3D window, rendered with DirectX. For 3D window codePeekMessagecode is recommended because it doesnt wait after checking the messages but for normal windows no 3D rendering the codeGetMessagecode function is used to avoid processor senseless overuse. So, when the 3D window is active codeWMACTIVEcode message received I want to use codePeekMessagecode and when the normal window is active I want to use codeGetMessagecode.p  pThe main loop would look like thisp  precodeNormalWindowActive  false Window3DActive  false MSG msg  while TRUE      if PeekMessageampmsg, NULL, 0U, 0U, PMREMOVE          TranslateMessageampmsg         DispatchMessageampmsg          if NormalWindowActive          if GetMessageampmsg, NULL, 0, 0              TranslateMessageampmsg             DispatchMessageampmsg               else          RenderWindow       codepre  pIn the messages handler of these windows I have the codeWMACTIVATEcode messagep  precodeHWND NormalWindow, Window3D  These windows are global vars  LRESULT CALLBACK WndProcHWND hWnd, UINT msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam       ...     case WMACTIVATE         if wParam WAINACTIVE              if hWnd  NormalWindow                  NormalWindowActive  true                 Window3DActive  false              else                  Window3DActive  true                 NormalWindowActive  false                           break      ...  codepre  pWhat I expect from the TaskManager is to show the application busy 50 processor use when the 3D window is active and not so busy when the normal window is active 5 processor use. I only see 50 processor use when both windows have lost focus but I see 05 processor use when any of them is active. I believe that there should be a difference, so I am not sure if this is really working or even possible. The 3D window is rendered and the normal window responds to events, too, but the processor use confuses me. I just dont want this to affect the FPS of the 3D window.p

Negative 33953 pSo, my Drupal site is not reflecting any CSS changes I make. Ive tried doing a hard cache of the site, Ive tried multiple browsers, Ive checked the actual stylesheet  on the server to make sure its copying over the stylesheet reflects the changes, but the actual site does not. Ive, of course, gone to the clear cache section under configurationperformance on the admin panel. I have gone into the FTP and manually deleted the cache. I have cleared my own browsers cache. The CSS files are going in the correct folder Ive checked that, too. I have done literally everything I can think of. I have tried toggling the aggregate amp compress css options on and off, clearing the cache in between. I inspected the page source, and it is definitely still presenting with the old CSS.p  pEvery attempt at debugging has led me to believe that this has something to do with the DNS not refreshing.

Negative 33953 pI am trying to teach myself bioinformatics, arriving to the party by way of computer science and high performance computing.  Essentially, Im trying to learn the biology.  Ive recently discovered BioPython and so far think its great, but I am curious if anybody could help me identify why the translate method used in BioPython to convert sequence data to ORF candidates and amino protein chains is behaving differently than expected.p  pThe following is from this years DNA60 challenge, and its to find all of the ORFs in a sequence and sort them, convert them to amino chains, and then take the 25th amino acid from the longest top 15 chains to spell out a phrase.p  pHeres the challenge a hrefhttpgenomebiology.comaboutupdateDNA60TAGCGAC relnofollowhttpgenomebiology.comaboutupdateDNA60TAGCGACap  pSo after doing some research, I settled on using the code directly out of the tutorial for finding and identifying ORFs using the translate method, found herep  pa hrefhttpwww.biocloud.infoBiopythonench16.html relnofollowhttpwww.biocloud.infoBiopythonench16.htmlap  pModifying it to print out the 25th amino acide for each chain, and sorting the output by chain length using the linux command line tool sort, the output is entirely wrong.  p  pKnowing what the answer was supposed to be, I could not figure out why this wasnt working.  So I wrote my own script to do the ORF identification and and translation, sorted the output, and it worked  Using NCBI table 1, min length of 25.  p  pSo somehow, the ORF identification in the translate method is not working the way I think it should, and I was hoping somebody could tell me why.

In other words, Id like to show 5 previous things that the user has put into the app using the textfields. p  pI would like to display the text in each label using the format string for textfield1, string for 2, string for 3.

Negative 33953 pI have a table which has two columns codeValueAcode and codeValueBcode. I need to show the table in a grid, but I need to show either codeValueAcode or codeValueBcode, but not both.

Negative 33953 pRecently I was thinking about the differences and similarities between Backbone.js and AngularJS.p  pWhat I find really convenient in Backbone are the BackboneModels and the BackboneCollections. You just have to set the urlRoot and then the communication with the backendserver via Ajax basically works.p  pShouldnt it be possible to use just the BackboneModels and Collections in AngularJS application So we would have the best of both worlds twoway databinding with AngularJS and convenient access to the serverside or other storage options through BackboneModels and Collections.p  pA quick internet search didnt turn up any site suggesting this usage scenario. All resources either talk about using either the one or the other framework.p  pDoes someone have experience with using BackboneModels or Collections with AngularJS. Wouldnt they complement each other nicely Am I something missingp

Negative 33953 pI have a DLL that gets loaded as a plugin by a program I did not create and its purpose is to replace a pointer to a member function in an array inside the program to provide additional functionality to the existing program that loads it.p  pThe program that loads the plugin dll has source code that looks like thisp  precodeCore object that all objects inherit class MObject  public     variables      functions   enum ECmdIndex      CMDRUN  0x0,     ect     CMDMAX  0x500  Global command list of command functions typedef void MObjectCommandFuncSContextamp, void CommandFunc GCommands[CMDMAX]  Example command function void MObjectfuncCmdRunSContextamp context, void result      do stuff  GCommands[CMDRUN]  ampMObjectfuncCmdRun  This is used to execute command functions void MObjectProcessCommand SContextamp context, void result       ect      Execute the commands function on this MObject     Here is where my function should replace the default one     thisgtGCommands[context.cmdInd]context, result      ect  codepre  pMy DLL is fairly straight forward. It mainly replaces a command function in the programs GCommands array with one in the DLL.p  precodeMObject structure is replicated exactly in the DLL This is neccesary because my plugin is going beyond the provided API And so this is becoming a bit hacky class MObject  public     variables      functions   typedef void MObjectCommandFuncSContextamp, void  void MObjectMyCommandFuncSContextamp context, void result      do stuff   void onLoad      Get a pointer to GCommands array     CommandFunc pGCommands  GetGCommandOffset      Replaced the desired command function with the new one     pGCommand[0x1B]  ampMObjectMyCommandFunc  codepre  pA brief abstract The host program calls a member function pointer. My DLL should make the pointer point to its own function and do what is must to make that function callable when the host application goes to call that pointer.p  pThe issue is my new command function is never entered and the command no longer does anything when executed in the program.

Negative 33953 pThis is giving me some trouble... I dont quite understand whats happening. This is a Data Structures assignment and I have created every class as specified per the instructors UML diagram. This seems like an odd implementation of linked lists. I dont quite understand the constructor in the ListNode class calling another constructor and I dont understand why a counter wasnt specified to keep track of items in the list. I also dont understand the exception class I wrote as the instructor specifies that the second constructor calls the superclass constructor, and sends the following string as its argument  name   is empty  I just left that empty. I dont quite see how this works. I also completely have no clue how generics work. I did some reading but that didnt clear up much. Ill post my code and any help would be appreciated.

Negative 33953 pIm using a hrefhttpsgithub.comKnockoutContribKnockoutValidation relnofollowKnockout Validationa to validate my model in a DurandalKnockoutJS app.  Its working fine, but Ive run into a situation that Im not sure how to handle.  One of the things that users enter is a list of instructors, and they can enter an arbitrary number of instructors.  Each instructor has a teaching percentage value. The sum of all teaching percentages must add up to 100.p  pIm not sure how to setup the validation for this, because when Im defining my model object for Instructors, I cant reference an arbitrary number of other Instructor objects.p  pThe best option Ive been able to come up with is place a viewmodel computed observable that is the sum of all instructor teaching percentages, and validate that value as being 100.p  pAm I missing something  Is this a wise way to go about this situation  Broadly speaking, this question applies to any situation in which you have multiple model objects, and the validity of one of their properties is mutually dependent on properties on other objects.  p  pE.g., ObjA.Heading is valid if it is a positive number, emandem ObjB.Heading is also positive and the reverse is also true ObjB.Heading is valid if it is a positive number, emandem ObjA.Heading is also positive.p  pThanks for any input on how to handle this kind of situation.p  pThanksp
Negative 33953 pI have a very simple objective that Im trying to accomplish with the use of jQuery. I have 6 trigger divs that add selected classes to corresponding paragraphs. Its currently set up and working so that when you hover over codedivcode 1, codeparagraphcode 1 gets a class toggled.

So it should not happen by computing interpolations via loop or something like that, but instead just on the graph.p  pSince the dataset has multiple columns and I am currently using Rs matplot function to visualize it, there should be a way to add multiple NAadjusted lines as in matpot or lines for example.

Negative 33953 pI am trying to use SVM for a text classification problem. I have found an SVM implementation called SVM light and its derivative SVM multiclass for classification problems with more than 2 classes. However I am really not able to understand the format of the file for training and testing the classifier. I understand that I need to create a feature vector let us assume that I take each word in the document as a feature and then for each document I have to specify its class, the features it contains actually the index of the feature in the feature vector and a feature value to create the train file. I am confused about this feature value. What could it possibly be Is it the count of that feature in this document Or is it something else The example train file that the website contains do not have integers as feature values which indicates that it is not the frequency which would form the feature valuep  pAlso I was wondering if there is some toolsoftware to create this train file from a simple document. I generally work with Java so some package in Java to do this would also be good enough for me. I tried searching the Google but could not find anything relevant.p  pI would also like to know if there is some other better way to use SVM for text classification.p  pAny help in this regard would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 33953 pI am new to Spring Batch and have just begun to conduct a POC to prove that Spring Batch is capable of processing 1m records in a hour. The architecture however demands that we demonstrate horizontally scalablity as well.p  pI have read through both the Partitoning and Remote Chunking strategies. Both make sense to me. The essential difference between the two is that Remote Chunking requires a durable message queue as the actual write out to the database or file happens from the master. In partioning a durable message queue is not needed as the write happens from the slave.p  pWhere I am totally lost however is, how to ensure that the results of these 2 variants of parallel processing are written out in the correct sequence . p  pLets take partinioning for example. As far as I understand if a particular step dealing with 1000 records is partioned into 10 parallel step executions each having its own Reader,Processor and Writer, one of the executions could easily complete before the other. The result is that the ItemWriter of one of the step executions could write the results of processing records 300400 to a table before results of processing 200300 are written out to the same table, as that particular step execution could be lagging behind. p  pWhat this means is that now I have a output table which does have all results of the processing but they are not in the correct sorted order. A further round of sequential processing may be required just bring them back to the correct sorted order of 1 through to 1000.p  pI am struggling to understand, how I can ensure correct sorted output and at the same time scale the system horizontally through the remote processing strategies described in Spring Batch.p  pI have read both these books. a hrefhttpwww.manning.comtemplier relnofollowhttpwww.manning.comtempliera as well as a hrefhttpwww.apress.com9781430234524 relnofollowhttpwww.apress.com9781430234524a but there is nothing in those books either that answer my question.p  pWith Regards Swapnonil Mukherjeep

So most of the existing APIs looked like this ok, not always that stupid p  precodepublic class DummyApi       private final DataSource datasource      public DummyApijavax.sql.DataSource datasource          this.datasource  datasource            public void doSomething throws SQLException           Connection connection  datasource.getConnection          PreparedStatement statement  connection.prepareStatementplain sql query          statement.execute       codepre  pUsing such APIs is simple, it doesnt matter if your endapplication is plain java SE, spring or javaEE. Further, transactionAPIs works proper with this APIs. We use them with spring TransactionManager together with the TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy and with JTA in CMAJava EE applications.p  pNow we evaluate to use JPA in new APIs. And the big question we currently struggle is the following how can we provide a simple interface so that the endapplication doesnt need to know about JPA How can we initialize the EntityManager with a DataSource for example provided as constructor parameter And how can we rollback if there are old, plain JDBCAPIs AND new JPAAPIs in the same transaction beginrollback in the endapplicationp  pThanks for bringing a little light on the matterp

Negative 33953 pRubygems doesnt provide a proper way to specify different dependencies for different ruby versions. If we put a conditional in the gemspec, it can switch what gets installedp  precodeif RUBYVERSION lt 1.9    ruby 1.8 only supports nokogiri lt 1.6   s.runtimedependency nokogiri, gt 1.4.0, lt 1.6 else   s.runtimedependency nokogiri, gt 1.4.0 end codepre  pBut, this doesnt control what gets emloadedem. If theres a newer version in the load path, that would get loaded even if its incompatible with ruby 1.8.p  pIm not sure if this is actually a problem If youre using rbenvrvm etc. then you have different gem paths for each ruby, so hopefully youd never have both installed in the same place. I think even the standard gem paths are divided by compatibility versions 1.8  1.9.1. Is that intended to take care of this, or could you ever get into a situation where both versions are installed togetherp  pThe other approach would be to leave the gemspec openended without the conditional, and warn users to set the correct version constraint in their Gemfile if they need it.p  pWhich way is preferablep

Negative 33953 pAt the moment, my usual approach to supporting righttoleft RTL languages in a template is to simply add a code.rtlcode class to the codebodycode tag, then go through all my existing lefttoright CSS and add leftright overrides as appropriate.p  pFor example, my site menu might be positioned like so by default as belowp  precode.sitenav    position absolute   left 0   top 0  codepre  p...and then manually overridden for RTL languages this way using some template logic at a CMS level to add the code.rtlcode class to codebodycodep  precode.rtl .sitenav    left auto   right 0  codepre  pMy issue is that this seems labourintensive and not very effecient.

Negative 33953 pLooking for a way for Javascript and Actionscript to share one copy of data in memory in a Flex Mobile app.  Read on.p  pIm building a Flex app where a portion of it is implemented in HTMLJavascript.  In the browser, the SWF lives on the main page, and the HTML portion lives in an iframe, on that same page.p  pThese two parts share about 1.5 MBytes of JSON data in the following way.  The outermost page loads the data once, and defines a function that provides access to the loaded data.  The Actionscript code uses ExternalInterface to call this function, and the HTMLJavascript code calls this function through its parent which is the outer page.  Its my assumption that both paths are accessing the same memory, and that Im not actually marshalling data back and forth.p  pFor the Flex Mobile version of this app, Im using StageWebView to render the HTML part, which works well. But I dont know how I can share data between the two sides.p  pPlease note, Ive looked at StageWebViewBridge, and Ill give it another look.  But at a quick glance it looks like pushing data around, not like actual memory sharing.  Am I wrongp

Theres a database connection that is created in the constructor of the bean because i have several methods in this bean that readwrite to the database, so i dont want to open a new connection everytime.

Negative 33953 pI currently have two stored procedures that are meant to do the same thing. I was given two ideas on how to retrieve a fairly complex set of data, so I wrote them both and now I need to determine which one is more efficient. p  pI have tried using Sql Profiler, client statistics, and reviewing Execution Plans, but the results appear inconclusive. Which of the two stored procs that executes more quickly changes from execution to execution. p  pI am guessing the buffer cache, statistics, and network traffic are causing the fluctuation in results. I can run the same stored proc 10 times in a row and get very different Durations somewhere between 900ms and 1400ms. I know thats not THAT big, but it makes my decision more difficult. p  pI know I can clear the buffer cache and reset the statistics, but I am working with a dev server that is used pretty frequently by others. I dont want to slow them down with my shenanigans.p  pThe amount of data I am working with is certainly smaller than it will be in production, so it would probably help to dummy up a realistic amount of data.p  pWhat I am wondering is whether or not there is a nice way to run these two queries and determine which performs better. Maybe some software that will run each query 100 times and generate a nice chart or something I dont want to totally remove statistics and cache from the equation because those will be in play in the production. p  pIf it turns out that the queries are fairly interchangeable, Ill ask a follow up question about which one is theoretically more efficient.p  pThanksp  pstrongUPDATEstrong Okay, looks like I need to add more data and then get back to you. Maybe that is all I need to do. Also going to take the time to read Dalorzos post. I will let you know if the results stabilize with a more realistic test.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Oh yeah, it became much more conclusive when I added more data. One of the stored procs barely changed when I added more data, the other one took about 3x as long. Thanks everyone I figured more data would help but was hoping there was a way that didnt involve cramming a bunch of stuff in to the DB. Much appreciated.p

Negative 33953 pImagine a social photo app like Instagram. You see one of your friends photos in your feed. That photo is persisted in CoreData as something like thisp  precodePhoto NSManagedObject  Attributes id, imageURL  Relationships comments set of Comment objects, likes set of Like objects codepre  pI have a view controller that has a reference to the Photo object. This view controller also handles actions for liking and commenting on the photo.p  pSo, when someone likes a photo the flow is this Send the like to the server. If the API post is successful, update the Photo object in CoreData with any new information received from the server, which will include the new like. At this point the Photo should have one more Like object related to it in CoreData than before I pressed the like button.p  pNow here is where Im having a problem. The view controller needs to update the number of likes on the photo. In a success block, Im doing thisp  precode  self.likesLabel.text  [NSString stringWithFormatd likes, self.photo.likes.count] codepre  pThe problem is that self.photo.likes.count is reporting 0 at this point it was nonzero before I pressed the like button. If I navigate elsewhere and come back to this screen, the count will update properly. So it seems that the Photo managedObject becomes dirty when I update it. The update probably happens in another context I use Magical Record. The update looks something like thisp  precodeNSManagedObjectContext context  [NSManagedObjectContext MRcontextForCurrentThread] Photo photo  [Photo MRfindFirstWithPredicatesomePredicate inContextcontext] ... photo.likes  likes photo.comments  comments [photo savecontext] codepre  pSo the question is, how do I properly keep the Photo object updated in the view controller so that I can always reliably query the number of likes and comments In general, how can you always keep a fresh version of an NSMangagedObject, given that it may be updated in other threadscontextsp  pI have tried listening for the NSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChangeNotification, but I run into the same problem where the Photo reports 0 likes and comments when I get that notification.p

Negative 33953 pI had been tasked with writing a script that takes two ini files and merges them, one being the original and the second and more authoritative one being the change file. So basically anything thats new in the change file gets added, and anything thats a duplicate gets changed. And it works.... but not really how I expected. p  pI basically decided to do a diff on the sections using a list, and then iterate over that list and add in the deltas, but the behavior Im seeing is hard for me to explain. Currently if there are no section changes nothing gets changed, that makes sense since you cant iterate over a list of nothing. However if even one new section gets added it merges all the option values from all over the other sections, changed or not. Which in a nut shell is what I want but I dont understand why, except for the fact that no new sections are present in the change file youd have to add just a dummy entry to get it to actually parse. p  pHeres my codep  precodeusrbinenv python Import Config Parser and modules, sys can be removed Id like to keep it for debugging for future versions  from ConfigParser import SafeConfigParser import sys, argparse    Voyager Parser                Written March 2014            Clifford Trueman               NAME   voyagerparser VERSION0.1 USAGE  .voyagerparser i ltinputfilegt c ltchangefilegt o ltoutputfilegt SUMMARYScript to merge changes from PCE and GOI   parsecli  argparse.ArgumentParserdescriptionvoyagerparser To read in and merge GOI and PCE change inis parsecli.addargumenti, input, helpInput original GOI file name,requiredTrue parsecli.addargumentc, change, helpInput PCE derived ini file for changes,requiredTrue parsecli.addargumento, output, helpOutput, requiredTrue   Define our global variables Define two parsers so we can work with multiple files args          parsecli.parseargs parser        SafeConfigParser parser2       SafeConfigParser list1         [] list2         [] inputfile1   args.input inputfile2   args.change outputfile   args.output     Define our Functions    Figuring out section diffs, Source  change files input and change file order matters def readfilesectionsinputfile, comparelist     parser.readinputfile     for merge in parser.sections         comparelist.appendmerge     return comparelist  Take what we found to be different then add it def adddeltasectionsdeltalist, outputfile     for delta in deltalist         parser2.addsectiondelta         parser.writesys.stdoutcomment in for debugging         parser.writeopenoutputfile, w     return     Call our functions    get a list of the sections in both ini files  readfilesectionsinputfile1, list1 readfilesectionsinputfile2, list2  Find out what that difference is deltalist  listsetlist2setlist1 print deltalist Call this to add in the changes we found adddeltasectionsdeltalist, outputfile   name  main codepre

Negative 33953 pI have a set of data. They are distributed in xy positions but they have other characteristics like size. I like to grid my data in xy plane and then obtain the grid index for each point and then compute the mean or standard deviation of size in each grid cell. I would like to see whether there is a correlation with the position in xy plane with the size or not. The old fashion way is to write two loops and make a 3D matrix to keep the index of data in each cell. I am wondering whether there is a class in numpy or python which does thisp  pI know I can use codenp.histogram2dcode but it just returns the number of points in each grid but not the index of array in each point or codematplotlib.mlab.griddatacode somehow interpolate between the grid cells but I dont want any interpolation.

Negative 33953 pFirst of all, I should say that this is a WordPress based question, which I originally asked on the WordPress StackExchange, a hrefhttpwordpress.stackexchange.comquestions139815replaceallofpostsimageurlswithuploaddirectoryurlsherea. But I think its turned into a more PHPbased question so thats why Im asking here.p  pSo basically, Ive written this codepregreplacecallbackcode function, which, on savingpublishing the post, will replace all of the image URLs with URLs from the WP Uploads directory. Ive had fleeting success with this sometimes it works, but only on one of the URLs in my test examples on my site I have 3 codeimgcode tags, each split up with paragraphs. p  pHere is my codep  precodeaddfiltercontentsavepre, getpostimgs  contentsavepre filter may be depreceated gt httpadambrown.infopwphookshookcontentsavepre  function getpostimgs      global post      postContent  postgtpostcontent      content  pregreplacecallback         ltimg.src[][][].gti,  pattern to match to i.e the contents of an ltimg src... gt tag         function match              imgURL  match[1]  the second array 1 0based is the array with the URLs in. First array 0 has the whole img tag in.              imagedata  filegetcontentsimgURL  Get image data             filename    basenameimgURL .  . postgtID . .jpg  Create image file name              if wpmkdirp uploaddir[path]     check upload file exists and the permissions on it are correct                 file  uploaddir[path] .  . filename              else                  file  uploaddir[basedir] .  . filename               save file to server              fileputcontents file, imagedata   save the file to the server              return file         ,         postContent           return content  codepre  pIve added some comments along the way to hopefully explain what Im doing at each stage. Im not a PHP wizard I mainly do WordPress PHP so be nice Also, as I put in the comments, the WordPress filter Im using, codecontentsaveprecode, which is supposed to edit the content before being saved to the database, has been a hrefhttpadambrown.infopwphookshookcontentsavepre relnofollowdepreciateda. But thats a WordPress issue, so Ill consult the guys on the WordPress Stackexchange about that one. p  pAnyway, my main problem is that when I hit save, the content is completely wiped. As I said above, Ive had fleeting success  sometimes it will replace maybe one of the URLs, other times it wont, and most of the time it simply wipes all the content. Im assuming theres something wrong with the codepregreplacecallbackcode. p  pLastly as you may have seen from the link I posted to the Wordpress StackExchange right at the top, I originally coded this up by using a codepregmatchallcode to find all the image URLs, then used a codeforeachcode loop to go through the array of URLs and had a codepreyreplacecode to replace the URLs. That code is a hrefhttpwordpress.stackexchange.comquestions139815replaceallofpostsimageurlswithuploaddirectoryurlsherea if you want to take a look at that. I changed it based on the advice on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5053333phpreturnpregreplaceinsideofforeachthis threada correct answer. But both methods act pretty much the same.p  pThanks for any help  p  pEDIT Ive updated my code a little, made a few silly mistakes regarding global variablesvariable scope and a few syntaxWP errors.

Negative 33953 pI am creating a simple little popup view, similar to the popup that appears when you push the volume buttons. I would like to display an instance of that popup view in different view controllers. I have been pondering a couple approaches, but I would like to know what is the best approach, taking into account MVC, complexity, and otherwise good practices.p  pCurrently, I am creating and displaying this UIView from within my UIViewController. I justified that approach since its really a small view and I do a lot of work with it to modify its behavior in that VC, so that code was already going to be in the VC. Essentially, I make a frame, set the background, apply corner radius, add text to it, apply motion effects, then make it fade in then later fade out. I could copy and paste the code into my other VCs but thats obviously a bad approach.p  pI could create a subclass of UIView and Im sure I could use drawRect to draw it, but Im not sure exactly how to add that view to the VC exactly in the middle, unless I drag out a view to my VCs and change its class. But if I do that I can do most everything in Interface Builder anyways, which would be preferred especially if I can use Auto Layout to always keep it centered. But, Id need to copy and paste that UIView into each VC and hide it  that doesnt sound good.p  pI could create a subclass of UIView and instead of drawing with drawRect, implement a method that creates the UIView and returns it. Then in the VCs I just call that method and add the view it returns as a subview. Ive never done this, and Im not sure if thats an appropriate approach.p  pWhat is a plausible approach to implementing such a view that can be thrown on screen from any of my VCs Thanksp  pNote that this view should always be the same size, in the center of the screen, not tied to any specific VC. It should remain on screen unaffected by transitions and such. It closely mimics the Volume popup.p

Negative 33953 pI have a large number of stored procedures 200 that all collect clinical data and insert the result into a common table. Each stored procedure accepts the same single parameter, codeClientIDcode, and then compiles a list of diagnostic results and inserts them into a master table. p  pI have each clinical test separated into individual stored procedures however as I described in a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23062561sqlserverstoredproceduresslowvsgiantscriptprevious SO questiona, the execution of the batch of these stored procedures pegs the CPU at 100 and continues on for hours before eventually failing. This leads me to want to create a single script that contains all the functionality of the stored procedures. Why you ask Well, because it works. I would prefer to keep the logic in the stored procedure but until I can figure out why the stored procedures are so slow, and failing, I need to proceed with the script method.p  pSo, what I am looking to do is to take all the stored procedures and find a way to script their functionality out to a single SQL script.

Negative 33953 pIm currently developing a App thats home view controller shows a display of all the users friends, their names and their profile images if they have one, each within a cell of a  UICollectionView. I am using tags to identify the UI elements within each cell and Parse as the backend. Each user and their relations are stored under the class User and then their profile images if they have chosen onetaken one are stored under another class called UserImage. Ive managed to set their usernames to the cells but having difficulty with the images.

Negative 33953 pWhy is the header of my website behaving differently on Chrome then Firefoxp  pOn my homepage the header is flush with the background but on other pages it seems chrome invokes extra margin or padding from the top.p  pIn Firefox everything is the same. If I make changes to the top margin of header it fixes all pages on Firefox. If I do this then in Chrome, only on the homepage, it is not correct.

What is the best way of doing this Should I define another constructor in each class without input argument like below, or there is any better way of doing this Is there any way I can use the existing constructor like in above to define instances of class1 in class2 and vice versap  pClass1p  precodeusing WinFormApp1 class Class1      private Form1 Frm1      public Class1      public Class1Form1 parent              Frm1  parent       codepre

Negative 33953 pIm having a few issues implementing my fullCalendar example since Im a noob to javascript, jquery and the fullcalendar itself. The short summary My project struture is the index html which gets the js libraries I need and has only a div containing the fullcalendar, a calendar.js file where I keep my fullcalendar configurations and where I get the events from an external source and the localstorage and finally an events.js file where I implement event creation through selecting time blocks and store them to the localstorage. The files SHOULD be separated like this, in order to keep the code for options and the code for the selecting and storing separated, organized and clean. Also the google calendar events are also meant to be an alternate event source to the locally stored ones.p  pSo here are my issues numberedp  ol liThe select callback from events.js doesnt work I have tried it with    document.ready as well if it is in that separate file while it    is included in just one it works fine as expected.

Negative 33953 pWe have a web application that copies files to a remote server within our domain strongOurDomainstrong. The following issue occurs with users that log on to their laptop with another domain, and then log on to the web application with strongOurDomainstrong. Users that log on to both the laptop and web application with strongOurDomainUserstrong dont have this problem.p  pWe have two webformsp  pThe 1st webform retrieves the users ID using codeSystem.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity.GetCurrentcode and then sends an email with this userid. This code retrieves the users ID only if we have codeWindows Authenticationcode set to codeEnabledcode and codeASP.Net Impersonationcode also set to codeEnabledcode. If codeASP.Net Impersonationcode is set to codeDisabledcode, the user will be codeNetwork Servicecode. So I set both to Enabled and everything here works great.p  pThe 2nd webform copies some files to the remote server, also under the domain strongOurDomainstrong. With codeWindows Authenticationcode set to codeEnabledcode and codeASP.Net Impersonationcode set to codeDisabledcode, then codeNetwork Servicecode is used to copy the files to the remote server and are copied correctly. On the other hand, If codeASP.Net Impersonationcode is set to codeEnabledcode, it seems to bypass codeNetwork Servicecode and even strongOurDomainUserstrong and tries to copy with, apparently, the credentials used to log on to the laptop Another domain. The files dont copy and I get error emAccess to the path is deniedemp  pThe only fix Ive found is to add strongOurDomainUserstrong to the folder, and its really not a big deal, but I wanted to see why this was happening.p  pThanks.p

Negative 33953 pFor quite a while now I have been fighting to create a socket that behaves in the intended way. As an example I have created the following simple swing program to represent the problem.p  pWhen ran, a user enters a number into the textfield and presses the post button. A socket is then created and the score the number entered gets taken to the server program which performs a method called leaderboard. Depending on the number entered and how many entries are made, a result would be given in the form of a string called rank, which is where my problem begins...p  pNo matter what code I write, what order the code is in, I just cannot get the server to return the string rank and set string rank as the text of JLabel l2 in the client program.p  pI am very new to socket programming, and I am sure that I have probably missed some important lines.

Negative 33953 pI have a test array which contains strings. I also have two functions, replaceOverlap that merges two overlapped strings and findNested that finds if one of the two strings is a substring from the other. The code is in PHPp  pWhat I would like to do is to iterate over the test array and take each element epitope and compare it with the rest of the epitopes in the array one at a time, as there are some more rules in the algorithm. The issue is that if I only want to print the biggest overlappednested string found across the rest of the test array, and then delete from the array those string that have been merged. This is the code I have so far. Any help will be very appreciated.p  precodetestarrayAVNIVGYSNAQGVDY,DIKYTWNVPKI,DIKYTWNVPKIA,DIKYTWNVPKIAPKSEN,GCHGSEPCIIHRGK,IDGLEVDVPGIDPNAC,IGIKDLRAFQHYDGRTI,IIHRGKPFQLEAV,IKYTWNVPKIAPKSEN,KPFQLEAVFEANQNT,LRQMRTVTPIRMQGG,NFLESLKYVEANKGAIN,PCIIHRGKPFQLEAV,PLVKGQQYDIKYTWNVP,QQYDIKYTWNVPKI,QQYDIKYTWNVPKIA,QQYDIKYTWNVPKIAP,QQYDIKYTWNVPKIAPK,QQYDIKYTWNVPKIAPKS,QQYDIKYTWNVPKIAPKSE,QQYDIKYTWNVPKIAPKSEN,QYDIKYTWNVPK,QYDIKYTWNVPKI,QYDIKYTWNVPKIAPKS,QYDIKYTWNVPKIAPKSEN,RFGISNYCQIYPPNV,SAYLAHRNQSLDLAEQELVDCAS,TAIAVIIGIKDLRAFQH,TWNVPKIAPKSENVVVT,YAYVAREQSCR,YDIKYTWNVPK,YDIKYTWNVPKI,YDIKYTWNVPKIA,YDIKYTWNVPKIAPKSEN  i0 foreach test as epitope     str1epitope     for j  i j lt counttest j          str2test[j]         value1  replaceOverlapstr1,str2         value2  replaceOverlapstr2,str1         value3  findNestedstr1,str2         if replaceOverlapstr1,str2false             arraysplicetest[j]             print value1echoltbrgt                  elseif replaceOverlapstr2,str1false             arraysplicetest[j]             print value2echoltbrgt                  elseif findNestedstr1,str2false             arraysplicetest[j]             print value3echoltbrgt                   ii1  codepre

Negative 33953 pI have a number of functions that return a future that is the result of a for comprehension, but i need to need to recover from some possible failures on the way out.

Negative 33953 pI am maintaining an existing Java product which has a HUGE codebase. I discovered that it is setting and getting two of its internal passwords as Java system properties, at no less than 45 different places methods. Now, the problem is, the passwords are being stored as plain text in the Java system properties, and so, the same is visible to external entities, as the application is not using any Java Security Manager. For example, if the application process is running on port number 1234, we can run the Java commandp  pjinfo sysprops 1234p  pto view both the passwords as values of the corresponding Java system properties. I wish to ask if there is any remedy to this without changing the existing codebase too much The desired effect would be to hide the two Java system properties denoting the two passwords from all external entities.p  pIt may be noted that introducing a Java Security Manager into the application may not be a solution, as if we revoke read permissions from the said two Java system properties using the Java Security Manager, the application codes which read those properties would crash. Same is applicable for storing the passwords in encrypted form, as that would crash all codes within the application which are expecting to read the passwords in clear text form.p

Negative 33953 pI hope the question is not trivial, I spent a decent amount of time looking for an answer around.  I am creating an ontology in OWL and Ive been trying to enforce a particular constraint into a class description but not being able to do it with the tools provided by OWL and resorted to blank nodes as existential variables in the description of the class. Protege5 did not like it a bit.  Id like to model classes of spaces and movements from one space to another, and in particular Id like to model a movement that has as a target the same space as the starting space.  In logic Id describe my InternalMovement class asp  precodeInternalMovement  forall x exist y Movementx  spacex,y  directionx,y codepre  pIn OWL variables do not exist and enforcing the identity of a blank nodes throughout a class description doesnt seem possible. I resorted to blank nodes because they should be treated as existential variables and I hope using blank nodes ids would do the trick. I was wrong and I dont know how to model this simple class.  The Turtle snippet is thisp  precodeMovement rdftype owlClass .

Negative 33953 pI have a Single Page Web Application built with Durandal and Breeze 1.5 client talking to Aspnet Web API OData services which in turn uses Entity Framework 5 to access a SQL Server database.p  pThe OData services use v3.0 of the OData protocolp  pThe issue I have is with getting concurrency checks to happen, the EF module makes use of model properties which, in the mapping, are identified as optimistic concurrency tokensp  pThe problem occurs when an entity on the client has one or more properties updated and then saved via Breeze  it sends the update as a HTTP PATCH operation including only the properties that have been updated  this does not include the original value of the column used as a concurrency token and so any concurrency error is not identified when the EF context calls save changes.p  pHow can I configure Breeze to send updates via the PUT verb including the complete entity or get it to always include the original value of the concurrency columnp
Negative 33953 pIn the simplified code below I have hard coded the first row to span all three columns of a TableView.p  pIt seems to work well apart from selection. If I have the first row selected and press right, the selection goes to the cell with a width of zero and so seems to disappear. Likewise, if the middle cell of the second row is selected and up is pressed, the selection goes to the same hidden cell.p  pIs there anyway of telling the selection model that certain cells should be ignored Or is it more likely I have to write a selection model from scratchp  precodeimport com.sun.javafx.scene.control.skin.TableRowSkin import javafx.application.Application import

Negative 33953 pIm using gulprubysass to compile my css and generate source maps for a site built on Jekyll. The source maps are being generated. When I inspect a style, a Sass partial is identified as the source of that style. But when I click on the filename, Im taken to an empty window. I need my entire codescsscode directory copied into the codesitecode directory when the site is generated. But Jekyll ignores all files prefixed with an underscore, so all Sass partials are automatically excluded. Ive tried adding, codescsscode, codescsssasspartial.scsscode, and codescss.scsscode to the codeincludecode property of Jekylls codeconfig.ymlcode. This property is supposed to force inclusion of files that would otherwise be automatically excluded such as code.htaccesscode. But this does not work for my Sass partials. Jekyll includes the partials only if the underscore is removed. Does anyone know a way of dealing with thisp
Negative 33953 pI know that I can route to coderouter.getobjectid, ...code, coderouter.postobjectnew, ...code, coderouter.deleteobjectid, ...code, and coderouter.putobjectid, ...code and that when I browse to a specific object, the browser will issue a http get request. And I understand that I can post info through a form. But how can I implement the codeDELETEcode and codePUTcode methods so that I can edit and delete objects How do I specify the method used in the route Do I have to change the route so that it is unique ie, coderouter.getobjectdeleteid, ...code and coderouter.getobjecteditid, ...code and just use get methodsp

Negative 33953 pI am using EF 5, Model First, on .NET 4.5 with Win Server 2012 and SQL Server Express 2008 R2. p  pThere are basically three main components in my app p  ol liData Acquisition on ModbusTCPli liReporting and li liREST interface. li ol  pI also implemented a scheduler class to basically have other classes schedule some operations e.g. data acquisition and reporting. p  pData acquisitions polling executes at every 5 seconds and writes data to a table in the DB. This works fine, no problem here. p  pThe reporting gets invoked at every 24 hours, at midnight and it retrieves data from database and generates spreadsheet and emails it. At midnight, when the event fires, in the event handlers using block for codeDbContextcode, there are no data retrieved from database. However, if I manually call the event handler from other method, the very same using blocks DbContext has all the data.p  pI cannot find what the problem is with it when the handler invoked from event. I have tried to use codeTranscationScopecode on the data acquisition write operation to allow codeRepetitiveReadcode but this worsened the problem. I removed the codeTransactionScopecode around the write operation.p  pPlease suggest any ways to narrow down my investigation and solving the problem.p  pThanks in advance.p

Cached data becomes out of date or stale   when a transaction modifies the data and commits, thereby putting the   application at risk of accessing incorrect results. If the application   uses Database Change Notification, then Oracle Database can publish a   notification when a change occurs to registered objects with details   on what changed.p      pIn response to the notification, the application can refresh cached   data by fetching it from the backend database.p blockquote

Negative 33953 pim scratching my head with this one, I can do the usual contents of div  contents of another div addition in jquery, but im not sure how I go about adding together the contents of all instances of a particular span on a page. Basically I can a page that pulls info into it using jquery and ajax, it pulls in invoices for the month selected and displays them in each row. What I want to do is add off the the rows together with the class grandtotal, so I can display the monthly invoice total for all the invoices for that month, but im not sure how to add grandtotal  grandtotal etc when I dont know how many instances of that span are going to be generated each time, I somehow need to take the number from each instance of grandtotal currently on the page and then display it in a div monthlytotal .

Negative 33953 pI have this link a hrefhttpappflood.go2cloud.orgaffcofferid1724ampaffid2593 relnofollowhttpappflood.go2cloud.orgaffcofferid1724ampaffid2593ap  pIt provides redirect on any browser in Android Internal, Chrome, Firefox. But it does not redirect on desktop browsers.p  pAnd this link CANT be fooled So if I change useragent in my desktop Firefox to the string EXACTLY matching with mobile phone string, I cant get redirect. Also if I switch ANY of my mobile browser to desktop mode, I am still being redirected. I can fool ANY of common mobile detecting methods by changing UserAgent. But I cant fool this link.p  pSo I suppose that the redirecting is based not on parsing UserAgent only. Please note that I use my mobile phone with wifi, which connected to my router. So the phone have same external IP with my desktop computer. it is regarding version of detecting IPs of wireless ISP.p  pSo, the question is how this redirect works and how can I implement the similar.p
Negative 33953 pFirst of all, let me know if this is a duplicate so I can delete it. I couldnt find anything similar but I may be searching with the wrong keywords.p  pHeres my issue If you use the imagepicker to start the camera to take a picture, you get the default live view of what the camera sees, and you have the default shutter button and cancel button, along with extra camera buttons at the top. So far no issues with that.p  pWhat I want to know is what the size is of this live view before I take a picture. I have the size of the image and all of that, but in order to create a properly formatted overlay just over the live view I need to know where the live view starts and where it ends.p  pAny idea how to get the size of this viewp  pLet me know if you need some of my existing code. Thanks.p

Negative 33953 pIm developing an App and I want to have a Share button that allows users to pick an app from a list that they can share from, which then opens up that app or some sort of dialog that lets them tweet, post, text message, etc.p  pIve achieved this on my Android app because it is extremely simple there to create an ACTIONSEND intent, and filter based on certain mimetypes for what apps to share with.p  pI want something similar with iOS8 and Swift but I cant find anywhere how to achieve this.p  pI dont want to have buttons in my app for sharing with Twitter, or sharing with Facebook, or ...

Negative 33953 pI have observed that when a method of certain class is marked as codefinalcode in C11, there is no lookup in the vtable to call that method, even from pointers, at least with the assembly produced by GCC. Let this code serve as examplep  precodeclass Base  public     Base  retval0      virtual Base     virtual int method          return retval      protected     uint32t retval   class DerivedFinal  public Base  public     int method final          return retval  2        int main      Base bptr  new Base     DerivedFinal df  staticcastltDerivedFinal gtbptr     return dfgtmethod  codepre  pPlease note that the code uses return value like this to make the assembly code easily readable.p  pThe assembly of main looks like thisp  precodelt0gt     push   rbp lt1gt     mov    rsp,rbp lt4gt     push   rbx lt5gt     sub    0x18,rsp lt9gt     mov    0x10,edi lt14gt    callq  0x400750 ltZnwmpltgt lt19gt    mov    rax,rbx lt22gt    mov    rbx,rdi lt25gt    callq  0x400900 ltZN4BaseC2Evgt lt30gt    mov    rbx,0x18rbp lt34gt    mov    0x18rbp,rax lt38gt    mov    rax,0x20rbp lt42gt    mov    0x20rbp,rax lt46gt    mov    rax,rdi lt49gt    callq  0x400986 ltZN12DerivedFinal6methodEvgt  This is the method call lt54gt    add    0x18,rsp lt58gt    pop    rbx lt59gt    pop    rbp lt60gt    retq codepre  pAs it can be seen, the method is called without any vtable lookup this does not happen if the method is not marked final. The code behaves the same way even if there are classes that inherit from codeDerivedFinalcode My question here is... is this standard behaviorp  hr  pstrongEDITstrong Lets rewrite the code in such way that is not undefined behavior, to explicitly show how the vtable is skipped when the method is final, and it is looked up when it is notp  precodeclass Base  public     Base  retval0      virtual Base     virtual int method          return retval      protected     uint32t retval   class DerivedFinal  public Base  public     int method final          return retval  2        class DerivedNotFinal  public Base  public     int method          return retval  3        int main      DerivedFinal df  new DerivedFinal     DerivedNotFinal dnf  new DerivedNotFinal     int resfinal  dfgtmethod     int resnotfinal  dnfgtmethod     return 0  codepre  pAnd the assembly dumpp  precodelt0gt     push   rbp lt1gt     mov    rsp,rbp lt4gt     push   rbx lt5gt     sub    0x28,rsp lt9gt     mov    0x10,edi lt14gt    callq  0x4007b0 ltZnwmpltgt lt19gt    mov    rax,rbx lt22gt    movq   0x0,rbx lt29gt    movl   0x0,0x8rbx lt36gt    mov    rbx,rdi lt39gt    callq  0x400a5c ltZN12DerivedFinalC2Evgt  First ctor... lt44gt    mov    rbx,0x18rbp lt48gt    mov    0x10,edi lt53gt    callq  0x4007b0 ltZnwmpltgt lt58gt    mov    rax,rbx lt61gt    movq   0x0,rbx lt68gt    movl   0x0,0x8rbx lt75gt    mov    rbx,rdi lt78gt    callq  0x400a82 ltZN15DerivedNotFinalC2Evgt  Second ctor... lt83gt    mov    rbx,0x20rbp lt87gt    mov    0x18rbp,rax lt91gt    mov    rax,rdi lt94gt    callq  0x400a34 ltZN12DerivedFinal6methodEvgt  Call to DerivedFinalmethod directly lt99gt    mov    eax,0x24rbp  Save result in stack lt102gt   mov    0x20rbp,rax lt106gt   mov    rax,rax lt109gt   add    0x10,rax lt113gt   mov    rax,rax lt116gt   mov    0x20rbp,rdx lt120gt   mov    rdx,rdi lt123gt   callq  rax  Call to DerivedNotFinalmethod via vtable indirect call lt125gt   mov    eax,0x28rbp  Save result in stack lt128gt   mov    0x0,eax lt133gt   add    0x28,rsp lt137gt   pop    rbx lt138gt   pop    rbp lt139gt   retq codepre  pWith this example the behavior is also clear. The call to DerivedFinalmethod does not require any vtable lookup, while the call to DerivedNotFinalmethod requires an indirection. In my opinion, this behavior with the final keyword is desired in certain performancecritical applications, which is why I ask if the behavior is standard.p

Negative 33953 pI have a situation where I need to change the Subnet and Gateway for about 170 servers but leave the IP address alone. It seems like this would be simple but the problem is that many of these servers have more than one interface on them so I have to be selective about which one is being changed.p  pLuckily Ive named all my interfaces with a standard convention so I can select the interface I need, however since its Windows 2008r2 Im using WMI.p  pHere is what my problem is To collect information about the interface name I have to use NetConnectionID which is included in Win32NetworkAdapter, but to actually make changes to the interface I have to use Win32NetworkAdapterConfiguration which doesnt include the ability to select the interface based upon the name.p  pSo what I am trying to do us is use the Index property which is in both collections to tie the information together.

The Field stays at None and the Colourspace stays at SRGB.  Then I tried to replace every V4L2PIXFMTBGR24 with V4L2PIXFMTH264 in caplib4vl.cpp and rebuilded OpenCV. When I then ran the .boneCV my two .png images are only black with one or two stripes of white color.p  pTo find out if it is libv4l or OpenCV I ran .capture script that follow Derek Molloys boneCV. It uses libv4l directly and captures an H264 video stream with no problems at all. I then have to use .raw2mpg4 to be able to watch it. The .mp4 file is 1920x1080 at 30 fps with no glitches.

I think it may be because the difference in bits per frame andor colorspace. strongemDo anybody know how to do this or how to make an workaround so that I stil can use OpenCVs VideoCapture functionemstrong p  pI know alot of Raspberry Pi and BeagleboneBlack users would be ever so gratefull if there was any solution to this problem.

I tried to post the links to each of the programs, but I didnt have enough reputation.

Negative 33953 pIm confused with system calls.p  pThe question is Is there a system call service routine, which is always called, in order to find a specific system call, like write, read, etc. p  pAre system calls also stored in a vector of function pointers  Like shown on this picture p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVJ4mY.png altsyscall table titlesyscall tablep  pIf so why there is a possibility to add your own system call and there is no possibility to add your own interrupt handler  Why interruptvector is fixedsize and system call vector not p  pQuote from Silberschatz Operating Systems Conceptsp  blockquote   pA system call usually takes the form of a trap to a specific location in the stronginterrupt vectorstrong. This trap can be executed by a generic trap instruction, although some systems such as MIPS have a specific syscall instruction to invoke a system call.p      pWhen a system call is executed, it is typically treated by the hardware as a software interrupt. Control passes through the stronginterrupt vectorstrong to a service routine in the operating system, and the mode bit is set to kernel mode. The strongsystemcall service routinestrong is a part of the operating system. The kernel examines the interrupting instruction to determine what system call has occurred a parameter indicates what type of service the user program is requesting. Additional information needed for the request may be passed in registers, on the stack, or in memory with pointers to the memory locations passed in registers. The kernel verifies that the parameters are correct and legal, executes the request, and returns control to the instruction following the system call.p blockquote

Negative 33953 pI have a decently popular Chrome extension, and yesterday I accidentally released a corrupted version of it, and didnt catch it for 10 hours. Within those 10 hours, the extension was updated for most users and I lost about half of them over the night based off of my Google Analytics reports I had about 600 pageviews every 30 minutes, and now I only have 285. When I found out about my mistake I quickly reverted to an older version that works, but now, about 30 hours after an update that fixes the corruption, my pageviews are still the same.p  pMy questions arep  ul liHave I lost all those users or has it simply not updated for them yetli liIf an extension is corrupt does it still check for updates or do the users have to press coderepaircodeli ul  pAny insight would be fantastic.

Negative 33953 pI read Intel manual about address calculation in 64 bit mode. Suppose we have 64 bit mode, default address size is 64 bit. Suppose also that instruction in question is preceded by address size override prefix, so address size becomes 32 bit. Now, imagine that instruction encodes memory operand with address specified by register number 0 raxeaxax .... Now the thing that I dont fully understand, whether CPU looks only at eax value and internally zeroextends it to form native 64 bit address or it looks at whole rax value and truncate it to valid 32 bit range for example, rax contains something like 5Gb and CPU cuts it to max 32 bit address. Thanks for your response.p

Negative 33953 pIm building an android app which, although it has a completely different function, has a very similar UI to Instagram. There is a bottom bar with buttons for viewing timeline, posting my apps content, checking notifications, and viewing your own profile.p  pI am a fourth year electrical engineering student, but I am relatively new to Android development. In order to teach myself more stuff faster, I went ahead and made a lot of the functions of my app like viewing posts, profile, timeline, friends, etc. their own activities with their own bottom bar which are just buttons as of now. In doing this I have learned a lot about development and have built an app that, for what I have built out so far, functions as its supposed to, but is not too fast or pretty. I realize this is probably not the best practice and I wanted to ask you all what you think a simple explanation of how to implement an Instagramlike UI would be When I say Instagramlike I mainly mean it includes a bottom bar the app preserves where a user is, like if Im viewing a friend from the timeline, then press the view profile button, then press the timeline again, then I will still be viewing my friend. p  pI have tried to read up as much as I could to tackle the redesign but Im still a little fuzzy on the standard for doing something like this.Should I try TabHost which is deprecated should each button represent an activity with swappable views for example in IG I click a post on my timeline and it swaps to the pictures post view Should I associate an activity with each button and swap fragments based on where the user navigates I realize this is an open ended question, and I hope its not too vague for Stack Overflow, but I have thought about it a great deal, and I would appreciate the feedback of some more experienced developers Thanksp

Negative 33953 pI have a set of userforms which write to a database for ease of data input.

I apologize if this is an obvious solution or if I am not explaining well, I do not know VBA at all I am just learning as I go for a work assignment. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 33953 pI am trying to convert html to pdf using wkhtmltopdf. My html consists mainly of svgs. The svgs are mainly text.p  pWhen an SVG is lengthy, I have the problem, that it creates a lot of empty space in the pdf, for example SVG1 is 12 page and SVG2 is 34 page, then the first page will be half empty. Or if I have an SVG which is longer than one page, it will cut through the text.p  pIs there a way to tell wkhtmltopdf to look for lines in the svg that are only white or empty and break the svg there It doesnt have to be wkhtmltopdf, if another tool or combination of tool is better for the job thats fine.p

Negative 33953 pIm writing a web application with a search function. Im searching for a list of Assets. p  pAn Asset has a Name and a Description. It also has a list of tags associated with it. p  pMy schema looks like this p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comlqsRp.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlqsRp.png altSchemaa My input looks like this many key wordsp  pMy question is whats the best way to search for the assets. Also keeping in mind that there will more than likely be many more fields that need to be searched in the future. p  pMy ideas are the followingp  pstrongIdea 1strongp  pProcedurally create a massive query likep  precode      select         from asset        where id in           select assetid           from assettag           where tagid in              select id             from tags             where name in                 many, key, words                              or concatname, description like many         or concatname, description like key         or concatname, description like words codepre  pThis isnt particularly good as the fields I might need to add more fields to search and I have a feeling when the database starts to get some size this isnt going to work at all.p  pstrongIdea 2strongp  pCreate some sort of indexing system. where I create another table called assetindex with two columns in it. Assetid and text. when an asset gets updated, or tag added I calculate the text field on the assetindex so its a concatenation of all of the things I want to search. so my table will look likep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comSCW9a.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSCW9a.png altasset indexap  pSo my query would be something likep  precodeselect   from asset  where id in      select assetid      from assetindex      where matchtext againstmany key words       or text like many or  text like key or  text like words depending up if I can get the database to support full text searches  codepre  pOr is there a better way 3rd party indexing service p

Negative 33953 pIve made a fairly simple game and Id like to try design a user interface for it since Ive now managed to get a computer player working properly. However, while it seems a 2D grid is easily possible a load of buttons all adjacent to each other, but Im not sure how Id go about an isometric grid thatd allow clicking on the squares.p  pThis is the current way Im showing the grid, where each player puts in a coordinate to move therep  precode                   X        O                  O  X     X                     O  X  O                           O                                      O                   X  X  O X                   O  O                        O                                  X  O                     X  X  O                     O  X                           X                               O                       X  X  X X           O  O            O        X  codepre  pHere is one way Im thinking of having it look, I know its still not ideal for seeing rows on different levels, but I currently cant think of any better way to show it a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comCvRsj.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCvRsj.png altexampleap  pIf it would be possible to design, how would you suggest going about it One idea I had was have the grid as an image, then overlay the squares with transparent pngs which would be generated based on an input colour and symbol, Im thinking make a square, rotate 45, add a letter, and squish, though even if that worked Im still not sure how Id have it recognise user input.p  pFor the record, Im entirely new to user interfaces, I found one for tic tac toe that I can learn the basics off, but a grid of 4x16 buttons would look a bit rubbish, so I ideally need to make something a bit more interesting.p

Negative 33953 pIm wondering whats the way to go for it and I was not able to find anything about it. Maybe I didnt use the right termsp  pLets say I have a project with a main JS file and a CSS one and their respective minified version.  They usually have some credits in the top stating the licence and the version of the library like in Bootstrapp  precode   Bootstrap v3.3.5 httpgetbootstrap.com   Copyright 20112015 Twitter, Inc.   Licensed under MIT httpsgithub.comtwbsbootstrapblobmasterLICENSE   codepre  ul liShould I have the same version number for all the files within the application li liOr a different version number per fileli ul  pIn case of having a group one. Does it make sense to commit a new version of every file when only the .js files have changedp  pIn case I have a different version per file it can lead to confusions for the developers using the library, as it can be announced as Project v2.6.4 and you can find the CSS file with an older version such as v.2.1.2.p
Negative 33953 pIm writing some Hive UDFs, using JNI to talk to a native C library. The C library requires some expensive initialization, and maintains its internal state via a handle. To avoid reinitializing at every row, I initialize the library on the first row, then store the handle as a static variable in the Java world and fetch that for subsequent rows. This is all working fine. p  pThe tough part is that the library also requires you to do cleanup, to release that internal state. Being Java, there are no destructors, of course. And I cant rely on finalize. So I cant figure out where to clean up this library.p  pIs there anything in the Hive  UDF world that will tell my Java code when the query is finished, so that I can cleanup that library Or, is there any Java mechanism that I can use to do thisp  pIm using the UDF class not GenericUDF, but I dont think that matters. I dont see anything in either that looks like a cleanup GenericUDFs close doesnt ever get called, AFAICT.p
Negative 33953 pI am trying to download a file from torcache using webclient. the problem is there is a 5 second timer and it redirects to the same url with the referer header and the browser downloads the file. if I try the same thing in webclient it keeps taking me to the html page rather than giving me the file. p  pif its without timer I think I can use the setting,  wc.request.AllowAutoRedirect  True wc.request.MaximumAutomaticRedirections  1 but that doesnt seem to work here. p  panyone know how to get around this I have been cracking my head for a while now and any help will be appreciated thanks. p

Negative 33953 pI feel like this should be really easy, so Im probably missing something. If my Detail sections Recordset Pattern is Record, how do I access the specific Record node in the Format event for this section I can see all of the Xml from this.DataSource, but I want whichever specific Record node that I am formatting at the given time.p
Negative 33953 pI am trying to link pcre.lib in my metro app on visual studio 2013. I want to use the library in a .cpp file the pcre project contains .c files.  I tried  to build pcre project and use the generated lib file and the original headers. The problem is on compiling, because on each function i use from pcre library it says the next example is for pcrestudy function  error LNK2001 unresolved external symbol imppcrestudy p  pI want to mention that i linked the .lib file correctly and i added all the paths required. Probably the problem is when i am building the pcre project.p  pCan anyone help me  p
Negative 33953 pmy challenge today is to find out how to copy the Doctype of a source document. Ok first that is my sourcep  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingISO88591gt ltDOCTYPE XMLBlock SYSTEM dtdXMLBlock.dtd [ ltENTITY change ltissuegt  ltversiongtVERSION NO 98765432ltversiongt    ltpurposegtlt[CDATA[      Main purpose        to do things        to fix issues ]]gt    ltpurposegt  ltissuegt gt]gt ltXMLBlockgt   ltTitlegtXML StuffltTitlegt   ltContentgtDemoTextltContentgt ltXMLBlockgt codepre  pAs you can see there is an internal entity with a version no, which changes every time. Now I want to catch this number to decide which wrapper is needed. So this is my xsltp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltxslstylesheet xmlnsxslhttpwww.w3.org1999XSLTransform  version1.0gt   ltxsloutput doctypesystemdtdXMLBlock.dtd gt   ltxsltemplate match  gt       ltxslchoosegt         ltxslwhen testampchangeissueversion amplt 9000000gt           ltXMLBlockgt             ltredgt               ltxslcopyof select gt             ltredgt           ltXMLBlockgt         ltxslwhengt         ltxslotherwisegt           ltXMLBlockgt             ltgreengt                ltxslcopyof select gt             ltgreengt           ltXMLBlockgt         ltxslotherwisegt       ltxslchoosegt     ltxsltemplategt   ltxslstylesheetgt codepre  pBut this change isnt resolved because it is not a part of the xslt. So how can I solve the issue, or is it just impossible Kind regardsp  pMarkusp
Negative 33953 pI have created simple app that is warning me, from time to time, to do something. There is a sound that alarms me to do that particular thing and buttons to mark it as done, or to postpone action. It is running in a background normally. When time comes, I can hear a sound, but I cannot see and app in foreground to push buttons. How can I bring application in foreground programmatically instead of clickcin on icon at android desktop I found many samples for java, but how to do it if it is possible in AS3p
