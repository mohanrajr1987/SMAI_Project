Positive 1241 pIm getting unwanted results in Adobe Reader DC when generating or regenerating a multiselection list box with iTextSharp in an Acroform PDF document.p  pProblem The PDF form is missing deselected display items at the beginning of the list box when viewing the modified PDF in Adobe Reader DC. For example One,Two,Three,Four,Five are list items and Two and Four are selected then the previous items such as One are missing the top of the list box. And the first item displayed in the list box starts with the first selection, in this case Two. See Adobe Reader DC Screenshotp  pFYI Using Adobe Reader DC, when I select different field selections in the list box, and then click outside the list box, the list box field reverts back to normal appearance with all the items shown. I cant reproduce this behavior when opening the modified PDF in Adobe Acrobat Professional 8 and all the field items are visible and correctly selected. This missing list items behavior can also be reproduced in GhostScript when converting PDF to BMP or PNG.p  pPlease answer my question Can you please provide me with a resolution to this issue if this is an iTextSharp problem or if my syntax is incorrect. Would you also please let me know if this behavior can reproduced using your Adobe Reader DCp  pThank you for your supportp  pModified Acroform PDF Document with issue a hrefhttpwww.nkinc.comlistboxerror.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.nkinc.comlistboxerror.pdfap  pAdobe Reader DC Screenshot a hrefhttpwww.nkinc.comlistboxerrorreader.gif relnofollowhttpwww.nkinc.comlistboxerrorreader.gifap  precodeADDITIONAL INFORMATION iTextSharp.dll Version 5.5.6.0 Adobe Reader DC Version 2015.008.20082 Adobe Acrobat Pro Version 8.x Form Type Acroform PDF codepre  pVB.NET CODE v3.5  Windows Applicationp  precodeImports iTextSharp.text.pdf Imports iTextSharp.text Imports System.IO Public Class listboxTest     Private Sub RunTest         Dim cList As New listboxTest         Dim fn As String  Application.StartupPath.ToString.TrimEnd amp listboxerror.pdf         Dim b As Byte  cList.addListBoxSystem.IO.File.ReadAllBytesfn, New iTextSharp.text.Rectangle231.67, 108.0, 395.67, 197.0, ListBox1, ListBox1, 1         File.WriteAllBytesfn, b         Process.Startfn     End Sub     Public Function addListBoxByVal pdfBytes As Byte, ByVal newRect As Rectangle, ByVal newFldName As String, ByVal oldfldname As String, ByVal pg As Integer As Byte         Dim pdfReaderDoc As New PdfReaderpdfBytes         Dim m As New System.IO.MemoryStream         Dim b As Byte  Nothing         Try             With New PdfStamperpdfReaderDoc, m                 Dim txtField As iTextSharp.text.pdf.TextField                 txtField  New iTextSharp.text.pdf.TextField.Writer, newRect, newFldName                 txtField.TextColor  BaseColor.BLACK                 txtField.BackgroundColor  BaseColor.WHITE                 txtField.BorderColor  BaseColor.BLACK                 txtField.FieldName  newFldName ListBox1                 txtField.Alignment  0 LEFT                 txtField.BorderStyle  0 SOLID                 txtField.BorderWidth  1.0F THIN                 txtField.Visibility  TextField.VISIBLE                 txtField.Rotation  0 None                 txtField.Box  newRect 231.67, 108.0, 395.67, 197.0                 Dim opt As New PdfArray                 Dim ListBoxItemDisplay As New ListOf String                 ListBoxItemDisplay.AddOne                 ListBoxItemDisplay.AddTwo                 ListBoxItemDisplay.AddThree                 ListBoxItemDisplay.AddFour                 ListBoxItemDisplay.AddFive                 Dim ListBoxItemValue As New ListOf String                 ListBoxItemValue.Add1X                 ListBoxItemValue.Add2X                 ListBoxItemValue.Add3X                 ListBoxItemValue.Add4X                 ListBoxItemValue.Add5X                 txtField.Options  iTextSharp.text.pdf.TextField.MULTISELECT                 Dim selIndex As New ListOf Integer                 Dim selValues As New ListOf String                 selIndex.AddCInt1  SELECT 1 index                 selIndex.AddCInt3  SELECT 3 index                 txtField.Choices  ListBoxItemDisplay.ToArray                 txtField.ChoiceExports  ListBoxItemValue.ToArray                 txtField.ChoiceSelections  selIndex                 Dim listField As PdfFormField  txtField.GetListField                 If Not String.IsNullOrEmptyoldfldname amp  Then                     .AcroFields.RemoveFieldoldfldname, pg                 End If                 .AddAnnotationlistField, pg                 .Writer.CloseStream  False                 .Close                 If m.CanSeek Then                     m.Position  0                 End If                 b  m.ToArray                 m.Close                 m.Dispose                 pdfReaderDoc.Close             End With             Return b.ToArray         Catch ex As Exception             Err.Clear         Finally             b  Nothing         End Try         Return Nothing     End Function End Class codepre

Positive 1241 pI am trying to figure out GainMap tags change by ISO in .dng file. My original post is here a hrefhttpsforums.adobe.comthread1956237 relnofollowhttpsforums.adobe.comthread1956237a. I clipped links in my original post, since stackoverflow does not allow more than 2.  p  pTo understand ISOs effect better, I took 10 pictures and averaged them when ISO was 100. Then I took 10 more of the same scene and averaged them again, but this time ISO was 200. Among the two sets of images, the only change is ISO, i.e. all other parameters are fixed.p  pPixel values were doubled in RAW of the average of second set w.r.t the first set, globally, since only the ISO was doubled as I expected. I also averaged 4 GainMap opcodes separately for the first set of images ISO100, and for the second set of images ISO200. Again, when I compared the two sets ISO100 vs. ISO200, second and third opcodes are exactly the same for the two sets. However, first and fourth GainMap opcodes are different. Can you help me to figure out what is the reason of this differencep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comPCTIK.jpg relnofollowHerea Im sharing the change of GainMap opcodes, which are obtained by pointwise dividing the two matrices which are obtained by the two sets ISO100 vs. ISO200. Colorbar shows the scale of change. As I mentioned, only first and fourth GainMap opcodes are different, so that Im putting the two here. The other two are the same with each other.p  pThanks in advance for your time.p

Positive 1241 pI have a system external to Adobe Experience Manager that I need to make a quick call to whenever an Asset is deleted in AEM. Not being an expert in AEM, my options feel very limited.p  pIve attempted to create a workflow with a step that can make the appropriate call, and have hooked up a Launcher to listen for a Remove event on any damAsset type nodes from a certain path in AEM. That means Ive got a Java class Ive pushed into AEM that extends WorkflowProcess, and is called as part of that workflow. p  pHowever, this workflow is not being triggered when I go delete an Asset. If, however, I change the Launcher to listen for a Remove event on Any Node Type, the workflow is called as I would have expected, however it appears that the asset has already been deleted by the time it hits my process, so the node path provided to my process is already null and void and Im unable to do anything with it. In any case, I cant leave the Launcher set to fire on Any Node Type...p  pWhat am I missing Is there a better way to capture a delete event on an asset All I need is to be able to gather some information from the deleted node and its children to make this external call.

Negative 1241 pProblem statement Implement a plugin system that allows the associated assemblies to be overwritten avoid file locking. In .Net, specific assemblies may not be unloaded, only entire AppDomains may be unloaded.p  pIm posting this because when I was trying to solve the problem, every solution made reference to using multiple AppDomains. Multiple AppDomains are very hard to implement correctly, even when architected at the start of a project.p  pAlso, AppDomains didnt work for me because I needed to transfer Type across domains as a setting for Speech Server worfklows InvokeWorkflow activity. Unfortunately, sending a type across domains causes the assembly to be injected into the local AppDomain.p  pAlso, this is relevant to IIS. IIS has a Shadow Copy setting that allows an executing assembly to be overwritten while its loaded into memory. The problem is that at least under XP, didnt test on production 2003 servers when you programmatically load an assembly, the shadow copy doesnt work because you are loading the DLL, not IIS.p
Negative 1241 pObviously, the actual style of the oddeven rows will be done via a CSS class, but what is the best way to attach the class to the rows Is is better to put it in the markup, or is it better to do it via clientside javascript Which is better and why p  pFor simplicitys sake, lets assume that this is a large table, 100 rows, and that the color scheme is alternating oddeven rows. Additionally, some sort of javascript library that can easily do this is needed elsewhere in the page and so the overhead of that package is not a factor.p  phr p  pThe real goal of this question is to determine what tradeoffs are involved as well as how those tradeoffs should be handled, such as performance hits to the server if the page is hit under loadassume a dynamic table, bandwidth hits for users with lower connection speeds, semantic hits by adding additional layout code to the HTML The idea here is that HTML is for content, CSS is for layout, and javascript is for how the content behaves as well as controllingaugmenting the layoutp

Negative 1241 pThere are two assembliesbr  1 Assembly containing serializer. This is a place from where serialization and deserialization starts.br  2 Assembly containing serialized types. This is a place which is calling serializer from 1st assembly.br  The idea of serializer in assembly1 is simple. It has two methods which are used for conversions of objects from and to byte arrays. The client code for that serializer can look like thisp  precode    ISerializer serializer  ...      MyClass my  new MyClass     byte[] data  serializer.Serializemy     Console.WriteLineEncoding.ASCII.GetStringdata  dump serialized form     MyClass another  MyClassserializer.Deserializedata codepre  pMyClass is defined in assembly2, so assembly1 knows nothing about it. That scenario will work if serializer is implemented with standard .Net classes, like thisp  precodepublic class DotNetSerializer  ISerializer      public byte[] Serializeobject obj              BinaryFormatter formatter  new BinaryFormatter         using MemoryStream stream  new MemoryStream                      formatter.Serializestream, obj             byte[] result  stream.GetBuffer             Array.Resizeref result, intstream.Length             return result                    public object Deserializebyte[] data              BinaryFormatter formatter  new BinaryFormatter         using Stream stream  new MemoryStreamdata                      return formatter.Deserializestream                codepre  pThe serialized form of MyClass will contain information about assembly in which MyClass is defined. However, if serializer will be implemented with usage of Javas classes converted with IKVM then there will be ClassNotFound exception thrown during deserialization. This is a serializer implementation using Java classesp  precodepublic class JavaSerializer  ISerializer      public object Deserializebyte[] data              ByteArrayInputStream stream  new ByteArrayInputStreamdata         ObjectInputStream ois  new ObjectInputStreamstream         return ois.readObject           public byte[] Serializeobject obj              ByteArrayOutputStream stream  new ByteArrayOutputStream         ObjectOutputStream oos  new ObjectOutputStreamstream         oos.writeObjectobj         stream.flush         return stream.toByteArray       codepre  pThis will not work in .Net, but will work normally in Java if loaded from Eclipse with additional entries in plugin manifests such as BuddyPolicy and RegisterBuddy. I cant just switch from JavaSerializer to DotNetSerializer since in my application which is mostly written in Java there are lots of readObject,writeObject,readResolve,etc... But I need to fix that problem somehow, so I seeking for solution. Currently I see some hypothetical ways of solutionp  ul liOverloading some method of ObjectOutputStream, so serialized form of MyClass will contain assembly name too, like MyClass, MyAssembly, ....li liOverloading some method in ObjectInputStream, so class will be loaded in some different way, maybe it should be searched in some different assembly, etc.li liAdding some information to assemblies manifests so IKVM will know where to search for MyClass.

Negative 1241 pIm using a Smarty template for my web application Registration  Signup form.p  pThe form is slow to load, can I cache the registration form in order to speed up the loading of the page  p  pOn the form page, I use SESSION and do lots of PHP error checking to ensure that the form fields are completely amp correctly inputted. If not, I redisplay the form page with all inputted data and indicate to the user where they have not filled out form field data correctly. My concern, is that this error checking and using SESSION will not allow me to cache the page.p
Negative 1241 pIn integration tests, asynchronous processes methods, external services make for a very tough test code.  If instead, I factored out the async part and create a dependency and replace it with a synchronous one for the sake of testing, would that be a good thingp  pBy replacing the async process with a synchronous one, am I not testing in the spirit of integration testing  I guess Im assuming that integration testing refers to testing close to the real thing.p

Negative 1241 pIve got a Core Data managed object that has an attribute with a Boolean type.p  pIn my header file Ive got this property nonatomic, retain NSNumber  includeInHistoryp  pand Im using a dynamic includeInHistory implementationp  pWhen interacting with an instance of this managed object before saving to disk, Ive got something that actually maps to a NSCFBoolean through the NSNumber interface. Im using jsonframework to encode some dictionary containing values coming from Core Data.p  pThe problem is that after saving and retrieving the data back, includeInHistory returns what appears to be a standard NSNumber integer, not typed as Boolean. This is problematic as when converted to JSON it maps to    includeInHistory  1 instead of includeInHistory  truep  pFor now, Ive had to resort to unboxing, then reboxing everytime Im about to export as JSON, but this seems like a bug to me....

Negative 1241 pIve been using the a hrefhttpcode.google.compfjcore relnofollowFJCorea library in a Silverlight project to help with some realtime image processing, and Im trying to figure out how to get a tad more compression and performance out of the library.  Now, as I understand it, the JPEG standard allows you to specify a chroma subsampling ratio see a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiChromasubsampling relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiChromasubsamplinga and a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiJpeg relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiJpega and it iappearsi that this is supposed to be implemented in the FJCore library using the HsampFactor and VsampFactor arraysp  precode    public static readonly byte[] HsampFactor   1, 1, 1      public static readonly byte[] VsampFactor   1, 1, 1  codepre  pHowever, Im having a hard time figuring out how to use them.  It looks to me like the current values are supposed to represent 444 subsampling e.g., no subsampling at all, and that if I wanted to get 411 subsampling, the right values would be something like thisp  precode    public static readonly byte[] HsampFactor   2, 1, 1      public static readonly byte[] VsampFactor   2, 1, 1  codepre  pAt least, thats the way that other similar libraries use these values for instance, see the example code a hrefhttpmail.kde.orgpipermaildigikamdevel2007September014608.html relnofollowherea for libjpeg.  p  pHowever, neither the above values of 2, 1, 1 nor any other set of values that Ive tried besides 1, 1, 1 produce a legible image.  Nor, in looking at the code, does it seem like thats the way its written.  But for the life of me, I cant figure out what the FJCore code is actually itryingi to do.  It seems like its just using the sample factors to repeat operations that its already done  i.e., if I didnt know better, Id say that it was a bug.

Negative 1241 pIm not sure how to construct the question but Im interested to know what do you guys think of the following situations and which one would you prefer.p  pWere working at a clientserver application with winforms. And we have a control that has some fields automatically calculated upon filling another field. So were having a field currency which when filled by the user would determine an automatic filling of another field, maybe more fields. p  pWhen the user fills the currency field, a Currency object would be retrieved from a cache based on the string introduced by the user. If entered currency is not found in the cache a null reference is returned by the cache object. Further down when asking the application layer to compute the other fields based on the currency, given a null currency a null specific field would be returned. This way the default, implicit behavior is to clear all fields. Which is the expected behavior. Just to make it more clear, when the user enters a not available currency he gets notified, of course, but also the fields that depend on the currency entered should be cleared out. This is done by setting the specific control values to null.p  pWhat i would call the explicit implementation would be to verify that the Currency object is null in which case the depending fields are cleared explicitly.p  pI think that the latter version is more clear, less error prone and more testable. But it implies a form of redundancy.  The former version is not as clear and it implies a certain behavior from the application layer which is not expressed in the tests. Maybe in the lower layer tests but when the need arises to modify the lower layers, so that given a null currency something else should be returned, i dont think a test that says just that without a motivation is going to be an impediment for introducing a bug in upper layers.p  pWhat do you guys thinkp

Negative 1241 pHow would one go about detecting a page refresh  F5 key push on the controller handling the postback  I need to distinguish between the user pressing one of two buttons e.g., Next, Previous and when the F5  page refresh occurs.p  pMy scenario is a single wizard page that has different content shown between each invocation of the user pressing the Next or Previous buttons.  The error that I am running into is when the user refreshes the page  presses the F5 key, the browser resends the request back to the controller, which is handled as a postback and the FormCollection type is used to look for the submitButton key and obtain its value e.g., Next, Send.

Negative 1241 pWhat do you think is a better approach for Source Control Manager Backend. I am weighing File system vs Hosted Subversion service.

It would just keep asking...p  pI reckon, since each time the web server receives the credential, it needs to go through the password file to look up whether a match exists or not, it takes a certain amount of server resources.

Negative 1241 pI have a fairly simple application that uses a ListActivity to display a ListView.  Each ListView item has a CheckBox so that the user can specify favorite items.  I am using a class that extends SimpleCursorAdapter so that I can capture both the CheckBox changed event to save the change to the database and the list item clicked event to load an item details activity.p  pAfter the OnCheckChangedListener implementation updates the database, I call .requery on the cursor so that when an item scrolls off and then back on to the screen, the CheckBox has the proper state.p  pThat all works fine.  Where I am having problems is in another activity where I am reusing the same ListView layout and the same cursor adapter to display a specific subset of items as part of a different activitys layout.

Negative 1241 pIts actually the first time I tried to write a plugin for wordpress so my knowledge about it is really limited.p  pAs far as i know, there is such a loose rule in wordpress theme creation that whenever you create themes, you need to be widget friendly. That is as far as i understood it, youre theme must support widgets, that is your theme allows for widgets to be draggedanddropped somewhere.p  pUnfortunately, not all themes really follow the said rule as some themes sidebar uses codeltdivgtcodes while some use the more standard codeltulgtcodes.p  pSo, my question is the other way around. I want to know if there is a hook of some sort that allows me to find out the sidebars layout. And after finding that out, how do i display my widget to follow that layoutp

On the other hand, 25 can   be written as 52  02 or as 42  32.p      pYou need to solve this problem for 0    X  2,147,483,647.p      pExamplesp      p10  1 p      p25  2 p      p3  0 p      p0  1 p      p1  1p      pstrongNumbers From Competitionstrongp      p1740798996br   1257431873br   2147483643br   602519112br   858320077br   1048039120br   415485223br   874566596br   1022907856br   65br   421330820br   1041493518br   5br   1328649093br   1941554117br   4225br   2082925br   0br   1br   3  p blockquote  pMy basic strategy which Im open to critique on is to p  ol liCreate a dictionary for memoize of the input numbers initialzed to 0li liGet the largest number LN and pass it to countmemo functionli liGet the LN square root as intli liCalculate squares for all numbers 0 to LN and store in dict  li liSum squares for non repeat combinations of numbers from 0 to LNbr ul liIf sum is in memo dict, add 1 to memo  li ulli liFinally, output the counts of the original numbers.li ol  pHere is the F code See code changes at bottom Ive written that I believe corresponds to this strategy Runtime 810p  precodeopen System open System.Collections.Generic open System.IO   Get a sequence of values let rec range min max       seq  for num in [min .. max] do yield num    Get a sequence starting from 0 and going to max let rec zeroRange max  range 0 max       Find the maximum number in a list with a starting accumulator acc let rec maxNum acc  function      [] gt acc      ptail when p gt acc gt maxNum p tail      ptail gt maxNum acc tail   A helper for finding max that sets the accumulator to 0 let rec findMax nums  maxNum 0 nums   Build a collection of combinations ie [1,2,3]  1,1, 1,2, 1,3, 2,2, 2,3, 3,3 let rec combos range          seq             let count  ref 0           for inner in range do                for outer in Seq.skip count range do                    yield inner, outer               count  count  1                     let rec squares nums       let dict  new Dictionaryltint, intgt     for s in nums do         dict.[s] lt s  s     dict   Counts the number of possible double squares for a given number and keeps track of other counts that are provided in the memo dict. let rec countDoubleSquares num int memo Dictionaryltint, intgt       The highest relevent square is the square root because it squared plus 0 squared is the top most possibility     let maxSquare  System.Math.Sqrtfloatnum       Our relevant squares are 0 to the highest possible square note the cast to int which shouldnt hurt.     let relSquares  range 0 intmaxSquare       calculate the squares up front     let calcSquares  squares relSquares       Build up our square combinations ie [1,2,3]  1,1, 1,2, 1,3, 2,2, 2,3, 3,3     for sq1, sq2 in combos relSquares do         let v  calcSquares.[sq1]  calcSquares.[sq2]          Memoize our relevant results         if memo.ContainsKeyv then                         memo.[v] lt memo.[v]  1       return our count for the num passed in     memo.[num]    Read our numbers from file. let lines  File.ReadAllLinestest2.txt let nums  [ for line in Seq.skip 1 lines gt Int32.Parseline ]   Optionally, read them from straight array let nums  [1740798996 1257431873 2147483643 602519112 858320077 1048039120 415485223 874566596 1022907856 65 421330820 1041493518 5 1328649093 1941554117 4225 2082925 0 1 3]   Initialize our memoize dictionary let memo  new Dictionaryltint, intgt for num in nums do     memo.[num] lt 0   Get the largest number in our set, all other numbers will be memoized along the way let maxN  findMax nums   Do the memoize let maxCount  countDoubleSquares maxN memo   Output our results. for num in nums do     printfn i memo.[num]   Have a little pause for when we debug let line  Console.Read codepre  pAnd here is my version in C Runtime 140p  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Diagnostics using System.IO using System.Linq using System.Text  namespace FBHackDoubleSquares      public class TestInput              public int NumCases  get set          public Listltintgt Nums  get set           public TestInput                      Nums  new Listltintgt                   public int MaxNum                      return Nums.Max                    class Program              static void Mainstring[] args                       Read input from file.

Negative 1241 pI have been developing a WIF secured WCF service using the WS2007FederationHttpBinding. All of this works fine in development, but when I move to system test, where the services are hosted behind an F5, calls to the service using the F5 address fail with p  blockquote   pCould not connect to httpmyserviceservice.svc.   TCP error code 10060 A connection   attempt failed because the connected   party did not properly respond after a   period of time, or established   connection failed because connected   host has failed to respond   p blockquote  pThe system test environment is configured with 3 members in the pool. If I configure the client to connect to the service directly at the app server address, all works fine. If I reconfigure to connect to the F5 address, I get the above issue. p  pI am using a custom service host to configure the service from configuration information in a DB. On the service I am configuring the listenuri to be http[appserverhostname]myserviceservice.svc and I am configuring the endpointaddress as http[f5 dns]myserviceservice.svc. I am unable to see any activity on the service side, although I dont have access to turn on logging at the moment am working on this. p  pUnusually, on occasion the first request for a while will return the TCP error, and subsequent requests will then succeed. After some time, this sequence will occur again, suggesting it is in some way related to a timeout. Ive tried a number of modifications to the pool settings, including removing specific members from the pool, cofiguring the pool to have 1 member and running the service and client on the only member in the pool, and cant get consistent results. p  pThe service is secured using a self issued certificate, and the client is only using a DNSIdentity with the CN of the certificate as its identity. p  pWhat is wrong with the configuration in this scenario that causes calls to the WCF service to fail when it is load balanced behind an F5p  pUpdate I should have mentioned that there are 3 servers in the pool, and when I try to browse to the service address from one of the servers i.e. server 1, after I get through the internet security settings in IE the standard service page is displayed and the wsdl url indicates it is hitting one of the other servers  i.e. server 2. So the address is able to be resolved fine at the browser level. p

Negative 1241 pI am current working on a semi large MVC 2 project and the number of controllers we have with associated views and viewmodels is becoming quite large.  In order to try and provide a bit of separation I have been looking into using the areas feature of MVC 2 and refactoring the project accordingly.p  pOne of the issues I face is we have an inheritance hierachy for our controllers in order to share functionality and properties that we use in concrete controllers that then expose the necessary actions we wish to deal with.p  pEssentially we currently have a setup like so in our main controllers folderp  precodeController MVC  BaseController Abstract        BaseWorkController Abstract            BaseWorkAController Abstract                ... a number of controllers exposing actions            BaseWorkBControllers Abstract                ... a number of controllers exposing actions codepre  pI am thinking of creating Areas for each work controller i.e.p  ul liAreaWorkAli liAreaWorkBli ul  pEach area would have their associated views and viewmodels and even models.p  pHowever the problem I seem to face is where do I place the BaseWorkController.  Is it ok to leave that in the main Controllers folder and the area controllers just include a reference to that controller.  Also code in the different areas might need access to different models and even some attributes that we create for certain functionality.p  pDoes this setup seem like an acceptable use of areas.  From what I have read areas seem to help with seperating concerns and functionality which is what Im looking for.  However I dont want to invest in doing this if it is a complete wrong use of the functionalityp  pIs it acceptable that controller code use functionality from other areas or the main core controllermodelview folders. p

I realize I can use an underscore  in front of the type, but I dont really like that, as that is also used to denote class level variables or m is used too. So I end up always trying something likep  precodeDim Typ As New MyType codepre  pOk it works, but I like the C way better because it makes so much sense. Just make the 1st letter lowercase.p  pAny suggestions other than the underscore preceeding the variable name on this topicp  pThanksp

When I check the return value of the send function its exactly code9926code bytes every time the send ends. No error.p  pSmaller files send absolutely fine, and there are no issues under windows.

Negative 1241 pbrothers in code.p  pIm trying to make my WinForms app multi threaded. In DoWork of my background worker Ive got a method which changes few controls using MethodInvoker delegate.

Negative 1241 pI need to display a very long area without defined length with many polygons simple shapes  circles, squares, some text. Obviously I need only small fragment visible at a time. Main problems are efficient scrolling and handing mouse events. I write in GWT. Things i considered so farp  p1 canvas. create a canvas with the size of visible area. Create buffer canvas larger then visible area. Render to the buffer only changes  if something is changed in the visible area or new parts to the rightleft during scrolling. And when required, render proper part of the buffer to visible canvas. This seems to work fast enough. But I have to implement this smart buffering, decide which part needs to be rerendered and which not. And I need to remember all object to detect mouse clicks and mouseovers and it should be some nice structure like interval tree or segment tree, as mouseover checks are very frequent  but this is already implemented in the browser, sounds like reinventing the wheel  this is strongA LOT OF WORKstrong Maybe there is something readyp  p2 html divsimages  so, the idea is to render all elements with divs and images images can be generated on canvas first, doesnt metter. Position them absolutely on a long div and use browser scrolling to scroll the div. Works until you reach the end of this long div and you need to reposition everything so there is more space to scroll and this will freeze scrolling for some time. So maybe it would be possible to render in a second div in the meanwhile and then switch them.. It might work, but this sounds like a hack and it will probably have serious problems with multiple objects visible at a time. Plus for mouse events implemented in the browser.p  p3 SVG  I havent tried, but I think I will run into the same performance problems as with htmldivs when scrolling to rightleftp  pAny ideas Which approach is the best Is there anything better WebGL it wont work in IE and porting to IE would be hard prob. How should I implement thisp

Negative 1241 pthis is something Ive been through a few times and after a short break I am coming back with an application for a client, but just want to remember a few things before I actually implement anything.p  pI will be speaking about a multiclient server here, that deals with clients connecting through TCP onto a server bound port. p  pI remember coding this by using select , FDISSET, FDZERO, FDSET  and its family methods to accept and manage a list of connected clients on my server  and I remember it was working great, but this time it is about a simple 32 player RPG game  so nothing fastpaced, thus the TCP here.p  pSimple GOTO packets, WEATHER change, TIME updates, TEXT messages, ITEM STATE CHANGES and QUITS, LOGINS  broadcasts  , and something else I cant find out now.p  pWhat stops me from sleeping today is what should I really choose to have this server running smoothly  when speaking of its networking performance .p  pPeople tend to speak much about nonblocking approach to sockets either by using ioctlsocket.. or some other threading weirdos, which do the thing but you have to controll them in a different style  and yes I have tried this, and have seen many approaches  which deal with many threads around in the application  what is kind of overcomplicated really..p  pI have seen those MSDN ASYNCHROUNOUS sockets too, where you get the messages from the socket  but this is too much I think.p  pSo instead of coding I am thinking and would like to ask, p  ul lipif select can do the trick when speaking of a game server, handling lets say those 32 players simultanously. What I mean here is how do you think from your experience, will that do the thing Or I would have to rollback at the end and modify the whole server code while closing to the deadline..pli lipwhat exactly is the difference between doing select  ioctlsocket pli lipwhat are the pros and cons for both methods pli ul  pMany many thanks for any reply to this, I hope I am clear in what I am asking about.p
Negative 1241 pI posted a question last night, and seeing as I have made some progress but run into new issues, I am asking again, hoping for some help p  pI have a Facebook page tab on my fan page. I get the content for the iframe from a URL on my own site, as youre supposed to. On this content URL I have the comments plugin added, and finally made the moderation tool work today after much struggle. Furthermore I have a script calling the FB Javascript SDK, one calling the commments plugin and finally one that sets the height to auto and gets rid of scrollbars. p  pTwice in my script do I have to declare the URL for my comments plugin Here in the ogmetatags p  precodeltmeta propertyogurl contentURLFORMYCONTENT.COMgt codepre  pAnd here in the comments tag, as to where it links top  precodeltfbcomments hrefURLFOR MYCONTENT.COM numposts15 width500gtltfbcommentsgt codepre  pNow, the perfect scenario would be if the link that shows up in the feed of those commenting is for the facebook tab. I can do this by adding the Facebook page tab URL in the fbcomments tag, however, moderation only works when I supply the link to the actual URL with content for my iframe page tab, and alas the facebook comments module. Obviously a page that is 520px wide on a white background with no context, is not all that appropriate. But linking elsewhere than here, even for another offfacebook URL means moderation isnt working.p  pModeration is crucial here... Any good suggestionsp

Negative 1241 pI need to find the optimal path connecting two planar points. Im given a function that determines the maximal advance velocity, which depends on both the location and the time.p  pMy solution is based on Dijkstra algorithm. At first I cover the plane by a 2D lattice, considering only discrete points. Points are connected to their neighbors up to specified order, to get sufficient direction resolution. Then I find the best path by sort of Dijkstra algorithm. Next I improve the resolutionquality of the found path. I increase the lattice density and neighbor connectivity order, together with restricting the search only to the points close enough to the alreadyfound path. This may be repeated until the needed resolution is achieved.p  pThis works generally well, but nevertheless Id like to improve the overall algorithm performance. Ive implemented several tricks, such as variable lattice density and neighbor connectivity order, based on smoothness of the price function. However I believe theres a potential to improve Dijkstra algorithm itself applicable to my specific graph, which I couldnt fully realize yet.p  pFirst lets agree on the terminology. I split all the lattice points into 3 categoriesp  ul liemcoldem  points that have not been reached by the algorithm.li liemwarmem  points that are reached, but not fully processed yet i.e. have potential for improvementli liemstableem  points that are fully processed.li ul  pAt each step Dijkstra algorithm picks the cheapest emwarmem lattice point, and then tries to improve the price of its neighbors. Because of the nature of my graph, I get a kind of a cloud of emstableem points, surrounded by a thin layer of emwarmem points. At each step a emwarmem point at the cloud perimeter is processed, then its added to the emstableem cloud, and the emwarmem perimeter is potentially expanded.p  pThe problem is that emwarmem points that are consequently processed by the algorithm are usually spatially hence  topologically strongunrelatedstrong. A typical emwarmem perimeter consists of hundreds of thousands of points. At each step the next emwarmem point to process is pseudorandomal spatially, hence theres virtually no chance that two related points are processed one after another.p  pThis indeed creates a problem with CPU cache utilization. At each step the CPU deals with pseudorandom memory location.  Since theres a large amount of emwarmem points  all the relevant data may not fit the CPU cache its order of tens to hundreds of MB.p  pWell, this is indeed the implication of the Dijkstra algorithm. The whole idea is explicitly to pick the cheapest emwarmem point, regardless to other properties.p  pHowever intuitively its obvious that points on one side of a big cloud perimeter dont make any sense to the points on another side in our specific case, and theres no problem to strongswapstrong their processing order.p  pHence I though about ways of adjusting the emwarmem points processing order, yet without compromising the algorithm in general. I thought about several ideas, such as diving the plane into blocks, and partially solving them independently until some criteria is met, meaning their solution may be interfered. Or alternatively ignore the interference, and potentially allow the resolving i.e. transition from emstableem back to emwarmem.p  pHowever so far I could not find rigorous method.p  pAre there any ideas how to do this Perhaps its a know problem, with existing research and hopefully solutionsp  pThanks in advance. And sorry for the long question.p

Negative 1241 pIm sure Ive missed something somewhere since Im new to using Dojo Toolkit and am looking for some more experienced hands to enlighten me.  Im also new to stackoverflow so please bear with me as I learn the finer points of participating in this forum and getting the styling and formatting right...p  pI am attempting to load into the dojox.layout.ContentPanes inside a stackContainer the html content and the associated Dojo modules and javascript to support a DataGrid and meeting with mixed success.  Using the declarative approach seems to work well enough but attempting to use the programmatic approach using xhrGet to load ContentPanes in a stackContainer is presenting some problems.  I prefer a programmatic method over declarative since it will allow in my opinion a more modular and maintainable design.  Since I am running into problems I have to think there must be another way that works and will accomplish what Im trying to do in the way of keeping the html and javascript modular and maintainable.  I realize there is much more to establishing design constraints but this will have to do as a start.  p  pI will provide some extracts of the code below and in followup but the overall design is to setup a single web page using boundary layout container which in turn holds a titlePane and stackContainer with contentPanes.  Using links running down the left side as a navigation panel I have hooked corresponding html pages that are in turn displayed inside corresponding contentPanes and are subsequently displayed on selecting the corresponding link with a click.  This works well to a point.  Declarative DataGrid tables embedded directly in the contentPane seem to render properly with data populating correctly populating the Grid and the Dojo style formatting selected such as claro or tundra and CSS styling seeming to work as would be expected.   However if I attempt to display a DataGrid programmatically by loading entirely thru xhrGet into the contentPane as a separate html page the html page content displays but it seems that Javascript, or Dojo modules are not activated and the DataGrid is partially displayed with its headers but none of the data gets populated.  CSS formatting does seem to be working to a limited degree but more research and assessment is needed to understand how much.    p  pSo at this point the programmatic approach that Im using seems to work partially and I have not been able to get the DataGrid to populate or get a button to fire properly.  Maybe this is simply a Dojo limitation but I would have thought it to be fundamental use case that most use as their approach to organize and modularize their website implementations.  Hopefully some more experienced Dojo Toolkit users developers can enlighten me on a better way or what Ive missed.  As said before Im happy to provide additional code snippets for the sake of clarity.  Heres a recap in outline form the issuesp  pHeres what IS working for me 1. Using dijit.TitlePane I have a basic framework of menu of links running down the left side which provide the navigation between the ContentPanes inside the StackContainer.  Using href I am able to pull up a page inside the  ContentPane with no problem.  Overall this works really well. 2. The content panes can display HTML formatted pages 3. Using a declarative approach statically generated DataGrids placed directly inside the designated contentPanes of the stackContainer render and properly populate with data since they are able to be referenced by the javascript of the main calling page since that page and the html where the DataGrids reside are the same. 4. Individual html pages containing javascript and dojo modules that can be displayed standalone and render and populate DataGrid properly. p  pHeres what is NOT working 1. Javascript associated with the loaded html pages does not execute.  2. DataGrid does not populate with data if html page is loaded into content page with xhrGet.br 3. Programmatic generation of DataGrids in ContentPanes do not display at all.p  pSome things I have tried to get the remote javascript to fire and dojo DataGrid to render 1. setting up AttachEvent to dojox.layout.ContentPane with emcontainerem and execute scripts set to true in remote page. 2. use of connect 3. use of grid.resize grid.restart 4. use of stackcontainer.resize 5. xhrPost 6. dojo.parser.parse 7. specifying use of dojox.layout.ContentPane over dijit.layout.ContentPanep  pIm not saying Ive implemented these correctly only that I did make an attempt so if one of this options seems to be the way to correctly configure what Im attempting to do then any detailed steps and key points are much appreciated. p  pSome associated questions 1. What is the best approach to tracing the he location of a widget ID if  it is called separate html page that is displayed inside a contentPane 2. Is setContent a method that can be used to refresh a DataGridp  pHeres some snippets of the code to consider ...

Negative 1241 pCriteriaQuery in JPA2.0 provides a typesafe way to do select, its great. But I am wondering why it wont provide updatedelete operation To bulk updatedelete, you have to fall back to old time writing errorprone SQL or JPQL text. IMO, CriteriaQuery for updatedelete should not prove difficult as the where cause handling is the same with select.p  pHope this would be implemented in next version of JPA.p

The move gives the company time to reorganise itself without facing its creditors, and Kodak said that it would mean business as normal for customers. The company has recently moved away from cameras to refocus on making printers to stem falling profits. The 133yearold firm has struggled to keep up with competitors who were quicker to adapt to the digital era. Announcing the move to seek bankruptcy protection, Antonio M Perez, Kodaks chairman and chief executive, said The board of directors and the entire senior management team unanimously believe that this is a necessary step and the right thing to do for the future of Kodak.         ltpgt             ltdivgt             ltdiv idthird classnavcontent span20gt                 lth2gtSupport Uslth2gt                 ltpgtLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Negative 1241 pI wish to build an HTML page by separating the layout from the content generation. I plan to have say a layout.php page with a matrix structure of div elements say 33.  For div at location 1,3  firstrow,third column, I wish to call an advertisement module which will return a travel ad. For div at location2,3, the same module will be called but this time the HTML for a electronic product will be returned. p  pThe intent here is to separate layout from content generation. So I can change the layout easily. For example, for location 2,3instead of the static ad, i can call say a weather module that returns HTML showing weather data. p  pOne way I can think of is to have an advmodule.php  which has classes and member functions to return the appropriate ads HTML, with php code as below i.e. p  precodeincludeonceadvmodule.phpadv1  new ADVMODULE echo adv1gtgetAdcategorytravel   includeonceadvmodule.phpadv2  new ADVMODULE echo adv2gtgetAdcategoryelectronics codepre  pp  pBut then the HTML will have to be constructed within the member functions. This leads to a lot of ugly php code interspersed with the HEREDOC element to help construct the HTML. HEREDOC does not allow conditionals, loops ,etc p  pIs there a better way to do this I wish to avoid templating Smarty like packages if possible. p

I am using the multipage template and within in one of the pages, I make an ajax request to my server for dynamic data.p  pThe issue I am encountering is that when I cache the multi page templateindex.html, it technically is not authenticated during subsequent reloadsviews and when I make the ajax request, the server is not able to read an expected cookie value to bypass the ACL and thus allow the get request.p  pThank you in advance for replies.p

Negative 1241 pI have tried following tutorials but I keep getting lost somewhere.  p  pWhat I need is a class that creates and displays a progress bar codeJProgressBarcode that I can set the value of as I iterate over data loaded from a file and place into the database memory.  My problems come that every example I have found has some kind of counter that fills the progress bar and executes from a main function.  Every time I alter that tutorial to be a class that I can call at will and display the bar, I do not get the bar showing IE the frame comes up but the bar does not even look like it is added to the frame until after the iteration is done.  p  pI have tried using codeSwingUtilities.invokeLatercode and codeSwingWorkercode latest attempt at class below all having the same issue.  To make matters worse, I can do a codedbug.myMessagecode basically sends to codeSystem.outcode and see a message that shows that the bar is changing in memory just not showing.

Negative 1241 pI was wondering about the best way to setup to following.p  pI have a dynamic form that can potentially get very long once a user has finished adding their data. What I was hoping to setup is a background process that saves the data they have to the database.p  pWhat I had setup was a settimer function that would check if a question is in a saved state and if not add it to a list of questions to save. Then it would trigger an ajax call which uses php to post to my database. The first time this happens the ajax will return the id of the submission so the form knows where to post these to.p  pThe second time the set timer function is run it passes this id.p  pMy biggest problem is I dont want the user to know table ids. I was just thinking someone can mess with the javascript and submit their results to other ids pretty easily.p  pI was just wondering if there is a better way to achieve this Or even some examplesp  pThanksp

Negative 1241 pOk, so heres the situation. I currently have a view controller called codeMainViewControllercode which has a UITableView with many different cells. When I click on a cell, I want that cell to expand grow in height and show some additional information. The problem is, this additional information is very complex and can contain UILabels, other UITableViews, UIWebViews and UIImageViews. Furthermore, this additional data requires quite a bit of computation in order to determine what exactly to display i.e. what the UILabels say, how large the UIImageViews are. Therefore, because of the complexity of this additional information, Im at a loss as to how to design my program. p  pThe additional information requires a lot of code, thus I dont want to just throw that code into the codeMainViewController.code Additionally, it would be nice if there was some way to use Interface Builder to design these additional information views graphically rather than programatically. p  pCurrently I have each set of additional information as its own separate UIViewController thus allowing me to have separate classes for the data and allowing me to use interface builder and I just segue to a new screen when a cell is selected. However, I dont want to segue to a new screen I want all of the data that this UIView controller is showing to be shown in codeMainViewControllercode. Whats the best way to do thisp  pIn summary, I currently have one UIViewController segueing to another UIViewController however, I want the second UIViewControllers content to be show in the first. If possible I would like to use some sort of Interface Builder and to separate out the logic for this second UIViewController into another class. p  pDetails  Im developing for iOS 5 only and Im using ARC.  Ive never developed for iOS 4 or below before and I have never used nib files before but I would be willing to learn if required. Simple sample code would be helpful.  Thanksp

Negative 1241 pIve implemented a singleton to display adWhirl ads. However, when I change scenes in my storyboard app, the viewController for the ad is not updated until a new ad is requested. I have viewControllerForPresentingModalView implemented in the singleton and I set it with displayVC on every viewdDidLoad. But since the VC is not changed until a new ad is requested, any previous ads specifically admob cannot display fullscreen because their VC is set to the previous scene.

Negative 1241 pI have internationalized my play app using messages.en, messages.de etc. However, the US and UK have different date format preferences.p  pThe play documentation is a bit unclear and I thought you had to use 2letter ISO codes but it seems that the 3letter ISO language codes work in play as well. p  pI found eng and enu here and plugged it into play and success. a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryee82548828vcs.2029.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryee82548828vcs.2029.aspxap  pI cant find them documented in official ISO though and would prefer that play be a bit more clear that 3letter codes work so I know its a feature and not a bug.p  pIn general, any recommendations on how to best do the date formats here Is tying them to the language selection a good idea or better to give users a choice independent of languagep

Negative 1241 pI have an Outlook macro that saves and prints hundreds of PDF files every day using IE8. We are upgrading to IE9, my testing thus far shows that the script will not function because IE9 does not allow disabling the file download prompt. I cant use sendkeys, the screen is locked on the workstations that run the script. The script must use IE to download because it accesses a CGI script at the remote end in order to validate and fetch the document. Its not a direct download. So I cant seem to escape the IE9 security. p  pIs there a way to get the document to open in IE, outside of Acrobat, and save the document that way I would like a solution outside of AutoIT or any other 3rd party utility that I probably will not be able to purchaseinstall.p

Negative 1241 pI have my liquibase schema defined initially for PostreSQL. Now, I have to modify the schema file to support Oracle. I have a changeset that has a codeltsqlgtcode tag. It has a query that accesses the codepgcatalogcode table to set a value to the sequence. However, this will not work for Oracle. If I remove it, the Liquibase complains with checksum validation fail.

Negative 1241 pI am having a problem that seems simple on the surface but I cant find an answer anywhere.  I am trying to set the MaintainScrollPositionOnPostback property of the pages in my web app to true.  I have it set to true in my web.config, I am setting it programmatically in the codebehind of my page, I have it set to true in my pages directive, yet anytime I step through and debug, it is showing as false.  In fact, if I set a breakpoint on the line of code emimmediately afterem I set it to true, it is still showing as false.  Naturally, all of my pages jump to the top after every postback which is annoying.  This is happening even on a page with no master page and no base page, so I dont have any extra code stepping on my changes.  If I create a brand new web application from scratch this property works as expected.  Does anyone have any clues as to what might cause this property to behave this way  It is as if there is some global configuration that is implicitly forcing this property to be disabled, but I cannot find any documentation explaining such an effect.p

Its very concise, easy to work with, I love it. However, I noticed that the routes defined in the sample allow for the codeNamecode parameter to not be included. Of course, codeHello, code looks kind of lame as output. I could use codeString.IsNullOrEmptycode, but it is idiomatic in F to be explicit about things that are optional by using the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd233245.aspx relnofollowOptiona type. So I modified my codeHellocode type accordingly to see what would happenp  precode[ltCLIMutable Routehello RoutehelloNamegt] type Hello   Name  string option  codepre  pAs soon as I did this, the F type system forced me to deal with the fact that codeNamecode might not have a value, so I changed codeHelloServicecode to this to get everything to compilep  precodetype HelloService      inherit Service      member x.AnyreqHello          box  Result                   match req.Name with                  Some name gt sprintf Hello, s name                  None gt Hello  codepre  pThis compiles, and runs perfectly when I dont supply a codeNamecode parameter.

So the only satisfying, nonhacky way of having one class as an optional property of another class is with, you guessed it, the Option type.p  hr  pemstrongUpdateemstrongp  pI was able to sortof get this working by making the following changesp  pIn the ServiceStack source, I made this type public codeServiceStack.Text.Common.ParseFactoryDelegatecodep  p...and I also made this field public codeServiceStack.Text.Jsv.JsvReader.ParseFnCachecodep  pWith those two things public, I was able to write this code in F to modify the codeParseFnCachecode dictionary. I had to run this code prior to creating an instance of my AppHost  it didnt work if I ran it inside the AppHosts codeConfigurecode method.p  precodeJsvReader.ParseFnCache.[typeofltOptionltstringgtgt] lt      ParseFactoryDelegatefun  gt          ParseStringDelegatefun s gt if String.IsNullOrEmpty s then None else Some s gt box codepre  pThis works for my original test case, but aside from the fact that I had to make brittle changes to the internals of ServiceStack, it sucks because I have to do it once for each type I want to be able to wrap in an codeOptionltTgtcode.p  pWhat would be better is if I could do this in a generic way. In C terms, it would be awesome if I could provide to ServiceStack a codeFuncltT, OptionltTgtgtcode and ServiceStack would, when deserializing a property whose generic type definition matches that of the return type of my function, deserialize codeTcode and then pass the result into my function.p  pSomething like that would be amazingly convenient, but I could live with the onceperwrappedtype approach if it were actually part of ServiceStack and not my ugly hack that probably breaks something somewhere else.p
Negative 1241 pI am trying to baby step my way into the new State Restoration feature of iOS6.  I have an existing TabBar based app using Storyboard.  I set the restoration ID of the root tab bar and each top level view controller loaded by the story board, including embedded navigation controllers.p  pI Opt in via the app delegate options.  Then when I select another tab bar view, send to background and stop via Xcode and relaunch I get the following behavior.  p  pIt Launches to the previously selected screen as expected but moments later it switches to the main Home screen.  p  pIt was my understanding that just setting the root controller if its a tab bar controller, Id get the selected index restored without any code. p  pIf I create a brand new project with the tab bar controller template, this works with no issue, i.e. it restores the the selected controller and stays on this selection.p  pIve tried commenting out my entire common launch options, the entire view did load  did appear on the home view controller thinking it was somehow having an impact but the result was the same.  p  pWhat would be a good way to debug this further  Note Ive not implemented any view controller specific state changes.  In this case, Im merely trying to remember the last selected view as a starting point.  Ive tried different views as the stepping out point and the result is the same, whatever was the last view displays briefly at launch then swaps to the home screen.p  pBy the way, noticed the WWDC 2012 Video was demonstrating force quitting to test state restoration which does NOT work now.  Per docs this will clear state and that has been my experience.  I am stopping via Xcode as is recommended in the docs.p

As an exercise Im trying to write my own JSON parser in the PARSE dialect.p  pSince Douglas Crockford a hrefhttpnews.ycombinator.comitemid780554 relnofollowcredits influence of Rebol on his discovery of JSONa, I thought it would be easy.  Outside of replacing braces with brackets and getting rid of all those commas, one of the barriers to merely using codeLOADcode on the string is the fact that when they want to do the equivalent of a codeSETWORDcode they use something that looks like a string to Rebols tokenizer, with an illegal stray colon after itp  precode     key one           summary This is the string content for key ones summary,          value 7     ,     key two           summary Another actually string, not supposed to be a symbol,          value 100       codepre  pBasically I wanted to find all the cases that were like codefoo barcode and turn them into codefoobarcode while leaving matching quote pairs that were not followed by colons alone.p  pWhen I tackled this in PARSE which I understand rather well in principle but still havent used much a couple of questions came up.  But mainly, what are the promised conditions under which when you can escape into code and modify the series out from under the parser...specifically in Rebol 3  More generally, is it the emright kind of tool for the jobemp  pHere was the rule I tried, that appears to work for this part of the taskp  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecodeany [      require a matched pair of quotes amp capture series positions before      and after the first quote, and before the last quote      to  beforePos skip startPos to  endPos skip       optional colon next if not there the rest of the next rule is skipped      opt [                    if we got to this part of the optional match rule, there was a colon.          we escape to code changing spaces to dashes in the range we captured                       setWordString copypart startPos endPos             replaceall setWordString space              change startPos setWordString                    break back out into the parse dialect, and instead of changing the           series length out from under the parser we jump it back to the position          before that first quote that we saw          beforePos           Now do the removals through a match rule.  We know they are there and          this will not cause this coloncase match rule to fail...because we          saw those two quotes on the first time through          remove [] to  remove []     ] ] codepre  pIs that okay  Is there any chance of the codechange startPos setWordStringcode in the open code mucking up the outer parse...if not in this case, then in something subtly differentp  pAs always, any didactic emits cleanershorterbetter this other wayem advice is appreciated.p  pstrongP.S.strong why isnt there a codereplaceallpartcodep

Negative 1241 pstrongWhat is a good general design, taking advantage of TypeScript language features, for an RPCstyle communication channel between Windows and Workersstrongp  pstrongSharedWorkersstrong are javascript code listings that are run by the browser outside the context of a specific browser window.  A single SharedWorker by script URI is shared by all open browser windows whose own code request it.  Windows and workers communicate through the entangled codeworker.portcode objects to which a sender can postMessage and from which a receiver can listen for message events.  The most consistently supported type allowed to be posted is a single codestringcode which can easily be a codeJSON.stringifyofSomeObjectcode but may be of any custom format.p  pstrongTypeScriptstrong is an extension of javascript which provides some useful type safety and other helpful application code management features.p  pstrongRemote Procedure Callstrong libraries such as WCF uses SOAstyle Contract interfaces shared by both all sides of a communication channel and abstracts the monotonous and errorprone necessity of serializing and deserializing requests.p  hr  pCommunicating between browser Windows and their Worker is similar to RPC since we cannot pass code as data through the channel.  One main difference is that communications are oneway only.  A sender can post a message but cannot block and wait for a result.  Instead, the application layer is responsible for matching received data to sent requests if appropriate.p  pTo take advantage of the typing features of TypeScript, it seems to me that following the Contract paradigm is a good choice.  We needp  ol lione interface for each receivers service Contract.li lia receiver implementation of each Contractli lia proxy implementation of each Contractli ol  pFirst we need to teach TypeScript about SharedWorkers buidling on lib.d.ts definitions.  SharedWorker.d.tsp  precodeinterface ConnectEvent extends Event      ports MessagePort[]   interface SharedWorker extends EventTarget, AbstractWorker      port MessagePort   declare var SharedWorker      prototype SharedWorker     new scriptURL any, name any SharedWorker     new scriptURL any SharedWorker  codepre  pIn WCF, we have an ambient OperationContext to know about the connected client.  We also return a value in most cases to send a response to a request.  p  pIn javascript, we dont have ThreadStatic and I doubt we can reliably provide an ambient equivalent of OperationContext.  Each code listing is run singlethreaded, but the way asynchrony is implemented with the timer callbacks and possibly employed by the Worker implementation I dont think we could keep track of it right.p  pWith MessagePorts, we cant return a value.  Instead we have to send another oneway response back to the requester and so we need a handle to the return MessagePort.  However, this return MessagePort cannot be part of the Contact since the Proxy implementation would not have a need for it.  All I can think of to do is create a new instance of the Implementation class initialized with receiverproxyspecific differences such as the return MessagePort and any other data, such as the array of all connected MessagePorts for broadcast messages.  Then the member methods of the implementation can reference those as they might an OperationContext.p  pAnd an example of the message event handlerp  precodeworker.port.addEventListenermessage, e MessageEvent gt      var data  JSON.parsee.data     new ReceiverImplementationworker.port[data.name].applythis, data.params , false codepre  pA proxy implementation might have a function such asp  precodeSessionLoginusername string      this.worker.port.postMessageCommandSessionLogin, arguments  codepre  pThe message event handler applies the received parameters to the specified method name.  The ReceiverImplementation object ought to be independent as shown, perhaps, from any other class since we would want to avoid method name collisions.  Perhaps not though  were talking among client code run on a client machine.  There arent the same security concerns nor ability to enforce guards.p  pPosting the whole prototype is too longcomplicated and because of the subject matter, it wont fit into a jsfiddle.  And anyway, what I have isnt that great.  It still seems like a bunch of boilerplate code for very little functionality.p  pAnd Im pretty sure all of this would apply to nonShared Web Workers as well, but with all this trouble of communicating, I dont see the value proposition for the nonshared varietyp  pemThis is a sprawling questionem, but I hope Ive done an OK job of explaining it.  What are your ideas for solving this WindowWorker communication  How can the relaxed nature of javascript and the mere illusion of safety of TypeScript be exploited for a simpler and less errorprone communication  I suspect Im taking the .NETlimitationsinspired WCF and porting them too closely to javascript.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1241 pI am recently in the process of moving from oracle to mysql and would like some advice if how i am implementing something similar to sequences in mysql is a good way.p  pEssentially how i am currently going to implement it is by having a separate table in mysql for each sequence in oracle and have a single column which represents the lastnumber and increment this column when ever i insert a new row, thats one way another way i could go about doing it is by creating a single table with several rows representing each sequence and increment each row separately whenever i do an insert.p  pAnother simpler way of doing it i could just do a select max1 on the relevant column when inserting data.p  pIm basically thinking of switching to the select max1 option as it seems simpler to implement, but i would like to get some advice on what you think would be the best way of doing it out of these options, and if there is any pitfalls that i am currently not aware of when using select max1.p  pAlso the reason im am not using autoincrement and the function lastinsertid is i want  to follow the ansi standard. p  pThanks.p

Negative 1241 pIm using the Spock testing framework together with the SpockSpring extension which allows you to use Springs Transactional and Rollback annotations. Given that I got a data driven test like thisp  precodeTransactional Rollback def Some Testint foo    when   someDao.insertfoo    then   notThrownException    where   foo ltlt [0..100]  codepre  pNow what happens when I run this, is that this test is executed 101 times with a different value of foo. What also happens is, that the transaction is rolled back after each test. What I would like to have is that the transaction is only rolled back after the 101 tests have been run and not after each test. I could of course write a loop inside the test but it would be nicer if I could control when the transaction is rolled back  after each test or after all tests. Is there any way to control this or am I stuck with the loopp

I have many images, each customer have about hundreds images, size of each image about 1mb or 2mb. I think have no server can handle it. Another way is create thumbnail on client by jQuery, but I cant do it and my friend talk with me. jQuery dont handle it. How can I do it for my solution Hope you understand what I meanp

Negative 1241 pI have a highly annoying issue wherein log4j refuses to find the properties file in my new project.  I am using Hibernate4, which uses jbosslogging for some ungodly reason.  I have a log4j.properties in my WEBINFclasses by making a resources source folder.  I can see the log4j.properties in the classes folder so i know RAD is picking up the file as source.  It looks like as followsp  precodelog4j.rootLoggerWARN, stdout log4j.gov.usdojINFO  Direct log messages to the console log4j.appender.stdout  org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender log4j.appender.stdout.layout  org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout log4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern  dyyyyMMdd HHmmss c2[ML] p mn   Hibernate logging optionsINFO only shows startup messages org.hibernate Log everything.

I get  a no appenders error on startup pointing to org.hibernate.type.BasicTypeRegistry.  I have hibernatejpa in a bootstrap area because RAD has a different version of the same jar it runs and we vet the Orphan ManyToOne error if we dont put hibernatejpa in the bootstrap area.  If someone knows a better solution to that, Id like to hear it because I hate doing that.  p  pBut the topic at hand is that for some reason on this project I cant get log4j to find that log4j.properties file.  I kind of suspect i am the victim of the classloader issue with the hibernate thing, but log4j.jar is in my WEBINFlib.p

Negative 1241 pThis is for a college project. The professor told we need to use neo4j for graph database and since POJOs cannot be stored as nodes in neo4j, we will need to use spring data too. Sounded good enough. When I actually got down coding, the tutorials I came across were way over my head. The sample code made use of annotations, xml, beans and whatnot without any explanation as to where they come from. I assume they are all a part of spring framework which I have no experience with. So how much spring will I need to learn before thinking of spring neo4j I cannot ask help from my professor since he is the management type of guy who knows all the words like technologies but has no  idea how they work.p

Negative 1241 pIve coded myself into a corner and would like your help to dig me out again. In the right direction.p  pSo, Ive implemented a minor SQLite wrapper where I wanted the solution to be generic dont we all. Afterwards, I now realize that the usage of these classes and interfaces arent very intuitive nor generic.p  pLets start at the bottom and work upwards. Ive created a class called codeDataRowcode that works as a base class for my table rows. The class codeDataRowcode itself only has a property codeIdcode since all rows need one. This results in the following definition codeclass DataRow  public int Id  get set  codep  pUsing this codeDataRowcode class, is each table. And for database tables Ive created one generic interface, and one generic base class. The definitions looks like thisp  precodeinternal interface ITableltTgt     where T  DataRow, new      T Selectint id     ListltTgt SelectListltintgt ids     int InsertT t     void UpdateT t     bool Deleteint id   public class TableltTgt  ITableltTgt     where T  DataRow, new       Commented out to protect you from a minor case of serious brain damage.  codepre  pThis setup allows me to create concise definitions. In fact, they tend to be quite epic, really. Proud to say.p  precodepublic class Car  DataRow      public decimal ParkingTicketDebt  get set      public DateTime WhenWifeWillAllowReplacement  get set      public bool CanTransformIntoSomethingAwesome  get set    public class Cars  TableltCargt       Yep, thats all. You can go home now, folks. Theres nothing here. Nothing at all. Especially not a great treasure of gold. Whops... I mean... theres really not. Not that Im aware of, anyway... I mean, there could be. Not that I wouldnt say if I had any information on this great trasure of gold that might exist. But I know nothing of such an item. I really dont, so you can stop thinking about this great treasure of gold. Since I dont know anything about it, the chance that it even exist is extremely low. Miniscule. I mean, you would probably not find anything, not even if you digged for, like, a really long time. Seven years or something. Oookay. Slowly fading away...  codepre  pAs you may or may not have noticed, Im using the class type name of codeCarscode to determine the name of the table in the database. Likewise, Im performing reflection on codeCarcode and use its public property names and types to getset values in the database. And yes, Im aware that Im in the process of coding a stripped down version of Entity Framework. Which sounds both really stupid and quite time consuming.p  pAnyway, here is a usage example of the class codeCarscode, which I must remind you that Im proud ofp  precodenew Cars.Delete3497  Note that I have a great number of expensive cars. codepre  pNice, eh One slight problem. This means that I have to write strongly typed code, specific to the number of tables that exist in the database. And I dont like specific code. I like generic code.p  pYou might start arguing here that Im overdoing it. Then let me tell you this. Youre damn right Im overkilling Im intentionally flamethrowing the dead guy that was ran over by a tank. Seven times.p  pSo I started experimenting a bit and came up with this delicate solutionp  precode[ScriptMethodResponseFormat  ResponseFormat.Json] [WebMethodEnableSession  true] public int CreateEmptyRowstring tableName      var tableType  Type.GetTypetableName     if tableType  null         throw new TypeLoadExceptionDumbass. That table doesnt exist      var instance  Activator.CreateInstancetableType as ITableltdynamicgt     if instance  null         throw new TypeLoadExceptionIdiot. That type isnt a table      return instance.Insertnew DataRow  codepre  pNote that I can really understand if you have no idea why someone would want to create an empty row.p  pSo whats wrong with this Well, it doesnt compile, for one. Heres the error codeThere is no implicit reference conversion from dynamic to DataRowcode. A search on Google gave a hrefhttpwww.google.comsearchq22There20is20no20implicit20reference20conversion20from20dynamic22 relnofollowfew resultsa.p  pThe problem is obviously codeActivator.CreateInstancetableType as ITableltdynamicgtcode. Ive tried things like codeActivator.CreateInstancetableType as ITableltTableltDataRowgtgtcode, an attempt which gave me this error codeThe type DataRow must be convertible to DataRowcode.p

Negative 1241 pIm using csv.DictReader to read in a file. It actually returns a list of dictionaries, rather than a single dictionary. How can I force it to return a single dictionary or how can I merge the list of dictionaries it returnsp  precodedef agilente8361cpnareadfileloc          Load the .s2p file in to a dictionary.           with openfileloc as f          define the fields in the Agilent .s2p file         colnames  [f,s11,args11,s21,args21,s12,args12,s22,args22]           read the data into a dictionary         s2pdicts  csv.DictReaderitertools.ifilterninput.iscomment, f, fieldnamescolnames, delimiter       return s2pdict codepre  pIdeally, the data would be initially read into a single dictionary and never need to be merged. It is a set of data. The columns belong together and are nonsense without the full set or a coherent subset. If DictReader isnt pythonically capable of this feat, Ill settle on just merging the list of dictionaries. This shouldnt be an uncommon thing that scientists and programmers alike want to do with a dataset.p

Negative 1241 pI am attempting to develop a Person database Java Swing application, using MVC design paradigm with ObserverObservable. Here is a simplified abstract of MVCs I am usingp  precodeApp     AppModel         Empty right now, possibly ill store certain static application info such as version number here     AppView         Creates a JFrame and a few other Swing components     AppController         Instantiates AppModel, AppView and also a PersonController and a PersonListController  Person      PersonModel         Stores info for 1 person      PersonView         Displays a number of form fields inside a JPanel i.e Name, Age, Phone number. Observes PersonModel.      PersonController         Instantiates PersonView. Observes PersonView. Instantiates PersonModel. Updates PersonModel.  PersonList      PersonListModel         Stores a list of Persons      PersonListView         Displays a list of persons with appropriate Add  Delete buttons. Observes PersonList.      PersonListController         Instantiates PersonListView. Observes PersonListView. Instantiates PersonListModel. Updates PersonListModel codepre  pAlso, a bootstrap, where the app starts. It creates a new AppController.p  pIn the real application, there will be more and different ModelViewController objects but I want to keep this example simple.p  pI dont understand how I can go about merging these seperate views into one UI while maintaining a good seperation of concerns.p  pTake for example the PersonListView. IMHO it doesnt need to care about the AppView with the JFrame etc. PersonListView just needs to look at its emownem model and update emitselfem accordingly. However, I cannot enforce that because the PersonListViews own Swing components need to be added to the Swing components of another view, the AppView.p  pSo at the moment the AppController is instantiating its own View, plus indirectly a PersonView and PersonListView via instantiation of their controllers. AppController then grabs the main Jpanel for each view, grabs the parent Swing components they should be added to on the AppView, and adds them.p  pThis just doesnt seem the right way to do it to me. Im pulling Swingrelated members from their hiding places and messing with them around inside a controller. In fact instantiating the model and view within the controller seems bad too, but I cant figure out a better way.p  pIve seen enough simple MVC tutorials recently that Im dreaming of the bloody things  but not one tutorial seems to go into the relationships of multiple models, views, controllers, especially where it concerns Swing. Maybe I am wrong and the App should have just one view Maybe I need a Relationship class that sort of takes every single ModelViewController and instantiates stuff appropriatelyp  pAny advice would be most appreciated as Im completely at a lossp

Negative 1241 pI need to find an approach to the problem of generating texture maps for nonconvex polyhedrons without using a design tool. Specifically, I am mapping simulation results data onto a 3D surface.

I use a standard connection on MySQL mysqlconnect...in I put it as an included file... because its a distributed database, in which in one website therell be more than one connection attemp to make, if one of the connection failed...p  plike this, I made two conn file..its just examples though...p  precodeltphp server192.168.0.3 useruser passpass dbdb1  conn  mysqlconnectserver,user,pass ifconn die connection error seldb  mysqlselectdbdb,conn ifseldb die wrong db gt codepre  pso I made the second one with db2 as the database... and I put the on the website using if..p  precodeltphp requireonce conn1.php if emptyconn     requireonce conn2.php  gt codepre  pand I intentionally closecut the connection on the first server...so if the first connect attemp failed, it will goes to the second one.. but it ended up showing error trying to connect to a unexisted host, well I forgot about the detail but something like that...and didnt show anything else..p  pso I tried to close the second server... I thought the result will be different, it has to be showing a normal result since the first connection didnt fail...but the result is, the website still showed a same warning error..p  pso I just thought that instead of using those connection files, I have to put an IP tracking code to check the other server is online or not, and then called the connection file...p  por is it another way to do it...p  pSorry if you dont understand my question, please tell me if my question is a bit confusing.. and thanks..p

Negative 1241 pIm wondering if theres any clean way to implement an optional variable throughout a class hierarchy without simply leaving it null and nullchecking all the time. Lets say I have the following abstract parent classp  precodepublic abstract class Item   public String name  public ItemString name     this.name  name   public String getName     return name  codepre  pPretty straightforward. Now I have another abstract class that extends this and a couple more that extend that one, each with a few additional variablesmethods of their own. Item also has a stub class extending it nothing but a constructor that calls super that may not be necessary if Item can be made concrete, but that depends on the solution.p  pNow, lets say that any of these concrete classes could potentially contain an instance of MyObject. A large number of Items will be created. Some of the instances of any of the classes in the Item hierarchy will have it and some wont. Theres no way for the program to tell at compile time. I cant really split the hierarchy into two separate but nearlyidentical trees, one with MyObject and one without. Thats going to lead to a lot of code duplication. Subclassing the concrete implementations with another concrete class containing MyObject would mean excessive typechecking, which would get ugly, especially if the hierarchy grows. Putting an interfaceabstract class further up isnt an option either as that would put MyObject in everything. Regardless of the solution, all of these must have a common interfaceabstract class.p  pI may be nitpicking and should just implement MyObject at the top of the hierarchy and nullcheck it or use a simple boolean method to tell me if its present or not, but it still feels a bit sloppy to me and Id like to find a better solution if possible.p
Negative 1241 pI am using Azure Virtual Machine Windows Server 2008 R2 image provided from the gallery and created Public port and private port using the portal.

Negative 1241 pI have recently started web development.  As I have been trying to make pages with jQuery on them, I have been having a bunch of trouble.  The code I write and link to from my HTML page wont load, and when I look at the console in a browser, it doesnt show any scripts being loaded.  The only way I can get them to load is by wrapping my code in codeltscriptgtcode tags in the HTML document itself, and then it works fine.  I have tried using codeltscript srcsource.jsgtcode in the codeltheadgtcode tags, as well as before the closing codeltbodygtcode tag but nothing happens.  The .css file loads and aside from the Javascript, the website works fine.

Negative 1241 pFirst here is my Plunker code a hrefhttpplnkr.coeditlh9t3ThQrJF3Tauv5Snoppreview relnofollowhttpplnkr.coeditlh9t3ThQrJF3Tauv5Snoppreviewap  pPlease note that you should expand the preview pane to the left in order to see all of the elements.p  pWhat Im trying to do is reduce the spacing between the red codeXcode remove symbol and the codeitemcode. Basically when you press the red codeXcode the codeitemcode is removed from the codenavbarcode. Right now it doesnt look right at all with the huge spacing between the two. Ive tried using other elements such as codespancode, codeltagtcode, codepaddingcode, codemargincode, and they all doesnt seem to be too compatible with the codenavbarcode as it seems to only like codeltligtcode in terms of alignment and spacing.p  pWhat else can I do to get the spacing to come closer between the red codeXcode and codeitemcodep

Negative 1241 pThis turned into a rather long post, and theres not really an answer per say. Im more looking for an explanation as opposed to some silver bullet to fix the problem. As such, any aspect youd like to answer would be quite appreciated. Thanks in advance p  hr  pIm running into what may be a problem with the file system object, and thats lead to a question about the functionality etc. of how the File System Object in VBA works vs. something else I dont know if theres an alternative to use in Excel for what Im doing in .net etc. I dont know of a better place to ask, and Im not sure what to look into to research it for myself. So here I am p  pSo To the problem. The short explanation is that I iterate through folders, gathering file information name, extension, full path, etc. and place it into a spreadsheet. I eventually use this information to copy the files to a new location. However, on a large scale 1,000 files this seems to work just fine locally, but it is considerably slower on a network location at work. It will chew through like 1,500 files, wait a while, do 1,500 more etc. Either while listing or copying the files. Again, this is not the case when done locally, it will just run through without issue, so I can probably assume its probably nothing to do with my code. Its almost as if the network is opening and closing a gate intermittently. p  pAlternatively, using other programs from an end user perspective I tried it against the same files I was using with my program, on our work network it is MUCH faster without any of the aforementioned delays. Im assuming the alternative program is using some version of .net, if it matters. Long story short, I dont think I can inherently blame our network for the speed issues Im running into. p  pSo my questioncuriosityissue comes down to a few key points p  pWhats the difference between the FSO in VBA and the default libraries in .Net, and could the difference between the cause of the issue Im running into Clearly its possible to read this sort of data much more quickly than it is being done. p  pIs the FSO not intended to be used this way over a network, with large amounts of remote data, or...  Is it just datedoutmoded And is there an alternative that can be used through VBA p  pI only nebulously understand that our network functions in a different way than a local drive. It stores many terabytes of data, etc. and Im not sure what the difference is at a very deep level between accessing a local drive and a network location. I know Im not giving details on the network that would probably be very beneficial in diagnosis, I just dont the information unfortunately. I guess Id just ask if it potentially an explanation that using the FSO in such a way with someall sorts of networks is just not the way its meant to be used. Is it possible that the network is set up in such a way to limit the sort of way Im trying to interact with it p  pEven though I havent run into any issues doing this locally, is it possible that something in my code is much more taxing to a network location vs. a local drive p  pThanks for any insight you can provide. p

Negative 1241 pI was working on kinda exploration of File Allocation Table recovery last couple of weeks. My purpose is to locate a possibly deleted file by its signature for example, ZIP file by 50 4B 03 04 bytes and recover the whole thing to search inside of it. p  pIve explored theres a problem with FAT file system uses allocation table indicies for both cluster chain storing and deleted files marking, making files recovery, at first sight, impossible.p  pBut theres hell of a recovery software advertising promising recovery of files deleted from FAT file system. So, there might be a workaround, I assume. p  pIve found that we can successfully recover files continuously located on disk. First cluster gives us an index, and index address value gives us strong possiblity of finding a directory entry where file size is stored. But is it the end Id like to recover fragmented files as well, but cant find the way.p  pMay anyone know a workaround and help me here a bit, please p

Then in JavaScript, I get its width and check in while loop.

Negative 1241 pExcept the question whether the following scenario is a good case for DDD at all, Id like to discuss it and ask for advicep  blockquote   pGiven we have users and groups. A user has a name, and a group has a name as well. Users may join of leave groups, and they may also change groups. The rules they have to obey are A user may only be in maximally 2 groups, and a group may consist of maximally 10 users.p blockquote  pHow do you model this So far I can think of three options, where each option has its individual advantages and disadvantagesp  ol lipUsers and groups are entities, and both are aggregates as well. codeJoincode, codeSwitchcode and codeLeavecode are commands on the group aggregate. While this works great for codeJoincode and codeLeavecode as they only refer to a single group, it does not work for codeSwitchcode, as this refers to two groups at the same time, and hence needs to modify two aggregates in a single transaction, which is not nice.pli lipUsers and groups are entities, and both are aggregates as well. codeJoincode, codeSwitchcode and codeLeavecode are commands on the user aggregate. This works great for all three, and it is easy to check that a user is not in more than two groups at the same time, but how would you check that the rule of maximally 10 users per groups is not violatedpli lipUsers and groups are entities, both are aggregates. But there is also a third aggregate Relationship. codeJoincode, codeSwitchcode and codeLeavecode are now commands on the relationship aggregate. While this seems to be the best approach since it gives the relation between users and groups a name and makes it explicit, I am now completely lost on how to model the constraints.pli ol  pCan anybody give me a hintp  pIf there was only one of the two constraints it would be deadeasy Then you could put the commands to the aggregate which also has the constraints.

Negative 1241 pIve just ported my application from Qt 4.8.4 to Qt 5.2.1. I have an issue with the codeFlowLayoutcode class as provided in the a hrefhttpqtproject.orgdocqt5.0qtwidgetslayoutsflowlayout.htmlFlowLayout example code in the Qt docsa.p  pI have a codeQMainWindowcode with a codeQDockWidgetcode docked at the bottom of the central widget. The codeQDockWidgetcode has a codeFlowLayoutcode with several child widgets. In Qt 4.8, this worked like a charm, the size of the child widgets fitted the standard size of the codeDockWidgetcode. However, in Qt 5.2, the codeDockWidgetcode tries to increase its size to the maximum taking the place from the central widget. Changing its layout prevents this unwanted behavior. But of course, I use codeFlowLayoutcode on purpose.p  pTo illustrate the problem, I created a minimal example p  pThe constructor of the codeDockWidgetcodep  precode    QGroupBox generalBox  new QGroupBox     generalBoxLayout  new FlowLayout     generalBoxgtsetLayoutgeneralBoxLayout      forint i0 ilt10 i              QPushButton button  new QPushButtonTest, this         buttongtsetMinimumWidth100         buttongtsetMinimumHeight100         generalBoxLayoutgtaddWidgetbutton           thisgtsetWidgetgeneralBox codepre  pDoes someone know what the problem is and how I can solve itp  pstrongEditstrong Ive created a new minimal working example and unfortunately cannot reproduce the discrepancy between Qt 4.8 and Qt 5.2.

Negative 1241 pI have a page, including WebView. I had codeandroidconfigChanges...orientationscreenSizecode in manifest and in worked perfectly well I scroll view to a particular text, and when screen orientation changes, the WebView is positioned to the same text on the top this is not same as preserving ScrollY,  because of changed width.p  pNow I changed the design and have different layouts for horizontal and vertical orientation. I prefer to remove orientationscreenSize for the activity to allow reconstructing the page when orientation changes. Everything works fine, but I need to restore the text offset manually.p  pThe closest I could find is  codegetOffsetForPositiongetScrollX, getScrollYcode for saving offset and  codebringPointIntoViewoffsetcode  for restoring offset, however these function are not backwardcompatible getOffsetForPosition wants API 3, while bringPointIntoView requires API 14 . In addition they apply to TextView and may be inaccurate with WebView because of HTML tags.p  pTried codeWebView.saveStatecode and codeWebView.restoreStatecode called after the page has been loaded. Doesnt seem to work for me.p  pYes, I can get calculate scroll position using Paint and FontMetrics, but this is a dirty trick. Ideally, I prefer to get all parameters from the system and keep the code as much backward compatible as possible.p

Negative 1241 pHow can I transform values of three separate variables in R to create new values in a single, combined variable I have experimental data with three conditions, negative, control, and pro. The data in raw form gives information about who was in what condition each participantrow could only be in each condition by putting a 1 next to a variable named for that condition, then the value is missing if a participant was not in that condition. I would like to create a single variable called Manip, with values of 1 for those with the value of 1 in the negative condition, 0 for those with a value of 1 in the control condition, and 1 for those in the pro condition.

Negative 1241 pI am reading an XML file into a stringstream buffer in order to parse it using RapidXML.

Negative 1241 pIn my project, I want to somehow display a pdf file on the page. For this, I am trying to use the codeltobjectgtcode tag. So far, so good, since the pdf lives in the codepubliccode folder in my Rails app.p  pThe problem is that now I want the user to be able to display a pdf that is on his pc. I tried using Javascript to alter the codeltobjectgtcode tag, but that does not work since Rails generates a new GET request to get the file, and the file is not on the server. Any ideas of how I can solve this p  pI have tried using PDF.js, but it does not integrate well in the assets pipeline. Also, I would have to customize and hack the code to add some other functionalities, so PDF.js is kinda off the table at least for now.p

Negative 1241 pHere is what the ideal goal is.p  pWe have a simulink model and while it is running we want all the outcome values to be sent to our vb.net application.p  pI think I have found a few ways but prior to diving in would like some input. I havent used matlab or simulink in the past which is making this harder than it is.p  pThere is a COM object for matlab but that doesnt allow for real time access to variables while simulink is running. Simulink only dumps its data to matlab after it is completed.p  pOption 1 Callback I have been reading and it seems I am able to add a callback to the blocks so as the values is sent to matlab based on a timer. I would then have to make constant calls to matlab from vb to get these values. This doesnt seem efficient and would likely take up to much resources with simulnk running at the same time a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1245173howdoigetdatafromasimulinkblockintoamatlabguiHow do I get data from a Simulink block into a MATLAB GUIap  pOption 2  I found a Simulink Coder on the mathworks website and seems like the ideal solution but would like some clarification if anyone here has used it. I have requested a trial but still have a few more hoops to jump through before I get it.p  pIt seems to me like the coder would take the simulink model and create the algorithm in CC code Does this then mean I can create a C application and use that code as a source So instead of running simulink with my application I would just run the code and input the parameters to give us the output variablep  pI have also been reading some info about matlab outputing DLLs or mux so can be used with .net applicationsp  pAny inputopinions are appreciated  p
Negative 1241 pI am running a simulation where i generate huge 2d sparse matrices and hence i use FIND function to only store nonzero values with their indices. p  pNow for each iteration of for loop i generate such matrix and because they are all of different length I use cellarray to store these configurations.

Negative 1241 pI created a WCF project WCF Service Application and I added a method that returns test JSON data. In that same project, I created a emReportsem folder and, within that folder, I created a webform Report.aspx which includes a JS file which does the WCF calls and some html, which is ultimately, a simple kendo donut. Theres no codebehind. Im including the WCF code so I dont get downvote for not having codep  precode[OperationContract] [WebInvokeMethod  GET, ResponseFormat  WebMessageFormat.Json, BodyStyle  WebMessageBodyStyle.WrappedRequest, UriTemplate  ShowValues] System.IO.Stream ShowValues codepre  pandp  precodepublic System.IO.Stream ShowValues    DataTable dt  new DataTable   dt.Columns.AddPenetration, typeofint   DataRow row  dt.NewRow   row[Penetration]  97   DataRow row2  dt.NewRow   row2[Penetration]  3   dt.Rows.Addrow   dt.Rows.Addrow2   return Conversions.ConvertToJsondt  codepre  pEverything here works fine the WCF call through the browser returns the correct data and the JS call consumes that data correctly. In other words, the simple kendo donut is displayed. In this scenario, everything is in the same project and everything works fine.p  pSince I dont want to have my kendo webform and my WCF in the same project, I created an ASP.Net Empty Web Application that will only have Report.aspx. So after creating the project, I did what I did in the first project I created emReportsem folder and copied everything from one folder to the other Report.aspx amp associated files, Kendo files, etc.p  pFor some reason, even though the WCF call is made it stops at breakpoint, the graphics arent shown. The only difference is that the new project includes all the files and folders of a project web.config, binobjother folders, csproj, etc. But aside from that, both Reports folders are exactly the same.p  pSo my question is should these files be in the same project as the WCF service What am I missingp  pThanks.p

Negative 1241 pI followed a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvpMLc4IXmYfgthisa tutorial to make an image uploader. It works fine, except when I try to upload larger file sizes It just changes the file size to 64KB and only displays a small part of a larger image.

Negative 1241 pI am using the profiler from VS2012 Ultimate, with the Instrumentation option for timing. My problem is that it reports functions doing the most work, which end up being the functions that are executed most often, not the the slowest, which is not very helpful.p  pFor example, the Hot Path lists items with Elapsed inclusive time being high , but the Elapsed Exclusive Time is 0. I want to only filter by Exclusive Time and actual ms time and not . Functions doing the most Individual Work are Exclusive time  which is better, but I still only care about the Individual Exclusive time ms with maybe the slowest times listed in the hot path.p  pIf I go into function details I can find average execution time, specifically exclusive which lists the slowest function taking .5 ms on average. This might seem good, but I also know that the .5 ms average means that from 1000 samples, maybe 900 take no time at all and a handful might take a second or more.p  pso, is there a way to have the VS2012 profiler, to look at only execution time, and not just the averages but also the worst case time so I can trace what is actually slowing it down.p  pVS2012 highlights lines of code based the  of call, can I also range this highlighting and all hotpath information to be based on ms time and not sample percentagesp  pAlso, if VS cannot do this kind of profiling, but another program can with VS I would very much like to know about it.p  pThank you.p

Negative 1241 pI have created a custom Google Map using gmap v3 api.  The map can be found at a hrefhttpdublinvisitorcentre.iedublinmap relnofollowhttpdublinvisitorcentre.iedublinmapa.p  pThe coordinates on the map are broken into 4 main areas  Things To Do, Travel, Food and Where to Stay.  I have created these via 4 Custom Post Types which all include various taxonomies to categorise each area.  p  pInside each location, I have added Custom Meta Boxes to allow the owners of the site enter Titles, Descriptions, Coordinates, Images etc of the locations.p  pThese details are then fed onto the map and the marker displays when a website user selects one or more of the taxonomies from each Custom Post Type.p  pMy issue is that every point is added into the code, causing thousands and thousands of lines of data.  This then causes the map to load extremely slow and the owners of the site have even more markers to add.p  pAnother issue is that each location can be spread out amongst multiple taxonomies and CPTs, so they are duplicating on the map, adding to the download time.p  pIs there a way to load these items any betterquicker than I currently am.  p  pI am afraid that my knowledge has taken me as far as I can go with this unless there is something obvious I am missing.p  pSnippet of Map JS for one markerp  precodeTHINGS TO DO var theatreShowsMarkers  new Array  Theatre BUILDINGS     for var i  0 i lt theatreShowsLocations.length i        var theatreShowsMarker  new google.maps.Marker         position theatreShowsLocations[i].latlng,         icon thingspin,         map map,         theatreShowsMarkers.pushtheatreShowsMarker         theatreShowsMarker.setMapnull  INFO WINDOW     google.maps.event.addListenertheatreShowsMarker, click, functiontheatreShowsMarker, i    return function      infowindow.setContenttheatreShowsLocations[i].info     infowindow.openmap, theatreShowsMarker     theatreShowsMarker, i HIDE MARKER FUNCTION     function clearHistoric        if theatreShowsMarkers for var i  0, n  theatreShowsMarkers.length i lt n i          theatreShowsMarkers[i].setMapnull SHOW MARKER FUNCTION     function showHistoric        if theatreShowsMarkers for var i  0, n  theatreShowsMarkers.length i lt n i          theatreShowsMarkers[i].setMapmap SHOWHIDE CHECKBOX     jQuerytheatrecheckbox.changefunction       if jQuerytheatrecheckbox.propchecked         showHistoric             elseclearHistoric codepre  pSnippet from Map Templatep  precode    ltTHEATRE SHOWS INFO BOXgt         ltdiv styledisplay nonegt             ltphp i  1 gt             ltphp args  array posttype gt things, thingscategories gt theatreshows   gt                     ltphp loop  new WPQuery args  gt             ltphp while  loopgthaveposts   loopgtthepost gt             ltphp if  getpostmetapostgtID, customlatlng, true     gt                 ltdiv idtheatreshowsinfoboxltphp echo i gtgt                                        ltInfo Box Contentgt                     ltphp include mapinfobox.phpgt                     ltInfo Box Contentgt                 ltdivgt             ltphp endif gt             ltphp i gt             ltphp endwhile gt             ltphp wpresetquery gt         ltdivgt     lttheatreshows INFO BOXgt  lttheatreshows MARKERgt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt         var theatreShowsLocations  [             ltphp  i  1 gt             ltphp args  array posttype gt things, thingscategories gt theatreshows   gt              ltphp loop  new WPQuery args  gt             ltphp while  loopgthaveposts   loopgtthepost gt             ltphp if  getpostmetapostgtID, customlatlng, true     gt                 latlng  new google.maps.LatLngltphp echo getpostmetapostgtID, customlatlng, true gt,                  info  document.getElementByIdtheatreshowsinfoboxltphp echo i gt,,             ltphp endif gt             ltphp i endwhile gt             ltphp wpresetquery gt]     ltscriptgt lttheatreshows MARKERgt codepre  pThis code is then repeated for all the taxonomiesmarkers.

Negative 1241 pIm currently developing my coding skills by practicing Object Oriented Programming.p  pI am working with a lot of SQL connections in order to retrieve information to initialize my class objects. I believe I am not doing well though, due to the amount of SQL connections I initialize at the same time. I often need to run several connections at the same time in order to complete initializing my main class. Below is a short example of what I mean.p  pI have got several classes. Each class has several properties of a different class type. Heres a short example of how it looks mostlyp  precodepublic class UserAccount      public long UserId  get set      public string UserName  get set      public Address UserAddress  get set  public class UserAddress      public long AddressId  get set      public string Address  get set   codepre  pNow, in order to retrieve information about each one of these classes, I am using specific methods which extract the value of each class property from my database. Here is how my method looks for the class strongUserAccountstrongp  precodepublic static UserAccount GetUserAccountByIdlong id      UserAccount result  null     using SqlConnection con  new SqlConnectionConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[connectionString].ConnectionString              using SqlCommand cmd  new SqlCommandstring.Empty, con                      cmd.CommandText  SELECT  FROM UserAccounts WHERE UserId  Id             cmd.Parameters.AddWithValueId, id             con.Open             using SqlDataReader reader  cmd.ExecuteReader                              if reader.Read                     result  RetrieveFromDatabaseRowreader                          con.Close                   return result  public static UserAccount RetrieveFromDatabaseRowSqlDataReader reader      try              return new UserAccount                      UserId  longreader[UserId],             UserName  stringreader[UserName],             UserAddress  UserAddress.GetUserAddressByIdlongreader[PrimaryAddressId]                   catch Exception unhandledException              GlobalMethods.LogExceptionunhandledException         return null       codepre  pNow the UserAddress.GetUserAddressById method is pretty much the same as the extraction method of my first class. It initializes a connection and runs an SQL command.p  pWhy do I think Im doing it wrong The current way its being executing at this point causes several SQL connections to be open at the same time in my example its only 2, but theres many more in my actual project.p  pI was thinking about making one huge SQL statement which joins all of the needed SQL tables in one single command, and then extracts all of that information in order to initialize the main class without requesting additional information from its properties the UserAddress class for instance. But then its not funny good to me because often I need to retrieve much information at the same time, and sometimes one statement wont be enough. Besides, its a pain in the ass to write one heck of a huge SQL statement which JOINs ten tables.p  pI was thinking about making one global SqlConnection variables which will be initialized only once, and all of my SQL queries will go through him all the time, at the same time. I dont know how it would react to such actions, though.p  pI could use some tips and hints on how to execute this properly. Thank you in advance.p

Negative 1241 pId like to develop an indoor positioning system for iOS by using WiFi signals instead of codeiBeaconcode.

It saysp  blockquote   pYou can sign up to learn more about how you can work with Apple to enable indoor positioning at your venue. Provide us with some basic information about your venue to get started. p blockquote  pand it leads to a hrefhttpsmapsconnect.apple.comreturnTo2Findoor relnofollowApple Maps Connecta, where you provide some information regarding the venue youd want to enable for indoor positioning. I sent the request some weeks ago and I have no response yet, since they say they have a large amount of requests and they are prioritizing according to several conditions.p  pHowever, Im not sure if this request through codeApple Maps Connectcode is just to get more information from Apple of how to develop an indoor positioning app, or it is because yo need to be granted their explicit permission to do that, or why. Has somebody already completed this processp  pOn the other hand, the only information dealing with indoor positioning, apart from codeiBeaconcode related, is this a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiossamplecodefootprintIntroductionIntro.html relnofollowsample codea.p  pTo make sure the WiFienabled indoor positioning is only available starting from iOS 8 Just developing it will be enough, or is it needed to request any kind of specific permission to enable an indoor positioning based app for WiFi signalsp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1241 pI am migrating data from MySQL to MongoDB.p  pThe MySQL is not optimized at all no indices so my operations, 1 plain sql query and 1 sql sequelize query take 30 secs each and return 300k documents each.p  pI am not worried about the MySQL part though, but about the nodemongo part.p  pWhen inserting them into MongoDB, I have tried a couple of thingsp  ul liusing native driver and arrayinserts, I dont see any problems, it is fast. I simply aggregate the query results into several midsize arrays lt16MB and insert them. But I want to do upserts rather than inserts to not destroy modified data, and that is not supported for bulk operations.li liusing mongoose and single upserts, the node process slowly goes towards the mem limit I gave it 3GB and then seems to stall there. After 30 mins, there is little visible progress, mongodb process is at 0 CPU. I think it typically finishes at some point a lot later, if it has enough memory for the given amount of data.li liusing native driver and single upserts, the whole process is running very slowly, but at least finishing. Watching the CPU usage in Task Manager Windows System, I can see that the mysql is using CPU when it is supposed to when I start the 2 queries, the 2nd after the first one is finished and all results have been inserted into mongodb at least from the node side, since they have not actually arrived by then and that Mongod is showing CPU load briefly at the beginning, but then it stays at 0, while node.js is grabbing more and more memory. Only much later the mongod seems to pick up again, and at some point the memory usage of node reverses and goes back to normal by the time that mongod also is coming back to 0 CPU. Strangely, by that time, all my queriesupserts are finished a long time ago, and the actual work from what I can see from CPU usage as well as from the actual data in mongodb by having shell open at same time and counting the expected objects is only happening afterwards with huge memory and CPU load node process maxes 1 core with CPU load during most of the operation.li ul  pWell, the 3rd case above is most interesting to me, since it is working, giving me what I want, it just behaves not really understandably.p  pHow come that the real work is only done long after I called the updatep  pI also eliminated write concerncallback in order to speed up the process, and it seems to have helped a little bit.p  pA typical upsert look something like thisp  precode connectionb.update isbn13 book.isbn13 ,       addToSet  ratedByUsers insertuserrating  ,       w 0  codepre  pandp  precode    connectionu.updateinsertuser,      addToSet  ratedBooks insertbookrating  ,      upsert true, w 0  codepre  pAlso, I do not think I have a memory leak, since overall, later on I find the memory to go down back to a few 100MBs again. Not here  I attribute that to the GC being lazy. I did run the operation repeatedly though and saw that the memory goes down substantially again.p  hr  pI try to illustrate the behavior better you can see the 2 peaks in the MySQL CPU consumption, which I would expect since I make 2 queries.p  pThe MongoD peaks irratically.p  pMongoD and MySQL use very little memory all the time.p  pThe node is running full1CPU just about all the time, with the memory first rapidly increasing and then slowly decreasing.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2EdZS.png altcpu and mem consumptionp  pI would expect the node.js to do less work and the mongod to be constantly busy trying to insert the data. Also, I am surprised at the timing node says it is finished with all operations after 2 minutes all my code ran through  but at that point hardly any data is in the mongodb.p  pAm I doing something wrongp  pHow to decrease nodes memory and CPU consumption and speed up the time by which the data finally arrives in mongodbp  hr  pAdded Real codep  pdeleted a lot, like models and query which I deem irrelevant. connectionu and connectionb are mongodb connections to the users and books collections.p  pFirst, all books are imported, then all users are imported  due to mysql DB structure, I use ratings which determines which users I am interested in and also updates the books collection again with the ratings.p  precode    sequelize.queryqstring.successfunction result          var len  result.length         result.forEachfunction ProcessRatingResultoneresult               var insertobject                   isbn13 oneresult.isbn13,                 title oneresult.title,                          cntwrite             connectionb.update isbn13 oneresult.isbn13 , insertobject,  upsert true, w 0               only start 2nd part if first part is completely finished  135s runtime             if cntwrite  len  1                   start with slight delay  give mongonode time to catch up                 setTimeoutImportRating, 10000 2500                                 function ImportRating          SQLRating.findAll where , include [SQLUser, SQLBook] .successfunction sqlresult              async.eachsqlresult, function ProcessRatingResultoneresult                  var book  oneresult.book                 var user  oneresult.user                 var rating  oneresult.rating                 function book, user, rating                      var insertuser                           joined user.created,                         externalid user.externalid                                           var insertbookrating                           book book.isbn13,                         rating rating                                           connectionu.updateinsertuser,                                  addToSet  ratedBooks insertbookrating  ,                                  upsert true, w 0                       var insertuserrating                           user user.externalid,                         rating rating                                           connectionb.update isbn13 book.isbn13 ,                              addToSet  ratedByUsers insertuserrating  ,                              w 0                  book, user, rating                              ,                 function err                  throw err                                         codepre

Why do we do it For example if codeargscode is code0code we connect to the codelocalhostcode, but what happens in the else is eluding me. I know that  codeargscode contains the supplied commandline arguments as an array of String objects, but that doesnt help me much. So any explanation is welcomed  p

Negative 1241 pGot a SharePoint List permissions question for you.p  pWhat I have is a huge list. One of the columns in this list has a PersonGroup thats responsible for that item. p  pThe administrator creates the records rows and assigns each row to a person, whose username goes into the PersonGroup columnp  pI want SharePoint to allow the person in that column to have access to only see and edit that particular row. In other words, unless the person has been assigned to a row by the site administrator, they wont be able to see the row or edit it.p  pExamplep  precode  Title  Data 1  Data 2  Data 3  Person responsible    A           1       2       3  Steve                B           4       5       6  Harry                C           7       8       9  Sally                D          10      11      12  Steve                codepre  pSo in this table, Steve can only see and edit Row A and D. Harry can see and edit only column B. Sally can see and edit only column C.p  pWhats the easiest way to achieve this, please If it can be achieved at all.p  pI apologise if this is trivialduplicate question.p  pP.s. Im using SharePoint 2003 I know.. I know.. Please dont hate me. Its not my decision.p  pThanks v. much.p

Negative 1241 pIm reposting this question to see if there is any currentadditional information, or if the old information still stands so this might be somewhat of a duplicate post because Im looking for updated information.p  pI am working with the free Crystal Reports for .NET Framework 4.0, Crystal Reports Version 11 with Visual Studio 2013.  I would like to display my data in a table format, with gridlines, where I can conditionally suppress various columns.  I know how to add lines and borders to make the displayfield objects  look like a table, but conditionally suppressing a field object still leaves a spacegap between columns.  If I use Microsofts Report Viewer I can add a Tablix object which allows me to add gridlines and conditionally hide columns and rows without leaving the blank space holder.  Is there a way to do this in CRp  pI have not found a way to make CrossTabs work for me as some postings have suggested, as I do not need totals, I just want to list the rows in my DataTable, and again I need to conditionally suppress columns.  p  pI have also noticed that with Crystal Reports I am unable to add subreports to subreports, but with Microsoft Reports I can nest subreports.p  pThis option 2 is an interesting way to suppress columns, but certainly not preferred. [a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2445829hidecolumnsincrystalreportatruntimerq1][1]hide columns in crystal report at run timeap  pI havent found any recent posts that discuss this table issue, so Im posting the question again in case something has changed in the last few years.p  pOld Postsp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3165795creatingtableswithincrystalreportsCreating tables within Crystal Reportsap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3913277howtodisplaygridofdataincrystalreportsHow to display grid of data in crystal reportsa a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4316249creatingatableincrystalreportsbasiconebuiltinvs2008Creating a table in Crystal Reports Basicone built in vs2008ap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2445829hidecolumnsincrystalreportatruntimerq1hide columns in crystal report at run timeap  pI dont know if a higher version nonfree of Crystal Reports has the table functionality that Im wanting, or if I just need to switch to Microsoft reports.  p  pI would appreciate your feedback.

Negative 1241 pI find that there is lag or a delay on some of my Android apps, and Ive checked a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingarticlesperftips.html relnofollowthe Android websitea to see how I could improve performance. However, the article mentioned avoiding using internal getters and setters. Would external getters and setters also slow down the performance speed of the appp  pIdeally, I would like to keep using custom objects in my app where I create an object and then call get methods from it, so is there any way to improve performance but keep objects. Would it be more efficient to get an array of values and assigning each index of it to a variable, or should I have multiple get methods in my object, and assign variables to those.p

Negative 1241 pI have a text file which may contain one or up to 400 numbers. Each number is separated by a comma and a semicolon is used to indicate end of numbers stream.  At the moment I am reading the text file line by line using the fgets. For this reason I am using a fixed array of 1024 elements the maximum characters per line for a text file.  This is not the ideal way how to implement this since if only one number is inputted in the text file, an array of 1024 elements will we pointless.  Is there a way to use fgets with the malloc function or any other method to increase memory efficiencyp

Negative 1241 pIm in the process of making a Sudoku solver sans walkthroughcheating with the algorithm. Essentially, my hypothetical function works as followsp  ol liTaking a grid as an argument, use basic logic relying on their being only 1 possible location for a value to solve it as far as possible without guessingdoing more complicated logic.li liOnce a point is reached where there are no obvious values, find a cell with the minimum possibilities of codencodeusually 2, clone the grid codencode times and substitute the possibilities into the cell, then call the function again for each new grid.li liIf a grid ever has a contradiction, terminate that function call.li liIf the grid is solved, set the class variable codesolvedGrid[][]code equal to the solved grid.li ol  pIn this setup, I would make the class, call the function, and then retrieve the answer from the codesolvedGrid[][]code field. My recursive function itself has a codevoidcode return, or perhaps I can make it codebooleancode in order to establish that the solution is found. Either way, I cant think of a way to return the codebyte[][]code since I will be calling the function multiple times from 1 function instance. Thank you in advance.p  pAlso, to anybody whos created such a program  would my proposed algorithm actually workp

Negative 1241 pI have an application which is centered around data per team.  A user belongs to a team and if they log in they only see that teams data.p  pHowever,  I now have super users who essentially belong to more than one team.  These users should be able to log in to the system and then immediately choose which team they are interested in.  From then on they will essentially viewcreate data against that selected team. They should also have the option to go and change what team they are viewing at any time.p  pIve established that the user would like to be able to have multiple tabs open and be viewing a different team in each tab. p  pIm struggling to work out the best way to accomplish this with .NET MVC while keeping it as stateless and testable as possible.p  pIve been reading up on the different ways to persist data  session state and cookies seem to get a bad rep in MVC.

That is because my threads are using some conditional variables and waiting for some other tasks to complete. Seems like that emdojoinem method is waiting for just joined thread to complete.p  pThe same thing happens if I try to do emforeachem directly in the emmainem function. p  pThe idea is to be able to join all these threads to the strongmainstrong thread, not to that lets say emdojoinems method thread which I suppose happened here. I could of course join and create them separately, because actually I dont need them to be in a vector the number of threads is known from the beginning, but I need a vector because each thread in my application is actually created using different methods parameters which I did not included in that sample code. I just do not want a new line for every single thread being created and joined.p  pThank you for any helpp  pEdit Maybe worth mentioning is that Im using Ubuntu.p
Negative 1241 pSorry for the vague title, but my issue is a bit complicated to explain. p  pI have written a captive portal for a WLAN access point in cherrypy, which is just a server that blocks MAC addresses from accessing the internet before they have registered at at certain page. For this purpose, I wrote some iptables rules that redirect all HTTP traffic to mep  precodesudo iptables t mangle N internet sudo iptables t mangle A PREROUTING i DEVIN p tcp m tcp dport 80 j internet sudo iptables t mangle A internet j MARK setmark 99 sudo iptables t nat A PREROUTING i wlan0 p tcp m mark mark 99 m tcp dport 80 j DNAT todestination 10.0.0.1 codepre  pthe specifics of this setup are not really important for my question, just note that an internet chain is created which redirects HTTP to port 80 on the access pointp  pAt port 80 on the AP, a cherrypy server serves a static landing page with a register button that issues a POST request to a hrefhttp10.0.0.1agree relnofollowhttp10.0.0.1agreea . To process this request, I have created a method like thisp  precodecherrypy.expose def agreeself, kwargs      retrieve MAC address of client by checking ARP table     ip  cherrypy.request.remote.ip     mac  stros.popenarp a   strip    awk  print 4  .read     mac  mac.rstriprn      add an iptables rule to whitelist the client, rmtrack to remove previous connection information     os.popensudo iptables I internet 1 t mangle m mac macsource s j RETURN mac     os.popensudo rmtrack s ip      return openwelcome.html codepre  pSo this method retrieves the clients MAC address from the arp table, then adds an iptables exception to remove that specific MAC from the internet chain that redirects traffic to the portal.p  pNow when I test this setup, something interesting happens. Adding the exception in iptables works  i.e. the client can now access web pages without getting redirected to me. The problem is that the stronginitial requeststrong doesnt come through to my server , i.e. the page codewelcome.htmlcode is never opened  instead, right after the iptables and rmtrack calls are executed, the client tries to open the agree path on the page they requested before the redirect to my portal.p  pFor example, if they hit google.com in the address bar, then got sent to my portal and agreed, they would now try to open a hrefhttpgoogle.comagree relnofollowhttpgoogle.comagreea . As a result, they get an error after a while. It appears that the iptables or the rmtrack call changes the request to go for the original destination strongwhilestrong it is still being processed at my server, which doesnt make any sense to me. Consequently, it doesnt matter which static page I return or which redirects I make after those terminal commands have been issued  the return value of my function isnt used by the client.p  pHow could I fix this problem Every piece of useful information is appreciated.p

Negative 1241 pI have read a lot about running multiple slaves on a host machine that has the Jenkins master running on it, however, I am a bit confused on how to move forward. I want the Jenkins server to call slaves whenever it is possible in order to distribute the workload. In my case, each Jenkins slave will be building scripts from Unity3d projects. I have installed an Ubuntu VM on my mac where the master Jenkins server is and would like to know how to set it up. p  pWould I use another OS on the slave VMp  pIn addition, I am running the VM on VirtualBox, is this the best option or would another VM be better fit for this jobp  pFinally, if someone knows how to set this up, would it be possible for them to state how to set up a slave on the same machine as the server and connect both of them through sshp

Negative 1241 pSo Im beginning to learn the basics of Grand Central Dispatch and the whole concept of multithreading with iOS applications. Every tutorial will tell you that you must run UI events on the main thread, but I dont completely understand why. p  pHeres a problem I came across yesterday, and finally fixed it by running a segue on the main thread, but I still dont understand why running it off the main thread was a problemp  pI had a custom initial VC barcode scanner and a segue to a new view controller with a codeUIWebViewcode attached. As soon as the VC found a barcode, it called a handler, and in that closure, I had a codeperformSegueWithIdentifiercode. However, I got a codeEXCBADACCESScode because of this it didnt happen when the second VC had a label or a codeUIImageViewcode, just with codeUIWebViewcode. I finally realized that for some reason, the closure was called off the main thread, and thus the segue was being performed off the main thread. Why exactly would performing the segue on another thread throw a memory error Is it because codeselfcode in codeself.performSegueWithIdentifiercode was somehow nil And why wouldnt Swift automatically dispatch a segue event on the main threadp

Negative 1241 pI have the following problem. I have a relative large number of excel charts, and I want to be able to change the size of the charts i.e. width and height automatically. By automatically I mean the following I have two cells, one for height and one for width, and when I change them, the charts change automatically, without having to push any other button or anything. For example, cell A1 has the value 100 for width and cell B1 has the value 200 for the height. So, when I change A1 to 200 and B1 to 300 I get all my charts to get bigger. p  pwhat I have done up to now is to be able to loop over all charts, and change the shapes, but I need to hit a button first for my macro to run. I would like to find out if there is a way to change the shape of the charts without having to push any button, just by changing the values of the two cells that have the width and the height of the charts. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 1241 pPlaying around with vue.js 0.12.  Looking for the best way to bind data to d3. In the example [materials] ultimately holds the parameters to generate the data D3 plots, which are plotted as different series using D3.  I use vue to manage the input  deletion  editing of the parameters used to generate the data and pass those parameters to a function which generates the data which then calls D3 to plot on a specified  tag.  p  pThis works.

Is this the correct way, or is there a better way of doing this  The downside is I have to use vue.js to keep track of updates to the data and redraw D3 chart.  If I use D3 to handle removing data from graphs in an interactive way, in my usecase, I get out of sync with the vue model not sure how to link D3 to vue data model.p  pAdvice definitely appreciated. p

Negative 1241 pI suspect this is a rather common scenario and may show my ineptitude as a DB developer, but here goes anyway ...p  pI have two tables strongProfilesstrong and strongHiddenProfilesstrong and the strongHiddenProfilesstrong table has two relevant foreign keys emprofileidem and emhiddenprofileidem that store emidems from the strongProfilesstrong table.p  pAs you can imagine, a user can stronghidestrong another user wherein his profile ID would be the emprofileidem in the strongHiddenProfilesstrong table or he can be stronghiddenstrong by another user wherein his profile ID would be put in the emhiddenprofileidem column. Again, a pretty common scenario.p  pstrongDesired Outcomestrongbr I want to do a join or to be honest, whatever would be the most efficient query on the Profiles and HiddenProfiles table to find all the profiles that a given profile is both not hiding AND not hidden from.p  pIn my head I thought it would be pretty straightforward, but the iterations I came up with kept seeming to miss one half of the problem.

This is happening primarily in html5 mode and when width is not multiple of tile size for a particular zoom level.p  pTo support different zoom levels, we tried to follow pyramid structure that is halving world size for each zoom level until we fit in last tile size.p  pThat is say if i have an image of size 10752 X 5376 and tile size is say 256. We are creating below pyramid.p  precode10752 x 5376, 5376 x 2688, 2688 x 1344, 1344 x 672, 672 x 336, 336 x 168, codepre  pOne observation we had is, as long as width at each zoom level is multiple of tile size and half its above level, we do not see any distortion at the panorama joining area on browser. We can make sure worldSizes width multiple of tileSize but making it all other zoom levels multiples of tilesize may not happen.p  pPlease help us how to achieve managing zooms without any distortion. Do not found much documentation around this. This problem is majorly occurring in html5 mode.p

Negative 1241 pI have some devices attached to the same network. All of them runs a TCP server. I have my PC also connected to the same network. I need to collect data from the other devices. So Im about to write an app in Qt framework which does that. I will exchange small packets with the devices, so I thought I make a generic object for devices which has a QTcpSocket member, and I use signals and slots for receiving data. I have an other class which I use to connect to devices. It inherits QObject and QRunnable. the QRunnabless run method implements the connecting procedure and it looks like thisp  precodeQTcpSocket socket  socket.connectToHostthisgthostAddress, thisgtportNumber  ifsocket.waitForConnected      emit ConnectedthisgtdeviceId, socket.socketDescriptor  else      emit ErrorthisgtdeviceId  codepre  pThis function is run in a separate thread using QThreadPool to avoid long delay due to connecting timep  precodeConnector connector  new ConnectorhostAddress, port, id  connectconnector, ampConnectorConnected, this, ampCommunicationLayerConnected connectconnector, ampConnectorError, this, ampCommunicationLayerError  QThreadPoolglobalInstancegtstartconnector codepre  pAnd when the Connected signal is fired, I instantiate a device object for that specific idp  precodethisgtdevices.pushbacknew Deviceid, socketDescriptor, this  connectthisgtdevices.back, ampDeviceDataReceived, this, ampCommunicationLayerDataReceived codepre  pThe sockets descriptor is passed as an argument and then when the Device object is instantiated, and I call QTcpSocketsetSocketDescriptor on the socket inside the device object with that argument.p  pMy problem is that sometimes I got strange messages QSocketNotifier Invalid socket 7 and type Read, disabling... QSocketNotifier Invalid socket 7 and type Write, disabling...p  pSometimes I dont get anything and it just works, sometimes I get both, sometimes just one of them. I am a bit clueless.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pI think I found whats a problem because Im declaring the socket in the run function as an auto variable, it goes out of scope as the function returns, so the socket descriptor is invalid. And because its running in a separate thread sometimes my device is constructed before the function returns and this way the socket descriptor remains valid. I made the socket object in run function a pointer, it works now, but I dont know if it could cause a memory leak. Any ideas If I use a smart pointer to manage the sockets lifetime, I get the same result as before with the auto variablep
