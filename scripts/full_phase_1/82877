Positive 82877 pI am working on a project that animates single words in quick succession with varying degrees of speed. I have built something quick and dirty using strongjQuerystrongs code.animatecode and callbacks to make this animation.p  pYou can see an example here on stronga hrefhttpcodepen.ioanonpenyYadpm relnofollowCodepenastrong and the code below too pretty big.p  pI am wondering how I can convert this to using strongGSAPstrong. Below is what I am currently working on as a replacement for strongjQuerystrongs code.animatecode and also a Codepen of that version is stronga hrefhttpcodepen.ioanonpenYyGoLE relnofollowhereastrongp  precodeTweenMax.staggerFromTo.frame, 1,  opacity 0, delay 1 ,  opacity 1, delay 1 , 1 codepre  pAs you can see my strongGSAPstrong version is not working correctly like my quick strongjQuerystrong one.p  pYou can also see that in my huge horrible strongjQuerystrong file that I can easily amend speeds for each frame which is very important, so Id need to be able to do this with the strongGSAPstrong version too.p  pCould anyone please help with a solution as to how I could do thisp  pstrongemHTMLemstrongp  precodeltdoctype htmlgt lthtml langengt     ltheadgt         ltmeta

Its great to sort any kind of data with as many tag as you would like. p  pI would like to ask you to have to have a look at the result and suggest how some animation can be added to it or maybe some external library, so the appearance and restructuring of blocks would look more smoother and natural. p  pFor example when I was trying to find something similar to this idea of filtering I found this great a hrefhttpdocs.haundodesign.commagnetanimationtypes relnofollowMagento plugina, the animation they have made are amazing, but unfortunately this plugin does not allow to filter data in 2 or more different tag lists. p  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodelth2gtCompositionlth2gt  ltul classfilter idcompositiongt     ltligtlta datavalueall classselectedgtAllltagt ltligt     ltligtlta datavaluelandscapegtLandscapeltagtltligt      ltligtlta datavalueportaitgtPortaitltagt ltligt     ltligtlta datavaluesquaregtSquareltagt ltligt ltulgt  lth2gtPeoplelth2gt ltul classfilter idpeoplegt     ltligtlta datavalueall classselectedgtAllltagt ltligt     ltligtlta datavaluepeoplegtPeopleltagtltligt      ltligtlta datavaluenopeoplegtNo Peopleltagtltligt ltulgt  lth2gtThemelth2gt ltul classfilter idthemegt     ltligtlta datavalueall classselectedgtAllltagt ltligt     ltligtlta datavalueNaturegtNatureltagtltligt      ltligtlta datavalueFashiongtFashionltagtltligt      ltligtlta datavalueMountainsgtMountainsltagtltligt      ltligtlta datavalueSeagtSealtagtltligt     ltulgt  lth2gtData to filterlth2gt      ltdiv classitem landscape people Naturegtltdivgt      ltdiv classitem portait nopeople Fashiongtltdivgt      ltdiv classitem landscape people Mountainsgtltdivgt      ltdiv classitem portait people Seagtltdivgt      ltdiv classitem square people Mountainsgtltdivgt      ltdiv classitem landscape people Fashiongtltdivgt      ltdiv classitem square nopeople Seagtltdivgt      ltdiv classitem landscape nopeople Mountainsgtltdivgt      ltdiv classitem portait people Fashiongtltdivgt      ltdiv classitem square nopeople Seagtltdivgt  codepre  pstrongCSSstrongp  precodeli     liststyle none    div      height 100px     width 100px     background grey     display inlineblock     opacity 1s     transition opacity 1s easeinout  codepre  pstrongJavaScriptstrongp  precodeul.filter li a     .onclick, function           var this  this         this             .closestul             .finda             .removeClassselected         this             .addClassselected         var selector  []         ul li a.selected             .eachfunction                  var selectedValue  this.datavalue                 if selectedValue  all                      selector.pushselectedValue                                       .item             .hide         if selector.length              .item. selector.join..show          else              .item                 .show                codepre  pJSFiddle a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.net22vh08ah13 relnofollowhttpsjsfiddle.net22vh08ah13ap

Positive 82877 pSo this question has been answered a few times and Ive tried the solutions and while they work, sort of, its not the way I would like. What I am trying to achieve is to have a container scroll its width when an arrow is hovered, pause and then repeat if it is still being hovered.p  pI currently have it working except that you have to move your mouse off the button and back on to get it to scroll again, and the animation seems to be adding up each time. If you hover for a split second, then again it will do the full animation twice, or, if you scroll the opposite direction it scrolls the distance of the total number of times the button has been hovered over. Is there a way to clear the cache or something Or am I making this more complicated than it could bep  pI have the working example in a hrefhttpcodepen.iodefineartpenEVypmN relnofollowCodePena and here is the relevant Javascriptp  precodefunction  var container  markerlist var scrollLeft  0 var scrollRight  0  function menuScrollLeft  scrollLeft  scrollLeft  container.width container.animate   scrollLeft scrollLeft ,    duration 1400,   queue false , linear   function menuScrollRight  scrollRight  scrollRight  container.width container.animate   scrollLeft scrollRight ,    duration 1400,   queue false , linear   function scrollStop  container.stop   after.hovermenuScrollLeft, scrollStop before.hovermenuScrollRight, scrollStop   codepre  pI have already tried simply completing the .animate with a callback to itself like thisp  precodefunction menuScrollLeft      container.animate         scrollLeft container.width     ,duration 1400, queue false, linear, menuScrollLeft  codepre  pBut that didnt work, it would scroll once and stop and then not work after that. The only other option Ive tried was to make scrollLeft a huge number like 100000 with a duration of 60000 and it would continuously scroll but that seemed impractical, and the markerlist can be longer or shorter depending on how many things are on the map.p  pAny help would be appreciatedp

Positive 82877 pIve recently implemented this HTML, CSS and jQuery code from MegaDrop. Like any dropdown menu, its supposed to show all the links when you hover over it.p  pPlease hover on Products to see the result.p  pThe problem starts when you hover away and when you hover again before the animation is finished, it will cut the height and remembers that. It will also not respond after you hover on and off a couple of times. Which is odd.p  pIve set no height in the container. I just let it render natively since the links have padding.p  pThe container has strongoverlay hiddenstrong as well.p  pTo enable the jQuery animation I need to remove strongdisplay blockstrong from strong.nav  lihover  divstrong p  pMy question is, how do I prevent this Do I need to give more instructions to the jQuery itself in order to retain the height of the container and not to shorten itp

Positive 82877 pI have a really strange problem I am using jQuery v11 on the latest Chrome on localhost. While I manage to use jQuery.animate on my website with any elements and features including opacity, I have one element that I just cant.p  pI tried to trigger the animation within and outside the document.ready function and they both resulted in the same thing. I tried with fadeTo, fadeInfadeOut, animate opacity, all of them the same thing. The animation starts but after a certain percentage it just doesnt continue and jumps right to the end. emI also tried it with e.g. padding and it works perfectly.emp  pI am using the callback too but removing or adding it did not affect performance on either cases. Also, I have browsed through dozens or even more questions already, so I feel I did my research.p  pThank you for your helpp  pJavaScriptp  precodenbcopy.stop.animate opacity 0 , 300, function  this.cssbackgroundposition, 16px.stop.animate opacity 1 , 300  codepre  pHTMLp  precodeltdiv idnotesbuttonsgt lta idnbcopy datainfogtCltagt ltdivgt codepre  pCSSp  precodedivnotesbuttons      width 18px     position absolute     top 180px     right 24px     opacity 0     filter alphaopacity0   divnotesbuttons a      cursor pointer     display block     width 18px     height 18px     marginbottom 1px      background red urldbsprite.png norepeat     backgroundposition 0px 0px  codepre  pNote I would like to use this animation in the following situation I am animating the opacity see, here it works... of the parent div, then when the nbcopy button is pressed, it fades out, changes the bg position and fades back.p  pIf I use really long animations 3000 and add a delay, the first animation interrupts after about 40, then after the 3000 ms are over, it counts the delay and then the new animation. This way I have no problem with the animation. Also, if I do not use the callback, it is working. But the two interrupt each other somehow...p  pif I only use the .css in the callback, it applies instantly the background position but the animation runs smoothly.p  pI already spent about 1.5 hours on such a small thing...

And it should animate everytime i click, but it does it only the first time after each page reload.p  pHere is a jsfiddle a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netsxybreakjouevx281 relnofollowhttpsjsfiddle.netsxybreakjouevx281ap  pHere is my codep  precodedocument.readyfunction      var angle     var i  0      previous.onclick, function           i1          carousel.animateborderSpacing 40,              duration slow,              step functionnow, fx                   this.css                transform rotateY  inow  deg,                webkittransform rotateY  inow  deg,                moztransform rotateY  inow  deg,                mstransform rotateY  inow  deg                        next.clickfunction       i1      carousel.animateborderSpacing 40,        duration slow,       step functionnow, fx           this.css             transform rotateY  inow  deg,             webkittransform rotateY  inow  deg,             moztransform rotateY  inow  deg,             mstransform rotateY  inow  deg                  codepre

Negative 82877 pOk, this is a weird one.p  pThe expected behaviour for a TreeView control is that, if ShowNodeToolTips is set to false, then, when a label for a tree node exceeds the width of the control or, more accurately, its right hand edge is past the right hand edge of the client area, then a tooltip is shown above the node showing the full items text. p  pId like to disable that, because the above semantic doesnt always work, depending on what the treeview is contained within. So I have rolled my own, and got the tooltips to work and line up better than the default one  but I would like to be able to disable the default behaviour for situations where it would work natively.p  pSo, can anyone point me in the right direction as to which message to post to the TreeView in order to disable that behaviour I have looked at the windows control reference, but couldnt find anything that looked like it might be the one.p

Negative 82877 pI am new to WCF programming and am finding the learning process rather frustrating.  As far as I can tell, WCF and WPF, for that matter will emhideem errors from you by default.  So far I have experienced the following problems and had essentially zero indication from Visual Studio or the runtime that there was anything wrong other than my application just not workingp  ul lia service reference not being uptodate why doesnt VS do this automaticallyli lia type in a service method could not be serializedli lithe service was trying to pass more data than the defaults allow.li ul  pPresumably there is some simple way of making these problems visible to me, the developer.  If anyone can tell me what it is, I would be very grateful hours of googling have not provided a working answerp  pI would also appreciate an explanation, if anyone knows, why the default behaviour for WCF and WPF is to quietly hide errors like this.  It seems bizarre, to say the least.p

Negative 82877 pLets assume I am in charge of developing a Scrabble game, being that one of the principal requirements of the client is the ability to later try out different ways and modes of the game. I already made a design that is flexible enough to support those kinds of changes. The only question left is what to expose to the clientobjects access modifiers, and how to organize it how to expose my objects in namespacespackages.p  pHow should I define things such that the client can both easily use my standard implementation a standard Scrabble game, and yet be able to make all the modifications that he wants I guess what I need is a kind of framework, on which he can work on.p  pI organized my classesinterfaces in a nonstrict layered systemp  h2Data Typesh2  pContains basic data types that might be used in the whole system. This package and its members can be accessed by anyone in the system. All its members are public.p  h2Domainh2  pContains all the interfaces Ive defined and that might be useful to be able to make clients new Scrabbles implementations. Also contains value types, like Piece, that are used in the game. All its members are public.p  h2Implementationsh2  pContains all the needed classescode to implement my standard Scrabble game in a Implementations.StandardScrabble package. If the client decides to implement other variants of the game, he can create them in Implementations.XYZ, for example. These classes are all package protected and the only thing that is available to the outside of the package is a Game faade. Uses both Domain and Data Types packages.p  h2UIh2  pContains the UI class that I have implemented so that both the client and the users of the program can run the game my implementation. Can access all the other layers.p  hr  pThere are several drawbacks to the way I am organizing things, the most obvious being that if the client wants to create its own version of the game, he will have to basically implement almost everything by himselfI share in the Domain the interfaces, but he can do almost nothing with them. I feel I should maybe pass all the Implementations classes to the Domain and then only have a Faade that builds up my standard Scrabble in the Implementations namespacep  pHow would you approach this Is there any recomended reading on how to build this kind of programs basically, frameworksp  pThanksp

Negative 82877 pIve build a ASP.NET MVC 3 RC at the moment site that uses OpenID login system. I was still learning about OpenID while implementing this so I commented the code heavily. The result is a site that lets users loginregister with OpenID, add other OpenIDs to their account and also remove them. This little project can be then used as a starting point for any new project that would use OpenID login system. It can also be used as a resource for people to learn OpenID with.p  pI decided to release this project as open source. This will be my first open source project and I need to decided what license to use. I want people to be able to use this for any purpose they wish for. They can learn from it, use it for commercial or noncommercial projects and make their own forks of the code. It would also be nice for others to be able to contribute back to the project with stuff like bug fixes on sites like GitHub. But Id like to be the copyright owner of the code that is under my control. For example the code that is in my GitHub repository Ill call this the main code base.

Negative 82877 pIm seeing a performance behavior in mysqld that I dont understand.p  pI have a table t with a primary key id and three data columns col1,  col4.p  pThe data are in 4 TSV files col1.tsv,  col4.tsv. The procedure I use to ingest them is p  precodeCREATE TABLE t    id INT NOT NULL,   col1 INT NOT NULL,   col2 INT NOT NULL,   col3 INT NOT NULL,   col4 CHAR12 CHARACTER SET latin1 NOT NULL   LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE       POP 1   col1.tsv INTO TABLE t id, col1    ALTER TABLE t ADD PRIMARY KEY id  SET GLOBAL hotkeys.keybuffersize  something suitable  CACHE INDEX t IN hotkeys  LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE t  DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tmpt CREATE TABLE tmpt  id INT NOT NULL, val INT NOT NULL  LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE col2.tsv INTO TABLE tmpt tt INSERT INTO t id, col2     POP 2    SELECT tt.id, tt.val FROM tmpt tt   ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE col2tt.val  DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tmpt CREATE TABLE tmpt  id INT NOT NULL, val INT NOT NULL  LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE col3.tsv INTO TABLE tmpt tt INSERT INTO t id, col3     POP 3   SELECT tt.id, tt.val FROM tmpt tt   ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE col3tt.val  DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tmpt CREATE TABLE tmpt  id INT NOT NULL,    val CHAR12 CHARACTER SET latin1 NOT NULL  LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE col4.tsv INTO TABLE tmpt tt INSERT INTO t id, col4     POP 4   SELECT tt.id, tt.val FROM tmpt tt   ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE col4tt.val codepre  pNow heres the performance thing I dont understand. Sometimes the POP 2 and 3 INSERT INTO  SELECT  ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE queries run very fast with mysqld  occupying 100 of a core and at other times mysqld bogs down at 1 CPU reading t.MYD, i.e. table ts MyISAM data file, at random offsets.p  pIve had a very hard time isolating in which circumstances it is fast and in which it is slow but I have found one repeatable casep  pIn the above sequence, POP 2 and 3 are very slow. But if I create t  without col4 then POP 2 and POP 3 are very fast. Whyp  pAnd if, after that, I add col4 with an ALTER TABLE query then POP 4 runs very fast too.p  pAgain, when the INSERTs run slow, mysqld is bogged down in file IO  reading from random offsets in table ts MyISAM data file. I dont even understand why it is reading that file.p  pMySQL server version 5.0.87. OS X 10.6.4 on Core 2 Duo iMac.p  hr  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI eventually found what I think is the answer to this question. The mysterious difference between some inserts being slow and some fast is dependent on the data.p  pThe clue was when the insert is slow, mysqld is seeking on average 0.5GB between reads on t.MYD. When it is fast, successive reads have tiny relative offsets.p  pThe confusion arose because some of the col.tsv files happen to have their rows in roughly the same order w.r.t. the codeidcode column while others are randomly ordered relative to them.p  pI was able to drastically reduce overall processing time by using sort1 on the tsv files before loading and inserting them.p

Negative 82877 pI have approached you today to try and gather your opinions and experience with speed related to reading from the internet with Java. First of all, please let me explain my situation so you have a better understanding as to why I asked this question.p  pI cant say too much due to legal things regarding my business that I shall be running soon but I will do my best to cover the main points. Basically, I have a program that runs off that users can contribute towards online.  I already I have a working version of this program in another programming langauge but I need to rewrite the program in Java  The program I have accesses the online data and then writes it too a file for offline use The data is stored in a MySQL database, currently, but if I was going too keep this method of accessing the data I would have to switch to Postgres. Hopefully you have enough information about what my program does for me now to go on to explaining my optionsp  pstrongOption 1  A  Databasestrong p  pFor this method I would be using the Postgres JDBC driver in the same way I accesed the data in my other program with MySQL.  Postgres because of licensing issues with MySQL  How I use it is simple, read a value then write a line containing the value to the file, until the end of the database is reachedp  pstrongOption 2  Plain Text Filestrongp  pThis will work in a similar way to option 1, the only difference is a  would be working with a standard old .txt file. I thought this method may be a bit simpler and easier considering I have no experience with Postgres, but that is not the main thing I want to focus on. For this option I would have two methods  if this option sounds best please could you tell me which method would be best , I could either download the text and read it on the computer to re write it how I need it or read straight from the internet  in that case I may use a HTML file instead of a TXT file  Either way I would process the data just like in option 1.p  pstrongWhat I need to focus onstrongp  pOkay, now you know just about everything, there just one more final bit of information i need to tell you and that is the main points I would like to focus on... And they arep  pSpeed  How long will it take to get the information and process itp  pSimplicity  How easy will this be to code in Java for me, and,p  pSecurity  This is more the online factor where people can contribute, I dont mind people like seeing a document with contributions in but I dont want people to see a password or anythingp  pI think thats about it now, so if you guys have got any comments or advice, etc they will all be highly appriciatedp

Negative 82877 pIm trying to understand the timing of the event loop with animate and DeferredCommand. Ive got LayoutPanel that has a navigation column on the left like Outlook and then the remainder of the screen can toggle between being split vertically between 2 panels, or the bottom panel when it is split can be set to fill the rest of the screen. Ive got the layouts and basic animation between them working, but Im trying to delay the resizing of the bottom screen with a DeferredCommand. The reason for this is that when going from fullscreen to half screen for the bottom panel, I want to resize the bottom panel strongafterstrong reducing it down to half size. If this doesnt happen, the bottom panel is resized to halfsize while still being displayed full screen, and then the animate happens.p  pHowever, this is exactly what is happening, and which I was trying to avoid with the DeferredCommand.

Negative 82877 pI know that generally injector should be used only once in all application on startup. But i have following use case. I inject task implementation for Executor, and then inside that task i have dependency lets say codeFileHandlercode that has to be instantiated each time. I know the way is to inject provider lets say codeFileHandlerProvidercode that will return new instance each time requested. The problem is that codeFileHandlercode has a lot of dependencies of it own lets say codeParsercode, codeOutputPrintercode.... Now those also need new instance each time because implementations could have some state, for example counters, and on next thread run reusing same instance would be a problem. The thing is that after provider is injected the same instance of provider is reused, so new codeFileHandlercode is always created with same codeParsercode and codeOuputPrintercode. The solution could be again to inject codeParserProvidercode  and codeOutputPrinterProvidercode instead of Parser and codeOuputPrintercode in codeFileHandlerProvidercode, but thats just not right, it gets too complicated soon, because there are more dependencies. The only simple solution I see now could be to use Injector in codeFileHandlerProvidercode, that would return new instance codeFileHandlercode and new instances of dependencies. Or maybe there is another more elegant solution in this situationp

Negative 82877 pHi all I am using Zend framework for my PHP project. Basically I have few actions that I want to run automatically. I will be using a cron job to do the trick. The cron job will run a php script file.p  pTill now everything seems normal. Now I have created a table in my database and have stored the actions that I need to run in it. For example I need to do the followingp  p1Create a sample file 5 times.p  p2Upload all sample files 1 time.p  p3send mail continuous.p  pSo I will store in my table the controller and action for creating a sample file and set its repeating time to 5 and set also its execution time. The same will be done for the other two actions.p  pNow the script file is run every minute. In the script file I will select all records that from the table that have an execution time equal to the current time then run them.p  pNow to make things just clear this system actually works but I was thinking about a better or improved scheduler techniques. Storing the scheduled actions in a table sound like a good idea but I was wondering if there was a superior approach p

But it only works well when firstly access the JApplet with JRE 6u24. operation as followsp  p1.open the JApplet.You can see the color of cell display BLUE.p  p2.on the IE page,refresh the component by pressing F5. You can see the content of the cell which is changed to BLUE is now display as BLANKp  pThen I unistall the JRE 6u24 and install JRE of other version. The conclusion is that the problem only happens with version after 6U22including 6U22.It works well with version before 6u21including 6u21.p  pSo it seems a bug of JRE of version 6U22. p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated p

Negative 82877 pOkay, as usual, Im brand new to this... been researching and trialerroring yes thats a verb for a couple hours with no luck.  I have two tables.  strongApplicationstrong and strongApplicationTypestrong.  strongApplicationTypestrong lists all the possible types.  Lets use colors for simplicity.

Negative 82877 pFor anyone who is struggling with how to get ie9 to read an xml file from the server, and not from cache, heres a simple solution.  If you are able to modify the html page which is loading the xml using javascript and XmlHttpRequest, you can use a hidden iframe to force the xml to load when the page is refreshed.  For example, somewhere in the html page, add the followingp  precode    ltiframe srcmyfile.xml width0 height0 styledisplaynonegtltiframegt ltresolves xml caching issuesgt codepre  pHope this helps.  It may not be the best solution since it causes another get from the server, but I searched and searched and tried various header setting combinations such as xmlhttp.setRequestHeaderCacheControl, nocache and nothing worked in ie9  ie8 would read the xml from the server if you closed the browser and reopened it.  But ie9 simply will not at least not from my godaddy server.  So with this method, you can simply refresh the page, and the xml will be read from the server every time.  ie9 seems to have really applied caching to the extreme to where its making it difficult to get fresh data.  I use godaddy hosting, Im not sure if that adds further issues  maybe due to proxy servers.p  pHope this helps. Markp

Negative 82877 pSo I have been looking into Single Table Inheritance lately, and have found this common questionanswerp  blockquote   pquestion how do you change the class of an object codeobjcode from Alpha to   Beta, assuming Beta lt Alpha, in STIp      panswer ruby is a ducktyped language, so you dont use casting.  But all you need to do is set the type variable to Beta and save the object, and the next time you load the Alpha object it will be of type Betap  precodeobj  Alpha.new obj.save now obj is of type Alpha  obj.type  Beta obj.save now obj is of type Beta codepre blockquote  pHowever, this approach does not seem to work for me.  While obj does correctly save, it doesnt seem to function as a Beta object at all.  It saves without running Beta validations, and when I checked codeobj.respondtobetamethod betamethod being a method in the beta classcode, it returned false.  Does this approach not work  Is there a correct approach  Or am I simply doing something wrongp  pbEDITbp  pI found that when I did Alpha.last.respondtobetamethod it returned false, while Beta.last.respondtobetamethod returned true both Alpha.last and Beta.last returned the same object however.  Interesting development  Still if someone could explain this in detail with respect to how ruby handles inheritance that would be awesome. p

In essence, the while loop looks like thisp  precodegt data   gt  gt if data  None gt     print Connection Failed else gt     print Connection Established gt  gt while True gt     data  socket.recv1024 codepre  pNow what I want to do is leave this while loop running continually throughout the life of the program until the bluetooth device is switched off which in turn will end the loop as no data will be being received. Nonetheless, as this while loop continues, I then want to move onto another method which will parse the data.p  pHow can I leave the loop running and move on to the next command Is threading required Im new to the concept of threading and so please be patient with me p  pThanksp

Negative 82877 pI am developing a website for a customer who sells antiques. All his communications are mailbased and I developed an inquiry reply template for him.

Negative 82877 pSeeing that my understanding of computer science terminology is lacking, bear with me and correct me if misname a CS concept.p  pIs there a way to do something I would call eminline postassignmentem on variables Its essentially the opposite flow of inline preassignment. For examplep  precode some random number int currentNumber  0   e.g. of inline preassignment assigns 5 to var before entering function doSomethingOnNumbercurrentNumber  5   e.g. of envisioned inline postassignment   assigns 5 to var after entering function doSomethingOnNumber5  currentNumber   And yes, I know I could just do something like doSomethingOnNumbercurrentNumber currentNumber  5   But that is rather boring D codepre  pIt may be a crazy question seeing that the equals sign is just that assigns right hand data to left hand variable, but maybe theres some Java framework that can preform thatp  pThe main way this would be useful would be for something likep  precodeprivate int myNum  0  public int resetNum int newNum      return myNum      myNum  newNum  this never happens because of the return  codepre  pWhile a good design shouldnt need to have something like this, you might have a method specification that requires it both reset a counter and return its value.p

Curious if anyone has run into this, or can tell me what the issue is.p  pThe structure that I send looks like thisp  precodestruct TRMessageHeader    int length   int code   struct TRMessagePushPeer    struct TRMessageHeader header   float force  codepre  pMy code that sends it over the wire looks like thisp  precode void testFloatint floatValue    struct TRMessagePushPeer message  0   message.header.code  TRMessageCodePushPeer   message.header.length  sizeofmessage   message.force  floatValue   NSArray  peers  [session peersWithConnectionStateGKPeerStateConnected]   NSData  data  [NSData dataWithBytesampmessage lengthsizeofmessage]   NSError  error  NULL   [session sendDatadata toPeerspeers withDataModeGKSendDataReliable erroramperror]  codepre  pMy receiving code looks like thisp  precode void onPeerPushedNSNotification  notification    NSDictionary  userInfo  [notification userInfo]   NSData  messageData  [userInfo objectForKeymessageData]   struct TRMessagePushPeer  message  struct TRMessagePushPeer [messageData bytes]   NSLogpeer sent float f,messagegtforce  codepre  pSo the issue Im having is if i call testFloat0.4573, then the receiving peers float value is 0. If I call testFloat1.3458 then the receiving peers float value is 1.p  pSo it seems like its rounding down in the peer receive code but Im not sure why.p  pI figure encoding the float with IEEE754 would work, but I would like to know why this doesnt work as is before I encode it.p
Negative 82877 pI have a system whereby users can upload sometimes large100200 MB files from within an MVC3 application.  I would like to not block the UI while the file is uploading, and after some research, it looked like the new AsyncController might let me do what Im trying to do.  Problem is  every example I have seen isnt really doing the same thing, so I seem to be missing one crucial piece.  After much futzing and fiddling, heres my current codep  precodepublic void CreateAsyncint CompanyId, FormCollection fc              UserProfile up  new UserRepository.GetUserProfileUser.Identity.Name         int companyId  CompanyId          make sure we got a file..         if Request.Files.Count lt 1                      RedirectToActionCreate                   HttpPostedFileBase hpf  Request.Files[0] as HttpPostedFileBase         if hpf.ContentLength gt 0                      AsyncManager.OutstandingOperations.Increment              BackgroundWorker worker  new BackgroundWorker             worker.DoWork  o, e gt                                      string fileName  hpf.FileName                     AsyncManager.Parameters[recipientId]  up.id                     AsyncManager.Parameters[fileName]  fileName                              worker.RunWorkerCompleted  o, e gt  AsyncManager.OutstandingOperations.Decrement              worker.RunWorkerAsync                    RedirectToActionUploading       public void CreateCompletedint recipientId, string fileName              SystemMessage msg  new SystemMessage         msg.IsRead  false         msg.Message  Your file   fileName   has finished uploading.         msg.MessageTypeId  1         msg.RecipientId  recipientId         msg.SendDate  DateTime.Now         SystemMessageRepository.AddMessagemsg           public ActionResult Uploading              return View      codepre  pNow the idea here is to have the user submit the file, call the background process which will do a bunch of things for testing purposes is just pulling the filename for now, while directing them to the Uploading view which simply says your file is uploading...carry on and well notify you when its ready.  The CreateCompleted method is handling that notification by inserting a message into the userss message queue.  p  pSo the problem is, I never get the Uploading view.  Instead I get a blank Create view.  I cant figure out why.  Is it because the CreateCompleted method is getting called which shows the Create view  Why would it do that if its returning void  I just want it to execute silently in the background, insert a message and stop.  p  pSo is this the right approach to take at ALL  my whole reason for doing it is with some network speeds, it can take 30 minutes to upload a file and in its current version, it blocks the entire application until its complete.  Id rather not use something like a popup window if I can avoid it, since that gets into a bunch of support issues with popupblocking scripts, etc.  p  pAnyway  I am out of ideas.  Suggestions  Help  Alternate methods I might considerp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 82877 pI have an asp.net MVC3 application that makes Ajax calls to the server on various occassion.

Negative 82877 pIm testing my Magento store with a bought theme at Princessly.com which I have been testing and customizing since 4 months ago. I have an obsession of testing ALL different  possible pages of a site before launching it. In most cases, the site is simple enough to have about 3  10 different types of pages list page, article page, contact form page, about page, etc. which I would go through one by one to tweak and customize into every minor detail.p  pHowever, Magento based on Zend Framework seems to be very versatile in having all different sorts of pages accessible from a variety of different URLs even for the same content. Understandably, the user experience is much more sophisticated with a eCommerce site than that of a content site, thus having many more types of pages. p  pIn addition to the problem, theme designers may not fully understand Magento. They would usually left many notsocommon pages undesigned with just default styles that would look pretty ugly to users who step on them.p  pMy question is, stronghow can I find a reference  list of ALL possible Magento pages so that I can go through them one by one to make a consistenly good design throughout the entire Magento storestrongp  pThanks a lot It sucks to have obsessive disorders.p

Negative 82877 pi have a website, that is created to be loaded by the webview on android devices so basically what i am expecting is that the website i am going to load will fit on the screen, i.e. there should not be anything overflowing the page and introduce scrollingp  pwhen you load the site in webview in portrait mode, it loads fine, i mean everything is in place, no overflow whatever, image are in its correct size, if i change it to landscape while viewing the webview, everything is still cool, it still scales and displays the same view as it were in portrait mode, u just get that extra space around it.p  phowever, if i load the webview in landscape mode first, it seems the content of my site is enlarged in a way because in landscape, u have that extra width, now if i turn my phone to make it portrait, it is not rescaling my website content, so the picture is too big in the portrait, and it forces you to scroll to the right to see the entire picture.p  pi am trying to avoid where you need to scroll to see the contentp  pis it because when rotating webview, say from landscape to portrait, android just take whatever is in landscape mode and put it in portrait, without trying to resize itp

Could someone explain why the notify doesnt notify the wait Thanksp  pNote the rest of the code works im only interested in these two specific parts.p  precodeimport com.fmr.ipgt.email. import java.io.File import java.io.IOException import java.util.List import org.jdom.Document import org.jdom.Element import org.jdom.JDOMException import org.jdom.input.SAXBuilder import javax.mail.MessagingException  class MyQuery  synchronized void qQuery throws Exception      String query  .z.k  The query that is used to query q this can be changed here.     int version  0     c qConn  null     qConn  new cMain.host,Main.port  Connect to the q database       while Main.healthy            Object o  qConn.kquery  Query q           version  c.to           ifversion0                System.out.printlnversion               System.out.printlndatabase healthy               NewThread.suspendFlag  false               notify                break  End the process if the database responds                               System.out.printlnreaches loop end      class MyThread implements Runnable    MyQuery myResource    MyThreadString name, MyQuery so      myResource  so     new Threadthis, name.start       public void run       try        myResource.qQuery  Begin a method to query q.      catch Exception e        e.printStackTrace           class NewThread implements Runnable         String name  name of thread        Thread t        static boolean suspendFlag     private int minutes        NewThreadint minutes             this.minutes  minutes            System.out.printlnreaches constructor           t  new Threadthis           suspendFlag  true           t.start  Start the thread                 This is the entry point for thread.        public void run            try               synchronizedthis                  whilesuspendFlag                      System.out.printlnreaches wait                    waitminutes60000                     System.out.printlnreaches end                    ifsuspendFlag                         Main.setHealthfalse                     Main.sendMessages  The database has not responded for the given time.

Negative 82877 pIm using a custom BasicComboBoxRenderer for a JComboBox and Ive changed the appearance of the items of the dropdown list. However these changes also apply to the single top item that shows in the combobox dont know how to call it.p  pI want the top item to be independent of the other items in the list, if possible. I would also like to get rid of the top items blue color when it is focused setFocusablefalse is not what I want.p  pIve tried to use the renderer index 1 to affect the top item but it doesnt seem to help.p  pAny ideasp  pP.S Unfortunately I couldnt add images to be more clear no reputation.p  pEDIT When I say that I want the top item to be independent from all the other items of the dropdown list I mean to always look different from the rest of them. For example in my custom BasicComboBoxRenderer Ive set the selected item to have a different background, but this background also applies to the top item since the selected item becomes the top item of the combobox.p  pEDIT 2 top item  I meant the combobox display area, so I want to affect the item that is shown at the display area and not the first item in the dropdown list. I managed to do this by using setBackground on the combobox itself AND setFocusablefalse which is not very helpful because I want to keep the focus mechanism. But the problem is except the focus issue that if for example I set a border on each item in the list through a custom BasicComboBoxRenderer or ListCellRenderer class, this same border appears on the item that is shown in the display area. So there are 2 questions herep  pIs there any way to differentiate the layout of the items in the dropdown list and the single item in the display areap  pIs there any way to disable the focus color of the combobox without disabling the focus mechanism, just like when we use setFocusPaintedfalse on buttons Ive also tried to add a custom FocusListener on the combobox but any change made of the background through focusGained affects only the button and not the item shown in the display area.p  pSorry for the confusion and the multiple edits...p
Negative 82877 pI am building an iOS application.

But I can replicate the error on two different devices exactly, so its not the memory itself which is bad.p  pIm not expecting a complete answer, but some pointers to where I should start looking would be very nice  thank youp  pEDIT I removed the c lib completely, but the error still persists. I will update once I have gotten closer.p  pEDIT The problem was in the Cocos2d v. 2 display stats adding and removing pointers.

Negative 82877 pOK, I have a question Im too confused to ask properly but heres a gop  pSomewhere in the android documentation it statesp  pemNote Eclipse sometimes likes to add an import android.R statement at the top of your files that use resources, especially when you ask eclipse to sort or otherwise manage imports. This will cause your make to break. Look out for these erroneous import statements and delete them.emp  pIve noticed this behavior before.  The first time was a very bad experience because I couldnt understand what was going on.  Anyway since then whenever I notice import android.R I just delete it.p  pMy most recent project used the latest SDK including the Master  Detail Activity wizard that creates fragments.  I noticed in my ListFragment source file import android.R and then deleted it which broke it because it apparently needs android.R to use the built in layout simplelistitemactivated1 httpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidR.layout.htmlsimplelistitemactivated1 in onCreate.p  precodeOverride public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setListAdapternew ArrayAdapterltDummyContent.DummyItemgtgetActivity,             R.layout.simplelistitemactivated1,             R.id.text1,             DummyContent.ITEMS  codepre  pSo I add it back and its fine.  The problem is with android.R included I cant see any of my defined XML stuff.  In my case Im trying to use a menu I created in onCreateOptionsMenu.p  precodeOverride public void onCreateOptionsMenuMenu menu, MenuInflater inflater      super.onCreateOptionsMenumenu, inflater     MenuInflater inflater  getMenuInflater     inflater.inflateR.menu.menuchecklistlist, menu     R.layout.  codepre  pSo my problem is if I dont import android.R then onCreate is broke if I do import android.R then onCreateOptionsMenu is broke.  Damned if I do, damned if I dont.  emcriesemp  pp

Negative 82877 pI am most of the way through migrating a Drupal 5 site through Drupal 6 to Drupal 7. The CCK Content Migrate did a great job with one exception all fields in select list format have one of several issues with the keylabel pairs in their allowed values list.p  pIf the original allowed valued list did not use keylabel pairs, like thisp  precodeAlabama Alaska Arizona  codepre  pThe allowed values were automatically updated to keylabel format when they were migrated to Drupal 7, like thisp  precode1Alabama 2Alaska 3Arizona codepre  pThis wouldnt be so bad, except that the actual data in the database did not change accordingly, so you would see Alabama instead of 1 for existing data. Presumably, any new data would store 1 instead Alabama. Also, when editing a node, the value None is preselected in the select list despite the fact that data exists for that field. p  pIn some cases the allowed valued list did use keylabel pairs with a string as the key, like thisp  precodemovieMovie televisionTelevision productorserviceProduct or Service codepre  pIn these cases, the key is stored in the database. As in the previous case, the value None is preselected when editing a node instead of showing the existing data. The keylabel pairs were not changed when migrating to Drupal 7, although I noticed that spaces were removed, for examplep  precodeproductorservice  Product or Service codepre  pbecamep  precodeproductorserviceProduct or Service codepre  pBut the issue here is that the key is displayed in the node like productorservice  instead of the label like Product or Service.p  pIn all cases, exposed filters created from these select lists in Views return no results. I tried creating exposed filters with other fields that were not select lists like text fields and those worked just fine once use AJAX was selected in that Views Advanced Options.  p  pSo the question is whats the best way to move forward with these fields Id like to make consistent use of keylabel data for both existing and new nodes. And I would love to avoid backtracking to Drupal 6 to start the migration process over again if at all possiblep  pI have only found two references to this issue online.

Negative 82877 pIm writing some wrapping code, where an external library calls a c function using variadic templates and such. The crucial point is that the external library requires a cfunction, which would normally be fine, as this is legalp  precodeLibraryFuncType fn  []params  ...  codepre  pWhile I can easily do this by hand, I would like to automate the wrapping with something likep  precodefunctioncontext, name, myfunc codepre  pTo do this, I would need a function similar top  precodetemplate ltReturnType, ParamTypes...gt static void functionContext ampctx, const stdstring ampname, stdfunctionltReturnTypeParamTypes...gt fn      ctx.registerFunctionname, [fn]State state gt int          Context ctxstate         return applyhelperltsizeof..ParamTypesgtapplyctx, fn       codepre  pwhere the second parameter ctx.registerFunction is of the type LibraryFuncType. p  pBut this of course is problematic, because the lambda conversion is no longer legal due to the capture of fn. However, if I dont capture fn, then I wont have access to it in the lambda.p  pI think the only way to deal with this is to have a static variable, but its not clear to me the best way to introduce it. The current solution I have isp  precodetemplate lttypename ReturnType, typename... ParamTypesgt struct functionhelper    static stdfunctionltReturnTypeParamTypes...gt fn    functionhelperstdfunctionltReturnTypeParamTypes...gt fn        fn  fn       static void registerFnContext ampctx, const stdstring ampname        ctx.registerFnname, []state state gt int            Context ctxstate           return applyhelperltsizeof...ltParamTypesgtgtapplyctx, fn             template lttypename ReturnType, typename... ParamTypesgt stdfunctionltReturnTypeParamTypes...gt functionhelperltReturnType, ParamTypes...gtfn  template lttypename ReturnType, typename... ParamTypesgt void functionContext ampctx, const stdstring ampname, stdfunctionltReturnTypeParamTypes...gt fn    functionhelperltReturnType, ParamTypes...gt regfn   reg.registerFnctx, name  codepre  pWhile technically this works, its clearly dangerous and hacky, because if I use functionhelper on two functions with the same signature, it will set fn incorrectly for one of them.p  pAdditionally, I could do the same dangerousstatic variable by just declaring a static variable in function. I made the class hoping it would lead to some insight into a correct way of getting around the problem.p  pDoes anyone know of a better way of using a lambda that doesnt require a capture or alternatively, a way of converting a lambda that does capture to a cfunctionp

Negative 82877 pA pure function in functional programming is the one which do not have side effects. One of the meanings of this is it can not change the values of input parameters. Can this be seen as disadvantage for the memory utilization br e.g. Lets say I have a function which simply takes a list and add another element in it. In C it could be as simple as brp  pre code void addElemstdvector vec, int a      vec.inserta  code pre  pThis function clearly doesnt use much memory than already taken by passed object.br But same in Haskell will come to something like this. brp  pre addElem  [Int]  Int  [Int]  addElem xs a  xs  [a] pre  pNow in this computation as xs is not changing its value. So am I correct in saying that at some time the function will be consuming the memory double size of  xs, one for xs and other for the return value. Or somehow lazy invocation makes sure that actually xs is only getting returned by adding only one element at the end br I know that Monad is the way to have something which can have side effect. But can Monad be used to simply modify the input and return its valuebr Also can changing xs  [a] to axs consumes less memory p

Negative 82877 pIve currently got a reasonably large site up that ive been asked to make changes to.  Currently To login to this site you need to go to www.example.comfolderloginpage.html This site is only accessible internally at this time and it is unlikely to ever be accessible externally. We would like to, however, be able to direct external users to a subdirectory on the site a survey form which is located in www.example.comfoldersubfoldersurvey.html  This survey writes its results back to the main application and i believe they are integrated tightly. p  pWe initially tried the idea of using an additional IIS7 box as a reverse proxy however it is quite confusing to me, im not very familiar with IISARR and the other features required im mostly familiar with networking. I did try and follow a number of tutorials but didnt get very far. Id like to avoid it if possible.p  pHow can I, using IIS7 this site is in ASP.NET restrict external users from accessing anything other than the survey pages there are a few included files necessary as well Is it possible to make www.example.comfoldersubfoldersurvey.html a website initself so that i can publish a URL like survey.example.com externally p  pIve come across other examples where access is restricted from specific pages but the root of the site is still accessible  ie www.eg.com is allowed but www.eg.comadmin.aspx is denied. Id like to the the reverse in effect, and if possible, hide the true url.p  pHope someone can help If using a reverse proxy is possible im happy to do it but id need detailed instructions. p  pThanks for reading, Much appreciatedp  pEdit Sorry all, Im new to stackoverflow, indeed Ive just realised that there are several other subcommunities.

I have tried to decipher the implementations of all the related libstdc functions such as stdasync, stdfuture, stdthread etc but with no luck.p  pThe following code is the implementation of both the not working version and the working one.

Negative 82877 pI am developing an iOS application from which users can post various kinds of events in a server and view the events created from all the users. The question i have , does not have a programming nature. I would like to show here , how i would design my servers database and tell me your opinion about it and how i could improve it.p  pThe application has a very simple interface where the user when he wants to post an event , simply writes a title , some comments and attaches a photo if he wants . Then this information is sent through XML to my server and stored to the database. p  pThe problem is that because some people are immature , they would try to post inappropriate words or even photos. So i would like to have some control on my users. What i am thinking is , at the first time that the application runs on the mobile phone and connects to the server , the server would send a user id back to the phone. Then every time the users sends an xml file , he attaches his user id with the xml programatically attached. Also i would keep another database with all the user ids that have been created over time. So if i notice an inappropriate event , i could delete the user id from my database , and the next time the user tries to send something, the server would understand that this id is not in the database and so not allow the posting. Of course if someone decides to uninstall and reinstall the application and get a new user id , he could again post but thats ok with me.p  pWould it be an easier way to prevent immature behaviors or this one sounds okp

Negative 82877 pThis is a subset of the problem I am trying to tackle. Assume that I have parsed some code and now I am trying to check if it is logically correct.

Negative 82877 pI am using wordpress, and I am creating a widget chooser for every page of the site. On the backend of each page, I have 15 checkboxes  if the user chooses a checkbox, it shows that particular widget in the sidebar of that page.p  pI have a large PHP document, with 15 includes. Each include is a widget. If the user checks a box on that page, that include is triggered like sop  precode if inarray Blog, getfieldmodules         include modulesblog.php    codepre  pThis works great But, there is no way for the user to specify the order in which the widgets will appear.

Negative 82877 pI am trying to learn a little about socket programming and I have stumbled across TcpListener and TcpClient to use as I read they are slightly easier for beginners. The basic jist of what I want to accomplish is to have a small form that can be run on my laptop and another laptop on the same network and for them to be able to communicate i.e. send a string of text to each other. Once I have this I will hopefully develop it further p  pSo far I have created both a Client and a Server program using msdn and various guides found on the internet. I can get them to communicate when both running on one laptop however when I move the client to another laptop I get nowhere. I think my main issue is I do not understand quite how the client finds the Servers IP as I think I could hard code it but when I come back at another time Im sure the IP will have changed. Is there any way to get the two to connect in a more dynamic way to encompass the changing IP My current Client codep  precode    public void msgstring mesg              lstProgress.Items.Addgtgt   mesg           private void btnConnectClickobject sender, EventArgs e              string message  Test         try                       Create a TcpClient.

Negative 82877 pI am building an application with jquery, php, jquerymobile on a WAMP server. Everything in the app works fine until I try to go back to another page and where it should fire a function based on the codepageinitcode function. It doesnt seem to fire therefore the page is blank and no json data is put into the page. When I checked the events with firebug I realised in the console that the page gets a 304 Not Modified error which I read has to do with cacheing. How can I stop this from happening also within my ajax request the cache value is set to false.p

So, as if the face move to the left, the camera would turn left to follow it, etc.p  pDo you know if OpenCVSharp C wrapper can do thisp  pLets make it simpler let say I want to detect and track the head not eyes so let take the center of the head as the target and try to make it become in the center of the camera picture as much as possible.

Negative 82877 pLet me explain my problem. I am using Lucene to search and display the results in asp.net web page. When I am searching, the Lucene is displaying all the records associated with my search. For Example I have 5000 records with name John. If I type John it is displaying all this 5000 records. I want to restrict this 5000 records based on some other attribute. I have four attributes namely First Name, Last Name, DOB and ID. Out those 5000 records I want it to display only the ones with the inputted DOB by the user. This means just display the records of john who have DOB as 5121998. This will restrict the result to around 50 records. Once I am done with that I want to search all the fields who have same ID and then display those records. In the end I will have records of John with given DOB and same ID. p  pNote Filtering by DOB is for security purpose. p  pThe following is my Code for search. p  precode        ListltSearchResultsgt Searchresults  new ListltSearchResultsgt           string indexFileLocation  Co         Lucene.Net.Store.Directory dir      Lucene.Net.Store.FSDirectory.GetDirectoryindexFileLocation          string[] searchfields  new string[]  fname, lname, dob, id         IndexSearcher indexSearcher  new IndexSearcherdir          var hits  indexSearcher.SearchQueryMakersearchString, searchfields          for int i  0 i lt hits.Length i                      SearchResults result  new SearchResults             result.fname  hits.Doci.GetFieldfname.StringValue             result.lname  hits.Doci.GetFieldlname.StringValue             result.dob  hits.Doci.GetFielddob.StringValue             result.id  hits.Doci.GetFieldid.StringValue             Searchresults.Addresult           codepre  pPlease let me know if you have any questions.p

Negative 82877 pIm new to laravel 4 and trying to figure out the best way to structure the files in my publichtml directory.p  pRight now i have to go to www.mydomian.compublicroute to get anything to work. Not sure if this is correct or not. I supposed i could create a route to make that the default, but im just looking for best practices. Is that how you do it, or is there a better wayp  pShould only the public directory be in the publichtml file or should i have all of the unzipped files from laravel 4 in its own folderp  pThanksp

Negative 82877 pIm developing two applications.  One is a windows store app that will run on WinRT and one is a WPF application that will either run on Windows 7 or 8.  p  pThe two applications are supposed to communicate through an SSL connection Tcp.  I would like to have a common class created that will be used by both applications So that changes to the class will affect both projects.p  pIve tried using a portable class library, however, it doesnt support any SSL or even TCP connections There is no System.Net.Sockets namespace.  This is probably because windows store apps use StreamSocket instead of SslStream or TcpClient and WPF applications dont have StreamSocket.  p  pIs there anything in common that will help me develop this class  Is there perhaps any way that I can use SslStreamTcpClient in a windows store app or StreamSocket in a WPF application  Having two different classes for the same functionality is very bad design.p

Negative 82877 pI am working on a registration page of my Asp.Net website. When we use Server side Asp.net builtin validation controls, they work both on client side by generating appropriate java script code and offer server side protection too. So if somebody circumvent that java script, still the page has to be validated on the server. Currently i am using my own asp.net C functions in Custom Validators to do the job but these only works on server side. I mean the equal java script is not automatically generated on my web form. Is it the default behavior of Asp.Net or am i missing anything Do I have to write my client side java script on myself when i use asp.net custom validatorsp  pMy 2nd question is when we write function for our asp.net custom validator. They are called when the page is submitted to server. can i access such function with java script, so that the will start working before the page is submitted to the server.p

Negative 82877 pI have code that I want to use to log error messages.

But how can I add the details that I need to addp  precodecatch DbEntityValidationException ex      var msg  new HttpStatusErrors     msg.Header  Validation Error      foreach var eve in ex.EntityValidationErrors              var header  string.FormatEntity of type 0 in state 1 has the following validation errors,             eve.Entry.Entity.GetType.Name, eve.Entry.State         foreach var ve in eve.ValidationErrors                      var detail  string.Format Property 0, Error 1,                 ve.PropertyName, ve.ErrorMessage                 . codepre

Negative 82877 pI work on a team that uses TFS for source control.

Negative 82877 pI have a bunch of coded numbers that represent each county in the United States.  Each countys code is unique, and is made up of a twodigit state code and a three digit odd number based on a county.  p  pFor example, in my SQL database, Texas is code 42. Dallas County, Texas is 42113 Dawson County, Texas is 42115.  p  pI am trying to match these codes with another DB table that contains similar codes but with differing state codes.  In this DB, Texas is code 45, so Dallas County is 45113.

If the value of the string state is WV, I want to change the 47 in 47strong to 12strong.p  pFor some reason I just cant wrap my mind around a way to do this efficiently.  Any ideasp

All the views are currently singletons, and I use Castle Windsor for IoC.p  pBearing in mind that INavigationAware methods dont get called on viewmodels in nested regions, whats a good approach for initialisation and cleanup of my child views Is it an acceptable design for the parent VM to hold references injected to the child VM I could then call some kind of initcleanup methods on the child VMs from within the parents codeOnNavigatedToFromcode methodp  pAnother option might be to change the views to transient, then I could simply use the constructor for initialisation, and not worry about cleanup which I only do to clear down old state before the view is reused and displayed. The only potential issue is that my application uses an event service similar to Prisms event broker, with some viewmodels acting as publishers and others as subscribers. Im concerned that if I made them transient, the viewmodels wont get GCd because of the event subscription, and these dead views would continue responding to events. Is this correct If so, do I presumably need to implement a way of cleaning up as above, where I can unsubscribep

Negative 82877 pRecently Ive been reading through Linux usbserial.c and generic.c, finding that the probe method of struct usbdriver is invoked when usb core detects a new device plugged.  However I couldnt find where the probe method of struct usbserialdriver is called, seems that this method is used for some tty related setups. Actually, the template driver generic.c didnt implement this probe method.p

I would like to change the color of my product whenever users are over the master span elements.p  pIn order to be more accurate here is the html code p  precodeltspan classwrapperproductboxgt lta hrefP1.html title classproductimagegtltimg srcP1.jpg width210 height210 altgtltagt ltdiv classcategoryProductBoxgt     ltdiv classproductnamegt         lta hrefP1.html titlePRODUCT NAMEgtPRODUCT NAMEltagt     ltdivgt ltdivgtltspangt codepre  pSo to sum up I would like to know if there is a way in CSS to change the font color of the productname a element whenever users mouse over the master wrapperproductbox element  or the productimage a element.p  pThank you very much for your help p

Negative 82877 pI have generated a polar plot in R using ggplot2 and would like to find a way to clearup the plot in two aspects.

During testing, this problem never arose because the images were already cached by my browser so no excessive loading time was needed.p  pHere is the JavaScript jQuery I use for the slideshow. The images originally come from a serverside database so I use AJAX to get the file name values I need currently there are only 14 entriespictures in the database, but this number could increase or decrease as site admins will be able to edit the pictures in the slideshow through a partial CMS.

Negative 82877 pI have a dynamic form that you can add elements. Like, you type a name, and then if you have to write a new name, you click on Add Name, and another textbox appears. p  pTheir names are codenames[]code. I can process those inputs with PHP on the serverside. However, I want to make a calculation with those inputs, like writing all of them on the page as the user types. p  pHowever, because those inputs, those textboxes are created dynamically, Javascript only selects the first textbox with the name codename[]code. p  pLet me make it clear. This way itll be better. I got a textbox. I input age in there. If I want to enter a new age, I click Add Age button, and a new input box pops out. I write the new age value. And as I type, on a 3rd textbox, the average of those age values get printed. But because of those input boxes, with names codeages[]code are created on the execution time not the compile time, Im not sure these are the appropriate words for those. Probably not, because nothing is compiling  or is it, I cant process them. p  pWhat must I do to solve this problem p  pI used both p  precodeinput[nameages[]].changefunction   console.log1  codepre  pand p  precodeinput[nameages[]].oninput, function   console.log2  codepre  pbut it didnt work. p  pThanks in advance. p
Negative 82877 pI have a server control one which creates a dll file which is later referenced by the websites to use the control. Previously, for ajax requests the service was directly called from javascript exposing the actual service path which is a very big issue.

Negative 82877 pWhat is the popular approach to managing build tasks when using Maven Im currently using Maven for dependency management, but I need to define several tasks that can be executed anytime independent of the lifecycle similar to what Ant or Rake provides just a simple function that executes a sequence of steps whenever its called by name.p  pFor example, one task would be to take a codejarcode file from a userprovided folder, install it in a local Maven repository associated with one of my maven modules using the codemvn installinstallfile DlocalRepositoryPathrepocode command, and change that modules pom.xml to point to the new version of the jar. This task has nothing to do with the lifecycle, its just a general task to do some specific thing so I dont have to do it manually, executed any time I want by typing e.g. codemvn taskupdatejarcode.p  pAnother example would be a task that deletes the contents of a directory inside one of my maven modules and then copies contents from a userprovided directory into the emptied directory. Again, this task has nothing to do with Maven or dependencies, but its nice not to do it manually all the time.p  pHow do people write these tasks  it must be a common problem I know maven provides the codeantruncode plugin, but as far as I know it can only bind to Maven lifecycle phases which isnt what I want. I could use Ant besides maven with a build.xml file, but thats silly if Maven somehow can be configured to do what I want by itself. Also, requiring BOTH Maven and Ant to manage my project seems less than optimal.p

Negative 82877 pHaving all kinds of problems getting Sails to work with RequireJS, mainly because I cant find any definitive source on the best way to do this.  There are several posts out there that discuss this, but they are older and all do things differently.  Would really love to see the Creators enlighten the community on the proper way to do this given the changes to the Sails application structure, linker process etc. in the latter versions .0.9.9, ,0.10 p  pSo, first question would be...if I am planning on using an AMDRequireJS  Backbone approach for my clientside code, and want to use the R.js Optimizer in grunt to build my production JS file and resolve all the nested dependencies automatically rather than have to list them out manually, should I not create the application with the linker option and manually manage the grunt build process myselfp  pAlso, where in the directory structure should the vendor directory be placed that contains all the dependent JS libs like Underscore, jQuery, Backbone etc. reside  p

Negative 82877 pBeginning with Haskell and stuck at the State Monad ...p  pSo I am trying to come to grips with the State Monad in Haskell, and to understand it, I am writing a code to generate PRBS sequences. For people interested, it is described in the paper Pseudo Random Sequences and Arrays, a free copy of which can be obtained by the doi 10.1109PROC.1976.10411. p  pThe essential coputation is very simple. You have a emshift registerem and a emgenerator polynomialem. The generator polynomial tells you which bits of the shift register to take and sum modulo 2 to get the MSB of the shift register. In the next iteration, you take this computed MSB and stick it to the MSB of the shift register emafterem doing a right shift operation. p  pThe code for doing this without monads is really simplep  precodeimport Data.List  m  4Int               This is the degree of the polynomial p  tail  [4, 1, 0]       This is a actual polynomial s  1  replicate m1 0  This is the initial state. Note that the head is the MSB  chSt poly s  msb poly s  init s  changes the shift register s     where         msb poly s  let tot  sum  map  reverse s   poly                      in  tot mod 2  word p s  take n  bits p s     where         bits p s  last s  bits p chSt p s         n         2  length s  1 codepre  pThe output is as follows p  precode[ghci] word p s      gt [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1] codepre  pwhich is what I want.p  pNow of course, since the shift register can be considered to be a emstateem which we modify, we can use the state monad for this purpose. Maybe it is too simple a problem to learb about the state monad, bit I just seem to think that this might be the perfect example which one may implement using the state monad. So here is what I did p  precodegetVal  [Int] gt State [Int] Int getVal poly  do     curState lt get     let lsb  last curState     modify  chSt poly     return lsb  bitM  State [Int] Int  bitM  getVal p codepre  pThis is just adding on to the previous code segment of code, along with the codeimport Control.Monad.Statecode in the first like of the program. When I import this into GHCI and check the state computations, I am able to get individual values as shown belowp  precode[ghci] runState  bitM   s                                   gt 0,[0,1,0,0] [ghci] runState  bitM gtgt bitM   s                           gt 0,[0,0,1,0] [ghci] runState  bitM gtgt bitM gtgt bitM  s                    gt 0,[1,0,0,1] [ghci] runState  bitM gtgt bitM gtgt bitM gtgt bitM s             gt 1,[1,1,0,0] [ghci] runState  bitM gtgt bitM gtgt bitM gtgt bitM gtgt bitM s     gt 0,[0,1,1,0] [ghci]  codepre  pSo both the state is being updated correctly and the value being returned is also correct. Now I want to create a function like the function codewordcode in the previous implementation that will apply the codegtgtcode operator on the codebitMcodes codencode times so that we can create the array codeword p scode. I am totally clueless about how to even go about doing this. Note, that I dont want to put in a set of functions like p  precodef1  bitM f2  bitM gtgt bitM f3  bitM gtgt bitM gtgt bitM  ... codepre  pI want one function to which I will pass codencode and it will do the codebitMcode evaluations successively codencode times, passing on the state internally in successive computations automatically, collect the resultant values, and create an array as a result. How do I go about doing that I cant figure out how to go about doing this. Any help will be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 82877 pI have a shared library that tries to provide a standardized interface, basically a list of functions. Some of these functions are already provided by another shared library. So I could just write the additional functions and ask the user to link to both libraries, i.e. have him do thisp  precodeg foo.c lmine lother codepre  pIn order to make things easier for the user, however, I dont want to do that. Given the situation Im in, this would be way more complicated than just adding a flag in some script. I want the user to link only against my library and get the functions from the other library as well.p  pIn Windows, I could use DLL forwarders and simply list the functions I want reexported. In MacOS, I could use the codereexportlibrarycode linker option to make my library pretend to include the other one. If I didnt mind creating a full copy of the other library and had a static version, I could use the codewholearchivecode on that to pull it into my library wholesale.p  pBut is there any way in Linux to give the export table of my library an entry that says this function is in that other library over therep  pOr alternatively, is there anything I can do to my library that makes it so that when it is given to the linker, the linker will say, oh, I need to pull in that other library too The documentation of the coderpathlinkcode options suggests that this should just work, but it doesnt. libtool does this, of course, but libtool isnt an option.p  pWhat I could of course do is just fill my library with tiny stubs for these functions, but Id rather not. That would be quite annoying what with having to do renaming in just the correct order so that the linker picks up the right version at the right time. But if theres really no other way, any help on proceeding with that would be appreciated too.p

Negative 82877 pI have inherited a C program that used to automate the creation of a daily report on Windows XP Pro SP3 using PDFCreator 1.2.3, MapInfo Professional 11, Word 2003, and Excel 2003.  This Win XP machine was in an Active Directory domain and the C program ran as a domain user with Administrative permissions with the user logged in and the desktop locked.  Word 2003 was automated to open a template, create a document from the template, and save the documentall fromon a network share.  Excel 2003 was used to open a spreadsheet with a table linked to an ODBC datasource and refresh the table, pulling the new data into the spreadsheet.  MapInfo was used to generate map images from an ODBC datasource.  PDFCreator was used to take the spreadsheet, word document, and images and put them all together into a daily report.  p  pAs XP has reached its endoflife I have moved this program to a Win 8.1 EE virtual machine in the same domain and have installed Office 365 products Word 2013 and Excel 2013 along with PDFCreator 1.7.1 and MapInfo Professional 12 to use in automating the creation of this daily report.  This program works normally when run manually on the new VM, but fails when run as the same user as a Scheduled Task.  This scheduled task is set to run with the highest permissions and run if the user is not logged in.p  pI realize there are many variables at play here the OS had to change and we dont use the old version of Office anymore, I also couldnt get older versions of PDFCreator or MapInfo.  Therefore, I will focus the question on the things I can control.  I am aware of a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb257757 relnofollowthe problemsa I face in doing this but am not clear on whether or not this is actually possible to do now given the new OS and applications namely Word 2013 and Excel 2013 that I have been asked to try to make it work with.p  pSo, the question is How can Word 2013 be automated from a C InteropCOM program using Task Scheduler to run the program with a user logged on and the desktop lockedp

The first programs worked perfectly, but in a program Im getting an error which seems to be a Windows error instead of a Python one. p  pThis is the program in page 339p  precodefrom socket import  from time import ctime from threading import Thread  class ClientHandlerThread     Handles a client request.     def initself, client         Thread.initself         self.client  client      def runself         self.client.sendbytesctime  nHave a nice day , ascii         self.client.close  HOST  localhost PORT  5000 BUFSIZE  1024 ADDRESS  HOST, PORT  server  socketAFINET, SOCKSTREAM server.bindADDRESS server.listen5   The server now just waits for connections from clients  and hands sockets off to client handlers while True     printWaiting for connection     client, address  server.accept     print...connected from, address     handler  ClientHandlerclient     handler.start codepre  pWhen I run this program, it displays the Waiting for connection message in the Shell. However, when I try to connect to the program using the Command Prompt, it displays the following errorp  precodeCPython33gtpython multiclientserver.py Traceback most recent call last   File multiclientserver.py, line 30, in ltmodulegt     server.bindADDRESS OSError [WinError 10048] Only one usage of each socket address protocolnetwor k addressport is normally permitted codepre  pWe havent studied this in class a lot. So Im just wondering why this happens and how to fix it.p  pThanksp
Negative 82877 pIve created a custom control that displays a color spectrum. Im overriding the OnRender method to draw the control with the colors. For some reason the colors that are calculated the R G B values have some transparency, even though Im setting the Alpha value A in the max possible value 255. Ive created a test window that shows some text on the background and, my control and a Border with a LinearGradient background and the text can be seen behind my control but not behind the Border, which clearly shows that my control has some transparency set.  Any ideas why my calculated colors have transparency even though Im setting A255 I appreciate any suggestions.

Negative 82877 pSo Im using Play as my MVC framework. My web application simply does calls to a Postgres database to feed data to the views. Im currently using AJAX in the view to get the data. I figured there are times when the database will lag a bit in sending the data so I would use AJAX to allow other elements in the view to load.p  pNow my question is, since Im already using AJAX in the view, should I be using Promises in the controllers Would it make a difference if I used Promises I havent had enough experience to figure out how having asynchronous actions both in the view and in the controller can affect my web application. My intuition says that the AJAX action is enough for a web application with about 100  150 hits a day.p  pWhat are your insights on thisp

Negative 82877 pI have created a JIRA gadget. When I put only one instance of it on a dashboard, its fine. When I put a second instance on the same dashboard, configure it to load different data, and then refresh the whole dashboard, I can see that they share most data  as if they get their data from the server at almost the same time and then write to the same javascript variable and then render based on that variable. p  pWhen they render, theyre mostly identical to each other when I know they should be totally different I can see values that match instance As configuration appearing in instance B.p  pAnother way I can tell its wrong is when I refresh each gadget separately, they display the correct data. But when I refresh the entire dashboard, they display mostly the same thing.p  pHow do I keep these separate One thought I had was to try the followingp  ol liKeep a threadsafe request counter on the server.li liFor each request, increment the counter and append the new value to the names of javascript variables in the velocity template.li liWhen adding items to the context hash map, append the request counter to the keys so they match the javascript variables in step 2li liThe renderer takes the modified velocity template and the context hash map and produces something that refers to only its own request results.li ol  pBut Im having some trouble with step 2. I have the location of the template file templatesgadgetsmygadget.vm  its not a real location in that there is no such file on the server at that path. The renderer expects the location as an argument.

But templatesgadgetsmygadget.vm is not an ordinary file path.

Negative 82877 pI am currently working on a C dll, which returns a string to the caller.

However, I also dont see any negative impact in using the second method, which eliminates the need for the caller to allocate memory in beforehand. The only drawback would be that the responsibility of freeing the assigned memory now lies in the hands of the caller. Thanks for your suggestions.p

Negative 82877 pIve seen a few questions and some very helpful answers about how to either downsize and image without losing quality or zoom and image smoothly.p  pMy particular challenge is that I need to do both.  The canvas is to hold an illustrated map with several points plotted over top of it.  When clicking on one of the points, the map needs to zoom in on that point.  On click again, the map needs to zoom back out.p  pI have all the zooming functions working, as well as the plotting of the points and that stuff.  My problem is that I can only optimize for image quality when the map is either zoomed in currently using a 2x image for the 2x zoom or when it is zoomed out use an image the size of the canvas itself.  p  pWhen using the large image, the default zoomed out state of the map looks blurry and is poor.  When zooming in on the large image, it looks great the client even said so.  When using the small image, the default zoomed out state looks great, but the map gets pixelated when zooming in.p  pShort of creating 2 separate image elements one large and one small and changing the opacity of each one at the end of the tween, Im not sure what to do.p  pIve tried using an intermediate sized canvas as the Kinetic.Image source, but that muddies the waters on both ends. Ive also tried adjusting the zoom level scale amount but that makes the new center point calculation crazy.p

The code inside my controller action is running fine. After I get the original 502 error, the controller continues to process the input data and then write the output files. Everything works fine and the only problem Im having is getting a 502 page while I am waiting for it to process and load the next view. Does a controller have a certain amount of time to return a view and if it doesnt is this why Im getting the 502 errorp  pEDIT Im pretty sure what Im experiencing is a timeout error because my controller method takes too long to run. I probably cant speed up the controller method so Im not sure what I can do. I dont think I can or should change timeout settings on the server so maybe there something using ajax that can be done like sending a status update to the browser after every so often. Im totally new to this so Ill have to do some research.p

Negative 82877 pIm familiar with the principle for example, from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21013430defaultcopyconstructorandassignmentforclasswithmoveconstructorandassithis answera  and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19044843gccc11deletingcopyassignmentformoveassignableclassescrashesstdsortthis onea that when a class has a move constructor andor move assignment operator, its default copy constructor and copy assignment operator are deleted. However, In the examples Ive seen, this can be addressed by explicitly defining a new copy constructor and assignment operator.p  pIn my particular case, I have a class which is derived by joint inheritance from a Cstyle struct and a template class. The copy and move assignment operators are explicitly defined in the template, whilst the copy and move constructors are explicitly defined in the class itself. In other words, everything is defined explicitly, emthough not all in the same placeem.

What could be an alternate secure mechanism to keep track of the running score while a quiz is being takenli liThe other one is probably a bigger concern.

Negative 82877 h1Situationh1  pI have a muliple choice mode ListView with two view types normal and header. I load the data from the contacts app by retrieving a cursor with the names and emails and make use of the AlphabetIndexer class. My adapter extends the SimpleCursorAdapter class and implements the SectionIndexer. Moreover I override the getCount method of my adapter so that it returns the count of the cursor  the count of the sections. In addition, my layouts are correct and items highlight in the onListItemClickListener, according to the user actions. p  h1Problemh1  pHowever, I want to highlight all the items with a Check All Button but the code fails to do that. p  precodefor int i  0 i lt adapter.getCount  1 i              adapter.getItemi             if adapter.getItemViewTypei  InviteContactListAdapter.TYPENORMAL                  listView.setItemCheckedi, true                        codepre  pIt changes correctly the layout of the items with position smaller than the cursror.getCount and then refuses to mark the rest with a bigger index.I log the ListView.getCheckedItemPositions and this list includes all the items, including the ones whose layout has not been checked.p  precodeLog.dcheckedItems, listView.getCheckedItemPositions codepre  pSo their state is changed but not their layout.  p  h1Exampleh1  pI have a list with 55 contacts and 20 section headers.

Negative 82877 pId like to write a Linq query SQL backend that constrains rows by a collection of values from several columns.  To illustrate, a naive SQL query might look like this, if I knew all the values upfrontp  precodeSELECT  FROM myTable WHERE col1  val1 AND col2  val2 AND col2  val3 OR col1  val4 AND col2  val5 AND col2  val5 OR col1  val6 AND col2  val7 AND col2  val8  etc... codepre  pIf I were writing this in SQL, I would consider using a join against a temp table, table valued parameter, or similar construct.  How would I accomplish this with Linq2Sql  My values are not stored in another table, are computed from code and user input, and generally not known in advance  I receive them as a collection of tuples.p  pI know that I cant join against inmemory collections without loading the entire table into memory first, and in those cases am limited to using codeContainscode, resulting in a codeWHERE ... INcode clause.  Is it possible to use this technique for composite keys and tuplesp  pAlternatively, I could manually build the expression tree for the codeWHEREcode clause emulating the codeWHERE ... ORcode clause in my example above.  Is there a better way  I suspect that such a SQL statement will not be very efficient when there are hundreds of codeORcode statements in the clause.p

Negative 82877 pdont think I havent searched online for an answer. Why is it giving me outofbounds errorp  pI have two 6chars long strings. One is daniel and another is . User enters a character. Loop goes through the daniel string and checking char by char is they match with the user input. If it matches, it should replace the guessed char with the one in . So if you input a it should output a and the loop continues. Next if you enter e it should output ae etc. Code gives no compilation error or any warning and also makes perfect sense.

Negative 82877 pIve just had a lastminute design change for a site IE9 that is basically done. Without going into too much detail, most of the site lives within stacked containers which have a maxwidth and are centred using the trusty codemargin 0 autocode approach. The site is responsive, and the content rearranges itself into numerous different configurations across screensizes and is comprised of a mix of custom layouts and sections that are gallerylike that have multiple media items arranged in a multicolumn grid.p  pThe new designs add a series of fullpage full bleed horizontal rules that run across the page between sections and between gallery rows. Obviously given that the site is 1. contained within a series of containers with maxwidths and 2. responsive, this is problematic. I dont want to have to redo the layout to accommodate what is essentially a decoration, and given the varying layout, Im not convinced this would even be possible without lots of extra markup and gymnastics. p  pAfter trying to solve this in a variety of ways, my best attempt is use a pseudo class on a section that needs a rulep  precode  after      position absolute     left calc 100vw  100  0.5     bottom 0     left 0     width 100vw     content      borderbottom 1px solid black    codepre  pThis works reasonably well, but when the element is not both centered and 100 width, this is no good as the rule will be lopsided. Creating different sets of values for different layouts quickly becomes problematic. It also plays badly with scrollbars thanks to some very questionable decisions related to viewport units and scrollbars in the spec essentially code100vwcode is 100 of the window emnot allowing for the scrollbarem. This means that as soon as an inline as opposed to overlaid scrollbar appears, the rules overflow by the width of the scrollbar.p  pA nice solution would have been to just absolutely positioned a pseudo element with left and right set to 0, but I cannot guarantee that the body will be the first use of a position other than codestaticcode while working back up the DOM from the point of use.p  pGiven that using a width that extends past the edges of the viewport causes issues with horizontal scrolling that cant be fixed by setting codeoverflowx hiddencode on codebodycode or codehtmlcode, are there any other approaches or am I going to have to go down the JavaScript routep

And clicking the row will open up another view. p  pI already got the TableLayout, TableRow, ImageView, TextView portion. But how do I make the whole row a clickable option without using buttons And also, is there a way to show an arrow on the right of each row How about different colors for odd and even rows for clearer view p  pLooking forward to your answers and feedbacks.

Negative 82877 pI need to draw lines onto a bitmap using a custom aperture.  In the example below, there are two lines.  The left line is horizontal.  The right line is diagonal  down and to the right img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdJl6h.png altExample image In the example image, the aperture and the path is shown in red.  The resulting geometry is shown in black.  Both of the above examples use the same aperture, but wipe it along a different path.p  pId like to be able to draw with an arbitrary shaped pen, even though the above example only shows rectangles.p  pI made an attempt at using the System.Drawing.2D namespace but it doesnt seem to do what I need it to do.  Using custom endcaps on pens seemed promising, but the end caps rotate with the direction of the line.  Also, getting the linewidth right seems challenging.img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzgfsX.png altfailed endcaps examplep  pstrongIve consideredstrong drawing the aperture over and over again, centered at different points along the path, but that doesnt seem performant.  It is also quite difficult to minimize the number of aperture draws.p  pstrongThe best idea Ive gotstrong is to try to draw the line as a filled shape.  At first, I thought a convex hull algorithm would be the answer  simply take the vertices of the aperture at the beginning of the draw and at the end of the draw and put them through a convex hull algorithm to find the outer vertices.  This works for my 1st example above,  but a starshaped aperture demonstrates that this solution is incomplete.  It only works when the aperture is convex itself. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comnu0aB.png altenter image description herep  pSimply putting all of the vertices through a convex hull algorithm would result in the areas highlighted in blue being filled in, but I need to only fill in the black areas.p

Negative 82877 pI am attempting to optimise a bulk UPDATE statement in Postgres using the UPDATE..FROM syntax to update from a list of values. It works except when the same row might be updated more than once in the same query.p  pFor example say I have a table test with columns key and value.p  precodeupdate test as t set value  v.value from values      key1, update1,      key1, update2       as v key, value  where t.key  v.key codepre  pMy desired behavior is for the row with key key1 to be updated twice, finishing with value set to update2. In practice sometimes the value is updated to update1 and sometimes to update2. Also an update trigger function on the table is only invoked once.p  pThe documentation a hrefhttpwww.postgresql.orgdocs9.1staticsqlupdate.html relnofollowhttpwww.postgresql.orgdocs9.1staticsqlupdate.htmla explains whyp  blockquote   pWhen a FROM clause is present, what essentially happens is that the target table is joined to the tables mentioned in the fromlist, and each output row of the join represents an update operation for the target table. When using FROM you should ensure that the join produces at most one output row for each row to be modified. In other words, a target row shouldnt join to more than one row from the other tables. If it does, then only one of the join rows will be used to update the target row, but which one will be used is not readily predictable.p      pBecause of this indeterminacy, referencing other tables only within subselects is safer, though often harder to read and slower than using a join.p blockquote  pIs there any way to reformulate this query to achieve the behavior Im looking for Does the reference to subselects in the documentation give a hintp

Negative 82877 pIm using Spring Data JPA and have a many to one relationship from Child to Parent Class using hibernate. Im writing a search API which would search on child table using some child table columns and return list of child objects along with some data from Parent class for each child object.

Heres the link to what Ive done so far... a hrefhttpwww.mhoefman.nltmstimer relnofollowhttpwww.mhoefman.nltmstimera p  pThe red reset button should reset all the timers to their original times. The alarm button should be preferably only enabled when the active timer is less than zero. The timer text should be red as soon as the value is less than zero and the time should add up so I could see how much the penalty time is. Pressing any button will pause the countdown in the active field. Pressing it again will start the countdown in the field near it from the value it was on.p  pI have tried to use jQuery.timer.js... but I dont see how I can time all fields independently. p  pThanks a million in advance for even trying to help me p

Negative 82877 pIm fairly new to programming in python and I wanted to make a Binary Search Tree with some implementation.

So what would you replace it with I want my program to replace it with the 24 to make the list more balanced due to the number of nodes 24 has compared to the 52 on the other side.

How can I predict where in memory the vector will go Im excluding the option of using functions that tell the vector where it should be in memory.p
Negative 82877 pOk, so, this is a bit of a weird issue to me. I have this portion of code in my program that uses an if statement to check and see if a page was found in memory, both of which are structs. However, I have an idea of what the output should be and my output is way off so I started checking through some areas to see where it could be coming from and in the process of doing that I ran into this issue. Here in this spot p  precode    ifmemory.memory[i].uidposition            ipages       found1 The page was found in main memory       cout ltlt memory.memory[i].uid ltlt   ltlt position ltlt endl      codepre  pThe cout there is for testing purposes and is how I found this issue. The memory.memory[i].uid is always equal to 0, but the code inside the if statement runs anyway so I get huge blocks of 0  with  increasing as it should be due to the position variable. p  pIs there any possible reason that would happen It just doesnt make sense to me that the code inside the statement is being executed despite the statement being false. Both of the variables in the statement are integers.p  pIm not sure how much more of the code would be needed, its a big program spanning 3 files so I didnt want to include all of it if I can avoid it. If more is needed though I can edit more in. p  pEDIT Wow, Im blind. I just realized Im modifying i before that statement so its not the same i being used in the statement. After fixing it so the statement was before the modification of i the values are matching as they should be, sorry for the waste of time.p

Negative 82877 pI have an ongoing list of image processing tasks to do, using ImageMagick to composite large individual graphic files 20MB each. These images are currently stored on S3 approximately 2.5GB in total.p  pI was thinking to use multiple EC2 instances to process the tasks, composite the images and upload the output file to S3. p  pThe problem with this setup is that ImageMagick needs the file library to be local on the machine. Currently images are on S3, which means each instance would need to download a copy of the images from S3, slowing down the whole process.p  pWhats the best way to share this image library to all nodesp

Negative 82877 pI am having trouble writing what I think should be a simple parser using BoostSpirit. Im using Spirit instead of just using string functions as this is partly a learning exercise for me.  p  h2Datah2  pThe data to parse takes the form of key value pairs, where a value can itself be a key value pair. Keys are alphanumeric with underscores and no digit as first character values are alphanumeric plus code.code  the values can be dates in the format codeDDMMMYYYYcode e.g. code01Jan2015code and floating point numbers like code3.1415code in addition to plain old alphanumeric strings. Keys and values are separated with codecode pairs are separated with codecode structured values are delimited with codecode...codecode.  At the moment I am erasing all spaces from the user input before passing it to Spirit.p  pExample inputp  pcodeKey1  Value1 Key2   NestedKey1Alan NestedKey2  43.1232  Key3  15Jul1974 codep  pI would then strip all spaces to givep  pcodeKey1Value1Key2NestedKey1AlanNestedKey243.1232Key315Jul1974codep  pand then I actually pass it to Spirit. p  h2Problemh2  pWhat I currently have works just dandy when values are simply values.

Negative 82877 pI am using a raspberry pi 2 board with Raspian. In order to be consistent with my mac I created a separate version of Python v2.7.10.

I then updated my path environment so that this directory comes first. The original Python 2.7.3 is located at codeusrbincodep  pNow I need to get pip installed. I downloaded getpip.py and executed it. pip was installed in codeusrlocalbincode, which is not where either versions of Python exists. This doesnt look right to me.

Negative 82877 pI have a few python unit test files. Im copying all those files to a directory, which a file system watcher is listening and firing create event.

Negative 82877 pHeres the situation.  My workplace has a box of checks, years worth for a client.  I want to know if it is possible to scan these in, convert to text, and then have adobe reorder the pages based on the check number.  The pages are all uniform and the check number is in the same place every time.  I was thinking maybe theres a way trick adobe by telling it the check number is actually the page number and then maybe it could do it from there  Any help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 82877 pMy JSP pages use YUI 2.7.0 file uploader, which Im not familiar with at all.

This is because desktop version gets so many data that is not required in mobile, causing current flow to be not optimized.p  pSo, to sum it up, conditionsp  ol limobile detector is already in project declared as a service,li lihomepage address cannot differ from desktop version,li lidesktop and mobile versions should run on separate controllers.li ol  pSo far, only solution that Ive found is to  1. always hit desktop controller,  2. first action to do is to check if request comes from mobile,  3. if yes, then forward internally to mobile homepage controller.p  pSounds good, but I believe it can be done better p  pI have another two theories about how do to that, but I dont want to propose them right now so noone gets influenced. p

Negative 82877 pWhy I need to use Chain of responsibility, if I could load all commands into some container and just execute commands one by one. This will make a chain of processing a request in a row. BTW I feel that it is better than CoR because you can remove some particular commands or replace with another command on runtime, whereas for CoR you need to create another chain to change something in the chain as you dont have assess to elements in the chain except the first element. It is, actually, a single linked list.   p
