Negative 77497 pSo here at work we have a home grown templating system, that is light weight and works great for us so far.  p  pThe wall were hitting is that we want to be able to loop over a template.  The use case is something like search results.  We are trying to think of ways that we could do this.  Weve come up with three ways right now.  First is the good old storing the html inside the loop and then looping over it and using concat to put the variables into the html.  The second way we thought up was including a file repeatedly.  And the third way was to include the file once, use output buffereing to capture its output, add the text echo  to it, and then using eval on it. My boss wanted us to come up with creative ways of doing it.p  pWell, I prefer the include repeatedly method, as it allows us to separate the html from the logic completely.  The eval method also does this, but it seems a little more hackish.  Well we did some time tests on this and found that having the html right inside the loop method one was the quickest, and that was followed by the eval method, and including multiple times came in last.  Including was actually about 56 times slower than the eval method.  We included the fileevaluated the file 1000 times, and did that 100 times and averaged them to get our results.p  pIs there any way to speed up the multiple include  It would appear that each time we do the include php is hitting the file system again. p  pOr does anyone have a way of accomplishing this type of thingp

Negative 77497 pIm in the process of adding connection pooling to our java app.p  pThe app can work with different rdbmses, and both as a desktop app and as a headless webservice. The basic implementation works fine in desktop mode rdbms  derby.  When running as a webservice rdbms  mysql, we see that connection pooling is needed to get good concurrent behaviour. p  pMy initial approach was to use dependency injection to decide between a basic DataSource or a connection pooling DataSource at startup time.p  pThe problem in this scenario is that I dont know when to call connection.close. My understanding is that when using connection pooling, you should close after each query so the connection object can be recycled. But the current nonpooling implementation tries to hang on to the Connection object as long as possible.p  pIs there a solution to this problem Is there a way to recycle a basic connection object What happens if I dont call connection.close with a thread pooled connection object p  pOr is it simply a bad design to mix these two connection strategiesp

Negative 77497 pI plan to create a typical MasterDetail scenario, i.e. a collection of items displayed in a codeListViewcode via DataBinding to an codeICollectionViewcode, and details about the selected item in a separate group of controls TextBoxes, NumUpDowns....p  pNo problem so far, actually I have already implemented a pretty similar scenario in an older project. However, it should be possible to strongselect multiple itemsstrong in the ListView and get the appropriate strongshared values displayedstrong in the detail view. This means, if all selected items have the same value for a property, this value should be displayed in the detail view. If they do not share the same value, the corresponding control should provide some visual clue for the user indicating this, and no value should be displayed or an undefined state in a codeCheckBoxcode for example. Now, if the user edits the value, this change should be applied to emallem selected items.p  pFurther requirements arep  ul liMVVM compatibility i.e. not too much codebehindli liExtendability new propertiestypes can be added later onli ul  pDoes anyone have experience with such a scenario Actually, I think this should be a very common scenario. However, I could not find any details on that topic anywhere.p  pThanksbr gehho.p  pstrongPSstrong In the older project mentioned above, I had a solution using a subclass of the ViewModel which handles the special case of multiselection. It checked all selected items for equality and returned the appropriate values. However, this approach had some drawbacks and somehow seemed like a hack because besides other smelly things it was necessary to break the synchronization between the codeListViewcode and the detail view and handle it manually.p

Negative 77497 pI apologize if this is a duh question. It seems like the answer should be easily googleable, but I havent found it yet.p  pI am working on a large Coldfusion application that stores a large amount of sessionuser data in the Client scope ie ltcfset Client.UserName  JoshuaCgt . I did not write this application, and I dont have the luxury of significantly refactoring it.p  pIve been given the task of setting the Client variables to time out after 72 hours. Im not entirely sure how to do this. If I had written the application, I would have stored the variables in the Session scope, and then changed the sessiontimeout attribute of the CFAPPLICATION tag. As it is though, Im not sure if that timeout affects the Client variables, or what their level of persistence is. The way the application works now, the Client variables never time out, and only clearing the users cookies, or visiting a logout page which sets all the Clientscoped application variables to , will clear the values.p  pOf course, I could create some kind of timestamp variable like Client.LastAccessDateTime, and put something in the Application.cfm to clear the client variables if that datetime is more than 72 hours prior to Now. But theres got to be a better way, rightp

Negative 77497 pFirst the backgroundp  pIn Firefox 3.6.3 on Mac OS X 10.5.8 when entering text into a standard  the hotkey combination of CommandLeftArrow and CommandRightArrow jump the cursor to the startend of the current line, respectively. However, when using CKEditor, FCKEditor and YUI Editor, Firefox does not seem to completely recognize that its a text area. Instead, it drops back to the default function for those hotkeys which is to move backforward in the browser history. After this occurs, the text in the editor is also cleared when you return to the page making it very easy to loose whatever is being worked on. p  pIm attempting to write a greasemonkey script that I can use to capture the events and prevent the page forwardback jumps from being executed. So far, Ive been able to see the events with the following used as a .user.js script in GreaseMonkeyp  precodedocument.addEventListenerkeypress, function evt   grab the meta key var isCmd  evt.metaKey   check to see if it is pressed ifisCmd     if so, grab the key code   var kCode  evt.keyCode    ifkCode  37  kCode  39        alertkCode     codepre  p,   false p  pWhen installedenabled, pressing commandleftright arrow key pops an alert with the respective code, but as soon as the dialog box is closed, the browser executes the page forwardback move. I tried setting a new code with evt.keyCode  0, but that didnt work. p  pSo, the question is, can this Greasemonkey script be updated so that it prevents the backforward page movesp  pNOTE Im open to other solutions as well. Doesnt have to be Greasemonkey, thats just the direction Ive tried. The real goal is to be able to disable the forwardback hotkey functionality.p

Negative 77497 pI have a statically linked library SLL which contains resources such as bitmaps, icons, cursors, etc. And functions in the SLL use those resources. And these exported functions are used by my executable. The problem which I was facing earlier was that the resources were not getting included in the executable while linking. However, I got that resolved thanks to another post in StackOverflow which suggested to link the generated .res file as well.p  pHowever, I wanted a cleaner solution  wherein I just link the .lib file and the resources get included as well. I did a dumpbin on the .lib file and it seems to contain all the resource data, but while linking those resources are not included in the final binary.p  pI suspect that lib.exe generates an output with a mangled resource section name something like .rsrc01 and .rsrc02 which the linker does not recognize as a valid resource section name and hence the confusion.p
Negative 77497 pI need to store element co ordinates of an array2d array, this is for a java maze project.

Negative 77497 pI am interested in building a music visualiser using fractal patterns for my final year project. I have googled quite a lot on it and I know a bit about fractals, however I was wondering what software would be used to animate the graphics. I know Java has a drawing API AWT and Swing  but probably no the best for the animation factor  on the other hand there is also Flash that has new capabilities within as3 to produce such an effect but if this app was to traverse into mobile development, Flash wouldnt be a great choice. So there still exists a grey patch in my head regarding actual app development..Can anyone give me a heads up on where to start lookingp
Negative 77497 pI have an apache server that was initially set up for intranet access, so I didnt have to worry much about locking it down.p  pLater on, I needed to open it up to the internet, so I put an ldap authentication directive in the  section of the httpd.conf like sop  precode Order allow,deny   AuthBasicProvider ldap  AuthType Basic  AuthzLDAPAuthoritative on  AuthName MyCompany Intranet  AuthLDAPURL ldapmyldapserver.mydomain.com389CNUsers,DCmydomain,DCcomsAMAccountNamesubmemberOfCNEveryone at MyCompany,OUMyCompany Groups,DCmydomain,DCcom NONE  AuthLDAPBindDN CNAdministrator,CNUsers,DCmydomain,DCcom  AuthLDAPBindPassword MyPassword   Require validuser   Allow from all  Allow from 192.168.1  Allow from 10.254.0   Satisfy any codepre  pThis basically made it so that local users could get in with no password, and external users had to authenticate against our ADS domain to get in.p  pNow things get more complicated.p  pI have an app that I run that distinguishes between users by appending a cgi variable to the end of a URL, so I setup a .htaccess file in the root of my web directories varwwwhtml as followsp  precodeRewriteEngine on RewriteBase  RewriteRule foo. somereallylongurl1tenantfilter2 [L] RewriteRule bar. somereallylongurl1tenantfilter1 [L] codepre  pThis works really great.

Negative 77497 pWell i guess i ll have to make a trilogy related to the question of mine found at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4853615outofmemoryexceptionwhileloadingimagesOut of memory exception while loading imagesap  pSo here comes the second part.p  pAccording to the answers  comments found to the post mentioned above, sooner or later any computer will run out of memory while executing my code.  p  pBut thanks to a hrefhttpwww.google.com relnofollowGooglea i found a way of applying a hrefhttpcode.logos.comblog200905wrappingstreamimplementation.html relnofollowWrappingStream Implementation.a where according to the writer p  blockquote   pThe BitmapImage keeps a reference to   the source stream presumably so that   you can read the StreamSource property   at any time, so it keeps the   MemoryStream object alive.   Unfortunately, even though   MemoryStream.Dispose has been invoked,   it doesnt release the byte array that   the memory stream wraps. So, in this   case, bitmap is referencing stream,   which is referencing buffer, which may   be taking up a lot of space on the   large object heap. Note that there   isnt a true memory leak when there   are no more references to bitmap, all   these objects will eventually be   garbage collected. But since bitmap   has already made its own private copy   of the image for rendering, it seems   rather wasteful to have the   nowunnecessary original copy of the   bitmap still in memory.p blockquote  pSo here are a couple of questions i have. And Before starting downvoting please keep in mind that i am a newbiep  pCould i use the WrappingStream class to avoid out of memory errors If the first one is true, how can i adopt it and make it work with my a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4853615outofmemoryexceptionwhileloadingimagesexampleap  pThank youp

Negative 77497 pWhich of these two different models would be more efficient consider thrashing, utilization of processor cache, overall desgn, everything, etcp  ol lip1 IOCP and spinning up X threads where X is the number of processors the computer has. This would mean that my server would only have 1 IOCP queue for all requests and X Threads to servehandle them. I have read many articles discussing the effeciency of this design. With this model I would have 1 listener that would also be associated to the IOCP. Lets assume that I could figure out how to keep the packetsrequests synchronized.pli lipX IOCP where X is the number of processors the computer has and each IOCP has 1 thread. This would mean that each Processor has its own queue and 1 thread to servehandle them. With this model I would have a separate Listener not using IOCP that would handle incomming connections and would assign the SOCKET to the proper IOCP one of the X that were created. Lets assume that I could figure out the Load Balancing.pli ol  pUsing an overly simplified analogy for the two designs a bankp  ol lipOne line with several cashiers to hand the transactions. Each person is in the same line and each cashier takes the next available person in line.pli lipEach cashier has their own line and the people are placed into one of those linespli ol  pBetween these two designs, which one is more efficient. In each model the Overlapped IO structures would be using VirtualAlloc with MEMCOMMIT as opposed to new so the swapfile should not be an issue no paging. Based on how it has been described to me, using VirtualAlloc with MEMCOMMIT, the memory is reserved and is not paged out. This would allow the SOCKETS to write the incomming data right to my buffers without going through intermediate layers. So I dont think thrashing should be a factor but I might be wrong.p  pSomeone was telling me that 2 would be more efficient but I have not heard of this model. Thanks in advance for your commentsp

Negative 77497 pWe would like to embed some code in each ASP.NET page that queries its Last Modified Date and displays it at the bottom of the page. p  pIn the past, weve relied on the person making any changes to the page to manually update the emThis page last modified on todays dateem text at the bottom of the page. Many times they forget to update this, which is causing some confusion as to when the information was last updated on that particular page. Since the site is not based on a CMS which could store this information in its backend database, were trying to do the determination as to when the page was last saved from the file system on the server and include that date in the text of the page.p  pIm not sure how a pages being based on a Master Page plays into the last modified date. What were really looking for is for the content page files LMD get queried so we can embed that in the text of the page and not the LMD of the Master Page its based on.p  pThanks p

Negative 77497 pI have a navigation controller inside a popover in an iPad app.  The navigation controller holds a hierarchy of list views. They all can have differing numbers of rows. p  pWhen I navigate from one to the next, and back, I change the content size using codesetContentSizeForViewInPopovercode to the correct table height. This works, and looks good when the popover needs to grow to fit the view.p  pBUT when the new size is smaller than the current popover size, the system seems to start the size animation by blacking out clipping the portion of the view that is about to be truncated, which is an ugly visual artifact.  Ideally, Id like the extra portion of the view to remain visible and just be progressively covered up by the animation.p  pAnyone know a way around this or better way I should be thinking of itp  pThanks.p
Negative 77497 pThis is a dumb question, but its come up at work enough that I feel like asking in order to get a 2nd opinion. You can assume we are using Subversion 1.6.p  pHeres a scenario  lets say I have a Trunk. I branch the Trunk at revision 10 to create a Branch1 and begin making my own changes to Branch1.p  pMeanwhile, Branch2 is created from the Trunk at revision 30. There are several revisions made committed in Branch2.p  pAt some point, work is completed in Branch2 and its changes are merged back into the Trunk WITHOUT using reintegrate. p  pIm still happily working away in Branch1, but I now want to make sure I have ALL of the latest changes from the Trunk and any code changes made in other branches that are merged back into the trunk i.e. Branch2. p  pThe crux of the question  if I merge the Trunk into Branch1, will I see all of the changes that were merged back into the trunk from other branches, like Branch2 Should I have to merge the revisions in the Branch2 URL separately, then merge against the Trunk URL in order to guarantee I have all of the changes p

Negative 77497 pI have started working on an existing project with over 1800 functionalintegration tests.

Negative 77497 pTCP does not prioritize traffic like IP. When there are a lot of TCP background connections opened that are uploading data like when BitTorrent is seeding in background delay may occur for a particular socket because TCP will choose only one socket at a time to send its packets to the IP level.

Negative 77497 pIm in the middle of writing an android app, and id like to externalise some of the features into an external service. I could either use my existing hosting, and write some simple php web services, or do something a little more involved which would have th advantage of me not having to learn php.  Ideally, Id like to write my web services in java because Im already comfortable with writing and securing them.  Im wondering whether this is a sensible use of Ec2, and if so, which AMI would be the best to usep  pany help much appreciated.p

Negative 77497 pSay I have a Game object with many Player objects a baseball game.  The lineup for each game has a specific ordering.p  pAre there any recommendations on how to store ordering for this scenariop  pIf it were only ONE game I could simply store an index in each Player object.  However, this ordering changes for each game.  And so if a Player object gets deleted I want to be sure the Game object gets updated as well maintain referential integrity.p  pFor what I am working on I will ALWAYS have from 2 to 4 players.p  pI tried to create a separate relationship for each player in the Game object, such as playerOne, playerTwo, etc.  However, when I try to create the inverse relationship in the Player object I can only set the Game relationship to one of the players playerOne, playerTwo, etc.p  pThe next thing I may try is to create four inverse relationships in the Player object to point specifically to the relationship in the Game object but I dont think it is correct and would be very messy.p  pAnother option is that I could potentially store the full URL of each player object as a string in the Game object.  However, I would then need to manage deletions and so forth.p  pAny recommendations is appreciated.p
Negative 77497 pRight, after much struggle I finally managed to get a sort of shared folder among my emallem workmates where we can make a common codegitcode repo.p  pGooglin on how to make that work, apparently the only thing I need is to set a magic flag codegit config bool core.bare truecode and everyone is able to happily codepushcode and codepullcode having set the remote as codefilezpathtothatfoldercode.p  pBriliant. But I want more.p  pThere are lots of people who will have access to our files, but do not emgitem then, if you know what I mean p  pNow what I noticed is that after setting the repo as codebarecode the working tree is not updated anymore well... I guess thats exactly the point of setting it codebarecode. What I wish though, is that the working tree always reflected the HEAD of the master branch.p  pEven further, we have actually worked the permissions in a way that the gitless people wont be able to edit the working tree provided that we manage to make it work the way described, but it would be great if any changes in the masterHEAD instantly overwrote whatever was changed in the working tree. i.e. do not bother generating conflicts and merges.p  pAre there any other flags that would make my gits come true p  pthanksp  pf.p

Negative 77497 pIve been reading about the new C11 memory model and Ive come upon the codestdkilldependencycode function sect29.31415. Im struggling to understand why I would ever want to use it.p  pI found an example in the a hrefhttpwww.openstd.orgjtc1sc22wg21docspapers2008n2664.htmselectiveN2664 proposala but it didnt help much.p  pIt starts by showing code without codestdkilldependencycode. Here, the first line carries a dependency into the second, which carries a dependency into the indexing operation, and then carries a dependency into the codedosomethingwithcode function.p  precoder1  x.loadmemoryorderconsume r2  r1gtindex dosomethingwitha[r2] codepre  pThere is further example that uses codestdkilldependencycode to break the dependency between the second line and the indexing.p  precoder1  x.loadmemoryorderconsume r2  r1gtindex dosomethingwitha[stdkilldependencyr2] codepre  pAs far as I can tell, this means that the indexing and the call to codedosomethingwithcode are not dependency ordered before the second line. According to N2664p  blockquote   pThis allows the compiler to reorder the call to codedosomethingwithcode, for example, by performing speculative optimizations that predict the value of codea[r2]code.p blockquote  pIn order to make the call to codedosomethingwithcode the value codea[r2]code is needed. If, hypothetically, the compiler knows that the array is filled with zeros, it can optimize that call to codedosomethingwith0code and reorder this call relative to the other two instructions as it pleases. It could produce any ofp  precode 1 r1  x.loadmemoryorderconsume r2  r1gtindex dosomethingwith0  2 r1  x.loadmemoryorderconsume dosomethingwith0 r2  r1gtindex  3 dosomethingwith0 r1  x.loadmemoryorderconsume r2  r1gtindex codepre  pIs my understanding correctp  pIf codedosomethingwithcode synchronizes with another thread by some other means, what does this mean with respect to the ordering of the codex.loadcode call and this other threadp  pAssuming my understading is correct, theres still one thing that bugs me when Im writing code, what reasons would lead me to choose to kill a dependencyp

Negative 77497 pIm having a strange issue that I think I have a workaround for, but Im trying to do a root cause analysis on.p  pIve been developing an application that runs on an embedded version of Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. When the application starts up, it reads in a config file off of an SD card, initializes a few classes, starts a logger which writes to the SD card, and then proceeds with its operation. During development, it has been running fine when I start it manually through an SSH terminal.p  pIve recently been experimenting with having the application start automatically when the OS starts up. I have a script in init.d which does just that. However, I noticed that no log files are being generated now. I figured out its not a problem with the SD card not being available because the config file gets read properly on startup, but an error is thrown when I attempt to open the log file for writing using fopen.p  precode Open the file mLogFile  fopenfilename, wb ifmLogFile  NULL      printfError opening Log File [d].n, lnRetval     return 1 File couldnt be opened  codepre  pI assumed it was just a permissions problem, but I cant understand why it doesnt work when I automatically start the software versus running it manually in a terminal. Furthermore, I cant understand why the config file gets read in properly but this file cant be opened.p  pThe only difference I could see was that the config file reading is done using fstreams, while the logger is using C file IO. So I experimented by placing the following code directly before the fopen call above homerootetc is where the SD card is mounted.p  precodestdofstream outhomerootetclogtestlog.log out ltlt I can write using fstreams.n out.close codepre  pThat worked and generated the file when started through init.d. Now Im completely stumped. Why does ofstream work and not fopen Is there something fundamentally Im missingp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 77497 pstrong[UPDATE]strong Fixed it will answer later when StackOverflow lets me but basically I installed Web Deployment Projects which is a free addon for VS2010.

Negative 77497 pI have some Qt applications rendered using OpenGL on surfaces provided by an EGL implementation on an ARM board. Im experiencing some kind of tearing in rendering.p  pBy reading around, I found out it may be a problem related to vsync, so I used the EGL call eglSwapIntervaleglDisplay, 1, but still tearing persist. Is that call sufficient to remove tearing Should that call completely remove such an effect Is it possible some tearing remainsp
Negative 77497 pI have created two classes implemented from runnable.  I then call them several times, with varying delay.  The problem is, when I run the runnable later, it needs to know the value of a variable back when the postdelay was called, not when its actually run.p  pI think what I now need to do is pass the variable into the runnable instance when I call the post delay.

This is my first time making a settings page or website in general so maybe its a simple mistake or Im going about it all wrong.

Negative 77497 pI have an application, mostly written in native code, based around NativeActivity. Mostly this runs as a fullscreen activity, and it works fine like this. But for one specific use case I need to be able to run it in the background, headless, communicating with the user via notifications and toasts.p  pThe idiomatic way to do this on Android is to use a Service but I cant do this here, because the code absolutely has to be a NativeActivity because the native code relies on the NativeActivity event model, and before you ask, no, I cant change this.p  pSo I need some way to force the Activity to behave to the user, at least like a Service.p  pThe least bad way I can think of is to somehow make the Activity hidden, so that its running, but is not shown to the user. Theres even a method, Activity.setVisible, which is supposed to do this but when I try it, it doesnt seem to work properly. The Activity appears, but blank, and then vanishes when the application displays its first Dialog. This is on a Honeycomb tablet if that makes a difference.p  pIdeally, of course, I would like a NativeService to go with NativeActivity, but unfortunately such a thing does not seem to exist, and from looking at the source code to NativeActivity, writing a NativeService looks highly nontrivial.p  pSuggestionsp

Negative 77497 pIm using forms authentication to authenticate the users of my system. The problem is the authorization, bellow, I have the table Pages wich is the resources of system. Every user has some profile and every profile has permissions to some resources. Here is the illustration of databasep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7Ly1I.png altenter image description herep  pMy approach to get this work is On aspnet, every Page inherit a class wich get Page url and verify if logged user has permission to access the resource, if not, throw NotAuthorizedException. The problem is that pagemethodsfor jquery access cant be validated since this methods are static only if I intercept ApplicationAuthenticateRequest on global.asaxp  pMy question isbr Is there a better way to authorize the users respecting this database design p

And after that the json response is properly processed and the result can be seen on the page. In IE also similar behavior, proper processing of the json after 20 seconds.p  pIn Chrome, nothing happens for around 20 seconds after which I see an error in the console saying either codeerror undefinedcode or codeFailed to load resourcecode. Alternatively it also prints the below stacktrace  p  precodePOST script.jsp  f.support.ajax.f.ajaxTransport.sendjquery.min.js4 f.extend.ajaxjquery.min.js4 DataTableWidget.extend.fetchBuildingBlockItemsPermissionBBItemsWidget.js91 anonymous functionPermissionBBItemsWidget.js83 e.extend.eachjquery.min.js2 DataTableWidget.extend.loadDataPermissionBBItemsWidget.js82 DataTableWidget.extend.showPermissionBBItemsWidget.js15 anonymous functionpermissionbuildingblocks.html451 xLAB.min.js5 ULAB.min.js5 jLAB.min.js5 ILAB.min.js5 eLAB.min.js5 a.onload.a.onreadystatechange codepre  pI dont understand this weird behavior in different browsers.p  pSo in essence I made sure that p  ol liServer side code returns the response fast. I put in some debug statements and saw the server log. None of the response form server take more than 500ms.li liMade sure than json is properly validated. The fact that after 20 secs it is processed in both IE amp FF without any issues is a proof of that. In addition to use of pythons json.tool.li liSet the dataType to jsonli ol  pSo any pointers on the issue will be a great help. Thanks.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong One more curious thing I noticed. While the request is being processed and I hit the refresh button even within 3 seconds of the original request, the process immediately completes. As in I see changes in the view of course fraction of a second later the page is wiped out due to refresh event. p  pstrongUPDATE 2strong I have noticed that after I slice up my big response by alphabets. The issue of looong response happens in only certain responses. I ran this split long response files through  a hrefhttpjsonformatter.curiousconcept.comjsonformatter relnofollowhttpjsonformatter.curiousconcept.comjsonformattera and although it immediately returns saying that the josn is valid, it takes 20 seconds to actually pretty print the response.

Negative 77497 pHello everyone.p  pI am trying to play a bit with RSA public and private keys and encryptiondecryption with emPyCryptoem and I have encountered and issue that seems kind of strange to me it probably makes a lot of sense the way its working now, but I dont know much about RSA asymmetric encryption and thats why its puzzling me. It is the inability I have encountered to decrypt something having only the public key.p  pHeres the thing I have a server and a client. I want the server to recognize and register the client and show it in a list of known devices. The client will have the public key of the server and the server will have the public key of the client, so when the client communicates with the server, it will encrypt its data with his clients private key and with the servers public key. By doing this, only the proper server will be able to open the data with its private key and will be able to verify that the sender is actually the client that claims to be... well... or at least, thats what I think, because Im pretty newbie in this asymmetric encryption. The idea is that when one of those clients wakes up, it will send its public key encrypted with the servers public key, of course, but thats probably not relevant at this point... yet saying emHey, Im a new client and this is my public key. Register that key with my UUIDem and the server will obey, associating that public key with the clients UUID and use that key to decrypt data coming from that client. I just want to transmit the clients public key, keeping its private key secret, secret, secret its private, rightp  pI am doing some tests with openssl and very simple Python scripts that use emPyCryptoem actually, not even in a serverclient architecture or anything... just trying to encrypt something with a private key and decrypt it with the public keyp  pFirst of all, I have created a publicprivate key set withp  precodeopenssl genrsa out myTestKey.pem passout passf00bar des3 2048 codepre  pOk, first thing that puzzles me a bit... It generates only one file, with both the private and the public keys... Well... Oright... whatever. I can extract the public key withp  precodeopenssl rsa pubout in myTestKey.pem passin passf00bar out myTestKey.pub codepre  pSo I thought I had my couple of private emprivatepublic, actuallyem and public keys in codemyTestKey.pemcode and codemyTestKey.pubcode respectively. Well... apparently Im doing something wrong, because emPyCryptoem doesnt like this assembly. And I dont know why.p  pI have two very simple test scripts, codeencryptor.pycode and codedecryptor.pycode. The codeencryptor.pycode should encrypt something with the private key, and codedecryptor.pycode, decrypt it with the public key. I know... Im a parangon of originality...p  pSo, I encrypt the string emLoren ipsumem with my codeencryptor.pycode with private keyp  p encryptor.py p  precodeusrbinpython  from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA  def encryptmessage     externKeyhomeborrajaxmyTestKey.pem     privatekey  openexternKey, r     encryptor  RSA.importKeyprivatekey, passphrasef00bar     encriptedDataencryptor.encryptmessage, 0     file  opentmpcryptThingy.txt, wb     file.writeencriptedData[0]     file.close  if name  main     encryptedThingyencryptLoren ipsum codepre  hr  pAnd it works fine.

Negative 77497 pI did a test of NFS service over Cisco ASA 5505 firewall.p  pWith normal interface default ACL, which is permit ip any any on inside interface Level 100, deny ip any any on outside interface level 0. NFS server is connected to outside interface. Everything works great. By look at the the packets go through, I can see inside PC call NFS servers 111 port, negotiate  a port using portmap. Finished this TCP connection. Then NFS server outside PC use the negotiated port to connect to inside PC and transfers data. Cisco ASA firewall keep TCP states very well and remembered the negotiated port, thus let outside PC using this port to talk to inside PC even the outside ACL is deny ip any any. The firewall is fully stateful, every thing is great so far.p  pHowever, as long as I connected the NFS server outside PC to Cisco ASA firewall using VPN. Everything changed. By look at the packets, NFS can still go through firewall and negotiate a port by portmap. While after this TCP session is over. Firewall FORGET the negotiated port and block the outside PC using negotiated port to talk back to inside PC.p  pWith or without VPN is the only change. There is just one ACL, on inside interface, permit ip any any. The NFS server is set to can be access from any subnet. There is no NAT and no servicepolicies setup on this firewall.p  pCan anyone please explain why Cisco Firewall rules is not stateful anymore over VPN Is it designed to be What is the best way to let NFS working over VPN without open a range of dynamical ports on outside interfacep

Negative 77497 pFollowing the excellent advice of a poster yesterday I started using the codeshutil.copyfileobjcode method to make a copy of a file. p  pMy program should make an exact copy of the file, remove the last byte and save the new copy. p  pI tested it last night with some very small ASCII text files so I could check it was doing what I asked it too, I have tried it this morning on some actual complex files, a PDF and a JPG and it looks like the copy function is not making a true copy. I looked at the resulting files in a hex editor, and I can see that after  offset 0x300 there is something odd going  either data is being added, or data is being changed on copy. I can not tell which. p  pMy program iteratively takes off a byte and saves a new version, and I can see that the newly created files are consistently different to original file, with the exception of the last bytep  precodedef doNibbleAndSavesrcfile,fileStripped,strippedExt,newpath  counter  interationCounter03d  interationCounterinterationCounter creates the filename counter lable  destfile  newpath    fileStripped    counter  strippedExt creates the new filename   with opensrcfile, r as fsrc   with opendestfile, w as fdest    shutil.copyfileobjfsrc, fdest    fdest.seeknibbleSize, os.SEEKEND sets the number of bytes to be removed    fdest.truncate  srcfile  destfile makes the iterator pick up the newly nibbled file to work on next  return srcfile codepre  pI can also see that the newly created objects are significantly smaller than the source file. p

Negative 77497 pemI feel this question half belongs here and half on Server Fault please let me know if you think theres a better venue for it.emp  pHow does Xen, or indeed, any hypervisor, expose hardware to guest operating systemsp  pFor instance, a guest wanting to communicate on the network at some stage its request must get translated into a request to the NIC. Does the hypervisor expose a dummy network device, which we assume the guest knows how to use Or do paravirtualised guests have knowledge of how to directly make a request for a given piece of hardware If so, what do nonparavirtualised guests dop  pOnce the request is made, who handles it Im guessing the hypervisor has no little knowledge about physical hardware from a driver perspective, so it probably has to come down to the dom0. Rightp  pI ask because I love doing kernel development, but writing drivers is a chore. If I could rely on a dom0 with pretty good hardware support Ubuntu, say, and then just write my kernel to run paravirtualised, andor to make use of some mock device that Xen exposes, that would make my life a lot easier. Its pretty difficult to find documentation on these topics, however, so my next stop is probably to look at a range of Xen guest implementations a hrefhttphalvm.orgwiki relnofollowHaLVMa, a port of GHC for running Haskell software natively as a Xen guest, looks like a good start.p  pThanks and salutationsp  pstrongEditstrong a hrefhttpwww.xen.orgfilesMarketingHowDoesXenWork.pdf relnofollowthis marketing doc from Xen.orga seems to state that the dom0 runs drivers in order to facilitate domUs block device and network access, in line with my guess.

Negative 77497 pI am new to Git and getting below error when I try to push a file Gerritp  p ERRORmissing CHangeID in commit message p  pI have searched for this error, and it is stated that, I should use the hooks.

I have been to the below linep  pa hrefhttpgerrit.googlecode.comsvnhistoryr6114documentation2.1.7errorpushfailsduetocommitmessage.html relnofollowhttpgerrit.googlecode.comsvnhistoryr6114documentation2.1.7errorpushfailsduetocommitmessage.htmlap  pHowever, I am having hard time following there below instructionp  p If such information is missing in the commit message of existing commits e.g. because the commit hook was only configured later rewriting the commits will reexecute the commit hook and so update the commit messages. If you do an interactive rebase to achieve this make sure that the affected commits are really rewritten, e.g. by choosing reword for all these commits and then confirming all the commit messages. Just picking a commit may not rewrite it. p  pCan someone give me step by step instruction how to resolve the issue. p  pThank youp

Negative 77497 pI had been working on a cocos2dx project for the QNX platform and I am now moving to the iPhone platform to finish developing.

I have managed to get it to build just fine, using the dependencies from the pom.xml.p  pHowever, when I actually try to run the JUnit tests, basically all of them fail.

Negative 77497 pIve been reading about this bug in IE7 which makes padding increase in buttons according to the amount of text that they have. I finally solved this by adding codeoverflow visiblecode to the button class, but it seems that, although the buttons are displayed with the correct width, this bug still affects the elements surrounding the buttons. In this case, when the buttons are inside a table cell, the cell becomes much larger than it should be.p  pThe effect can be seen in a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net3YTqN1 relnofollowthis jsfiddlea. The gap between buttons is much smaller in modern browsers and abnormally wide in IE7. Im looking for a way to eliminate this gap, thanks.p  pstrongEDITstrong Well Ill be using Diodeus suggestion, but it would still be interesting to know if theres a fix for this.p

Negative 77497 pIm building an application with KnockoutJS with a component that essentially acts as a sequential spreadsheet.  On different lines users may define variables or use them to represent a value.p  pSo for examplep  precodex 2  x  2 x  4 x  4 codepre  pI have this working in the straightforward case of continuing adding new lines.  The output function for each line checks and iterates backwards to see if the variable was ever defined previously.  If it was it uses the first example it finds and sets that as the value.  This works when initially defining the lines, and also works when you edit a line after a previous line has changed.p  pHowever, I would like variables to update if a previous definition of that variable has changed, been removed, or been added.   That behavior does not exist right now.   I have tried adding my own custom dependency handling code using a map to track the variables, but it badly impacted performance.  I would like to tap into Knockouts dependency management to solve this, but Im not sure of the best way to do so.  Here is a brief summary of my code structure, I would be happy to add more detail if needed.p  pcodecalcFrameworkcode is the viewmodel object I bind to the map.  It consists of an observable list of Lines, a varMap, and other unrelated properties and functionsp  pcodeLinecode is a custom object.

Negative 77497 pThis question is a bit more specific than what the title indicates. Ive tried several methods, hoping to get the request XML to deserialize into an object, with nothing but problems.  Read on, and please just make a suggestion for some ideas for me to look into.p  pThe Problems br br I am stuck receiving a POST in HL7 format.  This is approximately a 55k post with about 200 bytes of useful info in it. I only need to extract those few bytes.  Normally, this will only be about 30 bytes, depending how many tracking numbers are sent to me.  NO, I do not have any say in changing this. br br This HL7 data is in standard XML format, with the exception that a lot of Attributes are used to carry data, instead of Elements.  Again, I seem to be stuck with the sender doing it this way.  My preference, and experience with web services, is the standard MS SoapWSDL setup.  br br I have used XSD.exe to create a class to contain the deserialized data  from some sample XML that will be sent to me. , however, XSD seems to convert all attributes to elements.  When I view the resulting WCF service page, I dont see xml that looks like what I am receiving.  This difference seems to be preventing the deserialization of the HL7 request  See the following abbreviated samples br Sample of an abbreviated inbound requestbecause dealing with the 55k sample was killing my brain, just the first few lines brp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltQUQIIN300102XXX xmlnsurnhl7orgv3 ITSVersionXML1.0gt   ltrealmCode codeXXX gt   ltid extensionXX011111 gt   ltcreationTime value201212201334240500 gt   ltresponseModeCode codeIMMEDIATE gt   ltversionCode codeV3201012 gt   ltinteractionId extensionQUQIIN300102XXX gt   ltprocessingCode codeP gt   ltprocessingModeCode codeT gt   ltacceptAckCode codeNE gt   ltreceiver typeCodeRCVgt     ltrealmCode codeXXX gt     ltdevicegt       ltrealmCode codeXXX gt       ltid extensionXXXIB assigningAuthorityNameService gt     ltdevicegt   ltreceivergt   ltsender typeCodeSNDgt     ltrealmCode codeXXX gt     ltdevicegt       ltrealmCode codeXXX gt       ltid assigningAuthorityNameCCC gt     ltdevicegt   ltsendergt   ltcontrolActEventgt     ltrealmCode codeXXX gt     ltid extensionTracking assigningAuthorityNameTRANSTYPE gt     ltcode codeOrder gt     ltstatusCode gt     ltqueryByParametergt       ltrealmCode codeXXX gt       ltqueryId extensionNJ011111A20121220133343 gt       ltparameterListgt         ltrealmCode codeXXX gt         ltaccessionNumgt           ltvalue extensionNJ011111A gt         ltaccessionNumgt         ltbatchNumbergt           ltvalue extension120927001 assigningAuthorityNameZZ1 gt           ltvalue extension120927002 assigningAuthorityNameZZ1 gt         ltbatchNumbergt codepre  pbr br The batchNumber is the primary data I need to get from the inbound request. br If I view the WCF project service help page  created by using the WCF REST project type nuget package, if I remember correctly , I get brp  precodeltQUQIIN300102QDgt   ltrealmCodegt ltrealmCodegt   ltcodegtString contentltcodegt ltrealmCodegt ltrealmCodegt   ltcodegtString contentltcodegt ltrealmCodegt   ltrealmCodegt   ltidgt ltidgt   ltextensiongtString contentltextensiongt   ltassigningAuthorityNamegtString contentltassigningAuthorityNamegt ltidgt ltidgt   ltextensiongtString contentltextensiongt   ltassigningAuthorityNamegtString contentltassigningAuthorityNamegt ltidgt   ltidgt   ltcreationTimegt     ltQUQIIN300102QDCreationTimegt   ltvaluegtString contentltvaluegt    ltQUQIIN300102QDCreationTimegt   ltQUQIIN300102QDCreationTimegt     ltvaluegtString contentltvaluegt    ltQUQIIN300102QDCreationTimegt   ltcreationTimegt codepre  pbr br Now, the XML that I fed into XSD.exe does not look like what the service page hands out, and for whatever reason, when I pass in the post request, it will not deserialize. br br I hope thats enough information to describe my problem. br br What is my best choice for a solution br Create an MVC project and accept an XMLDoc as the post datatype, and do XML manipulations to get what I need Or some other option br FYI, the return data has to be inserted into the XML at some point, but I havent gotten that far yet. br br FYI, my experience with creating web services has been limited to VS.  You know, File, New Project, Web Service.  Then adding a proxy to the WSDL page in the consuming project and just using the thing.  With, of course, a third project just containing the class objects for reference by the other two projects, and some dataaccess project. br br Using Fiddler to compose my requests, and I have WCF tracing turned on. br What I get from the trace is brbrp  pUnable to deserialize XML body with root name Binary and root namespace  for operation methodTrackQLSBatch and contract ShipmentTracking,  a hrefhttptempuri.org relnofollowhttptempuri.orga using XmlSerializer. Ensure that the type corresponding to the XML is added to the known types collection of the service. brbr It DOES know the type.  If I change everything around to use a very simple piece of XML, it deserializes perfectly.  brbr Thank you in advance for any thoughts. brbr I guess to put it succinctly, how can I accept this large HL7 request, extract data from it, insert results into it, and then return it   And I can probably figure out the return it portion, heh.  Although you never know. p

Negative 77497 pSo I asked this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14883333googlechromeissuewithfixedpositionandmargintopgoogle chrome issue with fixed position and margintopa which finally got me to realize that codetopcode and codemargintopcode are not the same thing. I dont know how Ive missed that all these years.p  pAnyways that got me thinking what is the difference exactly between codemargintopcode and codetopcode, which is how I found this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4036176csstopvsmargintopCSS Top vs Margintopa. p  pI already knew what codemargintopcode did. But I had never extrapolated that out to think hmm, this element is not in the DOM flow so what exactly is codemargintopcode pushing it away fromp  pFrom the question I asked I know that codemargintopcode behaves in very unexpected ways when applied to an element with a codefixedcode position. And that in Chrome at least this can lead to some crazy rules like codemargintop 273code.p  pSo my Question is How emdoem browsers apply codemargincode rules to elements not in the DOM flow i.e. elements with a codepositioncode value of codefixedcode or codeabsolutecode . And what about the way they are applied and rendered leads to rules, like the one described above, actually rendering the element eminsideem the viewportp

Negative 77497 pSo according to this  a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosDOCUMENTATIONiPhoneConceptualiPhone101Articles01CreatingProject.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40007514CH3SW3 relnofollowtutoriala p  pXcode uses the product name you entered to name your project and the app. Xcode uses the codeclass prefixcode name to name the classes it creates for you. For example, Xcode automatically creates an app delegate class and names it HelloWorldAppDelegate. If you enter a different value for the class prefix, then the app delegate class is namedp  pHowever when I create my project, it doesnt create the files with my project name. So instead of codeProjectNameAppDelegate.hcode I just have codeAppDelegate.hcode.

I do have a MainStoryboard.storyboard but Im not sure if that counts as the same thing. p

Negative 77497 pIm trying to speed up the startup for my program, and noticed I had a method that was acting a little strange. The program itself is an LWJGL application that reads in points from a file, and renders them. The method of note is the method that reads from the file.p  pWhats curious about the method is I call it twice during my tests, where the first call takes 2837ms to complete, and the second only takes 1704ms.p  pThe difference between the two calls are minimal.

Negative 77497 pI have applied custom validation techniques and messages for my application. I have used validation for HTML fields like thisp  pNumber only fields   assigned input tags with datatypenumber or typenumber and handled in scripts with digits ASCII characters to be allowed in the particular field.p  pEvery field which is mandatory has an attribute required and same is handled for validation for empty entries.p  pThe above two example validations are used in our application. The issue is now that our application is also used by Japanese clients all validations work fine for English, but in Japanese everything goes thisthat way.p  pFor fields, typenumber in Japanese  hiragana mode we can type in Japanese characters and numbers both. Date fields are taking input likewise  instead of 26062013p  pHow can we achieve validation for both English and Japanese at one gop  pI have seen a hrefhttpjqueryvalidation.org relnofollowhttpjqueryvalidation.orga which validates a form only.

Negative 77497 pi need to run a wcf service in our office server and want to access that service from out side of office. i test the wcf service in LAN and it is working fine. our office has static ip. some one told me that port forwarding is required to access that wcf service from out side of office. i have no access to our office routine and that is why i can enter into router amp can not forward any port from there. so i have decided i have to do port forwarding programmatically by c. so looking for guidance which library i can use to do port forwarding using c.p  pif i do not know the router login then a c program can enable port forwarding  i like to also know what port forwarding does  does it save any data in router or any pcp  pguide me in details how can i enable port forwarding for my wcf service if i do not have access office router and want to enable the access of wcf service running in a office pc from out side  looking for great discussion. thanksp  h2updatedh2  pi have found one link a hrefhttppietschsoft.compost200902NETFrameworkCommunicatethroughNATRouterviaUPnP.aspx relnofollowhttppietschsoft.compost200902NETFrameworkCommunicatethroughNATRouterviaUPnP.aspxap  pit is using com comonet for port forwarding. i have confusion about the picture they have shown. please have a look and tell me. here is the pic. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdYuPS.png altenter image description herep  paccording to the pic we need to mention external ip, external port and internal ip amp port. if my wcf service is running on port 7756 then do i need to specify the same port for external amp internal portp  pwhat ip i need to specify as external amp internal IP if machine ip is 192.168.6.2 where my wcf service is running locally and if our office static ip is 122.160.187.236 then how i need to specify ips for external amp internal purpose please help me with information. thanksp
Negative 77497 pSo, Im writing or have written a contour mapping application for mapping power frequency in North America, and it works really well... On linux. I run it on a loop to update a bmp map file, which Im eventually going to output on a website. It can run and update itself in about 3 seconds, which is great for me. The problem came when I tried to port the application to windows. I moved the code into Visual Studios 2012. Linked the libraries, compiled and such, I had to make it ignore a few warnings about float to integer conversion, but I got it working.p  pThen, I had it run, and it didnt seem to do anything. But, after adding a few output commands, I realized it strongwasstrong doing something, it was just doing it probably 100x slower than the Linux executable I mean, admittedly, the code is pretty intensive around 400,000 iterations, but this is just ridiculous.p  pI saw a lot of other topics about VS running slow in debug mode, but even after I compile and run an executable, its still just as slow.p  pHeres relevant code, let me know if you have any ideas. Some of the functions you wont recognize because either they arent relevant to performance I only call them once, and I know they arent the source of the speed problem or they come from the Easy BMP library Im using for image manipulation.

Negative 77497 pHeres what i want to dobr I want to load a model most likely .3ds into my .swf and be able to rotate it with the mouse.br This works fine at first glance, but theres problem, the rotations switch over. Or to say it differentlyp  pImagine we have a model in the shape of a pipe. If we drag the mouse to the right, the model rotates along its XAxis to the left, mouse to the left, XAxis rotation to the right, moving the mouse up, YAxis rotation downward, mouse down, YAxis rotation upward.br Now, lets say we turn the pipe to the right or left, until we face the former backside of the pipe, and then we move the mouse down. The model will rotate downward instead of upward.p  pI hope you understand what i mean with this. Ive been looking around for a good while now and never found a satisfying solution. There was talk about quaternions, but i cant grasp them.br Another suggestion i read somewhere is the followingbr create a Matrix3D object, apply rotation on it, then multiply it with the desired Matrix3D of my 3dModel. p  pI tried to do it, but the result stays the same, the directions of rotation switches depending on what side im facing.p  precodeprivate function updateeEventvoid     xCalc  0.3stage.mouseX  lastMouseX    yCalc  0.3stage.mouseY  lastMouseY     ifmove           var objTransformMatrix3D  new Matrix3D        objTransform.prependRotationxCalc, Vector3D.YAxis, objC.pivotPoint       objTransform.prependRotationyCalc, Vector3D.XAxis, objC.pivotPoint        mesh.transform  multiply3DMatricesmesh.transform, objTransform          lastMouseX  stage.mouseX     lastMouseY  stage.mouseY      view.render   codepre  pmultiply3DMatrices simply multiplies two 4x4 Matrices together.p  pobjC is the ObjectContainer3D that holds my model. For some reason i cannot rotate it properly, unless i manipulate the rotationXYZ properties.p  pmesh is the mesh inside of the Model which is very simple, a single mesh.p  pAlso, im aware that i could try another Framework for this like papervision but this project requires me to use Away3D.p

Negative 77497 pI have a suite of Webdriver tests in NUnit that I have running repeatedly on a TeamCity server. Im getting the driver type from a config file that is altered between test runs this was the most elegant way of doing crossbrowser testing within NUnit that I could come up with. Fortunately, TeamCity combines the output of all the test runs quite neatly. Unfortunately, when a test fails more than once, only one failure and its accompanying stack trace is displayed, with an annotation of 2 failures in one build. Since these are actually different tests, being in different browsers, I would like to view the error outputs separately. Is there a way to do thisp

So I added a lot of output to log and prepared a simple java test for that. all the code is listed below, but project can be found in a hrefhttpsgithub.comYaMikeJavaServiceTest relnofollowthis repository at githuba as well.br brList of the files of the projectp  pServicep  ul liTestService.java li liTestController.javali liTestListener.javali listrongTestNative.java   ltlt java method is herestrongli ul  pNative codep  ul listronglayerjni.c       ltlt native call is herestrongli ul  pOtherp  ul liAndroid.mkli liApplication.mkli liAndroidManifest.xmlli ul  pAll files are listed below.p  pI tried the following logic in test servicep  p1.Service is startedp  pstrongTestService.javastrongp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepackage com.example.testservice  import java.lang.String  import android.app.Notification import android.app.PendingIntent import android.app.Service import android.content.Intent import android.os.Handler import android.os.HandlerThread import android.os.IBinder import android.os.Looper import android.os.Message import android.util.Log import android.widget.Toast  public class TestService extends Service      private Looper mServiceLooper     private ServiceHandler mServiceHandler     private TestController testCtrl  null     private static final String TAG  TestService      private final class ServiceHandler extends Handler           public ServiceHandlerLooper looper                         superlooper                    Override          public void handleMessageMessage msg                   Log.eTAG, msg.toString                  Log.eTAG, IT WORKS                     Override     public IBinder onBindIntent intent          return null          public void onDestroy          Toast.makeTextthis, Test service stopped, Toast.LENGTHLONG.show         Log.dTAG, Test has been stopped           Override     public void onCreate          super.onCreate         Log.iTAG, onCreate         HandlerThread thread  new HandlerThreadServiceStartArguments,                            android.os.Process.THREADPRIORITYBACKGROUND         thread.start          mServiceLooper  thread.getLooper         mServiceHandler  new ServiceHandlermServiceLooper           Override     public void onStartIntent intent, int startid                       if testCtrl  null              Log.dTAG, Service already running.             return                  Log.dTAG, Starting test controller         testCtrl  new TestController         Log.dTAG, Test controller has started        codepre  p2.It creates TestController class where most of the logic must be which creates TestNative class.p  pinterface strongTestListener.javastrongp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepackage com.example.testservice  public interface TestListener      public void stringJavaMethodString regStr  codepre  pstrongTestController.javastrongp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepackage com.example.testservice  import android.util.Log  public class TestController implements TestListener      private static final String TAG  TestController     private TestNative mTestNative  null      TestController          Log.dTAG, Starting test native         mTestNative  new TestNativethis           Override     public void stringJavaMethodString regStr          Log.dTAG, Callback calledn         Log.eTAG, regStr      codepre  pp  pstrongTestNative.javastrongp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepackage com.example.testservice  import android.os.Handler import android.util.Log  public class TestNative implements TestListener      static          System.loadLibrarylog         System.loadLibrarylayerjni           private static final String TAG  TestNative     private Handler mHandler     private TestListener mDelegate      TestNativeTestListener t          mDelegate  t         mHandler  new Handler         startAthread           Override     public void stringJavaMethodfinal String regStr          Log.dTAG, IT WORKS  regStr         mHandler.postnew Runnable              public void run                  Log.eTAG, CALLEDn                 mDelegate.stringJavaMethodregStr                                      native interface      public static native void startAthread  codepre  p3.TestNative class asks native library to start working via startAthread method.br 4.Native code stores JVM, makes a global reference for calling object and starts a thread.br 5.Thread attaches himself to JVM and gets a new JNIEnv pointer.

This takes sometime and Id rather avoid it.  li liProject b expects different paths when running alone. loadNpmTasks fails unless I codegrunt.file.setBasecode, but then I have other paths that are broken as well. This means I need to manually track all of those down and make sure they are correct in both situations.

Negative 77497 pWhat is the correct syntax for performing a validation on before a transition in the a hrefhttpsgithub.compluginaweekstatemachinestatemachinea gemp  pIve tried the following,p  precodebeforetransition apple gt orange do   validate validatecore end  def validatecore   if core.things.blank     errors.addcore, must have one thing   end end codepre  pBut I get the following error,p  precodeundefined method validate for ltStateMachineMachine0x007ffed73e0bd8gt codepre  pIve also tried writing it as,p  precodestate orange do   validate validatecore end codepre  pBut this causes a rollback after the record is saved, which is less than ideal. Id like to stop the state machine from transitioning into codeorangecode in the first place.p  pThe core problem is that in my controller I have logic that relies on the result of codeobject.savecode. The validation I have for my state machine doesnt kick in until after the initial save, so save gets returned as true and the controller goes on to logic it shouldnt hit if the object isnt valid.p  pIve worked around this by testing the validity manually in addition to checking the save, but it feels like there should be a way to have the validation fire before the object saves. p

Negative 77497 pIm working on a WPF application running on a multitouch tablet that currently uses an codeInkCanvascode to capture ink. Unfortunatelly, the codeInkCanvascode not only captures ink when a user uses a Stylus, but also when a user draws strokes with his fingers. As I am not interested in these fingergenerated strokes, I am looking for a way to detect the type of the currently present Stylus device such that I can just ignore strokes generated by a finger completely.p  pUnder normal conditions, I would use codeStylus.CurrentStylusDevice.TabletDevice.Typecode. However, things get a bit complicated because of the codeInkCanvascode. Regardless of the currently present Stylus device, codeStylus.CurrentStylusDevicecode always returns codenullcode when called from a custom codeDynamicRenderercode which is responsible for rendering ink dynamically while the user is writing on the tabletcodeInkCanvascode. I think the reason for this is the fact that a codeStylusPlugIncode like a codeDynamicRenderercode runs in its own thread before the normal WPF UI thread responds to the input...p  pSo my question is How can I detect the type of the currently present Stylus device from within a codeStylusPlugincode like the codeDynamicRenderercodep

Negative 77497 pI am interested in using the SQLDataAdapter with the DataTable and associated InsertUpdateDelete Command operations that I can attach to the Adapter object. My question is this. Does each row in the datatable used necessarily need to correspond to any one physical table  What I would like to be able to do is allow a single row to represent columns that span multiple tables and then craft each of the insertupdate commands to handle their operations across these tables. That would mean that what I assign to the command might actually be a more complex sql statement even wrapped in BEGINEND so that I can insert into the first anchor table then use that primary key and for the foreign key column of the subsequent column.p  pSo far all the examples I see relate to each data table representing a single table. I realize that I could perhaps use a dataset but then how would I attach a command relative to each data table within the set. Furthermore how then could I relate the rows from table to the rows of the dhild table.p  pAnyone try this p

Negative 77497 pIn the release notes of iText 5.4.4 it saysp  blockquote   pFrom now on you can now merge forms and preserve the tagged PDF   structure when using the addDocument method in PdfCopy. At the same   time, weve deprecated PdfCopyFields.p blockquote  pI try to merge multiple pdf documents into one pdf document. If one of these documents is a pdf form with acroFields, those fields will be invisible in the output document. This is the case when I use the addDocument method in PdfCopy. When I use the addDocument method in PdfCopyFields it works fine. PdfCopyFields is deprecated in iTextSharp, but is PdfCopy working correctly There is another reason not to use PdfCopyFields from iText in Actionp  blockquote   pDont use PdfCopyFields to concatenate PDF documents without form   fields.

This only happens when the Mule server is running it is important to note that the app gets deployed in the Mule server without issue, when it is not, of course the provider doesnt attempt any deliveries which is expected.  Ive used the hornet config in other apps to setup message listeners to the same HornetQ instance without issue.  Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltmule xmlnshttpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulecore     xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance     xmlnsbeanshttpwww.springframework.orgschemabeans     xmlnsjmshttpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulejms     xsischemaLocationhttpwww.springframework.orgschemabeans httpwww.springframework.orgschemabeansspringbeans4.0.xsd         httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulecore httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulecore3.4mule.xsd         httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulejms httpwww.mulesoft.orgschemamulejms3.4mulejms.xsdgt      ltbeansbean idhornetConnectionFactory classorg.hornetq.jms.client.HornetQXAConnectionFactorygt         ltbeansconstructorarg nameha valuefalse gt         ltbeansconstructorarggt             ltbeansbean classorg.hornetq.api.core.TransportConfigurationgt                 ltbeansconstructorarg valueorg.hornetq.core.remoting.impl.netty.NettyConnectorFactory gt                 ltbeansconstructorarggt                     ltbeansmap keytypejava.lang.String valuetypejava.lang.Objectgt                         ltbeansentry keyhost valuelocalhostgt                         ltbeansentry keyport value5445gt                     ltbeansmapgt                 ltbeansconstructorarggt             ltbeansbeangt         ltbeansconstructorarggt     ltbeansbeangt      ltbeansbean idcachingConnectionFactory classorg.springframework.jms.connection.CachingConnectionFactorygt         ltbeansconstructorarg refhornetConnectionFactory gt     ltbeansbeangt      ltbeansbean idtransactionalConnectionFactory classorg.springframework.jms.connection.TransactionAwareConnectionFactoryProxygt         ltbeansproperty nametargetConnectionFactory refcachingConnectionFactory gt         ltbeansproperty namesynchedLocalTransactionAllowed valuetrue gt     ltbeansbeangt      ltjmsconnector namejmsConnector specification1.1 connectionFactoryreftransactionalConnectionFactory         validateConnectionstrue acknowledgementModeAUTOACKNOWLEDGE disableTemporaryReplyToDestinationstrue gt      ltflow nameMyFlowgt         ltjmsinboundendpoint connectorrefjmsConnector queueMyQueue             exchangepatternoneway gt         ltlogger messageMessage [payload.id] processed successfully levelDEBUGgt     ltflowgt  ltmulegt codepre

Negative 77497 pI have a rails 3.2 app running on Heroku which needs to proxy requests to an external API from a static IP address. Since Heroku doesnt offer elastic IPs, and Proximo is too expensive and limiting for the number of requests I need to make, I set up a simple forward proxy on an AWS EC2 micro instance in USEast using mod proxy.p  pI can proxy requests from my apps local environment just fine. However, requests from heroku time out. My thinking is that, since I can proxy from my local environment, the point of failure must be the connection between Heroku and my Proxy box.  Ive tried the answer given here a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions8636835securitysettingsbetweenamazonec2instanceandherokuSecurity settings between ec2 and herokua but it didnt work.  Ive even tried allowing all inbound access on port 80 even though thats terrible for the internet.p  pSo, my question is, what are the security settings that I should enable for my ec2 instance in order to allow Heroku to proxy through itp

Negative 77497 pI have been running into a weird issue for some time with php now and wonder if anybody can help. Its probably a totally minor stupid thing I dont see.p  pif statements dont seem to work for me when I use ampamp and  for logical expressions. Latest examplep  precodeisNotSet  issetmoved  vardump prints false moveSuccess  moved instanceof SuccessNotification  vardump prints true ifisNotSet  true moveSuccess  true codepre  pthe script always breaks at exactly that line and doesnt go any further. It wont execute anything after this. I have tried lots of things, e.g.p  precodeifissetmoved moved instanceof SuccessNotification codepre  porp  precodeifissetmoved  true moved instanceof SuccessNotification codepre  porp  precodeisNotSet  issetmoved moveSuccess  moved instanceof SuccessNotification ifisNotSet  true moveSuccess  true codepre  pAll dont work. Im aware they all mean the same, I was just trying to eliminate the thought of being on the wrong track. Some of those examples are marked as syntax error in Netbeans, but not all of them, which got me thinking.p  pId like to know whats going on here because this limits coding a lot. But as I said, I probably overlook a totally simple thing.p  pedit the script breaks without any errors or warnings shown, it just stops working at that linep  pedit2 I took the snippet and executed it on its own.p  precodemoved  new SuccessNotificationcode, title, message echo 1 isNotSet  issetmoved echo 2 moveSuccess  moved instanceof SuccessNotification echo 3 ifisNotSet  true moveSuccess  true 1     echo 4     else     echo 5      echo 6 codepre  pThis prints 123, nothing else. And yes, I have included the SuccessNotification class otherwise there would have been an error anyways which is being used systemwide already and properly working, just removed that line for posting here. I take it that nobody really has a clue and therefore tries to find a simple solution which is ok because I thought its just a simple thing. But I realize I have tried everything you suggest or would do in this situation.p

Negative 77497 pIn my code I have an arbitrary number of processes exchanging some parts of their local vectors. The local vectors are vectors of pairs and for this reason Ive been using an MPI derived datatype. In principle I dont know how many elements each process sends to the others and for this reason I also have to send the size of the buffer. In particular, each process exchanges data with the process with rank myrank1 and with the process with rank myrank1. In case of process 0 instead of myrank1 it exchanges with process with rank commsize1. And as well in case of process commsize1 instead of myrank1 it exchanges with process with rank 0.

Thanks p  pSo now, p  pI have a Wordpress site which works with jQuery so that the user never reloads the page. Content slides in and out. I have WooCommerce set up so that when the user clicks on a cart widget which displays the number of items in the cart and the total, the cart page containing all the products, prices, thumbnails and checkout buttons slides in. The problem Im having is that, though the cart widget updates without having to reload Im using WP Menu Cart plugin for this, the page itself does not. The cart widget will say 1 item 200 but the cart page will say your cart is empty.p  pIf I reload the page, the cart page will be updated. I need to update the cart page which is on a div called cart without reloading the whole page.p  pHeres the relevant code. p  pIm calling my cart page inside the index.php file using this p  precodeltdiv idcartgt ltphp  id650  post  getpostid  content  applyfiltersthecontent, postgtpostcontent  echo content   gt ltdivgt codepre  pI found some jQuery code that should reload the div using .load but it didnt work. I guess maybe it does work but the content hasnt changed yet so it just loads up the same thing Here it is. The first few lines prevent it from reloading the whole page and then do my slide animation.p  precodejQueryfunction    wpmenucartli.clickfunctione  e.preventDefault sectionsMove,.currentSection,cart   cart.loadcheckout.php  return false           codepre  pI imagine the answer might lie in a better understanding of how and when WooCommerce reloads the cart content but their documentation hasnt yielded any leads. p  pAgain I appreciate the helpp

I also tried changing to version 1.11.0 but that also did not make a difference.li liI saw a suggestion that adding ampcallback to the end of the url would solve it but that didnt make a difference.li ul  pI am probably forgetting something that I tried today but that should be most of it.p  pHere is the code I have at the moment p  precodejQuery.support.cors  true        var request  .ajax                crossDomain true,         type GET,         url url,         success function             console.logsuccess         ,         error function a, status, error            console.logerror   error         ,         complete function             console.logcomplete                 codepre  pChrome, Firefox, and Safari log success and complete in the console.

Negative 77497 pI have a vector a large buffer of strings which I hope to read from a network thread while it is being written to by the main thread. p  pAs codevectorcode is not threadsafe, the typical approach would be to lock the access to it from both threads. p  pHowever my insight has been that this should be only strictly necessary when the particular write will resize the vector, which will cause the realloc, which will cause any concurrent readers to have their carpet yanked. At all other times, provided that the concurrent reader is not reading the entry currently being written to, reading and writing to the vector should be allowed to happen concurrently.p  pSo, Id want to emsomehowem only lock the mutex from the write thread when I know that the write I am about to do will cause a resize operation that will realloc the vector. p  pIs this practical Can I deduce based on the value returned by codecapacitycode and the current size, strongfor certainstrong whether or not the next codepushbackcode will resizep

Negative 77497 pIve read some documentation of the Fortify static checking tool. One of the concepts used by this tool are called emtaintsem. Some sources, such as web requests, provide data that is tainted in one or more ways and some sinks, such as web responses, require the data to be untainted. p  pThe nice thing about Fortify is that you can have several types of taints. For example, you could tag codesrandcode output with codeNONCRYPTORANDcode and then require that this taint is not present when using the variable for crypto purposes.

dynamically and have added click event on table cell.But when I click the table cell whole table gets invisible.I have used asp table before for doing same type of things,at that time also I got the same error but at that time it got resolved when I placed the create table method outside the post back method in page load event.But here I am calling my create time table method on drop down selected index change.I have tried by placing my asp table inside update panel but that also havent solved my problem.p  pFollowing is my aspx codep  precodeltaspPanel IDpnltimetable runatserver

Negative 77497 pWe are currently facing a design problem implementing a SCORM LMS System. For example, the API defined a function LMSCommit which must return either true or false. Within that method, our LMS has to make an asynchronous call to a server side service, using a callback function containing the success or failure message in its argument.

Negative 77497 pI have a project hosted on Github, and I would like to set it up such that the project has a version number, and the version number is only updated when the master branch is updated, either directly by a push, or via a merged Pull Request. p  pIs there any way to let gitBitbucket update a specific number in a specific file It is OK if there is just a dedicated file for this purpose, containing a single number.

Requires flot 0.7 or higher and a browser supporting ltcanvasgt.   To activate, just set xaxis.rotateTicks to an angle in degrees.

There are no hooks in Flot between          the creation and measuring of the ticks setTicks, measureTickLabels          in setupGrid  and the drawing of the ticks and plot box          insertAxisLabels in setupGrid .                   Therefore, we use a trick where we run the draw routine twice          the first time to get the tick measurements, so that we can change          them, and then have it draw it again.          var ticks  []  preserve between draw calls.         var font         var secondPass  false         var rotateTicks, rotateTicksRads, radsAboveHoriz          plot.hooks.draw.pushfunction plot, ctx              var xaxis  for convenience             if secondPass                  var opts  plot.getAxes.xaxis.options                 if opts.rotateTicks  undefined                      return                                   rotateTicks  parseIntopts.rotateTicks, 10                 if rotateTicks.toString  opts.rotateTicks  rotateTicks gt 180    rotateTicks  0                      return                                   rotateTicksRads  rotateTicks  Math.PI180                 if rotateTicks gt 90                      radsAboveHoriz  Math.PI  rotateTicksRads                  else                      radsAboveHoriz  Math.PI2  rotateTicksRads                                   font  opts.rotateTicksFont                 if font                      font  .tickLabel.cssfont                                  if font                      font  arial                                   var elem, maxLabelWidth  0, maxLabelHeight  0, minX  0, maxX  0                   We have to clear the ticks option so that flot core                  doesnt draw ticks superimposed with ours, but we preserve                  the tick data as xaxis.rotatedTicks so that external code                  can still get to it.                   FIXME It would obviously be better to just interrupt                  the drawing of the ticks and preserve the ticks                  property.

Negative 77497 pIm not really sure how to fix this, but its rather annoying and screwing up things for me in production. Im using kue.js to complete a task after a user has done something. The most typical case on my site is for uploading images and sending emails.p  pIt works most of the time, but other times, it seems that some jobs may not complete or they get in a weird ordering so that when they actually DO finish, the data thats returned from them is out of order, so when it does a database update in the callback of the task, itll write the wrong image.p  pIm pretty new to job queues in general, so if Im missing something obvious, please dont hurt me.

Negative 77497 h3THE PROBLEMh3  pIm looking for a way to decrease the 4050 second wait every time our SASS needs to compile into main.css. Ive already gotten it down from over a minute by switching from using Compass for compiling to using gruntcontribsass. I need to get it down to 510 seconds, or as close to that as possible.p  h3CANT USE LIBSASSh3  pIm a little bit stuck using SASS 3.3 and Compass unless we absolutely have to switch for the performance. We do use bootstrapsass so it would be hard to get rid of Compass entirely. This means we cant easily switch to libsass. But any code in Compass can also be copied from their repository directly into our mixins partial so anything is possible with enough effort.p  h3USER THEMESh3  pThe worst thing for our speed by far is that we have different usergroups, each with their own set of variables used to compile the SASS with a custom theme. So our SASS needs to compile once for the main theme, main.css, and then once more for each usergroup in the system to make their theme.css. As we add users the compile time that results when any of our main partials are changed increases linearly. Any suggestions to speed this up are also welcome.p  h3REPLACE IMPORT WITH REQUIREh3  pI read on the TreeHouse blog that import slows things down a lot when using the stock Ruby SASS compiler. We do have a lot of partials, and the user themes as well, and we have bootstrapsass rigged to compile using our variables instead of bootstraps default ones. So there are a lot of import statements. TreeHouse used Sprockets in their Rails project, replacing import with require, to speed up their 1min SASS compilation to something like 3 seconds. Django has a port of Sprockets called djangogears, could implementing that have the same effect on our SASS Can we use djangogears together with grunt There doesnt seem to be much mention of using the technologies together in the Googlesphere. edit found the article I was talking about, updated this section. a hrefhttpblog.teamtreehouse.comtalefrontendsanitybewaresassimport relnofollowhttpblog.teamtreehouse.comtalefrontendsanitybewaresassimportap  pEdit 2 No, Grunt and djangogears dont really work together. I dont think we need to use Gears to achieve this effect though. Im going to  try using some sort of Grunt file concatenation plugin to replace the Sass import statements, Ill report back here about what it does to our compilation time.p  h3CONCLUSIONh3  pAnyway, thats all the research Ive done so far, pretty much. We could rewrite our SASS to work with libsass, which would be tough and take a decent amount of time. We can implement djangogears to possiblymaybe speed things up using require. Or, not mentioned yet, we can replace Grunt with Gulp. Gulp seems to have a slightly faster version of gruntcontribsass but might cause trouble if we need a plugin later down the line that doesnt exist for Gulp since Gulp is smallernot as wellsupported as Grunt.p  pIs there anything that Ive missed so far in my research Any further suggestions Im not terribly experienced so any sage advice Stackoverflow has to offer would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 77497 pIm using Google Sites to build a website that is largely a frontend for Google Drive folders. Id like the site to embed some of these folders, but Im unhappy with the way Google Sites seems to handle subfolders whether I set up the drive folder as an iframe or with the builtin gadget, subfolders will open up a new tab, rather than display the contents of the subfolder within the iframe. p  pFurthermore, this new tab will always display the contents of this subfolder in grid view, while list view would make much more sense for the kind of data involved. And it opens up the new folder as a grid, even if the gadget is set to display folder contents as a list. Any thoughts on how to change either of thesep

Negative 77497 pThis is my problem statement  p  pI have a couple of columns that will be created dynamically. The last column will be a Total column and the last row will be a Total row. So if any cell is edited, I need the Total column and row to be updated. I added the CalculatedColumn dynamically in the code. It does load up the data by applying the expression, but on edit of a cell, nothing modifies.p  pHere are my questions   1 Is the code written right 2 Does it need changes, Ive only been into Telerik for 2 days and am trying to get this work so I may have got the code all wrong.  3 Can the CalculatedColumn refresh on cell editupdate 4 If not, then can I update the rows and columns in javascript How do I do this I tried getting the cell value, but am unable to apply the modified value to the last column.p  pI think Ive summed up all my issues.

Negative 77497 pIn a project Im doing I have a set of JTextPanes wrapped in JPanels inside a JFrame. The JTextPanes can be various sizes when the programming is actually running, and what size they will be cannot be predicted, unless it is hardcoded. To make sure that all of the JTextPanes which are inside the JPanels are viewable, I have put everything in a scroll pane. Heres the catch strongI want the JTextPanes to extend past the bottom of the JScrollPane if needed, but I dont want them to extend past the side.strong I also want the JPanelsJTextPanes to take up as much space as possible horizontal, without requiring the use of a horizontal scroll bar. This means that if the window is resized horizontally, the JTextPanes need to resize to fill the horizontal space. The JTextPanes are wrapped first in a panel that uses the GroupLayout supplied with the Netbeans GUI builder, and then in a panel that uses a BoxLayout. The reason it is BoxLayout is that I add new elements JTextPanes wrapped in a panel, to it via code. It is much easier to do this using BoxLayout. p  pI tried setting the prefferred width of the JTextPanes to codeInteger.MAXVALUEcode, but that just caused them to extend out of site to the right. I then tried disabling, the horizontal scrollbar, but the JTextPanes still extended to the right. Now I couldnt even scroll to see them Finally I tried using an event to  catch whenever the JFrame resized, then I would call methods to cause everything in the tree to resize. But this didnt seem to work at all. I did this by trying to set the preferred width of each JTextPane to the preferred width of the JFrame, but it didnt seem to have any effect.p  pHeres what it looks like if I have the width of the inner JTextPane set to code427code img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxcqui.png altenter image description herep  pHeres what I have if I leave the JTextPanes size at Default which I believe is codeInteger.MAXVALUEcode img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comEuxpW.png altenter image description herep  pIn case it matters, Im using the Netbeans GUI builder Matisse, so Id prefer a solution that didnt involve changing the layout manager, but I would be open to that. Note that as I said above, the BoxLayout is used in some of the panels, its actually part of the issue.p

Negative 77497 pId like to record some mouse interaction with a web page, or more specifically, with a canvas element on that web page. So interacting with various web elements will be of little use, and instead interacting with the canvas with fine position control is essential.p  pFor a while I was looking at the a hrefhttpselenium.googlecode.comgitdocsapijavaindex.htmlorgopenqaseleniuminteractionsMouse.html relnofollowcodeMousecodea interface. I was somewhat surprised that I could provide offset for movement, but not for codemouseDowncode and codemouseUpcode. It also took me a while to figure out that I can probably turn a a hrefhttpselenium.googlecode.comgitdocsapijavaindex.htmlorgopenqaseleniumWebElement.html relnofollowcodeWebElementcodea into a hrefhttpselenium.googlecode.comgitdocsapijavaindex.htmlorgopenqaseleniuminteractionsinternalCoordinates.html relnofollowcodeCoordinatescodea by casting it to the a hrefhttpselenium.googlecode.comgitdocsapijavaindex.htmlorgopenqaseleniuminternalLocatable.html relnofollowcodeLocatablecodea interface first.p  pBut codeLocatablecode and codeCoordinatescode are in a package called codeinternalcode. Eventually with the help of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq97357191468366this questiona I learned about a hrefhttpselenium.googlecode.comgitdocsapijavaindex.htmlorgopenqaseleniuminteractionsActions.html relnofollowcodeActionscodea. Its documentation statesp  blockquote   pThe userfacing API for emulating complex user gestures. Use this class rather than using the Keyboard or Mouse directly.p blockquote  pSo it seems that I should be using this. Expressing my movement in that context seems easy enough. But what has me worried is timing. Id like to move objects approximately at the same speed I used when recording. Im not aiming to exactly reproduce timing, but some mouse actions will trigger computations in a timer step, so the interaction between mouse events and timer should be simulated in a natural fashion.p  pI see no codewaitcode or codesleepcode method in codeActionscode. What I do see is a codepausecode method, but that has been deprecated. The deprecation message readsp  blockquote   pPause is considered to be a bad design practice.p blockquote  pThe a hrefhttpscode.google.compseleniumsourcedetailra7d53122fd86ea268078fbd125bcaa45ab124f57 relnofollowcommita adding that deprecation has no more detail either.p  ul liWhy is codepausecode considered bad designli liCan I expect drivers to support this command despite the deprecationli liDo I have to fear that this command will vanish soonli liHow else should I implement timing of mouse movementli ul  pThere appears to be plenty of places where some form of waiting can be realized. a hrefhttpselenium.googlecode.comgitdocsapijavaindex.htmlorgopenqaseleniumsupportuiWebDriverWait.html relnofollowcodeWebDriverWaitcodea and a hrefhttpselenium.googlecode.comgitdocsapijavaindex.htmlorgopenqaseleniumWebDriver.Timeouts.html relnofollowcodeWebDriver.Timeoutscodea seem the most likely candidates. But would it really be preferable to perform codeActionscode consisting of a single mouse move, and interleave them with waits Particularly if I might be remote controlling some machine over a slow link Interleaving codepausecode statements in a long codeActionscode sequence seemed so much more reasonable to me.p  pemEdit 1em Looking at a hrefhttpscode.google.compseleniumsourcebrowsejavaclientsrcorgopenqaseleniuminteractionsPauseAction.java relnofollowthe sourcesa I see that codeActions.pausecode is simply implemented using codeThread.sleepcode. So the delay is only local, and network latency over a bad link might severely distort timing. I also found two bug reports regarding codeActions.pausecode, a hrefhttpscode.google.compseleniumissuesdetailid7424 relnofollowonea requesting that it not be deprecated and a hrefhttpscode.google.compseleniumissuesdetailid7646 relnofollowanothera reuqesting an alternative. The latter comes with a proofofconcept implementation building on codeWebDriverWaitcode. But looking at that, it bases its timing on codeClockcode and the only implementation of that interface is codeSystemClockcode so it appears that again all timing is controlled clientside. What wed need would be some onthewire command for a serverside delay, I think.p
Negative 77497 pIve written an API that updates multiple things asynchronously on my server via an HTTP POST.  I want to be able to send multiple results back one for each thing updated to the client using emserversent eventsem and then close the stream from the server.p  pIs there a way to make the client use an HTTP POST rather than a GET when setting up the codeEventSourcecodep  pIt occurs to me now that multiple POSTS rather than a single POST with multiple items might be a simplerthough presumably less performantoption, so doing some refactoring is an acceptable alternative, but if I could avoid that option, it would save me some time.p

Negative 77497 pI have written a web application using Entity Framework to perform CRUD operations on the database.p  pI want to change this so that Stored Procedures will be used for the CUD operations. Although Ive used Stored Procedures extensively in other projects after reading around, I can see that there is a school of thought where Stored Procedures should not contain any business logic which I had been doing previously.p  pHas anyone taken this approach when building applications with Stored Procs and does this approach work Assuming this approach is the correct, then Im assuming that Stored Procs should only do basic CRUD operationsp  pAlso  My web application is a password sharing system, that allows admins to give individual users access to individual passwords. So when a password is created, the Stored Proc would write the password to the database, Administrators need to automatically be given access to the password... so taking the leave business logic out of SPs approach, should the AddPassword SP contain some logic to create the relevant records for the admins to have access, or should this be done through a loop calling an AddAccess SPp

Negative 77497 pHow suitable is PyMC in its currently available versions for modelling continuous emission HMMs p  pI am interested in having a framework where I can easily explore model variations, without having to update E and Mstep, and dynamic programming recursions for every change I make to the model. p  pMore specific questions arep  ul liWhen modelling an HMM in PyMC can I answer the typical tasks that one would like to solve  i.e., besides parameter estimation also infer the most likely sequence as usually done with the Viterbi algorithm, or solve a smoothing problemli liAs compared to an implementation with Expectation Maximization, I would expect a sampling based approach to be slower. If that gives me more flexibility on the model building side, that is fine. I would imagine using PyMC for prototyping models. I am wondering though, if I can expect PyMC to handle inference for models with  10k observations to finish in any reasonable amount of time. li liWould you recommend starting out with PyMC2 or PyMC3 for model building. I know that the inference engine changed between the version, so I would especially wonder what type of sampler might be more suited.li ul  pIf yould think PyMC is not a good choice for my use case, that definitely helps as an answer as well.p

Negative 77497 pI am a 4th year student studying Electrical Engineering. Im doing a project for my final year about car security and a protection system. The first part of my project is to track stolen vehicle and send location update to owners phone. Im using GPSGPRSGSM Module Shield V3.0 and Arduino Uno for this. The first part is almost done.p  pSecond part of my project is to alert the drivers near ones after an accident is occurred. Im using pressure sensor and vibration sensor to detect the accident. I know it can be done by sending a text to the relatives from the GSM modem when an accident has occurred, but I was wondering if I can post an automatic Facebook status stating the time and location so the driver and car can be found easily. I cannot figure out how to get this part done or write the code. How do I get access to users Facebook account I am using C programming btw.p  pCan anyone explain me how can I accomplish it Or, if you can name any other tutorial or forum discussion, that will be very helpful too. p

Negative 77497 pI am developing an offline web app, using HTML5 and JavaScript, that is a wizard users can download and work through to create a zip with a few files  and the form data they can send to us to see if they are ready for our services. The user needs to exit and resume later without loss of data already input. I am using LocalStorage for the persistence of the form data, and zip.js to create the zip at the end. p  pWhat I need to know is how I can have the user select filesmostly screen shots but there is a 35 MB file they must upload as well throughout the wizard and not lose the files selected if they exit and resume later. I could have them create a directory, and have them select the files and then save them into the new directory that will just be zipped at the end, but am unsure how to do that since everything is being done locally on their computer.p

Negative 77497 pThis will be a bit of a lengthly post, sorry in advance. I have a bit of experience using MongoDB been awhile and Im soso with python, but I have a big project and I would like some feedback before spending lots of time coding.p  pThe project involves creating a gallery where individual presentation slides from apple keynote 09 can be selected and parsed together into a presentation. This way a user with a few thousand slides can use this program to create a new presentation by mixing and matching old slides, rather than having to open up each presentation and copypaste all of the desired slides into a new presentation manually.p  pWithin the program there is a master gallery that contains all the slides. Each slide may be selected and assigned searchable tags. New groups of slides may be formed, where all slides with a specific set of tags are added to the group automatically. In addition, individual slides can be dragged from the master gallery and dropped into a usercreated group.p  pThere is a folder with preview images for each slide, here is why I believe I need MongoDB By having a database where each slide is a document that contains the filename of the slide, the filename of the preview thumbnail of the slide, and an array containing searchable tag words, one will be able to query specific sets of slides very quickly. The query will return an array of matching slides which can than be looped through to add each slide thumbnail to the GUI gallery. The usercreated groups can be individual collections, where a collection is created when a group is created, slides are addedremoved from the collection as needed, and the collection can be destroyed when the group is deleted. This also will allow permanent storage as the database and its collections will persist between opening and closing the program.p  pMy question is, will I be able to use MongoDB through pyMongo to do the following with decent performancep  pCreate and delete collections as needed Copy and delete specific documents from a master collection into newly created collections Store an array of searchable tags in string format in a dynamic array associated with each document Query slides within a collection based on a single tag word stored in an array within each document Maintain the database between system shutdowns and opening  closing the program.p  pThanksp

Negative 77497 pstrongWhat the code doesstrong I am writing a class to create a binary tree of possible moves from a specified state. During the constructor of the binary tree I pass in a 2D enumerable array Player 1, Player 2 or neutral representing what cells are available and what cells have been claimed. Then the constructor iterates through the board and for every empty cell a recursive call is made stopping when there is a winner or there are no moves left.p  pstrongWhere it goes wrongstrong During debugging I added a toString call on line 16 to see the status of the board. I have found that the program does as intended until the first game is won. It successfully realises it has reached the point of simplicity and SHOULD move up one layer and follow the next branch of the tree Basically depth first search but it crashes with a Null Pointer Exception.p  pstrongWhat I think is happeningstrong When the program steps up one layer in the branch and I look at the state of the board it still has the same state of when it won. I think that because arrays of enums are treated like objects in java and thus they are being passed by reference.

So the data looks likep  precodetimestamp, station1, station2, ... 19000101 000000, 80, 60, 81, ... 19000101 010000, 82, 59, 83 codepre  pIm looking for a clustering algorithm that group weather stations together so in a cluster the station temperatures are very strongclosestrong. For example, 80 and 81 are close, while 80 and 60 are not.p  pPlus, if the algorithm can also tellcalculate how close is the data point to the cluster center, that will be great...p

Negative 77497 pIve a problem trying to pass a vector of Struct in a function. If I pass it normally, without amp, all the edits done inside the function are lost outside of it.

Also, correct me if I am wrong, isnt the case of insertion the same as the case of the deletion I mean, instead of deleting a character from one string, we could insert the same character in the second string, and the opposite. So why not merge the insertdelete operations into one operation with cost equal to codemincostinsert, costdeletecodep

Negative 77497 pI have successfully implemented codeKVOcode between my data singleton and my UITableView. It is observing a codepropertycode. The tableview correctly adds, removes and updates rows.p  pI recently added sections to my table based on a category for each item in the array. The tableview loads properly, I have an array of sections and then my code loops through the codeKVOcode property to populate those sections.p  pHowever, whenever I edit one of those rows and it moves into a different section, the app crashes complaining that I have an invalid number of rows in section X.p  pIs there additional logic needed for codeKVOcode to properly manage changing section lengths and rows My fairly generic codeobserveValueForKeyPathcode method is below. I tried adding methods for insertSections, deleteSections, and reloadSections in the switch statement but that did not help. Any advice appreciated.p  pMy section is always 0 as I make codeNSIndexPathcodes, however I cant figure out how to determine the new section with the methods arguments.p  precode voidobserveValueForKeyPathNSString keyPath ofObjectidobject changeNSDictionary change contextvoid context       if object  [DataStore sharedInstance] ampamp [keyPath isEqualToStringkPropertyObserved]          NSKeyValueChange kindOfChange  [change[NSKeyValueChangeKindKey] unsignedIntegerValue]         if kindOfChange  NSKeyValueChangeSetting              [self.tableView reloadData]          else if kindOfChange  NSKeyValueChangeInsertion                     kindOfChange  NSKeyValueChangeRemoval                     kindOfChange  NSKeyValueChangeReplacement              NSIndexSet indexSetOfChanges  change[NSKeyValueChangeIndexesKey]             NSMutableArray indexPathsThatChanged  [NSMutableArray new]             [indexSetOfChanges enumerateIndexesUsingBlockNSUInteger idx, BOOL stop                  NSIndexPath newIndexPath  [NSIndexPath indexPathForItemidx inSection0]                 [indexPathsThatChanged addObjectnewIndexPath]             ]              [self.tableView beginUpdates]             switch kindOfChange                  case NSKeyValueChangeInsertion                     [self.tableView insertRowsAtIndexPathsindexPathsThatChanged withRowAnimationUITableViewRowAnimationAutomatic]                     break                 case NSKeyValueChangeRemoval                     [self.tableView deleteRowsAtIndexPathsindexPathsThatChanged withRowAnimationUITableViewRowAnimationAutomatic]                     break                 case NSKeyValueChangeReplacement                     [self.tableView reloadRowsAtIndexPathsindexPathsThatChanged withRowAnimationUITableViewRowAnimationAutomatic]                     break                 default                     break                          [self.tableView endUpdates]                codepre

Negative 77497 pI am not able to disclose very much information, but our software is in the healthcare industry on the practice side. My company is building a new web based product, in which our users will be able access and run reports. We are working to make it a single page dashboard interface where they can select a report from one of the 100 reports that we have available in our other product. p  pAdvice that I need is in how to generate the reports. We would like to avoid having to create separate forms for each report, and instead have a way to use the fields in the report to generate the form. My thoughts are that we should be able to build a framework for this that would make everything simpler.p  pI apologize in advance for how convoluted this explanation is. Any advice is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 77497 pI have written a simple binary tree using structures and a couple of functions in order to add, search, find the minimum and maximum values, remove a node as well as destroy the node, the problem is that I have been using recursion and dealing with it in the same way and I am having a hard time trying to comprehend if my function for sorting the algorithm is efficient enough.p  pThe whole code isp  precodeincludeltiostreamgt using namespace std     This is a very simple example demonstrating a very basic binary tree to be    implemented using structurs, later on I would like to create this by using   classes, but for now, structures and pointers would suffice       The node is created in here, notice how the pointer has the ability to    self reference to 2 different positions, this means that there is the ability   to store to 2 different branches of memory      struct node   int keyvalue   node  pleft   node  pright        This is the creation of the add function that will add to the linked list      node addnode  ptree, int key    The base case of the recursive function will be placed in here   since binary trees are recursive in nature and linked data structures   are as a whole in terms of space and memory, the recursive function will   suffice for most cases involving binary trees.   In this case, if the given parameter is null, we create the tree   by allocating the necessary memory space   if ptree  NULL      node  pnewtree  new node     pnewtreegtpleft  NULL     pnewtreegtpright  NULL     pnewtreegtkeyvalue  key     return pnewtree    end of base case    Depending of the value of the node, we determine if we will add to the left side or the right side of the subtree   if key lt ptreegtkeyvalue      if it is less than the value, we add to the left     ptreegtpleft  insertptreegtpleft, key      else     ptreegtpright  insertptreegtpright, key      return ptree   end of function          This is where the search function will be created   in here the function will go over all the subtrees untill the one with the necessary key is returned   again, this uses recursive functions doing things step by step      First Look to see if the given tree node is emptyNULL if yes then return NULL      Second If we find the key by referencing the key value, then we are done and return that particular tree     Third Otherwise, look into the left and right sides of the tree making recursive calls to this very same function until          the one that we are looking for is found.        node searchnode ptree, key    First   if ptree  NULL  return NULL     Second   else if ptreegtkeyvalue  key  return ptree     Third   else ifkey lt ptreegtkeyvalue      searchptreegtpleft, key Thus it looks into the left with the same recursive algorithm      else      searchptreegtpright, key    End of recursive search function       Easiest function to implement, since the delete key is used being that the whole concept falls inside memory being allocated to the   list via the creation of new nodesthis means using the new keyword to allocate memory, much like creating new objects in other languages     First Check to see if passed tree is not null, if not null destroy the left and right subtree using the same function          else nothing.      NOTE The return value is set to void since it returns nothing back to the list     void destroynodenode ptree    First   if ptree  NULL      destroyptreegtpleft     destroyptreegtpright     cout ltlt endl     cout ltlt Destroying left subtree node ltlt endl     cout ltlt Destroying right subtree node ltlt endl     cout ltlt Deleting the entire node  ltlt ptreegtkeyvalue ltlt endl     cout ltlt endl     delete ptree    End of recursive destroy function         Finding the max value is simple, we evaluate the left and right node and use base cases to see which node to return   Why just right   looking back at the theory behind binary trees, the tree on the right is always the biggest element. That is how trees are normally sorted.   there is no need to look at the keys, the code will sort out by itself in this space since if it is not null it will return the highest.   node returnmaxnode ptree    if ptree  NULL      return NULL      if ptreegtpright  NULL      return ptree      return returnmaxptreegtpright  End of return max recursive function        Max node, basically the opposite of the avobe taking advantage of the fact that the left node is lesser   recursion will be used again      node returnminnode ptree   if ptree  NULL      return NULL      ifptreegtpleft  NULL      return ptree      return returnminptreegtpleft End of recursive return min function       We need a remove max function in order to properly remove the biggest node in case it is found, that way we can implement a recursive   algorithm inside the  function in charge of removing the node we want, we can simply remove the node by using delete or destroy once we   find it because that would only destroy the entire tree No no, that is not good.     node removemaxnodenode ptree, node pmaxnode    if ptree  NULL  return NULL    if ptree  pmaxnode      return pmaxnodegtpleft Because the left one is lesser      Now for the recursive call, implementing this means that we will remove from the node on the right   basing us on the sense that the right tree is the highest one, it will go then from top to bottom   ptreegtpright  removemaxnodeptreegtpright, pmaxnode   return the tree after the changes in the addresses have been conducted properly   return ptree                   Removing from a tree is also simple based on the recursive nature of the element being discussed     First Check to see if the tree is null, if yess, return null     node removeNnode ptree, int key    First   if ptree  NULL  return NULL   Second   ifptreegtkeyvalue  key      Third     if ptreegtpleft  NULL        node prightsub  ptreegtpright       delete ptree       return prightsub          if ptreegtpright  NULL        node pleftsub  ptreegtpleft       delete ptree       return pleftsub           node pmaxN  returnmaxptreegtpleft     pmaxNgtpleft  removemaxnodeptreegtpleft, pmaxnode     pmaxNgtpright  ptreegtpright     delete ptee     return pmaxnode      else ifkey lt ptreegtkeyvalue      ptreegtpleft  removeNptreegtpleft, key      else      ptreegtpright  removeNptreegtpright, key      After all  changes have been done   return ptree        The entire implementation is sorted when calling return min and max         node sortedNnode ptree   if ptree  NULLreturn NULL    return sortedNreturnmaxptree        int mainint argv, char []    cout ltlt This is merely a test ltlt endl   return 0  codepre  pMy understanding is that the way I defined the other functions originally already sort and return the state of the node itself in a new way being that I am using pointers. Maybe I am wrong to think that my sorting function works. I have been with this all day and cannot think of a better way, most of my code was written for the understanding I have in it and the help of my books, my instructor is not being much help as well so I came here seeking some wisdom.p
Negative 77497 pIve been spending the last few hours googling for an answer and Im beginning to think Im the only human being on Earth having to cope with this problem. So Ill ask my first ever question on Stack Overflow.p  pWe are building a large solution for one of our customer using Microsoft Dynamics 4. Im in charge of SSRS reports and Im using Visual Studio 2005 to build my reports, which I then upload with the crms UI.p  pEverything works fine, really, except this one little thing when using prefiltering eg. CRMAFemSomeEntityem, Id like to removedisable the default filter Modified in the last 30 days without having to go in the UI and delete it. p  pI want this because everytime I add a new report or modify one. Or worst, everytime code is migrated to a new environment we have to delete the default filter for 27 reports more to come, one by one. But I still want prefiltering to work using CRMAFemSomeEntityem.p  pThere must be some setting somewhere where we can configure this option. But I cant find anything.p  pThank you.p
