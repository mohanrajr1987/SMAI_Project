Positive 27969 pId like to know what the advantages are of using kombu to manage messaging and queuing for a RabbitMQ server and some python apps. Is it just that one can swap out the amqp implementation later or is there more to it than that Does kombu replace the need for pika with something that is not tied to RabbitMQ specifically I know that sometimes well use Celery, and sometimes well want to use RabbitMQ directly without Celery and am not clear on how best to go about this in 2015.  p
Positive 27969 pI processed 50 data. The consuming from one queue to database is processed well. If the RabbitMQ is went down. The data processing stopped.

Positive 27969 pIm evaluating celery for my task queuing workflow. My requirements are slightly unique. The system has the notion of projects and each project will have a potentially large number of tasks associated with it. I would like the queuing system to dispatch these tasks in a fair way in that one project with very many tasks to process will not starve other projects.p  pFor example, say that ProjectA has 100 tasks associated with it and all of those tasks are submitted simultaneously. The first 5 tasks are pulled off and submitted to the 5 workers. While the first 5 tasks are processing ProjectB is submitted with another 100 tasks. ProjectB should not have to wait for ProjectA to complete all 100 of its tasks in order to get some processing time. Instead, once a worker becomes free, it should process a ProjectB task. Then the next worker to become free should process a ProjectA task, and so forth in a roundrobin fashion.p  pMy thought was that I could dynamically create new queues for each project and have all the workers pull from all the queues such as described in a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions18730710createdynamicqueueswithcelerythis SO posta. However, according to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma14768923458310this answera celery workers will actually process tasks in the order they were submitted, regardless of the queue they are in which seems a little peculiar too me. This does not work for me because it would cause starvation of projects submitted after the currently processing one.p  pCan Celery be used to implement my requirements If not, is there a recommended best practice to implement my requirementsp

Positive 27969 pIm trying to evaluate different pubsub messaging protocols on their ability to horizontally scale without producing unnecessary cross chatter.p  pMy architecture will have NodeJS servers with web socket clients connected. I plan on using a consistent hashing based router to direct clients to servers based off of the topics theyre interested in subscribing to. This would mean that for a given topic, only a subset of servers will have clients subscribing to that topic. Messages will then be published to a pubsub broker, which would be responsible for fanning out that data to servers that have subscribers.p  pThe situation I want to avoid is one in which every broker receives every request, and the network becomes saturated. This is a clear issue with scaling Redis PubSub. a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiBC3BCchi27sproblem relnofollowAdding servers shouldnt create an n squares problema.p  pThe number of clients on the pubsub protocol would be the number of servers. Ideally, each server would be able to have a local broker to fan out data efficiently to multiple NodeJS processes, as to avoid unnecessary network bandwidth. In most cases, for a given topic, all subscribers would be on that same server.p  pWhat pubsub protocols offer this sort of topic based data propagationp  pThe protocols Im evaluating are MQTT, RabbitMQ, ZMQ, nanomsg. This isnt inclusive, and SAAS options are acceptable.p  pThe quality assurance constraints are easy. At most once, or at least once are both adequate. Acknowledgment isnt important. Event order isnt important. Were looking for fire and forget, with an emphasis on horizontal scalability.p

Positive 27969 pI want to create small app which will receive data from RabbitMQ server using python pika and than process this data cut unnecessary data, create simpler notification and send it to socket.io server.

Positive 27969 pIm learning about queuing, and RabbitMq, in particular.  Ive followed tutorial a hrefhttpswww.rabbitmq.comtutorialstutorialtwojava.html relnofollowherea, but I dont feel as though they cover real world examples very well.p  pWhat Id like to see is how the queue is used practically.  Each of the tutorials decalres a producer and then immediately after, a consumer.  I would like to set the consumer on autopilot... that is, any task that the producer adds, should be picked up automatically by the consumer.  The consumer would then do whatever it needed to do with the data.p  pIve seen this pattern of explaining it, using main method, over and over again left out the detailsp  pTaskp  precodepublic class NewTask     public static void mainString[] argv                        throws java.io.IOException  ...      channel.basicPublish , TASKQUEUENAME,              MessageProperties.PERSISTENTTEXTPLAIN,             message.getBytes     System.out.println [x] Sent   message    ...  codepre  pWorkerp  precodepublic class Worker     public static void mainString[] argv throws Exception   ...      final Consumer consumer  new DefaultConsumerchannel        Override       public void handleDeliveryString consumerTag, Envelope envelope, AMQP.BasicProperties properties, byte[] body throws IOException          System.out.println [x] Received   message   ...                 channel.basicConsumeTASKQUEUENAME, false, consumer    codepre  p...But what Im trying to do is set up the consumer to just do its job, kind of like what a scheduled job would do if I were using Quartz, but without a schedule.  Just pick the messages up as they come in.p

Positive 27969 pI have a restful service written in Java using the Jersey Framework that implements an Advanced Message Queuing Protocol on top of a RabbitMQ server. p  pWhen a consumer gets a message from a given channel he is given a delivery tag. This delivery tag is used in a separate rest call to acknowledge receipt of the message and remove it from the queue entirely. However, since each channel has its own set of delivery tags starting with tag id 1, the acknowledgement request must know which channel to send the acknowledgement back to, otherwise we get an unknown delivery tag exception.p  pOne way I have thought of tracking this is by using some kind of dictionary that stores a generated GUID as the key and stores the channel and delivery tag id as the value. I could pass the GUID to the consumer on a consume call, store the GUID with its associated channel and delivery tag in the dictionary, and then when the ack call comes back with the GUID, I could then look up the proper channel and delivery tag and ack it. p  pThere is one problem with this method though, the restful java application that is running on top of the single running RabbitMQ server must run in a load balanced environment, which means a consume request could come in and hit one running instance of the application and store the channeldelivery tag in its local dictionary. Then when it calls to ack that message it could hit another running instance of the application, which would have a different set of GUIDs in its local dictionary and thus would not be able to look up the necessary channeldelivery tag needed to ack. p  pOf course I could store the channeldelivery tag info in an external database, but that would kind of defeat the purpose of using a queue in the first place.p  pHow would you have a restful RabbitMQ service that requires acknowledging messages, can be load balanced, and has one channel per thread, if you have to send the acknowledgment on the same channel you consumed fromp

Positive 27969 pWorking on a C project that uses Rabbit. Ive found what appears to me as conflicting information in the documentation regarding when a message is redelivered as a result of either a connection or channel dying which one is itp  pThe docs here a hrefhttpwww.rabbitmq.comsemantics.html relnofollowhttpwww.rabbitmq.comsemantics.htmlap  pState that it is requeued for delivery when a channel closesp  blockquote   pMessages can be returned to the queue using AMQP methods that feature   a requeue parameter basic.recover, basic.reject and basic.nack, strongor   due to a channel closingstrong while holding unacknowledged messages. Any of   these scenarios caused messages to be requeued at the back of the   queue for RabbitMQ releases earlier than 2.7.0. From RabbitMQ release   2.7.0, messages are always held in the queue in publication order, even in the presence of requeueing or channel closure.p blockquote  pBut here a hrefhttpwww.rabbitmq.comtutorialstutorialtwodotnet.html relnofollowhttpwww.rabbitmq.comtutorialstutorialtwodotnet.htmlap  pStates Only when the worker connection diesp  blockquote   pIf a consumer dies without sending an ack, RabbitMQ will understand   that a message wasnt processed fully and will redeliver it to another   consumer. That way you can be sure that no message is lost, even if   the workers occasionally die.p      pThere arent any message timeouts RabbitMQ will redeliver the message   strongonly when the worker connection diesstrong. Its fine even if processing a   message takes a very, very long time.p blockquote  pSo when does redelivery actually happen When the worker or the channel dies Can I strongConsumestrong on one channel but strongACKstrong on another channelp  pCurrently I created a ChannelManager class that opens N channels and stores them in a ConcurrentQueue and Queues  Dequeues Channels as they are needed, and also ensures we never fall below the minimum available channel count. With this method there is no way for me to ensure the Consume and Ack happen on the same channel...p

Works fine so far, however when a create a copy of the resx file, say codeMyTemplates.de.resxcode, and open codeSomeEmailTemplate.txtcode from there, it will open emalways the same fileem.

For the batch job, it must have one transaction for each user, so that if something fails during this method, the transaction is rolled back.

Negative 27969 pI have integer values ranging from 328191 which I want to map to a roughly logarithmic scale. If I were using base 2, I could just count the leading zero bits and map them into 8 slots, but this is too coursegrained I need 32 slots and more would be better, but I need them to map to bits in a 32bit value, which comes out to a base of roughly 1.181.20 for the logarithm. Anyone have some tricks for computing this value, or a reasonable approximation, very fastp  pMy intuition is to break the range down into 2 or 3 subranges with conditionals, and use a small lookup table for each, but I wonder if theres some trick I could do with countleadingzeros then refining the result, especially since the results dont have to be exact but just roughly logarithmic.p

It matches with the exact same sort I did on paper, except that the order of pairs of numbers JS chooses from the array to sort are somewhat unpredictable, so it actually does more comparisons then I needed to do, but I guess its because I can think about results ahead of time and choose pairs of numbers as I want very uncomputerlike.p  pIn this test I did it in six calculation, JS did it in ten, which, in fairness is more thorough.p  pArray  2,16,7,3,10p  p2  16  14 lt0     2,16,7,3,10p  p16  7  9 0       2,7,16,3,10p  p16  3  13 0      2,7,3,16,10p  p16  10  6 0       2,7,3,10,16p  p2  7  5 lt0       2,7,3,10,16p  p7  3  4 0        2,3,7,10,16p  pArray  2,3,7,10,16p  pNot sure if this is, strictly speaking, a quick sort, since the quick sort uses a pivot number and uses it as a centre point around which to divide the array in the sort. But this is my understanding of how JS is doing it. Correct me if Im wrong. p
Negative 27969 pI was thinking about security for my REST web Service API, and decided to take a look at others large services and how they do it. As an example I decided to study Twitters OAuth. After reading beginners guide Im a little be confused and shocked.p  pAs I understood its Service provider responsibility to authenticate user and to show User what kind of access consumer is demanding for example it wants read only access to specific resource. But I saw service providers that doesnt inform user on what type of access consumer is demanding and even now showing consumers identity. The second part of problem is that consumer can show his own custom Provider Service Authentication form in IFrame, and just hide access details, they can just steal you password, or request unlimited access to you resources, they can do basically what ever they want, there are lots of way to trick user.p  pAs an example lets take a LinkedIn. They request your gmail username and password inside their own form, and you have no idea how they will use it. They can just steal it and store in their DB, they can OAuth with it to gmail and they dont show gmails page with information what type of access they request, they can do whatever they want with this information.p  pWhat Im trying to say is not that OAuth communication protocol is not secure, but rather there are lots of way to use it improperly to trick the user and get his credentials. p  pBTW there were security flow in OAuth protocol itself a hrefhttpoauth.netadvisories20091httpoauth.netadvisories20091a and Im pretty sure there are more, but no one cares to find them.p

Then count how many other rows in the CATEGORIES table have the same parent . Then create a loop to pull the subcategories for as many times as there were parents and store their names in an array. Once done, loop through and print the array.p  precoderow[cat] is equal to the cat column of classifieds     if there is at least 1 record in classifieds, process it   if rows gt 0    cat  row[cat]   querya  SELECT  FROM categories WHERE id  cat limit 1   resulta  mysqlqueryquerya       while rowa  mysqlfetcharrayresulta, MYSQLASSOC            catname  rowa[name]           catsub  rowa[sub]           catparent  rowa[parent]          count how many other rows have the same parent   queryparent  SELECT  FROM categories WHERE parent  catparent   pullparent  mysqlqueryqueryparent   parents  mysqlnumrowspullparent   codepre  pstrongOLD FOR LOOPstrongbr      pull subparent recordsbr     if catsub  1 br         nbspnbspnbspnbspfor i  0 i lt parents ibr             nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspqueryc  SELECT  FROM categories WHERE id  catsubbr            nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspsubcat2  mysqlqueryquerycbr            nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp while row3  mysqlfetcharraysubcat2, MYSQLASSOC br           nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspbreadc[]  row3[name]br nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspbreadsub  row3[sub]br nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspcatsub  breadsubbr nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp         p  precode   else    codepre  pstrongCORRECT FOR LOOPstrongbr if catsub  0 br nbspnbspnbspnbspfor i0 i lt parents i   p  pnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspqueryc  mysqlquerySELECT  FROM categories WHERE id  catsub ORDER BY id ASCbr nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbsprow3[i]  mysqlfetcharrayqueryc, MYSQLASSOCbr nbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspcatsub  row3[i][sub]  p  pnbspnbspnbspnbspbr br else  p  precodeforeach breadc as crumb        echo crumb .  gt     codepre  pThe foreach echo above prints the trailbackwards butproperly as Ford  Muscle Cars  Cars, but it only does it for the first record in the CLASSIFIEDS table.

Negative 27969 pI have inherited a VERY poorly designed and maintained database and have been using my knowledge of SQL Server and a little luck keeping this HIGH availability server up and not completing coming down in flames the previous developer, who quit basically just kept the system up for 4 years.p  pI have come across a very strange problem today.  I hope someone can explain this to me so if this happens again there is a way to fix it.p  pAnyway, there is a stored proc that is pretty simple.  It joins two tables together between a SHORT datetime range 5 mins range and passes back the results this query runs every 5 mins via a windows service.  The largest table has 100k rows, the smallest table has 10k rows.  The stored proc is very simple and doesp  pNOTEThe table and columns names have been changed to protect the innocent.p  precodeSELECT TOP 100 m. FROM dbo.mytable1 m WITH nolock INNER JOIN dbo.mytable2 s WITH nolock ON m.Table2ID  s.Table2ID WHERE m.RowActive  1       AND s.DateStarted lt DATEADDminute, 5, getdate ORDER BY m.DateStarted codepre  pNow, if I keep TOP 100 in the query, the query hangs until I stop it running in SMS or in the stored proc.  If I remove the TOP 100, the query works as planned and returns 50ish rows, like it should we dont want it to return more than 100 rows if we can help it.p  pSo, I did some investigating, using spwho, spwho2, and looked at the master..sysprocesses and used DBCC INPUTBUFFER to look for any SPIDs that might be locking or blocking.  No blocks and no locking.p  pThis JUST STARTED today with no changes to these these two tables designs and from what I gather the last time this querytables have been touched was 3 years ago and has been running without error since.p  pNow, a side note, and I dont know if this would have anything to do with this.  But I reindexed both these tables about 24 hours before because they were 99 fragmented remember, I said this was poorly designed and poorly maintained server.p  pCan anyone explain why SQL Server 2008 would do thisp

Negative 27969 pI developed some components with their own codeOnPaintcodeoverride where I draw them.p  pI now added a status panel which is designed to overlap topmost with part of my form. I use a alphablended color to emgray outem the underlying controls and display a text on it.p  pUnfortunately some of my underlying custom controls paint themselves after the status bar and so draw themselves above the status bar. Debugging I found out that first the status bar on paint event was called, later the paint event of the underlying controls.p  pHow can I make sure the proper order is used to paintp  pWhen underlying components draw themselves the components infront of them should always be automatically invalidate so they redraw themselves but that is not happing. I also called codeSendToFrontcode on the statusbar but that did not helper neither. So I am also asking what is the proper mechanism to maintain the order and how do the core components handle that.p  pstrongEditstrong I also run in this problem With every run of my codeOnPaintcodeevent my overlay gets more and more opaque because it draws with emalpha128redem again and again on itself.p

Negative 27969 pcreating a parent project with only a pom.xml, and lots of sub projects such as myweb mycore mybackofficep  petc. is easy, and the sonotype eclipse plugin does most of the work.p  pHowever, getting one project to know about the source in the other project seems to be hard.  E.g. when you are debugging the myweb project, and step into mycore, eclipse doesnt know where to get the source.p  pLooking in the Java Build Path in eclipse, the maven plugin has added mycore as a folder under Web App Libraries.  I.e. its not using the mycore0.0.1.SNAPSHOT.jar or similar, its using the raw java files.  Great p  pBut how to tell maven to tell eclipse to look for the source in the same placep  pIm not really sure where to start.   Im guessing its possible to get maven to put the source in a special jar using the mavensoureplugin, but this will usually be out of sync with the actual java files which the web project seems to be using directly.p  pA quick and dirty solution is to manually Edit the Java Build Path for each project, and add mycore and other dependant projects in the Projects tab.  Is this best practice  Any other suggestionsp

Negative 27969 pI have a Pyramid web application that needs to send emails such as confirmation emails after registration, newsletters and so forth. I know how to send emails using smtplib in python and I decided on an smtp service I think sendgrid will do the trick.br The real problem is the scheduling and delay sending of the emails  for example, when a user registers, the email is to be sent on the form post view. But, I dont want to block the request, and therefore would like to schedule the email in a nonblocking way.br Other than implementing this myself probably with a DB and a worker, is there an existing solution to email queue and schedulingp  pThanksp

Negative 27969 pIf you use JPA or another kind of persistence, you probably have a way to save a record that is sent to client via ajax.p  pstrongEDIT  the interface is done with GWT, so all ajax call are classic java method converted to javascript equivalentstrongp  pLets take the class Person which is an entity in database. Person has four fields  codename, birthday, id, emailcodep  pWhen you load a person from server via ajax, you generally send to client a Person object.p  pIn your Person editor, you display the name, the birthday and the email. When the Person object is edited you may want to display the id.p  pThere are two cases  p  ul lisave person  only email can be changed but you can display idli licreate person  email, name and birthday can be changedli ul  pWhen you send the just edited datas to server, whats the way you proceed p  pI see several approaches p  ul lisend a Person object. In this case you must take care of data you persist and not only make the person object you received from client to persist mode because a hacker can send data you may not want to be changed and you cant trust on interface to disabled these changes. In this case, there is several approaches too  ul liuse two functions save and create, create a new Person object on server or load the persisted instance via the id if you are in the save method and copy all fields you want from the client Person object to the persisted oneli liuse one function saveOrCreate and check if id exists. It is equivalent to the above approach by merging the two functions in one with a big ifli ulli lisend datas to the server email, birthday, name, id in case of edit. When you do that, create a new Person object or load the persisted one and copy datas to this persisted instance.li ul  pTo summary you have one of the following method signature just for edit casep  ul licodePerson savePersonPerson personcodeli licodePerson savePersonString id, String emailcodeli ul  pI see pros and cons for each approach. For example the first allow quick change on the Person model without modifying all savePerson calls. But it is less readable than the second approach to know what is really saved.p  pI dont know what is the best one and if you know another way to do that. So, how do you do p

Negative 27969 pI am currently developing a game with Xcode 4.1.1 MBP recent, 8Gb mem. The project accounts for approximately 200K lines of objectiveC, 2500 resources.p  pAt times, Xcode comes to a screeching stall. I find i need to nuke it and restart. However, upon restart, Xcode bolts just about every byte of of free or inactive memory on my computer, and may eventually not start at all. In those circumstances, I see either mds or finder running furiously on multiple cores, and have to nuke them to even be able to nuke Xcode. After a few false starts, Xcode finally completes its startup often parked around 3Gb.p  pNow, here is the kicker if I quit and restart multiple times, it will eventually settle around 250 Mb of memory, and be workable again ... until the next screeching stall.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 27969 pAccording to a hrefhttpwww.ibm.comdeveloperworkslinuxlibrarylasyncthis tutoriala asynchronous disk file io can easily be achieved using AIO on linux, at least from a programmingapi pointofview. But before and after this tutorial I had read a lot of posts and articles that this either can not be done or you should use libevent with a patch and many other issues. Another thing was the loop that I should have waited for a signal, but based on this tutorial I can use a callback mechanism, which obviously makes AIO much easier to use.p  pNow, I am not a linux programmer even by a long shot I just wanted to find a straightforward way to support asynchronous disk file io on linux, learn it and add it to a async disk io library that I need for a personal project. Currently Im using overlapped io on windows and io worker threads on nonwindows platforms. Since the mutithreaded solution can be tricky, I wanted to replace it on linux with AIO. p  pSO, what is wrong with AIO as described in this tutorial Is it performance Is there a restriction on operations that can be done using AIOp  pp.s. I dont care if the code will not be portable to other POSIXcompliant platforms, as long as it works on major linux distributions. And all I care about is regular disk file io.p  pThanks.p

Negative 27969 pI am trying to build a Rails 3.1 app in which users can preview individual pages of documents or whole documents as a slideshow of pages. Thumbnailing is not a requirement but the ability to show the image at a size that allows reading isp  pThe documents are generated by me and so I control their format. Hence, if it helps to have individual pages as image files, then that can be done. But if its better to have them as PDF, then that is possible too. At any rate, the documents are all housed on a remote server  a VPS perhaps  and they are pulled for preview based on user selection andor permissionsp  pAnd so, I was wondering if anywhere here could make a suggestion for a Gem or a plugin example Cooliris that I could incorporate. I apologize for not being precise enough. But this is one of those times when I dont enough to even start asking the right question. I dont know, for example, what to do a Google search for or whether I really need to set up a media RSS feed  as Cooliris requiresp  pThanks in advance Abhinavp

Negative 27969 pstrongETA Ive got it working and the answer is posted below. Ill mark as the answer anyone who can explain exactly what is going on and how I can clean it up.strongp  pI have a class that contains a form with a winforms webbrowser control to display an html page. I inject some script into the head of the page so that I can query information about styles.p  pWhen I launch the app from an executable, everything works fine. However Im now attempting to launch the app from an addin at designtime. What happens is you rightclick on a .htm type file and click to launch the browser. The addin then launches the browser which navigates to the supplied .htm file path. p  pThe first thing I notice is that the browser now displays this messagep  pemTo help protect your security, your web browser has restricted this file from showing active content that could access your computer. Click here for options...emp  pI then noticed that all my javascript calls were now failing even if I clicked to enable active content.  p  pAs a test I tried this simple javascript call without explicit injection   p  precodeMe.Document.InvokeScriptexecScript, New Object alerthello, JavaScript codepre  pThis results in a javascript error dialog that says emaccess is deniedemp  pSo, this is a security issue. Not that I wanted to but, I tried temporarily reducing all security levels in IE but this made no difference.p  pI should add that the app contains 2 webbrowser controls. The second one hosts a web page that is created by setting the emDocumentTextem property of the browser. This does not suffer from javascript access issues.p  pETA Ive been looking into IInternetSecurityManager, could it be anything to do with that I hope not p

Negative 27969 pSay I want to assert that two structs are equivalentp  precode Using CGPoint here for brevity, but my question applies to any struct type CGPoint a  CGPointMake1, 2 CGPoint b  CGPointMake1, 2 STAssertEqualsa, b, this works assertThata, equalTob codepre  pIs there no way to write an assertion using Hamcrest that works like the codeSTAssertEqualscode above The codeassertThatcode line fails to compile as the macros expect codeidcode parameters, which structs are not. I tried variations of the codeequalTocode matcher, such as codesameInstancecode, but they all seem to require codeidcode typed parameters. Next, I thought a good workaround would be to assert that an arbitrary expression has a codeYEScode or codeNOcode value. Something like thisp  precodeassertThata  b codepre  por thisp  precodeassertThata  b, isTrue codepre  pBut I dont see anything like this in Hamcrest.p  pAm I am missing something obvious Clearly I can accomplish what I want to do by using the SenTest macros such as codeSTAssertEqualscode, but I had expected it to be simple to implement these assertions using Hamcrest, so that all my assertions have a consistent style.p  pI also know that I can do this by implementing a custom Hamcrest matcher for the particular structs I am comparing. But I was really looking for a simple assertionmatcher that can just compare any C structs for simple bytewise equality.p  pPerhaps its simply the case that none of the possibilities I have mentioned are possible out of the box with Hamcrest. If thats true, Ill accept a convincing explanation to this effect as the Answer.p  pThanksp

Negative 27969 pI am using codecom.sun.net.httpserver.HttpsServercode in my current project which deals with clientauthentification etc.. Currently it only prints out the clients addressport, so that I can check if one TCPconnection is used for multiple requests codekeepalivecode or if a new connection is established for every request and thus a new SSLhandshake is made every time. When I use FireFox to make multiple request against the server I can see that keepalive is working. So the server part works fine with GET and POSTrequests.p  pIf I use codeHttpURLConnectioncode to make a request against the Server in this case using strongnostrong SSL codekeepalivecode works, too Only one connection is established for multiple sequentially started requests.p  pBut if I use codeHttpsURLConnectioncode using exactly the same code, but strongusingstrong SSL then codekeepalivecode is not working anymore. So for each request a new connection is established, although I am using the same codeSSLContextcode and codeSSLSocketFactorycodep  precode URL myUrl  ...  SSLContext mySsl  ...

But nothing changed. The problem still exists.p

Negative 27969 pI have a windows service that needs to access the Windows Media Player libraries of all currently logged on users. Since its a service, I must impersonate the logged on user so that calls to the WMP COM will return information in the impersonated users context i.e. return the impersonated users library rather than the systems library. I need to do this for each logged on user.p  pI am able to successfully impersonate a user in a thread via codeImpersonateLoggedOnUsercode, get the users library, then perform a codeRevertToSelfcode.

Negative 27969 pThe page a hrefhttpwww.haskell.orghaskellwikiFoldrFoldlFoldl27 relnofollowFoldr Foldl Foldla discusses codefoldlcode, and defines it likep  precodefoldl f z []      z foldl f z xxs  let z  z f x                      in seq z  foldl f z xs codepre  pThis is done to avoid space leaks, i.e. so codefoldcode that produces a constant size result only uses constant space.p  pHowever, this doesnt necessarily work, as pointed out herep  blockquote   pThe involved codeseqcode function does only evaluate the topmost constructor. If the accumulator is a more complex object, then codefoldcode will still build up unevaluated thunks.p blockquote  pThe obvious solution is to change codeseqcode to a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgpackagesarchivedeepseq1.3.0.0dochtmlControlDeepSeq.htmlv3adeepseq relnofollowcodedeepseqcodea as shown assuming youre working with a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgpackagesarchivedeepseq1.3.0.0dochtmlControlDeepSeq.htmlt3aNFData relnofollowcodeNFDatacodeap  precodefoldlstrict f z []      z foldlstrict f z xxs  let z  z f x                            in deepseq z  foldlstrict f z xs codepre  pBut I have a feeling this can be horribly inefficient, as the entire structure will need to be traversed by codedeepseqcode each pass through the loop unless the compiler can statically prove this is not necessary.p  pI then tried thisp  precodefoldlstricter  f z l       deepseq z  foldlstricter f z l foldlstricter f z []      z foldlstricter f z xxs  let z  deepseq x  z f x                               in seq z  foldlstricter f z xs codepre  pBut found it had this issue. The below fails when it should return 3.p  precodefoldlstricter x y gt x  head y 0 [[1..],[2..]] codepre  pSo codefoldstrictercode is too strict. The list need not be strict, what is important to prevent a space leak is that the accumulator is strict. codefoldstrictercode goes too far and also makes the list strict also, which causes the above to fail.p  pWhich takes us back to codefoldstrictcode. Does repeatedly running codedeepseqcode on a data structure of size codencode take codeOncode time, or only codeOncode time the first time and codeO1code thereafter As a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers1256624dbauppdbauppa suggests in his a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11093922haskellastricterfoldwithdeepseqcomment1452759111093922commenta belowp

Negative 27969 pWhen rendering to a frame buffer object in gles 2.0 I have some strange artifacts on the Mali400 gpu. Problem is that some pixels have different colors than others even if I fill the whole screen with the same color. But it works fine on a Tegra2 gpu. Does the Mali use any texture compression by default My fbo uses GLRGBA as internal format.  Thanks in advance p  pEdit I guess I solved my own question. The problem was simply that GLDITHER was enabled by default on the Mali, while is seems that it was not on the Tegra. A simple glDisableGLDITHER solved the problem. p

Negative 27969 pIf it was decided to use WebAPI to create a service layer to be used for a variety of clients.  What would be the best way to architect the web client  p  pAs WebAPI is webfriendly it would be possible to consume this directly from the client using javascript.  However I would worry that this can get messy fairly quickly and javascript is not the easiest technology to unit test.p  pAn alternative would be to use the HttpClient class to call the REST services from MVC controllers.  Is this a valid approachp  pI suppose that the two approachs above could be combined but I would worry that this would get messy.  Would you agree that it would be better to go with one approach or the anotherp  pSorry I have seen many posts on whether to use WebAPI or MVC but none on combining the two.p  pThoughtsp

Negative 27969 pIm trying to use a 3rd party UI control in our WPF application. There are a lot of featurescharacteristics with this particular control that make it appealing, but their licensing scheme has been a real pain... But maybe this is how a lot of 3rd party vendors operate.p  pIn our solution, we have two projects of concern. For simplicity, I will denote them as StartUpProject and FeatureAProject. Suppose the other projects in the application that other devs will be working on are named FeatureBProject, FeatureCProject and so onp  pStartUpProject contains references to all of the FeatureProjects.p  pThe 3rd party dlls are located in a common References folder, and both projects StartUpProject and FeatureAProject reference the 3rd party assemblies from this file location.p  p StartUpProject is the main WPF start up project including the App.xamlApp.xaml.cs. It contains a licx file with a single entry for the 3rd party control.p  p FeatureAProject contains the implementation of this 3rd party UI control.p  pDue to the way the 3rd party control companys licensing scheme is implemented, in order to simply build the application through VS, every developer must install a licensed copy of the 3rd party control  even those that are working on other features other than FeatureA.p  pThere has to be a way around this...p  pI would like to structure our solution and projects in such a way that the 3rd party control developer i.e. FeatureA developer is the only one that needs a licensed copy of the controls installed on their machine and other developers can still build the solution.p  pMy first thought is to utilize a binary reference thats built from the licensed dev machine.p  p1 Im not sure which assembly would need to be the binary reference StartUpPorject or FeatureAProject Is it the licx file in StartUpPorject that triggers the license checking and hence the exception on build for unlicensed developersp  p2 If we take the binary reference route, the reference will need to be updated each time the one developer makes changes to FeatureAProject... That would work, but the extra overhead is certainly not ideal. Is there are better way around this altogether Could we somehow refactor this whole 3rd party control usage into an additional assembly thats build once from the licensed machine FeatureA could then use this assembly and it would not have to be updated when changes are made to FeatureA.p  pI hope that makes sense.p  pThanksp
Negative 27969 pI am having a bit of an issue with a particular page on my wordpress site. Because of the design, the page is quite large in size as it has multiple internal tabs etc etc. The trouble is that all of a sudden I stopped being able to add content.

I have searched like mad for similar issues to no avail.p  pSo far I have reinstalled wordpress, checked all plugins, checked that it isnt a theme based issue. Interestingly under a wordpress.com hosted blog, I am able to add over the 64kb limit no problem so I immediately went to my hosting provide.

I have created a function import in the Entity Framework designer that should pull in these results as a collection of a complex type  MonthlyForecastResult. The problem I am having is that the values in the MonthlyForecastResult object arent the same values generated by the stored procedure.p  pLooking at a trace in the SQL Server Profiler I can see the EXEC call generated by entity framework when the function is called. Executing the stored procedure using the generated call directly in SQL Server returns the correct result but the MonthlyForecastResult objects returned by the function dont have the same values as the stored procedure results. p  pAdditionally the BaseSales and ForecastSales values are always the same value in the MonthlyForecastResult objects even if they are very different in the stored procedures results.p  pThe only thing I could think of that might be causing it would be some mix up with entity keys, but the problem happens even if only 1 row would be return and I wouldnt have thought that entity keys would come into play on Complex Type objects anyway.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI discovered today after updating the production version of the application that the behaviour Im having trouble with only seems to occur in the development environment. Running the application on the clients server connected to their database seems to be producing the correct figures in that there are the differences I would expect between the base sales and forecast sales.

I was trying to create a sorting algorithm from a hash function that gives a value biased on alphabetical sequence of the string, it then would ideally place it in the right place from that hash. i tryed looking for a hashbiased sorting function but only found one for integers and would be a memory hog if adapted for my purposes. p  pThe reasoning is that theoretically if done right this algorithm can achieve On speeds or nearly so. p  pSo here is what i have worked out in python so farp  precodeletters  a0,b1,c2,d3,e4,f5,g6,h7,i8,j9, k10,l11,m12,n13,o14,p15,q16,r17, s18,t19,u20,v21,w22,x23,y24,z25, A0,B1,C2,D3,E4,F5,G6,H7,I8,J9, K10,L11,M12,N13,O14,P15,Q16,R17, S18,T19,U20,V21,W22,X23,Y24,Z25      def sortlistlistToSort     listLen  lenlistToSort     newlist  []     for i in listToSort         k  letters[i[0]]         for j in i[1]             k  k26  letters[j]         norm  kpow26,leni  get a float hash that is normalizedi think thats what     it is called           2nd part         idx  intnormlennewlist  get a general of where it should go         if newlist find the right place from idx             if norm lt newlist[idx][1]                 while norm lt newlist[idx][1] and idx gt 0 idx  1                 if norm gt newlist[idx][1] idx  1             else                 while norm gt newlist[idx][1] and idx lt lennewlist1 idx  1                 if norm gt newlist[idx][1] idx  1         newlist.insertidx,[i,norm] put it in the right place with the norm to ref     later when sorting     return newlist codepre  pi think that the 1st part is good, but the 2nd part needs help. so the Qs would be what would be the best way to do something like this or is it even possible to get On time or near that out of thisp  pthe testing i did with an 88,000 word list took prob about 5 min, 10,000 took about 30 sec it got a lot worse as the list count went up.p  pif this idea actually works out then i would recode it in C to get some real speed and optimizations. p  pThe 2nd part is there only because it works  even if slow, and i cant think of a better way to do it for the life of me, i would like to replace it with something that would not have to do the other loops if at all possible.p  pthank for any advice or ideas that you could give.p

Negative 27969 pIm using TFS 2012 Build and running into an error Access to the path is denied.  The solution being built contains about 15 projects of which a number are using the Castle.Components.Validator.2.5.0 assembly.p  I have seen other posts that talk about the TFS Build Access Denied errors, but they generally refer to having simultaneous builds running.  In this case only one build runs at a time.  Also, the error occurs when the server is restarted or the build has not run for some time.pOnce a build is run and fails, the next one succeeds and each one after that succeeds again until the build hasnt been run for a while or the server is restarted.  Although we can get around this, it is a manual headache.p  Here is the error CWINDOWSMicrosoft.NETFramework64v4.0.30319Microsoft.Common.targets 3513 Unable to copy file DBuilds12FooCheckIn BuildSourcespackagesCastle.Components.Validator.2.5.0libNET40Castle.Components.Validator.dll to DBuilds12FooCheckIn BuildBinariesCastle.Components.Validator.dll.p Access to the path DBuilds12FooCheckIn BuildBinariesCastle.Components.Validator.dll is denied.p  ppWhen looking at the log file you can see that the build is trying to copy the file twice.

Negative 27969 pI would like put the code first and then explain the situation and ask my question based on thatp  precodepublic partial class MainWindow  Window       public MainWindow          InitializeComponent           private async void ButtonClick2object sender, RoutedEventArgs e           var result  await GetValuesAsync         Foo.Text  result           public async Taskltstringgt GetValuesAsync                      using var httpClient  new HttpClient               var response  await httpClient                 .GetAsynchttpwww.google.com                 .ConfigureAwaitcontinueOnCapturedContext false                This is the continuation for the httpClient.GetAsync method.              We shouldnt get back to sync context here              Cuz the continueOnCapturedContext is set to false              for the Task which is returned from httpClient.GetAsync method             var html  await GetStringAsync               This is the continuation for the GetStringAsync method.              Should I get back to sync context here              Cuz the continueOnCapturedContext is set to true              for the Task which is returned from GetStringAsync                However, GetStringAsync may be executed in another thread              which has no knowledge for the sync context               because the continueOnCapturedContext is set to false              for the Task which is returned from httpClient.GetAsync method.               But, on the other hand, GetStringAsync method also has a               chance to be executed in the UI thread but we shouldnt be              relying on that.              html  Hey...

When you look at the codeGetValuesAsynccode code, you will see the usage of codeawaitcode keyword twice. With the first usage, I set codecontinueOnCapturedContextcode parameter of the codeTask.ConfigureAwaitcode method to codefalsecode. So, this indicates that I strongdont necessarily wantstrong my continuation to be executed inside the codeSynchronizationContext.Currentcode. So far so good.p  pAt the second codeawaitcode usage with the codeGetStringAsynccode method, I didnt call the codeConfigureAwaitcode method. So, I basically indicated that I strongwantstrong to get back to current synchronization context for the continuation of the codeGetStringAsynccode method. So, as you can see, I try to set the codeTextBlock.Textcode which belongs to UI thread property inside the continuation.p  pWhen I run the application and click the button, I get an exception giving me the following message p  blockquote   pThe calling thread cannot access this object because a different   thread owns it.p blockquote  pAt first, this made no sense to me and I thought that I discovered a bug but then, I realized that codeGetStringAsynccode may be executed in another thread highly likely which is different than the UI thread and has no knowledge for the sync context because the codecontinueOnCapturedContextcode is set to codefalsecode for the codeTaskcode which is returned from codehttpClient.GetAsynccode method.p  pIs this the case here Also, in this case, is there a chance for codeGetStringAsynccode method to be posted back to UI thread bacuse the httpClient.GetAsync method continuation may be executed inside the UI threadp  pI have also a few comments inside the code. In view of my questions and the comments inside the code, am I missing anything herep

My a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiContinuousintegration relnofollowcontinuous integrationa CI environment is a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTeamFoundationServer relnofollowTeam Foundation Servera TFS build 2010 and TFS for source control.p  pI have a number of requirements that I would like to achieve with this. Firstly, each time I create the publish package for release, I would like the build number to be incremented and revision number reset to 0 in my version file. I currently have one version file that contains the version number of codeMajor.Minor.Build.Revisioncode. So I would like the creation of the publishing package to do such. Is this possible and if so how is it achieved Note as this increments the version file, as part of this process I would like this checked in to source control.p  pMy second question is that each time a developer checks in to the TFS build server, the revision number will get incremented or at least changed to a new value. I had hoped to update my build template to achieve this, but unfortunately due to restrictions on my build server I can not incorporate any custom activities on it. So I am looking to perform this task with a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMSBuild relnofollowMSBuilda. Is it possible to achieve what I outlined here with MSBuild and if so, could I get an explanation pleasep

I am able to retrieve data from the database and display it on the iPhone with the app, and also able to save records from the app to the database. Its all so very cool, and Im really jazzed about it.p  pThe final phase of the project requires uploading a camera image to the server. This is the part where it gets funky for me.p  pSo far I have been able to save the image as a file on the iPhones disk. Now I need to understand better how to transfer that file to a directory on the server.p  pI know that there are many techniques that use the post method, but as I understand it, that requires a PHP or ASP page to accomplish. FTP generally uses ports 20 and 21. What I would really like is to be able to set up the existing software to receive an upload request from the app, and then place itself in receive mode. This would not require opening another port, and I can tailor the VB code to handle the file however I like.p  pAll I really need to understand is, how can I get the two programs to do the file transfer And is it reasonable to assume that I can use the same portp

Negative 27969 pLoading emacs into the terminal console window, at the top is a menu containing File, Edit, Options, etc. As far as my googles have told me, the way to access it is by F10, Mx menubaropen, etc. However, this opens a new buffer with the contents of the menu bar. This seems ridiculous to me. Why would the developer want to waste an entire line of available screen with a menu that doesnt do anythingp  pUnless there is a way to expand a menu item, like have File open downward and let me select options with my keyboard without opening a new buffer which I cant figure out how to do, I dont see any purpose to having a menu bar at the top other than to remind me that File, Edit, etc. exists.p  pSo is there a way to get a menu item to expand Or is it just a reminderp

Negative 27969 pIm transferring files using http post request from one host to another. Receiving host runs apache with php onboard. The request contains multipartformdata and is performing by php script cURL. There are 86 files with total size about 20Mb. The issue is the receiving php script gots empty POST array. I reconfigured sending script so it sends the same request in loop but removes one file from data collection on each iteration. When 36 files total size 12Mb are removed the receiving script accepts the data, POST variable is populated well. What can be wrong Ive reviewed all resposible php.ini parameters, so they contain reasonable values.p  precode  inisetpostmaxsize,510M    inisetmemorylimit,400M    inisetuploadmaxfilesize,510M    inisetmaxfileuploads,500  codepre  pIs there a way to investigate the reason I mean, errorlog doesnt contain anything useful.

Negative 27969 pI happy coded quite a project that works fine and do not manifest any oddities at runtime. So Ive decided to run static code analysis tool Im using Visual Studio 2010. It came out that rule codeCA2000code is being violated, message as followsp  pWarning  CA2000  Microsoft.Reliability  In method Bar.getDefaultFoo, call System.IDisposable.Dispose on object new Foo before all references to it are out of scope.p  pThe code refered goes like thisp  precodeprivate static IFoo getDefaultFoo      return Baz.canIDoIt  new Foo  null  codepre  pI thought myself maybe conditional expression spoils the logic mine or validators. Changed to thisp  precodeprivate static IFoo getDefaultFoo      IFoo ret  null     if Baz.canIDoIt              retFoo  new Foo          return ret  codepre  pSame thing happened again, but now the object was referred to as coderetFoocode. Ive googled, Ive msdned, Ive stackoverflowed. Found a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms182289.aspxthis articlea. There are no operations I need done after creating the object. I only need to return the reference to it. However, I have tried to apply the pattern suggested in OpenPort2 example. Now code looks like thisp  precodeprivate static IFoo getDefaultFoo      Foo tempFoo  null     Foo retFoo  null     try              if Baz.canIDoIt                      tempFoo  new Foo                  retFoo tempFoo         tempFoo  null          finally              if tempFoo  null                      tempFoo.Dispose                   return retFoo  codepre  pSame message again, but codetempFoocode variable is rule violator this time. So basically, code went twisted, longer, little irrational, unnecesarrily complex and does the very same, but slower.p  pIve also found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4264986todisposeornottodisposeca2000this questiona, where same rule seems to attack a valid code in similar manner. And there questioner is adviced to ignore the warning. Ive also read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10697532whydoesthismethodcausecodeanalysiserrorca2000calldisposethis threada and a mass of similar questions.p  pIs there anything I missed Is the rule bugged  irrelevant What should I do Ignore Handle in some magickal way Maybe apply some design patternp  pEditp  pAfter Nicoles request, Im submiting the whole related code in form I also tried of using.p  precodepublic class DisposableFooTest      public interface IFoo              void bar           public class Foo  IFoo, IDisposable              public void bar                      Console.Out.WriteLineFoo baring now                   public void Dispose                       actual Dispose implementation is irrelevant, or maybe it is              anyway I followed microsoft dispose pattern              with Disposebool disposing                    public static class Baz              private static bool toggle  false         public static bool canIDoIt                      toggle  true             return toggle                    private static IFoo getDefaultFoo              IFoo result  null         try                      if Baz.canIDoIt                              result  new Foo                           return result                  catch                      if result  null                              result as IDisposable.Dispose                  IFoo does not inherit from IDisposable, hence the cast                           throw                    public static void Main              IFoo bar  getDefaultFoo       codepre  pAnalysis report contain the folowingbr CA2000  Microsoft.Reliability  In method DisposableFooTest.getDefaultFoo, call System.IDisposable.Dispose on object result before all references to it are out of scope.   projectpathDisposableFooTest.cs 44 Testp  pEdit2p  pThe following approach resolved CA2000 problemp  precodeprivate static IFoo getDefaultFoo      Foo result  null     try              if Baz.canIDoIt                      result  new Foo                  return result          finally              if result  null                      result.Dispose                codepre  pUnfortunately, I cant go that way.

But in my solutions I have also a WCF RIA project which contains linked files because they are used somewhere else also and there is no possibility to add a reference to a general .NET binary in WCFSilverlight.p  pEverything builds without any problem on my development machine but when I check it all in, create a standard build definition and run that build definition I get the following problem. The linked files have codeusingscode UsingNamespace for example to other projects that are also build by us and build before the WCFSilverlight but the following error pops up while building through TFS Build server p  blockquote   pThe type or namespace UsingNamespace could not be found are you   missing a using directive or an assembly referencep blockquote  pIs there any solution for this problem that I looked overp  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pJust tried to set the codeCopy to Output Directorycode propertie of the linked files to codeCopy Alwayscode but this still gives me the same error as I was expecting. The problem is that the linked file is placed somewhere that it can use the codeusingscode but the WCF RIA service cannot accessfind that using.p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pJust tried out my local test TFS where I can do what I want and there I made a build definition with just the solutions needed to make that the project with the linked files builds. This worked without any problem. Then I tried the same on our TFS server with a new build definition that has the same solutions as on my test TFS and here it did not work. The only difference that I know for sure is that my test TFS is TFS 2012 Update 1 and that my production TFS does not have the update 1 yet. Ill try to install it next week.p  pstrongEDIT 3strongp  pIve just updated our production TFS to Update 1 but it is still not working with my temporary build definition which only contains the projects that are needed to build the silverlight application with the linked files. The 2 workspaces are the same on both server and the projects to build are also the same.p

I cannot remove items during the foreach loop because I get codeConcurrentModificationExceptioncode. So my solution is to remove all list items after the foreach loop ends.

It does find a way to assemble the required item if it is possible, but it does not optimize the assembly path.p  pI want to optimize the path in two waysp  ul liFirst, choose the path which takes the least number of assemblydisassembly actions.li liSecond, if there are various such paths, choose the path which leave the least amount of disassembled components in the store.li ul  pNow, here I am at a complete loss of how to get this optimization done I am not even sure if this is a question for SO or for Maths.p  pstrongHow can I alter codegetAssemblyPathcode so that it meets my optimization requirementsstrongp  pMy code so farp  precode usrbinpython  class Component     def init self, name self.name  name      def repr self return Component .format self.name  class Product     def init self, name, components         self.name  name         self.components  components      property     def components self return self.components      def repr self return Product .format self.name  class Store     def init self self.items        def iadd self, item         item, count  item         if not item in self.items self.items [item]  0         self.items [item]  count         return self      property     def items self return item for item in self.items.items        property     def products self return  item, count for item, count in self.items.items  if isinstance item, Product       property     def components self return  item, count for item, count in self.items.items  if isinstance item, Component       def getAssemblyPath self, product, count         if product in self.items             take  min count, self.items [product]              print Take  of .format take, product              count  take             if not count return         components  dict  comp, count for comp in product.components         for comp, count in self.components             if comp not in components continue             take  min count, components [comp]              print Take  of .format take, comp              components [comp]  take             if not components [comp] del components [comp]             if not components return         for prod, count in self.products             if prod  product continue             shared  set prod.components amp set components.keys               dis  min max components [comp] for comp in shared, count             print Disassemble  of ..format dis, prod              for comp in shared                 print Take  of ..format dis, comp                  components [comp]  take                 if not components [comp] del components [comp]                 if not components return         print Missing components         for comp, count in components.items              print  of ..format count, comp   c1  Component alpha c2  Component bravo c3  Component charlie c4  Component delta  p1  Product A, [c1, c2]  p2  Product B, [c1, c2, c3]  p3  Product C, [c1, c3, c4]   store  Store  store  c2, 100 store  c4, 100 store  p1, 100 store  p2, 100 store  p3, 10 store.getAssemblyPath p3, 20 codepre  pThis outputsp  precodeTake 10 of Product C Take 10 of Component delta Disassemble 10 of Product A.

I am looking for least number of touched items, no matter whether they be distinct or not.p  blockquote   pThat is, is is better to dissassemble 20 of Product A than to dissassemble 10 of Product A and an additional 5 of Product Bp blockquote  pThe latter is closer to optimum.p  blockquote   pFurther, you say you want to avoid leaving many components behind, but in your current code all disassembled components that are not used by the requested Product are lost. Is that deliberate that is, do you want to be throwing away the other components, or is it a bugp blockquote  pThe method codegetAssemblyPathcode only determines the path of how to get the items. It does not touch the actual store. At no moment it assigns to codeself.itemscode. Think of it as a function that issues an order to the store keep of what he must do in the inmediate future, in order to get the required amount of the required item out of his store.p  pp  pEDIT 2p  pThe first obvious or at least obvious to me way to tackle this issue, is to search first those products, that share the maximum amount of components with the required product, as you get more required components out of each disassembly. But unfortunately this doesnt necessary yield the optimum path. Take for instancep  pProduct A consisting of components , , , ,  and .p  pProduct B consisting of components , , , ,  and .p  pProduct C consisting of components , , , ,  and .p  pProduct D consisting of components , , , ,  and .p  pWe have in store 0 of A, 100 of B, 100 of C and 100 of D. We require 10 of A. Now if we look first for the products that shares most components with A, we will find B. We disassemble 10 of B getting 10 each of , ,  and . But then we need to disassemble 10 of C to get  and 10 of D to get . These would be 40 actions 30 disassembling and 10 assembling. But the optimum way would be to disassemble 10 of C and 10 of D 30 actions, 20 disassembling and 10 assembling.p  pp  pEDIT 3p  pstrongYou dont need to post python code to win the bounty. Just explain the algorithm to me and show that it does indeed yield the optimum path, or one of the optima if several exist.strongp
Negative 27969 pI have a vertical scrollview containing several single line edittexts amongst others.p  pMy layout is landscape only.p  pI am unable to scroll the scrollview beyond the edittext that has the cursor in it.p  pIf I change the edittext that has the cursor in it I can scroll until that edittext reaches the top or bottom edge of the screen.p  pThe only controls on this activity that can receive the cursorfocus is the edittexts in the scrollview. Setting them not to have focus fixes the scrolling issue but obviously I cannot then enter any values.p  pPlease advise how can I resolve thisp  pDue to the complexity of this layout Im only listing

Negative 27969 pI have installed the official windows git distribution, and I installed a recent mingw, and into that the mintty terminal. Then I have copied my git installation to this mingw installation, and now it works from within mintty. My only problem is that the git output is not colored. I suspect that this is because the windows git port tries to use the windows console color thingie and not the ANSI color codes which mintty would be able to interpret. Is it possible to make git use the ANSI color codes instead p  psupI have tried a cygwin setup prior to this, but the performance was very, very bad, and I could not find any solution to that.supp

Negative 27969 pI have a library which records real time audio and computes real time FFT data for the audio. The client must call a start method to start the recording, and a stop method to end the recording.p  pMy design question is concerning the best way to get this data back to the client. I have considered the following approachesp  ol liHave a method called codegetDataint sizecode that the client will call periodically after they have started the recording. It will return up to size audio samples, or as much data as is available. My thought for this is that the client would run an codeAsyncTaskcode to periodically call for more data. The problems with this approach is it is much less efficient, and is more complicated for the client, but it does allow for them to have more control over when and how much data they receive.li liHave the client pass in an output stream to my start method to which I would just send the data as soon as I have it. This is simpler but is more restrictive.li liSimilarly, instead of an output stream, have the client pass in some sort of structure like an codeArrayListcode, that would just be shared between us and that I would push data onto.li liLastly, I have thought about having my start method return an output stream or codeArrayListcode similarly that the client would just read from.  li ol  pFrom the clients point of view, which would you prefer and why Or are there some other alternatives that I am completely overlooking Any input would be appreciated, thanksp
Negative 27969 pI know that SO has a lot of posts about validating data when persisting objects through jpaHibernate. Most of the answers says that a read of data should be performed before the persist so that an exception very rarely is thrown during the actual persistence. p  pThis, as opposed to relying on db constraints, has bad impact on performance. Also, a reason for this extensive read of data before the persist, seems to be important because we really dont know exactly when and how the hibernate exception will appear. But with that reasoning, if an exception arises because of a rare reason we still wont be able to handle it in a good way. p  pSo, my thought was to use a bean beanA that iterates over a list of objects and in each iterations it calls another beanbeanB that has a method called persistOneObject. persistOneObject is annotated requiresnew. So on fail only that single transaction is rolled back and we continue with next object in a new transaction. p  pShould this theoretically work or is it hard to reach this behavior because youre not sure when Hibernate really commits and so on Is this bad design I wont supply any code example now since I would like to hear general thoughts on the design rather than specific thoughts about the implementation. Is there any other way to solve it Or should I go with the read before persist  p  pThank youp

Negative 27969 pFirst of all this is not a question about virus programming, since many similar questions i found were accused of having such motives.p  pThis question is about a windows programm, just for clarification.p  pIm improving a programm for an internet cafe of my uncle, the program is supposed to limit access to the computer by letting the user pay for it. The problem in this special case is that my uncle would like his customers to be able to install things to the computers and do other things which require administrative rightsI know this is probably not very wise, but he wants it to be that way.p  pNow in order for this programm to stay alive, currently my solution relies on three processes which monitor each other, if one process dies or is frozen it is restarted. The problem with this solution is obvious if one were to kill all processes at once or to freeze all of them at once while being logged inyou have to be logged in in order for explorer.exe to be actually running, so in order to beat the system you have to login at least oncep  pIve not yet found a solution to this problem which suites my needs and I am aware that this might look a lot like virus programming.p  pHere is a list of solutions which were already considered and do not match my needp  p1 A kernel mode driver which monitors the processes and makes sure it is running. Unfortunatly the only way to punish the user from kernel mode Ive found is to cause a Blue Screen, which is not a very nice solution and could damage the computer.p  p2 A combination of two processes One is a client side service which restarts the computer, when the processes are no longer running and one is a process on the side of the login server, when the heartbeat of the clients is lost, it sends a restart command to the client. Of course services can be killed and restarts can be avoided by administrator users.p  p3 Since we have a linux firewall to regulate the access to the network, we could strip the pc of its internet connection upon losing the heartbeat from the client.p  p4 We could use IP power sockets, which would receive a shutdown request from the server upon loss of heartbeat.p  pAs you see none of the above solutions is perfect.p

It makes it quicker to add to my adapter  when the image is small I have no lags when scrolling my AdapterView. When the image is big, even if I use downsampling it lags a bit. I found out, that codeaquerycode stores the full version of image and downsamples it every time I call codeaq.image...code. strongHow to cache the resized versionstrong, not the original onep  hr  pstrongLong storystrong My AdapterView relies heavily on images. These images are rather big, and when adapter items gets instantiated it takes some time to downsample it and then add to the list. So I thought it would be nice, to instantiate items with a lores photo when scrolling, and only load the hires version when the scrolling stops. It works like a charm, when I use two separate image urls one for thumnbail and another for the original image. But the API I work with is quite limited, so I wont have the thumbnail images urls. I have to async download the big version, downsample it, save both big and small version and then use whichever I need. And here the short story begins.p
Negative 27969 pThis is a subtle problem I have a custom tableview cell with a slider and a segmented control. When the table goes to editing mode everything looks good and when the red delete button appears, both the slider and segmented control shrink in width to leave room on the right for the delete button, and this shrink gets animated correctly. So all is good.p  pHowever, when the user does not go through with the delete and instead taps out of bounds, the slider immediately springs back to its full width before the delete button animation swipe finishes.

Negative 27969 pASP.NET newbie here, Im looking for a way to integrate my existing database into ASP.NETs authentication system. I have a separate project making use of Entity Framework to interact with a database ModelFirst Entity Framework 5 that I would like my ASP.NET MVC 4 site to use to authenticate off.p  pTo further complicate matters, this is not a simple usernamehashsalt table. I employ a hrefhttpwww.opine.meabetterwaytostorepasswordhashes relnofollowBlind Hashinga and two factor authentication using the Google Authenticator OATHTOTP is an option users can have. Additionally, I dont just have users, I have Accounts and Profiles, of which an Account can have many profiles distinct, separate users in a public sense that the owner can easily switch between. Lastly, Account can also have several emails, not just one. In other words, this doesnt fit in to normal userpassword conventions when dealing with authentication. Fortunately, Ive written partial classes to give most of these entities such as Account ways to handle this easily, such asp  pcodesomeAccount.CheckPasswordpassword[, twoFactorToken]codep  pI can do this easily enough using Entity Framework 5, but Im very unfamiliar with how ASP.NET MVC 4 handles users. Is there an easy way to get user authentication going in ASP.NET MVC 4 Do I need to do something with MembershipProvider Do I use SimpleMembership or the legacy one Bonus Can I take advantage of Windows Identity Framework and use that insteadp

CPolyIndices is the index array. CPolyVerts is the vertex array. CPolyTriangles is the number of triangles to render.p  pAs you can see, before it renders, it sets WorldViewProj to the matrix already assigned to the device, so the default shader and custom shader must be using the same transformation matrix.  Indeed, it doesnt render in the wrong place, it just renders where it was supposed to be a few frames ago its tough to tell exactly how many frames behind it is, but it looks like about 3.p  pIf I simply comment out the lines where it turns the custom shader on and off between draws, the problem goes away.  This is the first time Ive tried using custom shaders and the default shader in the same render cycle, so its possible I missed something that I wasnt even aware of.  Anyone heard of this beforep  hr

I followed their guide to implement video sharing a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comblogpost20110804howtousethegraphapitouploadavideoios relnofollowherea, but instead of using a video included in the app I want to allow the user to pick a video from UIImagePicker that then uploads to Facebook.

Once I chose my video in UIImagePicker it opened the Facebook app, asked for permissions for my app to access the profile and post, and then nothing. Just a blank white popover controller over the main Facebook app. If I try to run it again it just tells me that Ive already authorized the app, so I click OK and it brings me to the same white screen.

Negative 27969 pI have created multiple jQGrids on the same page using jqueryUI tabs.  The data loads fine on both tabs click on tab 2 first  since im not loading data on page load initially.p  pAnyway, to recreate the problem I am experiencing download the code below or browse to the jsfiddle link  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netut5aE relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netut5aEa and do the followingbr 1. Click on Tab 2br 2. Click on any search operation  and notice that the other list of search operations come up.br 3. Click on Tab 1br 4. Click on any search operation  and notice that the other list of search operations come up.br 5. Click back on Tab 2br 6. Click on any search operation  on any column EXCEPT for the 1st column serial.  Now the search operation window showing the other search operations does NOT pop up and I get the following javascript error in the file jquery.jqGrid.src.jsbrbrp  blockquote   pLine 4156   Error Unable to get property searchoptions of undefined or null referencep blockquote  pThis is the exact line of code the error is on including screen shot taken while debuggingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commXC5y.png altenter image description herep  pbrbr What is strange is that the operations ONLY work for the columns that have the same NAMES across all tabs.  Notice that clicking on the search operation  ONLY on the 1st column e.g. serial will WORK on both tabs, no matter how often you switch between the tabs.  But the rest of the search options do not work on tab 2 when you click on them  you receive no popup listing the other search operations, and will get the JS error noted above. brbrp  pHere is the

Negative 27969 pIm designing an extension for Google Chrome, and Id really like to earn a little cash from it if possible so Im not eager to post the code in its entirety. I hope this isnt a prohibitive limitation for my question.p  pIm injecting a content script into all websites as part of my extension, and part of the content script includes a touchsensitive overlay its an invisible HTML div thats been assigned a swipe listener. The idea is to add swiping functionality to every website on which the script is run.p  pIm having issues, though, with the overlay seeming to die on certain pages, especially after scrolling down the page. It registers swipes flawlessly all across google.com scrolling or otherwise but, for example, seems to die on engadget.com after scrolling down the page a bit. After scrolling a bit more, it often starts registering swipes again. Doing something like opening the console F12 also causes it to start registering swipes, and refreshing the page to the same place the object was before lets it start registering again.p  pThe HTMLJavaScript Im utilizing for the overlay is thisp  precodeltdiv class  touchsensitiveoverlay style  top40opacity1positionfixedheight247pxzindex99999width50left50border2px solid   blackgtltdivgt.prependTobody codepre  pIm using the jQuery Mobile library to register the swipes. p  pAny helpful insights would be profoundly appreciated.p  hr  pUpdatep  pA solution was proposed by Sumurai8, and was successfully implemented. The document was listened to for scrolling, and whenever scrolling occurred the overlay was removed from the injected HTML, then immediately reinjected. In this way, the overlay is continuously active, and responds to input on all websites. Thanks for the good thinking, Sumurai8.p

Ive even tried moving it outside of the validation and it still wont set.p  precodefunction create      requirepermissionINVOICEEDIT      thisgtloadgtlibraryformvalidation     thisgtformvalidationgtsetrulesinvoicenumber, Invoice Number, required      ifthisgtformvalidationgtrun  false          post  thisgtinputgtpost          thisgtsessiongtsetuserdatacreateinvoicevendor, post[vendorid]         thisgtsessiongtsetuserdatacreateinvoicedate, post[invoicedate]          invoicenumberexists  thisgtinvoicesgtcountarrayinvoicenumber gt post[invoicenumber] gt 0          post[invoicedate]  dateYmd, strtotimepost[invoicedate]         post[duedate]  dateYmd, strtotimepost[duedate]         post[dateentered]  now          id  thisgtinvoicesgtinsertinvoicepost          thisgtloadgtmodelvendors          ifissetpost[invoicenumber]             stringcheck post[invoicenumber]             stringcheck pregreplaced, , stringcheck             stringcheck pregreplacew, , stringcheck              invoicepatternarray             invoicepattern  thisgtdbgtselectinvoicepatterngtwherevendorid,                                         post[vendorid]gtgetvendorsgtresult             invoicepatterninvoicepattern[0]gtinvoicepattern codepre  pemem  THIS IS WHERE I NEED HELP p  precode                    ifinvoicepattern  stringcheck                         content[postcheck]  1                         thisgtinvoicesgtflaginvoiceid                                                           history  array                     type      gt invoiceentered,                     comments  gt Invoice was entered,                     link      gt id,                     adminid  gt thisgtusergtadminid,                     date      gt now,                                      thisgtvendorsgtinserthistorypost[vendorid], history                  ifpost[flagged]  1                      thisgtinvoicesgtflaginvoiceid                                   ifinvoicenumberexists                      redirectinvoicesconfirminvoice.id                  else                       redirectinvoicesview.id                     redirectinvoicescreate                                        content[accounts]  thisgtdbgtgetacctchartofaccountsgtresult             content[expenseaccounts]  thisgtdbgtgetinvoiceexpenseaccountsgtresult             content[vendors]  thisgtdbgtselectvendorid, name, terms, override, invoicepattern                           gtorderbyname ASCgtgetvendorsgtresult             content[terms]  thisgtdbgtquerySELECT DISTINCTterms FROM vendorsgtresult                    thisgttemplate[subheading]  Create     thisgttemplate[content]  thisgtloadgtviewinvoicescreate, content, true     thisgttemplate[sidebar]  thisgtloadgtviewinvoicessidebar, array, true     thisgttemplate[scripts]  arraycodeigniterjavascriptinvoicescreate.js     thisgttemplate[styles][]  codeigniterstylesinvoicescreate.css      thisgtdisplay  codepre

Negative 27969 pAll right. I asked a question looking for suggestions on here once, and I was told that wasnt allowed. I was told to state a specific problem, and ask for a specific answer. So as per moderator  instruction here I go.p  pI have two tables in my db. One table is nothing but several rows filled with different category options. Then on my other table there is a row called emcatem where one of the category terms found in the first row is stored.p  pI want to query out all of my category options from th table of nothing but categories as hyperlinks. Then based on the link chose run a query that looks something like thisp  precodeSELECT cat FROM categories WHERE categiorieschosen cat term codepre  pI have general knowledge in php so I could figure out how to do what I want with a point in the right direction. My specific problem is that I do not know what to look for. Can someone please tell me what to look for I have no problem with the query. My main problem is where would I point the hyperlink so it generates the page with the select statement upon request. What can I look for that will help me figure out how to do this i am very good at dissecting and figuring things out.p

Negative 27969 pIm trying to recreate a daily schedule view in a mobile website design.  The PC version looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuyJeK.png altenter image description herep  pIt will have several rows, and up to 5 or 6 columns.  I think a table will be best, but cant find the right CSSHTML to get this to work how I want.p  pI want the first column to have an auto width, to fit the content, and the rest to be equal evenly distributed.  The entire table will be 100 width.p  pI can get this by setting the column widths as follows 0 50 50   and not using codetablelayout fixedcode  The problem is, I cant have the width of any cells getting wider just because the content is too large.  If I use codetablelayout fixedcode, it keeps the cells the correct size, but the first column is 0 width, instead of autofit.  I tried placing the content inside each cell in a span or div and setting those to codewidth 100 overflow hiddencode, but I dont think the width 100 really works inside a table that isnt fixed.p  pIf I really have to, Ill set a fixed width for the first column, but Id like to avoid this because I dont want to use fixed font sizes  especially because this will be a mobile website, for smartphones and tablets.p  pI might be able to do something by using nested tables or floats... the first column not being part of the same table, but Im hoping there is a super clean solution Im missing, and I can keep all of this in a single table.p  pEDIT As requested, here is one version of my code that I have tried.

Negative 27969 pI cant get GPS location when creating portable WiFi hotspot through my device. Its running on Android 2.3.7. Basically my app fetches the GPS location of the device and sends it to a serverin LAN. To simulate this condition, I created a LAN with my mobile and Laptopacts as server. Hotspot is created through the mobile. It used to work if LAN is created by some other means, connectifiy or Router connection. Except a hotspot. I want to know if hotspot clashes with the GPS receiver. I seriously doubt it though.p

It looks like thisp  precodedef cycleiterable     saved  []     try           saved.appenditerable.next          yield saved[1]          isiter  True     except          saved  iterable          isiter  False      cycleABCD gt A B C D A B C D A B C D ...     for element in iterable         yield element         if isiter              saved.appendelement         What next codepre  pIf I could restart the generator, that would be perfect  I could send back a StopIteration, and then on the next gen.next, return entry 0 i.e. A B C D StopIteration A B C D StopIteration but it doesnt look like thats actually possible. p  pSecond would be that once StopIteration is hit, then saved has a cache. But it doesnt look like theres any way to get to the internal saved[] field. Maybe a class version of this p  p2 Or I could pass in the list directlyp  precodedef cycleiterable, saved[]     saved.clear     try           saved.appenditerable.next          yield saved[1]          isiter  True     except          saved  iterable          isiter  False      cycleABCD gt A B C D A B C D A B C D ...     for element in iterable         yield element         if isiter              saved.appendelement  mysaved  [] myiter  cyclesomeiter, mysaved codepre  pBut that just looks nasty. And in C I could pass in some reference, and change the actual reference to saved to point to iterable  you cant actually do that in python. So this doesnt even work.p  pOther options p  pEdit More data. The CachingIterable method appears to be too slow to be effective, but it did push me in a direction that might work.

Negative 27969 pI have been searching these threads and other sites but have not come across a way to do this both efficiently and memory friendly. And so, here is my storyp  pMy IOS iPad app uses sprite sheets a large image, such as 2k x 2k at 16 bpp, which is composed of many smaller sprites. I have created a sprite atlas class which manages these sheets, handle sprite animations, and other features.p  pThe idea in the load method is to load in the sheet from the file system, split it apart into UIImages one per sprite using CGImageCreateWithImageInRect, and then dispose of the loaded sheet. Seems simple enough.p  pNote that the sheet is loaded into a UIImage by initWithContentsOfFile or imageNamed more on that below.p  pThe desire is to save file memory by using sprite sheets, and then save runtime memory by only retaining the actual sprites themselves as UIImages. In my experiments thus far this is what I find happeningp  pIf I use initWithContentsOfFile I see from Instruments that it appears to do a file open, fstat64, and close for the file for EACH sprite in it. This takes an horrendous amount of time to load all the sprites. It actually seems to load the entire sheet, grab one sprite, close the sheet, then load the entire sheet again for the next sprite, until they are all created. Also it appears to consume lots of memory proven by the received memory warning after just the second sheet loaded, as well as by Instruments allocations.p  pNext I tried imageNamed which caches the sheet. The file loading occurs once and so it is MUCH faster. All seems good and in fact and I can go until many sheets are loaded. But eventually the dreaded received memory warning appears... and a few seconds later the app crashes. It appears to be the case that the cached image even though the pointer is set to null after pulling out the sprites never goes away. I have read several posts that also state this seems to be its behavior although other posts say other things, so that is not conclusive  does anyone know definitively.p  pAnd so it appears that neither method is what is needed. What I want is to load the file, pull out each sprite into its own UIImage, then have the UIImage for the big sheet file released completely.p  pI have read one site that talked about using the initWithContentsOfFile approach to set up their own caching system rather than trust the IOS plan with imageNamed so they can release the image when desired. However, I dont think they had sprite sheets in mind.p  pAnd so, I turn this over to the experts out there to see if there are some ideas on how to get both fast load times AND use minimal memory.p  p[and yes, I know that IOS 7 has SpriteKit. But this needs to also work on IOS 6.x.]p  pOne interesting data point is that on an original iPad the imageNamed version actually works fine with no received memory warning. It might have been IOS 5.x. But the app will crash on the iPad 2 device.p  pI am not including code here because what I am after is an understanding of the mechanics involved with how memory is used with these functions related to image handling.p  pAnd while I am at it, can someone please clarify this pointp  pTrue or False  When using CGImageCreateWithImageInRect, what it does is actually creates from new memory a bitmap the size of the rectangle specified and then COPIES from the original UIImage the pixels into this new memory as opposed to setting up the bitmap format and having a pointer point into the original UIImages pixel data. I think this is True, but want verification.p  pThanksp

Negative 27969 pThe issue I am faced with is that I need to prevent a Ruby class from being manipulated after it is defined. I can freeze it, but that doesnt stop people from just overwriting it all together. p  pI realize that some will want to respond with some sort of Ruby isnt meant to be used like this mantra. I get it, but my case is very special. This is for codewars.com where user submitted solutions are combined with a custom test framework, so I need to stop the usersubmitted code from tinkering with the Test class. p  pI had thought that it wasnt possible at all to make constants true constants, but I noticed that the  global variable is like this. Its likely that its because its builtin to the language to be like this and not something that can be done with custom variables. p
Negative 27969 pI have developed an Android application with Dropbox support which uses AccessType.DROPBOX to initialize its session, so I configured the app in the Dropbox developers console to be Full Dropbox.

This is where the problem stats  no matter what i input it still uses metric units and just seems to ignore my ifelifelse statments. so this is the first problem and i cant understand where i have gone wrong here.p  pafter that problem is solved, the bmi that it calculates needs to be put into a category and then the program should tell you which category your bmi fits into, this part doesnt even work for the metric bmi it just saysp  precode    this is the error i keep getting, the actual code for the program is below      traceback most recent call last      File CPython33bmi calculator 2 2 2 2.py, line 54, in ltmodulegt         catagorybmi      File CPython33bmi calculator 2 2 2 2.py, line 45, in catagory         if bmi lt18.5     TypeError unorderable types tuple lt float   this is a bmi calculator that works in both imperial and metric units and can tell your bmi category bmi   metric  metric Metric  Metric imperial  imperial Imperial  Imperial MetricBMI   ImperialBMI    answer  input  Do you want to work out you BMI using Metric or Imperial units    def BMI      metric  metric     Metric  Metric     imperial  imperial     Imperial  Imperial       if answer.lower  metric               printYou have chose to calculate your bmi in metric units         Weightkg  floatinputWhat is your weight in kilograms kg         Heightm  floatinputWhat is your height in meters m         bmi  WeightkgHeightmHeightm         printYour BMI is   strbmi      elif answer.lower  imperial         print You have chosen to calculate your bmi in imperial units         Weightlbs  floatinputWhat is your weight in pounds lbs         Heightinches  floatinputWhat is your height in inches         bmi  Weightlbs703HeightinchesHeightinches         print Your BMI is   strbmi     else         print please restart and enter either imperial or metric   BMI   def catagorybmi      if bmi lt18.5         return You are underweight     elif bmi gt18.5 and bmi lt25         return You are normal weight     elif bmi gt 25 and bmi lt30         return you are overweight     elif bmi gt30         return you are obese  catagorybmi codepre

All this is happening in a seperate main file. p  pThe form load codep  precodedocument.readyfunction          .evaluation.clickfunctionevent         event.preventDefault         var division  selecttmimata.propvalue         var action  .lesson select.propvalue         var table  .maincontent table         if table.length gt 0              table.fadeOut                  .maincontent.loadevaluationemployeeemployeeiddivisiontmimaampactionaction, function             alertsuccessfully retrieved evaluation form         .show       codepre  pSo it checkes if there is a previous loaded table in the maincontent and then it removes it and loads the form in the same div with class maincontent. After this outside the click function I catch the submit event for the formp  precode.evaluationform.submitfunction event     console.loginside form submit     var form  this     var tmimaid  selectdivisions.propvalue     var actionid  .action select.propvalue     data  form.serialize     ajax call to post the data     event.preventDefault  codepre  pI have placed preventDefault both at the top of submit and at the bottom as it is right now still the samep  pThe submit code is after the click function but inside the document.ready. But it wont work the form is submitted. I am betting it has to do that when the page loadsdocument.ready it doesnt see the form its not there it is loaded after a user clicks on a link so it doesnt chatch the submit event on the form correct Should I place the submit function inside the load callback functionp  psample html codep  precodeltsomewhere in the html file gt lta href classevaluationgtEvaluate employeeltagt ltdiv classmaincontentgtltdivgt codepre  pand the formp  precodeltform classevaluatonform action methodpostgt     ltform fields here gt    ltinput typesubmit namesubmit valueSave evaluation gt ltformgt codepre

The code is below and it works most of the time.  p  precode    HttpsURLConnection connection  null     try                  basic authentication         String encodedAuthString              DatatypeConverter.printBase64BinaryuserName    password                 .getBytes             connection  HttpsURLConnection url.openConnection         connection.setRequestMethodGET         connection.setRequestPropertyAuthorization, Basic   encodedAuthString          trywithresource to close connections when complete         tryInputStream in  connection.getInputStream             InputStreamReader isr  new InputStreamReaderin             int numCharsRead             char[] charArray  new char[1024]             StringBuffer sb  new StringBuffer             while numCharsRead  isr.readcharArray gt 0                  sb.appendcharArray, 0, numCharsRead                           jsonResult  sb.toString                     catch Exception e         throw e      finally          ifconnection null             connection.disconnect      codepre  pHowever, this code could be called several times in a single second by multiple threads although the actual containing method is synchronized, so only one thread can access the connection at a time.   In working with our network guys, we found that even though the application calls connection.disconnect the connection does not disconnect right away on the server.  We see the call to disconnect in the server logs, but the java application attempts to connect again before the server has completely disconnected resulting in a Connection Refused Error.p  pIs there anyway to force a full disconnect via java before connecting again or via a server setting when disconnect is called  Or a way to make it happen faster so the possibility for errors is reduced  I could retry the connection until it successfully connects, but that seems like a hack.p  pCan anyone help point me in the right directionp  pstrongUpdate  01062013strong  As I have continued investigating, I have found by reading the tcpdump that my client is connecting on the same port for 100 requests, then on the 101st request, the port changes and I get the error.  The connection will eventually recover and start sending and receiving requests on the new port, but it can take up to a minute to recover.  I have included the tcpdump below.  You can see that when the client sends on the new port, the destination ip returns a Reset on the new port.   Because of this, I am thinking the error is a result of an error at the destination and not from my client but I am still trying to verify since my understanding at this level is limited.p  precode132025.925760 IP DESTINATIONIP.https gt CLIENTIP.53321 P 197809197846... 132025.925819 IP CLIENTIP.53321 gt DESTINATIONIP.https . ack 197846 wi... 132025.926393 IP CLIENTIP.53321 gt DESTINATIONIP.https P 82874829113... 132025.926424 IP CLIENTIP.53321 gt DESTINATIONIP.https F 82911829110... 132025.928629 IP CLIENTIP.53322 gt DESTINATIONIP.https S 702514925702... 132026.005902 IP DESTINATIONIP.https gt CLIENTIP.53321 . ack 82911 win... 132026.008461 IP DESTINATIONIP.https gt CLIENTIP.53322 R 000 ack 70... 132026.011274 IP DESTINATIONIP.https gt CLIENTIP.53321 P 197846197883... 132026.011290 IP CLIENTIP.53321 gt DESTINATIONIP.https R 494623963494... 132026.011300 IP DESTINATIONIP.https gt CLIENTIP.53321 F 197883197883... 132026.011305 IP CLIENTIP.53321 gt DESTINATIONIP.https R 494623963494... codepre

Negative 27969 pIn my MVC4 project, I am trying to insert some data, that I populated from an excel worksheet, into database Oracle 10g DB using 12c ODAC by using EF5.p  pStoryp  pemFirst I read data from excel and then convert them to entities. However excel data has no Primary Key ID column I DONT HAVE CONTROL OVER EXCEL DATA. Therefore for every row in excel first I am searching DB for a match. If there is a match I am getting the matched entity by using the DbContext. In this case my instantiated classentity has ID property filled.emp  pemOn the other hand, if there is no match in the DB I am instantiating a new class of entity type without an ID information. If entity exists in more than one row of excel worksheet then my final List would have more than one instance of the same entity each have ID  0.emp  pemAfter populating the data I add my entities to my DbContext one by one and call SaveChanges method of the context. Then when I check the Database I see that different instances of the same class getting different IDs, but this is not what I want.emp  pemI understand why this is happening since DbContext cannot relate different instances of a class if the PK is not set. All entitiess EntityState becomes Added emp  pMy question isp  pstrongIs there a way to tell Entity Framework that if all the properties of an entity are equal to each other ampamp the PKID is not set treat these entities as same entities when inserting into databasestrong.p  pSimplifiedp  pAfter executing MyMethod in below code, I want only one row of data created in my database Tablep  precode I implemented IEquatable to see if it works for EF I heard it works in NHibernate but unfortunately not working. public class MyEntity IEquatableltMyEntitygt       This is an autoincrementing PK in DB     public int ID  get set      public string Name  get set       public bool EqualsMyEntity other              if other  null return false         if ReferenceEqualsthis, other return true          return Equalsthis.ID, other.ID ampamp Equalsthis.Name, other.Name           public override bool Equalsobject obj              return Equalsobj as MyEntity           public override int GetHashCode              unchecked                      var result  this.ID.GetHashCode             result  result  397  this.Name null  this.Name.GetHashCode  0             return result                 public void MyMethod      DbContext db  new DbContext      db.MyEntity.Addnew MyEntity  Name  Foo   ID0 initially.     db.MyEntity.Addnew MyEntity  Name  Foo   ID0 initially.

Negative 27969 p[CLARIFIED QUESTION] Try to imagine that you are building some clone of facebookwe can call it clonebook from scratch, and you are the only developer working on it. To minimize time and efforts you want to do moreless the same coding for the web access and for the installable packages. Here you need to consider two main points, the clonebook use it at the web, on desktopsso we need to consider even internet explorer, firefox, etc... and mobilesusually webkit. Here you dont usually use the camera to upload pictures but the filemanager and you use the emails or alias for your contacts.p  pThe second point is the installable app, where you add the access to the phone camera to upload de picture, plubic news on clonebook in your wall in facebookapp, twitterapp, etc...

Perhaps suggesting too many actionbar icons.p  precodeOverride     public boolean onCreateOptionsMenuMenu menu           Inflate the menu this adds items to the action bar if it is present.         getMenuInflater.inflateR.menu.dressingroom, menu         return true          Override     public boolean onOptionsItemSelectedMenuItem item          int itemId  item.getItemId          switch itemId              case R.id.menufemaleHat   addClothesR.id.menufemaleHat                      break             case R.id.menufemalePants  addClothesR.id.menufemalePants                      break             case R.id.menufemaleTop  addClothesR.id.menufemaleTop                      break             case R.id.menumaleHat  addClothesR.id.menumaleHat                      break             case R.id.menumalePants  addClothesR.id.menumalePants                      break             case R.id.menumaleTop  addClothesR.id.menumaleTop                      break             case R.id.menuMaleHair  addClothesR.id.menuMaleHair                      break             case R.id.menuFemaleHair  addClothesR.id.menuFemaleHair                      break             case R.id.menuMaleAccessories  addClothesR.id.menuMaleAccessories                      break             case R.id.menuFemaleAccessories  addClothesR.id.menuFemaleAccessories                      break             case R.id.actionsave saveClicked cropImage                      break             case R.id.actioncancel goToStartScreen cropImage                      break             case R.id.uniformScale                 changeAnisotropicitem                     break             case R.id.rotation                 changeRotateitem                     break             default Log.dwrong menu,Invalid option                      break                  return super.onOptionsItemSelecteditem      codepre  pp  precodeltitem     androidididmenusticker         androidshowAsActionalways         androidicondrawableicactionadd         androidtitleAdd Stickergt         ltmenugt     ltitem         androidididmenumale         androidshowAsActionalways         androidtitleMalegt         ltmenugt         ltitem             androidididmenuaddclothes             androidtitleAdd Clothesgt             ltmenugt                 ltitem                 androidididmenumaleHat                 androidtitleHatgt                 ltitem                 androidididmenumaleTop                 androidtitleTopgt                 ltitem                 androidididmenumalePants                 androidtitlePantsgt             ltmenugt         ltitemgt         ltitem         androidididmenuMaleAccessories         androidshowAsActionalways         androidtitleAdd Accessoriesgt         ltitemgt         ltitem             androidididmenuMaleHair             androidshowAsActionalways             androidtitleAdd Hairgt         ltitemgt         ltmenugt     ltitemgt     ltitem         androidididmenufemale         androidshowAsActionalways         androidtitleFemalegt         ltmenugt         ltitem             androidididmenuaddclothes             androidtitleAdd Clothesgt             ltmenugt                 ltitem                 androidididmenufemaleHat                 androidtitleHatgt                 ltitem                 androidididmenufemaleTop                 androidtitleTopgt                 ltitem                 androidididmenufemalePants                 androidtitlePantsgt             ltmenugt         ltitemgt         ltitem         androidididmenuFemaleAccessories         androidshowAsActionalways         androidtitleAdd Accessoriesgt         ltitemgt         ltitem             androidididmenuFemaleHair             androidshowAsActionalways             androidtitleAdd Hairgt         ltitemgt         ltmenugt     ltitemgt     ltmenugt  ltitemgt      ltitem         androidididactionsettings         androidshowAsActionalways         androidtitleSticker Settings         androidicondrawableicactiongeargt             ltgroup androidcheckableBehaviorallgt                 ltitem androidididuniformScale                     androidtitleEnable Resizing                     androidcheckedtrue gt                 ltitem androidididrotation                     androidtitleEnable Rotation                     androidcheckedfalse gt             ltgroupgt     ltitemgt      ltitem         androidididactionsave         androidshowAsActionalways         androidtitlestringactionsave         androidicondrawableicactionsavegt     ltitemgt      ltitem         androidididactioncancel         androidshowAsActionalways         androidtitleCancel         androidicondrawableicactioncancelgt     ltitemgt codepre  pp

Negative 27969 pam working on developing a python toolbox to automate the steps required for checking data out and back into a file geodatabase. My question is what is the best way to limit the features checked out to only those selected while using the python command line and ArcPad Data Management tools instead of the ArcPad data manager The Only get selected features checkbox in the ArcPad Data Manager makes it easy. This is important because I want to limit the areas of use and reduce the file size as one of the feature classes is a large parcel map. p

Negative 27969 pSo the question is exactly what the subject header says. Im following a libdgx tutorial and the guy is putting a 1d textureRegion array into a 2d textureRegion array. The line of code is as followsp  precodeTextureRegion[][] temp  TextureRegion.splitsheet, 16, 16 codepre  pCurrently, my take on it is this A codeTexturecode is just an image. While a codespritecode is rectangular entity with a texture mapped to it. And a codeTextureRegion[][]code takes an entire spriteSheet and can locate a specific sprite you want to use. p  pSo effectively, hes created a way for us to make sprites just off the 2d textureRegion array Just need clarification, thanks. p

Negative 27969 pi have got a seriously annoying bug that is causing me issues on a hrefhttpwww.topshop.comentsukcategorylookofthedaymonikhfebruary20142692703homeTS1392299039147ampintcmpidWHEROWELOVEUKWK25PSLOOKFEATUREMONIKHLFW relnofollowthis pagea, but only on Safari 6.1 on a Mac. I am using the videojs library to do video detection and fallback into Flash on older browsers. The videojs library adds a play button to the DOM for each video when it initialises, that you can click to start the video playing. It also helpfully adds strongvjspausedstrong and strongvjsplayingstrong to the video container depending on its state, and i am using these to hide the play button when the video is playing.p  pOn all other browsers than Safari 6.1 this works fine, but in this browser the first video plays ok but any subsequent videos on the page still show the play button over the top of video when started which is very ugly. The most annoying this is that if i open up the dev tools and untick the display none styling then retick it, it suddenly works fine. It is like giving the browser a poke and it suddenly realizing hey, im not supposed to be showing this id better hide it quick.p  pIf anyone can offer me any pointers on what is causing this id really appreciate it as i am going crazy trying to figure it out.p  pThanksp  pedit  Finally figured this one out, thought id leave the answer here in  case anyone was experiencing the same issues as me. It occurs when multiple instances of the videojs script are loaded onto the page. They end up conflicting with each other. Hope this helps anyone with the same issues i had.

Negative 27969 pI want to create a cache in my web application, which will allow the top layer MVC to persist some values, retrieved from underlying layers services amp DB, in order to avoid  unnecessary requests to it. The data, that I want to store in cache, is needed on every page of the web site, so this cache is aimed to dramatically reduce the amount of requests. The idea is that a lot of threads will read the data from collection while one thread will clear it and retrieve new data after cache expiration. This means the collection will be used for strongfrequent readingstrong and strongrare writingstrong operations.  p  pThe problem for me is to choose the appropriate class for these purposes. I have read about the set of concurrent classes from a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.collections.concurrent28vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowcodeSystem.Collections.Concurrentcodea, introduced in .NET 4. I definitely dont need to use codeConcurrentQueuecode or codeConcurrentStackcode, but I have to choose between a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comrurulibrarydd26731228vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowcodeBlockingCollectioncodea, a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd38177928vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowcodeConcurrentBagcodea and a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd28719128vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowcodeConcurrentDictionarycodea.  p  pcodeConcurrentBagcode seems to be the best solution in this case. However, I read in a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combpfxteamarchive201001269953725.aspx relnofollowthis articlea that concurrent dictionaryp  blockquote   p... is entirely lockfree for read operations.  In this way, its optimized for scenarios where reading from the dictionary is the most frequent operation.p blockquote  pSo maybe the best solution is to use codeConcurrentDictionaryltint, MyTypeOfObjgtcode instead Or maybe I dont need concurrent type at all and simple codeListcode will do the job Probably, it would do if I can somehow lock operations with it for the time of cache update. But using simple codelockcode is undesirable.p  pAny advices and explanations are appreciated.p  h1Updateh1  pThe cache is used to store the map points of the outlets. The set of outlets is quite stable, but there should be a UI to add them, so insert operations are really rare. It might be even easier to retrieve whole collection from the underlying layer after timeout then perform insert operations. Search is not required as well, reading means simple enumeration.p

Negative 27969 pI have answered with my own implementation below, where Id appreciate if you could check the maths and logic, but I realise there are other possibilities as well.p  hr  pIm trying to generate 32 random characters to be used in a registration URL.p  pThe new account is partially created by a member of staff setting the nameemail, and a plain text email is sent to the new user so they can confirm their email address and set their password.p  pTrying to keep to [AZaz09] characters, I believe this creates a base 62 system, taking just under 6 bits to store... which is just over 190 bits of entropy or 190.53428193238p  pAs this is a security feature, I dont believe codeuniqidcode alone is a good idea, as this is based on the current microtime.p  pAnd I dont believe using encryption or hashing of the users ID or email address is a good solution either collisions, low entropy, and presumably secured by a single key.p

Negative 27969 pthis is the best way I can think of doing this. Could you give me so hints as to whether this is the correct way or if there is a more efficient way of doing it.p  pMy situation is Each time the frame is Updateed Like in XNA I want to check if something has happened.. Like if the timer for that screen has been running for over 2000 milliseconds. But I only want it to fire once, not every time the frame is updated. This would cause a problemp  precodeiftotalMilliseconds gt 2000      this.Fader.FadeIn  codepre  pSo I came up with this method that I have implemented in the GameScreen class that looks like thisp  precodepublic bool RunOncestring Alias, bool IsTrue      if this.Bools.ContainsKeyAlias         this.Bools.AddAlias, false      if IsTrue ampamp this.Bools[Alias]              this.Bools[Alias]  true         return true          else         return false  codepre  pThis basically checks if the passed if statement boolean is true, if it is then it fires once and not again unless the Bool[Alias] is set back to false. I use it like thisp  precodeifthis.RunOncefadeInStarted, totalMilliseconds gt 2000      this.Fader.FadeIn  codepre  pThis will then only run one time and I think is quite easily readable codewise.p  pThe reason I have posted this is for two reasons.. Firstly because I wanted to show how I have overcome the problem as it may be of some help to others who had the same problem.. And secondly to see if I have missed an obvious way of doing this without creating a manual method for it, or if it could be done more efficiently.p

Negative 27969 pI have a node.js file which has methods that read and write from my heroku postgresql database. I am using the pg module in order to access the DB. My problem is that calling my getSleepMode function more than once in a row causes the ECONNRESET error. This function simply sends a query to my DB and retrieves an integer.

Negative 27969 pI have an app where it records via AudioRecord  and play sounds at the same time via  playint soundID, float leftVolume, float rightVolume, int priority, int loop, float ratep  pThe AudioRecord will last about a minute, and during this there will be several short sounds from SoundPool lasting about 2 seconds each. All sounds are preloaded.p  pAnd everything works as expected on devices such as e.g. Galaxy S3 Nexus 7 device. But when testing the exact same code on an LGP875 probably as modern as other 2 devices and running Android 4.1, I get the message Dont play soundPool because of a recording. This comes from a SoundPool filter.p  pThe same code for SoundPool, without also recording, running on a LGP875, plays sounds fine. It is just an issue with playing SoundPool and recording on a LG phone.p  pId appreciate any ideas or directions to take to find a workaround  find root source of issue. I expect there are many devices similar to LGP875 where this error occurs.p  pThanks.p

Negative 27969 pSummarizing my code, I have a codeIRepositoryltEgtcode that uses a codeDbContextStrategyltEgtcode.p  pcodeDbContextStrategyltEgtcode extends from codeDbContextcode and uses a codeDbSetltEgtcode for LINQ operations on the database.p  pcodeEcode is just an entity type passed by generics.p  pIn my Web API controller I am using this repository interface to fetch my resources.p  pHowever, some entities depend on other entities. And in codePUTcode or codePOSTcode requests for example, I should validate input foreign keys to check if they are valid.p  pAs a result, I would need to instantiate a new codeIRepositoryltXgtcode where codeXcode is the foreign entity type.p  pIn order for me to make my development as easy as possible, I generated a layer of embase classesem that will handle configuration, cache, dependency injection and HTTP method binding for me.p  pIn my least child controller I have the following methodp  precode Base class provides me with the Season entity fetched from the database.

The base controller will call it, and then call the coderepository.Editentitycode which will update the entity in the codeDbContextcode. After the operation, the codeIRepositoryltSeasongtcode is disposed.p  pValidateShow is a private method that just checks if a codeshowIdcode existsp  precodeprivate async Taskltboolgt ValidateShowint id        This will instantiate a new IRepositoryltTVShowgt, and therefore a new DbContext      return await UseAsyncDependencyltTVShow, boolgtasync showRepo gt            return await showRepo.ReadAsyncid  null         codepre  pHowever, the codeValidateShowcode method just stays in an infinite loop. I have debugged the method, and the call gets correctly delegated to the codeDbSetltTVShowgtcode and the loop happens at codecontext.Entities.FindAsynckeyscode.p  pThe method works ok, because I used the same codeReadAsynccode method to fetch the codeSeasoncode entity.p  pBut it appears that it generates some kind of deadlock when there are two different codeDbContextcode open. codeDbSetltSeasongtcode and codeDbSetltTVShowgtcodep  pI should note that both codeDbContextcode connects to the same database.p  h1Async  Await execution flow from IRepository to DbSeth1  pcodeIRepositoryltEgtcode calls the codeSelectAsynckeyscode method on an codeIDaoltEgtcode, which calls the codeSelectAsynckeyscode method on codeDbContextStrategyltEgtcode.p  pHere is the code tracep  pstrongDefaultRepository  IRepositorystrongp  precodepublic async TaskltEgt ReadAsyncparams object[] keys      ifkeys  null  keys.Length lt 1 return null     return await dao.SelectAsynckeys  codepre  pstrongDefaultDao  IDaostrongp  precodepublic async TaskltEgt SelectAsyncparams object[] keys      return await ForEachStrategyAsyncasync strategy gt          return await strategy.SelectAsynckeys     , entity gt          return entity  null        private async TaskltRgt ForEachStrategyAsyncltRgtFuncltIPersistenceStrategyltEgt, TaskltRgtgt function,                                               FuncltR, boolgt assertion       R lastResult  defaultR     foreachIPersistenceStrategyltEgt strategy in strategies           lastResult  await functionstrategy          ifassertionlastResult break          return lastResult  codepre  pstrongDbContextStrategy  IPersistenceStrategystrongp  precodepublic async TaskltEgt SelectAsyncparams object[] keys      return await context.Entities.FindAsynckeys  codepre
Negative 27969 pMy HTML form includes a series of five related codeltinput typetext gtcode tags, all of which need to be singledigit or twodigit numbers. Ive created a JavaScript function that will test userinput against a regular expression using an ifelse statement. The function works as desired when input is valid however, I would like to have the focus remain on the inputfield if input is invalid, and so far I havent been able to make that happen.p  pIve tried using codedocument.getElementByIdcurrseg.focuscode  where codecurrsegcode is dynamically set to the ID of the offending inputfield. Ive also tried using a codeswitchcode statement with an individual codecasecode for each possible bad inputfield, and with the ID of the offending field specified directly rather than calculated as a variable.p  pValidation testing is prompted by an codeonblurcode event Ive also tried using the codeonchangecode event for each inputfield. I have an codealertBad user inputcode in the codeelsecode condition, so I know the function is flowing properly to the codeelsecode condition when input is invalid, but focus moves to the next inputfield.p  pEverything Ive tried fails to stop the progress of the focus, whether I move from the inputfield by mouseaction or by tabkey.p  pAny suggestions how I can keep focus on a field with invalid inputp

Negative 27969 pIs there a way in VB.netVBA to search for a string in a .doc file without physically opening itp  pThe question may sound silly but I have code that searches 100s of documents at a time while opening them all up onebyone using codeFor Eachcode, codeFileSystemObjectcodeand codeoWord.Document.OpenFilename.doccode and it takes ages. p  pI noticed that when you search for a document using the search box in Windows Explorer, the results are returned having found your search term in the TITLE of the document as well as the the CONTENTS of the document within the search window. The results where the search term was found INSIDE the document appears as a sort of text preview of all the text inside that document.I could be wrong but I read somewhere that all word documents contain some sort of xml file embedded within that contains among other things the text from the document itself.p  pSo my question is, if Windows Explorer can do it without having to open a word process, can the same be done in code VBA or VB.NETto find a particular word inside a documentp  pHope that makes sense, p  pThanks.p
Negative 27969 pIm trying to implement a undoredo function in a super simple text editor, as a project.

With this, I call execute from codeMoveLeftcode, and then push the interaction back onto codeundoStackcode Here are both functionsp  precode else if interaction.type  UserInteractionTypeundo                      try                              interaction.commandgtundoeditor                 redoStack.pushundoStack.top                 undoStack.pop                 view.clearErrorMessage              catch EditorExceptionamp e                              view.showErrorMessagee.getReason                          view.refresh             delete interaction.command  delete command since we stored it in the stack                  else if interaction.type  UserInteractionTyperedo                      try                              interaction  redoStack.top                 interaction.commandgtexecuteeditor                 undoStack.pushinteraction                 view.clearErrorMessage                          catch EditorExceptionamp e                              view.showErrorMessagee.getReason                          view.refresh          codepre  pRight now Im getting Segmentation fault core dumped at this line in undop  blockquote   pinteraction.commandundoeditorp blockquote  pAnd if I just test redo, I get a segmentation fault at this linep  blockquote   pinteraction  redoStack.topp blockquote  pBoth are the first line after the try statement.

Negative 27969 pIn Chrome Dev Tools, when viewing the Network tab, is it possible to select a script and open it in the Sources tab Doubleclicking the script opens it raw in a new browser tab.p  pBecause the Sources tab organizes all assets by their source domains along with folder paths, it can be time consuming to locate a particular script, if you dont know immediately where it came from. You have to switch back and forth between Network and Sources, taking note of the domain and folder path in the scripts header and then trying to dig through all the source domains and subfolders until you locate the script.p  pIt seems like there should be some obvious way of opening a script in the Sources tab from the Network tab, but I dont see how. You appear to have to manually dig to find it.p

So for example, to access the URL codehttpsmyapi.example.comdocscode or codehttpsmyapi.example.comapidocscode I will need to provide a username and password, and to make a successful call to codehttpsmyapi.example.commyresource1code I will need to send the header codeAuthorization Bearer lttokengtcode in the request with a valid access token.p  pThis setup works as expected, except through Swagger UI. The Try it out functionality breaks by sending the wrong authorization header. Instead of receiving a header of the form codeAuthorization Bearer lttokengtcode, the server is receiving codeAuthorization Basic ltvaluegtcode with the credentials used to access the documentation page.p  pWorth mentioning, the Swagger UI setup for the header looks like thisp  precodewindow.authorizations.addkey, new ApiKeyAuthorization     Authorization, Bearer   key, header,  codepre  pThis works when running Swagger UI locally, but breaks when running against the Nginx server. Also, everything works if I remove the second location from the Nginx configuration loosing Basic auth on codedocscode and codeapidocscode.p
Negative 27969 pI currently have my SQL server database on my local PC which I have connected to a website that I am developing.

Negative 27969 pI see that Viewbix, Voo Player, JW player, Covert Player, HeroCaster, etc all essentially us JS to call out to their server which then contains the code which is used to display the player itself... which then taps into the Youtube api to grab the stream.  Customization of the player is all done on their server.

Looking at Kaltura, MediaElementjs, etc.  A bit confused by some of the documentation.  Kaltura doesnt indicate anywhere if its player elements could be used to embed YT.  I understand its fairly easy to customize appearance of MediaElementjs, but not clear whether the framework is there to add more complex functionality later that can be shared on FB with optin forms and such inside a shareable embed player.p  pDocs from a couple years back about SublimeVideo Horizon or Framework look ideal, but as far as I can tell its all been abandoned.  Thats really what I want though... open source tools or ideally a coherent toolkit to help me build the player, host it, add customization, then start adding more advanced functionality optin forms, social buttons, etc.  I am aware that there are players that have many of these functions, but none do quite what I want, and all stop working if I choose another provider later, so I really would like to roll my own.p  pIs there an existing solution to do this  A toolkit Ive missed  If not hoping someone with more experience in development of such tools can help me choose the best framework to dig into and provide a few pointers.p

Im only actually switching on the codetcode parameter, and I actually want to be completely polymorphic in codefcode and codezcode theyre only class parameters because the instances need to instantiate codercode in terms of them.p  pOriginally I tried this with type families the class had only a single parameter codetcode, and the role of codercode was taken by an associated type. The problem I had with that and many other variations was that even when I could get it to accept the class and instances, applying it to more than one argument failed with ambiguous type variables. I believe this was because I wasnt communicating to haskell that I was using the same codefcode all the way through.p  pIs it possible to get back to simpler types for codedApplycode while still keeping the codeunFunc  fa  fb  fccode usagep  pMy ultimate goal is to use this to make a type class that encompasses embothem codeApplicativecode and codeDivisiblecode given a pair of functions codefunc  a gt b gt c gt zcode and codeunFunc  z gt a, b, c, code it should be possible to make a function codef a gt f b gt f cgt f zcode knowing only that codefcode is either covariant or contravariant, without knowing which.

MIDIHDR hdr hdr.this  that ...  midiStreamRestarthms midiOutPrepareHeaderhms, amphdr, sizeofMIDIHDR  sizeofMIDIHDR  64 midiStreamOuthms, amphdr, sizeofMIDIHDR  wait for an event that is set from the midi callback when the playback has finished WaitForSingleObject... midiOutUnprepareHeaderhms, amphdr, sizeofMIDIHDR codepre  pThe above calling sequence works and produces no errors error checks have been omitted for readability.p  pFor the purpose of using those in C, I have created some PInvoke codep  precode[DllImportwinmm.dll] public static extern int midiOutPrepareHeaderIntPtr handle, ref MidiHeader header, uint headerSize [DllImportwinmm.dll] public static extern int midiOutUnprepareHeaderIntPtr handle, ref MidiHeader header, uint headerSize [DllImportwinmm.dll] public static extern int midiStreamOutIntPtr handle, ref MidiHeader header, uint headerSize [DllImportwinmm.dll] public static extern int midiStreamRestartIntPtr handle  [StructLayoutLayoutKind.Sequential] public struct MidiHeader      public IntPtr Data     public uint BufferLength     public uint BytesRecorded     public IntPtr UserData     public uint Flags     public IntPtr Next     public IntPtr Reserved     public uint Offset      [MarshalAsUnmanagedType.ByValArray, SizeConst  8]     public IntPtr[] Reserved2      public IntPtr Reserved0     public IntPtr Reserved1     public IntPtr Reserved2     public IntPtr Reserved3     public IntPtr Reserved4     public IntPtr Reserved5     public IntPtr Reserved6     public IntPtr Reserved7  codepre  pThe call sequence is the same as in Cp  precodevar hdr  new MidiHeader hdr.this  that midiStreamRestarthandle midiOutPrepareHeaderhandle, ref header, headerSize  headerSize  64 midiStreamOuthandle, ref header, headerSize mre.WaitOne  wait until the midi playback has finished. midiOutUnprepareHeaderhandle, ref header, headerSize codepre  pMIDI output works and the code produces no error error checks are again omitted.p  pAs soon as I uncomment the two lines with the array in codeMidiHeadercode, and instead remove the codeReserved0code to codeReserved7code fields, it doesnt work anymore. What happens is the followingp  pEverything is normal until and including codemidiStreamOutcode. I can hear the midi output. The playback length is correct. However, the event callback is never called when the playback ends.p  pAt this point the value of codeMidiHeader.Flagscode is code0xecode, indicating that the stream is still playing even though the callback has been notified with the message that playback has finished. The value of codeMidiHeader.Flagscode should be code9code, indicating that the stream has finished playing.p  pThe call to codemidiOutUnprepareHeadercode fails with the error code code0x41code Cannot perform this operation while media data is still playing.  Reset the device, or wait until the data is finished playing.. Note that resetting the device, as suggested in the error message, does in fact not fix the problem neither does waiting or trying it multiple times.p  pAnother variant that works correctly is if I use codeIntPtrcode instead of coderef MidiHeadercode in the signatures of the C declarations, and then manually allocate unmanaged memory, copying my codeMidiHeadercode structure onto that memory, and then using the allocated memory to call the functions.p  pFurthermore, I tried decreasing the size Im passing to the codeheaderSizecode argument to 32. Since the fields are reserved and, in fact, didnt exist in previous version of the Windows API, they seemed to have no particular purpose anyway. However, this does not fix the problem, even though Windows should not even know that the array exists, and therefore it should not do anything. Commenting out the array entirely yet again fixes the problem i.e., both the array as well as the 8 codeReservedcode fields are commented out, and the codeheaderSizecode is 32.p  pThis hints to me that the codeIntPtr[] Reserved2code cannot be marshaled correctly, and attempting to do so is corrupting other values. To verify that, I have created a Platform Invoke test projectp  precodeWIN32PROJECT1API void stdcall testfunctionstruct teststructt s      printfu u u u u u u un, sgttest0, sgttest1, sgttest2, sgttest3, sgttest4, sgttest5, sgttest6, sgttest7     for int i  0 i lt sizeofsgtpointerarray  sizeofsgtpointerarray[0] i              printfu , uint32tsgtpointerarray[i] gtgt 16          printfn   typedef int32t testptr  struct teststructt      testptr test0     uint32t test1     uint32t test2     testptr test3     uint32t test4     testptr test5     uint32t test6     uint32t test7     testptr pointerarray[8]  codepre  pWhich is called from Cp  precode[StructLayoutLayoutKind.Sequential] struct TestStruct      public IntPtr test0     public uint test1     public uint test2     public IntPtr test3     public uint test4     public IntPtr test5     public uint test6     public uint test7     [MarshalAsUnmanagedType.ByValArray, SizeConst  8]     public IntPtr[] pointerarray   [DllImportWin32Project1.dll] static extern void testfunctionref TestStruct s  static void Mainstring[] args      TestStruct s  new TestStruct     s.test0  IntPtr.Zero     s.test1  1     s.test2  2     s.test3  IntPtr.AddIntPtr.Zero, 3     s.test4  4     s.test5  IntPtr.AddIntPtr.Zero, 5     s.test6  6     s.test7  7     s.pointerarray  new IntPtr[8]     for int i  0 i lt s.pointerarray.Length i              s.pointerarray[i]  IntPtr.AddIntPtr.Zero, i ltlt 16          testfunctionref s      Console.ReadLine  codepre  pAnd the output is as expected, hence the marshaling of the codeIntPtr[] pointerarraycode worked in this program.p  pemI am aware that not using codeSafeHandlecode is suboptimal, however, when using that, the behavior of the MIDI functions when using the array is even weirder, so I chose to maybe tackle one problem at a time.emp  pWhy does using codeIntPtr[] Reserved2code cause an errorp  hr  pstrongHere is some more code to produce a complete examplestrongp  pC Codep  precode  example9.c    Created on Dec 21, 2011       Author David J.

Negative 27969 pI have a Django form that could have multiple fields of the same name added via javascript. In my view, using QueryDict.getlist I am able to process all of these identical fields into a list. Works fine. p  pBut, if form.isvalid comes back false bc one of the fields is blank, the data that was submitted by the user is not repopulated into the form. And I dont think it can be because the form the user was working on had multiple fields with the same name, so how can Django know what to put where One thought was to send the list of values to the template and attempt to recreate the form in the template by processing the list, but this is a big pain in the butt.   p  pI have not submitted code because my code works, its just that it seems there is no way to have Django bind the POST data back to the form in this case if isvalid is false. Is this a correct conclusion on my part Or is there something in the Forms API that could help me here p

The code resulted from painstakingly boiling down a large program to the bare minimum needed to manifest the problem.p  pThe following code in my SKScene creates three sprites and displays one, but uses a shader to display the texture of one of the other sprites thats passed in as a uniform.  p  precode    SKSpriteNode background  [[SKSpriteNode alloc] initWithImageNamedbackground]     SKSpriteNode piece1  [[SKSpriteNode alloc] initWithImageNamedpiece1]     SKSpriteNode piece2  [[SKSpriteNode alloc] initWithImageNamedpiece2]      SKShader shader  [SKShader shaderWithFileNamedtest.fsh]     [shader addUniform[SKUniform uniformWithNameu1 texturebackground.texture]]     [shader addUniform[SKUniform uniformWithNamepiece1Texture texturepiece1.texture]]     [shader addUniform[SKUniform uniformWithNameu2 float0.0]]     [shader addUniform[SKUniform uniformWithNameu3 float0.0]]      piece2.shader  shader     [self addChildpiece2] codepre  pHeres the shaderp  precodevoid mainvoid      glFragColor  texture2Dpiece1Texture, vtexcoord  codepre  pInstead of showing piece2, the shader should show piece1.

Why is this true and what does this mean  In my real shader, I have uniforms that may not be accessed due to ifconditions and user behavior.  p  pIs that okay  Or, do I need to artificially access every uniform just in case some wouldnt be accessedp  pI understand that the SKShader doc is a preliminary document but the behavior is so unexpected, I cant help but wonder if there needs to be more explanation.

Negative 27969 pThe first part here is the display of the grid in a section and form. They are able to export this grid to Excel or Crystal Reports. Ive included the gridOptions that help build the grid and the columnDefs that are a big part of the gridOptions. There is a definition for every column and Ive used the max data in each column to decide the size of the column. This dictates the size of the whole grid, but the container still fits into the viewable area. There is a horizontal scroll. The only problem I have is that this is only activated when the window is resized. Maximize, minimize, resize, change in any way and the grid will fit like it is supposed to perfectly. Otherwise the container does not stop in the viewable area like it is supposed to, it extends all the way around the width of the grid.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3NOHJ.png altFits after window resizep  pHas anyone run into anything like this anymore Id be happy if I just have to run something through interval with 0 if thats what it takes, but this is very buggy behavior. This is a good amount of code, but the angular, bootstrap, and bootstrap ui is recent and standard. UIGrid is RC20 uigrid  v3.0.0rc.20746a476  20150319.

Negative 27969 pI wrote a strongC console programstrong that displays a menu with several options for the user, one of them goes into a continuous loop and the condition to exit the loop is GetAsyncKeyStateVKESCAPE.

Negative 27969 pIm owkring on a project for golfstatistics. Right now I made it so far to enter and edit golfstatistics. Im working with laravel 5 btw. My database schema works like this  Every round you play saves one entry in the round table with information like date, playid, weather, courseid  for every hole played an entry in the score table is made. There I have a reference to the roundid and information like score, fairwayhit, greenhit, putts, penalties, ....p  pNo I want to create reports where I can filter for date and course etc. What I did for now is. I created a Statistic class where I can pass the date, playerid, roundid, courseid in the construct. The construct will querie all the rounds played, matching those filters. Then, foreach statistic I made a public function ex. scoringaverage, greenhitpercantage, puttsperround, puttspergreeninregulation etc. there are about 15 stats. So my question is is that right what Im doing here because I have about 15 functions just to calculate statistics. Please give me some advice if you have a better solution.p  pThank youp

Negative 27969 pThis is a fairly simple accessibility question.p  pSay we have a toggle linkbutton which, when clicked, toggles the mobile menu.

Unfortunately, I cannot find that article again.p  pFolks always say to separate logic from content. My answer is do you really think your Javascript codeshowMenucode function will work without that link to trigger it So, are you emreallyem separating logic from contentp  pAlong those lines, I do like the idea of using event handlers to attach events, however, this makes the code strongharderstrong to maintain in certain circumstances, not easier. If I later delete that link or change the ID or class, I will lose the functionality. The codeonclickcode attribute reminds me to tread carefully. If I have more than one link, or wish to be 508 compliant see next paragraph, I will use an event handler.p  pThe 508 standard demands that every onclick attribute be accompanied by an equivalent keyboard attribute. This drives me nuts, because keyboard users can trigger an onclick event through the  key, and are used to doing so for text links. In addition, if you DO add an onkeyup event handler of any sort, you need to filter for the  key, etc. so that users dont get stuck on your link and become completely unable to browse throughout the rest of the site.p  pSee note a hrefhttpalistapart.comarticlepopuplinkssection6 relnofollowhttpalistapart.comarticlepopuplinkssection6ap  pstrongMy questionsstrongp  ol liIs a codeltbuttongtcode tag better for accessibility li liWhy or why notli liWhich of the 4 is the best for accessibilityli ol  pPlease note that this question is similar to the following question, but I am much more interested in the codeltbuttongtcode vs. codeltagtcode argument.

Negative 27969 pI am building a GUI in Python and using threads to generate multiple countdown timers that work independently. I have a minimized module for testing which i am including bellow. I want the button to start the count down and then when its clicked again stop it, then reset so that it can be started on the next click. Also reset on its own once time runs out. The only problem is that after it stops, I cannot get it to restart. I get the cannot start a thread twice error. I have been trying to use a conditional loop to get the thread to exit its self but it hasnt been working.

Negative 27969 pstrongTLDR Versionstrongp  pIs it possible to have RichTextlike capabilities in WPFi.e. Bold, Underline, changing color, etc.but emnotem recognize font name or size changesp  pstrongYLL You emlikeem longer Versionstrongp  pWe are creating reportgeneration software and as part of its editor, we have a very simple wordprocessing component with limited formatting from the users perspective bold, underline, change the color of words or sentences, etc.p  pWhat they cant do is change the font, nor do we want them to. The font name and size are to be specified as part of the print options so the output has a clean, consistent look.p  pHowever, we emwouldem like to change the font size and name from a UI perspective, meaning how it looks on screen, which should be completely separate from the data itself.p  pThink how Markdown used on this very site allows basic formatting but doesnt specify font size or name changes.  Markdown wouldve been great but AFAIK it doesnt support color, which we need.p  pIn our current implementation, weve based our control around a RichTextBox so we can have that formatting, but we are spending so much time and effort intercepting pasting from other applications, or running the RTF through fonttablestripping routines before its displayed so it picks up what the users UI font size is.  We have to do the same thing right before we print too, really slowing things down.p  pSo... how would one go about overcoming these issues  Is RTF even the right way to go here  Im getting really close to just writing my own TextBox subclass outright.p

Negative 27969 pI have a situation in which I intend to communicate with a service through a command interface made available via a UNIXdomain socket on the file system. I am able to successfully send it commands, but for a while sat perplexed as to why I could not receive any response to my queries. p  pAs it turns out, the service did not have sufficient permissions to write to the address I or the OS provided for it. However, I realized that if I explicitly codebindcode to an address on the file system then I could adjust the file permissions by leveraging codechmodcode. p  pSomething likep  precodeint mySocket struct sockaddrun localaddr   mySocket  socketAFUNIX, SOCKDGRAM, 0 localaddr.sunfamily  AFUNIX snprintflocaladdr.sunpath, 108  pathtomySocket  bindmySocket, struct sockaddr  amplocaladdr, sizeofstruct sockaddrun chmodpathtomySocket, 777 codepre  pThat is to say, without the final codechmodcode step, the service is unable to write to codemySocketcode because it does not have the appropriate write permissions. Obviously, this is an even harder problem to spot if one does not explicitly codebindcode to a specific address, since the underlying OS will implicitly generate this socket for the user  but it still exists and emstillem will have the same access problems.p  pMy question, then, is with respect to this final step. Is there a way to allow the OS to implicitly generate the socket for my endpoint i.e. the emaddressem to which the service will respond but request that it be given certain permissions p  hr  pemThe Explanationemp  pThe reason this issue is becoming a problem is due to the requirement that other portions of the program be executed as root. As such, when I, as root, attempt to codeconnectcodecodesendcode to the background service, the OS will implicitly create an address to which replies will be directed. However, this leads to the problem that my socketfile, whether implicit or created with codebindcode, will have permissions like codesrw  code, so the other endpoint can only reply if they, too, elevate themselves.p  pThus, the problem goes away if I first codebindcode and then codechmodcode the permissions as I showed above. p

Negative 27969 pI am trying to generate a unique ID with a prefix. to so this I am generating a random number between 0000 and 9999 and adding that to the end of my prefix. What I want to then do is check the sheet in column A to see if that ID already exists and if so then it just generates another random number and it carries on till a unique one is found. To do this I am using a while loop. Below is my code. The issue that I am having is that once the match functions does not find anything it the value remains as the last value ie the row number that it found the last value. For example, if my id is T26  7055 it searches the sheet and finds that it already exists in row 59. it then generates another ID this time say T26 2099 which does not exist, but the match function still returns 59 and the while loops just goes into infinite loop.

Negative 27969 pI am doing some tests to create a JavaScript widget that allows communication across domain.p  pI have a script tag that could be placed on any site that will inject a dynamic form and iframe into their page.p  pThe idea I had was to set the dynamic forms target attribute to the name of the dynamic iframe, so that data can be posted from a third party site to my backend for processing.p  pPut it together and works great in Firefox, but in Chrome the submission forces a new window to open.p  pIf I use a non dynamic iframe, it suddenly works. However it is not very elegant if I want my widget to be easy for third parties to integrate into their sites.p  pAnyone know how to get this working I dont think its my code because, as I say, the code works when the iframe is static. I have verified that the name and ID of the dynamic iframe are set as expected.p  pCheers.p  pI have added a JSFiddle demoing this behaviour.

Negative 27969 pIm writing a program that reads and modifies a binary file which contains infos about some images but to be able to do that it needs also some informations from the user, lets say the folder where this images are located and few choices.p  pWith a quick research on the web I found that an easy way to create GUIs is Tkinter, and in fact I reached my goal quite fast.  In particular I used the codetkFileDialogcode and codetkMessageBoxcode modules without the need to call the codemainloopcode function , creating and destroying a window whenever I wanted to show something in the screen I dont think this is the right approach, but it fitted perfectly for my application, since in this way I was able to leave the program as it was before the necessity to talk with the user, without the need to refactor it with a purely objected oriented structure as in case of a real GUI.p  pThe problem arose when I wanted to improve this interface, and use a embuttonem widget to give the possibility to choose among three options in this case the codemainloopcode seems mandatory..p  pSo here is the question does it exist a strategy to communicate with the user without having to put all your functions inside a GUI class and without using a infinite loop I think the answer is NO using Tkinter What is the best approach in this hybrid situationsp

Negative 27969 pIn working on an ExtJS application being built with Sencha Cmd, I am trying to figure out the best way to safely stub out endpoints while doing local development with the web server packaged with Sencha Cmd.p  pThe two major approaches I have found for this are to either drop code.jsoncode files in the web server path in a location analogous to the final one or to use ExtJSs codeSimManagercode class to stub the endpoints see a hrefhttppeterkellner.net20140120usingtheextjssimmanagertoprovidemockjsondatatoastoreproxy relnofollowhttppeterkellner.net20140120usingtheextjssimmanagertoprovidemockjsondatatoastoreproxya for this approach.p  pThe problem with the first one is that we would have to change the URLs in the stores prior to build because our REST endpoints would not have a code.jsoncode extension. The second one is nice because we can stub data before its ready and work on the frontend independently of the backend. The only concern I see is that it would be quite easy to leave the codeSimManagercode setup in the code before deploying. I really do not want any of our builds to rely on manual intervention before producing the final build. p  pIs there any way to ensure that codeSimManagercode setup is used when doing local development but is dropped when performing a full codesencha app buildcode I did note that the codesencha compilecode command has exclusion operations, but I never did find a good way to integrate this with the problem described above.p
