Positive 8512 pSo this is an assignment Im having trouble getting started with. Weve been going over Linked Lists, and while I feel I have an okay understanding of it, Im having trouble translating it to a program. p  pEssentially the program has to read in two spare matrices from files, print both matrices, compute and print the transpose of both matrices, and compute and print the matrix product of the two matrices.p  pReading in the matrices, and printing both matrices Im fine with.p  pThe issues Im mainly having are with the later part of the assignment, computing, transposing, and the product.p  pAppreciate any help the StackOverflow community can give. p  pAn aside for Design aspectp  pFor this assignment, we will represent only the nonzero entries in the sparse matrix using linked lists. Each nonzero element will be represented by a node. Each node will not only need to keep track of its value, but also its row number and column number. As each node is in exactly one row and one column it will appear in exactly two linked lists one linked list for the row and one linked list for the column. These row and column linked lists will be circularly linked not doubly linked. A head node will be needed for each column list and row list. The head nodes are similarly circularly linked lists one for the row head nodes and one for the column head nodes. A single head node will serve as the head node for both of these lists.p  pAnother aside for Implementation and Testingp  pThe strategy will involve implementing the following classesp  precodeclass Node  Node nextInRow Node nextInColumn   class HeadNode  Node  HeadNode getNext ValueNode getFirst void insertint position, ValueNode value ValueNode getint position   class ValueNode  Node  int row int column int value   class SparseMatrix  Node  void insertint row, int column, int value SparseMatrix transpose SparseMatrix productSparseMatrix sparseMatrix void print HeadNode getRowint position HeadNode getColumnint position int getint row, int col  codepre

When I traverse the entitiy graph in my services, I have no problem. My services been wrapped in a TransactionProxyFactoryBean, so all should be good.p  pSo, in my View Controller I request a bunch of entities from the services. But when I traverse the entity graph in my view controller for example to display users states countrys name, with both state and country being lazily loaded entities, the Hibernate session is already closed and I get a LazyInitializationException could not initialize proxy  no Sessionp  pI wouldnt want my services to eagerly fetch the data, thatll consume way to much RAM because my graphs are deep and can even have circular references. I also dont want to explicitly have to touch on the parts that Ill be displaying in the services, as thatd mean that Ill have to copypaste write similar services over and over again. So what I want is to have the Hibernate session still open when Im in my view controller and not close down the session until the view has been served.

Negative 8512 pI wonder, is there an equivalent of the Monorail View components for Asp.Net MVCp  pWhat I m trying to do is render some complex UI that depends on a class, so say we are in a List view, I want to pass an object to this ViewComponent equivalent and that it will take the object as a parameter and render the complex UI for me allowing me to do other stuff in the view. What would be the best way to do that in Asp.Net MVC p  pSince this is a complex UI I would prefer to write it once, hence templates are not really the way I would like to go, as it will mean I ll have maintainability issues. br  Some options I saw  and I m about to start trying arep  ul liHtml.RenderAction in the futuresli liSubcontrollerli ul  pHowever I d like to know if there is anything else or if one is better than the other for this particular scenariop

The codeltMSBuildcode steps codeIncrementalCleancode task ends up deleting a number of the outputs of codeProjectCcode. When running this under VS2008, a codebuild.forcecode file being deposited in the codeobjDebugcode folder of ProjectC which then triggers ProjectC getting rebuilt if I do a Build on the entire solution if the project containing this codeAfterBuildcode target, whereas if one excludes this project from the build, it [correctly] doesnt trigger a rebuild of ProjectC and emcriticallyem a rebuild of all dependents of ProjectC. This may be VSspecific trickery in this case which would not occur in the context of a TeamBuild or other commandline MSBuild invocation but the most common usage will be via VS so I need to resolve this either wayp  pThe dependent projects and the rest of the solution in general have all been created interactively with VS, and hence the codeProjectRefencecodes contain relative paths etc. Ive seen mention of this being likely to causing issues  but without a full explanation of why, or when itll be fixed or how to work around it. In other words, Im not really interested in e.g. converting the codeProjectReferencecode paths to absolute paths by handediting the .csproj.p  pWhile its entirely possible Im doing something stupid and someone will immediately point out what it is which would be great, be assured Ive spent lots of time poring over codevdiagcode outputs etc. although I havent tried to build a repro from the ground up  this is in the context of a relatively complex overall buildp

All my processing happens at a central location. Would msmq and wcf be leveraged wherein all files from remote locations are copied to central location. The messages could be fed by an application monitoring a DB and once it determines that a file should be copied over, it feeds a message which the wcf service receives and copies the file from remote to central location.p  pAs this is a dedicated network, the file will be accessible via unc paths. I know my clients will be inclined to do this at some point and trying to determine if this is feasible given volume of file and requirements of simultaneous file copies.p  pI suggested BITS but the client is not comfortable with BITS due to politics with their IT dept.p

Negative 8512 pImagine I have a stackbased toy language that comes with the operations Push, Pop, Jump and If.p  pI have a program and its input is the toy language. For instance I get the sequencep  precodePush 1 Push 1 Pop Pop codepre  pIn that case the maximum stack would be 2. A more complicated example would use branches.p  precodePush 1 Push true If   .success Pop Jump .continue .success Push 1 Push 1 Pop Pop Pop .continue codepre  pIn this case the maximum stack would be 3. However it is not possible to get the maximum stack by walking top to bottom as shown in this case since it would result in a stackunderflow error actually.p  pCFGs to the rescue you can build a graph and walk every possible path of the basic blocks you have. However since the number of paths can grow quickly for n vertices you get n1 possible paths.p  pMy current approach is to simplify the graph as much as possible and to have less possible paths. This works but I would consider it ugly. Is there a better read faster way to attack this problem I am fine if the algorithm produces a stack depth that is not optimal. If the correct stack size is m then my only constraint is that the result n is n  m. Is there maybe a greedy algorithm available that would produce a good result herep  pbUpdateb I am aware of cycles and the invariant that all controlf flow merges have the same stack depth. I thought I write down a simple toylike language to illustrate the issue. Basically I have a deterministic stackbased language JVM bytecode, so each operation has a known stackdelta.p  pPlease note that I do have a working solution to this problem that produces good results simplified cfg but I am looking for a betterfaster approach.p

Negative 8512 pIm a TDDer and often have a need to refactor out common or similar code. Similar code is not always a result of copy and paste.p  pIm not looking for tools to identify the regions or suspected duplications, there are a number of tools to do that. And if the code is exactly the same there is no big problem, Eclipse can almost always do that by itself. p  pI am looking for tools to visualize differences of sections of code that are radically different, but my human eye can see the structural similarities, and could possibly be made even more similar, so that the common code eventually could be factored out.p  pIt would be very handy if there was a possibility to mark two regions and get Eclipse or some other tool to mark the differences. With this information it would be much simpler to iteratively move the regions closer until they are the same and then activate the Extract Method refactoring.p  pIt can be done in Emacs of course, but Id like to have this readily available from Eclipse.

Is there a way to have the comboBox set a public variable and then somehow access that variable in the main application and call flipTo with the comboBoxs chosen side Other possibilities p  pAny suggestionsp  pThank you.p  pLaxmidip

Negative 8512 pWhats the state of the art in DNS resolver libraries  I am particularly interested in full not stub resolvers that support any or all of making multiple queries in one request packet, complete DNSSEC validation, returning detailed information about DNSSEC validation to the application, and can handle experimental new RRs without much hacking.  Async queries are nice but not required.p  pPreferred implementation languages would be C, C, Python, or Javascript, but Ill look at anything Id really rather not know about your DNS resolver in INTERCAL, though   A pureJS implementation that could run in a browser with WebSockets support would be extra awesome.p

Negative 8512 pI am studying a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiForth28programminglanguage29Fortha for a personal project I have on my mind. It looks to be a really cool and simple language to implement in a small virtual machine.p  pI am especially impressed by the possibilities of the use of vocabularies on it. On the other hand, I think the way the dictionary works is overly complex for a language that is overall so simple. I say this, because I have read some papers about it, and I know that  much controversy exist.p  pThere are some microprocessors which implement some features of Forth in their instructions, and I am interested to know how they implement the dictionary and features like the vocabulary on them, so I can implement a virtual machine which look like those microprocessors.p  pThat is, the dictionary is not a simple heap which grows up, and is not a simple linear vector which we can simply index, so it is not an easy thing for the microcode of a microprocessor to do I guess. I would be really impressed if those special processors are capable to implement the dictionary like it should be, without any extra code, of course. I think this is impossible.p  pSo for my project, I am considering to code the interpreter with a heap, with opcodes to manipulate it, like it is for example in the 6852. And the code for the dictionary, shall be compiled along with the interpreter and the editor in Forth. I think this should look more like the reality.p  pWhat is all this controversy about How do these special processors work, with relation to the dictionary and the use of vocabulariesp

Negative 8512 pI have developed a Shared Addin for Excel using Extensibility IDTExtensibility2 interface in Visual Studio 2008.p  pIts quite basic in functionality. When a workbook is opened it is stored in a list of opened workbooks, when it is closed the addin will create a new text file then write out some XML to the file, this file is then read by another process which will then deserialize the XML.p  pThe addin works under normal operations  so if the user opens and closes a file then the addin does what it should, if they quit Excel with open workbooks then it does what it should.p  pThe problem is when the user has Excel open with open workbooks and does a LogOff. The two methods OnDisconnection and OnBeginShutdown dont appear to be called, at all.p  pI did two things to test thisp  ol lipI created a TextWriterTraceListener which wrote to a log file when these two methods were called.

Negative 8512 pOn the modelfirst approach in the designer, if I create a relationship where the cardinality on one end of the relationship is 0..1 and 1 on the other, the designer disables the Add Foreign Key Property to.. checkbox.p  pFor example, say that I had an Order entity and an OrderQuantity entity, where the OrderQuantity entity simply stipulates the initial amount of Order entities available, but doesnt have to be specified. Thus an Order can have 0 or 1 OrderQuantity, and an OrderQuantity will always have 1 Order.p  pThe same applies if I am trying to make an entity refer to previous and newer versions of itself i.e. a node in a list.p  pDefining this relationship, the designer will not allow me to add foreign key properties at all, and I have to rely on the navigation methods which are generated fine.p  pHas anyone else experienced thisp

Negative 8512 pOK, so I have a socket codeInputStreamcode over which the server is sending a data stream containing a number of lines of header text followed by a binary stream of bytes making up the pdf file it is sending of a length specified in the header section.

Negative 8512 pIm trying to learn MVC with ASP.Net and am reading Steve Sandersons book. One thing Im confused about is where to place the business logic p  pFor example, when deleting a product all Sanderson has is a method in his CartController that calls the Delete method on the productsRepository. This is strange to me because if there were any business logic, such as ensuring that the product isnt in anyones shopping cart first, etc. it would have to either be in the products repository or the CartController.p  pBoth of these seem like bad places to put business logic the products repository is meant to be easily replaced with another switching from using a db to using a session and using the Controller means you are putting the business logic in the UI layer.p  pShouldnt he be using a class that contains the business logic and calls the repositorys delete method instead The repository being a member variable of the business logic classp

The app I just created does not have these.p  pAs there is obviously a function which is the entry point to the app, can I stick the arguments here I did try this but I am not convinced that I was actually editing the correct function.

Negative 8512 pI want to filter a table using jQuery hideshow based on what the user selects from multiple select elements.p  pI want the user to be able to select multiple values from 1, 2 or 3 of the select elements. So maybe theyll select 2 trainers, 1 recruit and 1 status, or maybe just 1 trainer. Planning on creating a function that will run when the user clicks any of the options.p  pThe way I see it, each select element will have an array of values that the user has selected. So Ill need to loop through each array and compare it to the text in that specific column. Would be easy enough if the options were from only 1 select element. But since it could be 1, 2 or all 3, Im having trouble getting my head around it.p  pAny help would be GREATLY appreciated.p  pTablep  precodelttable idreportsTablegt   lttheadgt     ltthgtReport Numberltthgt     ltthgtDateltthgt     ltthgtNameltthgt     ltthgtTrainerltthgt     ltthgtStatusltthgt   lttheadgt   lttbodygt     lttrgt       lttdgt123451lttdgt       lttdgt05012011lttdgt       lttdgtFirst Recruitlttdgt       lttdgtFirst Trainerlttdgt       lttdgtCompletelttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt       lttdgt123452lttdgt       lttdgt05022011lttdgt       lttdgtFirst Recruitlttdgt       lttdgtSecond Trainerlttdgt       lttdgtIn Progresslttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt       lttdgt543211lttdgt       lttdgt05032011lttdgt       lttdgtSecond Recruitlttdgt       lttdgtFirst Trainerlttdgt       lttdgtCreatedlttdgt     lttrgt   lttbodygt lttablegt codepre  pSelectsp  precodeltselect multiplemultiple nametrainerFiltergt   ltoption valuefirsttrainergtFirst Trainerltoptiongt   ltoption valuesecondtrainergtSecond Trainerltoptiongt ltselectgt ltselect multiplemultiple namerecruitFiltergt   ltoption valuefirstrecruitgtFirst Recruitltoptiongt   ltoption valuesecondrecruitgtSecond Recruitltoptiongt ltselectgt ltselect multiplemultiple namestatusFiltergt   ltoption valuecreatedgtCreatedltoptiongt   ltoption valueinprogressgtIn Progressltoptiongt   ltoption valuecompletegtCompleteltoptiongt ltselectgt codepre  pLooks like I cant post an answer to my question for 8 hours but this is what I came up with thanks to Spencer Ruport.

Negative 8512 pI have been working on Flex project that uses value objects VO for manipulating data on client side.

Application pool. Yes pool. It   means that a certain web application is running multiple   HttpApplication instances in one pool. Yes multiple. Otherwise it   wouldnt be called a pool. How many you may ask. That doesnt   really matter as long as you know there could be more than one. We   trust IIS to do its job. And it obviously does it so well that it made   this fact completely transparent for us developers hence not many   completely understand its inner workings. We rely on its robustness to   provide the service. And it does. Each of these HttpApplication   instances in the pool keeps its own list of HTTP modules that it uses   with each request it processes.p blockquote  pp  pI have a question that under what scenario multiple instances of an Application object can run for a single application. Till now I was aware of the fact that a single application object exists per application. So I am curious to know that is this true that multiple instances can run per application and how it is decided  p

Negative 8512 pIm just curious about this matter. So this question wont be a serious one p  pThis morning, when I was building this wiki app where I could keep all articles, I made a model called strongArticlestrong. I tested the strongarticlesnewstrong page with a form, and it worked. p  pBut, later, when I was polishing articlesindex page, I accidentally clear the file name strongarticle.rbstrong, and manually retyped that name. However, when I tried to run index page, it resulted in error, saying that strongArticle constant is not initialized in articlescontrollerstrong. The strongarticlesnewstrong page was unable to open due to the same error as well.p  pI guess Rails really can catch me doing stupid things... Anyway to fix this Other than rebuild the model and migration Thats what I did to fix the bug. Cumbersome though.p

Negative 8512 pIt is important for a MIDI player to playback the notes as precisely as possible. I never quite succeeded in that, always blaming the timer see a previous thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7778558howtopreventhintsinterruptingatimerHow to prevent hints interrupting a timera.

Negative 8512 pI am just getting into Entity Framework for the first time beyond simple examples.p  pI am using the modelfirst approach and am querying the data source with LINQtoEntities.p  pI have created an entity model that I am exposing as an OData service against a database where I do not control the schema.  In my model, I have two entities that are based off of two views in this database.  Ive created an association between the two entities.  Both views have a column with the same name.p  pI am getting the errorp  blockquote   pstrongAmbiguous column name emcolumnnameem.

How do I fix this, short of changing the view which I cannot do  I think this does have something to do with these entities being mapped to views, instead of being mapped to actual tables.p

Trouble is, the codePagecode directive directly inherits its own codeAppWebPage.xxxxxx.dllcode.  Every page does this.  This is not reflected in the source I have to work with, but is the way it now operates.  The last person to touch it has long since forgotten the details of his work, and Im not familiar enough with ASP.NET to know what to ask.p  pSo my Page directive goes like sop  precodelt page languagevb autoeventwireupfalse  inheritsPage,        AppWebpage.aspx.cdcab7d2 masterpagefileMaster.Master        enablesessionstateTrue  enableEventValidationfalse gt codepre  pWhen I try to precompile the site, my Page directives look totally differentp  precodelt page languagevb autoeventwireupfalse CodebehindPage.aspx.vb        inheritsProject.Page masterpagefileMaster.Master        enablesessionstateTrue  enableEventValidationfalse gt codepre  pAnd, being precompiled, It doesnt yield a pageunique .dll file I can just swap into the live bin directory and change the codePagecode directive for.  Ive tried a number of permutations on the Page directive to try to get it to compile the new VB code on access, but I always wind up with errors, the best of which tell me ASP elements in the .aspx arent defined in the .aspx.vb.p  pCan someone point me in the right direction with thisp
Negative 8512 pDifferent Android devices have different themes. That means, that background colors, like in dialogs, may differ among Android versions and among manufacturers.p  pThis may result into icons getting invisiblep  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comf68nd.png altcompare 2.3 ltgt 4.0.3p  pThe problem with stock Android themes could be solved relatively easy, by providing different colored icons in target specific folders, e.g. white icons in a folder codedrawablev14code, and black ones in codedrawablev10code. But that does not solve the issue that comes with customized themes from manufacturers, may it be TouchWiz, Blur or Sense. It is simply not possible to cover every device by this method.p  pAnother way would be, to draw a small black border around white icons, and vice versa. But if the background would be gray, like in ICS, it wouldnt look good, either.p  pSo, the question is strongHow to provide custom icons, that will work well on every theme, without touching the theme itselfstrongp

Negative 8512 pI have several controls including a DataGrid that I want to be disabled until there is a valid value in the first TextBox in the presentation. So I added a boolean property to bind to in the VM and bind to it in the xaml below.p  pThe binding works, but has the side effect of trapping the user in the TextBox MoneyToAllocate. p  pPresumably this is because the TB binding is LostFocus and there is no place for the focus to go and actually trigger the updates.

Negative 8512 pIm working on the client side application of the clientserver chat Im doing for learning experience. My problem is I cant seem to get the socket and swing,both to run at the same time. p  pWhat I want to is, when the user opens a JOpionsPane and enters the hostname and port number, clicks okay, then they are connected. When the socket information was hardcoded it worked fine, but now Im trying to get the users input for it. p  pWhats meant to happen is, action listener is supposed to create the new SocketManager object that handles communication. Event though it says its connected, it doesnt run. When I create the new SocketManager object and run it on a new thread it connects and revives messages form the server, but then the swings freezes and I have to end the process to shut it down. p  pShould I start it on a new worker thread or something Maybe its just because Im tired, but Im out of ideas. p  pstrongEDITstrong I updated my ActLis.class and SocketManager.class with the suggestion of adding a new thread for my SocketManager object network.

Negative 8512 pI am kinda having a strange requirement. I have a google talk bot amp a standalone app installed in the PC.

Negative 8512 pAnyone knows a good way to use http live streaming tools on nonMac platforms Can you tell me at least if theres good alternatives I need mediafilesegmenter and mediastreamvalidator.p  pOr maybe anyone has a source code or something like that... p  pUPD Ive tried different segmenters, most of them are based on a hrefhttpsgithub.comcarsonmcdonaldHTTPLiveVideoStreamSegmenterandDistributor relnofollowCarsons opensourced segmentera. Now the difference between Apples mediafilesegmenter and this one, that it takes only a transport stream, not just any video. And I need to segment h264 videos.  When I use ffmpeg to convert h26s to mpegts Im getting much bigger files in the end. Even if I try to preserve same audio codec aac it changes video codec form avc to mpegts.p  pDamn I hate Apple. How can they propose that thing as a standard if they dont even provide workarounds for another platforms.p  pI still need to find a way to segment h264 videos, and keep in the segmented files avc and aac codecs.p
Negative 8512 pWith the abundance of techniques being employed to increase parallelization in todays compilertools especially autoparallelization of certain viable codeforcodeconstructs, c.f. the Intel C Compiler, Microsoft Visual Studio 2011, alongside various others, I wondered if parallelization is always guaranteed to improve or have no impact on performance.p  blockquote   pAre there any cases in which parallelization would have a distinctly negative impact on performancep blockquote  pA quick internet search didnt yield much hope, so I decided to turn here to see if anyone has any knowledge of cases where parallelization has a detrimental impact on performance, or better yet, experience in a project where parallelization actually caused difficulties.p  pI am also curious about whether there are any negative performance implication of autovectorization, although I find it quite unlikely that there would be.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 8512 pLets say Im storing 1000 objects in a hashmap. This hashmap is extended to allow me to map three dimensional coordinates to the objects stored in it the objects inside have a fixed size. The hash key is a long integer.p  pHow would I go about figuring out mathematically the probable overhead for this structure p  ol liIs it significant enough that, for instance, if the data inside is around 256mb that the overhead will matterli liIs there a reliable way Aside from a profiler, which Ive found are unreliable in some cases to mathematically calculate what its overhead emshould beemli ol  pIm not interested in the total size of the hashmap  only the emoverheadem that using the hashmap will incur. For instance, if I have 10 ints theyre 4 bytes a piece, so its 40 bytes. If I stick them in an array, I get a constant overhead of 12 bytes  8 for the object header, 4 for the length. If I put them in another structure a TreeSet for instance my overhead will not be constant because a tree needs nodes  so I might get an overhead expressed in terms of n where n is the number of items in the set.p  pA few things are obvious to me, which Ill give as my starting point here.p  ol liI will need to store at least 1000 longs. These are nullable types, so theyre actually objects. I will assume therefore that the 8 byte long integer being used has an object header also of 8 bytes. I will add a factor of 16n.li liI will need references to every object as well, which must exist whether or not the object has been recalled from the map and is being used so thats an additional 8 bytes per object. We could factor it into the data size instead, but since the references are in the hashmap itself, I feel like its best to make them part of the overhead. My logic is as follows If I took all of the data out of the hashmap and stored it in variables, those n references would still exist in the hashmap, provided I didnt emremoveem these data objects, which I wont be doing. The set of objects is constant, though they may be recycled with a different key.li liThe hashmap itself has an overhead of 8 bytes. li liThe hashmap emmustem store the number of items inside or so I think so thats 4 bytes.li liI will suppose ignorantly that the hash keys are in an array, sorted by hash key order. Thats 12 bytes for the array.li liI will assume ignorantly as well that the objects are in a matching array, which it dereferences when it finds the key. I will guess another 12 bytes.li ol  pThis gives me a polynomial equation 36  24np  pThus I have a guess of 24036 bytes overhead for 1000 data objects using long keys. This is somewhat of an insignificant overhead, but my question for you is, what is the real overhead, just sitting therep  hr  pA secondary valid question is, how much does this vary from JVM to JVM Is there any JVM independent way to figure it out To exemplify what I mean, consider a JVM that only has 32bit object headers  when looking at arrays you might say, even though the size varies from JVM to JVM, its a fair estimate that the overhead on an array would become 8 bytes instead of 12 in that case. p  pIm assuming a fixed implementation of HashMap across the same version of Java. p  hr  pI could try to read the source code or run profiling, this however may produce misleading results based on my JVM. Im asking for your help  perhaps someone who knows  for some piece of info that we both dont already know about the situation. Thanksp  hr  pSee the answer below, the actual estimate can be expressed as followsp  p8 words per entry, plus 8 bytes for each long, plus 8 bytes for the hashmap object header.p  pIn my present environment 32 bit OS that makes 1 word  4 bytes.p  ul li40n  8 in a 32bit environment  40k for 1000 entriesli li72n  8 in a 64bit environment  72k for 1000 entries.li ul  pSo it seems to be under 100kbytes.p

It will be a first in first out type stack.li liOnce a webview is requested to be reused, it will execute a destroy method defined in the HTML implementation to null out global variables. This can be done using the UIWebViews stringByEvaluatingJavascriptFromString li liOnce that has completed, the WebView will execute document.innerHTML   to clear out the document.li liThe reused UIWebView will then load the new request.li liI hear use of multiple images can use a large amount of memory.

Negative 8512 pIm trying to make simple shading for a 2D OpenGL scene by placing semitransparent black quads over the scene, but in certain places instead of darkening the scene it completely blacks it out.  Im using codeglBlendFuncGLDSTCOLOR, GLSRCALPHAcode for the shader quads, and codeglBlendFuncGLSRCALPHA, GLONEMINUSSRCALPHAcode for all the other drawing underneath.p  pThis normally works, dimming the area under the semitransparent quad, but in certain situations it behaves oddly.  When the area under the semitransparent quad has only had one quad drawn behind it, it behaves normally.  When another quad or multiple quads are drawn on top of the back quad, it sometimes behaves normally, sometimes blacks out the quad entirely, or sometimes blacks out everything beneath the lastdrawn quad e.g. if I had a red texture with a blue dot on top of it, the red beneath would be blacked out, but the blue dot would remain unchanged.p  pI thought this looked like the quads drawing in the wrong order, but I have codeGLDEPTHTESTcode disabled, so Im not sure if this is odd behavior from the blending, misorder, or something else entirely.  Any ideas as to what could be causing thisp

Negative 8512 pIn summary Today I discovered that when a DLL is built without precompiled headers, a strange error shows when you try to use it.p  pBuilding the DLL goes fine when precompiled headers are disabled. However as soon as the DLL is attached either compiletime or runtime it results in the error Invalid parameter. The actual error codes are different for both cases. When attaching compiletime a dialog pops up with error code 0xc000000d, when calling codeLoadLibrarycode it returns a codeNULLcode pointer and codeGetLastErrorcode returns 0x57.p  pEDITsp  pI discovered that the problem goes away when incremental linking is disabled. Somehow I missed the following error showed by Visual Studio when running a client that attaches to the DLL compiletime p  precodeTestClient.exe Loaded DProjectsPchDllTest2DebugTestClient.exe, Symbols loaded.

Negative 8512 pIm having a bit of trouble getting my resize events to sync. Basically, M.resize updates a divs width css and then I want API.resize to read that new size and update its elements accordingly.

Negative 8512 pI just started writing assembly language programs on linuxubuntu and know for a fact that I have a Intel processor. nasm use Intel like syntax and gasGNU assembler uses ATampT like syntax. But obviously my processor cannot understand ATampT syntax. So I was wondering how this compiler actually works behind the scenes Does it take the file and convert the assembly language back to Intel syntax and then run it on my processor. If so , how does it know what processor I actually haveGiving this doubt a little more thought, even when I install gcc, I dont tell it the type of processor I am using. How does it figure it out thenp
Negative 8512 pIve created a photohosting website with Django that uses the Photologue app which depends on Python Imaging Library.  When users upload photos, multiple resized photos are generated for each e.g. smallmediumlarge, thumbnails, etc.  The trouble is that the resizing process eats up 100 CPU and makes it so that Django can barely handle simultaneous requests an order of magnitude, or more, slower.  Unless I am way off here, it seems I have to limit this CPU usage somehow.p  pIve tried using cpulimit command to limit CPU percentage use on the PID to see if that would even solve the problem, but it seemed to have no effect.  Can I somehow limit CPU usage by PIL  Is there some approach Im missing  My server is an Ubuntu EC2 microtier, so could of lack RAMCPU power be an issue  Seems unlikely to be the issue, since this problem occurs with only two simultaneous users.p  pUPDATE As per Andres suggestion, Ive upgraded to Django 1.4.1, which has made it so the dev server allows concurrent requests however, its still unbearably slow because PIL is hogging the CPU. p

Negative 8512 pIm transitioning our code base from svn to git.p  pOur current deployment process is to run an in house script that checks out the most recent svn revision into a newly created directory to create a working copy on the server.  It then runs any sql commands that need to occur and changes a symlink from the curent working copy to the newly checked out working copy.  p  pThis is a simple way of handling updates and allows us to easily roll back the code base to the old one by changing the symlink if there is an issue.p  pIs it possible to fetch just a single specified branch from a git server into a newly created directory or do I need to clone the entire contents of the repositoryp  pOr is there is a better method of handling the code base with gitp

Negative 8512 pstrongThe Questionstrongp  pIm new to Java and spring and Id like to know how to structure code which marshals different objects from XML and then processes them. Im converting some code JAVA code from before my time to use spring. I know the way Ive approached this this probably, wrong but If someone could offer a few pointers on how to restructure things the Spring way that would help alot. Ive read a lot of the Spring docs, but Im finding it hard to apply what is in there to my code.p  pstrongThe Situationstrongp  pIm not going to post the whole code tree as even and simple example is a lot of code which is the problem. So Ill just describe the method.p  pIve got XML and schemas for two classes CLASSA amp CLASSB. Ive generated JAVA wrappers using xjc. Ive got a JAVA class which is a wrapper for the JAXB marshaller. The wrapper needs to be given the class name and the package name of the class to be marshalled on construction.p  precodepublic JaxbWrapperString ClassName, String packageName throws ClassNotFoundException, InstantiationException,         IllegalAccessException, JAXBException       this.packageName  packageName               set the context is the expensive operation     setJAXBContextClass.forNamefullJaxbClassNameClassName.newInstance               get the schma from preset schema dir     schemaFileName  findSchemaClassName      myMarsheller  jc.createMarshaller      myMarsheller.setPropertyMarshaller.JAXBFORMATTEDOUTPUT, Boolean.TRUE  codepre  pIve then got one bean for each instance of the JaxBWrapper for both ClassA and ClassB. They are almost identical so only the one for class A is shown.p  precodeltbean idjaxbParserCLASSA classorg.test.JAXB.JaxbWrapper     lazyinittrue scopeprototypegt     ltconstructorarg index0 typejava.lang.String         valueCLASSA gt     ltconstructorarg index1 typejava.lang.String         reftestPackage gt     ltproperty nameencoding refxmlEncoding gt ltbeangt codepre  pUnhelpfully the XML files I have to process are delivered emone at a timeem in file with a fixed name and a rolling counter and I cannot change that. So Im unable to tell what object is in the file from the filename. Ive have a tiny utility function which check which the object type is in the file Im trying to process. p  pI then have the following functionp  precodepublic static Object loadXMLString xmlFile, String fileName throws Exception      InputStream iStream  XmlUtils.openFilexmlFile     String xmlObjectType  XmlUtils.getObjectTypeFromXMLxmlFile              get the right JAXB processor     JaxbWrapper jaxB  myContext.getBeanjaxbParser  xmlObjectType , JaxbWrapper.class     Object  obj  jaxB.objectFromXMLiStream, xmlObjectType , fileName     return obj  codepre  pSo Im taking the object name and getting the right bean from the context. This means I could use things like Springs object pool to hold lots of JaxbWrappers for different objects. However the way Ive implemented this feels wrong to me. I dont like the myContext.getBeanjaxbParser  xmlObjectType method of getting the JaxbWrapper bean. p  pemSo my question is Is there a better way of structuring this code A few simple pointers would be very much appreciated.emp  pstrongAdditional Complexitystrongp  pThis is where things, at the moment, become really unmanageable. Once the marshaling stage has completed Ive got a post processing stage where there are several different post processor emfor eachem class type. Ive got Spring beans for each of these and Im getting them from the application context usingp  precodemyContext.getBeanxmlObjectType    processorType    xmlObjectType codepre  pwherep  ul lixmlObjectType is a string CLASSA or CLASSB which is set by reading the object type from the file as above.li liprocessorType is s string which is set from the comand line. li ul  pTo set the proceesorType Im doing something like the following when the application starts.p  precode    if line.hasOptionfile              processorType  FileProcessor          if line.hasOptionprint              processorType  PrintProcessor      codepre  pAgain, I dont think this is the right way to do things, but Its the best Ive got at the moment .p  pstrongI guess the more general question is how do JAXB and Spring work together In the real world I have lots very large and complex CLASSA and CLASSBs. Ive got java classes for these generated by xjc. As Im using xjc I have to use jaxb I guess. The question is how to do that in the Spring world.strongp  pstrongOr can I get rid of JAXB and use a spring component. Id need to use something else to generate all the classes other than xjc. But I cannot find anything that would perform that taskstrong p
Negative 8512 pMy Database Table Schema is something likep  precodeDocumentID Name1 Name2 Name3 Name4 Location1 Location2 Location3....Organization1.. codepre  pNow I have 3 Hashsets available having the above values i.e one for name, one for location and one for organizationp  pIn each single iteration of loop these hashset are being populated with above values.p  pAt the end of each iteration the data from these hashsets is removed and new ones are created.p  pNow my problem is at each iteration I have to populate the sql table row just 1 row each iteration from these hashset values.p  pWhat I am not able to understand is if I have hard coded strings than simply I can use something likep  precodeString sql  INSERT INTO Table                  VALUES 100, Zara, Akli, 18,100, Zara, Ali, 18 codepre  pHowever I need to iterate through each hashset and insert something like above the data of all 3 hashsets in a single row.

Negative 8512 pThe problem all started when Mircosoft updated the security of systems by requiring a minimum key length of 1024.  Please refer to Microsoft Security Advisory 2661254. In the past, we were using the Smartcard logon template that is built into Server 2008 R2.  This created a certificate with a 512 bit public key and used the sha1RSA Signature algorithm.p  pBecause it is not possible to change the key size in the template, we duplicated the Smardcard logon template and modified it to use a 2048  bit key.  When we reissued certificates on our Smart cards, it created certificates using the RSASSAPSS Signature algorithm.  These cards work fine in Vista, 7 and 2008 but do not work in WinXP.p  pCan you please outline, in detail, exactly what steps need to be followed to create a template that can be used to issue cards with at least 1024bit public keys that would work under XP.p

Negative 8512 pWe are using supervisor to deploy a python web application. On deployment, the web application is installed on the server through buildout, and a script for running supervisor is created using collective.recipe.supervisor . This script is called at the end of the deployment process by a fabric script. The problem is that when the deployment script is finished, a SIGHUP signal is sent to the process, which causes supervisor to restart as per this line a hrefhttpsgithub.comSupervisorsupervisorblobmastersupervisorsupervisord.pyL300 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comSupervisorsupervisorblobmastersupervisorsupervisord.pyL300a , but due to some reason, the web app is not restarted after it is terminated. There is no log output after the followingp  precode20121024 152351,510 WARN received SIGHUP indicating restart request 20121024 152351,511 INFO waiting for appserver to die 20121024 152354,650 INFO waiting for appserver to die 20121024 152357,653 INFO waiting for appserver to die 20121024 152400,657 INFO waiting for appserver to die 20121024 152401,658 WARN killing appserver 28981 with SIGKILL 20121024 152401,659 INFO stopped appserver terminated by SIGKILL codepre  pSo I have two questions. The first one is, does anyone know why supervisor restarts on SIGHUP I couldnt find any explanation for this, and there are no command line options that would turn this behavior off. The second question is, how can we fix the problem we are facing We tried starting supervisor with a nohup, but the SIGHUP is still received. The weird thing is that this doesnt happen when I log on to the server, start supervisor by hand, and log out.p  pHere is the supervisor script generated by buildoutp  precodeusrbinpython2.6  import sys sys.path[00]  [ homeusername.buildouteggssupervisor3.0b1py2.6.egg, homeusername.buildouteggsmeld30.6.9py2.6.egg, homeusername.buildouteggsdistribute0.6.30py2.6.egg, ]   import sys sys.argv.extend[c,homeusernameappdirectorypartssupervisorsupervisord.conf]  import supervisor.supervisord  if name  main sys.exitsupervisor.supervisord.main codepre  pAnd here is the configuration file for supervisor, also generated by buildoutp  precode[supervisord] childlogdir  homeusernameappdirectoryvarlog logfile  homeusernameappdirectoryvarlogsupervisord.log logfilemaxbytes  50MB logfilebackups  10 loglevel  info pidfile  homeusernameappdirectoryvarsupervisord.pid umask  022 nodaemon  false nocleanup  false  [unixhttpserver] file  homeusernameappdirectorysupervisor.sock username  username password  apasswd chmod  0700  [supervisorctl] serverurl  unixhomeusernameappdirectorysupervisor.sock username  username password  apasswd  [rpcinterfacesupervisor] supervisor.rpcinterfacefactorysupervisor.rpcinterfacemakemainrpcinterface  [programappserver] command  homeusernameappdirectorybingunicorn bind 0.0.0.05000 appwsgi processname  appserver directory  homeusernameappdirectorybin priority  50 redirectstderr  false directory  homeusernameappdirectory codepre  pWe dont want to install a patched version of supervisor before really understanding the problem, so any information would be highly appreciated.p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 8512 pOK I am lost here. I have read numerous postings here and else where on the topic of how to check for the state of a given element in particular whether it is visible or hidden and make the change of state trigger an event. But I cannot make any of the suggested solutions work.p  pFirstly, as every one seems to leap on this point first, the need to do this has arisen as I have one jQuery script which deals with displaying an svg icon in a clickable state. And another which already has functions to perform relevant actions when the form is made visible by clicking the icon and obviously I want to reuse these.p  pWhat I have triedp  pInitially I tried have both the scripts acting on a single click event this remains the ideal solution....p  pScript 1p  precode .booked.onclick, function           cancellationFormWrapper.cssvisibility,visible  .svgloadURL ..publiciconsbooked.svg   Script 2   .booked.onclick, function    do stuff   codepre  pThis did not work so I tried to research sharing an event across two scripts but couldnt make any head way on this subject so I tried triggering another event for the second script to pick up....p  pScript 1p  precode .booked.onclick, function           cancellationFormWrapper.cssvisibility,visible          cancellationFormWrapper.triggerchange  .svgloadURL ..publiciconsbooked.svg codepre  pScript 2p  precode cancellationFormWrapper.onchange, functionevent      do stuff   codepre  pThis did not work again I am unclear why this didnt have the desired effect.p  pThen I tried isvisible ....p  pScript 1p  precode .booked.onclick, function           cancellationFormWrapper.cssvisibility,visible  .svgloadURL ..publiciconsbooked.svg codepre  pScript 2p  precode cancellationFormWrapper.isvisible, function   do stuff   codepre  pSo I am a bit lost. The ideal would be to return to the first notion. I do not understand why the click event on the svg cannot be handled by both scripts. I assume that this has something to do with event handlers but I am not sure how I could modify the script so they both picked up the same event.p  pFailing that I could use the fact the visibility state changes to trigger the action.p  pAny guidance welcomed.p  pstrongEditstrong Ok I have just resolved the issue with script 2 picking up the triggered event from script 1.  Sad to say this was a basic error on my part ... the form was preventing the display of the alert.   However I still cannot get the isvisible to work.p
Negative 8512 pIve got an inproc COM server dll, built in MSVC10, which is used in a C client.

When an MTA client thread acquires codeIDerivedcode and tries to call any of its methods inherited from codeIBasecode, it crashes somewhere in proxystub. In STA it works well, so I believe codeIDerivedcode is not marshalled correctly. On the other hand, if I QI codeIBasecode explicitly or if I add a method to codeIDerivedcode, everything works well.p  pWhy the empty codeIDerivedcode is not marshalled correctlyp

Negative 8512 pI am creating a database and this is my first time that I work with them.p  pI have one question about the one to one correspondence. I am creating a table that represents a team of a certain sport. p  pI want that every team will have only one arena where it plays matches and every team will have its own arena.p  pThe arena will have many attributes name, seats, ticket price and so on so I would create a table for them even if I have read that the best practise to create a one to one relationship would be to put all in a single table.p  pBecause an arena and a team are two so different concepts i would divide them into two tables in a way like thisp  precodeClub  ClubID PK ClubName . . . ArenaID FK   Arena  ArenaID PK ClubID FK ArenaName Seats TicketPrice codepre  pFuthermore I thought to put the ArenaID not AutoIncremental but to put it equal to the ClubID because I will create the Arena automatically when a Club will be created. Is it reasonablep  pI want to understand well this type of relationship because it will be used also on other cases for example every team will always have also one Assistant Coach with his skills.p  pThanks to allp  pEditp  pKevin Bowersox I was only specifying how the game will be, and I thank you for your answer.p  pPeter Gluck You should think the arena as an attribute of the club, but it has other own attributes and I want to separate it from the club table to organize better the database. If a club wants to build another arena, it simply changes the name of the actual arena and it can change number of seats and ticket price. But the object saved in the database will remain the same. Only some columns will be changed.p  pBranko Dimitrijevic Thanks for the detailed answer. I want to ask you some questions for better understand what you said I am starting now to use databases.  In the first example you dont use two key for both tables that will be, alternatively, one a primary key and the other a foreign key, but you use an only key that is, at the same time, primary and foreign key, is it correct And what is the difference between these two choices Then, you say that it would be better if I put all in single table if I wont have much team, but i I hope that i will have tens or maybe hundreds of thousands teams. In this case is this an enough large number to split the tables I say this because I have more than only this one to one relationship in this table, so if I put all these one to one relationships in the same table it will be very very large..p  pThanks to all for your suggestions, now I will try to use the method with two tables and two different ID keys.  But I will use in other tables the method suggested by ypercubep

Negative 8512 pI have a single .NET web app running in an ARR cluster IIS with multiple machines.p  pEach machine must keep a cache for user access permissions in memory. That is, when the app must determine whether the user has permission to access a resource, it queries a memory cache to avoid database access theres a lot of queries per user request.p  pThe problem is that, in certain situations, this cache must be invalidated. But, as there are multiple machines, when one decides the cache must be invalidated, it has to be propagated to the other machines.p  pWhat is the best practice to solve this problem We have an ASP.NET MVC 3 app running on a IIS ARR cluster.p

My question is I dont see a DataSource domain for codeLineAndMarkerltMarkerPointsGraphgtcode, so I have no idea how I can update data Here is an example in which I used codeLineGraphcode instead of codeLineAndMarkerltMarkerPointsGraphgtcode But codeLineGraphcode does not seem to handle markers.p  precodefor int i  0 i lt nColorChannels i      if dataX[i].Length  dataY[i].Length              EnumerableDataSourceltintgt xOneCh  new EnumerableDataSourceltintgtdataX[i]         xOneCh.SetXMappingxVal gt xVal         EnumerableDataSourceltintgt yOneCh  new EnumerableDataSourceltintgtdataY[i]         yOneCh.SetYMappingyVal gt yVal         CompositeDataSource ds  new CompositeDataSourcexOneCh, yOneCh          Action UpdateData  delegate                      LineGraphplotter.Children.ElementAtstartIndex  i.DataSource  ds                    this.Dispatcher.InvokeSystem.Windows.Threading.DispatcherPriority.Normal,                                UpdateData       codepre  pAny suggestions is appreciated.

Negative 8512 pIm working with a  PHP frontend which connects to a distributed back end, using Amazon SQS and a variety of message types and message consumers. Im trying to come up with a way to safely debug those consumers, as we dont want message handlers with new, untested code consuming enduser messages, risking the messages being lost or incorrectly processed.p  pThe actual message queue names are hardcoded as PHP constants in a class, so my first tactic was to create two different sets of queues, one for production and another for debugging, and to externalise the queue name constants into two different files. Depending on whether our debug condition is true or not, I wanted to include one or the other of those constant definitions and assign the constants in the included file to the class constants which currently have the names hardcoded.p  pThis doesnt seem to work though because constants seem to act like class variables in PHP whereas I am trying to assign the values like instance variables. The next tactic was to see if there was anything on Amazons side that would allow us to debug our message consumers transparently without adding lots of hacks to our code, but I couldnt see anything there that facilitated this. Id love to know if anyone else has experienced and ideally, solved this problemp

Negative 8512 pI have an iOS application that plays different audio effects and records audio at the same time. The purpose of the application is currently not important, but Im having problems with stock iOS audio effects.p  pTo play the effects, I use codeSimpleAudioEnginecode from codeCocosDenshioncode API which uses codeAVAudioPlayercode, as far as I can see. The effects are preloaded and they work fine I actually play them on buttons, scrolling and similar. Effects are played with the following codep  pIn codewillFinishLaunchingWithOptionscode methodp  precode[[SimpleAudioEngine sharedEngine] preloadEffectsound.wav] codepre  pIn other methods when playing is requiredp  precode[[SimpleAudioEngine sharedEngine] playEffectsound.wav] codepre  pNo wonders here, but at the same time, I am recording noise from the builtin microphone with codeAVCaptureSessioncode API.

I found a way around this, to activate codemixWithOtherscode category, which is done with the following codep  precode[[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setCategory AVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient error nil] UInt32 doSetProperty  1 AudioSessionSetProperty kAudioSessionPropertyOverrideCategoryMixWithOthers, sizeofdoSetProperty, ampdoSetProperty [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setActive YES error nil] codepre  pThis is done before creating the codeAVCaptureDevicecode and codeAVCaptureSessioncode. The application works like it should, sounds are played and microphone reads the data. Hardware buttons are also working on the codeCocosDenshion SimpleAudioEnginecode mute and volume.p  pBut apparently, the application has a bug.p  pstrongWhen mute is disabled and application is playing sounds, the iOS keyboard clicking sounds on TextField are not played.strong I want the clicking sounds to play.p  pI have debugged the code a bit and apparently it has something to do with strongAudio session settingsstrong. If I set the category to codeAVAudioSessionCategorySoloAmbientcode, the clicking sounds are played, but at very low volume emthe volume is maxed out and application sounds play out at max volume just nicelyem. strongAnd it gives another problem, SoloAmbient cancels my CaptureSession, which is understandable.strongp  pI am testing the application on iPhone 5, but the same thing happens on the simulator too.p  pstrongSo, what am I doing wrong with settings How could I fix the settings so I keep all my audio sessions active and keep the iOS system soundsstrongp  pThank youp

Negative 8512 pI am preparing for my 1st year test and one of the questions I know about is Create a user control with a textBox and a button, and on form create a listBox Okay. Now what has to happen is the listBox lists files from a dir. and the textBox in User Control reads the contents of this file.txt and the user is allowed to edit the text box, and the save button when click must then overwrite the original file. Now I got the whole textBox reading going using StreamReader. But I cant get the Button in the User Control to get the dir path from the ListBox.p  pI have to overwrite it using StreamWriter, cant use the FileDialog. It has to get the file name from the ListBox, and then that gets loaded into the StreamWriter dir path which needs to be in btnSave which lies in the UserControl.p  pI tried doing the vice versa with the userControl codeuserControl1.Textcode property with a property I made.

Negative 8512 pIm completely new to jQuery Mobile and just trying to get a feel for how it might to work in my environment. p  pOne Page 1 Im displaying values that come down from the server.  What I want to do is go to Page2 to set the values and then pressing Back have page 1 show the updated values.p  pCurrently when I hit back, its showing the original values and I need to do a manual partial or full refresh to get them updated.p  pHow can I tell jQuery Mobile to auto refresh a page on hitting the back button  Im using datarelback.p  pI guess Im looking to see if theres a universal setting for this or something.  Similar to  .mobile.ajaxEnabled  false which I needed to turn on in my environment to get things working.p  pThanksp  pUPDATE Ive added some code here per request. Not sure it will really help.  But heres whats going on.  Im trying to use jQuery Mobile in the context of an IBM XPages application.  XPages is basically Java Server Faces but it has Dojo 1.8.1 built into it do to certain things like a Partial Refresh of a Div automatically.  So for instance on a button I can write server side code  int a Java Managed Bean, get a result, and have it partial refresh a div on the webpage.  Cool stuff. But the problem I GUESS is conflicts between jQuery Mobile and the build in Dojo that makes those things work.  I dont want to use the mobile portion of Dojo because jQuery seems so much better.p  pAnyway  I got jQuery Mobile to work by making sure it loaded BEFORE the dojo pieces loaded.  The other way around it wouldnt work at all.  Id like to work with individual pages rather then virtual pages in one.  p  pIm not sure if I care about much caching really as the pages will almost always be changing.  Im working on an inventory application with iPads and barcode scanners.  So for instance on page1 I scan an item.  Then I might move to page 2 to let the user do something with the item, on hitting the back button I want page 1 to refresh so its updated with any new informationp  pThanks for any advicep  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml langengt ltheadgt lttitlegtlttitlegt ltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth,initialscale1gt ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefhttpcode.jquery.commobile1.3.1jquery.mobile1.3.1.min.cssgt ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpcode.jquery.comjquery1.9.1.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpcode.jquery.commobile1.3.1jquery.mobile1.3.1.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefxsp.ibmxspres.minicssDaampampIbampamp2Tfxsp.cssampamp2TfxspLTR.cssampamp2TfxspSF.css.cssgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcxsp.ibmxspresdojoroot1.8.1dojodojo.js djConfiglocale enusgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcxsp.ibmxspres.minidojo.enusIq.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgtdojo.requireibm.xsp.widget.layout.xspClientDojoltscriptgt ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefjqm.nsfthemesczarnowskiMobile.min.cssgt ltheadgt ltbody classxspView tundragt ltform idviewid1 methodpost actionjqm.nsfhome.xsp classxspForm enctypemultipartformdatagt ltdiv datarolepage datathemebgt ltdiv dataroleheadergt lth1gtltspan idviewid1id2computedField1 classxspTextComputedFieldgtScannerltspangtlth1gtltdivgt ltdiv datarolecontentgt ltdiv idviewid1id2callback3gt ltul datarolelistviewgtltligtlta idviewid1id2callback3link2 hrefjqm.nsfmenuFacility.xsp classxspLinkgtFacility Menultagtltligtltligtlta idviewid1id2callback3link3 hrefjqm.nsfmenuShow.xsp classxspLinkgtShow Menultagtltligtltulgtltbrgtltdiv idviewid1id2callback3id12timePanelgt lttablegtlttrgtlttdgtltspan idviewid1id2callback3id12label1 classxspTextLabelgtviewScopeltspangtlttdgt lttdgtltspan idviewid1id2callback3id12computedField1 classxspTextComputedFieldgtltspangtlttdgt lttdgtltbutton classxspButtonCommand typebutton nameviewid1id2callback3id12button1 idviewid1id2callback3id12button1 datarolenonegtUpdateltbuttongtlttdgt lttdgtltbutton classxspButtonCommand typebutton nameviewid1id2callback3id12button3 idviewid1id2callback3id12button3 datarolenonegtClearltbuttongtlttdgt lttrgt lttrgtlttdgtltspan idviewid1id2callback3id12label2 classxspTextLabelgtsessionScopeltspangtlttdgt lttdgtltspan idviewid1id2callback3id12computedField2 classxspTextComputedFieldgtltspangtlttdgt lttdgtltbutton classxspButtonCommand typebutton nameviewid1id2callback3id12button2 idviewid1id2callback3id12button2 datarolenonegtUpdateltbuttongtlttdgt lttdgtltbutton classxspButtonCommand typebutton nameviewid1id2callback3id12button4 idviewid1id2callback3id12button4 datarolenonegtClearltbuttongtlttdgt lttrgt lttrgtlttdgtCurrent Timelttdgt lttdgtltspan idviewid1id2callback3id12computedField3 classxspTextComputedFieldgt73940 PMltspangtlttdgt lttdgtlttdgt lttdgtlttdgt lttrgt lttrgtlttdgtltbutton classxspButtonCommand typebutton nameviewid1id2callback3id12button5 idviewid1id2callback3id12button5 datarolenonegtPartial Refreshltbuttongtlttdgt lttdgtltbutton classxspButtonCommand typebutton nameviewid1id2callback3id12button6 idviewid1id2callback3id12button6 datarolenonegtFull Refreshltbuttongtlttdgt lttdgtlttdgt lttdgtlttdgt lttrgt lttrgtlttdgtlttdgt lttdgtlttdgt lttdgtlttdgt lttdgtlttdgt lttrgt lttablegt ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv datarolefooter datapositionfixedgt ltdiv idviewid1id2callback2gt Footer Testltdivgt ltdivgt ltdivgt ltscriptgt  .mobile.ajaxEnabled  false           .mobile.pushStateEnabled  falseltscriptgt ltinput typehidden nameviewid idviewid1VUID valuedgljtbhtgwgt ltinput typehidden namexspsubmitidgt ltinput typehidden namexspexecidgt ltinput typehidden namexspsubmitvaluegt ltinput typehidden namexspsubmitscrollgt ltinput typehidden nameviewid1 valueviewid1gtltformgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt  XSP.addOnLoadfunction  XSP.attachPartialviewid1id2callback3id12eventHandler1, viewid1id2callback3id12button1, null, onclick, function, 2, viewid1id2callback3id12timePanel XSP.attachPartialviewid1id2callback3id12eventHandler3, viewid1id2callback3id12button3, null, onclick, function, 2, viewid1id2callback3id12timePanel XSP.attachPartialviewid1id2callback3id12eventHandler2, viewid1id2callback3id12button2, null, onclick, function, 2, viewid1id2callback3id12timePanel XSP.attachPartialviewid1id2callback3id12eventHandler4, viewid1id2callback3id12button4, null, onclick, function, 2, viewid1id2callback3id12timePanel XSP.attachPartialviewid1id2callback3id12id32, viewid1id2callback3id12button5, null, onclick, function, 2, viewid1id2callback3id12timePanel XSP.attachEventviewid1id2callback3id12id34, viewid1id2callback3id12button6, onclick, null, true, 2    ltscriptgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 8512 pI am currently working on an application where a client makes some call to a web services, some small amount of processing is done on the JSON data returned, and then that is stored in a database.

Also, I did not manager to change the color of the foreground text. How can I do that, both in the combo and in the selection popup menup  p[EDIT]p  pFurther investigations I tried to put the properties using codeUIManager.getLookAndFeelDefaults.putcode instead of codeboxDefaults.putcode, and I got the expected result for the arrowButton, which appears as a red square for both classic and pimped combo, obviously. So, I guess what Im doing wrong is to override the properties for the pimped combo, i.e. thos two lines that I got from a hrefhttpwww.jasperpotts.comblog200808skinningasliderwithnimbus relnofollowJasper Potts blogap  precodepimpedCombo.putClientPropertyNimbus.Overrides, boxDefaults pimpedCombo.putClientPropertyNimbus.Overrides.InheritDefaults, false codepre  pCan anyone helps on thatp  p[EDIT 2]p  pI also note inconsistent behaviour if I use codeUIManager.putcode instead of codeUIManager.getLookAndFeelDefaults.putcode, where the arrowButton will appear red for example only on mouseOver, or cliked, etc. Javadoc says codeUIManger.putcode only affects the developers defaults, not the LampF defaults. Whats the difference Any help, link to good documentation on how everything works would be helpful.p

Negative 8512 pInitially I had Timer0 working fine during the run mode. The only problem is when the device goes to sleep mode, Timer0 stops counting up until awaken.

However, there is something I might have missed that is different about timer1 than timer0, since the timer1 is not counting up at all.

Negative 8512 pI have a very frustrating problem and I dont have an idea what is wrong. I build simple XML which contains only GridView. This gridview should show images ImageView downloaded from specific urls which I retreive with my code. p  pSo the idea of this APP is only to download images from URLS and show those images in GridView. First I must say that Im using Universal Image Loader library. First please look at my getView codep  precodeOverride         public View getViewint position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent           ImageView iv          ifconvertView  null           iv  new ImageViewMyActivity.this         iv.setLayoutParamsnew GridView.LayoutParamssize,size         iv.setScaleTypeImageView.ScaleType.CENTERCROP         Log.dAPP, convertView is NULL                     else           iv  ImageView convertView         Log.dAPP, convertView is NOT null                    loader.displayImageURLS.getposition, iv          return iv       codepre  pstrongPROBLEMstrong p  pCode above works, and it shows images in GridView. But when I scroll down, I see thatp  ol liAll images were downloaded Even those images who are not visible li liWhen i scroll back up I see that image which was in place 0, is in place 1 and it has been downloaded again. When I scroll back down, images switched positions again. Scrolling back up, I see again images are switching places again  and downloading again. This goes infinite.li ol  pstrongHOW I SOLVED THIS PROBLEMstrongp  ol lipI solved this problem by NOT checking if convertView variable is null. Actually I ommited ifelse clause. pli lipI used cache in memory  true. So downloading stops and images are in place for ever.pli ol  pSo why Im asking for help Mainly because i know that i should not ommit ifelse clause for performance reasons. I dont want to mess with users memory and I would like to bring them fast and reliable user experience. Also i would like to know what could be wrong.p  pThank you for help. Much appriciated.p

Negative 8512 pI am using Scapy to capture WiFi client request frames. I am only interested in the MAC and requested SSID address of the clients.

When I run my script, my processor utilization rises to nearly 100. I assume this is because of the sheer volume of frames that Scapy is sniffing and passing to my Python code. I also assume that if I could employ the right filter in my sniff command, I could eliminate many of the frames that are not being used and thus reduce the processor load. p  pIs there a filter statement that could be used to do thisp

Have a look at those a hrefhttpsgithub.comwatusijquerymobileiscrollview relnofollowiScrollViewa in combination with simultaneous transitions.p  ol lipstrongcodeltagtcode Tagsstrong Since my WebApp is not containing any listviews, but many codeltdivgtcodes with codeltimggtcode tags, which are wrapped inside an codeltagtcode tag, i think, it might be worth the time ro remove all the bad anchorspli lipstrongShadowsstrong I like those nicy shadows provided by JQM but maybe i should have a try in boosting scrollperformance when diabling them  like suggested here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17286307jquerymobilephonegapverticalscrollingchoppyharderclickapli lipFixed ToolBarspli ol  pIn order to distinguish between hScroll and vScroll maybe this will help mep  precode you can set this fix in DOM ready or jQMs mobileinit   DOM ready function .event.special.swipe.scrollSupressionThreshold  100       jQM defaults   document.bindmobileinit, function      .event.special.swipe.scrollSupressionThreshold  100    codepre  pIf anything of these suggestions might bring me a bit closer to smoothy scrollness   im gonna tell you.. at the latest tomorrow p  pKind regards, TorchManp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pOk folks, bad news  nothing helped. I thought it has anything to do with those anchortags and theyve been my most budding candidate. Whats next Ive experimented quite a while with iScroll but ive got to say that the codeltulgt   ltligt ... ltligt ltulgtcode Pattern is not what i wanted and iScroll only works good for listViews and not deep cascaded markup. The best way is to stay with iScrollView which wraps iScroll in a sophisticated way. What i can tell 4 sure is, that markup consisting out of a pattern with DIVs and anchors and interlaced DIVs with IMGTags seem to result in a choppy scrolling on Android webkit  even with iScrollView. Now i will change my dynamic markup to jQuery Mobile a hrefhttpview.jquerymobile.com1.3.2distdemoswidgetslistviews relnofollowListViewsa coz i hope this will work. Btw the markup is not that deep interlaced and does not consist out of that much DIVblocks.p

Negative 8512 pIm in a position where I need to get some object oriented features working in C, in particular inheritance. Luckily there are some good references on stack overflow, notably this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3322650semiinheritanceinchowdoesthissnippetworkSemiinheritance in C How does this snippet worka and this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions415452objectorientationinc415536415536ObjectOrientation in Ca. The the idea is to contain an instance of the base class within the derived class and typecast it, like sop  precodestruct base      int x     int y   struct derived      struct base super     int z   struct derived d d.super.x  1 d.super.y  2 d.z  3 struct base b  struct base ampd codepre  pThis is great, but it becomes cumbersome with deep inheritance trees  Ill have chains of about 56 classes and Id really rather not type derived.super.super.super.super.super.super all the time. What I was hoping was that I could typecast to a struct of the first n elements, like thisp  precodestruct base      int x     int y   struct derived      int x     int y     int z   struct derived d d.x  1 d.y  2 d.z  3 struct base b  struct base ampd codepre  pIve tested this on the C compiler that comes with Visual Studio 2012 and it works, but I have no idea if the C standard actually guarantees it. Is there anyone that might know for sure if this is ok I dont want to write mountains of code only to discover its broken at such a fundamental level.p

When I use Session.deletereqCandObject with hibernate it works fine and cascades through deleting the One entry from the candidatejobReq table as well as the associated comments.  However, I want to delete emallem of the candidatejobReq entries that have a certain candidate ID and also delete the comments  I tried the function below but unlike the nice hibernate.deleteobject function, this one runs into a foreign key constraint error.

Negative 8512 pIm new to GitHub and have a Java application in my local GitHub folder.

Negative 8512 pIm pretty far along in a project and have hit an undesirable snag and unable to find a solution.  I have some sudo code that I believe will illustrate what I am trying to do but is not full code.  The error is NullPointerException on the ContextWrapper in the Main class when attempting to pass it to an ImageHandler.  Unfortunately, ImageViews and I suspect all Views, try to resolve their drawables before an activity has called the onCreate.  So I had to try and store images into the Activity Constructor but then I am unable to pass the context.  I have considered AsyncTask or the handler to wait for the onCreate of the activity but then I might as well go back to SurfaceView and creating my own designs.  I will continue to look but if someone with more android experience then me knows of either better design or the solution the help would be tremendous.  Also the eclipse layout previewer being compatible is highly preferred.  I have also tried to have each imageview independently have the desired layerdrawables even though alot of them are the same but the performance is terrible.  Had to add the constructor in the Activity because if the imagehandler is created in the onCreate it will be null when the the ImageView tries to call it on its constructor.  Why the Activities components ready themselves before Activity.onCreate is called is something  I dont quite understand yet.p  precode public class MainActivity extends Activity   ImageHandler ih  MainActivity             Log.dAcitivity, Constructed     ihnew ImageHandlerthis     ihnew ImageHandlerthis.getApplicationContext     ihnew ImageHandlerthis.getBaseContext   Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState             Log.dActivity, Created     setContentViewR.layout.activitymain   Override public boolean onCreateOptionsMenuMenu menu       Inflate the menu this adds items to the action bar if it is present.     getMenuInflater.inflateR.menu.main, menu     return true   public LayerDrawable getImageint someidentifier     return ih.getImagesomeidentifier     codepre  pp  precode public class ImageHandler  LayerDrawable[] image  ImageHandlerContext context             Log.dImageView, Constructed     manipulate resource images to create custom layerdrawables and store.           originally attempted to create a layer.xml and although it worked     in the emulator perfectly the behavior was quite different in live tests.     although it made sense any change to layer.xml images was global for all who used it     the strange behavior was that the emulator behaved as desired.    public LayerDrawable getImageint identifier     return image[identifier]    codepre  pp  precode public class SomeImageView extends ImageView  public SomeImageViewContext context, AttributeSet attrs      supercontext, attrs     int someidentifier0     this.setImageDrawableMainActivitycontext.getImagesomeidentifier     codepre  pThanks again community for any help.p

That is, I have the followingp  precode Model class Article lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany categories    acceptsnestedattributesfor categories end   Controller class ArticlesController lt ApplicationController   def update     article  Article.findparams[id]      article.updateattributesupdateparams     ...   end    private    def updateparams     params.requirearticle.permittitle, ..., categoriesattributes gt [name, ...]   end end   Logger for the update request Started PATCH articles6 Processing by ArticlesControllerupdate   Parameters utf8gt, articlegttitlegtSample title, categoriesattributesgt0gtnamegtSample Category 1, ...gt..., 1gtnamegtSample Category 2, ...gt...,  ... gt ...   ... codepre  pThe issue is related to the way Rails handles things for updating associated records in the database, in my case when updating categories through the codearticlecode object when data is submitted so to fire the codeupdatecode action and parameters are passed to the codeupdateattributescode method as shown in the logger above then Rails creates new category records in the database, one for each element present in the hash codecategoriesattributescode.p  pHowever, emmy intention is to update existing category records if those exist or create new ones if those do not existem, accordingly to the uniqueness of codearticleidcode and codenamecode columns in the codecategoriescode database table, probabily performing a search for data present in these columns in order to check if it is needed to update or create new records. In fact, in the edit article view I display a form with input fields for editing categories including fields prepopulated with data related to existing categories and empty fields for categories that can be created on the fly by the editor user.p  pHow can I properly handle this behavior Is it model or controller responsability Or, maybe, is there a better way to manage categories directly in the edit article view p
Negative 8512 pI would like the experts here to have an opinion on the following problem. I would like to design a program in which derived classes from different base classed interact with each other. To make my point clear, I have constructed an example.p  pImagine that I try to make a zoo. In this zoo we have animals, and we have fruits, which are my base classes. Only during runtime we know which animals we have, and which fruits. Assume that I have a monkey and a banana. p  pHow do I let this monkey consume a banana in an elegant way, where eating a banana is a very unique skill of this monkey only Note that I dont want a generic eat function, because I need in my design total freedom in the actions that a derived animal can perform.p  pThis is the accompanying examplep  precodeinclude ltstringgt include ltiostreamgt  class cfruit    class cbanana  public cfruit    class canimal    class cmonkey  public canimal    public     int eatbananacbanana   stdcout ltlt BURP ltlt stdendl    int main    cfruit  fruit   canimal animal     on runtime the animal and the fruit is decided, so we have to     initialize it on the base pointer     assume we get a monkey and a banana   fruit   new cbanana   animal  new cmonkey     now, we would like our monkey to eat a banana, which we cannot do...

My first idea was to use the UnivariateSpline function of scipy, but the problem is that this does not consider the small noise in a good way. If you consider the frequencies, the background is much smaller than the signal, so a spline only of the cutoff might be an idea, but that would involve a back and forth fourier transformation, which might result in bad behaviour. Another way would be a moving average, but this would also need the right choice of the delay.p  pAny hints books or links how to tackle this problemp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combcaCP.png altexamplep

Negative 8512 pWe are buildingmaintaining a complex motioncontrolplatform control application with 14 subsystems, each with its own thread, including several animated 2D or 3D windows.  Legacy requirements mandate JRuby 1.5.2 running on top of Java jre6 jdk1.6.021 with Java3D 1.5.2, on top of Windows XP or 7.p  pWhen a Java Swing tooltip popup in one of the 2D controlpanel windows, null Layout, overlaps amp falls outside the bottom edge or sometimes the right edge of the window, the overall Windows Java screen update rate for all the windows slows from 16 Hz to 4 Hz. Often this effect continues until one of the windows is resized.  Sometimes this effect goes away when the tooltip disappears.  Occasionally the effect doesnt occur at all.  p  pThis occurs both on 32bit Windows XP and 64bit Windows 7, pointing more towards Java.  There are other amusing bugs where the Windows sleep clock actually speeds up when random unrelated thirdparty communications applications are running, but I think thats a red herringthis ones definitely a Java  Windows windowslayout bug. Best guess is Windows cant handle Javas resizing the effective window area rapidly  But then why would the effect continue even after the tooltip popup goes awayp  pOne source reports improvements with ensuring that all tooltips are wider than 150 pixels.  It is one workaround, although since the mechanism for the bug is not known, and the bug is stochastic, this helpful voodoo does not seem to guarantee a solution as well, it precludes short tooltips.p  pDoes anyone know WHY this combination of JRubyJavaSwingWindows is having problems with tooltips, and what can be done about it seriously    p

Negative 8512 pWe have inherited a nasty database with a TON of orphaned and corrupt data. Id like to get it cleaned up but Im having difficulty figuring out exactly how to go about it because the data spans several tables. Basically, we have a lot of transactions that have no associated orders. These transactions need to be deleted as they have no relevant order information and are causing problems with reporting.p  pstrongTable transactionsstrongp  precode  id     1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   codepre  pstrongTable registrationsstrongp  precode  id  transactionid     1              10    2               9    3               8    4               7    5               6    6               5    7               4    8               3    9               2   10               2   codepre  pstrongTable storeordersstrongp  precode  transactionid                10                9                8                7                6                5                4                3                2                2   codepre  pSo, youll see that we have transactions 110 and we have registrations and store orders which both reference the transactions table. You see that transaction ID 1 is not represented in EITHER coderegistrationscode or codestoreorderscode and therefore is considered an orphan transaction. Some transactions will only have a registration. Some will have only a store order. Some will have both. The goal of this is to eliminate rows from the transactions table that do not have a corresponding entry in either of the other tables.p

Negative 8512 pI am trying to create a function that will act as a casesensitive attribute of a phrase search. In the context of the program, a user will have a text document that they can then query a phrase search, and each instance of that phrase will be highlighted in the document. This phrase search can either by case sensitive or not. p  pObviously if the query is case sensitive, the search will be further restricted, whereas if it is not case sensitive, a more generalized search will be completed. Now Im just trying to come up with the best way to approach this.p  pThe program is in Visual C, in Visual Studios 2012, and will be using a form component. Does CVisual C support the idea of regular expressions Are there other ways to go about restricting the search to make it case sensitive p  pAny knowledge, tips, or anything is appreciated. Thanks in advance.p

The codeviewDidAppearcode method is however so I am trying to set the button there.

When the controllers are instantiated in the delegate methods I simply set the navigationItem property equal to that of the detailViewController.  That way in my codeviewDidAppercode methods I could create the button.  Then at codeviewWillDisappearcode I set the button to codenilcode.  You can also just create the button at codeviewdidLoadcode of the codeDetailViewControllercode and change the text and action in codeviewDidAppearcode of the individual viewControllers.

Negative 8512 pI would like to hear your opinions and ideas about how to solve a task I have encountered about a form with a little complex behavior.p  pImagine a search form which contains approx. 30 input elements text, select, checkbox, etc. which dynamically change during the users input process. E.g. if you change the first select, some fields must change to be hidden, some fields must change to be required, etc. The field relations are mapped in a matrix in an Excel from which the backend will process this information and provide it for the frontend  me. The generated form fields can be provided by custom classesdata attributes and I might get a JSON with the relations and process everything on my own from that point. These relations will probably change in the future, or at least the application must be ready for that, so that also needs to take into consideration. JQuery is available and also I can use some AngularBackbone type framework if neeeded.p  pI am a junior frontend developer and to be honest, I havent come up with a solid solution yet, so I would appreciate every thoughtprovoking input p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 8512 pI downloaded the iOS SDK for the Linea Pro device from their website and have successfully implemented some of it in my App  but I noticed the device strongemneveremstrong seems to work while its connected to the Mac via the USB cable. Ive verified this 100 because as soon as I disconnect the LineaPro sled from the USB cable and run their Apps, it finds the Scanner and works. Otherwise, nothing.p  pThis of course makes debugging near impossible because if youre not connected to Xcode you obviously cant see any output the App may have in Xcodes Console. You cant NSLog anything to the console, you cant put Breakpoints, you cant stepthrough your code  you pretty much cant do any of the things youd normally do when developing an App.p  pIve actually had to resort to creating UITextViews and outputting everything I can to them during runtime  which of course clutters up the interface big time but even with that, if the App crashes, you never get to see your TextViews youre thrown out and back to the iOS home screen, staring at all your little icons. p  pIve got some other ideas regarding workarounds  but thats just it theyre all workarounds. Does anyone out there know if theres any way to use the Linea Pro while its still connected to Xcodep

Negative 8512 pWhen I have read about faster css selectors, I have notice codeIDscode and codeClassescode are faster than any other. Also, browsers match your codeCSS Selectorscode from strongRightstrong to strongLeftstrong. That is, the most specific selector first. p  pSo the author said emDo not attach any descendents to the classes IDs.em  p  pHowever, when I have read the source code of Facebook and Twitter, I have found them using CSS this way code.uiInfoTable .label .annotationcolor999code, code.bigphotopermalink .tweet .tweettimestamp some csscodep  pWhen these selectors are slow, why dont they simply use code.annotationcolor999code instead of such a long selector, or if the class is available to both tags, then why not create a new class and add those CSSp  pIs there anything I should know about descendent selectors Do they have impact on performance of CSS selectorsp
Negative 8512 pSo Im using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comPrinzhornskrollr relnofollowPrinzhorn skrollra to create a site that has text and images roll in with the scrolling or swiping of the page.  Everything works fine but I think I found a performance bug.  The way skrollr works is by using data attributes with numbers as names and the number is the point at which the animation is supposed to happen.  The values of the data attributes are css rules.p  pI have to use codedisplaynonecode on a few code blocks that are hidden or visible depending on screen size.  This is bc the number in the data attribute is sometimes too large for mobile screens and the animation happens at the wrong time.p  pAnyways, the problem is the css in the code blocks that are hidden is calculating even while the block is set to codedisplaynonecode. p  pIn the code below, you can see the opacity for the mobile nav block recalculating in Chromes dev tools while at desktop widths.p  precodeltnavgt lt  Desktop and tablet  gt ltdiv classhideforsmallgt   lta idmenubtn hrefgt     ltimg srcassetsimgmenubtn.png altMenu data600opacity1 data620opacity0 gt     ltimg srcassetsimgmenubtnalt.png altMenu data600opacity0 data620opacity1 gt   ltagt ltdivgt lt  End Desktop and tablet  gt  lt  Mobile  gt ltdiv classshowforsmallgt   lta idmenubtn hrefgt     ltimg srcassetsimgmenubtn.png altMenu data560opacity1 data580opacity0 gt     ltimg srcassetsimgmenubtnalt.png altMenu data560opacity0 data580opacity1 gt   ltagt ltdivgt lt  End Mobile  gt codepre  pp  pAny thoughts on how to prevent this  Like I said, everything looks and works fine but Im noticing some minor lag on mobile and Im betting its bc the device is having to do the same calculations twice.p

Negative 8512 pI have 2 excel files at work where I maintain the rates of assets and the dates when the rates were issued. Another excel file has the list of assets and the dates when they were sold.p  pSo one excel file has the following columnsp  pre AssetRateRateIssuedOn 1. X150021Apr2014 2. X200028Aug2013 3. Z220011Jan2014 4. X30001Jan2014 pre  pThe other excel file has lets supposep  pre AssetSoldDate 1. X1Dec2013 2. Z12Mar2014 pre  pNow since the sold date of Asset X lies between 1Jan2014 and 28Aug2013 it should take the rate of 2000. If for example the sold date was 22Apr2014 it should take the rate as 1500. If the sold date is 27Aug2013 it should display a blank record. So basically the sold date should be greater than the latest Issued date and rate will correspond to that particular date.p  pI can easily get this working in excel but the problem is that the excel file has now become so large that it runs very slow. So I just want this incorporated in ms access. Is this possible I am a novice in ms access so kindly requesting you to go a little easy on mep  pThanksp
Negative 8512 pIm getting a little confused here between codeLocalDBcode and SQL Server Express. I have read from websites that codeLocalDBcode is an improved version of SQL Server Express a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combsqlexpressarchive20110712introducinglocaldbabettersqlexpress.aspxsourcea. I would assume this implies that codeLocalDBcode is replacing SQL Server Express. p  pThe confusing thing, however, is that it was also mentioned on several websites that codeLocalDBcode is only for development purposes, and its not meant for production use. p  pIn this case, I will do my development and testing of my web application with codeLocalDBcode on my computer. Since codeLocalDBcode is a replacement for SQL Server Express and also not for production use, then what database other than the full SQL Server if I dont have the money should I use when Im ready to publish my applicationp

The field can either be numeric or a timestamp value. A numeric value is recommended as a numeric value is more precise, portable, performant and easier to deal with than a timestamp.p  pTimestamp locking is frequently used if the table already has a last updated timestamp column, and is also a convenient way to auto update a last updated column. The timestamp version value can be more useful than a numeric version, as it includes the relevant information on when the object was last updated.p  pThe questions I have arep  ul lipIs better a Timestamp type if you are going to have a lastUpdated field or is better to have a numeric version field and the timestamp in other fieldpli lipBetween numeric types int, Integer, short, Short, long, Long which is the best to choose considering the length of each type I mean, I think the best is Long but it requires a lot of space for each row.pli lipWhat happens when the version field gets to the last number of a numeric type for example 32,767 in a Short field Will it start from 1 again in the next incrementpli ul

Negative 8512 pInside my activity I have a DrawerLayout . Its drawers ListView is populated using the MenuLVAdapter from below . There are only 5 items in the list . The individual items layout consists of a horizontal LinearLayout containing one ImageView on the left and one TextView on the right . The options names are within a string array resource, and the icons are drawable resources . Each drawable is an 128x128 transparent background png , about 7KB each .p  pThe problem is that while I am sliding the drawer , the animation is very choppy when the device renders the icons . Until then , the drawer slides as it should . The same choppyness occours both when opening  closing the drawer and when scrolling . Without the custom images using the stock androiddrawableicmenugallery icon , there is no lag whatsoever .p  pI have only tested this on a WVGA hTC Desire X packing a Dual Core 1GHz CPU amp 768MB RAM .

Negative 8512 pI have the following Scenario My codeMainWindowcode opens a codeSecondWindowcode on wich I process some codeInputcode in a seperate codeThreadcode. While the codeThreadcode is working the codeSecondWindowcode is closed and some kind of codeProgresscode for the codeThreadcode should be shown on the codeMainWindowcode. I have found many Tutorials which show how to Update the codeUIcode from another codeThreadcode if it is all on the same codeWindowcode. But not how to do that on two different codeWindowscode.br The codeMainWindowViemModelcode opens the codeSecondWindowcode like thisI know not codeMVVMcode  p  precodeNewAppointment na  new NewAppointment var result  na.ShowDialog if result  true      SelectedDate  SelectedDate  codepre  pOn my codeSecondWindowcode I have the codeMethodcode saveAppointment. When this codeMethodcode is finished, the codeSecondWindowcode will be closed and the codeMainWindowcode shown. Inside the saveAppointment I start a new codeThreadcode like thisp  precodenew Threadnew ParameterizedThreadStartcreateActionLogEntry.Startnew object[]  IncidentId, StartDate  codepre  pSo the codeThreadcode is doing his work in the Background and while he is doing this I want to show some Progressindicator on the codeMainWindowcode. How can I do thisp

Negative 8512 pfirst time poster here but lurker for a couple of months now. Currently indulging in C with a small amount of Java knowledge as well from prior Comp Sci courses at school. I apologize if some of you look at this and are disappointed since there are already questions about operator overloads, but I could not put together what exactly is wrong with my program going off of what I was able to find on here.p  pThis question in particular has to do with the  amp  operators. Ive done a couple of programs already in class that involved both of these overloads, and I didnt seem to have any difficulty making the program function properly however, there must be some distinct differences from these prior programs and my current one that Im failing to see that goes beyond my understanding of how each operator overload works. p  pThe error messages themselves make the issue seem almost too easy to fix as its just an operand matching issue apparently, but I still have been unable to find the correct syntax to correct these errors.

I had thought this would just create the object of student2Bill Miller, 0 essentially, but I must be wrong somewhere. I can only imagine that whatever rectifies this would then also rectify the operand issue with updating student1s grade when assigning a new variable based off its current assigned grade. Something tells me it could possibly just be how the function is structured at the moment, where perhaps the operator overload would need to be something similar to int Gradeoperatorconst Grade amp rather than Grade Gradeoperatorconst Grade amp, but all of my efforts to find the proper syntax so far have been futile.p  pAny direction you could point me in to better understand how to get out of the situation I am in would be absolutely excellent, just dont give me the answer straight outof course Seeing as this is an assignment for class, any suggestions should only pertain to Grade.cpp and Grade.h due to GradeMain being supplied by the instructor.p  pMany thanks for reading p

It seems like readingwriting the clients data and passing that data to and from the subprocesses would be unnecessary overhead.p  pThe Protocols are guaranteed to be TCP instances so I believe I can like the above code reduce the socket like thisp  precoderd  reducehandlemyclient.transport.fileno codepre  pUpon passing that data to a subprocess by looking at the Twisted source it seems I can reconstruct it in a subprocess now like thisp  precodeimport socket from twisted.internet import reactor, tcp from multiprocessing.reduction import reducehandle, rebuildhandle  handle  rebuildhandlerd sock  socket.fromfdhandle, socket.AFINET, socket.SOCKSTREAM protocol  MyProtocol... transport  tcp.Connectionsock, protocol, reactorreactor protocol.transport  transport codepre  pI would just try this, but seeing as Im not super familiar with the Twisted internals even if this works I dont really know what the implications might be.p  pCan anyone tell me whether this looks right and whether it would work Is this inadvisable for any some reason Ive never seen it mentioned in Twisted documentation or posts even though it seems quite relevant If this works, anything I should be wary ofp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 8512 pLets take the following programp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  int main      long t 57      printf[03ld], t  codepre  pand its outputp  precode[57] codepre  pI am somehow confused I told him to pad the output to width 3 code03ldcode, with zeroes, however it seems that if I force the output to put a plus sign before the number codecode it will not add the required zeroes if the length of the number is already 2 digits as in 57. For numbers lt10 it pads with 1 zero.p  pFrom a hrefhttpwww.cplusplus.comreferencecstdioprintf relnofollowhttpwww.cplusplus.comreferencecstdioprintfap  blockquote   p0  Leftpads the number with zeroes 0 instead of spaces when padding is specified see width subspecifier.p      p  Forces to preceed the result with a plus or minus sign  or  even for positive numbers. By default, only negative numbers are preceded with a  sign.p      pwidth  Minimum number of characters to be printed. If the value to be printed is shorter than this number, the result is padded with blank spaces. The value is not truncated even if the result is larger.p blockquote  pSo I just need a clarification ... The codewidthcode specifier from the quote above refers to the full length of the output string ie the characters that will be printed controlled by this format specifier code03ldcode or the full length of the characters of the number that is going to be printedp
Negative 8512 pI notice compilers generate code that targets SIMD registers every time codedoublecode arithmetic is used. This applies to nonoptimized as well as optimized code. Does this mean the x87 FP unit can be considered obsolete and only present for backward compatibility p  pI also notice that other popular platforms also rely on their respective SIMD implementations rather than FP designed as a stack.p  pAlso SIMD implementations tend to be at least 128bit wide, so I wonder does that mean the internal precision of operations is higher than for the x87 FP unitp  pI also wonder about performance, throughput and latency, considering that SIMD has been conceived with vector execution in mind, so I wonder how do they do with scalars.p

Negative 8512 pIm working with a searchampreplace programming assignment. Im a student and Im finding the regex documentation a bit overwhelming e.g. a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2libraryre.html relnofollowhttpsdocs.python.org2libraryre.htmla, so Im hoping someone here could explain to me how to accomplish what Im looking for. p  pIve used regex to get a list of strings from my document. They all look like thisp  precodeimport fileName regexStatement codepre  pAn actual examplep  precodeimport scriptexample.py  out .nreturn out codepre  pNow, Im wondering how I can split these up so I get the fileName and regexStatements as separate strings. Id assume using a regex or string split function, but Im not sure how to make it work on all kinds of variations of import fileName regexstatement. Splitting using parentheses could hit the middle of the regex statement, or if a parentheses is part of the fileName, for instance. The assignment doesnt specify if it should only be able to import from python files, so I dont believe I can use .py  as a splitting point before the regex statement either. p  pIm thinking something like a regex import  to hit the gap after import, ..  to hit the gap after fileName. But Im not sure how to get rid of the parentheses that encapsule the regex statement, or how to use all of it to actually split the string correctly so i have one variable storing fileName and one storing regexStatement for each entry in my list.p  pThanks a lot for your attentionp

Negative 8512 pThe latest Android Studio update seems to have changed the key repeat behavior for letters. For example, I cannot hold down i and have the character repeated. Instead, it wants to pop up a suggestion to insert a foreign language character. This is a major hindrance because I use the IdeaVIM keyboard scheme, and need to be able to hold down hjkl characters for moving the cursor more than one character. As it is, I have to tap the key repeatedly. I have looked around to find the preference to disable this character, but am unable to fish it out. p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 8512 pSo, we have been looking at creating an IApiFilter to do some pre and post information logging but we have come across an issue that looks to be a bug.p  pWe created a class that extends the ActionFilterAttribute System.Web.HttpFilters and, long story short, left its contents blank so that is merely inherited from its base classp  precodepublic class ApiLoggingFilter  ActionFilterAttribute, IApiFilterProvider   codepre  pWhen debugging we hit the OrchardApiActionFilterDispatcher Orchard.WebApi.Filters and the filter dispatches to codeactionFilter.ExecuteActionFilterAsync...codep  pThis shortly results in a StackOverflowException and since we have nothing new in our Filter, the issue must lie with the interaction between the dispatcher and the filter.p  pWhilst investigating this we came up with a couple of things pertinent. We also tried creating a class that extended codeExceptionFilterAttributecode and this functioned successfully. Digging into this area, we found a key difference between the two. codeIExceptionFiltercode which codeExceptionFilterAttributecode implements has the following signature on itp  precodeTask ExecuteExceptionFilterAsync     HttpActionExecutedContext actionExecutedContext,     CancellationToken cancellationToken  codepre  pWhere as codeIActionFiltercode which codeActionFilterAttributecode implements has a slightly extended signaturep  precodeTaskltHttpResponseMessagegt ExecuteActionFilterAsync     HttpActionContext actionContext,     CancellationToken cancellationToken,     FuncltTaskltHttpResponseMessagegtgt continuation  codepre  pThe big difference here is the codeFuncltTaskltHttpResponseMessagegtgt continuationcode that is passed in. Personally, I theorize that this is passed in as the sum of filter actions that have been decorated based on the following line codeOrchardApiActionFilterDispatchercodep  precodecontinuation   gt actionFilter.ExecuteActionFilterAsync     actionContext, cancellationToken, continuation  codepre  pConsequently, it appears to enter a filter and call continutaion from within the filter. Digging right down through some private methods in codeActionFilterAttributecode we ultimately findp  precodeHttpResponseMessage response  await continutaion codepre  pSeeing as this is the stack of all filter calls, calling this essentially calls the top of the filter stack again and makes the same call to the filter that was just made. This continues adinfinitum until we end up with a stack overflow.p  pDoes anyone at Orchard or out in the world of StackOverflow have any ideas on this matter Are we simply using these filter incorrectly Have we missed something Or is this just a bug that needs addressingp

Negative 8512 pWere new to Ember, and our intended embercli app first works by opening a project which we can think of a JSON object, and then acting on various sections of that project with various functions. We have this pick your project first approach neatly encapsulated in a Django REST api structure, e.g.p  ol licodeprojectscode lists all projectsli licodeprojects1code gives information about project 1li licodeprojects1sectionAcode list all elements in sectionA of project 1li licodeprojects1sectionA2code gives information about element 2 of sectionA in project 1li licodeprojects1sectionA2sectionB...code and so on.li ol  pWe made relatively good progress with the first two points in Ember using emberdata and codethis.storeproject.find...code etc. However, weve come unstuck trying to add further to our url e.g. points 3., 4., and 5..

However, we specifically want the project ID to be inside the URL, to remain stateless.li ol  pstrongBonus questions if relevantstrongp  ol lihow would we structure the models Do we need to use codehasManycodecodebelongsTocode and, if so, is this equivalent to just loading the whole project JSON in the first placeli lican emberdata handle such complex requests I.e. give me item 2 from sectionA of project 1 Can it do this in one go, or do there have to be nested queries i.e. first give me project 1 and then from this give me sectionA and then from this give me item 1li ol  pFinally, apologies if this is documented well somewhere.

Negative 8512 pI know this question has been asked a few times now, but i have a special case.p  pI have a class called JavaPlugin, a class called PluginLoader and an interface called InitializeAble. The PluginLoader has a Method which loads all classes, which extend from JavaPlugin and are contained in the JarFiles, which are contained in the FileFolder, which you give the loadingmethod as parameter.p  pSo after calling the loadmethod, you have a Setlt Classlt  extends JavaPlugin.br Also the class PluginLoader has the method initializePlugins, which runs through the Set and checks for every class if it implements InitializeAble. If the class implements the interface, a new instance of the class shall be created. And thats the point where i fail.br I would like to have a static method or a static field which has a method, which returns the JavaPlugininstance i want to createp  ul liI cant call any constructor because the person who created the class, which extends from JavaPlugin, might overwrote the default oneli liI cant force the class to implement a static method or field of an interfaceli liI cant make an Annotation, which forces a method to be static and to return a JavaPluginli liI dont want to define a method in JavaPlugin which must be overwritten, because i want to be able to make clear through an instance check, if the JavaPlugin is supposed to be initialized or not. For this i will check if PluginClass implements InitializeAbleli liI want the creator of the class, which extends JavaPlugin, to be able to write his own constructor, so he can decide what happens while the object is going to be createdli ul  pAs you can see, i tried it with constructor, annotation and interface. But i couldnt figure out a way which could work. The perfect thing would be an interface, which forces the class to declare publicprotectedprivate static JavaPlugin initialize. This method should be overwritten likebr codeinitialize  return new CustomPluginClass...  codep  pA publicprotectedprivate static Field would also be okay. I would create an interface for this field which has a public method which returns a JavaPlugin. This way i could get the field, call its method and get the instance. The interface Serializable does something like that with a long field, but i think thats a special thing and it is not possible to create something like this on your own.p  pMy last idea was to let the creator of the class, which extends JavaPlugin, the choice, which method in his pluginclass shall be his constructor by marking it with the annotation  PluginConstructor. But if i do so, i would have to make sure, that the marked method must return a JavaPlugin and must be static, because i cant call a notstatic method without an instance. I am not sure if something like that is possible, because i dont know much about annotations. Also there should be just 1 of the PluginConstructor annotations per class allowedp  pIf the costumpluginclass does not implement InitializeAble or it has no PluginConstructor annotation or whatever... if the plugin is not made to be initialized, it wont be. i would like to be able to check this with an instancecheck or an annotation. Thats why i dont want to make a method directly in JavaPlugin which can be overwrittenp  pIf there is another solution i would accept it, too. As long as i get this problem solved. I have no idea anymore how i could do this. Hope you can help mep  pthanks, bastibr ps yes, i looked over all similar questions and no, those didnt help me and sorry for bad english Pp  pEDIT I want to write the whole thing on my own to get some practice with reflection. But it is no problem for me if there is no reflection used in this part. Just want to know how to make sure, that the libraryuser cant mark the plugin as initializeable without having kind of a constructor i can load without risking to access something which is might not therep

Negative 8512 pAfter having done some research, I believe I am asking the same question as stackoverflow.comquestions22359315. I have encountered the same issue, but I believe the answers in that thread were insufficient as the question was not clearly explained. Please see belowp  pIn a RichTextBox, how do I strongremovestrong a custom BackColor from some, but not all, of the text SelectionBackColor so that it assumes the BackColor of the control strongeven if that BackColor changes in the futurestrongp  pI have a method that highlights some text and changes its BackColor using SelectionBackColor. I have another method that changes the BackColor of the entire control. These events can happen independently.p  pIf I want to remove some SelectionBackColor, I can try to set the SelectionBackColor to Color.Transparent, but it ends up being White. That is fine, temporarily, if my RichTextBoxs strongcurrentstrong BackColor is White. If I set SelectionBackColor to the current BackColor, it is fine temporarily, stronguntil that BackColor changes from another method.strongp  pAfter the RichTextBox.BackColor has changed, any places that were previously highlighted use White or the previous BackColor, instead of assuming the new color like text that had not previously highlighted.p  pI have tried deleting and replacing the text, but that negates the ability to retain any other custom formatting of that text, to my knowledge. Setting SelectionBackColor to null does not work.p  pOne can easily see what I am talking about using the code belowp  precodeprotected override void OnLostFocusEventArgs e      base.OnLostFocuse     this.BackColor  Color.Gray     if SelectionLength gt 0              SelectionBackColor  Color.Yellow        protected override void OnGotFocusEventArgs e      base.OnGotFocuse     this.ResetBackColor     if SelectionLength gt 0               The goal of this line is to remove the yellow.          By assigning it any value, it seems to have lost          the ability to use the controls BackColor normally.         SelectionBackColor  this.BackColor or Color.Transparent       codepre  pType some text into a custom RichTextBox object with the code above, highlight a small portion of it, then make the box lose focus. You will see the highlighted text in yellow. Then, make the box gain focus. The yellow background will go away, as expected. However, if you move your caret elsewhere in the text and make the control lose focus again, you will see the previouslyhighlighted text does not assume the gray background color.p

Negative 8512 pOn a blog of mine, a user asked me if I could tell him his password from that account, which happens to be the same password he used on multiple accounts, on an email which was deactived  the point is he needs that specific password.p  pSince the only option in the Wordpress Dashboard is to change the password, I had to look in phpmyadmin, under wpusers table at his password. The things is, the password is encrypted unde wordpresss unique encoding hash, phpass I believe, since it starts with PB. If it was 2008 again and wordpress wouldve used MD5 to enconde password in sql tables, it would have been easier.p  pFrom my knowledge I know that phpass pasword cant be decrypted, naturally, since its a oneway encryption method. The only way would be to bruteforce it, which is out of the question.p  pAnd then, I thought about resending the user an email containing the password. I searched the plugins page and found one named Resend Welcome email which still resets it eventualy. I think that this method is plausable, because, if I change the password in the wpusers table with another one encoded in phpass, he can login with the new one, so Wordpress somehow verifies it by encoding or decoding it, or by enconding it and comparing the hash of the password entered with the one already present in the wpusers table, under that users row.p  pIs there a plugin available or a turnaround to this situations I overthinked the whole situation and now Im out of solutions which are in my league of knowledge.p

Negative 8512 pI was recently developing a socket based system using Lua which was quickly turning into a web server , I wrote a small API which is tightly coupled with the socket logic and I found myself with everything that I needed to have a full fledged API service without worrying about everything else that a conventional web server is usually bundled with. Since I was using OpenID I discovered I dont need a cookie parser in the server logic and since I was only serving JSON data , I skipped implementing file management utilities which by the way are almost 30 of any decent server design.p  pI think what I developed ended up being a small framework that serves my JSON API , I stress tested the code and I could do up to 10K connection simultaneously since I was am asynchronous sockets and the load on the development computer was alright by me.p  pIs it advisable to design this way , I mean I cannot get any good examples from companies that do this from a quick google search but I am sure there are those who do this. I am impressed by the simplicity that I got and the quick design time, most of the time I have to study complex web server internal things in order to accomplish such a task but having written everything incrementally , I seriously discovered that the learning curve is much shorter.p  pMy entire code base is reasonably small excluding the Lua runtime and I can run a twitter like micro blogging service with exemplary error handling via the API. I am now designing the API frontend which will run on a full fledged web server NGINX ... I would really like to know if Implementing the API backend on a dedicated custom stack is the best way to go or maybe I am setting myself up for some pretty crazy surprises in the long run.p

Negative 8512 pI have a mapview that displays your route traveled in a car, and has a seekbar that allows you to move along the path, displaying a map marker at each location with the speed on it. These map markers Bitmaps are generated at runtime since the speeds need to be placed on them. The problem I am having is that a trip may have hundreds of locations that require a new map marker Bitmap to be generated. I am currently creating a new bitmap for each location in an AsyncTask. For a long trip, the app force closes due to an OutOfMemoryError. I need a way to swap out the text on the map markers so that I can create 1 Bitmap. Any helpadvice is greatly appreciated.p

It seems that by looking at the date from the result it can only return the result from 9 days before There are arguments called codesincecode and codeuntilcode which are used to specify time range. But they dont work.p  pSo Im thinking is there a way to get information for all of this topic Or at least I can take control date range.p  pApart from this.

Negative 8512 pI am trying to figure out the best approach to apply some custom processing on Python logging messages with minimal impact to our codebase.p  pThe problem is this we have many different projects logging a lot of things, and among these can be found some AWS keys. As a security requirement, we need to strip out all AWS keys from the logs, and there are multiple ways to go about thisp  ul liThe naive approach would be to go in each and every project, and modify each logging call to manually strip out keys. This is the least preferred approach as it would be the most manual.li liImplement a different module that provides the same function as the codeloggingcode module like codeinfocode, codeerrorcode, ... and each function definition would first apply a regex to filter out AWS keys, and then call the actual codeloggingcode method behind the scenes. Then each project can be modified to something like codeimport customloggingmodule as loggingcode and none of the logging calls need to be modified. The drawback of this approach though is that it looks like every logging call comes from this module in the log, so you cant track where your messages originate from.li liNot sure in what form yet, but it sounds like it would be possible to implement a custom codeLoggercode or codeLogRecordcode and register it when initializing the logging. This wouldnt have the problems of the previous approach.li ul  pI have done some research on approach 3 but couldnt really find a way to do this. Does anyone have experience applying some custom processing on logging messages that would apply to this use casep

So basically, what would be the best way about setting the specific 131px size for the figure and then making the figcaption exactly aligned with the image when I set the text to align in the centerp  pImage of Problem  a hrefhttpi.imgur.coms3aoUqb.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.coms3aoUqb.pnga The Figure is not aligned at all with the imagep  pHTMLp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt  lthead langengt     ltmeta charsetUTF8gt     lttitlegtLakeside Bookslttitlegt     ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefmasterstyle.cssgt     ltmeta nameviewsize contentwidthdevicewidth,initialscale1.0gt      lt[if IE]gt     ltscript typetextjavascript srchttphtml5shiv.googlecode.comsvntrunkhtml5.jsgtltscriptgt     lt[endif]gt  ltheadgt  ltbodygt ltdiv idwrappergt     ltdiv idsidebargt         ltnav idnavgt             lth3 idwelcometextgtWelcome ToltbrgtLakeside Bookslth3gt             ltdiv idsearchbargt                 ltform actionhttpwww.example.comsearch.phpgt                     ltinput typetext namesearch placeholder...Search Book Titlegt                 ltformgt             ltdivgt             ltulgt                 ltligt                     lta classlinkgt                         Home                     ltagt                 ltligt                 ltligt                     lta classlinkgt                         Categories                     ltagt                 ltligt                 ltligt                     lta classlinkgt                         Bestsellers                     ltagt                 ltligt                 ltligt                     lta classlinkgt                         Contact                     ltagt                 ltligt             ltulgt         ltnavgt     ltdivgt      ltdiv idsectiononegt         ltdiv idcontaineronegt             ltdiv idheadergt                 ltdiv idlogogt                     lth1gtLAKESIDE BOOKSlth1gt                     ltpgtKERRYS LOCAL BOOKSTOREltpgt                 ltdivgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt      ltdiv idsectiontwogt         ltdiv idcontainertwogt             lth2 idsectwoheadgtBest Selling Books Right Nowlth2gt                 ltdiv idbestsellerimagesgt                     ltfiguregt                         ltimg srcImages4.jpg altbook1 height200 width131gt                         ltfigcaptiongtThe Girl On The Train  Paula Hawkinsltfigcaptiongt                     ltfiguregt                     ltfiguregt                         ltimg srcImages3.jpg altbook2 height200 width131gt                     ltfiguregt                     ltfiguregt                         ltimg srcImages5.jpg altbook1 height200 width131gt                     ltfiguregt                 ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt  ltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pCSSp  precodehtml, body         margin0     padding0     height100     width100  body      backgroundcolor fdfdfd     fontfamily Arial, Open Sans, sansseriflight, sansserif, Segoe UI  wrapper      width 100     height 100     margin0 0 0 20     sidebar      backgroundcolor 212528     position fixed     width 20     height 100     top 0     left 0     overflow hidden  nav      color DADADA     display block     maxwidth 100  nav ul      paddingleft 0  nav li      liststyletype none     margin 0     padding 0.75em 0 0.75em 0     textalign center     maxwidth 100  nav lihover      background333  nav li a      display block     padding 0.5em 0  .link      textalign right     marginright 25     letterspacing 1px  welcometext      textalign center     fontstyle italic     texttransform uppercase     fontsize 1em     margintop 2em  searchbar      width 70     marginleft auto     marginright auto     padding 1em 1em 0.5em 1em     textalign right  searchbar input      maxwidth 95  sectionone      position fixed     top 0     right 0     width 80  containerone      margintop 0     width 80     height 100     marginleft auto     marginright auto     textalign center     borderbottom 2px solid DADADA     boxshadow inset 0 6px 0 0 fdfdfd, inset 0 8px 0 0 DADADA  header      margin 6em 0 6em 0  logo h1      color ed786a     textshadow 0.1em 0.1em 0 rgba0, 0, 0, 0.1     letterspacing 13px  logo p      margintop 0.6em     color 888888     letterspacing 4px     fontsize 0.85em  sectiontwo      width 80     top 0     right 0  containertwo      width 80     height 100     marginleft auto     marginright auto     textalign center  sectwohead     margin 2em 0 2em 0     color 888888  bestsellerimages     float left     display inlineblock     width 100     maxwidth 100     margin 0 0 2em 0  bestsellerimages img     padding 0 1em 0 1em  bestsellerimages figure     display inlineblock     width 131px  codepre

Negative 8512 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pSome time ago I worked on a Java ServerClient application Building automatization was the scope. After a first try, where we wrote both the server and the client in java and connected them over java RMI Remote Method Interface, we found that writing the client in Javascript would be better for several reasons I wont give them here, do not matter.p  pAs RMI does not work between Javascript and Java, We then used WebSockets to connect them and get a nearly realtime connection. This was about 3 years ago, websockets were still in early beta with absolutely no documentation and many not yet implemented functions. For the protocool part, I wrote something like an own JSON based RMI. I deserialized the JSON objects coming from the client and queried my own server application using java.lang.reflection to get the methods the client wanted to execute. p  pAll that worked good, I had it fairly generic, so I could insert other subclasses dynamically at runtime and my RMI would still be able to access them.p  pstrongTLDRstrongp  pI always wondered if there is a standard way to connect java to javascript in something like a RMI like having to extend some interface and being then able to access those interface methods with javascript I cant be the first one having that issue.p  pTo myself I am an electrical engineer, so Java, Javascript or Web technologies in general are nothing I have learned in university. I do know what I talk about when it comes to java, but I am a complete noob to javascript.p

Negative 8512 pI am writing a notification client desktop application to be installed on multiple machines on a single network.  These clients will communicate with a central windows service running on a single machine within the same network.  Both the client and service are written in C.Net.  I am trying to determine what technologies or frameworks I should use for communication between the client apps and the windows service.  I hope to use a push notification pattern instead of polling from the client.p  pSo far I have looked into SignalR and WCF.  WCF with NamedPipes looked promising, but I saw that a limitation of the WCF NamedPipes implementation is that it has to be on the same machine, so that wont work for me.  SignalR seems like a good option, but I wasnt sure if there is another framework out there that wont require hosting a web server to support HTTP.p  pAny Suggestionsp
Negative 8512 pIt seems clear that Apollo has support for CORS in their websockets protocol, but I can find nothing comparable in ActiveMQ. In Apollo you can add the parameter corsorigin to the connector description, but I can find nothing comparable in ActiveMQs documentation. Ive tried the Apollo parameter but Im still getting connection refused errors. p  pIm attempting to use the Paho Mqtt javascript client to connect. The Go clients Ive written work fine over both tcp and websockets, but Ive had no luck getting the js client to work. p  pIm pretty sure the problem is CORS. Any ideas on how to configure ActiveMQp

Negative 8512 pIm new to Three.js and wondering how exactly positioning works, any why is my icicle graph so scaterred.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQAZyJ.jpg altscattered icicle graphp  pThe parent starts at [0,0], which is directly in the center of the object WHY it isnt in the TOPLEFT corner. Al the other cfirst children in each level are also positioned at [0,parentLevelHeight], which is exactly same situation.p  p[X,Y] positions are calculated for 2D world, which fits just fine, but the centering thing happening in Three.js is unsolvable for me at the moment. Can, please, anybody explain me how does it work p  pThank you for your time and reply.p  pPS AxisHelper img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdZIZT.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 8512 pHello electric friends p  pIn Imagemagick I want to compose images from 2 folders with the same number but different name.

Negative 8512 pI have a class implemented in C that I want to use from a native application.

Negative 8512 pI have a question about API and autoresponders.p  pIm using 2 different campaigns campaign A doesnt have an autoresponder while B does. Im also using the movecontact API to move the same contact from campaign A to campaign B via my website. I mean, the contact when he subscribes is on campaign A then, after some days, I use the movecontact API to move the contact from campaign A to B.p  pThe first time it works fine. In fact when the contact is moved to campaign B for the first time the autoresponder starts, but If I move the same contact back to campaign A and then I move the same contact back to campaign B the autoresponder doesnt start.p  pI mean that the autoresponder starts only the first time that the contact is moved to campaign B. If I move the contact to campaign C and then I move back the same contact to campaign B the autoresponder doesnt start as it should.p  pI need to switch the same contact from a campaign to another various times, and everytime the contact goes back to campaign B I need the same autoresponder to start again. I did several tests but it only works the first time I move the contact to a specific campaign.p  pHeres a piece of my php codep  precode MOVE CONTACT resultapi  clientgtmovecontact apikey,     array      contact gt contactid,     campaign gt campaignid         SET CYCLE resultsetapi  clientgtsetcontactcycle apikey,     array      contact gt contactid,     cycleday gt 0       codepre  pcontactid is the ID of the contact in getresponse and campaignid is the id of the campaign where I want to move the contact. Both are calculated previously in the code. setcontactcycle is the API to set the autoresponder to day 0.p  pThis code moves the contact from campaign A to campaign B, it sets the autoresponder to day 0 correctly and the first email of the autoresponder is sent I received it after 35 minutes. But if later I use the same code to move back the same from campaign B to campaign A and then I use again the same code to move back the contact from campaign A to campaign B thats what it happensp  pthe contact is moved correctly and now stays in campaign B good, the autoresponder is set again to day 0 good but the email is not sent bad. I mean, it works everything but the delivery of the email.p  pI did several tests with different email addresses, I waited hours to receive the emails but no results I received the email of the autoresponder only the first time I moved a contact to campaign B the one with the autoresponder. But, as I said, from the second time I move a contact to campaign B the email is not sent anymore, even If in getresponse dashboard I see that the contact is in the right campaign with the day of the autoresponder set correctly to 0.p  pAm I doing something worng Is there a mistake in my php code Do I need to add extra lines or functions to start and restart the autoresponder for the same contact everytime I want p  pThanksp

Negative 8512 pIve been working with bluez 5.30 for a few weeks getting a peripheral working using the DBus APIs.  I ran into a bug registering descriptors which I tracked down to an issue in gattdatabase.c.  When I went to report the bug, I noticed 5.31 had been released, which corrected the issue, so I built and installed the new version. p  pHowever, in this new version the LEAdvertisingManager1 has disappeared from the adapter object.  Downgrading back to 5.30 corrects the issue.  I start bluetoothd with the E option in both cases.p  pWhen I start bluetoothd from the command line with debugging on, I can see the device wishes to create the interfacep  precodebluetoothd[1801] srcadvertising.cbtdadvertisingmanagernew LE Advertising Manager created for adapter orgbluezhci0 codepre  pThe only clue appears to be this linep  precode bluetoothd[1801] Failed to read advertising features Unknown Command 0x01 codepre  pWhich i tracked down to the call to read MGMTOPREADADVFEATURES over hci, which returns 0x01, unknown command.  This command was working fine in 5.30, so Im curious if this is some configuration issue for the new features in 5.31.  p  pAnyone have any tips for correcting thisp

Negative 8512 pI have a project which contains a bunch of small programs tied together using bash scripts, as per the Unix philosophy. Their exchange format originally looked like thisp  precodemeta1ameta1bmeta1c AST1 meta2ameta2bmeta2c AST2 codepre  pWhere the codecodeseparated fields are metadata and the codeASTcodes are sexpressions which the scripts pass along asis. This worked fine, as I could use codecut d  code to split the metadata from the ASTs, and codecut d code to dig into the metadata. However, I then needed to add a metadata field containing spaces, which breaks this format. Since no field uses tabs, I switched to the followingp  precodemeta1ameta1bmeta1cmeta 1 dtAST1 meta2ameta2bmeta2cmeta 2 dtAST2 codepre  pSince I envision more metadata fields being added in the future, I think its time to switch to a more structured format rather than playing a game of guess the punctuation.p  pInstead of delimiters and codecutcode I could use JSON and codejqcode, or I could use XML and codexsltproccode, but since Im already using sexpressions for the ASTs, Im wondering if theres a nice way to use them here insteadp  pFor example, something which looks like thisp  precodeecho foo1 bar1 baz1 quux 1 ast1  echo foo2 bar2 baz2 quux 2 ast2  sexpr caar  foo1 foo2 codepre  pMy requirements arep  ul liStraightforward use of stdio with minimal boilerplate, since thats where my programs readwrite their datali liEasily callable from shell scripts strongorstrong provide a emveryem compelling alternative to bashs process invocation and pipeliningli liStreaming IO if possible ie.

Negative 8512 pI am trying to run a simple SQL query through the PHP odbc drivers. Sparing you the irrelevant details, the query is dynamically generated through an engine we have built, obviously, in PHP.

CASE WHEN foo   THEN .... codepre  pStill no luck. If I take the parameter out of the equation by surrounding the  with quotes so it literally takes a question mark as a value, or by simply passing another codefoocode, it works. If I run the query through SQL Management Studio, it works. So its clearly something to do with how the odbc PHP driver handles the prepared parameter. But I cant find any bug reports, or similarly reported problems anywhere on the net. Has anyone experienced this before andor have a solutionp

Negative 8512 pI want to create a static function pointer array, so I can jump to a certain function regarding a received index. Like an index jumper.p  pSo imagine a class like thisp  precodeClass A      private   static void 1stFunction   static void 2ndFunction    static voidfunctionPointer[20]void   codepre  pThen I would like that functionPointer to get the value of the 1stFunction and 2ndFunction, and maybe even more. So, how do I initialize it As far as I know, when a static member is declared, you can use it even before an instance is created. So I though, lets initialize that function pointer, so later I can call it like thisp  precodefunctionPointer[receivedIndex] codepre  pSo i tried to initilize it like this, in the same .h filep  precodevoid AfunctionPointer[]void       A1stFunction,     A2ndFunction,  codepre  pBut the compiler gives me redifinition, it says its already created.p  pSo, pretty sure Im missing something. I dont know though, if it is syntax or simply it is not possible to do it this way. I know that function pointers to classs member functions are different than normal function pointers... But this is a static function, so I believe it doesnt belong to an instance and therefore it should work with normal function pointers.p  pAny help would be appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 8512 pIm playing around with functionaltacit style programming, specifically creating the snake game example of game a hrefhttppatorjk.comgamessnake relnofollowhttppatorjk.comgamessnakeap  pThe specific question is that Im taking an array of strings likep  precode[  [2 ],  [10] ] codepre  pand wanting to get the list of coordinates in numerical order of the value.

Negative 8512 pAs part of our project we are using Spring Data on top of Elastic Search. We found very interesting issue with findBy queries. If we pass string that contains space it didnt find the right element unless we pad the string with quotes. For example for getByNameString name we should pass getByNameJohn Do. Is there any way to eliminate such redundant paddingp  pThank you Moshep
Negative 8512 pI am working on a rails project. I need to call a tracking function named trackEvent on scroll of the home page. p  precodeltsection classfeaturessection cardsection borderbc onwheeltrackEventHomePage Scroll,Scroll,Features Sectiongtltsectiongt codepre  pThis trackEvent function is being used to track events through out the website in all the pages, so it is written in the common javascript file which has been included in the assetpipeline of rails.p  pThe thing is, once the home page html loads strongthe javascript hasnt been loaded yetstrong, and I start scrolling, the on wheel event is triggered, but the trackEvent function comes to be strongundefinedstrong. p  pThis happens in other cases as well, the scroll case is just one example.p  pOne workaround we have been using is checking if jQuery has loaded since jQuery is also included in the assetpipeline by embedding a script like the following in all the html viewsp  precodefunction checkJquery    if window.jQuery        trackEventHomePage Scroll,Scroll,Features Section        or some other task    else        window.setTimeoutcheckJqueryoutstanding, 1000     checkJquery codepre  pThis script ensures that the function is called only after it has loaded.p  pBut it has become kind of tedious, including these setTimeouts in all the views.

In my file, some lines have numbers and some have words and I want the lines that only have numbers.p  pSo, in my Python application, I have these lines.p  precodel  sc.textFilemyfilepath lfiltered  l.filterlambda s s[0].isdigit codepre  pwhich works exactly as I want.p  pThis is what I have tried so far.p  precodeval l  sc.textFilemyfilepath val lfiltered  l.filterx gt x.forall.isDigit codepre  pThis throws out an error saying that char does not have forall function.p  pI also tried taking the first character of the lines using s.take1 and apply isDigit function on that in the following way.p  precodeval l  sc.textFilemyfilepath val lfiltered  l.filterx gt x.take1.isDigit codepre  pand this too...p  precodeval l  sc.textFilemyfilepath val lfiltered  l.filterx gt x.take1.Character.isDigit codepre  pThis also throws an error.p  pThis is basically a small error and as I am not accustomed to Scala syntax, I am having hard time figuring it out. Any help would be appreciated.p  pEdit As answered for this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9938098howtochecktoseeifastringisadecimalnumberinscalaquestiona, I tried writing the function, but I am unable to use that in filter function in my application. strongTo apply the function for all the lines in the file.strongp
Negative 8512 pI have a page which lists all the files in a server folder with a checkbox each. It works fine except the last 3 lines of code where I want it to reload the whole page.

Negative 8512 pA question about Drupal 7s module xmlsitemap  p  pIve created a content type and set it to be excluded from the sitemap.

Is there a way to do it p
Negative 8512 pSo it took me a bit to set up a repl set with SSL and authorization. However, I have it set up and working finally, and can connect via command line providing the appropriate parameters. Im trying to do the same thing with mongoose, however I keep getting an error in the mongodb logs, as follows codeAssertionException handling request, closing client connection 17189 The server is configured to only allow SSL connectionscode Even though I specified all the ssl options.p  pMy code is as follows p  precodevar m  requiremongoose  var key  fs.readFileSynchomenodemongodbmongodb.pem var ca  [fs.readFileSynchomenodemongodbca.pem]  var o       server          sslValidatetrue,         sslCA ca,         sslKey key,         sslCertkey     ,     user ,     pass    m.connectmongodbdbAddrdbName, o codepre  pIve tried setting sslValidate to codefalsecode, same issue. Ive tried without CA, cert, andor key in multiple combinations. When I connect via command line it requires me to provide CA, and keycert PEM file. So I figured the mongoose client would require these as well. Ive tried both codeservercode and codereplsetcode keys with the same exact outcome. Ive even specified authSourceauthDB, even though it appears this is not part of the problem, this still yields the same results.p  pIm really confused especially since I have no problem doing this exact same thing via the codemongocode command.p  pMy mongo shell command is as follows p  precodemongo host db1 ssl sslPEMKeyFile etcmongodbmongodb.pem  sslCAFile etcmongodbca.pem u  p  authenticationDatabase dbName codepre

Negative 8512 pI have an HTML file that displays data with an image overlay form. p  pThe image is called in the HTML using the followingp  precodeltIMG classimgprintclass srcservernameblahblahblah.PNGgt ltIMG classimgviewclass srcservernameblahblahblah.PNGgt codepre  pAll users can display the document correctly. But, for certain users, the image overlay does not print, only the data.  p  pThere seems to be something tied to the user login profile that is impacting whether or not the overlay prints.  It is not a security access issue, because the affected users are able to navigate to the server that stores the image and rightclick print it.  So, they have the security rights required to access the image.p  pIs there something in the windows profile that would affect this  Any ideasp
Negative 8512 pI found a gist that enables drawing tools and gives the ability to choose from a few colors to draw on a google map a hrefhttpsgist.github.comHagith5765919 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comHagith5765919ap  pIm trying to utilize this with socket.io so that multiple people can be viewing a map, and when one person draws something onto the map, all of the people can see what is drawn.p  pIve got the basic idea down with markers by doing p  precodesocket.emitmarker, e.overlay.position codepre  pWhen a marker is placed, however, with rectangles, polygons, and circles, it seems a bit harder. When I log out the click event on the map with any of those shapes, the data that it gives back seems way more complicated than what it gave back with marker and I cant find the coordinates for the points that I need to be able to broadcast to the other users. Does anyone know where to find these in the context of the gist abovep  pEdit Ive been able to find the center with codee.overlay.j.centercodep
