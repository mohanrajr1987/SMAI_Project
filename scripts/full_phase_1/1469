Positive 1469 pI would like to select all characters in a Powerpoint textbox Version 2010 that have a certain defined style e.g. all bold characters. Manually, one can create a noncontiguous text selection in a single text box by simply holding the control key while selecting. With VBA, I failed so far.

I end up with just the last bold character being selected.p  pThe selection itself is what I want as end result to give the user the option to further modify the font etc. p  pDoes anyone have a suggestion or is this not at all accessible via VBAp  pThanks a lotp

So that I will have a list of top 50 keywords for the three fields, and there will be 150 unique words.p  precodelibrarytm  reviews lt read.csv 1Keywords.csv, stringsAsFactorsFALSE strreviews reviewtext lt pastereviews, collapse  reviewsource lt VectorSourcereviewtext corpus lt Corpusreviewsource corpus lt tmmapcorpus, tolower  corpus lt tmmapcorpus, removePunctuation corpus lt tmmapcorpus, stripWhitespace corpus lt tmmapcorpus, removeWords, stopwordskind  en corpus lt tmmapcorpus, stemDocument  dtm lt DocumentTermMatrixcorpus dtm2 lt as.matrixdtm frequency lt colSumsdtm2 frequency lt sortfrequency, decreasingTRUE frequency[sort.listfrequency, decreasingTRUE[150]] codepre  pOuput of headreviewsp  precodePERFORMANCE.PAY..LEVEL.EVIDENCE..PRODUCTIVITY..HIERARCHIES..AUTHORITY..DECENTRALIZATION..COORDINATION..INEQUALITY..DELEGATION..KNOWLEDGE 1                                                                                                               NETWORK REVENUE MANAGEMENT 2                                              RANDOM YIELDS SYSTEMS DEMAND MARKET OPTIMIZATION EQUILIBRIUM COMMODITIES FORMULATION 3                                                                               SPONSORED SEARCH DESIGN INFORMATION EXCHANGES INTERNET 4                                                                                                        GAMES MECHANISM SELLERS DESIGN 5                         CORPORATEINVESTMENT SPINOFFS DEBT INTEGRATION MANAGEMENT INNOVATION VALUATION PROJECTS MERGERS CHOICE 6                                 WAGE DYNAMICS CEO COMPENSATION PAY PERFORMANCE DIRECTORS TURNOVER INCENTIVES CONTRACTS MANAGERS codepre

BOTH TRANSMITTER and RECEIVER uses ARM7  LPC2148. p  pNow my idea is to have the 8 BIT WAVE FILE stored in SDCARD of Android Device and transmit the same at specified frequency using timer.p  pI wanted to know how to do this. I tried the above method but I do understand that the transmission frequency does not match as I needed. PORT OPENED AT 230400 baud rate.p  pWith the above code, a 155 KB File should take approximately 67 seconds to finish up the transmission character by character. But it really takes about 1520 seconds and I dont have the audio output at the receiver end. Just the noise.p  pKindly advise me and give some ideas on how to do it in realtime just like the way I managed to do it in ARM7.p  pThanks a Lotp

Positive 1469 pI developed a Java printer application such that a kitchen POS printer thermal printer will print out incoming orders if new order came in the cloud database.p  pI developed and tested everything on my Mac 2011 Macbook Pro, Yosemite. Seems working well. After that, I was trying to deploy this application in a Ubuntu 14.04, p  pThe problem is that  The starting point of the text is about half inch to the left edge of the thermal paper, but everything looks good using my mac.p  pAdditional Information 1. IntelliJ IDE, Java 1.6 compiler on Mac, and OpenJDK 1.6 on Ubuntu 2. Modified these two parameters Paperformat.getImageableX and drawStringtestString, x, y, both modifications of parameters failed to push the text to the left boarder of the paper.p  pIm wondering if some Java expert could show me a way out. Thanksp

Positive 1469 pso Im making a game that uses nothing but the console in my java IDE, but I have a problem using delays. My goal is to create a method that when taken a text passed though the parameters, it prints it letter by letter with a delay of 50. Kind of like the text in the Pokemon series, how it scrolls though each letter.p  pThe problem I have is lag. Im running an amd fx8350 cpu 4GHz, 4 cores4 virtual cores. Whenever I change the delay amount to anything around and under 100 milliseconds, the console prints half a word, then a little bit of the other half, then half the sentence, then maybe a character, etc.p  pIve tried this code here it works, but with lagp  precodepublic void scrollString text     int delay  50     ActionListener action  new ActionListener              int counter  text.length         Override         public void actionPerformedActionEvent event                      ifcounter  0                              timer.stop                          else                              System.out.printtext.substringtext.length  counter, text.length  counter  1                 counter                                timer  new Timerdelay, action     timer.start  end scroll codepre  pAnd this code as well also works, with same amount of lagp  precodepublic void scrollString text     forint i  0 i lt text.length i        try                 Thread.sleep1000             catchInterruptedException ex                Thread.currentThread.interrupt                     System.out.printtext.substringi, i  1      end scroll codepre  pIn conclusion, Im guessing that the computer is doing more than delaying when I try to delay the thread.

Negative 1469 pFor my internship on BrainComputer Interfacing I need to generate some very fast flickering squares on a CRT monitor flickering  alternating between two colors. The monitors refresh rate is 85Hz and we would like this to be the bottleneck, which means that repainting all squares can take at most 100085  11ms.p  pMy language of preference for GUIgraphics programming is Java, so I tried making a prototype with AWT, because its synchronous unlike Swing. I now seem to have two problems the first is that time measurements show that the repainting of even 9 squares simply takes too long. My algorithm takes the desired frequency and calculates the times at which the system should repaint in advance and then uses a loop with no sleepwait delay that checks everytime if the next time was reached and if so, loops through all the squares to repaint them. The way I implemented it now is that the squares are Panels with background color A and are contained in another Panel with background color B and the flickering happens because the Panels visibility is changed. I figured that this would be faster than one Panel that has to draw Rectangles all the time. I dont have a decent profiling tool cant get Eclipse TPTP or NetBeans profiler to work so I cant be sure, but I have the feeling that the bottleneck is actually not in the repainting, but in the looping with conditional checking etc.. Can you recommend anything about what I should dop  pThe second problem is that it seems like the squares are rendered toptobottom. Its like they unroll really fast, but still visibly. This is unacceptable. What Im wondering though, is what causes this. Is it JavaAWT, or Windows, or just me writing a slow algorithmp  pCan you recommend some things for me to try I prefer to use Java, but I will use C or something if I must. In this case, are there any frameworkslibrariestutorials for this sort of 2D programming that you can recommendp

Negative 1469 pIm writing out some xml from C using the .net frameworks XmlTextWriter. This works ok. Some of the strings I write out contain the character value 5 note I dont mean the character 5, but I mean the ascii value 5.p  pNow, I understand from the xml specification that this character is illegal in xml. However, I dont care if its illegal, I want it in my xml nonconforming document. This is so that I can write a string that can potentially contain some binary data to the document.p  pOk, so System.Xml.XmlTextWriter will write these illegal xml characters ok, and encodes it in the xml as codeamp5xcode. But then, I want to read them in a C app by using MSXML2.SAXXMLReader.6.0. This parser raises a fatalError when it encounters one of these characters.p  pIve tried modifiying some of the properties of the parser to get it to work. It was my understanding that IE used this parser internally, and I can load the illegal xml with IE ok. So, how does IE manage to parse it when I cant.p  pAm I missing something Does IE use a different parser. Is there a way I can get the MSXML2.SAXXMLReader.6.0 parser to work Will I need to use a different parser if so, can you recommend one that has the source code available so I can fix it up if it doesnt do what I wantp  pThere is a property I can set on the .Net parser to allow these illegal characters to be parsed.

Negative 1469 pIm facing a parameter selection problem, which I would like to solve using Genetic Algorithm GA. Im supposed to select not more than 4 parameters out of 3000 possible ones. Using the binary chromosome representation seems like a natural choice. The evaluation function punishes too many selected attributes and if the number of attributes is acceptable, it then evaluates the selection.p  pThe problem is that in these sparse conditions the GA can hardly improve the population. Neither the average fitness cost, nor the fitness of the worst individual improves over the generations. All I see is slight even tiny improvement in the score of the best individual, which, I suppose, is a result of random sampling.p  pEncoding the problem using indices of the parameters doesnt work either. This is most probably, due to the fact that the chromosomes are directional, while the selection problem isnt i.e. chromosomes [1, 2, 3, 4] [4, 3, 2, 1] [3, 2, 4, 1] etc. are identicalp  pWhat problem representation would you suggestp  pP.S If this matters, I use a hrefhttppyevolve.sourceforge.net relnofollowPyEvolvea.p

Negative 1469 pI am writing a class to handle security in my executable checking serials, trial date check etc. After I compile the executable even in Release build, with all debug and RTTI generation turned off, when I open it in NotePad and search the method name in the raw data, I can see all the names of the methods that assemble my class. There are no published members in any class in the code base.p  pThis is bad for protection. Is there any way to tell Delphi not to store method names in the executable  Why is it storing them at all if there is no RTTI needed and no COM explosion Is there any compiler option controlling thisp  pIt may be that ANY method of ANY class in the target executable is stored inside the executable in text form.

Negative 1469 pI have a .Net service that uses SENS to detect when a user logs on or off. Im having two problems, thoughp  ol liEven though the service seems to be starting automatically, if there is only one user on the computer and that user doesnt have a password meaning windows will start right away, the login doesnt seem to be getting detected. Is it possible that the service is getting started too late If so, what are my optionsli liI dont seem to have a way to detect windows switches users. In other words, if I log in with person A, I can detect that. If I then switch users meaning person A doesnt log out to person B, person B logs in and I detect that.

I seem to only be able to catch Display locksunlocks, logging onoff, when the screensaver startsstops, and when the shell starts. Is it possible to do more with SENS, or perhaps to detect when the user is switched using these operations Or perhaps by some other techniqueli ol

Negative 1469 pstrongUPDATE IIstrong OK, I managed to narrow it down a little.p  pI have a page with a datatable with sorting and filtering functionalities, both taking place in the DB.

The only sessionscoped beans contain the sorting and filtering of my interface.p  pFiltering for each column is bound to the certain session bean fields.

Negative 1469 pI am trying to swap two LinearLayouts by setting their visibility properties to VISIBLE and GONE respectively. I am also using an animation while the layouts are being swapped. The animation completes successfully and I see the correct layout. However, the previous Layout which has its visibility property set to GONE still receives clicks even though its not visible. At the same time, the layout which is VISIBLE receives clicks only when clicked in area where the GONE layout isnt clickable. I am also calling the requestFocus method on the VISIBLE layout. But it doesnt help.p  pMoreover, if I skip the animation part and just set the visibility properties, everything works correctly. p  pWhat am I missing herep

Negative 1469 pI have been working with jQuery recently and ran into a problem where I couldnt include it in a userscript because XmlHttpRequest uses the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSameoriginpolicysame origin policya. After further testing I found that most browsers also support the a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRaccesscontrolCrossOrigin Resource Sharinga access control defined by W3C as a workaround for issues with same origin policy. I tested this by hosting the jQuery script on a local web server that included the codeAccessControlAllowOrigin code http header, which allowed the script to be downloaded using XmlHttpRequest so that it could be included in my userscript. Id like to use a hosted version of jQuery when releasing the script, but so far testing with tools like a hrefhttpwww.seoconsultants.comtoolsheadershttpwww.seoconsultants.comtoolsheadersa I have not found any sites that allow crossorigin access to the jQuery script. Here is the list I have tested so farp  ul lia hrefhttpwww.asp.netajaxlibraryCDN.ashxhttpwww.asp.netajaxlibraryCDN.ashxali lia hrefhttpcode.google.comapisajaxlibsdocumentationindex.htmljqueryhttpcode.google.comapisajaxlibsdocumentationindex.htmljqueryali lia hrefhttpdocs.jquery.comDownloadingjQueryCDNHostedjQueryhttpdocs.jquery.comDownloadingjQueryCDNHostedjQueryali ul  pAre there any other hosted versions of jQuery that do allow cross origin access I know that jQuery is usually loaded via a script tag sometimes a dynamically created script tag, but in this specific case I have to use XmlHttpRequest and Eval to make sure it gets loaded into the correct scope. Google Chrome supports user scripts but does not support require, which means the only way to use a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2246901includejqueryinsidegreasemonkeyscriptundergooglechrome26260672626067jquery in a user script in Google Chromea is to embed it into the .user.js file or load and eval it via an XmlHttpRequest. Embedding is a less than optimal solution, and while Chrome Extensions allow you to include the jQuery js files in extensions I would prefer to stick with user scripts since they are much simpler and can work in more than just one browser. I have already submitted tickets with both the a hrefhttpcode.google.compgoogleajaxapisissuesdetailid427Google Ajax APIsa and a hrefhttpforum.jquery.comtopiccdnhostedjquerydoesnotallowcrossdomainoriginaccessjQuerya teams to allow cross domain access to the CDN, but my guess is that Ill just have to host it myself for now.p
Negative 1469 pAt first glance this may look like a duplicate of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions421275httpstackoverflow.comquestions421275a or a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions414336httpstackoverflow.comquestions414336a, but my actual question is a bit differentp  pAlright, this ones had me stumped for a few hours. My example here is ridiculously abstracted, so I doubt it will be possible to recreate locally, but it provides context for my question Also, Im running SQL Server 2005.p  pI have a stored procedure with basically two steps, constructing a temp table, populating it with very few rows, and then querying a very large table joining against that temp table. It has multiple parameters, but the most relevant is a codedatetimecode codeMinDatecode. Essentiallyp  precodecreate table smallTable ID int  insert into smallTable select a very small number of rows from some other table  select  from aGiantTable inner join smallTable on smallTable.ID  aGiantTable.ID inner join anotherTable on anotherTable.GiantID  aGiantTable.ID where aGiantTable.SomeDateField gt MinDate codepre  pIf I just execute this as a normal query, by declaring codeMinDatecode as a local variable and running that, it produces an optimal execution plan that executes very quickly first joins on smallTable and then only considers a very small subset of rows from aGiantTable while doing other operations. It seems to realize that smallTable is tiny, so it would be efficient to start with it. This is good.p  pHowever, if I make that a stored procedure with codeMinDatecode as a parameter, it produces a completely inefficient execution plan. I am recompiling it each time, so its not a bad cached plan...at least, I sure hope its notp  pBut heres where it gets weird. If I change the proc to the followingp  precodedeclare LocalMinDate datetime set LocalMinDate  MinDate where MinDate is still a parameter  create table smallTable ID int  insert into smallTable select a very small number of rows from some other table  select  from aGiantTable inner join smallTable on smallTable.ID  aGiantTable.ID inner join anotherTable on anotherTable.GiantID  aGiantTable.ID where aGiantTable.SomeDateField gt LocalMinDate codepre  pThen it gives me the efficient planp  hr  pSo my theory is this when executing as a plain query not as a stored procedure, it waits to construct the execution plan for the expensive query until the last minute, so the query optimizer knows that smallTable is small and uses that information to give the efficient plan.p  pBut when executing as a stored procedure, it creates the entire execution plan at once, thus it cant use this bit of information to optimize the plan.p  pBut why does using the locally declared variables change this Why does that delay the creation of the execution plan Is that actually whats happening If so, is there a way to force delayed compilation if that indeed is whats going on here even when not using local variables in this wayp  pMore generally, does anyone have sources on when the execution plan is created for each step of a stored procedure Googling hasnt provided any helpful information, but I dont think Im looking for the right thing. Or is my theory just completely unfoundedp  pstrongEditstrong Since posting, Ive learned of parameter sniffing, and I assume this is whats causing the execution plan to compile prematurely unless stored procedures indeed compile all at once, so my question remains  can you force the delay Or disable the sniffing entirelyp  pThe question is academic, since I can force a more efficient plan by replacing the codeselect  from aGiantTablecode withp  precodeselect  from select  from aGiantTable where ID in select ID from smallTable as aGiantTable codepre  pOr just sucking it up and masking the parameters, but still, this inconsistency has me pretty curious.p  hr  h2tldnrh2  pThis is an egregiously long question, so in briefp  pIs the full execution plan created when the stored procedure is first called, or as it executes That is, if a stored procedure consists of multiple steps, is the execution plan for each step created when the procedure is first called, or is it only created after past steps have finished executing again, the first time its calledp

Negative 1469 pI am trying to convert an ASF video with FFmpeg using an interface called mediahandler.p  pThe issue is, the metadata on the ASF video appears to be corrupt. It states that the video is 640x240, and 43 aspect ratio.p  pThe aspect ratio is correct, but obviously the resolution is not. This causes the converter to incorrectly scale the video, because it uses the resolution to determine the original aspect ratio.p  pI am able to get the aspect ratio metadata, but Im not sure this solves the issue, because I would think that if the resolution could be incorrect, then so could the aspect ratio metadata.p  pSo, is there any way to get the actual heightwidth It appears that players like VLC have no issue with this. How do I do such a thing w FFmpegp

Negative 1469 pits been some time now, since I started reading about android. Ive already made a few basic applications, but I still miss something How is actually sharing application component being done This is what the Android Dev Guide saysp  blockquote   pA central feature of Android is that one application can make use of elements of other applications provided those applications permit it. For example, if your application needs to display a scrolling list of images and another application has developed a suitable scroller and made it available to others, you can call upon that scroller to do the work, rather than develop your own. Your application doesnt incorporate the code of the other application or link to it.

Negative 1469 pIm transactionalizing some extensive database manipulation and I came across this issue where if I run sql queries through hibernate but not using the MQL approach, the view of the database doesnt appear correct.

Negative 1469 pYou can define a static constructor on an interface in .NET in IL.

Negative 1469 pIm interested in articles which have some concrete information about stateless and stateful design in programming. Im interested because I want to learn more about it, but I really cant find any good articles about it. Ive read dozens of articles on the web which vaguely discuss the subject, or theyre talking about web servers and sessions  which are also bout stateful vs stateless, but Im interested in stateless vs stateful design of attributes in coding. Example Ive heard that BLclasses are stateless by design, entity classes or atleast thats what I call them  like Personid, name, .. are stateful, etc.p  pI think its important to know, because I believe if I can understand it, I can write better code e.g. granularity in mind.p  pAnyways, really short, heres what I know bout stateful vs statelessp  pStateful like WinForms Stores the data for further use, but limits the scalability of an application, because its limited by CPU or memory limitsp  pStateless Like ASP.NET  although ASP tries to be stateful with ViewStates After actions are completed, the data gets transfered, and the instance gets handed back to the thread pool Amorphous.p  pAs you can see, its pretty vague and limited information and quite focussed on server interaction, so Id be really grateful if you could provide me with some more tasty bits of information p

Negative 1469 pI am considering the architecture for an enterprise logging service. Its job would be to receive and store log messages and then allow access to those log messages to users. Instead of building the logging functionality into our one existing Windows service that would use it for now, we need to separate it so that other services could use it in the near future. I like the fact that our various services could log their messages over net.tcp and then I could build a RESTful interface for delivering specific log messages to browsers or whatever.p  pCould anyone speak to the wisdom or lack of the following choicesp  ol liUse WCF for the logging serviceli liUse net.tcp for the transportli liHost the service in a Windows Service project using ServiceHostli ol  pAlso, how might I design it such that it takes advantage of some rather beefy servers that are going to be hosting it Is it possible to open up multiple connections or is that done automatically or implement some automatic multithreadingp  pThe one service we currently have that would be utilizing this logging service is quite verbose and would be sending log messages very frequently 40100kday. I have not yet built up a prototype and done any benchmarking and I know Im not giving you enough details to make a definitive decision, but Im just looking for some direction and considerations at this point.

Negative 1469 pIm trying to figure out how to construct a Django filter which includes terms which depend on userdefined functions UDF defined in MySQL.p  pMy UDFs handle a branch of computational chemistry called cheminformatics. One of the functions oematches lets me test if a substructure expressed as a SMARTS string matches a structure expressed as a SMILES string. You can think of these as isomorphic to regular expressions matching a string.p  pIn my database I have a table of topics called Nodes. This contains searchable text concerning a research topic. Some of the information in the topic concern molecules. I have a table of molecules. Molecules can be in more than one topic, and topics can be about more than one molecule, so I havep  precodeclass Nodemodels.Model     title  models.CharField     content  models.CharField  class Structuremodels.Model     smiles  models.CharFieldmaxlength255     nodes  models.ManyToManyFieldNode codepre  pNow I want to search for all nodes which have test in the title or content, emandem which match the SMARTS pattern [CH0] that is, carbons with at least one hydrogen.p  pIdeally I would like to write this like the followingp  precodeq  models.Qtitleicontainstest        models.Qcontenticontainstest      .filtermodels.Qstructurenodesmiles  oematchsmarts[CH0]      codepre  pwhere oematch is something which knows how to generate the right backend code for MySQL, in this case oematch[CH0], Structure.smiles and where Django sees the structurenodesmiles and does its manytomany magic to make the parts go together.p  pI see that I could get what I want with the raw interface as modulo minor syntax errors and using the wrong type of joinp  precodeSELECT  FROM Node, NodeStructure, Structure WHERE      Node.title LIKE test OR Node.content LIKE test AND       Node.id  NodeStructure.node AND        NodeStructure.structure  Structure.id AND       oematches[CH0], Structure.smiles codepre  pI would rather not mix and match my database layers that way. Plus, Ill have to do some code restructuring. Currently I create a filter, which I later pass to the model for the search.p  pLonger term, I want others to use my MySQL UDFs for cheminformatics, and I think some set of highlevel Django calls for my potential users other than the two others I work with, would be good, so even if I can solve the immediate problem with raw, I would still like to know a highlevel solution for the long term.p

I would rather the response from SomeMethod be more explicit and was considering refactoring it.  Throwing an exception from SomeMethod could offer a way to do this.  It would be in context and occur at the point of failure.p  pI am wondering if there is another way where SomeMethod could inform AnotherMethod that nothing was found in the database instead of assuming that null always equaled not found.  I thought that a NullObject could be used, but it is unclear to me how AnotherMethod should avoid continue working if the data was not found.p  pHow would you refactor the code p

After detecting the 4 corners in a proper order Im passing them into cvFindExtrinsicCameraParams2. Im getting nice results for the rotation and translation of the object respect to the camera frame. Now I have to put that information Rotation Vector and Translation Vector into OpenGL to draw something. Naturally, Im using cvRodrigues2 to get the rotation matrix from rotation vector.

Ive tried a code and I get that working drawing the axes but without the projection matrix... However, when I use glutPerspective obviously after glMatrixModeGLPROJECTION I just cant see anything... so, I dont know if someone out there has a working code in Qt with augmented reality without using ARToolkit because, as I said, Im getting the extrinsic camera parameters for my own... So, If anyone has a working code in which you get the extrinsic camera parameters and translate them into openGL projection and modelview matrices... hmm well, would be very helpful... this is because I found this examplep  precodehttpold.uvr.gist.ac.krwleewebtechReportsarCamera20Models.html codepre  pI followed all steps to achieve that conversion between the 2 camera models without success... Ill really appreciate if someone has a working code... thanksp

And this is where the problem is coming in, because the RFID listen method is run in a separate thread to the GUI thread, because it is an infinite while loop.p  pThe class that is used to take the picture takes an instance of a picturebox control as a parameter for its constructor, which is created in the main thread, and i think this is where the problem is.p  pEach part of the application works fine separately but when i try to call the method to take the photo from the listener thread all hell breaks loose and the app crashes.p  pDoes anybody know how I could call a method of the object that is initialized in the main thread that takes the photo from the listener threadp  pIve tried delegate and invoke, but cant figure it out as i dont want to manipulate the control directly, but rather let the object do it in the main thread.p  pHeres some codep  precode    private Capture cam     private int portIndex  1     private ArrayList AlreadyOpenPortList  new ArrayList     private byte readerAddr  0     private Thread listenThread     IntPtr mip  IntPtr.Zero      public podiumForm              InitializeComponent           scanner and camera startup         startCam         openComs         openRF         startListening         private void startListening              listenThread  new Threadnew ThreadStartthis.Listen         listenThread.Start            ltsummarygt      Method of retrieving code tag details from reader      ltsummarygt     private void Listen                      int fCmdRet  0x30         byte state  1         byte AFI  00         byte[] DSFIDAndUID  new byte[9]         byte cardNumber  0         string strDSFIDAndUID           byte outputSet          if GetCurrentUsePort                      MessageBox.ShowOpen ComPort, Please             return                    while true                      fCmdRet  StaticClassReaderA.Inventoryref readerAddr, ref state, ref AFI, DSFIDAndUID, ref cardNumber, portIndex             if fCmdRet  0                              outputSet  0                 fCmdRet  StaticClassReaderA.SetGeneralOutputref readerAddr, ref outputSet, portIndex                 strDSFIDAndUID  ByteArrayToHexStringDSFIDAndUID.Replace ,                  outputSet  3                 fCmdRet  StaticClassReaderA.SetGeneralOutputref readerAddr, ref outputSet, portIndex                 SavePicstrDSFIDAndUID.Substring2, 16                 MessageBox.ShowstrDSFIDAndUID.Substring2, 16                  ShutDown                             private void SavePicstring text              Cursor.Current  Cursors.WaitCursor           Release any previous buffer         if mip  IntPtr.Zero                      Marshal.FreeCoTaskMemmip             mip  IntPtr.Zero                    heres where it crashes          capture image         mip  cam.Click         Bitmap b  new Bitmapcam.Width, cam.Height, cam.Stride, PixelFormat.Format24bppRgb, mip         cam.Dispose           If the image is upsidedown         b.RotateFlipRotateFlipType.RotateNoneFlipY         pbPic.Image  b          Cursor.Current  Cursors.Default         MessageBox.ShowHere   text        private void startCam              const int VIDEODEVICE  0  zero based index of video capture device to use         const int VIDEOWIDTH  640  Depends on video device caps         const int VIDEOHEIGHT  480  Depends on video device caps         const int VIDEOBITSPERPIXEL  24  BitsPerPixel values determined by device          cam  new CaptureVIDEODEVICE, VIDEOWIDTH, VIDEOHEIGHT, VIDEOBITSPERPIXEL, pbPic         method in capture class  public IntPtr Click              int hr           get ready to wait for new image         mPictureReady.Reset         mipBuffer  Marshal.AllocCoTaskMemMath.Absmstride  mvideoHeight          try                      mWantOne  true               If we are using a still pin, ask for a picture             if mVidControl  null                               CRASHES HERE with  System.InvalidCastException was unhandled                  Tell the camera to send an image                 hr  mVidControl.SetModempinStill, VideoControlFlags.Trigger                 DsError.ThrowExceptionForHRhr                            Start waiting             if mPictureReady.WaitOne9000, false                              throw new ExceptionTimeout waiting to get picture                               catch                      Marshal.FreeCoTaskMemmipBuffer             mipBuffer  IntPtr.Zero             throw                    Got one         return mipBuffer      codepre

Negative 1469 pForgive me if this is a FAQ but Im a bit puzzled about how to get around this problem properly.p  pI recently downloaded the package a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgpackagetagsoup0.12.2 relnofollowTagSoupa which installed fine with the latest version em0.12.2emp  pThen I installed the package a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgpackagedownloadcurl0.1.3 relnofollowdownloadcurla which installed fine with the latest version. What I failed to realise was, downloadcurl depends on TagSoup with a version lt 0.11, so as part of the installation process Cabal downloaded an older version of TagSoup too.p  pThis is a problem because I want to use both libraries the latest version of TagSoup AND downloadcurl  and when you do for some reason GHCI gets in a bit of a mess.p  pMy question is, is there a way of specifying versions in your import statements, i.e.p  precodeimport Text.Html.TagSoup0.12.2 codepre  por is this a no go Im thinking not. p  pThe only way I got around this was to download the downloadcurl source, modify the code.cabalcode file to use TagSoup0.12.2 and reinstalled the package with my little hack in place which works as I would expect it to  but I dont think this is the solutionp  pAny help would be appreciatedp

Negative 1469 pIm fairly new to Wicket but Ive already run into a very strange problem.p  pIm creating a page with a pretty basic search form and a results table a DataView which is initially empty. When the user enters data into the fields and clicks Search, the app calls some backend services which are then used to populate the DataView.p  pHowever the user has to click Search twice for the data to be displayed.p  pI finally tracked this down, and its because Wicket is using zero for the number of items to be displayed for the first Search click. At the second click, the rows have already been added and Wicket has already calculated the proper number of rows to display, so it decides it will show the data.p  pIn AbstractPageableView.getItemModels, the size of the results to display is initially zero, because I dont load the table with any initial data probably.p  pI got around this problem by loading the DataView with empty rows on page load. This seems to trick the DataView into using the displaying the data for the first Search click.p  pMy question is am I doing this right Is there another repeater that is better for this task Is this a bug or somethingp

Negative 1469 pFirst let me tell you one thing, I have never worked with any sort of reporting yet. I have read all the related question and answer on this topic. But could not find any concrete solution. p  pMy problem is I have a very simple report to make where I have to show a row from a view from the database. In order to have that row, I have created a business object entity. that entity is holding my row perfectly. I have tried crystal report and rdlc report as well. But at the end I will choose only one. So I have a crystal report in my solution.

Negative 1469 pI use the following pattern in my app and am transitioning to ARC.

Negative 1469 pLets say I am implementing a calculator which adds two numbers.p  pSince we want to keep track of the partial result so far, we need to maintain two member variables, oldNum for the partial result, and newNum for the currently entered number.p  pNow at some point there will be an add method, which adds newNum to oldNum and stores the result in oldNum.p  pSince both newNum and oldNum are member fields, we dont need to pass or return anything in the add method.p  pOn the other hand, if you read the source code and you encounter a void method add without any parameters this might look strange.p  pSo my question is whether there are sometimes situations where you want to pass a member field to a member function.p  pIt would look something like p  precodeclass Calc      int oldNum, newNum     public void add1      oldNum  oldNum  newNum     public int add2int n1, int n2          return n1  n2   codepre

That way, I wouldnt have to do codeGROUP BYcode on the whole query, just have a repeating value in that one column.p  pThis question  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7658937howtowritethequantileaggregatefunctionHow to write the quantile aggregate functiona  asked something similar, but it got answered with a query rather than a stored function. p  pWhat I would like to know is what the syntax is for specifying that the stored function should operate on the whole column codecol1code and the current rows values of codecol2code and codecol3code.p  hr  pdjacobson all the examples for stored functions I see treat each parameter as a single, scalar value. Maybe the question I should be starting with is how to declare an aggregate stored function at all. So, lets say I just want a function that looks like this codemedBycol1code and that returns the median of the column specified in the argument. Once for each row. So if I do codeSELECT col1 myvalues, medBycol1 mymedian FROM foocode I will get a column of values codemyvaluescode and a column that is just the repeating median of the first column codemymediancode. p  pThanks.p

Negative 1469 pIve recently started developing Silverlight applications in Visual Studio and noticed that the XAML editor there is not optimal. Meaning, I can see the XAML in a text editor with pretty colors, but other than that it doesnt give me much productivity, like C code, with all the list of methods and parameters in a drop down list and other helpfule views and windows. Is there really not much support in VS2010 for easier editing of XAML filesp

Negative 1469 pI have separate repository classes for each entity.

Negative 1469 pIve been trying for days to get this working and I just cannot figure out why when I have my view to destroy a model which belongs to a collection which properly has a url attribute for the beginning fetch of models data, only fires the destroy event which is bubbled up to the collection for easy binding by my list view.  But it does not ever send an actual DELETE request or any request to the server at all.  Everywhere I look, I see everyone using either the collections url attr, or urlRoot if the model is not connected to a collection.  Ive even tested before the actual this.model.destroy to check the model lt console.logthis.model.url  p  pI have not overwritten the destroy nor sync methods for backbone.  Also each model does have an id attribute which is populated via the collections fetch from database records.p  pThe destroy takes place in the list item view, and the collections destroy event is bound in the list view.  All that works well the event handling, but the problem, again, is theres no request to the server.p  pI was hoping that backbone.js would do it automatically.  That was what the documentation implies, as well as the numerous examples everywhere.p  pMuch thanks to anyone who can give some useful input.p  pFYI  Im developing on wampserver PHP 5.3.4.p

Again, there is code that is referenced from elsewhere.  But please note  the collection does have a url attribute set.  And it does work for the initial fetch as well as when theres a change event fired for saving changes made to the models.  But the destroy event in the listitem view, while it does trigger the destroy event successfully, it doesnt send the DELETE HTTP request.p

Negative 1469 pOn Nvidia GPUs, when I call codeclEnqueueNDRangecode, the program waits for it to finish before continuing. More precisely, Im calling its equivalent C binding, codeCommandQueueenqueueNDRangecode, but this shouldnt make a difference. This only happens on Nvidia hardware 3 Tesla M2090s remotely on our office workstations with AMD GPUs, the call is nonblocking and returns immediately. I dont have local Nvidia hardware to test on  we used to, and I remember similar behavior then, too, but its a bit hazy.p  pThis makes spreading the work across multiple GPUs harder. Ive tried starting a new thread for each call to enqueueNDRange using codestdasynccodecodestdfinishcode in the new C11 spec, but that doesnt seem to work either  monitoring the GPU usage in nvidiasmi, I can see that the memory usage on GPU 0 goes up, then it does some work, then the memory on GPU 0 goes down and the memory on GPU 1 goes up, that one does some work, etc. My gcc version is 4.7.0.p  pHeres how Im starting the kernels, where increment is the desired global work size divided by the number of devices, rounded up to the nearest multiple of the desired local work sizep  precodestdvectorltclCommandQueuegt queues  Population of queues happens somewhere clNDrange offset, increment, local stdvectorltstdfutureltclintgtgt enqueueReturns int numDevices   queues.size   Calculation of increment local is gotten from the function parameters  Distribute the job among each of the devices in the context forint i  0 i lt numDevices i         Update the offset for the current device     offset  clNDRangeiincrement[0], iincrement[1], iincrement[2]      Start a new thread for each call to enqueueNDRangeKernel     enqueueReturns.pushbackstdasync                    stdlaunchasync,                    ampclCommandQueueenqueueNDRangeKernel,                    ampqueues[i],                    kernels[kernel],                    offset,                    increment,                    local,                    const stdvectorltclEventgtNULL,                    clEventNULL     Without those last two casts, the program wont even compile     Wait for all threads to join before returning forint i  0 i lt numDevices i         execError  enqueueReturns[i].get      ifexecError  CLSUCCESS         stdcerr ltlt Informative error omitted due to length ltlt stdendl     codepre  pThe kernels definitely should be running on the call to codestdasynccode, since I can create a little dummy function, set a breakpoint on it in GDB and have it step into it the moment codestdasynccode is called. However, if I make a wrapper function for enqueueNDRangeKernel, run it there, and put in a print statement after the run, I can see that it takes some time between prints.p  pP.S. The Nvidia dev zone is down due to hackers and such, so I havent been able to post the question there.p  pstrongEDITstrong Forgot to mention  The buffer that Im passing to the kernel as an argment and the one I mention, above, that seems to get passed between the GPUs is declared as using CLMEMCOPYHOSTPTR.

Negative 1469 pSo, I was wondering  how would I go about implementing strongcopyingstrong memory pages codestruct pagecode inside the kernel and utilizing the strongcopyonwritestrong mechanism instead of transferring the data immediately. p  pRight now, I copy pages by converting userland addresses to pages, allocating the needed amount of pages using codeallocatepagescode from the kernel, copying them using codecopypagescode and then finally mapping them into the desired region using codeinstallspecialmappingcode. This works but I feel like this could be optimized using the copyonwrite mechanism.p

Negative 1469 pI want to distribute tokens into 3 slots.p  pEach slot has some weight maybe 50 of tokens should go into the first slot, 30 should go into the second slot, 20 into the third slot. p  pI dont know the total number of tokens  they keep on coming. I may get 1000 tokens to distribute at noon, I get another 300 at 1 p.m. and so on, unpredictably. At any point in time, the tokens I have received so far should be distributed as well as possible according to the weights.p  pOne solution is to distribute by probabilities. I roll a 100sided die for each token. If the result is 150, the token goes in slot 1. A result of 5180 mean slot 2, a result of 81100 mean slot 3.p  pBut this means that its not impossible only improbable that every single token ends up in slot 3, for example.p  pI want to guarantee that when Ive received a total of 100 tokens, then exactly 50 of them will be in slot 1. When Ive received 1000 tokens, exactly 500 should be in slot 1.p  pWhat is a good algorithm for thisp

Negative 1469 pI want to learn and fill gaps in my knowledge with the help of this questionp  pSo, a user is running a thread kernellevel and it now calls yield a system call I presume The scheduler must now save the context of the current thread in the TCB which is stored in the kernel somewhere and choose another thread to run and loads its context and jump to its CSEIP.  To narrow things down I am working on Linux running on top of x86 architecture. Now, I want to get into the detailsp  pSo, first we have a system callp  p1 The wrapper function for yield will push the system call arguments onto the stack. Push the return address and raise an interrupt with the system call number pushed onto some register say EAX. p  p2 The interrupt changes the CPU mode from user to kernel and jumps to the interrupt vector table and from there to the actual system call in the kernel.p  p3 I guess the scheduler gets called now and now it must save the current state in the TCB. Here is my dilemma. Since, the scheduler will use the kernel stack and not the user stack for performing its operation which means the SS and SP have to be changed how does it store the state of the user without modifying any register in the process. I have read on forums that there are special hardware instructions for saving state but then how does the scheduler get access to them and who runs these instructions and whenp  p4 The scheduler now stores the state into the TCB and loads another TCBp  p5 When the scheduler runs the original thread, the control gets back to the wrapper function which clears the stack and the thread resumesp  pSide questions Does the scheduler run as a kernelonly thread i.e. a thread which can run only kernel code Is there a separate kernel stack for each kernelthread or each process p

Negative 1469 pI have a CodePen herep  pa hrefhttpcodepen.ioCWSpearpenBCriE relnofollowhttpcodepen.ioCWSpearpenBCriEap  pThe idea is the app has a sidebar, and you can click on Expand to make the content area full width. If you want to still bring up the sidebar, you can click on Flyout to make the sidebar reappear over the content i.e. maybe you only have the option to flyout in Portrait mode, a lot like the Mail app on the iPad.p  pI did an class toggle approach because it made the JavaScript very simple and everythings done with CSS Transitions.p  pThe thing is, even though the headertoolbar of the content area doesnt have a width, and thus should always be the full width of the content area, but when you click on expand, everything else works, except the width of the header doesnt change.p  pThis only happens in Webkit. It seems that it calculates what 100 is, and even though I change the padding of the content which, because of my boxsizing, makes the content wider, the header remains the same width. It seems to do the opposite on the way back. When I click expand which would normally probably say collapse now that I think about it again, it makes the header the full width, but as padding is added to the content, it doesnt readjust the width, and now the header is too wide for the content.p  pLet me illustratep  pBefore img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWBWO9.png altFrom here, you simple click Expandp  pClick on Expand and you get img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBSl3E.png altAw, its brokenp  pHeres what it is expected img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsSkDQ.png altYay, thats betterp  pIt works great in Firefox. It should also be noted that if you resize the window manually, it repaints the area and fixes the header thats how I actually got the expected screenshot. Triggering resize with JavaScript doesnt seem to be work since I dont think that triggers a repaint.p  pIve tried setting explicit 100 width and other JavaScript tricks and hacks trying to set a percentage width on the header with no luck.p  pHas anyone else ran into this or have a fixp  pIt was broken in Safari 6.0.1 and Chrome 22.0.1229.79, and worked in Firefox 15.0.1. Like a champ, that Firefox.p  pstrong[Update]strong It seems to only be related to padding, as ahren was able to fix it by switching to margin. And that works because contents width is auto. If it were 100 width, then it would break it.p  pDemo of that here a hrefhttpcodepen.ioCWSpearpenuvFJh relnofollowhttpcodepen.ioCWSpearpenuvFJhap  pMargin plays nice until I put codewidth 100code on the element, then it breaks out of the box, even in codeboxsizing borderboxcode.p  pFor some reason, the actual project Im working totally collapses the content when I set codewidth autocode, even though its definitely codedisplay blockcode. I am trying to reproduce that and post a CodePen for that.p  pIs this indeed a Webkit bug Are there any other alternativesp

Negative 1469 pIm debugging an application which uses ARC in Instrument at the moment.

However, until I have released the full version and had it approved, I dont know what will come after the itmsapps part of the URL, and so I cannot finish coding my trial version.p  pIs there any way to know a priori what my url will be I have very limited access to a Mac computer, and so if I can get the coding done now, I can just send the trial version for approval once I can confirm that the link will work.p  pI presume that at some stage in the app submission process I will specify something which will be converted into my apps URL. At present I havent submitted either version, as the full version is currently in beta.p  pAny wisdom would be greatly appreciated, as Id like to keep the time between publishing the full and trial versions to a minimum.p

Negative 1469 pOk I am switching from ant to maven on an android project and wondering if it the following would be easy to implementp  pCurrently I have a custom build.xml script which has several targets for creating release builds. Each of them is used to build the application to run against a different server URL, where the server can be a dev, production, staging, or even deployment servers we have in other countries.p  pThe reason is that our application will run against several different servers depending who gets it, and I dont want that to be something the user chooses. Instead it should be hardcoded into the application, which is how it works currently. p  pThis is fairly easy to setup in ant, I just take the values from the [env].properties file, and then replace out serverurl string in resvaluesconfig.xml. For instancep  precodeant releaseprod codepre  pWould pull read a file named prod.properties which defines what the serverurl was. I store the config.xml file in configconfig.xml as sop  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltresourcesgt     ltstring nameconfigserverurlgtCONFIG.SERVERURLltstringgt ltresourcesgt codepre  pThen my ant script does thisp  precodeltcopy fileconfigconfig.xml todirresvalues overwritetrue encodingutf8gt     ltfiltersetgt            ltfilter tokenCONFIG.SERVERURL valueconfig.serverurl gt     ltfiltersetgt ltcopygt codepre  pWhere config.serverurl was defined in prod.properties. p  pIm wondering how I could accomplish something similar with Maven Any ideas.

Negative 1469 pI asked this question on the developers forum too, but as my time is running out I hoped posting on stackoverflow might be quicker.p  pCurrently I am able to receive push notifications and I want to send some extra data along, after searching around I concluded that this should be possible. The idea is to set the messages from a users inbox in the app when a push notification is fired, so a users gets a push notification that says New message and along with it is the message send in a different key which is supposed to be saved in the codeApplications.Propertiescode when the push notifications codecallbackcode function is called.p  pHowever, the codecallbackcode function is never triggered. The notifications are send, the badge is set to what my php script does so is the message. To test if the callback was triggered I changed the badge and message to hardcoded values see below, I got this code from mainly from ios muncher but I assumed that the alert in the codecallbackcode would be the one shown to the user.p  pA different thing I noticed, I only receive push notifications when the user is not using the app, so when it is running in the background. When a user is using the app push notifications are not shown, I thought that this might be because the callback is not triggered.p  pThanks in advance for all kind help.p  pBelow some codep  precodeTitanium.Network.registerForPushNotifications       types [               Titanium.Network.NOTIFICATIONTYPEBADGE,               Titanium.Network.NOTIFICATIONTYPEALERT,             Titanium.Network.NOTIFICATIONTYPESOUND           ],           successfunctione             var deviceToken  e.deviceToken               Ti.API.infoPush notification device token is deviceToken                alertdevice token is e.deviceToken               var request  Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient              request.openPOST,httpsendToken.php               var params                     token e.deviceToken,                 username authProperties[0].username,                 userId authProperties[0].userId                                 request.sendparams              Ti.API.infoPush notification types         Titanium.Network.remoteNotificationTypes       Ti.API.infoPush notification enabledTitanium.Network.remoteNotificationsEnabled   ,   errorfunctione     alertError during registration e.error      Ti.API.infoError during registration e.error   , callbackfunctione           called when a push notification is received.

Negative 1469 pI have a HTML upload button to send multiple files to a server which responds with JSON.

The CustomerController is injected with a CustomerService instance. The CustomerService is then injected with a Repository instance, and the repository itself in injected with a UnitOfWork implementation which is created by the method BeginUnitOfWork in UnitOfWorkFactory class. Also worth mentioning is that the request is first intercepted by an authentication delegating handler for basic authentication. This handler also uses the CustomerService.p  pWhen making requests to the API, through a REST client or cURL or whatever this initially works, but every now and then or at some later subsequent request, I get an error down in the data layer when trying to access the ISession object being NULL, and I must restart the server to get it working again.p  pHave I missed something obvious Can anyone explain how to solve this Thanksp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI have been debugging this further and found out that my UnitOfWork is properly instantiated at every request and thus getting a new ISession. But in some cases the UoW Disposemethod is triggered twice due to some NHibernate cachingpruning according to the stack trace. Thats why the internal session object is null. Once this exception is triggered, in all subsequent requests, Ninject obviously finds an already existing instance of UnitOfWork, with this nullsession. p

The first transition opens the dialog box and fetches the values properly. After which I save the values in php session and reload the first page. After this process when I open the dialog box again the jquery is not able to fetch val and shows undefined. Im not sure if this is due to some reloading of the page issue or something else.

It is not clear to me how and if you can register Liferays builtin services if they arent already exposed.p  pAlso, the a hrefhttpdocs.liferay.comportal6.1javadocscomliferayportalserviceResourceLocalService.html relnofollowJavadocsa for ResourceLocalService specifically state p  blockquote   pstrongThis is a local service.strong Methods of this service will not have   security checks based on the propagated JAAS credentials because strongthis   service can only be accessed from within the same VM.strongp blockquote  pSo is it even possible to access methods of ResourceLocalService remotely with the JSONWS API  If so, can you point me in the right direction of how to do itp  pPS I am successfully using the JSONWS API in my external application for service methods that are already published and listed in codehttplocalhost8080apijsonwscodep

Negative 1469 pWe are looking for django blogging app that can be integrated into our existing project with more or less small integration effort. Our clients login to custommade management system that uses django users framework for authentication. They do not have access to the admin. We want our clients to have ability to manage their own blogs from our management system. So we are looking for django app that we can use to separately integrate the management system into ours.p  pSome of the common blogging apps are listed a hrefhttpswww.djangopackages.comgridsgblogs relnofollowhereap  pHowever, most of the apps we looked at use the admin for blog management. Does anyone have any experience porting the management system of any of these apps to a custommade managementp  pFor completeness here are some major criteria for the blogging we are looking forp  ul liShould be django app to be integrated into existing projectli liShould support Sites framework as we have more than 1 client that owns a separate domainli liRSSAtom, tags and search are basically a must.li liWell separated management module that is either using custommade views or if uses admin is considerably easy to integrate with nonadmin custommade management system. li ul  pIn particular from the above blog list Zinnia looks promissing but we dont yet know how easy it would be to move the management site to use custom made nonadmin views and templates.

Negative 1469 pI have read allot of questions on here about different ways to initialize a ActiveRecord model properly when dealing with initializing values and is always in relation to providing default values. A great a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions328525whatisthebestwaytosetdefaultvaluesinactiverecordanswera I came across helped clarify different ways.p  pHowever, if it is frowned upon to override the ActiveRecord base initialize method, what is the proper way to provide parameters to an ActiveRecord model when you want to initialize with values as you would in a standard Ruby class codeinitializearg1, arg2...code method.p  pso you can p  precodeobj  MyObject.newObj1, somenum codepre  pThe only thing I have come across was actually overrideing the codeinitializecode method but calling codesupercode first in the initialize.  However, this was frowned on because ActiveRecords base class uses codeallocatecode in allot of cases to instantiate an AR object and therefore could end up sidestepping the entire initialize method.p  pSo, maybe there is another fundamental reason why I am not finding providing initial values as a standard practice in RoRp  pI know I can use validates in the object to validate an object cant be saved without meeting requirements, such as having all the proper attributes set.  But I was approaching this particular object, so that it wouldnt be created without the required attributes when it is initialized to begin since at initialization we would have all that information and if retrieving from the DB we would have all those values.p  pCan someone help direct mep  pstrongextra questionstrong If there is an accepted way to do the above, there seems to be another area that needs to be considered when initializing objects with values and that is when the object is initialized from being retrieved from the DB.  Not handling the initializing values properly can possibly override what is retrieved from the DB or I have read when related to setting attributes to default values.  So if that needs to be handled properly, how do we do thatp

The arrays are only needed for the duration of the method that uses them, and there are a few different methods that needs scratch space like this.p  pAs I see it, there are a few different solutions for constructing the scratch arraysp  ol lipUse new to grab memory from the heap every time the method is called.  This is what I was doing at first, however it puts a lot of pressure on the garbage collector, and the fewms spikes once or twice a second are really annoying.pli lipHave the scratch arrays passed as parameters when calling the methods.  Problem is that this forces the user to manage them, including sizing them appropriately, which is a huge pain.  And it makes using more or less scratch memory difficult since it changes the API.pli lipUse stackalloc in an unsafe context to allocate the scratch memory from the program stack.  This would work just fine, except Id need to compile with unsafe and constantly sprinkle unsafe blocks throughout my code, which Id like to avoid.pli lipPreallocate private arrays once when the program starts up.  This is fine except I dont necessarily know the size of the arrays I need until I can look at some of the input data.  And it gets really messy since you cant limit the scope of these private variables to just a single method, so theyre constantly polluting the namespace.  And it scales poorly as the number of methods that need scratch memory increases, since Im allocating a lot of memory thats only used a fraction of the time.pli lipCreate some kind of central pool, and allocate scratch memory arrays from the pool.  The main problem with this is that I dont see an easy way to allocate dynamically sized arrays from a central pool.  I could use a starting offset and length and have all the scratch memory essentially share a single large array, but I have a lot of existing code that assumes double[]s.  And Id have to be careful to make such a pool thread safe.pli ol  p...p  pDoes anyone have any experience with a similar problem  Any advicelessons to offer from the experiencep

Negative 1469 pI am reading The Algorithm Design Manual and it says that the three operations on a basic List are emsearchingem, eminsertionem and emdeletionem. Then it goes on to describe an algorithm in C which, once it finds the node it is looking for by comparing the data of the nodes with that searched it returns that node and, thereby, any nodes connected underneath it. If it doesnt find what its looking for, it returns codeNULLcode.p  pSo my question is if we know what we are looking for why do we search for it And if the reason is just to see if it is included in the list, then why isnt a boolean function contains what we really wantp

Negative 1469 h2strongEDITstrong  I have solved my specific problem with jacksonhibernate using the library a hrefhttpsgithub.comFasterXMLjacksonmodulehibernate relnofollowhttpsgithub.comFasterXMLjacksonmodulehibernatea. The solution was not the one I searched for here, but it is equally valid in my situation.h2  pOriginal questionp  pI have recently come across the infamous codeorg.hibernate.LazyInitializationExceptioncode when using HibernateSpringJackson. The problem for me occurs when jackson tries to serialize and object, finds an attribute that is a lazyfetched value and tires to access it. I have read a lot of questions, posts and discussions about this but the proposed solution always seems to be a variant of two alternativesp  ul liMake sure that the lazy attributes are loaded before the transaction ends.li liConfigure jackson to ignore the attribute.li ul  pI wonder if there is another solution because the fact is that when my service returns a Hibernate object with some attributes not initialized, then I want to display the object in that manner. Configuring jackson for the specific purpose seems to be a strategy where the presentation layer needs intricate knowledge of the database layer and that seems like a bad solution.p  pThe way I would like it to work from my initial look at the frameworks is that whenever a Hibernate entity is accessed outside a transaction, hibernate should not care about the object and it should act like a normal POJO. In essencep  ol liStart a transactionli liPerform CRUD operations on Hibernate managed objects.li liEnd the transaction and possibly return fetchedmodified objects that can be used readaltered without events propagating to the underlying database.li ol  pExample of desired behaviourp  precodeStart transaction MyEntity entity  entityManager.findprimaryKey, MyEntity.class entity.getLazyLoadedFooList Load the list from database End transaction entity.getLazyLoadedBarList Return null instead of throw LazyInitializationException codepre  pThe basic idea is that the applications has a presentation, service and a DAO layer. The DAO layer is concerned with CRUD operations against the database. The Service layer wraps DAO methods in transactions and returns java objects that represent the data that was asked for. These objects are then available to to the presentation layer which converts them emas they areem to the desired format, in this case JSON.p  pTwo questions about thisp  ul liCan it be done like I describe or in some similar fashionli liIs it a goodbad ideali ul

Negative 1469 pI have been searching all morning how to do this. I have 2 codeView Controllerscode. From the root codeView Controllercode codeViewControllerAcode  which is a table view controller you can go push to the second view controller codeViewControllerBcode.p  pIn the codeViewControllerBcode, there are two fields contacts amp textBody. When the user is done they can click on Add. This will then go back to codeViewControllerAcode. What I am trying to do now, is for every time that process occurs, all the information from codeViewControllerBcode the user just added goes into a cell in codeViewControllerAcode. The user can then add as many cells as they like.p  pWhat I cant do however, is get the information across the view controllers. I have been looking all morning at using the app delegate, singletons, protocols, sharing properties, etc But I am still stuck. p  pWhat I want to do, but cant, is for every time the user clicks Add on codeViewControllerBcode, contacts amp texts are put into an array. This array is then put into another array which holds all the smaller arrays which the user has created If you have an ideas, or links to similarsample code or tutorials, that would be much appreciatedp

Thats likely a downside in practical terms, but itd still be an interesting thing to see.p  hr  pstrongUpdatestrong  Since its been pointed out that the Gray decode is only codelogncode operations using either of two different techniques, I spent some time trying to figure out if that is a strict limit on how far things can be simplified.  All bits must be considered when determining the next operation to perform, otherwise the considered bits would fail to change and the function would oscillate between two values.  The input must be compressed, in some way, to a manageable scale to determine the next operation to perform.p  pTo make it codelognkcode operations, a 2supksupentry LUT could be used to shortcut the last codekcode operations a comment suggests codek32code.p  pAnother technique which came to mind which can often reduce things very quickly is a combination of multiplication and bitmasks.  For example, to compute the a hrefhttpwwwgraphics.stanford.eduseanderbithacks.htmlParityMultiplyparitya in order to implement the paritybased algorithm.p  pFrom the multiplyandbitmask approach, it seems like there might be space to invent a Gray code which simplifies the set of operations even further... but I dont imagine any such code is known.p

Negative 1469 pFor a project I am working onSpringstruts 2hibernate, we decided to use h2 for unit testing with MySQL for the production store and manage the scheme in liquibase, pretty standard fare, but the issue we keep on running into is that h2 and MySQL differ in a lot of ways, for example how they handle timestamps and triggers.  Its getting to the point that I am starting to regret using h2 as the extra headaches the mismatches are causing are starting to outweigh its benefits.  My question is this, is there any other inmemorylocal file database that behaves more like MySQL  Obviously for integration testing we will still use MySQL, but being able to do unit testing without either making the liquibase files into a giant hack or having to ensure the local MySQL db is running would be nice.p

Negative 1469 pHow do compilers know when it is not necessary to recompile certain parts of code  especially in larger projectsp  hr  pFor example, lets say in C we have two C files and two header files. The header files depend on one another. They use the classes specified in each others files.p  pDoes a compiler always need to parse both header files, and maybe C files for method implementation, to obtain the class information in order to generate either of the two C filesp  hr  pI always thought that when you run the compiler at the command prompt, it closes immediately after outputting the object files  so it would be impossible to cache the Abstract Syntax Trees or intermediate code. Do most C compilers know when a certain file doesnt need to output to an object file, and is therefore skippedp

Negative 1469 pSay I we have following example of code. I have interface of DataFiller and 2 implementations of it.

The interface should be more like template, how to write more fillers. I thought about using generic type, but I am not sure if it is what I need.

Negative 1469 pemstrongNOTE Added After  I finally got numpydoc working.  It was also a python 2 problem. I ran 2to3 on it and now it seems to be working.emstrongp  pOK, Ive spent an entire day trying to get any Sphinx extension to work and am now hoping someone could point out what Im doing wrong. Sorry this is a bit long, but maybe more info will help you quickly find the error of my ways.p  pSphinx seems to be working as advertised, but I would like to use NumPy style documentation so thought Id install numpydoc.  In case it matters, Im using Python 3.3 winpython 64 bit on windows 7.  I started with the directions a hrefhttpcodeandchaos.wordpress.com20120809sphinxandnumpydoc relnofollowherea but got the errorp  precodeExtension error Could not import extension numpydoc exception cannot import name setup codepre  pGoogling that I found that some people got around it by using codenumpydoc.numpydoccode  No dice. I made sure everything possibly relevant was in my path as well as added into sys.path in sphinxs codeconf.pycode file.  I even tried copying numpydoc into sphinxs ext folder and changing the extension string accordingly, still no luck.p  pAt this point I gave up on numpdoc and decided to try napoleon.  Following the installation directions I just codepip install sphinxcontribnapoleoncode and then should be good to go. But alas, no, as napoleon seems to be in 2.x not 3 though the egg says codeSphinx1.1.3py3.3.egginfocode and during installation it says it is installing codesphinxcontribnapoleon0.2.1py3.3nspkg.pthcode.  Nonetheless, lots of python 2 code. I tried converting it with 2to3 but then I get a recursion too deep error.p  pSo, I decide to see if I am capable of installing any extension to sphinx.  I essentially at random pick findanything.  Install it as requested and it also fails, this time because of a relpath error codeValueError path is on mount C, start on mount Dcode.  Which I guess means that it is unhappy that my python installation is on C but my code Im trying to document and where Im trying to run sphinx is on D and that Im running Windows.p  pSo, did I just happen to pick 3 troubled extensions  Or, if not, what am I doing wrong and more importantly how can I do it right so that I get this workingp  pPS  Im completely new to Python so please dont assume that Im not making an incredibly stupid and basic error.p

Negative 1469 pI am currently working on something like an own cloud service but without using owncloud and I am also developing an app for it. Private files on my server are in a folder which is protected by a .htaccess file. So you cant access the files with a direct link.

My problem is that if I try to download a file like this in my iOs App with a progress bar and codeNSURLConnectioncode delegation methods, the result is, the App downloads the getfile.php file itself. I already tried some other ways. For example if I remove the codeSESSIONcode check in the codegetfile.phpcode, I just get an empty code.htmlcode file for download.

Negative 1469 pSo I am currently thinking about a small sideproject for me, where I thought about taking the Raspberry Pi Camera module, together with a RasPi NoIR camera module to take a timelapse of an area at specific times a day. This is my first RPi project, and the first time I use Python for anything else than messing about, keep this in mind when answering please.p  pThus far I have created a pseudocode with some actual codesyntax, and some just guessing. like for example DateTime.X, I do not know if I can use it like this, because of the lack of RTC, I have thought of adding an RTC chip to handle it. The area that the unit should stand in does not have any form of internet, but I can get power there fairly easily.p  pHere is my pseudocode, please tell me if you see something wrong, or something that I should change, thus far this is only the pseudocode for the RPi Camera module, not the NoIR.p  precode    Loop  import datetime import os if DateTime.Hour  0,5,10,15,20  true and os.path.existscurrent.jpg  false     raspistill o current.jpg  if DateTime.hour 1,6,11,16,21  true and os.path.existscurrent.jpg  true     os.rename current.jpg, DateTime.Year.DateTime.Month.DateTime.DayDateTime.Hour1      Goto loop codepre  pThe idea behind it is that it will get the hour of the day, then check it against the numbers So if the hour is O midnight, it will give an OK, then check if there is already a file called current.jpg. If there is no image named that, it will go on. The following statement just makes the camera module take a picture named current.jpg.p  pIf an image named current.jpg already exist, then it will go to the next line, which will at one hour later rename the image to the date and time the image was taken. So if the image was taken the 1st of january, 2013, at 0 in the morning, the code will run one hour later, and rename the image 2013.01.10.jpg.p  pI am unsure of whether or not I could use the date and time when taking the image, or just declare a variable. Some info here would be nice.p  pThanks for all of the help, and for reading through my rambling.p

I set up a IAM role like sop  precode   Version 20121017,   Statement [             Action [        s3Get,        s3List       ],       Effect Allow,       Resource arnawss3mybucketname        ]  codepre  pI called the role s3bindownloadrolep  pI start my EC2 instances using the following commandp  precodeec2runinstances ami4b143122 n 1 k useastkeypair p s3bindownloadrole g sg t t1.micro z useast1a  codepre  pThis seems to work cleanly. But i havent figured out how to verify that this EC2 instance actually has this role in it.p  pAnyway, once the instance starts up, i SSH into the machine and type p  precodecurl httpmybucketname.s3.amazonaws.commyfile.html codepre  pThis gives me a Access Denied error.p  pIve setup my S3 bucket with NO permissions specified. This is obviously incorrect it seems. But im not sure what the minimal list of permissions is that i need to specify on the bucket to allow programs on this EC2 instance to read it.p  pAs a bonus, id be very grateful if someone could tell me how i can figure out if an EC2 instance has a particular IAM role applied to it. The AWS console doesnt seem to have this information.p  pEDIT p  pslayedbylucifer is right but the details were very confusing so im adding the details here.p  pWhats confusing is that you can in fact create IAM roles and immediately start up EC2 instances with those roles without creating any users or groups. Just use ec2runinstances from the cli tools with the p flag to pass in the name of the role you just created  the instance will start up with the role which you can verify by issuing the following commandp  precodecurl http169.254.169.254latestmetadataiamsecuritycredentialsltrolenamegt codepre  pIf this works, then this instance will now run all requests that use the aws tools with permissions granted to it by that role.p  pBUT, whats happened behind the scenes is that since there are no users or groups defined, the user is implicitly the root user or whomever you are logged in as to the management console when you created the role. So, its not that creating but not assigning the role means no one has access  ec2 instances started by the creator have access if the role gives access.p  pSo now all you have to do is go to the S3 management console and give your bucket permissions for just yourself. And thats it.p  pAlso, you can in fact use curl to retrieve the S3 objects even if they are not public however, since its not a aws tool, you need to explicitly pass in the hmaced aws tokens with the request which a tool like s3curl.pl will do for you.p

Negative 1469 pIs it safe to assume that in order for Composition Root only Dependency Injection to occur, the assembly containing the composition root usually the entry assembly must contain project references to all projects of a given application  Please note that in this case Im assuming that latebound type resolution will not be used i.e. XML configuration with unity or the attributed model in MEF.p  pIve been told by multiple sources, including Mark Seemann, that a hrefhttpblog.ploeh.dk20100203ServiceLocatorisanAntiPattern relnofollowusing a DI container as a service locator is an antipatterna and it is in violation of the spirit of Martin Fowlers definitions of the a hrefhttpmartinfowler.comarticlesinjection.html relnofollowDependency Injection Pattern.ap  pConsider the following sample Layer Diagram below. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJ3oQB.png altLayer diagram for a hypothetical application. The emClientsem represent a set of head projects for Windows Desktop, Windows Store, and Windows Phone 8. in this case lets assume that they are all C projects using a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms75413028vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowWPFa, a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsappsHh700354.aspx relnofollowJupitera, and the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsphonedevelopcc18903628vvs.10529.aspx relnofollowWindows Phone Silverlight Implementationa respectively for UI design.  In each case they are relying on a few .NET portable subsets in the emApplicationem layer.  Each component of the emApplicationem layer is independent of one another, and all are dependent on the emCoreem layer or the domain layer.  This same emCoreem layer is also depended upon by the clients themselves.p  pIf we assume that each application in the clients layer implements its own composition root, and that the composition root is implemented using a similar method in each system, then using xml.config files is inappropriate for instance, windows store and windows phone 8 do not use external config files like .NET applications do with app.config.  Therefore the next best option is to use Code as Configuration.  Using Code as Configuration however requires access to concrete types and therefore reference dependencies available to the composition root must be of the complete set of dependencies.  p  pAm I missing something Is there a better way to uncouple the dependencies here or is this a desirable trait for the application host assemblyp

However, I ran across some strange behavior with table cells that I could not find an answer to.p  pIn my implementation, my application can create a multipage PDF containing a large table on each page.  Each table has the same design and contains similar data, and thus, has identical table headings.p  pTo speed things up and stay DRY, I would create a header row with p  pre classlangrb prettyprintoverridecodeheader  [] 0..6.each do index     header ltlt pdf.makecellcontent gt Heading index, width gt 140, borders gt []] end codepre  pThen, with multiple calls to codepdf.tablecode, I could reuse that header row for each table on which I wanted the header row to appearp  pre classlangrb prettyprintoverridecode4.times do i     pdf.table[header]  morerows      the morerows variable is an array containing additional rows to be shows beneath the header end codepre  pWith the loop above, I would expect to have four tables, each having the same top row.  This is true, however, the table dimensions are goofed.  Namely, the column widths are ignored in subsequent tables and the table width is not respected.  The first table is perfect, but the second and beyond succumb to this problem.p  pThe only way I was able to solve this was to create the header row each time I created a table, which means lots of code duplication.  It works great, but isnt DRY at all.p  pSo, in the example above, why would reusing codeheadercode cause varying column and table widths  Is there a more proper way to reuse a codePrawnTableCellcode objectp

Negative 1469 pI have a rather huge project that has lot of generic C classes, some C classes with reference to MFC. The UI is all written is MFC. Application uses ATL  COM to expose objects to scripting languages such as VBA and Python. There are thousands of scripts written in VBA and python. p  pMy next project is to make this application work on many different platforms. However when run on Windows I expect that already existing VBA scripts run.  Any suggestions on what is the best way to approach at this is greatly appreciated. Please suggest programing languages or tools that could be used.If I can make use of existing c code base better but not necessary. Scriptable objects need to maintain the same interface as before and they should run with no Or very minimal changes to them. Also is there a easy way to move the scripts written in python 2.7 to python 3.x p

Negative 1469 pI have undergone a situation  where i have to implement a queue type data structure.It is like thisp  p1 Suppose there is an array data[50] 1,2,3,4,5,6p  p2 int Front must point to first index and int rear must point must point to last index.p  p3Now i have to add first and second element of this array. Suppose i do that i23 and this 3 will be set at last by doing rear1 data[rear1], Now when the second execution occurs, We dont have to take into account the first two element they already added, So in this case we can do data[front2]. strongBut pay attention here please, because this 2 is going to be done first time onlystrong , after this it will be just 1 because we added only one element, and first time we add 2 element.And the element obtained on addition must go to last of the index like 3 obtained will go at last like this 1,2,3,4,5,6,3.p  p4So we have to take into account p  p4.a Increment of Rear by one on each addition.p  p4.b Increment of Front by one accept the first addition where we add two elements.p  p5 My idea to do this is as followsp  precode    include ltstdio.hgt     define MAX 50     int data[MAX]     int rear   1     int front   1      void main           int rear6, front0      data[size]1,2,3,4,5,6      int countsize      First do addition of the first two elements      data[rear] data[0]data[1]      forifront iltsize21  i we are doing data21 because we know the final obtained on doing all the addition until there is 1 element will have the size size21.               do                    here we do addition data[rear1]data[front]data[rear]           rear               count         while countgt1               fori0 iltsize21  i               printfd , data[i] Now this must print 1,2,3,4,5,6,3,6,9,12,21 addition of element at front and rear                       codepre  pMy doubt is how to increase the Front by two first time addition and by increasing by one after first addition so that first will always point to the element to be addedincreasing is not difficult , i have done that.

Negative 1469 pI have a lighweight setup where I am using Web API 2 with OData but do not create an odata endpoint with its accompanying odatametadata but instead just use standard ApiControllers with attribute routing and Get methods marked with an override of [Queryable] [InlineCountQueryable] detailed here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15790695webapiodatainlinecountandtestingWeb API, OData, inlinecount and testinga.p  pIt all works very well except that I can only expose dedicated model classes without any collections or object properties because the JSON serializer serializes the whole object graph.

Negative 1469 pIve been working on an HTML5 application that draws fractal images defined by iterating functions, such as the famous Mandelbrot fractal. a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMandelbrotset relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiMandelbrotsetap  pMy understanding is that Javascript uses only a single data type for numbers, doubleprecision floating point.  Due to this limitation, I cannot make my program draw as precisely as I would like to be able to.  There are images and videos on the internet that represent fractal images so precise that they use hundreds of digits after the decimal point.  See here for an example a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvfoxD6ZQlnlU relnofollowhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvfoxD6ZQlnlUap  pI have heard of highprecision calculation libraries for Javascript, but the ones I have seen all use strings to represent numbers, which is incompatible with asm.js.p  pIs there a practical way to do highprecision calculations with asm.js  How high  I would say arbitrarily high.  The precision needs to be adjustable.p  pIf I had to take a shot in the dark, I would guess that since asm.js does support integer arithmetic, I could somehow make it work by using arrays of integers to represent a large number of digits after the decimal point.  I could represent the digits as strings and have a small function to divide them up into arrays to be passed to asm.js code.p

Negative 1469 pNeed some opinions on the best way to manage templating in Underscore. Im building a Backbone app and using Underscore to manage the templates. I started off by doing something like this in a template.js file.p  precodetemplates       template1 lth1gtSome HTMLlth1gt,     template2 lth1gtSome more HTML and a lt variable gtlth1gt     ...  codepre  pThis gets messy. Fast. So, I looked into RequireJSs a hrefhttpsgithub.comrequirejstext relnofollowtext plugina and that makes it much cleaner. Now, I have a bunch of HTML files, and I essentially store it into my templates object. Something like thisp  precodedefine[texttemplatestemplate1.html,     texttemplatestemplate2.html,     ...],      functiontemplate1, template2, ...          return              template1 template1,             template2 template2,             ....           codepre  pSo now the issue is HTTP requests. For templates alone, I have 5 requests  1 for the template.js file, and then 4 separate HTML template files. And that list is going to keep growing. One thing I was thinking was to put all of the HTML in one file, but that doesnt seem to go with the AMD methodology. As the app progresses, I can be a lot smarter about this and only load HTML templates when necessary  if theyre all separate.p  pIs there any way around all of the HTML requests I assume this is not good practice in a production environment.p  pAnyone have any other ideas for how to accomplish what Im trying to dop
Negative 1469 pFor this specific project, my team and I are thinking of leveraging the power of AngularJS directives and use them to build custom elements specific to our project, and use them like they were real HTML components.p  pFor instance...p  pSay we have this table where each row is composed with a bunch of information that we get from a request, each row will be repeated with codengrepeatcode. Inside each row we will have multiple custom buttons with the same custom behavior. This button will also be used across different modulespages on the website and not only on this specific table.p  pOur first thought was to use 2 directives, one for the table row and one for the button. The idea is that these are custom componentselements with custom attributes to define the custom behavior of the element. This would allow us to have a really nice modular application where each component is developed and unittested individually. Our HTML would also be easy to ready and understand.p  pDoes this sound goodp  pNow, what about performance issues Could we encounter big issues with this approach if, say we have a table with 100 of those rows and 5 of those buttons per row. Could this be big a problem if those rowsbuttons had a couple of bindings to update information each X secondsp

Through the SwingWorker constructor, I pass these variables about 6 variables more or less, and use them to do the processing and fill the tables.p  pI thought I would be able to update the value of these variables in the overriden Done method poor me again, and not just the GUI components.p  pI learned many things with this failure 1 even though I passed the variables through the constructor, that doesnt mean they get updated in the place they come from. 2 SwingWorker can only return 1 variable, and modify GUI components.p  pSo, and this is my main point, how can I do what I was trying to do I learned it cant be done with SwingWorker class but then, how can it be donep  pI dont want to put the code in an mouse click event just like that, because it would block my EDT with no

Negative 1469 pI want to synchronise my SQL database using Hibernate and show the entries in JTable. In order to allow for editing the data in JTable, it is necessary to monitor changes made in JTable and update the database using Hibernate.p  pThere are few examples how to achieve this by using a CustomTableModel.

Negative 1469 pIm writing a Linux kernel module to read out a GPS device a a hrefhttpwww.ublox.comdegpsmodulespvtmodulesneo7.html relnofollowublox NEO7a via USB by using the book a hrefhttpwww.makelinux.netldd3 relnofollowLinux Device Driversa.p  pI already can probe and read out data from the device successfully. But, there is a problem when reading the device with multiple applications simultaneously I used cat devublox to read indefinitely. When the activereading applications is cancelled via Ctrl  C, the next reading attempt from the other application fails exactly method call strongusbsubmiturb...strong returns strongEINVALstrong.p  pI use following ideas for my implementationp  ul liThe kernel module methods should be reentrant. Therefore, I use a mutex to protect critical sections. E.g. allowing only one reader simultaneously.li liTo safe ressources, I reuse the a hrefhttpswww.kernel.orgdochtmldocsusbAPIstructurb.html relnofollowstruct urba for different reading requests see an a hrefhttpwww.makelinux.netldd3chp13sect3 relnofollowexplanationali liDevicespecific data like USB endpoint address and so on is held in a strongdevicespecific structstrong called strongubloxdevicestrong.li liAfter submitting the USB read request, the calling process is sent to sleep until the asynchronous complete handler is called.li ul  pI verified that the ideas are implemented correctly I have run two instances of cat devublox simultaneously and I got the correct output only one instance accessed the critical read section at a time. And also reusing the struct urb is working. Both instances read out data alternatively.p  pThe problem only occurs if the currently active instance is cancelled via Ctrl  C. I can solve the problem by not reusing the struct urb but I would like to avoid that. I.e. by allocating a new struct urb for each read request via a hrefhttpswww.kernel.orgdochtmldocsusbAPIusballocurb.html relnofollowusballocurb...a usually it is allocated once when probing the USB device.p  pMy code follows the a hrefhttpsgit.kernel.orgcgitlinuxkernelgittorvaldslinux.gittreedriversusbusbskeleton.cidrefstagsv3.16rc7 relnofollowUSB skeleton drivera from Greg KroahHartman who also reuse the struct urb for different reading requests.p  pMaybe someone has a clue whats going wrong here.p  pThe complete code can be found on a hrefhttppastebin.comUUxsrtAk relnofollowpastebina.

Negative 1469 pI waw wondering what could be some of the common pitfalls that a novice go programmer could fall in when writing unintentionally slow go code.p  p1 First, I know that in python doing string concatenation can be or used to be expensive, is that the same in go when trying to add one element to a string As in helloWorld.p  p2 The other issue is that I find myself very often having to extend my slice with a list of more bytes rather than 1 byte at a time. I have a dirty way of appending it by doing the followingp  pcodenewStr  stringarrayOfBytes  stringnewBytesToAppendcodep  pIs that way slower than just doing something likep  precodefor , b  range newBytesToAppend     arrayOfBytes  appendarrayOfBytes, b  codepre  pOr is there a better way to append whole slices to other slices or maybe a built in way It just seems to me a little odd that I would even have to write my own extend function or even benchmark itp  pAlso, sometimes I end up having to loop through every element of the byte slice and for readability, I change the type of that current byte to a string. As inp  precodefor , b  range newBytesToAppend     c  stringb     some more logic on c     logicc logic  codepre  p3 I was wondering, if strongconverting typesstrong in go is expensive specially between string to arrays and if that might be one of the factors that might be making the code slow. Btw, sometimes I change types to strings strongverystrong often, nearly every iteration.p  pBut more generally, I was trying to search for the web a list of hints of what often are things that makes go code slow and was trying to change it so that it wouldnt but didnt have that much luck. I am very much aware that this depends from application to application, but was wondering if there are any expert advice on what usually makes novice go code slow.p  p4 The last thing I can think of is, that sometimes I do know in advance the length of the slice, so I could just use arrays with fixed length. Could that change anything p  p5 I have also made my own types as inp  precodetype Num int codepre  por p  precodetype Name string codepre  pDo those hinder performancep  p6 Is there a general list of heuristic to watch out in go for code optimization For example, is dereferencing a problem as it can be in Cp

Negative 1469 pAlong the lines of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3327669rubypaperclips3anddeepcloningthis questiona, Im using a hrefhttpsgithub.commoiristodeepcloneable relnofollowdeepcloneablea to copy a model with its single association. That association has an attached image stored in s3, which I want copied at the time of the clone.p  pThis is how Im doing the deepclone now  this clones the codegallerycode along with its associated codephotoscode, and updates the copied codegallerycode to have a new codelocationidcode based on some passed parametersp  precodenewgallery  gallery.deepcloneincude photos do original, copiedgallery   copiedgallery.locationid  galleryparams[Locationid] end  newgallery.save codepre  pMy first thought was to somehow iterate over either the codeoriginalcode or codecopiedgallerycode photos, to assign codephoto.image  oldphoto.imagecode within the overall codedeepclonecode block, but I dont know if all of the necessary data is accessiblefindable at that point.p  pFrom there, I wonder if theres access to the codeinclude photoscode portion of the codedeepclonecode block. Similar to how I have access to both codeoriginalcode and codecopiedgallerycode, if I could access the original amp copied photos within the block, then I could easily assign values. I just dont know if that level of access exists.p  pIf all else fails, I might be better off dropping the codeinclude photoscode portion of the codedeepclonecode block. I could clone the gallery on its own, then clone the individual photos just after that  something like thisp  precodenewgallery  gallery.deepclone do original, copiedgallery   copiedgallery.locationid  galleryparams[Locationid] end  newgallery.save  gallery.photos.each do photo   newphoto  photo.deepclone do original, copiedphoto     copiedphoto.image  original.image   end    newphoto.save end codepre  pThat feels very heavyhanded, though.p  pDo you have any insight into the codeinclude photoscode portion of the codedeepclonecode block, or do you have any other ideas on how to set the codeimagecode for each of the codephotoscode being clonedp

Negative 1469 pI am developing a client in codeJavacode. It communicates with the server via actions. Actions are sociallike actions an example of a action is a user views the profile of another user. p  pWith the View Profile example above, the client executes 4 queries to get the data from the database server. To provide consistency, I want to put the 4 queries in a transaction. So in my View Profile function, first I put codeconn.setAutoCommitfalsecode, then queries the data, and at the end before return I set auto commit to true again codeconn.setAutoCommittruecode see the code snippet below.p  precodetry     set auto commit to false to manually handle transaction   conn.setAutoCommitfalse     execute query 1     ...     execute query 2    ...     execute query 3    ...     execute query 4    ...     set auto commit to true again to not affect other actions   conn.setAutoCommittrue  catch SQLException e    e.printStackTraceSystem.out  finally    try      conn.close    catch SQLException e      e.printStackTraceSystem.out     codepre  pHowever, when I run the code, sometimes I notice that the data returned from this action is not consistent. When I tries to combine the 4 queries in a single query, I can achieve consistency.p  pMy question is, does setting autoCommit in Java really work with read transaction like in my example, when I want to issue separate queries to the DBMS If not, how can I provide consistency if I want to query the DBMS in 4 separate queriesp  pFYI, the database server I use is Oracle DB.p

Negative 1469 pOne of the screens in my app completely broke when updating to the iOS 8 SDK.

There are two constraints on the top layout guide, one for the upper image view, and one for the white view below it.

Negative 1469 pI have a Rails 3.2.19 app that Id like to track vehicles Units with using geocoding and plotting on Google Maps.p  pI came up with a way to get coordinates by using the codetaipparsercode gem and creating a rake task that constantly listens for inbound taip data, parses the latitude and longitude and updates the vehicle models codelatitudecode and codelongitudecode fields.  From there I was able to plot vehicle locations using the codegmaps4railscode gem.  The limitation of this is that you have to use a specific 3G4G modem that speaks in TAIP to send the latlong to the Rails server so the rake task can parse it.p  pWhat Id like to do is to negate having to use these expensive 3G4G modems and instead pull the coordinates from a mobile device located in the vehicle currently an iPad.p  pSo my thoughts are to use the HTML5 Geolocation feature in the browser to obtain the latitude and longitude of the unit and somehow store that into the Units latitudelongitude database fields upon pagepartial refresh which happens currently via Ajax.p  pThis would break the dependence on the the existing devices and allow any mobile GPS enabled device to be compatible with this feature.p  pCurrently in my app I have codegmaps4railscode to plot the units using my rake task and taip data parsing and also codegeocodercode which Im testing to geocode addresses as they are created for another purpose.p  pMy questions arep  pCan someone provide an example of how to use the HTML5 geolocation feature in a rails view  Once HTML5 geolocation is enabled in the view, how to get the latitude and longitude into the respective models latitude and longitude fields  Perhaps an example iteration of multiple objects latitude longitude using gmaps4railsp  pIf my question is too vague or convoluted please let me know so I can edit it and make things more clear as to what Im trying to do.p
Negative 1469 pI am newer to Java and still sometimes get lost with OOP. I am creating a Swing GUI that takes a source file C, C, Java and converts it to XML. My button codeRunSourceCodecode first converts the source to XML then calls a class named codeUnitXMLReadercode that analyses the XML created. p  pWhat Im finding is that each use of the button remembers attributes from the previous. At first I was creating the instance of codeUnitXMLReadercode globally but I thought that if I have each use of the button create a new instance it shouldnt remember attributes from the previous. For example the codegetDepcode method returns the correct result on the first use but if I then try a second file requiring a second press of the button it returns the combination of both files tried. From what Ive read it isnt recommended to manually delete instances but my limited OOP experience tells me that it may solve this issue is there a safe way to do it to prevent instabilityp  pEDIT codegetDepcode is just a simple get method I added to the class codeUnitXMLReadercode.

See the commented out code above.  This worked, but created another issue where the codeonActivityCreatedcode started again and launched my AsyncTask when I didnt want it to.  I cant send or check variables in the codesavedInstanceStatecode bundle to the fragment, as it is null due to the codesetRetainInstancetruecode.

Negative 1469 pI have an application that uses Castle Windsor to create the Controllers and all descendant objects.  The Castle Root has about 1200 total objects in it and can take a bit of time to create the controller and descendant objects, typically this is not an issue as it is only about 2530 of time based on running visual studio Performance Monitoring.p  pIn the application I have a type ahead autocomplete control where the user starts typing and a possible list of choices is returned.  This method takes between 11.5 seconds.  Which is a bit annoying for a type ahead.  I want it under 12 sec.  the time spent in the actually controller method is around .1.2 seconds.p  pSo what Im looking for is a way to speed this method up.  If I could create a controller that was not part of Castle Windsor that would remove 30 of time bringing the time it takes down to .6.9 seconds, which would be much better.p  pSo is there a way to have a Controller that is not created through Castle, but normal ASP.NET Controller creation, or is there a different better way to speed this method up.p

If I type in 1234 in the text box, the text box will always show the full number I type in.p  pBut, the results part will show numbers starting with 1234 for a split second, then it will loose the 4, then it will loose the 3, then it will loose the 2, and then it shows partnos starting with 1 and that will stay. Most of the time it is so fast it looks like it just drops all numbers at once, but I watch real close and its droping one char at a time.p  poutput to screen  for testingbr js var partno shows 1234br js var idxno shows  1234br php var idxno shows 1  p  pthis number 1234 is only an example, I use random partnos from 3 to 20 chars and when it drops chars it always leaves the first char enterd.p  pIf I use the backspace key to remove the 4 then the 23 will come back and I can enter 4 again and the php var idxno will show 1234 like it should.br If I restart the server it will always happen the first time I enter a part number, sometimes the second and third time, then it may work fine for 10 to 20 more lookups and then will do it again, it is never really consistent.br If I run this query on an empty database it works fine, Never drops the numbers.br If I remove the ORDER BY clause it will almost always drop all chars except the first one. I have this basic code running now on my first draft of this program with all manufactures in separate databases and it works great. I am trying to combine all manufactures into one database file and this when the problem started.br With separate manufactures the largest price list is probably around 150,000 rows.br With all manufactures combined it is around 750,000 rows now, and will be a little over 1,000,000 rows when done.p  pI am runningbr Debian Wheezy 7.2br Apache version 2.2.22br MySQL version 5.5.38br PHP Version 5.4.414deb7u14  p  pI am using a Virtualbox server to write and test code, But I put this on a real server on the lan and it does exactly the same.p  pI hope I gave enough info for this problem, This is my first attempt at a real program as such, and I cannot figure a way to troubleshoot what is happening, I have been at this for months and for the first time, finally decided to ask for help.  p  pThanks for any help I can get.p  pindex.php  p  precodeltdoctype htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt     ltmeta charsetutf8gt     ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefstyles.cssgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcjsphpjquery1.11.1.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt var npage  0 function partlookupcnt     var action  lookup     var partno  document.getElementByIdpartno.value     var idxno  partno.replace[azAZ09]g,         if cnt  next npage  npage  15         else if cnt  prev npage  npage  15         else npage  0             if npage lt 0 npage  0         .postjsphppartlookup.php, actionaction, idxnoidxno, npagenpage,          functiondatapartdata.htmldata      ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltphp     whereamihome    includepagesetup.php gt ltbodygt      ltcode will not validate w3c with this body tag, says tag already open gt ltdiv idlookupgt     ltdivgt         ltinput idPrev typebutton valuePrevious Page onclickpartlookupprevgt         ampnbsp ampnbsp ampnbsp ampnbsp ampnbsp ampnbsp         ltinput idpartno typetext namepartno maxlength20 autocompleteoff autofocus onclickthis.value   onkeyuppartlookupgt         ampnbsp ampnbsp ampnbsp ampnbsp ampnbsp ampnbsp         ltinput idNext typebutton value   Next Page    onclickpartlookupnextgt      ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv idpartdatagtltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  ppartlookup.php  p  precodeltphp inisetdisplayerrors, On errorreportingEALL  ESTRICT  includedbconnect.vars.php  Make a MySQLi Connection dbconnect  mysqliconnectdbhost, dbuser, dbpass, dbname if dbconnect dieConnect Error .mysqliconnecterrno. .mysqliconnecterror  idxno  POST[idxno] page  POST[npage] echo idxno  .ltbgt.idxno.ltbgtltbrgt result  mysqliquerydbconnect,    SELECT PriceList., Inventory.instk AS instk, Inventory.ovrstk AS ovrstk, Inventory.used AS used    FROM PriceList    LEFT JOIN Inventory ON PriceList.mfg  Inventory.mfg     AND PriceList.idxno  Inventory.idxno    WHERE PriceList.idxno LIKE idxno    ORDER BY PriceList.idxno    LIMIT page,15 mysqliclosedbconnect gt   codepre  pOK, I did as Jeff suggested I hope,  p  precodemysqlgt SET GLOBAL generallog  ON Query OK, 0 rows affected 0.00 sec codepre  pand then looked at varlibmysqldebian7.log file, This is the resultsp  precode141012 180730   148 Connect   rootlocalhost on lawn2           148 Query           149 Connect   rootlocalhost on lawn2           149 Query            149 Quit             150 Connect   rootlocalhost on lawn2           150 Query            150 Quit             151 Connect   rootlocalhost on lawn2           151 Query            151 Quit   141012 180731   148 Quit   codepre  pThere is a 148 Quit after a 151 Quit,br So I added a codemysqliclosedbconnectcode at the end of partlookup.php file.  p  pbut it made no difference, still having same problem.p
Negative 1469 pI have been racking my brain over this all weekend and cannot seem to figure out this last part. I am to write an assembly program to calculate the nth number in the tetrabonacci series. For example p  precode     n 012345 6 7  output 11248152956  codepre  pThe codencode is sent from a C which I have already wrote. The assembly program accepts the n entry and pushes it into the stack decrements the number and adds up to the last 4 prior numbers. My code works except that it does not work, it is a number off when I enter any number above 4. For example when I enter 4 it outputs 8 correctly but when I enter 5 it outputs 16 instead of 15 and 6 outputs 32 instead of 29 like it should. If you can assist I would greatly appreciate it. p  pBelow is my code p  precodeTITLE Tetrabonacci Series  .586 .model flat,C  .code  Tetrabonacci PROC     push       ebp     mov        ebp, esp     push       ebx     sub        esp, 4     mov        eax, [ebp8]     cmp        eax, 0     ja         L1                 mov        eax, 1     jmp        done  L1     cmp        eax, 1     ja         L2     mov        eax, 1     jmp        done  L2      cmp        eax, 2     ja         L3     mov        eax, 2     jmp        done  L3     cmp        eax, 3     ja         L4     mov        eax, 4     jmp        done   L4       dec        eax     mov        [esp], eax     call       Tetrabonacci     mov        ebx, eax     mov        eax, [ebp8]     dec        eax     mov        [esp], eax     call       Tetrabonacci     lea        eax, [ebxeax]  done      add        esp, 4     pop        ebx     pop        ebp     ret Tetrabonacci ENDP END codepre

Negative 1469 pthis is my first question on stackoverflow so please bear with my noobness.  I am writing a cordova app with ionic framework and i am trying to upload multiple files from the camera to a server while displaying the uploaded files in a list and showing the progress for each of them.

I am trying to use the ID of the File i get after i push it to the array, but those seem to be incorrect sometimes.

Negative 1469 pI am using Jqgrid Treegrid to display some hierarchical data.

Negative 1469 pHere is my setup I got a div on my main page with links, they are draggable. This works.p  pI now got an iframe. If something is clicked on the iframe it replaces the content within a div on the main page ajax call to update the div on the main page. This works, but now draggable does not work.p  pHere is code within the php page in the iframe a hrefhttppastebin.comQy70D3YH relnofollowhttppastebin.comQy70D3YHap  pnote doa func is called onclick for links within the iframe. p  pThe problem Other then , parent.document testabv this is a copypaste of the function call in the roottop page. This does not work. When I use this code and try to drag something the entire screen scrolls down as a move the mouse while dragging. p  pedit I am not sure how to fix this, because even if its not scrolling it does not seem to call the droppable class.... But I did find a workaround.... Instead my iframe code is now calling my roottop page function to make it draggable within the success event window.parent.taskDraggable So in other words, the toproot function that has always worked is now doing all the work instead of trying to make it work within the iframe.p
Negative 1469 pSo, I have two static meshes no animation. I have an algorithm that can determine if they overlap collide using AABBs and detailed triangle overlap inspection. But now, I want to expand that by adding depth penetration computation.p  pI wrote something that can calculate depth penetration between two triangles as a minimum distance one of them has to travel in order to stop overlaping. The thing works fine with 2 triangles but cant give correct results for the whole mesh since clearing one pair doesnt necessarily mean clearing whole mesh overlap. Any ideas on how should I approach this problemp  pThe algorithm should be fast as it can be used for large number of objects.p
Negative 1469 pAs per a hrefhttpbooks.sonatype.commvnrefbookreferencepomrelationshipssectpomsyntax.htmlpomrelationshipssectsnapshotversions7C relnofollowthe manuala, with Maven 3 were forced to use codeuniqueSnapshotstruecode. This means that each deployment of code1.0SNAPSHOTcode is actually backed by some unique, canonical ID e.g. code1.0200802072308031code.p  pAs a result, invoking codemvn deploycode produces artifacts whose canonical version cannot be determined before the codemvncode executable is invoked.p  pTherefore, if one wishes to invoke any operations on the unique ID generated afterwards, one must try to extract the generated ID from the maven executable after codemvn deploycode completes.p  pIs there any such mechanism to obtain the unique ID p  pFor example, codemvn deploycode will produce the following outputp  precodeUploading httpsoss.sonatype.orgcontentrepositoriessnapshotsioairliftslice0.11SNAPSHOTslice0.1120150220.1654042.jar codepre  pBut there seems to be no way to access the ID code0.1120150220.1654042code without parsing the output from Maven.p  pExample scenario mvn build results in a new unique artifact being pushed to an internal repository manager. After that completes, we wish to push a notification over HTTP to inform some remote application of a new SNAPSHOT version of the application.p  pAlthough our repository manager allows us to query for the latest SNAPSHOT version, this is emnotem the same as being able to pass absolute references to specific versions around.p
Negative 1469 pOk.. this could be a bit of a challenge. Basically I need to select an image and I want it to fade in and out every few seconds. p  pUnder normal circumstances it would be fairly straightforward... but the problem is the site Im working on has certain restrictions. p  pFirstly the image has no ID or class only alt text, and I cant edit this to add a class  it is sitting in a table that does have classes but I cant seem to work out how to drill down to select the specific image using Javascript.... the system also doesnt support jQuery.p  pI can do it using CSS no problem codeTABLE.tableClass TD.tdClass IMG code But unfortunately the system can only be viewed in IE78 so CSS3 isnt an option to make the image blink. p  pIf anyone has any suggestions Id really appreciate it. The best was I can think of would be to select the table, then the td, then the first image within it... but I cant seem to work out how this would be done in js.p  pMany thanks in advancep

Negative 1469 pI have been reading about docker, but im confused on how a nice workflow can be maintained for deploying an application hosted on github, to be deployed into a docker container on a cloud service. For example, a web application written for nodeJS, to be hosted on EC2. I develope the app on my local computer, and check it into github.  To manage deployment of this, what is a typical way of doing thisp  ul lipCheck my dockerfile into github. My dockerfile tells docker to pull my application from a different github repository when the container is run. When my EC2 instance boots, get it to checkout my dockerfile and run it, resulting in a deployment of my application Perhaps typically there is no need to check in the dockerfile and just deploy is straight What happens when I make code changes, do I have to relaunch an EC2 instance pli lipRely completley on docker hub Create my application in a docker container on my local box.

Negative 1469 pim trying to display the change history for a sharepoint list item.p  pTo do so i created a separate view in the infopath template where i use a repeating table hooked to a data connection and filtered by the ids the ids that use for the filter are not the ones generated by sharepoint but rather ones that are generated manually with a predefined format,inside the repeating table i added a formatting rule where i only display the item that have the same id as the one being edited.p  pi was hoping that this will display all the records that have the same id but different version, except it only shows the item that is currently being edited. i checked in the sharepoint list that versioning is enabled and that the items im using to test do have history.p  pDue to an internal security policy all i can do is addremove columns from the list or modify the template.p

Negative 1469 pUsing a WPF datagrid to change underlying data in the supporting database. Im using an SQLDataAdapter .Update method to send datagrid changes to the DB code below on the end row editing event.p  pThis is hard to explain, but if I make a change to a cell and hit the enter key, the end row editing event fires but nothing happens in the DB. If I make another change, the end row editing event fires as before, but this time the DB reflects the emfirstem change.  Its like Im out of sync or something. I need a hint to get some new thinking.

Negative 1469 pYou have to contract for supporting non public available Java releases with Oracle for example Java6 ended with 1.6.045 publicly but with support you can use 1.6.080. Our aim is to stay supported and public available java platform. Therefore we want to migrate our jnlp based RIA application from Java6 to java8 platform. In migration testing we have experienced performance problem. We try to simulate this problem in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28046809java8poorguiperformancecomparedtojava6Java 8 poor GUI performance compared to Java 6a but we realize that the problem not related the that question. p  pAfter the introduction, in order to find out the root cause of problem we profiled the application with java mission controljmc bundled with jdk. when we profile application launched at workspace we cannot see any performance degradation. And then we realize that problem occurs only JAVAWS environment. Our application runs as expected at java environment but in javaws environment some GUIs are really slow , it adds 6 seconds more to response time.p  pstrongMy first question is that how we profile java application launched by javawsstrong Because to use jmc we need to set some JVM arguments codejavavmargsXXUnlockCommercialFeatures XXFlightRecordercode but javaws doesnt support this JVM parameters. You can find supported list at a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase8docstechnotesguidesjavawsdevelopersguidesyntax.htmlresources relnofollowhereap  pstrongMy Second question is that why application doesnt run identical at both environmentjava and javawsstrong We examined signed and unsigned version of our application and both have same situation.

Negative 1469 pIm cleaning data in Excel that has a date column with mmddyyyy values mixed with ddmmyyyy values where the former are date formatted and the latter are general formatted. The way Im doing this is to filter out everything thats date formatted ie shows up in the filter as 1964  March  27, etc... at various levels, leaving only those that are general formatted shows up in the filter as as 27031964. When I do this, I find that there are still dateformatted cells visible. Im wondering why this is Is it a consequence of how the filter works or how Excel reads date valuesp

Negative 1469 pIn my program I am allocating a lot of arrays millions and they are all quite small in size.p  pBecause it is faster to allocate a large block of memory than small ones repeatedly, I was looking for a way to just allocate a large block of memory, keep a pointer to the current position in that block to draw the next array from, and then allocating another large block when that one is exhausted.p  pIs this possible to do in C and if so, how I have a feeling codeMarshal.AllocHGlobalcode may be what Im looking for, but Im not quite sure if C has a more managed way of doing so.p  pAs an example, Id like to allocate a memory block of 1,000 bytes, and then later create an array of length 4 that uses the first 4 bytes, and then later create an array of length 3 that uses the next 3 bytes.p

Negative 1469 pMy app has a split layout panel with a vertical dragger gwtSplitLayoutPanelVDragger. It hasnt been customized at all.

Negative 1469 pIm working on a Storyboard in Xcode, and I added a Label to a view controller Im working on. Since I try to make all of my apps use AutoLayout, my first reaction is to add AutoLayout constraints to the Label. So I add 2 constraints to the Top and Left edges of the superview the Label is in. And I also add constraints on the Label itself for Width and Height, and I know that I can modify the value of the constraints afterwards to set them to what I want them to be. My Storyboard looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVKDr5.png altLabel with 4 constraintsp  pThen I realized that I forgot to change the name of the Label to something more descriptive. Since this is the Title label for my main view, I renamed the Label to Title and also renamed the top level View to MainView. So now my Storyboard looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comiPGkF.png altTitle in MainView with constraintsp  pThen I realized that my constraints still reference Label and View, so I go to rename them. I highlighted the constraint for Width, pressed enter and got an edit text field and replaced the word Label with Title and hit enter again. The edit text field closed, but the constraint name went back to being Label instead of Title like I typed. I tried again, same result. I tried with the Height constraint, same result. It wouldnt let me change the name of the constraint. So I deleted the Width constraint and remade a Width constraint. Now it has the right name referencing Title instead of Label. But I dont want to have to delete the constraint and recreate it every time I change the name of a UI element the constraint is tied to.p  pIs there any way to rename a constraint after I change the name of an element that the constraint is tied top
Negative 1469 pI have an assignment to randomly generate a maze weird ones are valid as well, then I have to find all solutions for the maze a solution being finding a way from the first row or column to the last row or column, also determine the shortest one.

Also, in the assignment it said we had to solve this on a 20x20 maze. If it overflows on a 5x5, can you imagine a 20x20 Anyway, any help would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 1469 pIm very new to Python, and Im going through some example projects I found online but Im stuck on my palindrome checker at the moment.p  pRight now, my code takes a word as an input, splits it in half, saves each part into separate variables, makes both of the variables lists, and from there it SHOULD reverse the second list so I can compare it to the first, but from what Ive gathered trying to fix it, its only appending half of the selection to the new list.p  pFor example, if I enter racecar, itll split it into race and ecar just fine, but then when I go to reverse ecar it only gives me back [c, e]. Also, if I switch the variables around to reverse the first half, I get the same errorp  pIve been trying to figure it out for quite a while now and Im not making any progress so some help would be very much appreciatedp  pNinja Edit If theres an easier way to do this which Im sure there is Id love to know, but I still want to figure out what Ive done wrong in the code I already have so I can try to learn from itp  pHeres my code so farp  precodeprint Please enter a word you want to check is a palindrome input  rawinputgt   Gets lengths of input fulllength  leninput splitlength  leninput  2  If word has an even length split like this if fulllength  2  0     firsthalf  input[0 splitlength]     secondhalf  input[splitlengthfulllength]  If word does not have even length split like this else     firsthalf  input[0splitlength1]     secondhalf  input[splitlengthfulllength]  Make both halves lists firsthalflist  listfirsthalf print firsthalflist secondhalflist  listsecondhalf print secondhalflist   Reverse second half revsecondhalf  []   for x in secondhalflist     currentletter  secondhalflist[0]     secondhalflist.removesecondhalflist[0]     revsecondhalf.insert0, currentletter  print revsecondhalf   Check to see if both lists are identical  If they are identical print This word is a palindrome  If they are not identical print This word is not a palindrome.  codepre  pAnd this is the output I get when I enter racecarp  precoderacecar [r,a,c,e] [e,c,a,r] [c, e] codepre

Negative 1469 pI have a question that is probably more general than djangorelated development.  The background is quite simplep  pI am working on a project whose pages are mostly associated with a web application this is what I am using Django for.  In addition to the apprelated pages, however, there are quite a few auxiliary pages like a landing page, a faq page, a contact page, etc. that have basically nothing to do with the web app.  p  pWhat is the standard strategy for deploying such a project  It seems flawed to route requests to these static pages through Django.  What seems to make sense is running two servers one responsible for running the Django app and a a separate server that is responsible for serving the static pages including, perhaps, the static content used by the app portion of the web site .  p  pWhat are some guiding principles that should be employed when making these decisionsp

Negative 1469 pIve been given a problem in my data structures class to find the solution to this problem. Its similar to an interview question. If someone could explain the thinking process or solution to the problem. Pseudocode can be used. So far ive been thinking to use tries to hold the dictionary and look up words that way for efficiency.p  pThis is the problemp  pOh, no You have just completed a lengthy document when you have an unfortunate FindReplace mishap. You have accidentally removed all spaces, punctuation, and capitalization in the document. A sentence like I reset the computer. It still didnt boot would become iresetthecomputeritstilldidntboot. You figure that you can add back in the punctation and capitalization later, once you get the individual words properly separated. Most of the words will be in a dictionary, but some strings, like proper names, will not.p  pGiven a dictionary a list of words, design an algorithm to find the optimal way of unconcatenating a sequence of words. In this case, optimal is defined to be the parsing which minimizes the number of unrecognized sequences of characters.p  pFor example, the string jesslookedjustliketimherbrother would be optimally parsed as JESS looked just like TIM her brother. This parsing has seven unrecognized characters, which we have capitalized for clarity.p

Negative 1469 pI am trying to make a little app which reads codes given files and must parse them. It may not compile, because the code I am providing is already compiled. strongWhat I needstrong is that I can read all infos of the code using something similar to codeSystem.Reflections FieldInfo, MethodInfo, ...code.p  pI have tried compiling that code as a DLL and then usep  precodeAssemblyassembly.GetExportedTypes[x].GetMethods  Assemblyassembly.GetExportedTypes[x].GetFields  codepre  pIt does a lot of the work, but I am facing the problem that it gives me strongOnly the public declarationsstrong only the public methods, and public fields I am unable to read less access declarations, private, internal, protected.p  pHow can I obtain thisp  pAdditional Info I just need the names and the types of the declarations p  precodemethodType, methodName, variableType, variableName codepre
Negative 1469 pAs I understand, Scheme uses passbyvalue when calling functions.

So I dont see how setcar of a copy of that variable could change the car part of the original object itself the queue variable.p  pCan someone explain to me how it really works Is the queue variable wrapped as an address to a pairp

Negative 1469 pLong winded out of necessity p  pI have a strongly typed MVC 4 form. The form is built dynamically depending on the current URL parameters. When the user submits the form, the form input data is posted to a controller, the controller does its thing, then the results from the controller method need to be displayed below the form. p  pSpecifically in my case the results are line item ticket data. The user can hit submit as many times as they want and each time the additional results from the controller are displayed on the same page below the form Each post is an added line item. The line items are requestedstored by a call to an external webapi, so each time a submit happens I rebuild the line items from my controller method. p  pWhat I am trying to do is not have the page refresh every time to build the form all over again while simply updating the line items below the form through an ajax call. The form is expensive to build because it also is built from an external web api call. My model is very large and has a lot of data even though the form itself isnt. p  pWhat I have attempted so far is to put the line items into a partial view, which I will update after each form submit. Im submitting the form with jQuery and Ajax. What seems to be happening is the form is submitted, the ajax method is called, but my controller is returning the partial view and master page layout directly. Its not returning back to the jQuery call. This could be Sitefinity or it could be something Im doing completely wrong. p  pWhat I have so far is this a hrefhttpbeta.kentuckycenter.orgallshowsjeffbeck relnofollowhttpbeta.kentuckycenter.orgallshowsjeffbecka. Click on Buy Tickets on this page to see form.p  pSubmit the form Press GO then the form submits and only returns the partial view. p  pBut it should look like this this is design only  a hrefhttpwww.kentuckycenter.org.staging01.spiiider.comselecttickets.php relnofollowhttpwww.kentuckycenter.org.staging01.spiiider.comselecttickets.phpap  pSitefinity MVC widgets change the complexity for sure. My setup is Master page Sitefinity templates are built from master pages, then default view, and partial view. Im trying to update the partial view inside the default view. p  pIve tried many different ways including ajax.beginform form but I still cant seem to get a partial view to return inside a default view.

Negative 1469 pI have a problem generating entities with netbeans ide if a table have more than one relationship with another table. p  pI have, for example, a task table with three references to user table the user who created the task, the user who have to track the task and the user who is executing it. Every relationship has its name fkusercreated, fkuserresp, fkuserdo.p  pNetbeans generate three collections UserCollection1, UserCollection2 and UserCollection3. Not only the names are unclear but, when I regenerate the entities, they change order.p  pIs there a way to tell netbeans to use the foreign key name instead of the table or column name p  pI know I can directly write entities instead of automatically generate them, but this is not the case, Im testing solutions and different database structures and I keep track manually of every change is not practical.p  pThank youp

Negative 1469 pI have an array containing double values in the ViewController. I want to plot these values in a tableviewcell depending on the value. the actual values shouldnt appear as text.

Negative 1469 pI have a create new album form on my page along side a delete album form. On the sucess of the album create I would like to automatically update the checkbox list that is in the delete album form with the newly created album details. The delete album form gets its checkbox delete list by using php within the page. Deleting an album uses an ajax call triggered by the album delete button, on success return of the php delete script the checkbox and parent div is removed. At this time for the delete form list to get updated the page has to be reloaded. Is there a way to update the delete list without reloading the page. All the posts I have looked at talk about append html with json message which isnt going to work, and I havent yet seen a solution that enables refreshing a div like refreshing a page although ultimately if there doesnt seem to be another way then thats what I will have to trigger in my album create success return.p  pstrongjquery for add new albumstrongp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt  document.readyfunction       addnewcatagory.clickfunction       ifcatagoryname.val  albumDescription.val         addAlbumError.htmlPlease enter Album Name and Album Description          return false         else       addAlbumError.htmlltimg srcimageajaxloader.gif width16 height16 altgt     var albumNamecatagoryname.val     var albumDescriptionalbumDescription.val   .postincludesaddalbumncatagory.inc.php,albumnamealbumName,albumdescriptionalbumDescription,functionjson        ifjson.result  success           addAlbumError.htmljson.message          addcategory.get0.reset        else         addAlbumError.htmljson.message                  submit click doc ready ltscriptgt codepre  pstronghtml form for delete album that I woud like to refreshstrongp  precodeltdiv classlistalbumgt    ltdiv iddeleteAlbumtitlegtDelete Albumltdivgt  ltform actionincludesdeletealbum.inc.php idalbumdeletegt        ltpgt              ltphp              whilerow  mysqlifetcharrayresult3 gt            ltdiv idalbumecholistgt              ltinput namealbumid typecheckbox idaddImage valueltphp echo row[albumid]gtgt               ltphp echo row[albumname]gt ltphp echo gtltphp echo row[albumDescription]gt ltphp echo ltbrgtgt   ltdivgt              ltphp  gt             ltbrgt ltpgt           ltformgt   ltinput namesubmit typebutton iddeletealbumbut styledisplaynone titleDelete Album valueDelete Album formalbumdeletegt      ltdiv iddeleteAlbumNotice styledisplay blockgtChoose an Album to DeleteltbrgtBy Deleting an Album all pictures and subdirectories in the Album will be Deleted Alsoltdivgt    ltdiv iddeleteAlbumgtltdivgt  ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pI hope I managed to explain this properly and I have posted the relevent codep

Negative 1469 pI am trying to select a timestamp in MyBatis and return it as a LocalDateTime from jodatime.p  pMy configuration works fine if I try to return the result as a codejava.sql.Timestampcode. I proved my type handler works fine if I use a wrapping class with a codeLocalDateTimecode as only field and a resultMap in the MyBatis mapper file, I get the correct results.p  pHowever, when I try specifying the codeorg.joda.time.LocalDateTimecode as coderesultTypecode for this select, I always get codenullcode, as if the type handler is ignored.p  pIt is my understanding that MyBatis uses a default typeHandler in the case I have coderesultTypejava.sql.Timestampcode. As a consequence, I expected it to use one of the typeHandlers I configured when meeting coderesultTypeorg.joda.time.LocalDateTimecode.p  pDid I miss something Is there a way to make use of my typeHandler or am I forced to make a wrapper class and resultMap This is my fallbackto solution but I would like to avoid it if possible.p  pAny help appreciated.

Negative 1469 pstrongIm wondering what is the best way to go about object initialization and storagestrong with regards to objects that have to have a relatively large scope  long lifetime. Lets say we have a codeGameEnginecode class that needs to initialize and hold a reference to a codeWindowcode for rendering. The reference is needed throughout the programs lifetime and the window needs to know its dimensions, at least.p  pIn Java, Id do it like thisp  precode Declaration Window window  Initialization window  new Windowwidth, height codepre  pI understood that in C, the first would already call the default constructor of the Window class, hence be strongdeclarationstrong and stronginitializationstrong. Having a codewindow  Windowwidth, heightcode would therefore be strongassignmentstrong, throwing away the already existing object.p  pstrongThe first solution I could find was to use a pointerstrongp  precode GameEngine.hpp class GameEngine      Window window    Somewhere in GameEngine.cpp window  new Windowwidth, height codepre  pBut then again, I constantly read one should favor plain objects over pointers whenever possible and in fact, I got myself into a mess of pointers in no time, so I am looking for another way.p  pstrongAnother solution seems to design your objects to have a constructor without parameters and set up the object later onstrongp  precode GameEngine.hpp class GameEngine      Window window    Somewhere in GameEngine.cpp window.setWidthwidth window.setHeightheight codepre  pThis works, but has a serious drawback the object at least in this case could be in an inconsistent state, as trying to display the window without setting widthheight would result in an error or crash. It does work for some objects, but for most it does not.p  pstrongOne way to avoid this would be to have default values. For example, the constructor for the Window class could look like thisstrongp  precodeWindowWindowint width  800, int height  600  codepre  pstrongOr even like thatstrongp  precodeWindowWindow  widthDEFAULTWIDTH, heightDEFAULTHEIGHT  codepre  pBut in many cases, default values will be hard to determine. Also, where should they be coming from Should the Window class define codeDEFAULTWIDTHcode and codeDEFAULTHEIGHTcode strongOr should I even do thisstrongp  precode GameEngine.hpp class GameEngine      static const int DEFAULTWIDTH  800     static const int DEFAULTHEIGHT  600     Window window800,600  codepre  pBut that seems bad, as Ive read that you should not do any initialization in the header, only declaration, so the values of codeDEFAULTWIDTHcode and codeDEFAULTHEIGHTcode should not actually be known at this point and only be initialized in the .cpp, correct.p  pstrongAm I missing an optionstrong Or is it common in C to assume that the programmer should know what hes doing and take care of getting his objects in a consistent state before using them strongWhen to use which approachstrongp
Negative 1469 pSonatype requires the nonSNAPSHOT version artifacts to be GPGsigned the public OpenPGP keys should be uploaded to a MIT key server.p  pBut anyone can create any OpenPGP key with any name an email and upload them to the key server. There is as far as I know or am I wrong no automatic mechanism in place to associate a particular software projectlibrary with a particular public key. Sure, if anyone wants to check the authenticity of the artifacts, one can always request the public key from the software authors, or perhaps the key is already published somewhere in a way that associates it with the particular software project but since this can not be done automatically, hardly anyone ever does it.p  pSo it seems that the whole OpenPGPsigning procedure, also by being quite technical and timeconsuming, serves more to instill a false sense of security than actually providing much security to the average user.p  pSo shouldnt there be an automaticstreamlined way to associate software projects with OpenPGP keys to make the whole thing actually securep

Negative 1469 pFunctional Reactive Programming is an approach to specify sideeffecting programs in a pure functional way.p  pRecently Ive been using rxscala, which is the JavaScala port port of ReactiveX.

These are similar to the functions that can be applied to collections. And those are already quite well understood, as we know codeFoldablecode, codeTraversablecode, codeApplicativecode, codeMonadscode and the like. p  pIndeed observables are foldable, traversable monads, like ordinary collections. But these traits can be implemented in multiple ways for observables, as an observable holds much more information the timing information for each element than an ordinary collection. And the result also has to be fitted with timing information. p  h2Two Monad implementationsh2  pFor example the monadic codejoincode codeflatMapcode in Scala can be implemented in at least two different, plausible waysp  ul lipBy codeswitchcodeing between the nested observables, which results in truncating the currently active observable, once the next one begins emission, orp  pimg srchttpreactivex.iodocumentationoperatorsimagesswitch.c.png altRxJava Switch Visualizationpli lipby codemergecodeing the nested observables without dropping or delaying any events.p  pimg srchttpreactivex.iodocumentationoperatorsimagesmergeDelayError.C.png altRxJava Merge Visualizationpli lip... and much much more see the commentspli ul  h2Limitationsh2  pIm very pleased with the provided repertoire of combinator functions, but I keep running into situations where Im not able to achieve what I want, and I have to fall back to some kind of concurrent programming.p  h2Missing combinators or brainsh2  pNow Im wondering whether Im just too stupid to construct the desired behavior using existing combinators.

Negative 1469 pIm developing an iOS app using xCode 6.3. This project uses Cocoapods for a number of libraries. I always open the xcode workspace, not the project file. p  pWhen I build the app in debug mode, I get 300 duplicate symbol errors which of course causes the build to fail. To remedy this, I removed the libpods.a from the Link binary with Libraries list and then it works. But now when I go to archive it for upload to the app store, it fails with an ld library not found for lPodsMixpanel error.  p  pIf I add libpods.a back to the list, I can archive it, but then I cant build it in debug mode. p  pIve checked all the settings multiple times and I cant see where theres any difference between the debug and release modes.p  pHow can I fix this problem or get more information to debug itp  pEdit Here are the flags from my projectp  pOther librarian flags OTHERLDFLAGSp  pOther linker flags inheritedp  pXcode evaluates both of these and fills them in, but I cant copy or view the full text.

This comes back as a 302 redirect with the correct url that was set from LogoutSuccessHandler.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comr083b.png altsignout 302 responsep  pThe browser then attempts to load signinmYou20have20been20logged20out but it resends the strongOLDstrong cookie that was supposedly deleted in the 302 response from POST signout. This causes another redirect since the JSESSION cookie we sent has been invalidated and then we lose my pretty message.  Any ideas on how I can prevent this behavior or ensure the browser deletes cookies properly on a 302 redirect in response to a POST request  Ive tested on the latest Firefox and Chrome and the behavior is the same.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFeNSt.png altenter image description herep

Negative 1469 pMe and a colleague are trying to achieve a simple polymorphic class hierarchy. Were working on an embedded system and are restricted to only using a C compiler. We have a basic design idea that compiles without warnings Wall Wextra fstrictaliasing pedantic and runs fine under gcc 4.8.1.p  pHowever, we are a bit worried about aliasing issues as we do not fully understand when this becomes a problem.p  pIn order to demonstrate we have written a toy example with an interface IHello and two classes implementing this interface Cat and Dog.p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt    IHello   struct IHello typedef struct IHello      void SayHelloconst struct IHello self, const char greeting  IHello   Helper function  void SayHelloconst IHello self, const char greeting      selfgtSayHelloself, greeting     Cat   typedef struct Cat      IHello hello     const char name     int age  Cat  void CatSayHelloconst IHello self, const char greeting      const Cat cat  const Cat self     printfs I am a cat My name is s and I am d years old.n,            greeting,            catgtname,            catgtage   Cat CatCreateconst char name, const int age      static const IHello catHello   CatSayHello      Cat cat      cat.hello  catHello     cat.name  name     cat.age  age      return cat     Dog   typedef struct Dog      IHello hello     double weight     int age     const char sound  Dog  void DogSayHelloconst IHello self, const char greeting      const Dog dog  const Dog self     printfs I am a dog I can make this sound s I am d years old and weigh .1f kg.n,            greeting,            doggtsound,            doggtage,            doggtweight   Dog DogCreateconst char sound, const int age, const double weight      static const IHello dogHello   DogSayHello      Dog dog      dog.hello  dogHello     dog.sound  sound     dog.age  age     dog.weight  weight      return dog    Client code  int mainvoid      const Cat cat  CatCreateMittens, 5     const Dog dog  DogCreateWoof, 4, 10.3      SayHelloIHello ampcat, Good day     SayHelloIHello ampdog, Hi there      return 0  codepre  pOutputp  pGood day I am a cat My name is Mittens and I am 5 years old.p  pHi there I am a dog I can make this sound Woof I am 4 years old and weigh 10.3 kg.p  pWere pretty sure the the upcast from Cat and Dog to IHello is safe since IHello is the first member of both these structs.p  pOur real concern is the downcast from IHello to Cat and Dog respectively in the corresponding interface implementations of SayHello. Does this cause any strict aliasing issues Is our code guaranteed to work by the C standard or are we simply lucky that this works with gccp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThe solution that we eventually decide to use must be standard C and cannot rely on e.g. gcc extensions. The code must be able to compile and run on different processors using various proprietary compilers.p  pThe intention with this pattern is that client code shall receive pointers to IHello and thus only be able to call functions in the interface. However, these calls must behave differently depending on which implementation of IHello that was received. In short, we want identical behaviour to the OOP concept of interfaces and classes implementing this interface.p  pWe are aware of the fact that the code only works if the IHello interface struct is placed as the first member of the structs which implement the interface. This is a limitation that we are willing to accept.p  pAccording to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9747010Does accessing the first field of a struct via a C cast violate strict aliasingap  blockquote   p6.7.2.113p      pWithin a structure object, the nonbitfield members and the units in which bitfields reside have addresses that increase in the order in which they are declared. A pointer to a structure object, suitably converted, points to its initial member or if that member is a bitfield, then to the unit in which it resides, and vice versa. There may be unnamed padding within a structure object, but not at its beginning.p      pThe aliasing rule reads as follows 6.57p      pAn object shall have its stored value accessed only by an lvalue expression that has one of the following typesp      ul   lia type compatible with the effective type of the object,li   lia qualified version of a type compatible with the effective type of the object,li   lia type that is the signed or unsigned type corresponding to the effective type of the object,li   lia type that is the signed or unsigned type corresponding to a qualified version of the effective type of the object,li   lian aggregate or union type that includes one of the aforementioned types among  its members including, recursively, a member of a subaggregate or contained union, orli   lia character type.li   ul blockquote  pAccording to the fifth bullet above and the fact that structures contain no padding at the top we are fairly sure that upcasting a derived struct that implements the interface to a pointer to the interface is safe, i.e.p  precodeCat cat const IHello catPtr  const IHello ampcat  Upcast    Inside client code  void Greetconst IHello interface, const char greeting       Users do not need to know whether interface points to a Cat or Dog.      interfacegtSayHellointerface, greeting  Dereferencing should be safe   codepre  pThe big question is whether the downcast used in the implementation of the interface functions is safe. As seen abovep  precodevoid CatSayHelloconst IHello hello, const char greeting       Is the following statement safe if we know for       a fact that hello points to a Cat       Does it violate strict aliasing rules      const Cat cat  const Cat hello      Access internal state in Cat   codepre  pAlso note that changing the signature of the implementation functions top  precodeCatSayHelloconst Cat cat, const char greeting DogSayHelloconst Dog dog, const char greeting codepre  pand commenting out the downcast also compiles and runs fine. However, this generates a compiler warning for function signature mismatch.p

Negative 1469 pI have a graph G  V,E with weighted edges all positive integers and I have the shortest path of this graph from source vertex A and destination vertex B lets say this shortest path is equal to 100 found by using Dijkstras Algorithm.p  pI want to figure out all the ways that I could reconstruct this graph with the same amount of edges and nodes but modifying the connections between nodes to be the absolute shortest until I reach 100 again the old shortest path without the reconstructionp  pFor example, I could reconstruct the graph with A connected to Z with a weight of 1 and my shortest path would therefor be 1 and that would be 1 way of reconstructing the graph. Another way would be A to B to Z with a weight of 1 on each edge to give the total path a distance of 2. However, I also want to count the path that we could reconstruct with A to Z having a weight of 2...99 initially and this would still satisfy the condition of this path being shorter than the first path 100 p  pIm trying to figure out a way to find all the possible paths that could be reconstructed that have a lower distance than the initial shortest path from the initial graph. p  pThe only constraints are that I must still use all the Vertices and Edges that were in the first graph, but I can change the weight and the edges to be any combination that makes the shortest path shorter than before. p  pEDIT The goal is not to find the shortest path, but the maximum amount of graphs that could be reconstructed with a path from A to Z that are less than the initial graphs shortest path from A to Z. See comments below for further clarification.p

Negative 1469 pI am looking for an efficient algorithm to solve the following problem p  pGiven a directed, weighted graph strongG  V,Estrong, a source vertex strongSstrong, a destination vertex strongTstrong, and strongMstrong, a subset of strongVstrong, Its required to find the shortest path from strongSstrong to strongTstrong.br A special feature present in strongMstrong is that each vertex in strongMstrong, once visited, the weight of a certain edge changes to another value. Both the edge and the new weight will be given for each vertex in strongMstrong. p  pTo help in understanding the problem, a hrefhttpi.imgur.com5bIKDaF.jpg relnofollowI have drawn an example using mspainta. sorry for the quality.p  pIn this example, the regular shortest path from strongSstrong to strongTstrong is strong1000strong. However, visiting the vertex strongCstrong will reduce the edge weight from strong1000strong to just strong500strong, so the shortest path in this case is strong200strongstrong100strongstrong500strongstrong800strong.p

Negative 1469 pIm using an annotation processor to generate a source file.  This works, the class gets added in targetclasses and I can import it and use it as expected.p  pIts kind of annoying though because everywhere I use that source file intellij highlights it as red because it doesnt know about it.p  pIs it possible to somehow add that generated file somewhere that intellij knows about it and can use it to autocomplete things  I realize the file would potentially be slightly dated because it might change the next time the annotation processor is invoked, but Im okay with that because it is fairly static.  I could also copy the file to my main src directory but that doesnt seem very DRY.p
