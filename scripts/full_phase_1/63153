Positive 63153 pThe gist of this question is that If I use Backbone.js code to clean up my views i.e. to prevent zombie views, then I am unable to set the element of a view if I click the back button in the browser, and therefore the view is getting rendered.p  pDetailsp  pI have a PostsView that displays a list of posts. In the constructor I call setElement and then render each member of the list using multiple PostListViewsp  precodeexport class PostsView extends Backbone.View       constructoroptions          this.setElementmain, true          super          this.render               addEachPostmodel        new PostListViewmodel model               render          this.collection.eachthis.addEachPost, this        codepre  pIf I click one of the PostListViews, then the router loads that PostListView onto the page, and if I click the back button, it reloads the Posts view onto the page, but only if I havent cleaned up the Posts view.For example, with this code, I can hit the back button and then another link and so on and it continues to load everything fine, but itll eventually create zombies because Im not cleaning up the viewsp  pRouterp  precode export class MyRouter extends Backbone.Router             constructoroptions                renderList,               postid showPost                        renderList              new PostsViewcollection this.collection                        showPostid              code ommitted              new PostViewmodel modle                codepre  pSo, I introduced some oftused code to prevent zombie views, but now if I do, when I hit the back button, the vip  pRouter code to clean up zombiep  precodechangeViewview      if this.currentView         this.currentView.close            this.currentView  view   codepre  pin the router, I then load views by callingp  precode         this.changeView new PostsViewcollection this.collection codepre  pHowever, if I do this, I can load the PostsView initially, but if I click one of the memebers of the list and then click back, the Posts view is not loading on the page. I noticed from inspecting the console that, in this situation, the codeelcode is not set to codemaincode, which is why its not getting onto the page. In the code where I dont clean up the zombie views, the codeelcode is set to codemaincode if I hit the back button. So, by cleaning up the zombies, Ive deleted the el and its not getting set again because the constructor is not run when I hit the codebackcode button.p  pQuestion is there some way to use the Router code that cleans up the zombie views, but at the same time to ensure that the constructor is run when I hit the back button in the browserp

Positive 63153 pIm trying to implement blueimps fileupload widget in our product as a generic attachment uploader. The widget works well on its own Im wondering if there is a way to use an external ajax call rather using the widgets built in function.

I can use the fileupload to to save my model and the files but it feels weird to do thisp  precodevar filesList  var f  fileupload.fileupload     url apifaqssave   f.onfileuploadadd, functione, data     filesList.pushdata.files[0]   button.clickfunctione     f.fileuploadsend, filesfilesList  codepre  pMy aim would be to use something like thisp  precodefileupload.fileupload ... .ajax     url apifaqssave,     data          question model.getquestion,         answer model.getanswer,         files filesList       codepre  pThis solution didnt work for me as it doesnt seem to send the correct payload to the server.

Positive 63153 pOften in my Backbone code I come across situations where I would be passing a closure to some function and lose context of this.p  pMy solution for some time had been to do what I had seen some others dop  precodevar self  this  this.deferred.donefunction       self.render  codepre  pOr actually I switched to codethis  thiscode, but thats beside the point. It works, but it feels ugly and I sometimes have to do it quite often. So Im trying to figure out a better way to do this. I learned I could do thisp  precodethis.deferred.donefunction       this.render .applythis codepre  pAnd I think I could also use Underscore to do thisp  precodethis.deferred.done.bindfunction       self.render , this codepre  pThe codeapplycode method seems the most succinct but I feel like it has a side effect I just dont know what it is yet.p  pEditp  pTake a look at this JSbin where I use apply similar to as I mentioned a hrefhttpjsbin.comqobumueditjs,console relnofollowhttpjsbin.comqobumueditjs,consoleap  pIt works, yet it throws an error at the same time.

Positive 63153 pIn developing large html pages with plenty of nested divs I found myself debugging the closing codeltdivgtcode tags. To get around this I started using javascriptp  precodevar div1  document.createElementdiv codepre  pThen I would simply use codediv1.appendChildsomethingElsecode to build the page, happy to never again worry about closing those DIV tags. As I progressed writing, I started enjoying making the html pages from javascript, letting the browser render the html from javascript.p  pThen my js code became unmanageable, with js all over the place. This brought me into looking at frameworks to get my code to the next level, which I have decided to incorporate backbone.js. This will help with developing a single page app. p  pTo implement backbone.js, I needed a whole bunch of up to date tutorials and books.  It seems like all tutorials are recommending template languagelibrary like handlebars, ejs, jade, etc.p  pI feel that this puts me back to debugging DIV tags.p  pMy question then becomes can I choose to not use a templating language for the views and build the view using javascript Did I miss a larger issue in wanting to do this Any examples, tutorials, out there p  pI guess I should add that I may want someone else to help with the code, so I know readability might be an issue, if not the issue.p

Positive 63153 pIn iOS 9 beta, a bug a hrefhttpsopenradar.appspot.com22186109 relnofollowhttpsopenradar.appspot.com22186109a was introduced that meant that setting codewindow.location.hashcode to some new value was not being updated until some time later. The exact meaning of some time is up for debate, but seems to be at least until the next js event loop tick.p  pAs an example, you would do something like thisp  precodelocation.hash  abcd console.loglocation.hash  probably not abcd  setImmediatefunction     console.loglocation.hash  probably abcd  codepre  pThis has caused an issue in our site which is using backbone.js router with hashchange navigation. Imagine that at the start of this example, the route is foo, and that before foo in the history was quux.p  pWe do something like thisp  precoderouter.navigatebar,  trigger true, replace false  codepre  pThe backbone.js history class would be invoked and call the routers to handle the navigationp  precodefunction onFooRoute    router.navigatebaz,  trigger true, replace true   codepre  pSo we started on foo, went to bar and then went to baz with replace set to true for the last one.p  pWe expect that we should end up on baz, and going back in history will take us back to foo.p  pThe issue we saw is that having done all of this, and once everything was settled down, going back in the history via codewindow.history.backcode, we go back to quux and not foo. It appears that because of the bug, the entry for bar doesnt stick into the browser history stack, and so the navigation to baz replaces foo instead of bar.p  pMy question is how best to fix this Can I patch backbone.js to workaround this issuep

The data sent to the third party seems to need to be sent using the post method.p  pHow can I achieve thisp  pI tried AJAX, but realised after a bit that AJAX isnt able to send info to external links so abandoned that.p  pEssentially the site needs to reload the page, validate the info sent to it, either return errors or add info the db and fire off the xml in the background, so having it send a separate form after reload isnt ideal either. Also the third party page when sent the xml through the main form loads its own page, which is far from pretty and takes the user away from our site, not good at all.p

So I try GetScrollPos and SetScrollPos to restore horizontal Scroll position, the ScrollBar goes to the right position but TDBGrid didnt scroll, here is the methodp  precodeprocedure TDBGrid.TitleClickColumn TColumn var   CurrenctPosition TBookmark   PosScroll Integer begin   inherited TitleClickColumn   if FAllowTitleClick and AssignedDataSource   and AssignedDataSource.DataSet   and DataSource.DataSet.Active   and AssignedColumn.Field   and Column.Field.FieldKind ltgt fkLookup then   begin     Get position scroll     PosScroll  GetScrollPosHandle, SBHORZ     CurrenctPosition  DataSource.DataSet.GetBookmark     FPaintInfo.ColPressed  False     FPaintInfo.ColPressedIdx  1     if ValidCellFCell then       InvalidateCellFCell.X, FCell.Y     SortColumnColumn     DataSource.DataSet.GotoBookmarkCurrenctPosition     Set position scroll     SetScrollPosHandle, SBHORZ, PosScroll, Truelt need to be refreshed   end end codepre  pThis can maybe fixed using PerformWMHSCROLL, SBLINERIGHT, 0 in loop but isnt good idea. Anybody have better solutionp
Negative 63153 pIs there a way to embed the last commands elapsed wall time in a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBashBasha prompt  Im hoping for something that would look like thisp  precode[last 0s][mydir] sleep 10 [last 10s][mydir] codepre  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI often run long datacrunching jobs and its useful to know how long theyve taken so I can estimate how long it will take for future jobs.  For very regular tasks, I go ahead and record this information rigorously using appropriate logging techniques.  For lessformal tasks, Ill just prepend the command with codetimecode.  p  pIt would be nice to automatically codetimecode every single interactive command and have the timing information printed in a few characters rather than 3 lines.  p

Negative 63153 pI have the following code that uses GTK widget toolkit to display a window with a button. Clicking this button will show a modal dialog. Note that the call to codegtkdialogruncode will recursively start another instance of the main loop, i.e. the codeonclickcode function will not return until the dialog box is dismissed.p  pI would like to have two of these toplevel windows, each with a button and the ability to spawn their own modal dialog. Showing the dialog would only disable the window that spawned it and there could be up to two active modal dialogs at the same time, one for each toplevel window.p  pIn win32, I could accomplish this simply by running each toplevel window in a separate thread.

Negative 63153 pI have a page with a Ext.form.ComboBox and a TinyMCE Editor, which uses an iframe for its body. The problem is that when the ComboBox has focus and the user clicks on the iframe, the ComboBoxs blur event is not fired. If the user clicks back to the ComboBox, the focus event is also not fired. However, document.activeElement does change to the iframe and back to the ComboBox correctly. Has anyone else had this problem or know of a fixworkaround for itp
Negative 63153 pFriends, p  pI would be grateful for a quick sanity check p  pWhen calling Oracle Reports 10g from Oracle Forms 10g, is it possible to run an Oracle Report and save it on the users PC to a specified directory I know that if an Oracle Report is run in such a format as PDF the user can save the report to x location. To call the Oracle report I am using the Oracle Forms builtin RunReportObject. p  pI dont think it is but would be happy to revise my opinion and to obtain such functionality I would have to implement something similar to what is discussed in this a hrefhttpforums.oracle.comforumsthread.jspamessageID43710174371017 relnofollowthreadap  pThanks in advance for any help that you can provide.p
Negative 63153 pIf I needed to do a left join between 2 tables in order to run some kind of analysis between them, but both datasets are too large for this to be executed in a single query, whats the best practice to accomplish thisp  pI saw FETCH in the documentation but wasnt sure if this is conventionally used to loop over entire datasets. Since I figured this task had to be commonplace, I wasnt going to kill myself trying to improperly hodgepodge FETCH or OFFSET in order to accomplish my analysis.p  pNote This is a local database, and will not be altered through the duration of the procedure  so performance considerations and transactions arent a factor.p  pIm using PostgreSQL, but Im sure the practice is similar across all modern DBMS.p

Negative 63153 pIm having an issue with a JFreeChart overlaid graph. Im using JFreeChart 1.0.13. What I am trying to do seems like it was easier to do in earlier versions of JFreeChartp  pThe graph shows a line chart and a bar chart. The data range plotted by the line chart for the Y axis is in the 0100 range, and the axis for the bar chart is in the 05 range. p  pIndividually, when I lay out each chart and paint it, they look great. Heres an examplep  pBar Chartimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLTwhg.png altalt text  Line Chartimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRCPCn.png altalt textp  pBut when I overlay them, the bar chart gets scaled down to look incredibly useless... presumably because the scales of the two datasets are so different.p  pExample img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comO2xkK.png altalt textp  pWhat I really want is to split the series data for the two datasets, and display the 0100 range for the line chart on the left hand Y axis and to have the bar chart displayed full size as in my first example below, but have the scale 05 displayed on the right hand Y axis side of the graph.p  pTo create the graph, I am first creating the bar chart using an XYSeriesCollection, adding the data and creating the plot...p  precodeXYSeriesCollection histogramDataset new XYSeriesCollection XYSeries xy new XYSeriesTemp xy.add100,0.0 xy.add101,0.3769791404875597 histogramDataset.addSeriesxy ... final NumberAxis xAxis  new NumberAxisTemperature C xAxis.setAutoRangeIncludesZerofalse final ValueAxis yAxis  new NumberAxisPercent Time above Temperature final XYItemRenderer renderer  new XYBarRenderer  final XYPlot plot  new XYPlotXYDataset histogramDataset, xAxis, yAxis, renderer codepre  pThen I create the line chart in a similar way and add the second series to the plot...p  precodefinal XYSeries xy  new XYSeriesFirst final XYDataset xySeriesData  new XYSeriesCollection final XYItemRenderer xyLineRenderer  new XYLineAndShapeRenderer xyLineRenderer.setSeriesShape0, new Line2D.Double0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 xyLineRenderer.setSeriesStroke0, new BasicStroke4.5f xy.add100,100.0 xy.add101,100.0 xyseriesData.addxy plot.setDataset1, xySeriesData plot.setRenderer1, xyLineRenderer plot.setDatasetRenderingOrderDatasetRenderingOrder.FORWARD codepre  pMy suspicion is that somehow each graph needs to be its own plot and combined together. Can anyone help What I am going for here is something like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.come6Z9o.png altalt textp  pExcept I dont want the bar chart to be a background image. The X axis should be the same, and the Y axis should be on the right hand side with the proper scale that allows the graph to be shown full size.p  pAnyall replies are appreciated...p

Oddly, if I put the app into a folder, and iTunes removes it, and then I reinstall it from Xcode, it will go back into that same folder.p  pThe only difference I can think of between this app and the others is that this was originally an iPadonly app, and then I changed it to an iPhoneiPad app. The app does work fine on the phone until iTunes removes it. Ive confirmed that iPhoneiPad is selected for the Targeted Device Family setting for all configurations. Ive also tried removing the development provisioning profile from the phone and reinstalling it.p  pDoes anyone know why iTunes would be removing this app even though it leaves the others alonep

The problem with that is inside this block I dont have access to the request object.p  pI guess another question would be in my case Im using functions as viewcallables, but lets say Ive written a seperate clients.py view file which holds all the views related to clients.

Negative 63153 pI have a website in which I have many categories, many subcategories within each one and many products within each of those. Since the URLs are very userunfriendly they contain a GUID, I would like to use a method which I think is called URL Masking. For example instead of going to catalogue.aspxItemID12343435323434243534, they would go to notpads.htm. This would display the same as going to catalogue.aspxItemID12343435323434243534 would display, somehow.p  pI know I could do this by creating a file for each category  subcategory individual products cannot be accessed individually as it is a wholesale site  customers cannot purchase directly from the site. This would be a lot of work as the server would have to update each relevant file whenever a category  subcategory  product visibility changes, or a description changes, a name changes... you get the idea...p  pI have tried using serverside includes but that doesnt like it when a .aspx file is specified in an html file.p  pI have also tried using an iframe set to 100 width  height and absolutely positioned left 0 and top 0. This works quite well, but I know there are reasons you should not use this method such as some search engines not coping with it well. I also notice that the title of the parent page notepads.htm is not the title set in the iframe logically this is correct  but another issue I need to solve if I go ahead and use this method.p  pCan anyone suggest another way I could do this, or tell me whether I am going along the right lines by using iframes Thanks.p  pRegards,p  pRichardp  pPS If this is the wrong name for what I am trying to do then please let me know what it actually is so I can rename  retag it.p

Negative 63153 pI am currently using Silverlight4 to build an OOB app with touch support.  I guess what Im doing would qualify as multitouch even though my app isnt using multiple touches at any point.

The buttons only enter their press state after a touch has been moved a fairly large amount on the touch screen.  If a user places their finger down directly on a button, Im never noticing the button entering the press state clicks come through fine however.p  pI would attach some code but there really isnt much code that is driving this.

Even this plain vanila button has the issuep  precodeltButton ContentCLICKMEgt codepre  pIs there anything obvious I am missing or is this just a known limitation with touch input in Silverlightp  pUPDATE It looks like this issue is simply that the standard SL button control is not made to handle touch input.

Negative 63153 pIm crosscompiling a project from Linux to target Windows using mingw. The output is a DLL and pinvoking into it from C works, but debugging is very difficult. The build outputs a .o file, which can provide symbols to gdb, but basically all I can do there is break on exceptions and find the name of the function that was executing when the exception happened not even the full stack trace. I cant debug with WinDbg because I dont have .pdb files.p  pThis is an open source project set up to build on Linux I believe their build process relies on several installed Linux packages to work.p  pDo I have any options here Is there a utility that can convert .o files into .pdb Or some program that can give me more information than gdb when debuggingp

Negative 63153 pAt my company we have several developers all working on projects internally, each with their own virtualbox setup. We use SVN to handle the source, but occasionally run into issues where a database MySQL schema change is necessary, and this has to be propagated to all of the other developers. At the moment we have a manuallywritten log file which lists what you changed, and the SQL needed to perform the change. p  pIm hoping there might be a better solution  ideally one linked to SVN, e.g. if you update to revision 893 the system knows this requires database revision 183 and updates your local schema automagically. Were not concerned with the data being synched, just the schema.p  pOf course one solution would be to have all developers running off a single, central database this however has the disadvantage that a schema change could break everyone elses build until they do an svn up.p

Negative 63153 pEnvironment Webphere 6, Solaris box, Thick client, Java web app.p  pNumber of request can be between 400  600. On each request to server, I am creating 15 threads using Java ExecutorService for requesting 15 different webservies simultaneously and group all the responses data together and send it back to user. Load test fails at nearly 150  170  users. CPU and memory spikes are seen in DB servicing these webservices and eventually after a very short period of time app server too crashes. Response time of webservice is 1012 sec max and 46 secs min. Connection pooling size of the DB is 40.p  pI am assuming that 150 request are creating 150152250 threads and app server resources are being spiked  and hence crashing.  So I want to use App server threadpool and have threadCount say 100 may not be good number... One thing thats troubling me is, with 100 threads I can process first 6 615  90 requests and 10 calls of 7th request. The next requests have to wait for 1015 secs for getting the threads back and then another 1015 secs for its own webservice call.  Is this approach even goodp  pAnother idea was asynchronous beans provided in Websphere.  Which one suits my requirement.p  pPlease suggest. Calling one webservice after another takes a total of 15lets say 4sec for each request  60 secs which is really bad. So calling webserices together is what I want to do. p
Negative 63153 pIm working with Silverlight, and we have several controls .ascx files that contain the code below in the html portion of the file.

The reason for this is because the .xap file is a custom file of ours that takes a bit to load, so we want it to be preloaded on pages that come before the ones that actually use Silverlight. So for example, our web site has a simple form login page that goes into a menu page where you choose which Silverlight application to load. What Id like to do is, for example, load the .xap file when the user clicks the login button, or even when they load the login page, and ideally in the background so the user doesnt notice it, so that when they finally get to the a page with Silverlight content, its ready and cached. Trying to paste the above code in the html portion of pages not running Silverlight just causes and infinite refresh loop and an alerted message of This request could not be processed.

Negative 63153 pIm not sure if I need a form for this, its a javascript that takes an input from a textbox, does some calculation on it, and displays the results in a div. I just want the user to be able to submit by clicking submit or by pressing enter. p  pIn short, if the button type is button, clicking works fine but pressing enter works strangely, and if the button type is submit, pressing enter works fine, but clicking works strangely.

There was no wireless connection at that site and no wired connection either.p  pIm back at my place now to diagnose the issue, and there is no issue  By process of elimination, I deduced the ONLY difference between then and now is that now I am on the internet.

These pages have tons of framework generated divs and CSS classes so it is not clear where the breakdown occurs... but here is my fundamental questionp  pWhat could IE9 be doing that simply shutting off my internet connection would cause it to stop rendering a locally served page properlyp

Negative 63153 pI have got quite a complex project on the go at the moment, and as part of this I have a MEF layer which purely handles loading of plugins and then the newly loaded plugins expose their routes which are registered with asp.mvc and their controllers which are added to Ninjects bindings.p  pThe problem however comes in when the dynamically added routes are hit and they are hit, I have checked with route debugger even with correctly added Namespaces for the plugin within the route. When I say I have added the namespaces I mean like belowp  precodevar namespaces  new []  MyPlugin.Controllers  routeCollection.MapRoute                     PluginRoute, pluginaction,                     new  controller  Plugin, action  Default ,                     namespaces codepre  pJust to give a little more context to this situation, I am inheriting from NinjectHttpApplication and not doing anything else, no custom controller factories, no custom dependency resolvers, just what Ninject gives me. Then I take the currently active Kernel, give it to the plugins and they register themselves.p  pNow the routes that are hit do not work, I just get a 404 for any external routes, even though they are hit and the controller is yes tripple checked registered with the Ninject Kernel. So I am thinking that although Ninject has the type registered, Mvcs DefaultControllerFactory cannot find the type when calling through top  precodeGetControllerTypeWithinNamespacesstring controllerName, HashSetltstringgt namespaces codepre  pOne thing that baffles me at the moment though, is that it is not finding it even with the correct namespace... HOWEVER just to prove my hypothisis, if I add the plugin as a reference within the asp mvc project and run it without changing any code, just the plugin assembly is a reference within the project, so it will end up within the bin directory it will work. Hits the route and I get the desired output...p  pSo at this point I am wondering if although MEF is hosting the external DLLs, it is not sharing it in some way with the current AppDomain or something... which seems odd...p  pThis is a blocker for me at the moment, so any advice would be greatp

But with NoSQL like mongodb that just seem wrong to me, if Im not mistaken it creates a new collection and puts in each document an user field used to link the document to the document in the User collection  exactly like a foreign key . That doesnt seem to be a NoSQL way at all  Well Its just my feeling but since Im just a beginner I may be wrong, dont hesitate to correct me . Is there a recommended way to add fields directly to the User model p  p3 When the Model is used in Django, it puts all the fields in the document even if they are empty right  Isnt that a waste of space to write down a lot of fields names in documents if they are empty p  p4 This question is more about Mongodb itself than the engine but Ill ask it anyway, you may have the answer  How much extra space does it take to index a field in a collection p  pDidnt think I would have written so much, I hope some of you had the courage to read me p  pThanks in advance,p  pNolhian p
Negative 63153 pOk, Ive been searching for a while and just cant seem to find the answer, so Im hoping someone can point me straight here...p  pI have gVim 7.3 for windows installed and am trying to run it from the powershell prompt v2.0Win 7amd64.  Vim starts fine, but the colors are all jacked.  Normally I use the desert theme for gVim.  For POSIX shells I usually use CSApprox.vim plugin to get the gVim colors in vim and it works great all i have set in the .vimrc is the set tCo256 for it.  Anyway, Ive tried vim with and with out the 256 and CSApprox plugin, but still get the wrong colors when launched from powershell and cmd, but lets stick with powershell for simplicity here.  How can I get powershell vim to look like gVim desert without permanately changing the powershell colors outside of Vimp

Negative 63153 pIm developing an intranet site that uses asp.net menu tag, and on hovering over a specific link, the submenu pops up.  p  pThe one thing we have to include is support for iPhone and iPad.  The site for the iPhone is going to be completely different, so this will not be an issue.  However, on the iPad, there are no significant changes to the site itself from that of a desktop  laptop user.  p  pThe problem I was having was that after upgrading to iOS 5 was that the built in onMouseOver event from the asp menu isnt firing meaning that when I would tap the menu item once, it would act like I had tapped it twice.  In iOS 4. the control would work fine tap once to get the list of menu items and then tap again to follow a link.  p  pIve implemented a workaround suggested by a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comQuestions278315aspnet40menucontrolandiPaddisplayPrint relnofollow titlethis articlethis Code Project posta, implementing a mouseover event that calls a null javascript function.   p  pA small Markup to illustrate the problem p  precodeltaspMenu runatserver IDMenu1  Any other control additions here gt   ltItemsgt      ltaspMenuItem TextMenuItem1 ValueMenuItem1 gt      ltaspMenuItem TextMenuItem2 ValueMenuItem2 gt   ltItemsgt ltaspMenugt codepre  pAnd how I implemented the fix p  precodeMenuItem mnuitm  new MenuItem mnuitm.Text  ADMIN mnuitm.Value   mnuitm.NavigateUrl  javascriptfunction codepre  pAlso Sorry if there is a similar question, I couldnt find it. p  pstrongEditstrongp  pAfter doing a bit of testing on this, Ive found that this will only work if the original menu item is not intended to actually go anywhere.  However, thats not necessarily always the case.  So this is actually a bigger problem than I thought.  p  pI changed the now not so simple workaround to encompass this situation by using the MenuItemClick event, ViewState and checking the UserAgent maybe not the most elegant solution, but it fits my needs p  precodestring ItemNavUrl  Menu1.SelectedItem.NavigateUrl string ItemName  Menu1.SelectedItem.Text  Check the ViewState first, just in case another menu item was clicked.   if ViewState[MenuItemNav]  null ampamp Menu1.SelectedItem.NavigateUrl   ampamp ViewState[MenuItemName]  null ampamp stringViewState[MenuItemName]  Menu1.SelectedItem.Text      Menu1.SelectedItem.NavigateUrl  stringViewState[MenuItemNav]  Check to see if 1.

If the device is an iPad  else ifMenu1.SelectedItem.ChildItems.Count gt 0 ampamp Menu1.SelectedItem.NavigateUrl   ampamp Request.UserAgent.IndexOfiPad gt 1      Set the URL to nothing and save the values for later.    Menu1.SelectedItem.NavigateUrl      ViewState.AddMenuItemNav, ItemNavUrl    ViewState.AddMenuItemName, ItemName      codepre  pThis is even less elegant than the previous solution although more encompassing, although to be fair, I havent thrown nearly as much testing into it as Id like.p  pSo I have a few questions here.

At least, when I pause Visual Studio and go over the Locals by hovering the mouse over a variable, I see the data as I expect.p  pAs an experiment, Ive added 2 extra variables to the standard Binomial Node.

Its supposed to represent the same node, but as we can see, the value of xpoint is different.

Negative 63153 pI am trying to use Eclipse with an existing codebase. This code has the Makefile buried several directories deep from the root of the project sources. If I tell eclipse this buried directory is the root of the project, everything builds, but nothing indexes, since Eclipse does not know where the sources are.p  pIf I tell Eclipse to use the root of the sources, then I have not been able to make Eclipse use the buried makefile.p  pI have read the other answers to the Eclipse makefile questions, but I still have a problem getting Eclipse to work perfectly  I have also tried a custom Builder schell script that uses the buried Makefile but no luck.p  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 63153 pI am working in a web company and we are going to make an AB test on one of the the main web pages that will test 2 different designs. The AB is going to examine 2 different design approaches different icons, colors, scheme, etc and even slightly minor changes in the layout. the main changes are DESIGN and I will change them in CSS.p  pAssuming I know how to run AB test p  pstrongmy question is how do I handle the CSS files.strongp  pmy main CSS is in a file called codegeneralStyles.css.code p  pDo I nee to create a file that is called codegeneralStylesB.csscode  Will it be a strongduplicationstrong of codegeneralStyles.csscode or will it be in strongadditionstrong to that file and just run over the CSS rules that I am changingp  pDuplicate will make it easy to use generalStylesB if we decide to go gor the B option. but to maintain the code easily duplication seems to be wrong.p  pthanks, Alonp

Negative 63153 pIm inserting an image into my canvas with thisp  pctx.drawImagemyImageObject, 0, 0p  pit works perfectly, except the image I insert has some parts of it as transparent and canvas seems to ignore this and it just prints what should be transparent as white pixels.p  pHere is the image I am inserting a hrefhttpi44.tinypic.com25ymq.gif relnofollowhttpi44.tinypic.com25ymq.gifap  pI researched this problem abit and some people fixed it by doing ctx.getImageData0, 0, width, height.data and then iterating through that array replacing pixels manually for transparency. I also read that this is bad practise because its slow and my sprite sheets could be 1000 x 1000 and so this WOULD be very slow.p  pIs it possible to do something to make the transparency in my gif show up When I saved it in photoshop and when I look at the gif itself I can see the transparency, but as soon as I stick it in a canvas it stops being transparent.p  pstrongeditstrong I just tried another gif and the transparency works, but in the one above it does not, could there possibly be a problem with the above gifp

Negative 63153 pIm totally baffled by a recent problem Im encountering.  Ive moved the MySQL database of a WordPress site from one server to another.  After this, my client reports that they cannot access their site from their offices, but can access it anywhere else.p  pIve told them to clear cache, history, cookies, etc.  No luck.  Site just doesnt work in their office and works fine when they are anywhere else. They continue to receive timeout errors.p  pSite is visible to me on any browser, logged in, or logged out.p  pCould this be related to the database move  Is this is an unrelated issue that just happened to coincide with this database movep  pYour help would be appreciated as Im dumbfounded.p

Negative 63153 pI am writing an application which grabs an XML file from the server and then works with the data inside. My question is, because TCP ensures that all packets arrive and is beyond my control to control how it breaks that data apart, does it make sense to cap the buffer size If so, I can send the data over in chunks and reassemble them on the client side. Obviously I cannot make an infinite buffer. The XML can get fairly large, up to 256kb and I am bit worried about reserving a buffer of that size. The data is pulled by an Android device but we can assume the device have 1gb of RAM.p

Negative 63153 pIm trying to recursively reapply codeCSSStyleDeclarationcode objects to each node in my documents innerHTML. For example, if you call codewindow.getComputedStyledocument.getElementsByTagNamea[0]code on this page, there are about 650 different properties in the hash that gets returned. Lets say I had 1000 nodes in my documents innerHTML. As I loop through the innerHTML and apply the styles in each codeCSSStyleDeclarationcode hash, that is 650,000 calls to codenode.style.setPropertykey, valuecode. However, by iterating through a loop, Im doing each node one by one. Instead, it would be far more efficient to make 1000 calls to the DOM at once instead of doing this loop. Thing is, if this is possible in Chrome, I dont know how. p  pMy suspicion is that Chrome has a GIL for lack of a better word on the entire DOM, but this may just be superstition. If not that, Id assume the lock is on a node level. But again, total superstition. Im operating in a factless environment on this one. If you have any pointers, Id greatly appreciate it.p

Negative 63153 pThere are many threads on SO about interrupting reading the system.in but what I am looking for here is some kind of advice as to how to best code what I am trying to achieve.p  pI have a getlogin method that needs to do the following ask a user to input the desired login environnement details, if after 6 seconds user have not input a valid value live or test then set userlogin variable to test and return it to the caller.p  pI have taken the following approach for the getlogin implementationp  p1  launch two threads which do the following   thread1 creates a scanner object then calls scanner.nextline and depending on user input set a variable userlogin. Interrupts thread2 before exiting thread1.   thread2 waits 6 seconds and if after that userlogin is still not set, then set a default value for userlogin. Interrupts thread1 before exiting thread2.p  p2  join thread2 to stop main thread from returning a null userloginp  p3  return userloginp  pThe problem I have with the approach is that scanner.nextline does not interrupt when thread2 calls thread1.interrupt, which is why I do not join thread1 in step 2 as the main thread would hang. Is there a way to get thread1 to complete after thread2 interrupts it  Or else is this approach completely overkill and there is a much simpler way to achieve the contractp
Negative 63153 pweve been having this problem for a long time and still cannot find out where is the problem. Our application uses RTMP for videostreaming and if the webclient cannot connect it skips to RTMPT RTMP over HTTP. This causes the video to freeze after couple seconds of playback.p  pI have already found some forums where people seems to be havoing the same issue, but none of the proposed solutions worked. One suggestion was to turn of the video recording, but it didnt work. I have also read, that it seems to be a thread problem in the red5, but before hacking into the RED5 I would like to know, if maybe somebody has a patch or anything which repairs this.p  pOne thing more, weve been testing this on Macs if that should count. Thank you very much in advance.p

Negative 63153 pIm working on setting new tab orders for multiple Panels accross an application. I want to create a new class that will allow me to handle to sorting much in the same way as the deprecated setNextFocusableComponent method would. Im creating a class that extends the DefaultTreversalPolicyClass and overloads the getComponentBefore and getComponentAfter methods. On the panels themselves I want the implementation to be as simple as creating a new custom class Ill call it CustomizedTabOrderPolicy and then adding the components for which I want to specify the the tab order. I do this via a convenience method on the CustomizedTabOrderPolicy class which allows me to add the components for which I want to specify tab order link to a Hashtable, I then create a copy of the hastable in which the key and value are switched.

Negative 63153 pI have a question with regard to the sleep function declared in unistd.hp  pAssume we use a CFS scheduler.p  pWe have a process that is ready to runlets call this READY state,it gets picked to run,and now is runningso called RUNNING state.p  pDuring its execution in the RUNNING state it encounters a sleep statement,say sleep10 that makes it sleep for 10 seconds or until a signal gets delivered or whichever is sooner. p  pNow when sleep10 is being executed,is the process in READY state or is it put back into its original priority in the RUNNING queue or is it put to the WAIT queue.p  pI am unable to visualize the correct sequence of events.One thought process suggests that it remains in the READY queue,while another thought is that its put to the WAIT queue waiting for a timer expiry of some sorts.p  pPlease let me know how this would work,or if there is something wrong in my question.

Negative 63153 pI am designing a SaaS application and have been directed to Backbone.js.

Negative 63153 pSo, I was wondering if there was a clever way to handle adding a column to a MySQL table that contains a large amount of data. If I were to go the standard migration route, it would take roughly 6 hours. I wonder if there is a better solution for this. p  pOne way weve avoided the long migration is create a new tablemodel and set up a delegationtype relationship in ActiveRecord. While this works nicely, it seems a bit wrong.p  pShould I just buck up and do the super long migration p

Negative 63153 pI have subclassed and am using UIPopoverBackgroundView in order to make custom appearances for my UIPopoverControllers.  Everything seems to work great so far, the popover draws well and looks the way I expect it.br The issue is that, when my popover is left open for a period of time with no activity, the border will often suddenly be drawn wrong.  This specifically seems to only happen when the popover contains a scrollviewtableview which is larger than the popover i.e. it is scrollable.  It also doesnt happen every time, but if it does happen, it occurs in less than one minute of inactivity.  If I take a screenshot, the issue is not visible despite it clearly being seen on screen so I cant provide any images of the issue unfortunately.p  pDoes anyone know of any reason why the border would be drawn incorrectly after several seconds of inactivity and how to fix the issue  I can provide snippets of code if necessary, though Im fairly certain everything is right and equivalent to the many examples Ive seen online.  I also do not resize the popover at any time during the inactivity I do resize when initially displayed to fit the content up to a maximum size.p  pSince I cant take a screenshot to demonstrate the issue, the best I can do is describe it.  It appears as if the border in certain areas is drawn at the wrong size as in, part of the right edge is being drawn in the middle of the popover NOT that the border itself is too wide, but rather that the area the border should be bordering is wrong.  The area along the actual edge is still there, but is lacking its layer effects I have the backgroundView using a border and rounded corner layer effect to give it a nice rounded white edge, emulating the same appearance as the default background view, just a different color.  Removing the layer effects does not prevent the issue though.  Sometimes its only a part of the right edge which is drawn incorrectly, sometimes part of the bottom edge is also affected.  I cant seem to find any correlation as to when or how this happens though it is frequent, nor to which edge is affected though Ive never seen it affect the top or left edge.p

Negative 63153 pI am currently working on a project that requires a dynamic filter option.  This would be a combobox, used to determine the filter type, and a textbox, used to get the search key.  What I am wanting to do is make this as dynamic as possible.  I dont want to have to come back into the source code and change it if the customer decides they want a new one on the fly.p  pThe data is currently spread across two databases, I have no say in this.  This has discouraged the use of Entity Framework and Dynamic LINQ.  The current idea I have is to bind the combobox to filters that are stored in the database with the TSQL to execute to get the results and use spexecutesql to get them back, which can be seen a hrefhttpsqlfiddle.com3c2cd61 relnofollowherea.p  pI would like some other recommendations on how I can accomplish this.

Negative 63153 pIn Python 2.7 I can successfully convert the Unicode string codeabcudc34xyzcode to UTF8 result is codeabcxedxb0xb4xyzcode. But when I pass the UTF8 string to eg. codepangoparsemarkupcode or codegconvertwithfallbackcode, I get errors like Invalid byte sequence in conversion input. Apparently the GTKPango functions detect the unpaired surrogate in the string and correctly reject it.p  pPython 3 doesnt even allow conversion of the Unicode string to UTF8 error utf8 codec cant encode character udc34 in position 3 surrogates not allowed, but I can run codeabcudc34xyz.encodeutf8, replacecode to get a valid UTF8 string with the lone surrogate replaced by some other character. Thats fine for me, but I need a solution for Python 2.p  pSo the question is in Python 2.7, how can I convert that Unicode string to UTF8 while replacing the lone surrogate with some replacement character like UFFFD Preferably only standard Python functions and GTKGLibG... functions should be used.p  pBtw. Iconv can convert the string to UTF8 but simply removes the bad character instead of replacing it with UFFFD.p

Negative 63153 pSo, Im converting some of my comboboxes to editable comboboxes because the customer wants to freely enter in new entries.

Negative 63153 pI have a codeJTextPanecode whose model is a codeDefaultStyledDocumentcode.  Im noticing that if the text is displayed, and I then use codesetCharacterAttributescode to change every character on a line to a much larger font, the font of the characters on that line is changed in the display as I expect, but the lines below it dont move, so that the lines overlap in the display.p  pIs there a way to force the codeJTextPanecode to recompute the text locations and redisplay itself or a portion of itself  I tried setting up a codeDocumentListenercode with codechangedUpdatecode, and codechangedUpdatecode is indeed called, but I cant find a way to make it redraw the codeJTextPanecode.  coderevalidatecode didnt work. p  pbEDITb The lines do shift by themselves with a smaller test case, so apparently something else Im doing in the program is interfering, but I havent figured out what.

One solution is to add the line codeheaderXXSSProtection 0code to wpblogheader.php in the root folder.  This is insecure as it switches off the XSS protection on your WordPress site but it does allow the bookmarklet code to be rendered when the page loads.p  pAre there any real solutions to this problem that dont involve switching off XSS protection Is there a perhaps a plugin I can install to my WordPress to allow me to add codejavascriptcode links inside my posts p

Negative 63153 pMy program takes in thousands of PLSQL functions, procedures and views, saves them as objects and then adds them to an array list.

The older object would be removed based on its dateLastModified variable. The approach i took was to have an outer loop and an inner loop with each object comparing themselves to every other object and then changing the name to remove if it was considered to be older. The program then does one final pass backwards through the arraylist removing any objects whose name is set as remove.

Negative 63153 pIm trying to benchmark Xenomai, PreemptRT and Linux asis in a Raspberry Pi, and Im having some trouble.p  pIm trying to create a variable number of threads, with RT priority, and a variable sleep time. One of the threads has higher RT priority, and reads from a GPIO, and writes to another GPIO to read the latency on an oscyloscope or something like this, and the other threads, with lower RT priority, only do arithmetic operations.

Negative 63153 pI am actually looking for some help on learning the ropes on designing multiple Repositories that will access the same database using EF. I have seen sample code where each repository has its own private DBContext, but am having difficulty with this concept. I am not interested in a Generic Interface in this project and I want multiple interfaces that are based on authorization andor specific job tasks. Maybe a better question would be how should I design my DAL when I want a single application to serve purposes for many job tasks and users.   I was also wondering what a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers70386jgauffinjgauffina meant by,  strong make sure that your repository is 100 complete abstractionstrongp  pWhat is meant by this Also here is an example of what I am trying to figure out. Is this practice reasonablep  precodepublic class OneRepo IRepository, IDisposable   private DbContext context  new DbContext   Methods and whatnot...    codepre  pAnd then a second repository also requires the same db connection by OneRepo but has separate inmemory Unit of Work I thinkp  precodepublic class AnotherRepo IRepository, IDisposable   private DbContext context  new DbContext   Methods and whatnot...       codepre  pI apologize if my question is not wellwritten. I am relatively new to actually posting and I am not sure if I am making myself clear.

Any help explaining would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 63153 pSo what I am trying to accomplish is what most Hotel or Airport sites have in general, after youve chosen a date for your arrival when clicking on the next calendar it automatically updates the calendar dates to the same month in which you chose your arrival.p  pSee a hrefhttphotelsaxchicago.com relnofollowhttphotelsaxchicago.comap  pI currently have jQuery UI and its calendar plugin for a casinohotel site a hrefhttpstaging.comanchenationcasinos.com relnofollowhttpstaging.comanchenationcasinos.comap  pIs there away to do something similar on here How can I detect whats already in the input field without actually clicking the submit button.p  pAt the same time, how can I trigger the calendar if someone clicks on the icon insteadp  pThanks ahead of time.p
Negative 63153 pIm working on sport club database design and I have a problem with loops there. First Id like to show you my diagram Im sorry i dont have professional for design in this place. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBm7Mq.png altenter image description herep  pI know that doing such loops should be avoided, but if there a reason for each of them For example  I have four tables  players, teams, games and participants. There are always two teams in each game  my team and opponents. So I need to add foreign key teamid to the game table. Next I have players, each player is currently playing in specific team co there is [many  one] relation between these two tables. And I want to keep somewhere stats about this player in this game  participants table. What more  I need to keep info about some of my players in transfers table, so there is another loop. But can I keep that designp
Negative 63153 pIve started writing a library for ndimensional vectors.p  pTheres a couple of design features that I would like to support in this libraryp  ul liThe memory layout is continuous. This is so that sharing memory, sending over a network, and saving to file is only a matter of passing a pointer.li liDifferent dimensions can support different element sizes ie code[0][0]code may be code1code byte while code[1][0]code may be code2code bytes.li ul  pAfter drawing out some representations of what the memory layout would look like for vectors of certain dimensions, Ive realized that there is two ways to layout the structurep  pHeres the first way.

My solution was to declare codepositionrelativecode and set negative codemargincode values roughly equal to 50 of the elements width, but the closest Ive been able to come is to half the elements percentage of its parents widthp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt  ltheadgt   ltstylegt   .clap     positionrelative    marginauto 16.66  This elements share of the entire parents width  33.33    colorf00      ltstylegt  ltheadgt  ltbodygt   ltcentergt    ltspan styledisplayinlineblockgt1234567890ltspan classclapgt1234567890ltspangt1234567890ltspangt   ltcentergt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pIm trying to find a CSSonly solution that will use the width of the element itself, not the width of the container. I cant use JavaScript to do this because I plan to use it as a MathJaX fix by embedding it in a codestylecode command. As far as I know, MathJaX does not provide for embedded HTML or JavaScript code within its formulas, so you see why this must be CSSonly. I know its possible with scripting. Is it possible with CSS, or is my endeavor hopelessp  pemUpdate Thanks to a suggestion from Daiwei, I think Im on the road to the right solution. Thanks for all your answers. Here is the revised codeemp  precode.clap   positionabsolute  displayinlineblock  transform translate50,0  colorf00                       for contrast   codepre  pemId love to show you the results, but I cant upload a picture. Sorry.emp  pemAnother update The solution I presented above works best in an HTMLCSS context, but it breaks in a MathJaX codearraycode, codematrixcode, or similar tabular environment. Specifically, if the element is too long, it clips on the left side. Relative positioning moves the element halfway to the left but leaves a gaping space where it used to be Any ideas for patching it upemp

During this time or the splash screen, I would like to display a progress bar to show the user work is being done. Then kill the splash activity and launch my main activity.  I have a splash screen made with a progress bar calling a async function that only is working with the sleep function as a place holder for the progress bar to show information. It then takes a few seconds after its completed to launch the main activity. strongThe question is how do I load the activity and show the progress of it with the horizontal progress bar in the splash activitystrong Ive tried to fully understand the activity life cycle. I understand the codeonCreatecode method creates the activity and then once its finished then calls codeonStartcode automatically.  But as stated before I want to just load the activity then start it manually.p

Negative 63153 pI have an old VB6 program that does numerical integrations with help of a C DLL, also compiled in VS6. Yes, I know I should update the code to .NET etc, but it just works.  Recently, I tried some more complex calculations than usual and noticed that the program runs faster when the mouse is moving in the main form.  That is, when given a particular large problem to integrate, the executionintegration takes about 5 seconds if the mouse is left motionless after clicking the command button, but it finishes in about 1 second if the mouse is moved around without clicking on the form.  Since the program also does optimizations of parameters to fit data, this makes a huge difference in the total time to do a fit.p  pI did some work to narrow down the source of the effect.  Mouse movement does increase the CPU clock frequency from 1600 MHz to 2600 Mhz, but this does not seem to be enough to give such a large increase on a single thread. In debugging, I found the integration routine executes the preliminary VB code up to the DLL call with no delay, and most of the calculation time is spent in the DLL function after passing the variables. Debugging in the DLL shows that most of the extra time is spent in the repetitive loops of the numerical routine, but there is no obvious reason the mouse movement would speed these up.p  pIs this just an effect of speeding up the CPU clock frequency, despite the huge reduction in execution time  Or is there an alternative explanation p
Negative 63153 pIm working with Websphere 7 and Websphere MQ 7 I have a message driven bean MDB deployed in Websphere which is bound to a WebSphere MQ Activation Specification configured queue.  The MDB will be receiving messages in EDCIDIC format and need to convert this  into ASCII. In the past, directly connecting to the MQ server using native MQ API we had the option to programmatically  convert the message using i.e.  the following excerptp  precodegmo.options  MQC.MQGMOCONVERT Handles EBCDICASCII getq  qmgr.accessQueueresponseQueue whiletrue      MQMessage msgId  new MQMessage     msgId.characterSet  1208     getq.getmsgId, gmo  codepre  pBut using MDBs JMS  there doesnt seem to be an option to instruct the conversion. I suspect Websphere should have a setting to do the conversion as it acts as a bridge between  MQ server and the MDB but cant seem to find a setting in the console.p  pAny ideas please p

Negative 63153 pI just noticed a whole bunch of typos in a compiled LaTeX document typed in emacs, stemming from me not noticing that when I pasted in some text from elsewhere, I accrued a lot of ligatures like  instead of fi.  Ive done a search and replace to fix this particular instance, but it would be nice to be confident there werent more of these.  Is there anything more wholesale I could do in emacs to find all such fixesp

Negative 63153 pHello everyone, first post here. So its going into the weekend and I dont have access to my course instructor. This is our first project using linked lists and Im mangling it pretty good. The fault is, Im pretty sure, on line 53 of sllist.cpp codeoutput ltlt temp gt contentscode This is meant to access the contents of the node, in this case an int, and store it in a stringstream variable so that I can output the whole thing later. Clearly Im not doing it right. Ive been trying to fix it for the better part of a day and a half but I just dont know what Im doing wrong. All of the files beginning with sl are mine, the exercise18.cpp is testing code created by my instructor. If I comment out the offending function my code compiles and runs as expected. Can anyone here tell me what Ive screwed up Its probably something pretty easily spotted.

Negative 63153 pIn perl, DBI module is the standard way of interacting with DBs, where each DB vendor provides its own DBD module which is used by the DBI. Its somewhat similar to JDBC. I cant figure out if a similar model exists in python. In case of Postgres, I see there are pg and pgdb modules, where pgdb follows DBAPI 2.0 and pg doesnt.

Negative 63153 pI need to invoke XSLT 2.0 transformations from a legacy VB6 application. I had a very good previous experience with the command line version of Saxon, so I decided to give the Saxons .NET version a try. This is my first serious experience with COM.NET interoperation mechanism and, unfortunately, all my quick attempts to make Saxon .NET available to my VB6 application have failed depending on the versions of Saxon and .NET that I tried, the Saxon API classes either dont seem to work or dont even show up in Object Browser. p  pI would really appreciate it if any of you would share your successful experience with using Saxon .NET from a VB6VBA6 application or any other COM application. It would be great to know which specific versions of Saxon and .NET had worked for you, which specific Saxon assemblies had to be registered for COM.NET interop. A simple VB6 code example of transformation with a parameter would be a great icing on this cake. p  pThank youp

I find it difficult to put it into words but i think this small diagram helps describe the problemp  precodeSTART A   xy B   xy C             xy D           xy E                         xy F                                    xy                                                 End codepre  pHere option E would fail because its start date is after Ds end date, I use a while loop to add a day to the gap for everyday the start date is after the end date, this would trigger the validation, even though those dates have been covered by entry A.I am using Java to do this but even help in text and pseudo code would be great as it is more the logic im lost with , p  pIf anyone could help with the gaps between dates I would be very grateful.p

Both with date codehostapiproductsalldeviceid07082014code and without date codehostapiusersalldeviceidcode..p  pDoes anyone know what is wrong with my MapHttpRoutes and how I should change itp  hr  pEDIT 1p  pIve changed the date constraints to codedate  d2d2d4  ddMMyyyy code like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25199949csharpwebapiconfigmaphttprouteswithactionandoptionaldatetimestringan2520053625200536Yevgeniy.Chernobrivets suggesteda. Ive also tried his other suggestion of removing the codeconstraints new  id  [09] code from the top MapHttpRoute. When I do this my requests like codehostapiusersalldeviceidcode are working again, but the ones with the date like codehostapiordersalldeviceid07082014code are giving me the following errorp  precodeid1,MessageNo HTTP resource was found that matches the request URI httplocalhostmyportapiordersallgivendeviceid07082014., MessageDetailNo action was found on the controller Orders that matches the request. codepre  hr  pEDIT 2p  pIve also tried a single MapHttpRoute like sop  precodeconfig.Routes.MapHttpRoute     name WebApiRoute,     routeTemplate apicontrolleractiondeviceidallidoneid,     defaults new  allid  RouteParameter.Optional, oneid  RouteParameter.Optional ,     constraints new  allid  d2d2d4[09], oneid  [09]   codepre  pWith the same calls as before, but with the parameter names changed The ones using date [Products, Categories, Orders] have codedatecode changed to codeallidcode and codeidcode changed to codeoneidcode.

PS I know Im pretty bad at regex and MapHttpRoutes, so does anyone know a complete solution so all my HttpGets and HttpPosts are working, of all APIControllersp  hr  pEDIT 3p  pThere seems to be something wrong with the constraints.. It almost looks like when constraints are added in the MapHttpRoute, the codeRouteParamter.Optionalcode is ignored.. I probably did something wrong though, but cant figure out what. I tried adding a MapHttpRoute before my original MapHttpRoute, this time without constraints like sop  precodeconfig.Routes.MapHttpRoute     name WebApiRoute,     routeTemplate apicontrolleractiondeviceidallidoneid,     defaults new  allid  RouteParameter.Optional, oneid  RouteParameter.Optional ,     constraints new  allid  d2d2d4[09], oneid  [09]   config.Routes.MapHttpRoute     name DefaultApiRoute,     routeTemplate apicontrolleractiondeviceidid,     defaults new  id  RouteParameter.Optional   codepre  pNow almost everything is workingp  precodehostapiproductsalldeviceid07082014   works hostapiproductsonedeviceid070820145   works hostapiusersalldeviceid   works hostapiusersonedeviceid5   doesnt work gives same result as usersalldeviceid hostapiusersonedeviceidbla5   works but shouldnt work..  Havent tested the HttpPOSTs yet codepre  pStill, would prefer it if I could add constraints..p  pBut even with my old code before date was ever applied, constraints doesnt work when I add themp  precodeconfig.Routes.MapHttpRoute     name DefaultApiRoute,     routeTemplate apicontrolleractiondeviceidid,     defaults new  id  RouteParameter.Optional ,     constraints new  id  [09]   codepre  pWithout the constraints this worksp  precodehostapiusersalldeviceid   works hostapiusersalldeviceid5   works codepre  pWith the constraints this doesnt work..p  precodehostapiusersalldeviceid   doesnt work error Server Error in  Application.

S And Im still no where near a working solution after all these trial and errors I did..p  hr  pEdit 4p  pAfter another a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25199949csharpwebapiconfigmaphttprouteswithactionandoptionaldatetimestringannoredirect1comment3931580425199949suggestion of Yevgeniy.Chernobrivetsa I tried to separate All and Onep  precodeconfig.Routes.MapHttpRoute     name ApiAll,     routeTemplate apicontrolleralldeviceiddate,     defaults new  date  RouteParameter.Optional ,     constraints new  date  d2d2d4, httpMethod  new HttpMethodConstraintHttpMethod.Get   config.Routes.MapHttpRoute     name ApiOne,     routeTemplate apicontrolleronedeviceididdate,     defaults new  date  RouteParameter.Optional ,     constraints new  date  d2d2d4, id  d, httpMethod  new HttpMethodConstraintHttpMethod.Get   config.Routes.MapHttpRoute     name ApiGet,     routeTemplate apicontrolleractiondeviceid,     defaults null,     constraints new  httpMethod  new HttpMethodConstraintHttpMethod.Get   config.Routes.MapHttpRoute     name ApiPost,     routeTemplate apicontrolleractiondeviceid,     defaults null,     constraints new  httpMethod  new HttpMethodConstraintHttpMethod.Post   codepre  pAnd added code[HttpGet]code to all my GetOne and GetAll methods.p  pWith the following resultsp  precodehostapiproductsalldeviceid07082014   works hostapiproductsonedeviceid507082014   works NOTE date and id are switched now, but I dont mind this hostapiusersalldeviceid   works hostapiusersonedeviceid5   doesnt work Server Error in  Application. The resource cannot be found. hostapiusersonedeviceid500000000   works but I want it to work without the date as well.. hostapitestenabledeviceid  works  Havent tested the HttpPOSTs yet codepre  pSo, now almost everything works, except for codehostapiusersonedeviceididcode and also with tags instead of users. It looks like the codedefaults new  date  RouteParameter.Optional ,code isnt working in the second and first MapHttpRoute.p  pIf I cant find any solution I just stick with this one and just provide code00000000code when I want a single UserTag.. . I have a deadline and it already took me way, way longer than expected to simply add the date to the URLRoute..p  pEDIT 4bp  pIf I remove the code[ActionNameone]code and code[ActionNameall]code from my methods, it seems that codehostapiusersalldeviceidcode isnt working either codeNo action all was found on the controller Users that matches the request.code, so that means when I keep the ActionNames it uses the third MapHttpRoute instead of the first for the GetAllUsersmethod.. The codedate  RouteParameter.Optionalcode isnt working at all when I provide a constraint for it.. p

Negative 63153 pAs far as I can tell, the only reason you might use an array of pointers is to preserve ordering, as a PFRelation instance does not support ordering.

Negative 63153 pI wrote a small jQuery code that will display a dialog box if the page is not refreshed for 1800 seconds. The dialog has a countdown before the session automatically ends. If the user click Yes, Keep working then the counter resets and the dialog disappears. Otherwise the user is transferred to the logout page.p  pThe issue that I am having here is when a user opens a new browsers tab and continue working on the new tab. Then the old tab will become idle after 1800 seconds with no refresh so they loose all their sessions and get logged out.p  pI have created a PHP page that will return how many seconds remaining by checking the time in the database using codeSESSIONcode information.

Negative 63153 pI have a VERY LARGE table with a timestamp and a value V. Some of the Vs might be nullp  precodetimestamp,V sometime1,value1 sometime2,value2 sometime3,NULL sometime4,value4 codepre  pI want a query to select the value V of a given timestamp T, but if it is NULL, get me the value at the time closest to T on either side of T. For example, if I havep  precode20100901 000001,v1 20100901 000002,v2 20100901 000003,NULL 20100901 000004,NULL 20100901 000005,v3 codepre  pI want the query for timestamp 3 to return v2 because 2 is closer to 3 than 5, but would want the query for timestamp 4 to return v3 because 5 is closer. p  pemTimeem is not guaranteed to be contiguous either, e.g., we may havep  precode20100901 000001,v1 20100901 000004,v2 20100901 000030,NULL 20100901 000042,NULL 20100901 000050,v3 codepre  pIn which case v3 is closest to both 30 and 42. p  pCurrently, Im doing this by connecting Python to SQL and starting a for loop in both directions from the timestamp in question, and returning the closest value that does not return NULL. But if I can do this in SQL, it would be much cleaner. I cannot write a stored procedure this has to be a single query. p  pI am doing this because I need the closest temporally valid value for a given timestamp, but sometimes the value is NULL for the timestamp.  p

Negative 63153 pI have a void method that does something.  I do not care what it does in my unit test class.  However, it is throwing exception when I call it from my unittest class and it is causing my test cases to fail.  p  pHow can I, using EasyMock, mock this object so that when this void method gets called, I ignore what it does in my unit testp  pFor example, lets say the object is called codemyObjectcode and it has a void method called codedoSomethingcode. EasyMock doesnt let me use expect because it is a void method that returns nothing.  But when I call this method in my test case, it throws an exception which I want to completely ignore.p  pI know this can be achieved by maybe using mockito or other libs, but Id like to use EasyMock.p  pemUPDATEemp  pthe method in question is a private void method which gets called by other processes. i cannot call it directly but i still want to ignore the exception thats thrown by that private void method.p  pive tried using nice mock as suggested as below.p  precodeMyObject obj  EasyMock.createNiceMockMyObject.class EasyMock.replayobj codepre  pand then i set this obj in another object that contains it as private variable.p  precodeMyObject2 obj2  new MyObject2 obj2.setMyObjectobj codepre  pand i call some method that calls the private void method internally.p  precodeobj2.methodThatCallsPrivateVoidMethod codepre  pand this did not work.p

Negative 63153 pI have 99,999 bit flags that I need to represent uniquely with 32 bits or less. Any of the bits can be set and I need to know if the set bits differ from a comparable set of bits. I am considering using CRC to store a unique value hash but I am not sure if collisions will be a problem. Ideally, less than 500 of these bits will be set at any given time, but they will not be know ahead of time.p  pIs there suitable hash or other algorithm to uniquely represent these bitsp
Negative 63153 pFrom what I have learned, there is a difference between a function and a procedure. I know that a function returns a value whereas a procedure just executes commands one after the other. Today on the other hand, my professor stated that we can also use a procedure to return a value in a C program. Im pretty sure that it is not possible. I also checked on the internet and read that a procedure just executes a command and a function executes and returns a value. I may be mistaken. If anyone can please tell me if I have the correct understanding , it would be a big help. Thank you p

Negative 63153 pHeres an interesting one, I have a scenario in a bucket sharding system Im writing where I maintain index hashes and storage hashes, the interrelation is a UUID generated because this is distributed and I want some confidence that new buckets gain unique references.p  pEarly on in this exercise I started optimising the code to freeze all keys generated by SecureRandom.uuid it produces strings because when you use a string as a key in a hash gets duped and frozen automatically to ensure that it cant be changed. if its a String and not frozen.p  pIn most cases its easy to aggressively do this, particularly for new UUIDs actually in my project many such values need this treatment but in some cases I find Im having to approach a hash with a value passed over the network and obtain then, to ensure consistent use of any strings present as keys, use a rather obtuse lookup mechanism.p  pMy goal in this, since I want this to maintain a huge data set across multiple nodes, to reduce the overhead of key and index storage as much as possible and because its a bucketing system the same UUID can be referenced many times and as such its helpful to use the same reference.p  pHeres some code that demonstrates the issue in a simplish form. Im just asking if theres a more optimum and convenient mechanism for obtaining any preexisting object reference for a key that has the same string value for the key name and not the value associated.p  precode Demonstrate the issue..  require securerandom  index  Hash.new store  Hash.new  key  meh value  1  uuid  SecureRandom.uuid  puts Ruby dups and freezes strings if used for keys in hashes puts This produces different IDs store[uuid]  value index[key]  uuid store.eachkey  x puts Store reference for value of x x.objectid index.eachvalue  x puts Index reference for x x.objectid  puts  puts If inconsistencies in ID occur then Ruby attempts to preserve the use of the frozen key so if it happens in one area take care puts This produces different IDs uuid  uuid.freeze store[uuid]  value index[key]  uuid store.eachkey  x puts Store reference for value of x x.objectid index.eachvalue  x puts Index reference for x x.objectid  puts  puts If you start with a clean slate and a frozen key you can overcome it if you freeze the string before use puts This is clean so far and produces the same object index  Hash.new store  Hash.new  store[uuid]  value index[key]  uuid store.eachkey  x puts Store reference for value of x x.objectid index.eachvalue  x puts Index reference for x x.objectid  puts  puts But if the same value for the key comes in possibly remote then it becomes awkward puts This produces different IDs uuid  uuid.dup.freeze store[uuid]  value index[key]  uuid store.eachkey  x puts Store reference for value of x x.objectid index.eachvalue  x puts Index reference for x x.objectid  puts  puts So you get into oddities like this to ensure you standarise values put in to keys that already exist puts This cleans up and produces same IDs but is a little awkward  uuid  uuid.dup.freeze uuidlist  store.keys uuid  uuidlist[uuidlist.indexuuid] if uuidlist.includeuuid store[uuid]  value index[key]  uuid store.eachkey  x puts Store reference for value of x x.objectid index.eachvalue  x puts Index reference for x x.objectid  puts codepre  pExample run...p  precodeRuby dups and freezes strings if used for keys in hashes This produces different IDs Store reference for value of bd48a58195e9452eb8a3602d92d47011 70209306325780 Index reference for bd48a58195e9452eb8a3602d92d47011 70209306325880  If inconsistencies in ID occur then Ruby attempts to preserve the use of the frozen key so if it happens in one area take care This produces different IDs Store reference for value of bd48a58195e9452eb8a3602d92d47011 70209306325780 Index reference for bd48a58195e9452eb8a3602d92d47011 70209306325880  If you start with a clean slate and a frozen key you can overcome it if you freeze the string before use This is clean so far and produces the same object Store reference for value of bd48a58195e9452eb8a3602d92d47011 70209306325880 Index reference for bd48a58195e9452eb8a3602d92d47011 70209306325880  But if the same value for the key comes in possibly remote then it becomes awkward This produces different IDs Store reference for value of bd48a58195e9452eb8a3602d92d47011 70209306325880 Index reference for bd48a58195e9452eb8a3602d92d47011 70209306325000  So you get into oddities like this to ensure you standarise values put in to keys that already exist This cleans up and produces same IDs but is a little awkward Store reference for value of bd48a58195e9452eb8a3602d92d47011 70209306325880 Index reference for bd48a58195e9452eb8a3602d92d47011 70209306325880 codepre

Negative 63153 pI just recently came upon web components and I find it awesome. Nevertheless, it is still not implemented in all browsers. For that reason im using webcomponents.js in Safari to be able to use HTML imports. There are several articles and tutorials on how to use the polyfills, but I still find the available documentation lacking. In my case, Im creating a visual style guide and need to be able to reuse certain bits of code many times all over the guide. I believe that HTML imports could help me in achieving my goal, but once I load webcomponents.js I dont know how to proceed. Notice that at this point Im not trying to create my own web components, just use imports to load certain HTML bits into certain locations in my visual guide.p  pThis is an example code Im usingp  precodewindow.addEventListenerHTMLImportsLoaded, function e      use strict      var links,         i,         content      links  document.querySelectorAlllink[relimport]  I have more than one link tag      for i  0 i lt links.length i  1          content  links[i].import         alertcontent This shows null       codepre  pNotice that when debugging I can see that codelinkscode is a list of links and that it has all the expected properties including import, but they are null.p  pThis is how my HTML source looks likep  precodeltdiv idouterdivgt     ltdiv idinnerdivgt         ltheadergt             ltinput idinputfield classtextinput typetextgt             ltspan idmessagespangtYou have notificationsltspangt             ltlabel idsnolabelgtltinput idsnocheck typecheckboxgt New onlyltlabelgt             ltlink relimport hrefmainmenu.htmlgt             ltul idmenugt                 ltli idreloadbuttongtReload Allltligt                 ltli idsettingsbuttongtSettingsltligt             ltulgt         ltheadergt         ltsection idsectionreposgt             lth4gtRepositorieslth4gt             ltlink relimport hrefrepolisting.htmlgt         ltsectiongt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pNotice that there are two codeltlink relimportgtcode tags in use here.

Negative 63153 pI recently completed a project where I used the object hook in Python to detect whether a JSON key was a duplicate of another key. Normal JSON decoders seem to just give the last value encountered, but I would like to be able to detect and return an error. My new project at new company is to write this in golang, so wondering if there is a similar method to Pythons object hook. I had also used a different object hook to get an ordered dict in Python essentially a list form of the JSON input, with the ordering of the original JSON preserved. Havent been tasked with that in golang yet, but I bet its coming.... anyway, input on either of these JSON capabilities as relate to golang appreciatedp

Negative 63153 pSo, I already have a plugin Advanced Product Quantities installed that allows me to set minimum quantities for categories and products. However, what Im trying to do is set a minimum quantity for an overall productcategory rather than a minimum for each of its individual variations. To put this into context, I have a baked goods business where I sell bagels. A customer needs to order a minimum of 12 bagels. They can order however many bagels of each kind that they want for ex 4 poppy seed, 5 plain, 3 onion, etc., so long as they order a minimum of 12 bagels total. p  pWhen I set a category minimum for the bagel category, it makes each product variation in the shopping cart increase its quantity to 12 to fulfill checkout, rather than recognize that they are all a type of bagel and therefore fulfill the overall bagel minimum of 12 bagels. p  pDoes anyone have any ideas on how I can get this minimum quantity concept working for my situationp

Negative 63153 pSome time ago, I asked in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17291965embedtheexistingcodeofamethodinatryfinallyblockEmbed the existing code of a method in a tryfinally blocka how to wrap the body of a method in a tryfinally block using ASM. The solution was to visit a label for the try block at the beginning of the method body in codevisitCodecode and to complete the tryfinally block when visiting an instruction with a return opcode in codevisitInsncode. I was aware that the solution wont be working if a method has no return instruction which applies if the method is always leaving with an exception.p  pThough, I discovered that the former solution is sometimes inappropriate for methods with return instructions, too. It wont be working if a method has more than one return instruction. The reason is that it generates invalid bytecode because one tryfinally block is added at the beginning of the method but more than one tryfinally block is completed.p  pUsually but probably depending on the javac compiler, a bytecode method contains a single return instruction and all return paths end at that instruction by jumping there. However, the compilation of the following code with Eclipse will lead to byte code with two return instructionsp  precodepublic boolean isEvenint x    return x  2  0  codepre  pByte code compiled with Eclipsep  precode   0 iload1    1 iconst2    2 irem    3 ifne          8    6 iconst1    7 ireturn        javac compilation goto 9    8 iconst0    9 ireturn codepre  pThus, I am wondering strongwhat the proper way to wrap the whole code of a method code is.strongp

Negative 63153 pIm trying to do web oauth2 with a provider which doesnt support CORS. my site supports many users which are identified by a token after login. the token is sent with the authorization header. I am doing the entire authentication on the server. Since the remote site doesnt support CORS, the client calls the oauth2 API by using window.location.assign. The problem is that I am loosing my authorization header when using the assign, so the server doesnt know to which user to relate the returned tokens. I am using Ionic and angular on my client, it is my first project with both. I am sure this is something a lot of you have encountered in the passed and I am missing some critical piece here. Thanks, Nirp

Negative 63153 pIm very new to OS X, as I just started learning it today out of necessity, so maybe this is a simple question.p  pIm testing a python wrapper script that encompasses several C files in Mac. I call scripts using codesubprocess.checkcallcode, with a sample parameter of codecScript   inputFile     outputFilecode. The scripts were all compiled using gcc in windows, and thus are .exe files. p  pThats the problem. When I run the python script I get OSError no such file or directory returned from checkcall. I have the OS X command line dev tools including gcc installed, and I even changed the permissions on the C scripts using chmod x. Nothing worked, however, and I get the same no such file error. Im sure theres a workaround for this, and Id love any help, but as a new, incompetent Mac user I dont understand why this is even an issue in the first place. p  pThanks in advancep  pNote I have extensively tested all of the scripts, including the wrapper script, in Windows using MingW and they all work fine.p

Negative 63153 pI have retrieved records from a mysql database and displayed it in my page using a loop. In each record displayed on the pageI have 4, there is a button and a span element with classes decrease and quantity respectively among other things.

Now I have been able to get all this to work except in one area.

Negative 63153 pIm trying to fetch a Core Data object and load it from a codeUITableViewcode that is NOT made up from Core Data objects. Its simply a codeUITableViewcode made with a predetermined array, but I want to load an object in Core Data with the same name as the cells codedetailTextLabelcode. I tried following a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaConceptualCoreDataArticlescdFetching.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40002484SW5 relnofollowthis tutoriala to load a specific value, but its not working It crashes or tells me my entity is codenilcode, which its not.p  pSo basically I have a codeUITableViewcode and it loads with this arrayp  precodearray  [publication 1,publication 2, etc] codepre  pThen, when a user selects the cell, I would like it to load a document based on the cells codedetailTextcode, but it always loads whatever the objects codeindexPathcode is, instead of based on the cells codedetailTextcode. So say in the main view controller where the predetermined array is loaded into the table view, I tap on Memo 24, but its index is 0,2 it strongwill load an objectstrong, but it will load the object in the downloads entity that has the same codeindexPathcode whatever publication is at 0,2 number as opposed to the Memo 24 title.p  pHere is my codep  precode voidtableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      UITableViewCell cell  [tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathindexPath]      [self loadPublicationLocallyWithPubAtIndexindexPath withTitlecell.detailTextLabel.text]    voidloadPublicationLocallyWithPubAtIndexNSIndexPath indexPath withTitleNSString pubNumber      NSManagedObjectContext selectedObject  [self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPathindexPath]     NSString phrase  nil  Document password for unlocking most encrypted PDF files     NSString filePath     NSArray paths  NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomainsNSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES     filePath  [[paths objectAtIndex0] stringByAppendingPathComponentPDFs]     filePath  [filePath stringByAppendingPathComponent[selectedObject valueForKeypuburl]] assertfilePath  nil      NSLogLocal path is  , filePath     if [[NSFileManager defaultManager] fileExistsAtPathfilePath]              File exists         NSData data  [[NSData alloc] initWithContentsOfFilefilePath]         if data                       load document                codepre  pIt works for all my view controllers that populate with Core Data, no matter what codeindexPathcode the cell is, it still retrieves the right object, so that leads me to believe it has something to do with the code[self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndex]code part, so I even tried p  precodeNSIndexPath selectedItem  [self.fetchedResultsController indexPathForObjectcell.detailTextLabel.text] codepre  pin codedidSelectRowAtIndexPathcode, but it doesnt work either.p  pHow do you load an object based on a cells codedetailTextLabelcode as opposed to its codeindexPathcodep

Negative 63153 pSo basically, I am tasked with recreating a 3D Earth, comprised of very small tiles made of NASA Landsat 8 images png. Each point on Earth is imaged once every 16 days or so, and the API Im using serves the latest images ie they cant be compiled offline and used statically .p  pThese tiles are 150kb each, and have a width and height of 0.025 latlong. This means that Ill probably have to use a static mesh for low zoom levels, and as a user zooms in, Landsat tiles will be dynamically generated based on their viewport.p  pHave any of you built a 3D Earth with custom tiling before I was looking at the a hrefhttpwww.webglearth.org relnofollowWebGL Earth APIa, but its very limited. Ive also taken a look at a hrefhttpcesiumjs.orgfeatures.html relnofollowCesiuma, but Im not sure if its capable of what I want to do.p  pBasically, Im looking for a 3D model of Earth or even just a sphere that will allow me to stick images to specific latlon points. Otherwise, I suppose Ill just have to make a sphere in ThreeJs and do the calculations myself, but Im afraid that without using a preexisting map system like a hrefhttpleafletjs.com relnofollowLeafleta, the whole thing will come out totally inaccurate. p

Negative 63153 pI have hosted my L5 project on digitalocean with Ubuntu 14.04. I have moved all files except codepubliccode to another directory and copied all files to root directory. My codemoderewritecode is enabled. I changed my codeetcapache2sitesavailable000default.confcode to below from this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28242495laraveltherequestedurlwasnotfoundonthisserverSolutiona p  precodeltVirtualHost 80gt          The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that          the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating          redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName          specifies what hostname must appear in the requests Host header to          match this virtual host. For the default virtual host this file this          value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.          However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.         ServerName www.example.com          ServerAdmin webmasterlocalhost         DocumentRoot varwwwhtml           Available loglevels trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,          error, crit, alert, emerg.          It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular          modules, e.g.         LogLevel info sslwarn          ErrorLog APACHELOGDIRerror.log         CustomLog APACHELOGDIRaccess.log combined           For most configuration files from confavailable, which are          enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to          include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the          following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only          after it has been globally disabled with a2disconf.

Negative 63153 pI am relatively new to android programming and I am having a few issues with how my database data is fetched. I am trying to create a simple messaging application. The data in the database is saving as expected but when it comes to displaying is where the issue is. The message activity displays all messages while the view message activity displays the activity thread. The issue is that the data displayed by he messages activity is ordered in a descending mode but the ID of each message loads ASCENDING and thereby messages do not get their actual conversation thread. I would like to know why the messages id are loaded in an ascending manner.

Negative 63153 pThe classic answer for listing all defined permissions is to use the codepm list permissionscode command. However, on Android 5.1 and the current preview edition of Android 6.0, that command does not list everything.p  pFor example, on a Nexus 4 running Android 5.1, I get output like thisp  precode adb shell pm list permissions fgrep WRITE permissioncom.intsig.camscanner.WRITECAMSCANNER permissionandroid.permission.WRITEGSERVICES permissioncom.google.android.providers.gsf.permission.WRITEGSERVICES permissioncom.android.voicemail.permission.READWRITEALLVOICEMAIL permissioncom.android.launcher3.permission.WRITESETTINGS permissioncom.google.android.providers.settings.permission.WRITEGSETTINGS permissioncom.android.chrome.permission.READWRITEBOOKMARKFOLDERS codepre  pcodeWRITEEXTERNALSTORAGEcode does not appear there. Yet that permission has been around since Android 1.6 or so. Similar commands show that codepm list permissionscode is missing codeREADEXTERNALSTORAGEcode, codeREADCONTACTScode, codeWRITECONTACTScode, codeINTERNETcode, and probably many others.p  pSo, if codepm list permissionscode does not give us a full roster of defined permissions on a device, is there another way of getting that datap  pIn theory, there may be a way to get it from codePackageManagercode, but I dont see a codegetAllPermissionscode method, and codegetAllPermissionGroupscode will leave out any permissions that are not in groups.p  pMy current reason for inquiry is that I want to see what permissions are defined on Android 6.0 and their protection levels, and we dont have the Android 6.0 source code yet AFAIK. There are permissions, like codeCHANGEWIFISTATEcode, codeBLUETOOTHcode, codeBLUETOOTHADMINcode, codeNFCcode, and others, that historically had been codedangerouscode. They are all still in the Android SDK, yet they are not listed among the permissions associated with the new Android 6.0 runtime permission system. So, I am trying to determine if they have been downgraded to codenormalcode or something. While I can do that through codePackageManagercode on a permissionbypermission basis, I was hoping to try to collect codeprotectionLevelcode values for all permissions.p

Negative 63153 pDuring using mvn install or mvn compile i got error that maven can not find symbol with different methods and variables in mozilla rhino classes. I made exclusions everywhere where it is possible and said to use 7r5 build for rhino. Also i decompiled jar and got sure that mentioned classes and methods in maven were in that classes. I had pom deps and i couldnt exclude all 3d libraries. So in classpath i saw also path to rhino 6r5 library. I thought that problem was there. So i also decompiled that jar but i saw that methods in the error were also there. My question is how i can debug maven and see what library or class it is using for compiling class. All mozilla rhino libraries which are set in classpath have that methods.

So my question is how to have visitors use SSL only sitewidep  pThanksp
Negative 63153 pThe codeCachingActivityMappercode will return the same activity instance if asked for the same codePlacecode twice or more. However, codePlaceControllercode will not fire a codePlaceChangeRequestEventcode and ultimately no codePlaceChangeEventcode if I was to codegoTo...code a place that equals the current one. As a result, the codeActivityManagercode listening to those events will not do anything, that is, it wont even ask the codeCachingActivityMappercode for an activity in this case.p  pSo, I dont really see the point of codeCachingActivityMappercode. Am I missing somethingp

Negative 63153 pI have an app that supports iOS8 and later, built in Xcode 7 and I am using a XIB for a Launch Screen I do not have launch images. The view contains a single UILabel with the app version, and 2 UIImageViews with images that are both present in Images.xcassets A logo and a splash image.p  pThe UILabel and the logo image appear correctly when I launch the application, but the splash image does not if I run the app on an iPad Air 2 with iOS9. I have tested on an Air and a Mini running iOS8, and iOS9 simulators for iPad 2, iPad Air, and iPad Air 2 and the image appears correctly in all of those.p  pI ran some basic troubleshooting to see if I could figure out what is going on but I havent been able to solve it and the only difference I can see between the image thats working and the one thats failing is emwhenem I added it to the assets...p  pHeres a rundown of what I knowp  ul lipThe UIImageView for the splash image is in the correct place, at the correct size. I can tell this because I set its background color to green just to make sure. The view is there, but the image does not appear. So Im assuming that the view is not to blame.pli lipSetting the UIImageView for the splash image to also use the logo image makes the logo image appear in the correct place for the view. This also leads me to assume that the view is not to blame.pli lipThe UIImage that I am using in the splash image view is used elsewhere in the app and appears fine in those other views the logo image is also used elsewhere in the app and appears fine. So Im assuming that the image is valid and having it appear in other views is not a problem.pli lipIve confirmed that the settings of the UIImages for the logo and splash in the xcassets file are the same. They are set to Universal, Any width and height, multiple scale factors, rendered as default. There is one difference  the logo has 1x, 2x and 3x scales while the splash image only has 1x and 2x, but I have also tried using UIImages with only 1x, and 1x and 2x values in the UIView and they work if they were added to the project some time ago.pli lipAdding another image of a different size or format PNG and JPG to my xcassets and using that UIImage in the UIImageView for the splash image also fails to display.pli lipAdding another UIImageView to the XIB file and allocating it a UIImage that was already in the xcassets works, the image appears in the loading screen.pli lipCopying and renaming the image files used for the logo and adding them to the project then using that UIImage in the splash view also fails to display.pli lipI have tried cleaning the project, restarting the development machine, and deleting the app from the Air 2 and reinstalling it just in case that was a problem.pli ul  pThese last three steps lead me to believe that theres some issue with images added after a certain point in the project files lifetime. While I updated to Xcode 7 yesterday, the splash image was originally added in Xcode 6, but the logo image also added in Xcode 6 was added some months before.p  pIve looked over the json files for the logo image and splash image and they appear to have the same format. Ive also trawled through the pbxproj file looking for differences and I cant see any.p  pSo I was wondering if anyone had any idea why the launch screen might not display these new images Im adding on the Air 2 specifically Other questions Ive been reading through relating to images not appearing all seem to relate either to Launch Images, or to images in XIB files that have associated classes, neither of which seems relevant here.p
