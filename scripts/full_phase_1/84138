And it involves the following subquestionsp  ul lipDoes the store accept traditional Windows apps, not specifically designed for the Store format or compatibility with Windows RT Can it use traditional Windows APIpli lipDoes it allow applications that use native DLLs 7z.dll in our casepli lipDoes it require specifically crafted installation package in order to be admitted to the Storepli lipCan a Windows Store desktop application freely access the file system to be able to create new archives and decompress existing archives, or it runs in some kind of sandboxed environmentpli ul  pWeve already tried Windows App Certification Kit, but it doesnt give the complete picture.p  pI plan to set up and award a bounty on this SO question. p

Positive 84138 pI recently migrated from Windows 8  VS2013 to Windows 10  VS2015. After doing so I can no longer build Windows 8 store apps  Im forced to upgrade to Windows 8.1 if I want to build the project. p  pHowever, I maintain two builds of my app  one for Windows 8 and one for 8.1. I have a number of customers who refuse to update to 8.1 No, I have no idea why and I dont want to leave them with an outdated version. Ive already upgraded the project to 8.1 and keep that separate. p  pIs there any way to build a Windows 8.0 app in Visual Studio 2015, without the forced upgrade p

Positive 84138 pI just got tripped up by this in a Windows Store app, here is a simplified examplep  preApp.cs Global timer  MainPage Subscribes to Global Timer, button to create a local timer, button to goto page 2  Page2 Subscribes to Global Timer, button to create local timer, back buttonpre  pOn MainPage, it click the button to create a local timer. I see it and the global timer ticking.p  pGoto page 2. Still see ticks coming from subscribed global timer and local timer on Main Page. Start the local timer on page 2. p  pGo back, on MainPage. Now see 5 timers runningp  preThe original MainPage subscribed to Global Timer the original MainPage subscribed to local timer A new subscription to Global Timer The Page2 subscribed to Global Timer The Page2 subscribed to its local timerpre  pI realize I can use the navigatedtofrom events to subscribeunsubscribe from the global timer. A bit of a pain because in my real example I can subscribe to dozens of different events in different pages from the global class. A little harder to find the timers created in the local timer button since there is no reference to it outside the button.p  pAre the subscribers keeping the previous pages alive or is this normal I looked at NavigationCacheMode mode, by default creates a new instance each time. I assumed everything was basically cleared, which is why to have to save the state of textboxs, etc, when going between pages.p  pIs the only way around this to unsubscribe to all global events when navigating away, and to keep a class level variable so I have a reference to one offs like my local timerp

Positive 84138 pIm making a paintlike program with a codeCanvascode and several shapes lines, rectangles etc that the user can draw inside it. I want the user to be able to make this codeCanvascode be scaled up and scaled down using pinch gestures to a large extent within reasonable limits, say 5x times smallerlarger from the default size of codeWidthcode1000 and codeHeightcode1000.p  pThis is pretty easily doable using a codeScaleTransformcode from the controls codeManipulationDeltacode. But I want the codeCanvascode to be as the same size as before meaning if the codeCanvascode took up the whole screen and then the user pinchesinwards, the codeCanvascode and its contents should get smaller but the codeCanvascode must still take up the whole screen space so everything looks smaller but now there is more room for the user to draw shapes.p  pTo do this, I tried increasing the codeWidthcode and codeHeightcode of the codeCanvascode in accordance with the amount scaled.p  precodeprivate void ccDrawManipulationDeltaobject sender, ManipulationDeltaRoutedEventArgs e              CanvasControl ccSender  CanvasControlsender         CompositeTransform ctSender  ccSender.RenderTransform as CompositeTransform          ctSender.ScaleX  e.Delta.Scale         ctSender.ScaleY  e.Delta.Scale          ccDraw.Width  1e.Delta.Scale  sizing up inverse of amount scaled down         ccDraw.Height  1e.Delta.Scale same here      codepre  pYoud think this code would do the trick Im offseting the smaller scale size with an increase in proportions so the end result would be the same  but no the codeCanvascode does shrink but there is no visible increase in codeWidthcodecodeHeightcode. However, I could see in the debug output that the HeightWidth value had changed from default value 5000 to 6000.13.p  pCan anybody tell me what Im doing wrong  Or if theres a better way to go about doing this  Note that the codeCanvascode is not really the inbuilt one but the codeCanvasControlcode from Win2D though it shouldnt matter.p

In this case, the CCItemValueAccessor function. The latter function will be called with an input parameter which, in this case, is a ToDo object. Each ToDo object will be rendered as one row in the grid. The job of the CCItemValueAccessor function is to return the column value to be displayed by the grid for the row that corresponds to the passedin ToDo object.p  pThis works fine till I take it to the next stepp  pI want to emdynamicallyem create columns at run time.  For example, I want to display the output of a datatable returned as a result of executing a userspecified SQL.p  pUsing the earlier described static approach, I have one columnItemValueAccessor function responsible for returning the value of each column in the grid for the passed in row object. Now, since the columns are determined at run time based on the SQL returned results, I believe I need to write a generic handler that handles all columns, determines the name of the column that triggered this event and then returns the value for that column within the row object that is passed in as the sole parameter. p  pThe problem is that the ItemValueAccessor function has a signature that only includes the row object and I do not know of a way to determine which column name is needed since all of the columns were hooked up to the same ItemValueAccessor function as the event handler.p  pI suspect that this is just a limitation of the control and that to overcome this problem I would have to enhance the underlying custom control, but that is likely beyond my current skills as it is an advanced control written in C and I am a VB guy.p  pHeres the codep  precodePrivate Sub AddCcColumn     Dim NewColumn As New BinaryComponents.SuperList.ColumnCC, CC, 110, AddressOf CcItemValueAccessor     SuperList.Columns.AddNewColumn End Sub  Private Function CcItemValueAccessorByVal rowItem As Object As Object     Dim ToDo As ToDo  CTyperowItem, SrToDoAndException.ToDo     Return ToDo.CCs.ToString End Function codepre  pp  pAnd here are the signatures of the Columns instantiator method and the definition of the last parameter which is responsible for specifying the procedure that handles identifies the event handler responsible for returning the value of the column.p  pPublic Sub NewByVal name As String, ByVal caption As String, ByVal width As Integer, ByVal columnItemValueAccessor As BinaryComponents.SuperList.ColumnItemValueAccessor      Member of BinaryComponents.SuperList.Columnp  pPublic Sub NewByVal object As Object, ByVal method As System.IntPtr      Member of BinaryComponents.SuperList.ColumnItemValueAccessorp  phr p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions or am I stuck I would really love to utilize the fantasic grouping capabilities of this control so I can display dynamic output that allows the user to group the dynamic output of a SQL by any column that they want.p  pI addressed the question to the author at the above site but it has gone unanswered. This is a desperate attempt to find a way to do this.p  pThanks for bearing with me. I hope this question isnt rejected based on the fact that I refer to a third party control. My hope is that the answer lies in a better understanding of delegates, a more universal topic.p

Negative 84138 pI have a windows service written in C .NET framework 3.5 and would like to know the best way to check if previous shutdown of a service was regular.p  pUpon starting the service, there should be a check if the last shutdown was regular via stop service button in services management or if somebody just killed the process or it crashed for some reason not directly linked to the service itself.p  pI thought about writing encrypted XML on a hard drive upon starting a service, and then editing it with some values when service is being stopped. In that way, after I start the service again next time, I could check the XML and see if the values were edited in correct way during shutdown, and if they were not Id know the process was killed or it crashed.p  pThis way seems too unreliable and not a good practice. What do you suggestp  pemClarificationem What the service does is it sits on a server and listens to connections from client machines. Once the connection has been established, it communicates to a remote database via web services and determines whether they have right to connect and therefore use application that is the caller. One of the aspects of protection is concurrency check, and if I have a limit set to 5 work stations, I keep the TcpClient connection alive from windows service to, lets say 5 workstations, and the sixth one cannot connect.p  pIf I kill the service process and restart it, the connections are gone and I have 5 licensed apps running on workstations, and now there are 5 free connection slots to be taken by 5 more.p

Negative 84138 pemNote Im using Zend Framework, but I think most of this applies to PHP coding in general.emp  pIm trying to choose a strategy for writing views scripts, possibly with the help of a templating engine. Motivations strongclarity and securitystrong. Im just not happy with writing .phtml scripts. This syntax is awfully verbose to do the most often needed thing  outputting a variablep  precodeltphp echo thisgtescapethisgtmyVariable gt codepre  pIn addition to the code being lengthy, IMHO the template author shouldnt have to remember and bother writing an escape call each time heshe wants to output a variable. Forgetting the call will almost definitely result in an XSS vulnerability.p  pI have two possible solutions for this problemp  pstrongSolution 1 A template engine with automatic escapingstrongp  pI think at least a hrefhttpsmarty.net relnofollowSmartya has an option for automatically escaping html entities when outputting variables. There are a hrefhttpnosmarty.net relnofollowpoints against Smartya, but maybe at least some of them are addressed in the upcoming 3.0  I havent checked yet.p  pXML based template engines like a hrefhttpphptal.org relnofollowPHPTALa will also escape any data by default. They might look quite odd for a beginner, though. Maybe still worth tryingp  pstrongSolution 2 Escape the data in the Modelstrongp  pOf course, the other option would be to escape the needed data already in the Model or even the controller. The Model should already know the contenttype mainly plain text or HTML text of each field, so it would be kind of logical to escape the data there. The view could consider all data as safe HTML. This would allow eg. changing the datatype of a field from plain text to HTML without touching the view script  only by changing the Model.p  pBut then again, it doesnt feel like good MVC practice. In addition, there are problems with this approach as wellp  ul lisometimes the view only wants to print the first n characters, and we dont want to end up truncating the data codefoo amp barcode as codefoo ampamcode having first escaped it as codefoo ampamp barcodeli limaybe the view wants to construct an URL with varNamevarName in the querystring  again, escaping already in the Model would be bad. li ul  pThese problems could be addressed by providing two versions of the data, or unescaping in the template. Seems bad to me.p  pIdeas Am I missing something What do you consider the best practicep  pPS. This post is about finding a general solution for any usersupplied plaintext data that may contain codeltcode or codegtcode or any other characters. So, filtering data before saving it to the database isnt the solution.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThanks for all comments so far. I did some more research and will next evaluate a hrefhttpwww.twigproject.org relnofollowTwiga and possibly a hrefhttpwww.invenzzia.orgenprojectsopenpowerlibrariesopenpowertemplate relnofollowOpen Power Templatea. Both seem interesting Twig looks very straightforward, but the project is young. On the XML side, OPTs syntax looks a bit nicer than PHPTALs. Both Twig and OPT are quite well documented.p

Negative 84138 pI am displaying a combo box in something of a WYSIWYG preview. I want the user to be able to click on the combo box and see the options inside, but I dont want them to be able to change the value. I tried using preventDefault on the change event but it doesnt work. I dont want to disable it because I do want the user to be able to look inside the dropdown.p  pSo Im trying to block the change, but cant. My next resort is to change the selected index back to what it was before the change, Is there any way to do this within the scope of a ListEvent.CHANGE event listenerp  pCurrent Workaround is to basically reassign the controls selected item the same way I am defining the selected item when I originally build it a default selection. So a user sees their change then it immediately changes back to the default selection.p

Negative 84138 pI have a tablegrid system with seven days along the top and the various types of data down the side. For each type of data against a particular day, theres a plus and minus sign so the user can increase or decrease the data occurrences. Given that there are plenty of data types as well as seven for each day values for each type, whats the best way to do it p  pIm dubious about Ajax as each plus and minus click would call a database operation, but the only other alternative please correct me if Im wrong is that I dynamically update the values of a form and then force the user to submit once theyve submitted all the information they need  but isnt this a lot of form values to processp

Here is a simple example.p  precodestring[] words   believe, receipt, relief, field  bool result  words.AsParallel.Anyw gt w.Containsei codepre  pWith LINQ, I would expect the execution to reach the receipt value and return true, without executing the query for rest of the values.  p  pIf we do this in parallel, the evaluation of relief may have began before the result of receipt has returned.

Negative 84138 pI found a question already with a possible solution, but I had already tried the method suggested before reading it, and it even says its inconsistent.

But in the above scenario, Im just trying to tap into the new window to get what its alreadyset src. I have codeimgwin.htmlcode already written with a default codesrccode for the image, so it should alert that url. Instead I just get codeundefinedcode.p  pI also tried the following which should be identical on the back end, but with the same resultsp  precodeimg.clickfunction      var imgwindow  window.openimgwin.html,,width460,height345     alertimg,imgwindow.attrsrc  codepre  pI even tried variations of wrapping the codeimgwindowcode variable in codecode in case somehow jquery wasnt picking up on the variable as a DOM element.p  pThe only thing I can guess is that since codewindow.opencode is a method, jquery doesnt treat it like a DOM element, even though all documentation from basic javascript tutorials treat the variable as both a method to open the window and the pointer to the windows inner DOM.p  h2Noteh2  pI usually prefer and recommend to other developers the use of the jqueryui dialog widget, but in this scenario, the images are actually webcam feeds that the user will want to pop out of the main window and have open even if the main window is closed, so while I appreciate the move from popup windows in general, please avoid suggesting alternatives that involve samewindow widgets.

But I cant, for the life of me, get the installer to fire up my window.  I have tried putting [STAThread] on the method.  I have tried firing up a thread and setting the ApartmentState to STA.  I am guessing its something really simple that I am over looking.  Anyone have any thoughts  p  pThanks in advance..  p  pcmb..p

Negative 84138 pIm currently working on a class which exposes an internal List through a property. The List shall and can be modified. The problem is, entries in the internal list could be set to null from outside the class.p  pMy code actually looks like thisp  precodeclass ClassWithList      Listltobjectgt list  new Listltobjectgt       get accessor, which however returns the reference to the list,      therefore the list can be modified this is intended     public Listltobjectgt Data              get                      return list                    private void doSomeWorkWithTheList              foreachobject obj in list              do some work with the objects in the list without checking for null.       codepre  pSo now in the doSomeWorkWithTheList I could always check whether the current list entry is null or I could just asume that the person using this class doesnt have the great idea to set entries to null. p  pSo finally the questions end up in Whose fault is a NullReferenceException in this case Is it the fault of the class developer not checking everything for null which would make code generally  not only in this class  more complex or is it the fault of the user of this class, as setting a List entry to null doesnt really make sense Id tend to generally not check values for null except in some really special cases. Is this a bad style or de facto standard  standard in praxis p  pI know theres probably no ultimate answer for this, Im just missing enough experience for such thing and therefore wondering what other developers think about such cases and want to hear whats done in reality about checking null or not.p

Negative 84138 pI am writing an algorithm for finding longs path over several turnpoints given a list of coordinates that describe a path. The dynamic programming algorithm works nicely in Okn2, where k is the number of turnpoints and n number of points.

Memoization is not an option too many points. It is possible to invert the algorithm  but somehow the inverted algorithm is very slow in haskell and eats too much memory. p  pIt seems to me that the problem is following you are given an array of arrays of fixed size plus some dynamically computed value  e.g. this would be the result of zipping the value with the listp  precodearr  [ 2, [10,5,12], 1, [2,8, 20], 4, [3, 2, 10] ] codepre  pI am trying to find a maximum over the elements of the list plus the fixed valuep  precode[12, 9, 21] codepre  pWhat I am doing  something likep  precodefoldl getbest replicate 3 0 arr getbest acc fixval, item  map comparator  zip acc item comparator orig new      new  fixval gt orig  new  fixval      otherwise  orig codepre  pThe problem is that a new acc gets built with each call to getbest  which is n2 which is a lot.

Negative 84138 pWhat reasons could there be for the following strange behaviour, and how might I track down the issuesp  pWe use a combination of make files and msbuild.p  pI have a project which needs to be strongly named.  I was previously setting the snk to use in the project file like thisp  precodeltAssemblyOriginatorKeyFilegtEnvironmentVariableTheKeyName.snkltAssemblyOriginatorKeyFilegt  codepre  pwhere EnvironmentVariable was defined in the batch file that launched the shell for the build like thisp  precodeset EnvironmentVariableSomePath codepre  pand this worked ok.  Now I need the string name key to be able to be changed, so it can be different on the dev machine and the release build server.  There is a variable which exists to hold the full path to the strong name key file, called StrongNameKeyFile.  This is defined in the msbuild environment, and if I put some text output in the targets or properties files that are included as part of the msbuild task which build the project then I can see that this StrongNameKeyFile points to the correct location.  So I changed the csproj to have this insteadp  precodeltAssemblyOriginatorKeyFilegtStrongNameKeyFileltAssemblyOriginatorKeyFilegt codepre  pbut when I try and compile this is evaluating to empty and no keyfile is specified during the build.p  pWe also have variable defined in the make files and these can be accessed in the csproj as well.  These are used to point to the locations of referenced dlls, so that they can be different on dev and build machines.  I know that these are set as the references come out correctly and everything compiles, but if I try and use one of these variables in the AssemblyOriginatorKeyFile element then it evaluates to empty in that element, but works in the reference element.  p  pWhy might this be  Is AssemblyOriginatorKeyFile treated specially somehow  How can I go about tracking the cause of this downp

Negative 84138 pOn the project which I am currently working, I have to read an Excel file with over a 1000 rows, extract all them and insertupdate to a database table.p  ol lipin terms of performance, is better to add all the records to a codeDoctrineCollectioncode and insertupdate them after using the codefromArraycode method, right One other possible approach is to create a new object for each row a Excel row will be a object and them save it but I think its worst in terms of performance.pli lipEvery time the Excel is uploaded, it is necessary to compare its rows to the existing objects on the database.

Negative 84138 pIve just started working on a Java project as I usually use .net, and one of the first things that strikes me as odd is that in the Maven project there is a src and a test directory where obviously the source code and the tests should go.p  pIn .net I preferred to have the tests in a separate assemblyproject, so for example I would havep  ul liMyProjectli liMyProject.Testsli ul  pThat way I dont have to bloat my deployed code with any tests and it makes it easier to test my code in true isolation and in alot of cases I didnt bother writing tests per project, I would just have solution wide unitintegrationacceptance tests i.e MySolution.UnitTests, MySolution.IntegrationTests.p  pHowever in Java it just seems to be bundled together, and I would rather separate it out, however I hear that Maven is a cruel mistress when you want to do things differently to the default structures.p  pSo to reign this post back in, my main questions arep  ul liIs there a way to separate out the tests from the projectli liBased on the above information are there any pros for actually having the tests within the project other than when you check it out you always have the tests thereli ul

Negative 84138 pSuper Meat Boy is a difficult platformer that recently came out for PC, requiring exceptional control and pixelperfect jumping. The physics code in the game is dependent on the framerate, which is locked to 60fps this means that if your computer cant run the game at full speed, the physics will go insane, causing among other things your character to run slower and fall through the ground. Furthermore, if vsync is off, the game runs extremely fast.p  pCould those experienced with 2D game programming help explain why the game was coded this way Wouldnt a physics loop running at a constant rate be a better solution Actually, I think a physics loop is used for parts of the game, since some of the entities continue to move normally regardless of the framerate. Your character, on the other hand, runs exactly [fps60] as fast.p  pWhat bothers me about this implementation is the loss of abstraction between the game engine and the graphics rendering, which depends on systemspecific things like the monitor, graphics card, and CPU. If, for whatever reason, your computer cant handle vsync, or cant run the game at exactly 60fps, itll break spectacularly. Why should the rendering step in any way influence the physics calculations Most games nowadays would either slow down the game or skip frames. On the other hand, I understand that oldschool platformers on the NES and SNES depended on a fixed framerate for much of their control and physics. Why is this, and would it be possible to create a patformer in that vein without having the framerate dependency Is there necessarily a loss of precision if you separate the graphics rendering from the rest of the enginep  pThank you, and sorry if the question was confusing.p

Negative 84138 pIm taking a sprite sheet and splitting it up into an array.  I then take that array and rotate the image by a certain granularity and push that onto the end of the array too to pre bake the rotations for faster drawing no hardware acceleration.  The final result looks something like thisp  precodearray[0]  frame1 of the animation array[1]  frame2 of the animation array[2]  frame3 of the animation array[3]  frame1 of the animation rotated at 45 degrees array[4]  frame2 of the animation rotated at 45 degrees array[5]  frame3 of the animation rotated at 45 degrees array[6]  frame1 of the animation rotated at 90 degrees ... etc codepre  pSo now Im trying to come up with a function thatll return the right element for any angle at the right granularity.  For example, say my ingame object is currently rotated 30 degrees and is on frame1 of the animation, I would want array[3].  If I was on frame2 of the animation, I would want array[4].  If the object was rotated 80 degrees and was on frame1, I would want array[6], and so on.p  pThese are the constants I have The  of animation frames prerotation The  of animation frames postrotation The Granularity of the Rotations from 1 to 360, ie granularity of 45 would be the above example.p  pThis is the signature of the function to calculate the frame codefunction calculateImageIndexanimationFrame  Number, currentAngle  Number  Numbercodep  pAny ideas on how to calculate this  Im stumped.p

Each month is represented four times there are 4 types so this table has 48 rows.br br I have a selection that gives me the number of days per period simply, the day out of the EndDate, since its always the amount of days in that period and Amount1PerDay and Amount2PerDay the amount of that period divided by the number of days.br br The first problem isbr I need a codeViewcode on this table that shows me one row for each day in every period with the Amount1 and Amount2 columns that hold the value of that period divided by the number of days in that period.br br The second problem isbr Most of these divisions do not give me a whole number. Decimals are not an option, so I need to divide the remaining days after division among the first days of that period. Take January as an example Amount1 has 89. Divided over 31 days thats almost 2,9. So its 2 per day, and the first 27 days get 3 ,9  31  27. That way the result has only whole numbers in it.p

Negative 84138 pI was looking to find a way to use include statement using a fifo named pipe file created with posixmkfifo. As my expectations were high I got very depressed to see the page blocked, waiting for an action that I was sure it wont ever happen. p  pSo... my logic dictated that as include surely use some kind of fopenfamily function, and fifos can be opened this way, my only thing to do was to create one, then write in it, maybe keep the resource alive until it was included, include the file, close the handler, delete the file. But of course it was nothing like that. I suppose that include opens the file in a blocking manner and this behavior is the cause of my problem.  Having worked with fifos in c, I noticed that in a nonblocking open method the information in fifo is preserved until a reader decides to read it. I was hoping on the same behavior. p  pAlthough I tried to open another page to write to the same fifo, so that the reader can continue, that was bound to fail also. Furthermore, not only the page did not respond anymore, but it failed to answer to the user abort also, fact due to I had my sessions blocked for several minutes, as sessionstart would tell me that there cannot be used by two processes at once  I might be wrong here about the error message, I can remember well, and I have deleted the test files. p  pMy question is if there is any way to achieve this effect of including using a fifo. p  pIn the end, to answer all the questions about why the hell am I doing this I will say that my system puts itself between the real code and its processing with the purpose of modifying it on need in a dynamic manner, completely reversible. And for that it needs to read the original file, check the code, change it when it seems to and then write it in a file, in a new root folder, keep the folder and files hierarchy and then include the file.  At the moment, I replaced the use of fifos with the one of real files, but I need to filter a lot of code. And eval, although overused in my functions, is not a solution as it do not keep the current directory and the script name, or anything specific to an actual file, besides that it is very sensible with many things, especially with relative paths, and weird uses of php syntax. So I am still stuck with writing in files.p  pBecause of that the system is a terrible time consumer and a bad resource manager, my original idea was to write in fifos that are more light, kept in memory, volatile, and really made for the only purpose of IPC.p  pWith respect,  paulp

Negative 84138 pIve got a telerik radchart thats displaying a beautiful and incrediblyusefultoenduser line chart. p  pOne of the requirements for this chart was to have a xvalue crosshair on the graph e.g. when a user hovers at any point over the graph, a horizontal line appears, and where this line intersects the actual graph line, a value is displayed in another area of the screen.p  pIn a previous iteration, I used flotJS to do my graphing amp crosshairing, worked great, and was blazing fast.

Negative 84138 pI am try to fit an eGARCH model on an expanding basis using the rugarch package.  I have 6 columns of data, and I am trying refit parameters 6000 for each column.  If I run the following code, I get an error in windows on the 2nd column this means I am getting all the way through the first inner loop succesfully.  By using gc within the loop and removing the fitted object I have extended the length of time it takes to hit the memory error.  Also, this process takes a very long time in general and I am wondering if there is anyway to improve it on my end.  The package itself seems to be written pretty efficiently with most of the filtering being done in low level C.  I could probably refit the model every 3060 days, but I would really prefer to do it this way.  I am running R 2.13.2 on 32Bit windows.  Thanks in advance.

We decided on the Rijndael algorithm because of the ease of which it can be implemented in C.NET.p  pCurrently encryption runs like thisp  precodeFileStream fileStreamForEncryption  new FileStream inputFileToBeEncrypted, FileMode.Create RijndaelManaged rijndaelCryptography  new RijndaelManaged CryptoStream encryptionStream  new CryptoStreamfileStreamForEncryption, rijndaelCryptography .CreateEncryptorkey, iv, CryptoStreamMode.Write FileStream fsIn  new FileStreaminputFile, FileMode.Open int data while data  fsIn.ReadByte  1   cs.WriteBytebytedata fsIn.Close cs.Close fileStreamForEncryption .Close codepre  pThis means that decryption is a matter of running a few commands and getting the decrypted file... except that, because of the design of the rest of the code encryption seems to have been a once weve got the system running to a given standard, the file needs to be returned as a StreamReader object.

Id also love to do this without writing the file back to disk theres a reason were encrypting them, obviously.p  pThank you in advance, and sorry if I havent been clear enough or a little vague.

I was hoping to just be able to upgrade that one package, as hopefully I dont believe I have too many programs installed that depend on Boost libraries just the ones Im coding.p  pI need to use the new features in 1.48.0. If I cant install them via an RPM, can I compile them as a normal user, store them in lib and link against them p  pIm on FC16 x8664.p

Negative 84138 pLet me start by saying Javascript is not my strong point, and all of the searches I have done for information on this topic have resulted in how to deal with url encodedecoding strings.p  pIm having trouble with some code similar to the followingp  precodelta href onclickltphp echo alertamp039 gtgttestltgt codepre  pI would expect that since the value being passed to alert is url encoded, that when clicking the link an alert box would be shown with the value codeamp039code in it.p  pIt turns out that because the it is between the quotes for the onclick, the browser is decoding 039 to a single quote before executing.

Negative 84138 pThe a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidcontentContext.htmlstartService28android.content.Intent29 relnofollowdocoa for startService  states If this service is not already running, it will be instantiated and started creating a process for it if needed if it is running then it remains running. Im finding that each call to startService appears to be starting a strongseparatestrong instance of the service, in that the work that the service is doing in my test case, trivially writing to a new log file is being done again for each call. Im trying to detect the service by looping through  ActivityManager... getRunningServicesInteger.MAXVALUE but its not showing up. Android 2.3.3 on SGS 11 Im missing something here. I understood that the Services onCreate method only gets called when its created, and that since I have a continuous process running in the Service the  p  pIn my Activitys onResume method Im starting the service myServicewithp  precode    Intent intent  new Intentthis, myService.class startServiceintent codepre  pIn MyService I have an onCreate likep  precodeOverride   public void onCreate     super.onCreate     ... codepre  pfrom where I set a timer, using a TimerTask, which writes to a log file oncesecond.p  pThis works as expected  I can see the log being written. In the Activitys onResume method, before calling the StartService method, Im checking to see if the myService service exists by calling a checkForRunningService method containingp  precodefor RunningServiceInfo service  manager.getRunningServicesInteger.MAXVALUE      if service.service.getClassName.contentEqualscom.gpsanimator.startrax.myService      Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext, Service IS SO running , Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show         return true  codepre  pThis never finds the myService service, even though it appears to be running as its happily writing to the log file.p  pEeach time I resume my Activity, the onCreate method of my myService service gets called  it generates a new log file and starts writing to it as well as the original log file being continuously updated. Doesnt the Service get started the first time the startService is called And then continue running Shouldnt subsequent calls to startService find the Service already running and therefore not trigger the onCreate method again But thats not what Im seeing. It seems that every call to startService is triggering the Services onCreate method.p  pIts obviously more complicated than this, and I would like to get to the bottom of it.p

Negative 84138 pIm trying to create moving lights with trails for an HTML5 websiteapp targeted at iPad 2. I wonder what the best way to do this is and whether using HTML5 is viable at all. I chose HTML5 because its easier and cheaper to develop and deploy than native iOS apps with Objective C. Of course if it turns out that HTML5 simply doesnt offer enough performance I might have to swallow the bitter pill.p  pAnyway to give you an impression what Im talking about, this is what I got so farp  pimg srchttpdevdali.noip.orgmathiastestlightsscreenshots1.jpg altscreenshotp  pOr you can see it in action a hrefhttpdevdali.noip.orgmathiastestlightsframe.htmlherea only works in webkit based browsers.p  pAt first I tried using HTML5 canvas and drawing radial gradients as particles in similar manner you see above. It worked but the framerate was horrible even on my desktop computerp  pSo after a bit of reading I found out that CSS3 transforms may be hardware accelerated, so I build the version you see above. Every particle is a 64x64 png image. For each light there is the head light one img followed by a trail consisting of 115 img elements. Each img element is transformed using translate3d as well as scale and rotation. Also the opacity of each element is adjusted dynamically. p  pDoing it this way provided much better framerates on my computer, but I doubt the iPad 2 will handle it.p  pId be grateful if anyone could give me some hints on how to improve the performance of this in general and considering the target platform.p  pThanks for any help in advancep

Negative 84138 pWhile Scala actors are described as lightweight, Akka actors even more so, there is obviously some overhead to using them.p  pSo my question is, what is the smallest unit of work that is worth parallelising with Actors assuming it can be parallelized Is it only worth it if there is some potentially latency or there are a emlotem of heavy calculationsp  pIm looking for a general rule of thumb that I can easily apply in my everyday work.p  pEDIT The answers so far have made me realise that what Im interested in is perhaps actually the eminverseem of the question that I originally asked. Sop  pAssuming that structuring my program with actors is a very good fit, and therefore incurs no extra development overhead or even incurs emlessem development overhead than a nonactor implementation would, but the units of work it performs are quite small  is there a point at which using actors would be damaging in terms of performance and should be avoidedp
Negative 84138 pIts been many years 10 since Ive done any JavaScript development and now that Im getting back into some JS development, it is truly amazing the state of affairs.  It seems there are tons of libraries out there.p  pWell, heres my question, I remember we used to do asynchronous JS function calls using XmlHttlRequests.  I remember the we used to write explicit functions by listening to states like 4 and so on.  In hindsight, seems like very lowlevel JS compared to some of the stuff Im seeing nowadays.  p  pCurrent problem, Im consuming a JS function from a 3rd party API that is synchronous.  Is there any way I can make it asynchronous, if it doesnt have a callback parameter, wo the original API author changing  Any wrapper, pattern, or any of these new libraries could do thisp  pThanks for any advicep

Negative 84138 pIn C or ObjectiveC, is the term constructor exactly the same as initializerp  pThe reason is that, whenever I see the term constructor, it feels somewhat vague, because it also feels like the constructor is responsible for setting up the object in the memory space, while in fact, constructors merely initialize.  So the term constructor can be confusing because it feels like it is alloc and init combined, while the term initializer is very clear that it is merely setting up values.p  pIs the above statement generally correctp

This was supposed to help us scale as the load on our system increases.p  pWere in the middle ow writing the new BL and Ive been comparing the performance of the application modules before and after migrating them to use the new BL.

If   you are sure youre not intentionally defining a core class, then this   is the most likely explanation of whats going on.p      pHowever, you might actually be trying to define a class in a core   namespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example, from a   nonAndroid virtual machine project. This will most assuredly not   work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the compatibility of your app with   future versions of the platform. It is also often of questionable   legality.p      pIf you really intend to build a core library  which is only   appropriate as part of creating a full virtual machine distribution,   as opposed to compiling an application  then use the   corelibrary option to suppress this error message.p      pIf you go ahead and use corelibrary but are in fact building an   application, then be forewarned that your application will still fail   to build or run, at some point. Please be prepared for angry customers   who find, for example, that your application ceases to function once   they upgrade their operating system. You will be to blame for this   problem.p      pIf you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a core   package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to repackage   that code. That is, move the classes in question into your own package   namespace. This means that they will never be in conflict with core   system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help you in this endeavor.   If you find that you cannot do this, then that is an indication that   the path you are on will ultimately lead to pain, suffering, grief,   and lamentation.p      p[20120718 104548  myapp] Dx 1 error abortingp      p[20120718 104548  myapp] Conversion to Dalvik format   failed with error 1p blockquote  pThis is how my project looks int he explorer img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXRJTg.jpg althttps14.directupload.netimages120718zzy6mmym.jpgp

The thing is that when I run the php script using the browser it is executed without any problemsfailures etc. But when I try to run it using crons or SSH I get weird errorsp  blockquote   pNotice  Undefined index HTTPUSERAGENT in homelovespublichtmlparsershopparseclass.php on line 125   PHP Notice  Undefined offset 0 in homelovespublichtmlparsershopparseclass.php on line 481   PHP Notice  Undefined offset 1 in homelovespublichtmlparsershopparseclass.php on line 482   PHP Notice  Undefined variable cat in homelovespublichtmlparsershopparseclass.php on line 538p blockquote  pAs you can see from the errors it shows that, for example the option HTTPUSERAGENT doesnt exist for the CURL, which is kinda weird. Maybe the problem is with the environment variables, however I have poor knowledge of linux system.p

It works as it is, but...p  pThe problem is this Now that we know it all works, its time to simplify everything so that we can run the test program on a tablet. So the code needs to be stripped down to the bare bones. We need to remove everything from the SkeletalViewer code except for the elements that gather and process the data, so that it can be used in another program.p  pIve been asked to build a console app from scratch rather than tearing apart the sample codeas this is extremely messy that allows us to use the Kinect with our test program.p  pIve spent the last few weeks trying to figure out the code and Im feeling overwhelmed I dont know where to start.p  pHeres my question what are the absolute bare essential building blocks in the Kinect program I do not need it to draw ANYTHING.

Negative 84138 pI have set up a demo application with a simple codeUITableViewControllercode with no contents, but an Add button in the toolbar. This launches a modal view controller which is again empty other than a cancel button. The cancel button just tells its codedelegatecode the codeUITableViewControllercode to dismiss the modal.p  pI then added an codeNSLogcode statement in the codeUITableViewControllercodes codenumberOfSectionsInTableViewcode method.p  pOrdinarily, when the table view controller loads I see two calls to codenumberOfSectionsInTableViewcode. When I open and dismiss the modal which returns to the codeUITableViewControllercode I see no further calls to codenumberOfSectionsInTableViewcode.p  pHowever, if I return code0code from codenumberOfSectionsInTableViewcode, in addition to the two calls on display, I also see an additional numberOfSections call when the modal is dismissed.p  pThis only happens when codenumberOfSectionsInTableViewcode returns code0code, and I have added no additional code to my project besides that mentioned. This is easily verifiable by setting up a couple of controllers as Ive described and modifying the result from codenumberOfSectionsInTableViewcode.p  pMy questionsp  ul liWhy is the codeUITableViewcode calling codenumberOfSectionsInTableViewcode on return from a modal viewli liWhy is it only doing this if codenumberOfSectionsInTableViewcode returns code0codeli liIn addition to codenumberOfSectionsInTableViewcode, the codeUITableViewControllercode is also calling codecellForRowAtIndexcode when the modal is dismissed. In fact, it is attempting to display the new contents of its codedataSourcecode. How am I meant to manually animate a row insertion if the first row added is going to already be updated automatically Shouldnt it be left to me to make sure that my codeUITableViewcode is consistent with its codedataSourcecodeli liWhat property is the codeUITableViewControllercode checking to know that there is one or more sections and therefore ask my delegate how many sections It cant be codenumberOfSectionsInTableViewcode itself, since I would see it called whenever I return from the modal, not only when numberOfSections  0.li ul

Negative 84138 pI want to create a JTextArea which looks like JTextArea, acts like JTextArea, responds like JTextArea, speaks like JTextArea, moves like JTextArea, etc, but is not JTextArea.p  pTo make it short, Id like to create a custom swing component based 100 on JTextArea. Once I do that, Ill be able to change different otherwise hardcoded properties of a JTextArea and make my own customised JTextArea. There are no predefined swing components that are designed the way I need them to be, but JTextArea is the closest, that why I choose it.p  pId like to change the spacing inbetweem the rows of a JTextArea. And no, I dont want to use JtextPane, Ive tried, it doesnt work with my program, it calcualtes it position diferently, it look diferently, and applying the JtextArea border just messes thing up further.p  pstrongIm not trying to extend the JTextArea, Im trying to create a custom JTextArea, as in a hrefhttptoday.java.netpubatoday20070222howtowritecustomswingcomponent.html relnofollowcustom swing componenta, with changed hardcoded properties that are not configurable trought JTextAreas methods.strongp  pHowever, I have no idea how to do it. Ive been looking it up on the internet, but there is only an extensive guide about building your own component from stracth...p  pFiguring that out will take a lot of time and will not really solve my problem.p  pOnly thing I have to do is create a class or several classes that will contain everyting that builds JTextArea. Start from JTextComponent level and copy all the lower level classes that are used in creating JTextArea. Id also like to note that I use Nibus look and feel, I think that there may be some classes that would need to be included for the custom JTextArea to function properly under that LAF.p  pIve looked into the swing source code, and its full of everyting. Figuring out what classes or their parts are used in creating a JTextArea would be a time consuming nightmare, given that I have no knowledge about core swing structure and mechanics.p  pThats why Im asking somebody who has the knowledge to at least list the classes that I need to replicate the JTextArea, and Ill then figure out how to compose them.p  pBecause, if I start learning now about swing core mechanics, itll take days and weeks before I figure it all out, but for someone who knows, it would take only a couple of minutes to list all classes that I need to focus my attention onto.p  pIm trying to take a shortcut here. I dont want to fully understand swing, I just want this thing to work. Default spacing is one pixel too low, and all I want to do is just make it that pixel higher. I dont want to know how the painter paints component onto screen, I just want to know where is it called from and what does it call itself...p  pThanks to anyone who takes the time.p

Negative 84138 pI guess, this is a very simple question. I want my wordpress theme to automatically change some global variables on a given date.p  pMy Theme changes color and some other things every two months. From now on, I want to type in the needed variables before that date and let Wordpress do the changes. I could do that from within the loop, so that the first person who enters the site on that date initiates the change. But that would mean extra code, everytime the loop is called.

Negative 84138 pThe a hrefhttpopenni.org relnofollowKinect OpenNI librarya uses a custom video file format to store videos that contain rgbd information. These videos have the extension .oni. I am unable to find any information or documentation whatsoever on the ONI video format.p  pIm looking for a way to convert a conventional rgb video to a .oni video. The depth channel can be left blank ie zeroed out. For example purposes, I have a MPEG4 encoded .mov file with audio and video channels.p  pThere are no restrictions on how this conversion must be made, I just need to convert it somehow Ie, imagemagick, ffmpeg, mencoder are all ok, as is custom conversion code in CC etc.p  pSo far, all I can find is a hrefhttpsgithub.comOpenNIOpenNIblobmasterSamplesNiConvertXToONINiConvertXToONI.cpp relnofollowone C conversion utility in the OpenNI sourcesa. From the looks of it, I this converts from one .oni file to another though. Ive also managed to find a hrefhttpwww.uco.esdptosaceytearquitecturaprofesoresjcgamezRESEARCH28English29 relnofollowa C script by a phd student that converts images from a academic database into a .oni filea. Unfortunately the code is in spanish, not one of my native languages.p  pAny help or pointers much appreciatedp  pEDIT As my usecase is a little odd, some explanation may be in order. The OpenNI Drivers in my case Im using the excellent a hrefhttpwww.mathworks.com.aumatlabcentralfileexchange30242kinectmatlab relnofollowKinect for Matlab librarya allow you to specify a .oni file when creating the Kinect context. This allows you to emulate having a real Kinect attached that is receiving video data  useful when youre testing  developing code you dont need to have the Kinect attached to do this. In my particular case, we will be using a Kinect in the production environment process control in a factory environment, but during development all I have is a video file  Hence wanting to convert to a .oni file. We arent using the Depth channel at the moment, hence not caring about it.p

Negative 84138 pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyx7Xf.gif altenter image description herep  pHi. If you look at the image above, you will see a set of very weirdlooking characters displayed along with some Latin characters. The weird ones are Eritrean characters. They are the characters we use in my country. So, to go strait to the point, I am hoping to create even the simplest possible bit of software or maybe even a batch file if possible to help me make these characters applicable on the web and make PCs understand and display them when being typed. Just like Arabic, Hindu, Chinese... characters are used. I think, since the question of creating a language is often rare or because I may not know the correct term to use, when I searched the internet to find any tutorial or even a freelancer or anything, all I got was... nothing. So, I am hoping, if anyone can give me a stepbystep guide, or even just a clue about how to create this, would be very helpful. p  pThanks.p

I am just curious if there is just some official documentation that when groupped you need to return tableViewCell thats 20 points narrower than UITableViewCell, because I am not seeing that anywhere.p  precode UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      NSUInteger row  [indexPath row]      NearbyShortcutTableViewCell  cell      if[self.arrayOfItems[row] isNotEmpty]         cellNearbyShortcutTableViewCell self.arrayOfItems[row]          POcell     POcell.superview     POcell.superview.superview     return cell    cell.superview.superview null      cell ltNearbyShortcutTableViewCell 0x89a8300 baseClass  UITableViewCell  frame  0 0 300 50 layer  ltCALayer 0x89a8420gtgt      cell.superview null      cell.superview.superview null      cell ltNearbyShortcutTableViewCell 0x89a9030 baseClass  UITableViewCell frame  0 0 300 50 layer  ltCALayer 0x89f3d60gtgt      cell.superview null      cell.superview.superview null      cell ltNearbyShortcutTableViewCell 0x8bbf5e0 baseClass  UITableViewCell frame  0 754 320 50 autoresize  W layer  ltCALayer 0x8bbf700gtgt      cell.superview null      cell.superview.superview null      cell ltNearbyShortcutTableViewCell 0x8bb48b0 baseClass  UITableViewCell frame  0 704 320 50 autoresize  W layer  ltCALayer 0x8bbe6d0gtgt      cell.superview null      cell.superview.superview null      cell ltNearbyShortcutTableViewCell 0x8bb4050 baseClass  UITableViewCell  frame  0 654 320 50 autoresize  W layer  ltCALayer 0x8bbe2c0gtgt codepre  pSo in the beginning I provide a 300 width cell. Somehow it got resized into 320. However, everything remains finep  pActually should I provide a 300 width cell or a 320 width cell anywayp  pIt seems that no matter the size of the cell that I provide, the cell itself will be resized to the width of the tableViewCell. I just dont want to handle the subviews layouting when size is resized.p

Using the underlying Java Library I reached a point where I have a hash with the columns specified in the select.p  pNow Id like to use this hash to have ActiveRecord models, but Id like them to look like if I did a classic Model.selectcolumns.all with only the columns values, errors when trying to reach the other ones and readonly.p  pThere must be something inside of AR to do this but I cant find anything and all my search leads to all the basic fetch tutorials ...p

Negative 84138 pMy background is computer science, exclusively in imperative programming CC, Python. Since Im currently struggling with coming up with a formal description for some algorithms for a paper, I was wondering if there is a functional programming language that provides a syntax as close as possible to mathematical notation for example, similar to what EventB is offering see a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comJaXu0.png relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comJaXu0.pnga for a screenshot, but without the overhead State Machines, etc EventB has.p  pMy use case for this is simple Id like to be able to come up with a formula likep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdvsSA.png altformulap  pand enter this, with a syntax as close as possible, into the programming language to evaluate it with different inputs and check if it really does what I expect it to.

Negative 84138 pI have an ASP.NET project created with C that uses GridViews.  The footer row contains a ratio of a total based on the column data over a set value from the data saying how many there should be.  The user needs to be able to modify the second value and have the footer update.  I am not able to find out how to do this or even if it is possible.  I contemplated using another GridView underneath, but ensuring the column lines sync between the two is a nightmare.  Any ideasp  pAlso, when I change the column data using EditUpdate rows, the total is not updated when I click on Update, but does when I click on Edit again.  Can anyone tell me why this is and how to update the total in the footer on Updatingp

Negative 84138 pI have been told, as well as read that using the style attribute in html is considered badsloppypoor form.  Further, that all rendering specific bits should be divorced into css and other parts as appropriate.

Negative 84138 pLooking around this question appears to have been done to death, but i still cant find something suitable for my needs. I would like to time a snippet of my code, and i would like just the CPU execution time ignoring operating system processes etc.p  pIve tried time.clock, it appears too imprecise, and gives a different answer each time In theory surely if i run it again for the same code snippet it should return the same valuep  pIve played with timeit for about an hour. Essentially what kills it for me is the setup process, i end up having to import around 20 functions which is impractical as im practically just rewriting my code into the setup section to try and use it.p  pCprofiles are looking more and more attractive, but do they return CPU time also, a minor point  it outputs way too much information. Is there any way to get the outputted information into a txt or .dat file so i can actually read itp  pCheersp  pOS ubuntu program python 2.7p

Negative 84138 pIn another thread I started a discussion about Vectors and Arrays, in which I was largely playing devils advocate, to push buttons.  However, during the course of this, I stumbled onto a test case that has me a little perplexed, and I would like to have a real discussion about it, over the abuse Im getting for playing devils advocate, starting a real discussion on that thread is now impossible.  However, the particular example has me intrigued, and I cannot explain it to myself satisfactorily. p  pThe discussion is about the general performance of Vector vs Arrays, ignoring dynamic elements.  Ex obviously continually using pushback in a vector is going to slow it down.  Were assuming that the vector and array are prepopulated with data.  The example I presented, and subsequently modified by an individual in the thread, was the followingp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltvectorgt include lttypetraitsgt using namespace std  const int ARRAYSIZE  500000000   httpstackoverflow.coma15975738500104 template ltclass Tgt class noinitallocator  public     typedef T valuetype      noinitallocator noexcept      template ltclass Ugt         noinitallocatorconst noinitallocatorltUgtamp noexcept      T allocatestdsizet n         return staticcastltTgtoperator newn  sizeofT     void deallocateT p, stdsizet noexcept         operator deletestaticcastltvoidgtp     template ltclass Ugt         void constructU noexcept                       libstdc doesnt know istriviallydefaultconstructible, still has the old names             staticassertistriviallydefaultconstructibleltUgtvalue,             This allocator can only be used with trivally default constructible types              template ltclass U, class A0, class...

When you run this test on array sizes that are smaller, the performance differences dissipate dramatically.  p  pMy explanationp  pThe additional implementation instructions for vector are causing the vector instructions to align in memory poorly, perhaps even on this example, a split at a really bad point on 2 different blocks.  This is causing memory to jump back and forth between levels of cache vs data cache vs instruction cache more frequently than you would expect.  I also suspect that the LLVM compiler may be exaggerating weaknesses, and optimizing poorly, due to some of the newer C11 elements, though I have no reason for either of these explanations besides hypothesis and conjecture.  p  pI am interested if A that someone can replicate my results and B if someone has a better explanation for how the computer is running this particular benchmark and why vector is so dramatically underperforming arrays in this instance.  p  pMy set up  a hrefhttpwww.newegg.comProductProduct.aspxItemN82E16834100226httpwww.newegg.comProductProduct.aspxItemN82E16834100226ap

Negative 84138 pI was once asking about a datastructure for A. I solved this issue now. But there is another problem. My A is slow and not working as I expect it. That means  I implemented the source code in Java from the Wikipedia Pseudocodes German and English. The graph below in the image is the graph I used for test purposes. The algorithm is starting from node 1 to the destination node 8 for example. The heuristic function will be calculated by using the Manhattan distance using the coordinates in square brakes next to the node. The closedlist is build from start node 1predecessor to 3163214132234386. I thought the A is going from 1 to 8 directly, because it is the shortest path. But it jumps from 6 back to node 2, because the f value of 2 is the lowest in the list. So is this correct In examples I have seen it never jumps to any other node back, after it visited a node afterwards. I have a graph which is connected from both directions with the other nodes. Therefore I changed the if conditions in the source code to proof if the reverse way is or is not in the corresponding list. Otherwise it would end in an endless loop. What is the problem and why is it jumping from node 6 back to node 2 Do I have to delete the nodes in my openlist img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzCGB6.jpg altenter image description here. p  precodepublic ArrayListltNodeDgt executeAstarArrayListltArclistentrygt data, NodeD start, NodeD dest      openlist  new PriorityQueueltNodeDgt1,comp     closedlist.clear     openlist.offerstart     start.setg0     start.seth manhattendistancestart, dest     start.setfstart.getgstart.geth     whileopenlist.isEmpty              NodeD currentnode  openlist.poll         ifcurrentnode.getnodenumber  dest.getpredessor                      closedlist.addcurrentnode             return closedlist                  closedlist.addcurrentnode         forint i0 ilt data.size i                      ifdata.geti.getstartcurrentnode.getnodenumber                              NodeD successor  new NodeDdata.geti.getnode,data.geti.getstart, data.geti.getcoorddest                 NodeD reversesuccessor  new NodeDdata.geti.getstart,data.geti.getnode,data.geti.getcoordstart                 float tentativeg  currentnode.getgdata.geti.getcost                 ifcontainssuccessor, closedlistcontainsreversesuccessor, closedlistampamptentativeg gtsuccessor.getg                                      continue                                  ifcontainssuccessor, openlist tentativeg lt successor.getg                                      successor.setpredessorcurrentnode.getnodenumber                     successor.setgtentativeg                     successor.sethmanhattendistancesuccessor, dest                     successor.setfsuccessor.getgmanhattendistancesuccessor, dest                     ifcontainssuccessor, openlist                                              openlist.offersuccessor                                                                      ArrayListltNodeDgt ret  null     return ret  codepre

Negative 84138 pWe have a Visual Basic 6 application that connects to a local MS Access mdb file to store some values during work processing. The connection to this file is done via a user DSN ODBC connection. We have determined that the path of the connection is valid. However, occasionally, and at seemingly random times, calls to this mdb file will fail with an ODBC error message that the path is invalid. The path is reported back as null. At other times, we receive a disk or network error message. There does not appear to be any consistency to why or how these errors occur.p  pAre there any registry or configuration values that we should be looking at to determine the source of this problem The file is not disappearing from the server at any point, so we are leaning towards the problem being an ODBC configuration.p  pThe VB application is running under Citrix on a Windows 2003 server 32bit.p
Negative 84138 pIm not sure if this is possible or notp  pI have a webpage with several divs of content on it, stacked one on top of the other. At the bottom, of all the content divs, I want there to be a 100px tall image or maybe its a DIV with a codebackgroundimagecode.p  pWhen you view this page, the browser creates scrollbars so that you can scroll down the content but also so you can scroll the bottom divimage into view.p  pAre there CSS settings I can use on that bottom divimage so that the browser basically ignores it as content So that the browser doesnt try to scroll down to it I cant figure out if this is possible or not.p  pAlternatively, I can make the image part of the codeltbodygtcode background, but then how do I force this image to show up exactly below my content divs  When you change the window size, the height of my content divs change, due to changing content inside of them. So Im not sure how you can always ensure this bottom image shows up exactly after the last content div if its a background.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pHere is a link that can help illustrate what Im trying to do a hrefhttpjsbin.comojejad2edit relnofollowhttpjsbin.comojejad2editap  pWhen you scroll down, the green shows up, because its obviously part of the content of the page. Is it possible for the browser to not consider the green div part of the page content, so that the scrolling stops at the bottom of the bluep  pThe reason for this is that I want people to see the green image at the bottom only if their monitor is big enough that they natually see all the blue  the green without having to scroll. But if the users monitor is too small, I dont want them to scroll to the bottom of the page and continue scrolling just to see this image because its really supposed to be just a background image and not apart of the important content.p

Negative 84138 pIm trying to explore how feasible it is to create an HTML5 interaction where a touch can be conditionally captured by the initial direction of the motion. p  pThe goal is to capture and track the motion of the touch emonlyem if it initially moves in a horizontal direction. Combined with a responsive page layout which only scrolls vertically, we should be able to use horizontal swipe motion to do something cool by tracking it.p  pThe problem is in the seeming impossibility especially on iOS of performing touch sequence capture emconditionallyem. p  pIn order to track a touch and by this I mean specifically obtaining the stream of x,y coordinates which represent the position of the finger over time, codetouchstartcode has to be codepreventDefaultcodeed in order to prevent the page from engaging native momentumscroll. Native momentumscroll, while in operation, suspends all JS execution codesetTimeoutcode, rAF, jQuery codeanimatecode et al... and even CSS keyframeanimationtransition execution. p  pI would really like to know if theres a way to somehow condition the codepreventDefaultcode of the original codetouchstartcode event. Its completely possible for JS to store that event object, and then not call it until some later time when it is determined that we are indeed interested in preventing the native scroll from starting.p  pBut this is certain to fail because the default behavior of not running codepreventDefaultcode on that event is to engage nativescroll, which then will block JS execution for the entire remaining duration of the scroll. Failing to return the event listener function attached to codetouchstartcode does not appear to be an option. It would freeze everything. p  pThe tentative answer, then, without any additional insight, is that all swipes must be captured if we want to be able to capture it at all, and scrolling has to be faked via external means  la iScroll[httpcubiq.orgiscroll5readyforbetatest] personally I would want to explore some sort kind of combination of rAF and codewindow.scrollTocode and would be surprised if iScroll 5 does not employ these APIsp  pIncidentally the description for the 4th demo there got me really excited, but it turns out that all it does is create a page section that iScrolls horizontally while the rest of the page behaves regularly, which is entirely mundane.p

Negative 84138 pI am running external code as a 3rd party extension to a node.js service. The API methods return promises. A resolved promise means the action was carried out successfully,  a failed promise means there was some problem carrying out the operation.p  pNow heres where Im having trouble.p  pSince the 3rd party code is unknown, there could be bugs, syntax errors, type issues, any number of things that could cause node.js to throw an exception.p  pHowever, since all the code is wrapped up in promises, these thrown exceptions are actually coming back as failed promises.p  pI tried to put the function call within a trycatch block, but its never triggeredp  precode worker process var mod  require.3rdpartymodule.js try    mod.run.thenfunction data      sendToClienttrue, data   , function err      sendToClientfalse, err     catch e     unrecoverable error inside of module    ... send signal to restart this worker process ...  codepre  pIn the above psuedocode example, when an error is thrown it turns up in the failed promise function, and not in the catch.p  pFrom what I read, this is a feature, not an issue, with promises.

Negative 84138 pI was wondering if storing objects as serialized data example json in a relational db is ever a good practice. I know it is generally a bad thing, and Im not planning on using it extensively, but I stumbled on a case which got me thinking.p  pSo, here is my situation. Im basically building an mobile ordering system for delivering items from point A to point B. A is starting address, B is destination... both are current GPS coordinates of users alongside with readable data like street name, street number etc.p  pThese are the requirementsp  ul lieach order has a starting addressli lidestination address is optionalli lionce the order is created and addresses along with it, addresses will never be updatedli lieach order stores a new set of addresses, meaning if there are more orders from the same address, previously saved address will not be reusedli liI dont need any queries on address data, like filtering, sorting ...li listructure of address data if fixed. I know this is where serialization has its advantages, but I will certainly not need it.li ul  pSo, the dilemma is whether to use a separate table for address data columns id, street, street number, lat, lng..., or to simply store addresses as JSON stringsp  pThe only down side with JSON, that I see, is that the data has to be serializeddeserialized. Since it has just a few fields it cant make much of a difference.p  pOn the other hand there are a few things I dont like with separate tablep  ul liit could have millions of rows which are needed only for display purposesli liit is easier to monitor data if everything is in one tableli lithe data is needed wherever information about the order is displayed, so I would need to join those 2 tables all the timeli lihighly unlikely, but theoretically, I could run out of autoincremented idsli ul  pI guess I cant go much wrong with a standard relational approach and store addresses in a separate table, but I just cant see any real advantage in it.p

Negative 84138 pI am looking for how to share functions and data across multiple activities within a single application.  I researched the daylights out of it and find some ideology war between overriding the extend for the application and doing a singleton, neither of which I can find examples sufficient to make me understand.  Basically I want to share data and share functions.  All activities need the same functions and data so this is not one activity sharing data with another activity.  It is all activities needing to have access to the same functions and data.p  pWhat I want to know is what is the way to go and how do I do it.  I need to see what I need to do in my 34 activities, what the class that is going to be common looks like, and what the Manifest entry needs to be.  I also need to be sure the common data area will not be closed by the OS.p  pThis is my first Android  Java program and now find my 15,000 line, 34 activity application needs some structure.  I know, should have done things differently but the app works really well with two exceptions.  One is that it is structurally a mess.  Two is that the fact it is a mess is making it hard to fix one behavior I would like to fix.  p  pThis is a GPS based application for racing sailboats.  It is timing critical and every activity basically runs a once a second loop inside the location manager onLocationChanged function.  That part is fine and I do not want to put the GPS code in one place.  The problem is that most activities need to filter the data so a lot of code is copied and pasted to the activities.  The filter needs history so it needs to remember a state.  There are other functions that are used by several activities so these have been copied as well.  Think of a function that averages the last three GPS speed readings.  It needs to save some history, do its thing, and give a result. All activities need to do the exact same thing. All this works but the problem is that the averaging starts over every time I switch activities because every activity has its own filter.  That gives a glitch in the data that I need to get rid of.  I need common place to save the data and hopefully a common place to run the filtering and other functions that are common. If every activity can call the filter function that is using common state data, there will be no glitch across activity changes.p  pI would appreciate some guidance.p

I can see several ways to do this in C too, but none of them seem particularily nice.

Negative 84138 pIn a regular DLL, theres generally a 11 mapping of entry points and functions in the DLL.  I have a DLL that has about 50 functions.

MixItUps built in filter button handlers are best            suited to simple filter operations, so we will need to build our own handlers            for this demo to achieve the precise behaviour we need.                   var filters  filters.findli,             dimensions                   asignatura all,  Create string for first dimension                 format all  Create string for second dimension                        Bind checkbox click handlers          filters.onclick,function             var t  this,                 dimension  t.attrdatadimension,                 filter  t.attrdatafilter,                 filterString  dimensions[dimension]              iffilter  all                  If all                 ift.hasClassactive                      if unchecked, check all and uncheck all other active filters                     t.addClassactive.siblings.removeClassactive                      Replace entire string with all                     filterString  all                     else                       Uncheck                     t.removeClassactive                      Emtpy string                     filterString                                 else                   Else, uncheck all                 t.siblings[datafilterall].removeClassactive                  Remove all from string                 filterString  filterString.replaceall,                 ift.hasClassactive                      Check checkbox                     t.addClassactive                      Append filter to string                     filterString  filterString    filter  filterString filter                  else                       Uncheck                     t.removeClassactive                      Remove filter and preceeding space from string with RegEx                     var re  new RegExpsfilter                     filterString  filterString.replacere,                                             Set demension with filterString             dimensions[dimension]  filterString               We now have two strings containing the filter arguments for each dimension               console.infodimension 1 dimensions.asignatura             console.infodimension 2 dimensions.format                              We then send these strings to MixItUp using the filter method.

Negative 84138 pI am trying to figure out the most optimal way to compute a topk query on some aggregation of data, lets say an array. I used to think the best way was to run through the array and maintain a heap or balanced binary tree of size k, leveraging that to compute the topk value. Now, I have run across the Selection Algorithm which supposedly runs even faster. I understand how the Selection Algorithm works and how to implement it, I am just a little confused as to how it runs in On. I feel like in order for it to run in On you would have to be extremely lucky. If you keep picking a random pivot point and partitioning around it, it could very well be the case that you just end up basically sorting almost the entire array before stumbling upon your kth index. Are there any optimizations such as maybe not picking a random pivot Or is my maintaining a heaptree method good enough for most cases.p

Negative 84138 pI am trying a quick prototype project to see if what I want to do with Mapbox iOS SDK routeme and iOS MapKit is possible.p  pI would like to see if I can have the best of both worlds with MapBoxs offline capability and extras like clustering but also still use the iOS map types.  After some research and help on SO I found that Mapbox and iOS maps do not work together, you get to pick one or the other.  I started to wonder what would happen if I lay a RMMapView mapbox map directory on top of the iOS map.  Then in instances when I want to see the iOS map I could just set the RMMapViews basemap to transparent such that the iOS map directly beneath it would show through.  Again two fold, you could use iOS maps if you wanted but I could also keep the mapbox markers drawn such that when you switch to the iOS map you do not need to redraw markers.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5kI1g.png altenter image description herep  pBasically I have created a main view Super View and added two subviews MKMapView and RMMapView, with RMMapView on top.  I have already figured out how to make the base layer on the RMMapView transparent, and I can even add RMMarkers and they show nicely laid on top of the MKMapView.p  pMy problem is with touch events and gestures.  If I do this I need all touches and gestures that happen on the RMMapView, to still happen on the RMMapView but also happen on the MKMapView.  I.E. if the base map on RMMapView is transparent but there is a marker in that view, when I scroll the map I need the RMMapView to move such that the marker moves along with the MKMapView.p  pWhat I have triedp  ol liOverride hitTest.  Problem with this approach is that once you do this the touch will only operate on the view you return.  I need the touch to happen on both the RMMapView and the MKMapView.li liCreated a gesture recognizer in my Super View.  I then try to pass the touches on to both of my sub views.  Really, really though this might work.  But there are a couple problems from what I can tell.  First I know both map views have scroll views on top of them so forwarding the touch to the MKMapView and RMMapView does not work. I think I would have to forward the touch to each maps scroll view.li ol  pSo I dont think 1 would ever work, and I cannot get 2 to work.  Anyone ever tried to do anything like this.  Can 2 different view act on the same touch events or does the first view that gets the event winp  pMy design may be wrong too so if anyone has another suggestion please throw it out.  Do realize though that I would like to stay away from modifying RMMapView, and cannot really mod MKMapView.p  pMost relevant post I could find was this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1049889howtointercepttoucheseventsonamkmapvieworuiwebviewobjectsHow to intercept touches events on a MKMapView or UIWebView objectsa.  But I dont want to intercept events on the MKMapView, I want to intercept them on the SuperView such that I can pass to both its sup views.p  pThanksp

Negative 84138 pI have written some code to comb through approximately 10000 web pages on a website to put together a profile of the user demographics on the website.  The basis of the program is to read each line of the source code of the website, parse out the data wanted, then move onto the next page.  p  pI am encountering an issue where around the 650th page or so, the program goes from reading around 3 pages per second to 1 page per 1015 seconds.  It always occurs at the same point of the program execution.  I began wondering if this might be a memory issue with my program and begin to check each aspect of it.  Eventually I stripped the program down to its basicsp  pStep 1 Create an array of URL objects.p  pStep 2 Loop through the array and openclose a buffered reader to read each line.p  pStep 3 Read the entire page and move onto the next line.  p  pEven this slowed down in the exact spot, so this isnt a problem with the data I am parsing or where I am storing it.  It is a result of this loop somehow.  I am wondering if there is a memory issue with what I have written that is causing issues  Otherwise my only guess is somehow I am making calls too quickly to the website servers and it is intentionally slowing me down.  p  pObviously not the best written code, as I am new and subject to a bunch of sloppy coding.

I hope this makes a little sense if you want more info just ask. p  pUPDATE this is what i got so farp  precode    ltscriptgt          function startTracking               var startPos                var coords  []               Reused code  copyright Moveable Type Scripts  retrieved May 4,2010.              httpwww.movabletype.co.ukscriptslatlong.html              Under Creative Commons License httpcreativecommons.orglicensesby3.0              function calculateDistancelat1, lon1, lat2, lon2                  var R  6371000  m                 var dLat  lat2lat1.toRad                 var dLon  lon2lon1.toRad                 var a  Math.sindLat2  Math.sindLat2                          Math.coslat1.toRad  Math.coslat2.toRad                          Math.sindLon2  Math.sindLon2                 var c  2  Math.atan2Math.sqrta, Math.sqrt1a                 var d  R  c                 return d.toFixed2                  Number.prototype.toRad  function                  return this  Math.PI  180                  if navigator.geolocation                  watchID  navigator.geolocation.watchPositionfunctionposition                      currentLat  position.coords.latitude                     currentLon  position.coords.longitude                      coords.push[currentLat, currentLon]                      console.logcoords                  , functionerror                      alertError occurred.

Negative 84138 pIm working on a custom number pad and am having an issue with the background image of the UIButtons.  Everything appears to work as it should but occasionally during push animations the buttons flicker white in between each other.  This most often happens when popping a view controller to a view with the numberpad.  When I change the background color of their enclosing view to something radical like green then the flicker is green, so it seems like somehow the background is showing through.  This is even more pronounced and reproducible every time with a double click on the home button.  Please see the screenshots for a reference of what things look like when I do it.

Im not sure what Im doing wrong, but it appears as a warning on eclipse, and I think it might be whats making my function behave differently than it should. The comments and variables are in portuguese, so if you need me to translate any part of it, or to tell you what each function should do, just tell me. please I really need help on this ASAP.p

Negative 84138 pFor fun, and to learn functional programming, Im developing a program in Clojure that does algorithmic composition using ideas from this theory of music called Westergaardian Theory. It generates lines of music where a line is just a single staff consisting of a sequence of notes, each with pitches and durations. It basically works like thisp  ol liStart with a line consisting of three notes the specifics of how these are chosen are not important.li liRandomly perform one of several operations on this line. The operation picks randomly from all pairs of adjacent notes that meet a certain criteria for each pair, the criteria only depends on the pair and is independent of the other notes in the line. It inserts 1 or several notes depending on the operation between the chosen pair. Each operation has its own, unique criteria.li liContinue randomly performing these operations on the line until the line is the desired length. li ol  pThe issue Ive run into is that my implementation of this is quite slow, and I suspect it could be made faster. Im new to Clojure and functional programming in general though Im experienced with OO, so Im hoping someone with more experience can point out if Im not thinking in a functional paradigm or missing out on some FP technique.p  pMy current implementation is that each line is a vector containing maps. Each map has a note and a dur. notes value is a keyword representing a musical note like A4 or C3. durs value is a fraction, representing the duration of the note 1 is a whole note, 14 is a quarter note, etc.... So, for example, a line representing the C major scale starting on C3 would look like thisp  precode[ note C3 dur 1 note D3 dur 1 note E3 dur 1 note F3 dur 1 note G3 dur 1 note A4 dur 1 note B4 dur 1 ] codepre  pLets ignore the problem of using a vector a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq24131932765419thats covered in a different questiona. I want to focus on improving the speed of figuring out which pairs of notes pass the criteria for a given operation.p  pThe problem is, each operation has to see which adjacent note pairs meet its criteria. Currently, this is On where n is the size of the line it simply steps through the entire line and looks at each pair, which means even if I fix the issue of using a vector it would still be slow. However, the nice thing about the criteria check is that it only has to reevaluate notes whose neighbors have changed since the criteria for each pair is independent of the other notes in the line. Im not sure how I would keep track of this in Clojure, so that the algorithm would track which pairs were dirty and which were clean, and be able to only reevaluate note pairs that were dirty. Would it be okay, paradigmwise, to keep track of that using a map to enclose the line, and adding metadata For example, I would have a structure like thisp  precode line [ltthe elements of the linegt] dirty [ltindexes of notes that need to be recheckedgt] valid         operation1 [ltindexes of notes that operation 1 can be performed ongt]        operation2 [ltindexes of notes that operation 2 can be performed ongt]        ...          codepre  pHow could I do something like that but make it a nice abstraction Like, so I wouldnt have to remember how the thing was structured every time I wanted to do stuff to it. Is there some Clojure language feature that would be useful for abstracting this Or is this not a good way to do it Im thinking about how easy it is in OO to abstract away implementation details like this for example, if I want to say that a given note is now dirty I can do something like .setDirtyindex instead of accessing the vector directly. Im sure theres ways to do this in Clojurefunctional programming. p  pDoes this seem like a decent way to track dirty notes How might I code this in Clojure to make it easy to use making a nice abstraction so I dont have to remember how the map is structured.p

Negative 84138 pIn my app, I have a page view controller that allows the user to swipe between different sections of the app, and at the top in the nav bar I change the title text to the new section the user has swiped to via codepageViewControllerdidFinishAnimatingpreviousViewControllerstransitionCompletedcode. It is currently instantly changing the title text when the animation has completed. I would like to improve this with some animation, a subtle fading in and out effect. p  pI first tried to implement code[UIView animationWithDuration...]code to animate changing the title text, but it does not animation and simply still updates instantly.p  pI then wondered if itd be possible to update the alpha of the nav bar title as the user scrolls horizontally based on how far theyve scrolled, reaching 0 alpha when the next section is about to come on screen, then I can instantly change the text while its at 0 and then quickly fade in to 1 alpha. But I dont see a method on codeUIPageViewControllerDelegatecode that is called when the scroll position has updated.p  pIf possible, instead of just fading in and out, I could fade as well as move the title text position in the nav bar like the default animation that occurs when navigating back from a push segue via a swipe gesture. I would slide the old section title over as the user scrolls and provide the next section title on the other side, so that when the transition completes the previous section title is off screen and the new one is perfectly centered so the replacement completes. But again this requires knowing exactly how much the user has scrolled the page view controller.p  pIs it possible to implement any of the desired animationsp

Negative 84138 pI have a dll that has a static method that clients call to log some information to various destinations. This method uses the ThreadPool to start the logging work on another thread. I need a way to reliably ensure these threads complete before the process exits. The AppDomains ProcessExit event is not available in the 3.5 CF, so wherehow could I reliably wait for these threads to finish The only solution I can think of is to make the threads foreground threads the work on the threads is small and finite, but it has been suggested in other SO answers that this is bad form  but without qualification so not sure why.p

That seemed like a good idea, until we realized that Cloudfront would request each thumbnail to our Heroku application one time for each geographical location.p  pMy question here is this what is the best process, in such an environment Heroku, Rails, Dragonfly, S3Cloudfront, to generate thumbnails and have them servedcached from a Cloudfront CDN p

Negative 84138 pSpawning lots of threads is never a good idea and when you create too many, you may run out of memory anyway.p  pUsually, Jersey needs to create one thread per request.

But as the response may take some time to arrive I calculate up to 30 seconds, the total number of threads can reach several thousands easily at which point, a JVM process usually crashes. Moreover, its just insane to create so many threads. It should actually be a piece of cake for the available processornetworkOSresources to deal with that load.p  pSo what Id like to do, is to just fire off the requests  and be informed by the OS, when the HTTP response arrives. p  ul liAs said above, simply using codetarget.request....async....codedoesnt do the trick because then, Jersey just spawns its own threads.li liAlso, limiting the number of threads via codenew ClientConfig.propertyClientProperties.ASYNCTHREADPOOLSIZE, 10code is not helpful at all, because it means, that at most 10 requests will be sent at a time, which is clearly not what I want it would just pileup the queue.li ul  pI experimented with codenew ClientConfig.connectorProvidernew GrizzlyConnectorProvidercodeto get NIO support  but didnt see any difference in behaviour at all.p  pSo is there any way to fire off a request without having to create one extra thread per requestp

Negative 84138 pIm writing my first Cake app and trying to set up my first deep association. Its very nearly working but I have a couple of small issues.p  pSo I created a form to add a customer. A customer has many addresses and an address has many contacts. The issue I have is that the Form helper doesnt seem to recognise the contact fields for formatting purposes. However, if I perform a find in the action the form displays correctly. Its like the model isnt linking until its used. p  precodeHeres the 3 models  class Customer extends AppModel      public hasMany  CustomerAddress   class CustomerAddress extends AppModel      public belongsTo  Customer     public hasMany  CustomerContact   class CustomerContact extends AppModel      public belongsTo  CustomerAddress  codepre  pUntil its submitted, the add action basically does nothing so I wont bother posting that, but heres some extracts from the viewp  precodeadd.ctp  echo thisgtFormgtinputCustomerAddress.0.CustomerContact.title, options gt array Mr gt Mr, Miss gt Miss, Mrs gt Mrs, Ms gt Ms, Dr gt Dr.n echo thisgtFormgtinputCustomerAddress.0.CustomerContact.first.n echo thisgtFormgtinputCustomerAddress.0.CustomerContact.last.n .....  echo thisgtFormgtinputCustomerAddress.address1.n echo thisgtFormgtinputCustomerAddress.address2.n .....  echo thisgtFormgtinputtype, array label gt Business Customer.n codepre  pSo, the CustomerAddress fields work fine, they are the right type, limited length etc to match the database, but the CustomerContact fields arent working at all. Likewise, if I submit invalid data, the add action does a saveAll and fails, but the form fields are then displayed correctly. p  pIf I add a find to the action before the page is displayed, they work fine. Its like the Model isnt being included until its used. p  pIm sure theres probably a simple command to get it to read the models or something but Im a bit stuck with it. p
Negative 84138 pA couple of months ago, Id come across a Javascript libraryframework that claimed to be a new style of blockbased blogging. Basically what it did was allow you to write pages of information assumedly a blogpost as blocks of content i.e. one block for an image, one block for text and so on. Each block was independent of all others, except with respect to positioning. You could have as many blocks of any given type. A wireframe of the what Im talking about is shown below. Ive assumed that ive already added an image and a block of text.p  pimg srchttpsi.imgur.comOoq8IZK.pngp  pPersonally, I thought it was a pretty cool tumblresque framework. It was WYSIWYG without exactly being WYSIWYG. Does anyone know what the name of the libraryframework is Also, is there any similar library or framework available for doing the samep  pHelp much appreciatedp

Negative 84138 pComing from C background myself, it takes some time to get used to C. In C, one uses the dot operator . more often than the operator the namespace qualifier operator in C, to access namespace and class scopes.p  pIn C, one uses the dot operator . to access members of an instance of a class. Scope resolution operator  on the other hand, is used to access members of a class without an instance of that class. To me, this makes sense and is both logical and consistent.p  pWhile I can accept different approach used in C, there seems to be at least one instance, in which I see an inconsistence. At least, that is how it appears to me. It has to do with the global keywordp  precodeglobalSystem.Console.WriteLineHello World codepre  pCould somebody explain to me why namespace alias qualifier is required to use with global keyword instead of the dot operatorp

Negative 84138 pIm working on a large C project under Visual Studio 2010 and think that there are some memory leaks inside. I tried the approach with including crtdbg.h but it does not help much as I dont see where the leaks occured. Defining new has 2 pitfalls First it needs to be done in every cpp file which is not really an option, and 2nd it breaks with e.g. Boost. Using newnothrow or anything that uses boosts hasnewoperator.h breaks this. [EDIT It fails to compile as the redefined new has no overloads for something like nothrow or the boost magic] Unless one defines new after all boost headers including headers referencing boostp  pLast but not least I have singletons. They are implemented using subclasses of the singleton template and a static function variable. One of them is a config container where one registers settings pairs of strings and ints that are than stored in maps Since the mem leak dump is called before deallocation of the singleton instance I get a massive amount of leaks for all those strings and the singleton itself.p  pAny way to have only the real leaks shown or make it dump after static object deallocationp  pWhich free tools can handle this casep

Negative 84138 pHas anyone found a way to either force a Powershell TLS client to not use SNI, or to continue with a connection past an SNI error from the serverp  pIm trying to make a powershell script download a big list of networks from our DHCP server, and format it for import into another system.p  pI can download the data with a browser  watching the connection with Wireshark, I see the browser start the TLS handshake, send an SNI indication, the server respond with a TLS Alert Level Warning, Description Unrecognized Name, the browser continue with the TLS connection unfazed, and the download succeeds.p  pTo debug the requests, I ran the connection through a local proxy burp suite, which is a Java app, so I could see both the encrypted tunnel, and the content of the HTTP request.  This caused the connection to fail and the proxy to immediately return an error.  Apparently Java TLS code is unwilling to continue to connect past the TLS error that browsers take in stride.  If I force the proxy not to include Server Name Identification SNI in the request, it works see the commentedout debug code below.p  pFinally, removing the proxy from the mix, it seems the network code Powershell uses is also unwilling to continue past the error  it sends the same SNI indicator, receives the same TLS error, and then just hangs  no more packets are exchanged until 100 seconds have passed, then the connection is closed with a FIN packet, and Powershells returns a timeout errorp  pcodeException calling DownloadFile with 2 arguments The operation has timed outcodep  pThe code Im using is thisp  precodewebclient  newobject System.Net.WebClient  DEBUG for now  send requests through proxy  proxy  newobject System.Net.WebProxy proxy.Address  httplocalhost8080 webclient.proxy  proxy   have to do this to ignore invalid certs from proxy [System.Net.ServicePointManager]ServerCertificateValidationCallback  true  Also have to force the JRE running the proxy to not send SNI in the request  invoke as java Djsse.enableSNIExtensionfalse jar cUsersMarkSBurpburpsuiteprov1.6.09.jar  end DEBUG  server       input  ReadHost server to connect to [ourDHCPservername]     ifinput input else ourDHCPservername   currentid  [Environment]Username userid       input  ReadHost user ID to connect as [currentid]     ifinput input else currentid   password  ReadHost AsSecureString password to connect with  pscreds  newobject System.Management.Automation.PSCredentialuserid,password webclient.Credentials  newobject System.Net.NetworkCredentialuserid, pscreds.GetNetworkCredential.Password  connect...  tempfile  [System.IO.Path]GetTempFileName tempfile  ...and download NOTE  dont use XML  server returns badly malformed XML url  httpsserverwapiv1.2.1networkmaxresults10000000ampreturntypejsonprettyampreturnfields2Bextattrs   webclient.DownloadFileurl, tempfile codepre  pThanks very muchp

Negative 84138 pWhenever you have an element with its codedisplaycode property set to codenonecode, and you try to strongtrigger a transition so that it fades instrong, it jumps quickly to full opacity, unless you add a timeout. Do you have any idea of how to get around this The timeout works, kinda, but not as well as I would like. Heres what I havep  precodefadeIn functionspeed      var len  this.length,         speed  speed  1000,         transitionString  opacity   speed  ms     while len           el  this[len] this is an object containing DOM elements          function motherLoopel, len               setTimeoutfunction                    el.style.display  block                  el.style.transition  transitionString                  el.style.opacity  0                      timeout needed for transition to trigger...                  function babyLoopel, len                      setTimeoutfunction                           el.style.opacity  1                         iflen babyLoopel, len                     , 10                 el, len                   function transitionEnd                       el.removeEventListenertransitionend, transitionEnd                     el.style.opacity                       el.style.transition                                     el.addEventListenertransitionend, transitionEnd                 iflen motherLoopel, len             , 50          el, len          return this    codepre  pAs you can see, it is really messy code, but so far the timeout has been the only thing I find that works. This only happens if the element has its display set to none, though. And its sometimes set to none because I have another method that hides given element. As you can see, I first set the emhiddenem element to codedisplay blockcode, I add the CSS transition, set its codeopacitycode to code0code and then to code1code. It is when switching to codeopacity 1code that the timeout is crucial for the transition to trigger. Is there anything you can see that Im doing wrong p  pWhat Id like to do, specifically, is not rely on the timeouts, because they dont work well the transition still doesnt trigger sometimes, and because they dont seem natural. As a side effect, Id like to learn why this happens, if you could help. Thank you. p

Negative 84138 pI am writing a C program to read data from an SSD drive by reading directly from the raw block device file.p  pI am trying the Linux AIO I am talking about the Linux AIO API, i.e. the functions provided by codelinuxaio.hcode, such as codeiosubmit...code etc., not the POSIX AIO API. I open the block device file using the codeODIRECTcode flag and I make sure that I write to buffers are aligned to block size.p  pI noticed that Linux AIO it is considerably faster than using syncronous IO also with codeODIRECTcode flag.p  pThe thing that surprised me the most is that the throughput achieved by issuing many small random reads of few KBs each with Linux AIO is remarkably higher even than the throughput achieved doing a large sequential read of few MBs using synchronous IO and codeODIRECTcode.p  pSo, I would like to know how come Linux AIO peforms that better than syncronous IO What does the kernel do when AIO is used Does the kernel perform request reordering Does using Linux AIO result in greater CPU utilization than using synchronous IOp  pThanks a lot in advancep

Negative 84138 pIn my layout, I have a textview which I need to be fixed at the top of the screen, a button to be fixed at the bottom of the screen.  Between these two, I have a list with a textviewwith a drawable below it. please see image. I want the textview positioned below the listi.e. as list items grow, the textview should reposition itself. As I click on the textview, I add items to the list. I am able to achieve this, but as my list items increase, the textview goes below the list amp is not visible. So what I see on screen is the top textview with the list below it amp the bottom button. The textview to add items in list view is not visible, so I cannot add items to my list. I need that even if the list items increase, I want the list to be visible along with the textview.i.e. strongas list items grow, the textview should reposition itselfstrong. I tried various approaches suggested with several combinations of linear amp relative layouts amp positioning techniques, but I am not able to achieve this. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5nPFh.png altenter image description herep

Negative 84138 pI have been playing with Munin lately v2.0.25 and would like to use it with a virtual host in apache. p  pI have read the docs that go through using apache as a reverse proxy, but I figure, since the munin graphs are built into a folder in the web root, i can make a virtual host that uses that as the doc root, and treat is as a subdomain. p  pThis works as expected, no problems. However I noticed that the munin apache.conf file seems to be symlinked to the apache availableconf dir at install time, and so this is still active, meaning there are two URLs which will point to the same content. My solution to this was simple and brutal  delete the symlinks, and again, it works. But there has to be a cleaner way, right A config setting ive missed p

Negative 84138 pBefore anyone starts saying I havent searched well enough, trust me I have and there is nothing on this, its a brand new issue..lol.p  pSo long story short I have a dgv that gets data from a mysql database and I can make changes to the data in the grid and save back to the table, no problem except this Changes made by the user on the dgv are not done directly or manually on the dgv, rather the user clicks plus or minus buttons and I pragmatically increase or decrease the number in a certain field called Quantity which is actually the only field that can be updated.p  pNow when I update my adapte command ...da.Updateds, salesDet, the row I changed last does not get updated unless I manually leave that row to another row before pressing the update button. So for instance if I have 3 rows in the dgv and I select row 2 which has a quantity of 1, then I press the plus button, the quantity changes to 2. Then if I immediately press my update button while still on row 2, it will not get updated to my database. It will only work if prior to pressing the update button I leave row 2 to say row 1 or 3. Kind of like because Im changing the numbers programmatically and not manually, I need to leave the edited row for an afterupdate commitment of the new values to fire Dont know if Im making sense but Im really lostp  pI have tried dgv.EndEdit, dgv.RefreshEdit, dgv.Refresh before updating but none of that works.p  pThanks for your helpp

If that is the case, I could use resource.getrusage to figure out the memory usage from a few sample jobs, estimated the distribution myself, and use a fixed cap.

Example  p  p742015 74004.000000 AM 0000 turns into 742015 124004.000000 AM 0000 with an update statement like thisp  precodeUpdate Tablename  set FIELDTIMESTAMP  totimestamp07042015 74004 AM, mmddyyyy hhmiss AM at time zone UTC where ID  201924 codepre  pI have tried just inserting a basic date, I have tried using different variations of the time zone.  Nothing works, it always converts the timestamp. p  pHow can I indicate to Oracle that the timestamp Im updating is UTC and not USCentral time zone so it doesnt convert it p
Negative 84138 pI am working in Excel 2013 and am having some trouble.  I have researched online all day and cant seem to find anything that solves my problem.  p  pI have an Excel document that consists of 6 sheets Format Summary 1.1 Detail 1.2 Detail 1.3 Detail 1.4 Detailp  pThe detail sheets are formatted all the same.  The Summary sheet rolls up all the values from the details sheets and has all kinds of charts and useful information in it.  The format sheet is what I created to try to make this document more dynamic and useful for all different kinds of projects.  This document is being used for estimating projects, so different projects are going to have different amounts of details sheets. p  pSO, my goal is to have a blank in the format sheet that asks how many details are needed.  When the user types in 5, the code will add a sheet named 1.5 Detail to the end of the workbook and have it formatted the same as the other details sheets.  Is this possible using VBA Also, is there a way to make the charts and formulas include the new tab when it is added without manually going and adding it to everythingp  pThanks in advancep
