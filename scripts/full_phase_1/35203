Narrowing the issue down has lead to what I suspect to be a bug in CLR implementation on iOS.p  pIf you have a class codeMyNetworkStreamcode derived from codeNetworkStreamcode which overrides its methods, iOS version may call codeMyNetworkStreamscode codeEndReadcode when the caller assumes that codebase.EndReadcode should be called.

Interestingly that codebase.BeginReadcode is OK, only codebase.EndReadcode is a problem. I.e. codeTask.Factory.FromAsynccode picks the correct value for Begin method but not for End counterpart as the first one is just codeIAsyncResultcode while second one is Func.

Positive 35203 pI was excited to learn that Apple added tracking of deletes in HealthKit in iOS 9.  So I set up a test project to try it out.  Unfortunately, while I can get new data just fine, I am not getting any deleted objects in my callbacks.p  pI have a functioning HKAnchoredObjectQuery that tracks HKQueryAnchor and gives me new HKSamples whenever I add a BloodGlucose quantity into HealthKit via the Health app.  However when I delete that same quantity and rerun the app the HKDeletedObject is always empty.

But additions work fine only getting the added samples since the last anchor.  p  pHere is my code.  It is just 2 files.  To recreate the project just make a new swift project, give yourself the HealthKit Entitlement, and copy these in.  Note When you run it, you only get one update for each run so if you make changes in HealthKit you have to stop and restart the app to test the callbacks.p  pThis is my HealthKit clientp  precode

Negative 35203 pI often find myself trying to come up with good names for complementary pairs of variables where two variables denote opposing concepts, two participants in some sort of duologue, and so on.p  pThis might be better explained by a counterexample  I maintain an app that prints two graphics as part of a print advertisement. Theyre stored in the database as codeTopLogocode and codeLowerLogocode, which I have to stop and doublecheck every time I use them because Im expecting codetopcode to complement codebottomcode, and codelowercode should complement codeuppercode. p  pTheres some obvious examples that I think work wellp  pcodeclient  servercodebr  codesource  targetcode for copyingmoving data or files from one variable to anotherbr  codeminimum  maximumcode  p  pbut theres some concepts that just dont lend themselves to such neat naming schemes.

Negative 35203 pWe use the ExpressionEngine CMS php to create websites. For each site, we set up a subversion repository and commit the EE installation as well as any custom templates, images, javascript, etc. that are used. Included in the repository is the file containing all of the environment variables and the .htaccess file.p  pWe have a development server with a working copy of the repository updated via postcommit that we use to develop. When we are ready to release we create a branch in subversion, make any changes required for the production environment, tag the release number, export the repository, upload it to a new directory on the live server, and symlink the files into place. A rollback is as simple as symlinking back to the previous release.p  pThe problem is that step where we have to modify the environment variables that need to be different for the dev and production servers. This is stuff like uncommenting htaccess rules that would redirect to the wrong places, swapping out google map API keys because the domains are different, running scripts that minimize the javascript into one obfuscated file to keep the size and http connections down, etc.p  pThe question is how could this be more automated We would love to get the release procedure down to the bare minimum. Im familiar with the existence of tools such as Capistrano and Make but Im not sure how I could get them to modify all the files necessary... how would you organize such a thing Is this worth spending time automating when it happens maybe once every couple of weeksp

Negative 35203 pI dont know how else to say it so Im just going to explain my ideal scenario and hopefully you can explain to me how to implement it...p  pIm creating an application with the Zend Framework that will be hosted with DreamHost. The application will be hosted on its own domain i.e. exampleapp.com. Basically, a user should be able to sign up, get their own domain sampleuser.exampleapp.com or exampleapp.comsampleuser which points to, what looks like their own instance of the app, which is really a single instance serving up different content based on the url.p  pEventually, I want my users to be able to create their own domain like foobar.com that points to sampleuser.exampleapp.com, such that visitors to foobar.com dont notice that the site is really being served up from exampleapp.com.p  pI dont know how to do most of that stuff. How does this process work Do I need to do some funky stuff with Apache or can this be done with a third party host, like DreamHostp  pstrongUpdatestrong Thanks for the advice Ive decided to bite the bullet and upgrade my hosting plan to utilize wildcard subdomains. Its cheaper than I was expecting I also found out about domain reseller programs, like opensrs.com, that have their own API.

Negative 35203 pThis question relates to those parts of the KenKen Latin Square puzzles which ask you to find all possible combinations of ncells numbers with values x such that 1 lt x lt maxval and x1  ...  xncells  targetsum.  Having tested several of the more promising answers, Im going to award the answerprize to Lennart Regebro, becausep  ol liphis routine is as fast as mine 5, andpli liphe pointed out that my original routine had a bug somewhere, which led me to see what it was really trying to do.  Thanks, Lennart.pli ol  pchrispy contributed an algorithm that seems equivalent to Lennarts, but 5 hrs later, sooo, first to the wire gets it.p  pA remark  Alex Martellis barebones recursive algorithm is an example of making every possible combination and throwing them all at a sieve and seeing which go through the holes.  This approach takes 20 times longer than Lennarts or mine.  Jack up the input to maxval  100, ncells  5, targetsum  250 and on my box its 18 secs vs. 8 mins.  Moral  Not generating every possible combination is good.p  pAnother remark Lennarts and my routines generate strongthe same answers in the same orderstrong.  Are they in fact the same algorithm seen from different angles  I dont know.p  pSomething occurs to me.  If you sort the answers, starting, say, with 8,8,2,1,1 and ending with 4,4,4,4,4 what you get with maxval8, ncells5, targetsum20, the series forms kind of a slowest descent, with the first ones being hot and the last one being cold and the greatest possible number of stages in between.  Is this related to informational entropy  Whats the proper metric for looking at it Is there an algorithm that producs the combinations in descending or ascending order of heat  This one doesnt, as far as I can see, although its close over short stretches, looking at normalized std. dev.p  pHeres the Python routinep  precodeusrbinenv python filename makeAddCombos.07.py  stripped for StackOverflow  def initializecombo maxval, ncells, targetsum     returns combo     Starting from left, fills combo to maxval or an intermediate value from 1 up.

Negative 35203 pIve been trying to modify a rich text field to display correctly in its half of the horizontal field. The goal is thisp  precode  address is    very long    IMAGE   state, zip    codepre  pWhere address is a single string separate from the city and zip. I am modifying the address field like thisp  precodeRichTextField addrField  new RichTextFieldaddress      public int getPreferredWidth        return 200            protected void layoutint maxWidth,int maxHeight       super.layoutgetPreferredWidth,maxHeight      setExtentgetPreferredWidth, getHeight       codepre  pThe results look like thisp  precode  address is ve   state, zip     IMAGE                   codepre  pwhere clearly the address is just going under the image. Both horizontal fields are static 200 pixels wide. Its not like the system wouldnt know where to wrap the address. However, I have heard it is not easy to do this and is not done automatically.p  pI have had no success finding a direct answer online. I have found people saying you need to do it in a custom layout manager, some refer to the RichTextField API, which is of no use. But nobody actually mentions how to do it.p  pI understand that I may need to read character by character and set where the line breaks should happen. What I dont know is how exactly to do any of this. You cant just count characters and assume each is worth 5 pixels, and you shouldnt have to.  Surely there must be some way to achieve this in a way that makes sense.p  pAny suggestionsp
Negative 35203 pIm doing some benchmarking on large data sources and bindingexporting data for reporting.p  pI started with using a data set, filling it with 100000 rows and then attempting to open a crystal report with the retrieved data.  I noticed that the data set filled just fine took about 779 milliseconds however, when attempting to export the data to the report or even bind to a gridview the application would fail with an OutOfMemoryException.p  pDoes anyone experienced this before or have an idea of how to get around it  It is very possible that clients will run reports for years worth of data and 100000 rows are not inconceivable.p  pThe application and the benchmark code are written in C using ORACLE and SQL Server databases.  I still have some data sources to test, but would like to know how to get around this just in case I dont find a better solution.p  pPLEASE BE AWARE THIS IS FOR REPORTING NOT ACTUAL GRID VIEW.p

Negative 35203 pThis is intended to be more of a discussion than an outright question, hence Ive made it community wiki.  When do you choose to break a method into smaller methods. p  pSay I have a method that has one purpose, i.e. to load a configuration filep  precodepublic function configurefile     info  pathinfofile     ext  info[extension]      switchext     case ini     code to parse ini files     break      case xml     code to parse xml files     break      case php     code to parse php files     break  codepre  pp  ppersonally, Id break out to internal methods depending on the outcome of the switch  but say I have a more sequential method, a series of steps  i.e.p  precodepublic function doSequence     stepOne  some database access to retrieve values     stepTwo  the result of some interpretation of values     stepThree  a fresh database interaction based on the interpreted values     stepFour  prep values for return     return values  codepre  pSo, what is your guiding principle for refactoring methods into the appropriate level of granularityp
Negative 35203 pSo Im using the class codeMatcode from opencv in a program Im writing.  codeMatcode looks something like thisp  precodeclass Mat      public         Matint width, int height, int type         template lttypename Tgt T getEltint x, int y         int depth         ...  codepre  pThe type in the constructor specifies whether elements in the codeMatcode are codefloatcodes, codeintcodes, etc as well as the number of channels in the image.  codedepthcode returns the data type used to store image elements.p  pUnfortunately I have to call codegetEltcode in my code.  Whenever I do that I use a codeswitchcode statement to check the depth of the codeMatcode so I can call codegetEltcode with the appropriate template parameter.  Doing it that way is pretty verbose, so I was wondering if there was a better way to do it.  Could I create a container for a codeMatcode and use template magic create a method that returns a type as opposed to a value  Or could I use macros to make things more efficient and logicalp  pId rather not have to subclass codeMatcode since there are several methods besides codegetEltcode for which I have this same issue.p  pEdit made the description more accurate.p

Negative 35203 pIve been battling a slow WPF ComboBox this morning, and would love to see if anyone has tips for debugging such a problem.p  pLets say I have two ComboBoxes, A and B.  When A changes, the items in B change as well.  The ComboBoxes each have their SelectedItem and ItemsSource databound like thisp  precodeltComboBox Grid.Column1 ItemsSourceBinding Names SelectedItemBinding CurrentName, ModeTwoWay Margin3 MinWidth100 gt ltComboBox Grid.Column1 Grid.Row1 ItemsSourceBinding SubNames SelectedItemBinding CurrentSubName, ModeTwoWay Margin3 MinWidth100 gt codepre  pWhenever the list in B needs to change, I do this by clearing SubNames and then readding the entries based on the SelectedItem in A.  This is done because overwriting SubNames with a new codeObservableCollectionltstringgtcode breaks the databinding.p  pEverything on one computer runs just as youd expect.  Select A, then click on B and the new items pop up immediately.  On another computer, when I do this there is up to a strong5 secondstrong pause before the ComboBox is rendered.  The number of items is exactly the same.  One difference is that on the slow machine, there is stuff going on in the background with hardware communication.  I froze all of those threads and it didnt help.p  pMy biggest problem is that I cant figure out where to even start looking.  I need to see what the system is doing at the point that the ComboBox is clicked.  Im using databinding, so I cant put a breakpoint anywhere.  I did try to change my declaration of SubNames fromp  precodepublic ObservableCollectionltstringgt SubNames  get set  codepre  ptop  precodeprivate ObservableCollectionltstringgt subnames  new ObservableCollectionltstringgt public ObservableCollectionltstringgt SubNames    get  return subnames    set  subnames  value   codepre  pand then put breakpoints in the getter and setter to see if there was excessive reading or writing going on, but there wasnt any.p  pCan anyone suggest a next step for me to try in determining the source of this slowdown  I dont believe it has anything to do with the ComboBox stock template, as described a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comKBWPFWPFComboBoxPerformance.aspxin this articlea.p

Negative 35203 pThanks in advance for whoever can help with this question.  I have build a messageboarddatabase using html forms, PHP, and my SQL. The website allows people to post topics and then post messages for each topic.  They can then vote up or down on each message.  p  pRight now, I do all that through a single PHP page and I use POST.  When I used GET, every time I used the back and forward buttons, it would ask if I wanted to resend the form very annoying.  I want to protect the data, so I switched to POST, but if someone hits refresh after voting, it votes a second time.  How can I fix that  Shouldnt the POSTed info be refreshed, toop  pI am also thinking of making the initial presentation of the topic page that comes up after they click on the topic name from a search be presented through GET, using a separate PHP page for it.  This way the url for the topic page can be linked to since the actual topic is in the URL, as opposed to the POST page, where the topic is not in the URL.  Though, even if I do this, after someone clicks to vote, the resulting page is identical except that the URL wont have the topic in it since it is through POST now, and people may not realize they could link to it at all.  Is there a way that after voting through the POST option, the page gets redirected to the GET versionp  pFinally, my main question is about SEO.  I want the topic pages to be searchable on google.  So I am thinking of having PHP dynamically generate static HTML pages.  Is this the only way to do it  Should I have them made on the fly  Or just all generated once a day  I figure that when people vote up or down on a message within an HTML page, this would trigger the loading of the respective PHP page through POST. But then it begs the question.. if I want to post a link to a particular topic page or if i set it up so people can link to one off facebook, for example, should I have it link to the static html page or to the url that creates it dynamically by using GET with PHP  Or should I use the HTML page but have it redirect to the GET page url  Or is there a way to just have GET page urls recognizable by google and have google provide links directly to them  I am thinking no, because they are dynamically generated each time, as opposed to static HTML.  Does it matter if I put links up out there to the PHP page, but google directs people to the stat HTML version  I feel like the best thing for SEO would be to keep everything consistent so all the hits are added up together.p  pSorry for so many questions, but I think these are timely issues that affect most database sites that want their pages to be searchable in google.p

Negative 35203 pmy problem is that we try to use a MVC PHP framework. After discussing a lot think that MVC is very good, but Im missing the possibility to write reusable modelapplicationlogic. So, Im not sure if we have the right approach to implement our software in a MVC framework.p  pFirst Ill describe the nonMVC, ooapproach which we use at the moment.p  pFor example  we are working on some browser games yes thats our profession. Imagine we have an player object. We use this player object very often. We have some different pages where you can buy thinks, so you need to make money transactions on the players bankaccount or imagine you can do fights against other players. We have several fightscripts, and these scripts take 2 or more player objects it depends on the type of battle ie. clan battle, player vs. player battle....p  pSo, we have several pages and controllers with different battlelogic. But each of this controllers use the playerobject to calculate all the attributes and items a player has and which damage and defence a player will do.p  pso, how can we reuse the logic in the player object in case of a MVC Model it would be bad to duplicate all the necessary logic in the different fightcontrollers and models.p  pI think the goldtransactionlogic would be a good example to give you some more detail information. you need the transactfunction in case of a fight, if you win against an other player and loot some of his gold, you need the transaction function in case of buying some stuff and you need the transactfunction in case of spending some gold to the players guild...p  pSo, I would say it would be a bad approach to define all these functions in one player model I can say you these player model would be very big actually we have the problem that our playerclass is really huge  its a god classp  pdo you think there is a MVCstyle solution for this problemp

Negative 35203 pThis might sound funny but I got a homework and I cant make any sense of it. The statement sounds like this    Find the 10 largest numbers in an array of 100.000 randomly generated integers. You will use threads to compare 2 numbers. A daemon thread will print at regular intervals the progress and the number of unchecked integers left.p  pI know itcodes not appropriate to ask for help on the forum regarding a homework but I am really REALLY frustrated .... I just cancodet figure out why, and how, should I use threads to deal with number comparison ..... Especially when it is about 100.000 integers. Even if I go through the list with a simple for using a max variable and printing out all the values it only takes about 150 milliseconds, at mosti tried p  pCould you at least give me a starting idea on it p  pSorry for wasting your time p  pCONTINUEDp  pAs I said in a reply, braking up the array into X chunksno. of threads would be a good idea if I would have to find only 1 elementthe largest but because I need to find the 10 largest elements, supposing one thread finds its max value in the chunk it is working on, and discards the rest, maybe one of the discarded ones would actually be larger than the rest of the elements in the other chunks. That is why I dont think this would a good result. p  pFeel free to argue my point of viewp

Negative 35203 pI have run into a situation with a C application installed at two sites where the initial connection to SQL Server is extremely slow.  I wrote a test application to verify where the slowdown occurs and it is on the first SQLConnection.Open statement.  It was taking about 41 seconds to establish a connection to the server via named pipes.  We thought it might be a DNS issue but its just as slow using a TCPIP connection.  After the initial connection is made the connection is pooled and the application responds normally.  Both the workstation and the server are decent machines running Windows 7 Pro, Core 2 Duo 3.16 Ghz with 4 gig of Ram.  I did find the following article on a microsoft forum p  pa hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenwindowscompatibilitythreadf295994c58124e468ac9f05471d4dd54 relnofollowhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenwindowscompatibilitythreadf295994c58124e468ac9f05471d4dd54ap  pTurning off the LLMNR protocol did cut the initial connection time in about half to 21 seconds.  However, this is still a long time to get an initial connection to SQL Server.  The only things slightly different from our norm is that DNS in this case is done thru a router and not an actual server.  This has occurred at only two places so far, others run with no issues.  Any help would be appreciated.p  pThank You, Dennisp
Negative 35203 pEDIT I cant get some of the indents to work correctly, but the code is complete and blocked correctly. Sorry.p  pFor a class assignment Ive had to implement part of a simple UNIX shell. It must support redirection, piping, and backgrounding. I was provided with a parser that populates a struct called Commandline Ill include the struct prototype below. My job is to write a function that processes these Commandlines handles redirection, backgrounding, piping, and executes programs. p  pIve almost got it working but for some reason it doesnt properly handle commands of the form emprogram1  program2  fileem. For example, cat lt file1.in  cat  file2.in. The problem doesnt seem to be in the redirection as Ive written test programs to put in front of the pipe that do not require redirection but still cause the same problem. The pipelining does work in most cases its just these programs with  as an argument that cause problems.p  pWhen I run one of these problematic command lines, the output from the first program is printed and the process hangs up I have to manually suspend and kill it. It does not give the user a prompt afterwards or react to input aside from ctrl  z which I use to suspend the process.p  pAny advice on how to get this working would be much appreciated.p  pHeres the structp  precode This is the structure that holds the information about a parsed   command line.

Negative 35203 pWhat are the best practices for building a GUI desktop app that will support both Windows and OS X Lets say its budgeting software, so there is a bit of math and some big data structures. User data is saved in XML files there is no separate database or networking.p  pAt one extreme, you could just build the Windows version in C and the Mac version in Objective C. Is there a better approach, so you can more easily keep the two versions in sync and write less duplicate code Would you write the math and data structures and business logic in C, with preprocessor directives for simple system calls like IO, and then a separate GUI layer written once for Windows and once for OS X Is CC the only choice for the crossplatform back end, assuming you want native code Is there any way to write even the GUI part a single time I expect not.p  pPlease note that Im not asking how to use a crosscompiler. Im interested in how youd structure your overall project for the least hassle.p

Negative 35203 pI have a distributed application which polls for commands from a central server and the content of those commands are signed by a private key with the public key deployed along with the application at each remote site. Each command is signed with the private key and that signature is verified before the command is executed.p  pHere is how I generate my publicprivate key pairs in java. emI realize, we should be doing more then 1024emp  precodeKeyPairGenerator keyGen  KeyPairGenerator.getInstanceDSA, SUN     SecureRandom random  SecureRandom.getInstanceSHA1PRNG, SUN keyGen.initialize1024, random KeyPair pair  keyGen.generateKeyPair codepre  pThe new requirement is that in addition to sending simple relatively safe commands, we now want to send commands which will instruct our software to download and execute an installer to update itself. This has the potential to open up a big hole if not done correctly. The execute update installer command will be signed as always and will also include the md5 of executable which will be downloaded and run. So, the signature on the command must be correct and will include the md5 and then calculated md5 on the downloaded file will need to be correct, before the execution will occur. This should take care of most attack vectors I can think of. strongAny others I should be concerned aboutstrongp  pSo, now I am directing my attention to securing the private key on the server where these commands originate. If that private key is obtained, it is game over. How should I secure that key on diskp  pMy thought is to use symmetric encryption with a passphrase to secure that private key.p  pMy current solution is as follows p  precodechar[] passphrase  Actual passphrase PrivateKey privateKeyObj  Actual Private Key byte[] privateKeyBytes  privateKeyObj.getEncoded  byte[] salt  new byte[8] new SecureRandom.nextBytessalt  SecretKeyFactory factory  SecretKeyFactory.getInstancePBKDF2WithHmacSHA1 KeySpec spec  new PBEKeySpecpassphrase, salt, 1024, 256 SecretKey tmp  factory.generateSecretspec SecretKey secret  new SecretKeySpectmp.getEncoded, AES  Cipher cipher  Cipher.getInstanceAESCBCPKCS5Padding cipher.initCipher.ENCRYPTMODE, secret AlgorithmParameters params  cipher.getParameters byte[] iv  params.getParameterSpecIvParameterSpec.class.getIV  byte[] ciphertext  cipher.doFinalprivateKeyBytes  FileOutputStream outputFileStream  new FileOutputStreamoutputFile outputFileStream.writesalt outputFileStream.writeiv outputFileStream.writeciphertext outputFileStream.close codepre  pemexceptions removed for clarityemp  pThis basically randomly generates a salt, uses passphrase to come up with key and then stores the resulting salt, IV and cipher text in a file ready for decryption. p  pHowever, I feel something is missing here. Like I should also somehow include some type of MAC on the key so that I know I get a valid description Maybe it is a simple as just putting 5 or 6 bytes of known text before the private key A bad passphrase right now just results in bad padding exception, but I read that this might not always be the case and some bad passphrases will decode and result in junk. I feel I need to guard against this.p  pCan someone let me know if I am on the right track here and provide some feedback. It is important that I get this as secure as possible..p

Negative 35203 pI am using the meter element to show a score between 1 amp 10, and in the newest webkit browsers, it looks fantastic.p  pI would now like to show the average score, as well. While its useful to know that my submission received a 6 out of 10, it would be even more useful to know that the average for this magazine so far is a 5.p  pUnfortunately, the a hrefhttpwww.w3schools.comhtml5tagmeter.asp relnofollowslew of available attributes for the meter taga does not include average.p  pI want to show a simple vertical line at the average value. I thought perhaps I could put a span or a div inside the meter, make it display block, and give it a 100 height, a 50 width, and a borderright. Unfortunately, Chrome 11 doesnt even allow me to nest block elements within the meter, my preliminary investigations indicate.p  pId be willing to use JS to display the vertical line if I had to when I originally envisioned this feature I thought Id be using entirely JS, but the meter tag is so delightful that I refuse to emnotem use it now.p
Negative 35203 pIm working on a oneman ASP.NET MVC 3 project I have complete control over database schema and code, and Im trying to decide between going databasefirst and POCO w my EF4 models, or if I should go w codefirst.p  pThe main thing Im trying to achieve is decorating my models with DataAnnotation attributes so that I can enforce schema validation prior to doing any persistence.  Looking at a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combefdesignarchive20100330dataannotationsintheentityframeworkandcodefirst.aspx relnofollowScott Guthries articlea about model validation w MVC 2, he talks about  article about doing it with codefirst Step 2, and doing it with modelfirst or databasefirst using buddy classes Step 5.p  pI historically have done my database design using the SQL Server designer GUI and scripts, so Im definitely more productive with that, strictly when it comes to database design.  However, unless I ditch the idea of decorating my models w DataAnnotation attributes for validation, I will be violating DRY by not only having model properties in two classes, but having to, in essence, build my schema in two places.p  pIm looking for anyone thats had experience with both methods or even one method, and can offer feedback on which way they went, why they decided that, and how they found it to work.  Id also like to know if I might be better off going a completely different, using tools like Fluent Validation, or maybe even abandoning domain modellevel validation altogether, and keeping my validation in the services and view models.p

Negative 35203 pI am attempting to write some UI automation tests for a WPF application that is using a hrefhttpcaliburnmicro.codeplex.com relnofollowCaliburn.Microa and a hrefhttpwhite.codeplex.com relnofollowWhitea. I am using CMs builtin conventions to bind my controls to the view models properties and methods. I am also using codeConductorcode classes so that I may have multiple views visible on a single screen. This generally means that multiple controls on a screen can end up having the same codexNamecode value. It will just get bound to a different view model. A good idea of what I am trying to do can be seen in the a hrefhttpcaliburnmicro.codeplex.comSourceControlchangesetviewff8f27cb3fb0 relnofollowHelloScreens sample application that comes with CMa.p  pThe problem that I am running in to is that I will have multiple XAML elements with the same codexNamecode attribute so that CM can handle all of the binding work for me. This unfortunately means that multiple codeUIItemcode objects will have the same UI Automation ID. The only way I have found to get, for instance, different codeTextBlockcode elements with codexNameDisplayNamecode is to make a call such as the followingp  precodeSearchCriteria criteria  SearchCriteria.ByAutomationIdDisplayName.AndIndex1 WPFLabel label  myWindow.GetltWPFLabelgtcriteria codepre  pThis means my tests need to know the exact order that different controls are placed on the screen, which seems very brittle. I can see my tests all breaking just by adding another view model.p  ul liIs there a way to specify the Automation ID other than using the codexNamecode attributeli liWould this be easier if I used the UI Automation framework directly instead of using Whiteli liOr, do I really have to forego CMs convention based binding and give everyting unique codexNamecode values and bind them by handli ul  pstrongUPDATEDstrongp  pTo clarify what I mean by having multiple views visible at once, here is my general layout. I have my codeShellViewModelcode which I derive from codeConductorltIScreengt.Collection.OneActivecode. Then my view has an codeItemsControlcode that is bound to the shell view models codeItemscode property. Each item template shows a button that is meant to load that specific codeIScreencode into a codeContentControlcode that is on the shells view. So, If I try to look for an element with codexNameDisplayNamecode, I have the label on the shell view, the label on the button in the codeItemsControlcode as well as a label inside of the codeContentControlcode. p

Negative 35203 pI am facing a problem in animation.p  pSo right now in my app, I have a subview which has a close button. When the close button is pressed, a curl down animation occurs showing the previous view. That is working properly. I perform the curl down closing animation by passing a notification to the NSNotificationCenter like this code[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationNamenotificationName objectself]codep  pNow I wanted to apply an animation to the close button itself so that when I press the close button, it would perform an animation as well as the curl down animation would occur. So the way I do it is by the following code p  precode[UIView transitionWithViewself.view.superview duration1                        optionsUIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseIn                     animations                          closeButton.frame  CGRectMake500, 15, 100, 40                      completionnil] codepre  pWhere previously the closeButton.frame had the value of 580,15,100,40 so the animation would be like the image was moving from right to left from 580 to 500.p  pSo what happens when I run the code is that when I press the close button, the close button animation does not happen but the curl down animation occurs. So for testing when I commented out the code where I post the notification, the close button animation works perfectly but the curl down animation does not happen nor does the previous view come up  since I do not send a notification which would cause the view to close. p  pI would like to know what is going wrong here and why it does not allow 2 animations to occur at the same time.p

Negative 35203 pI am currently writing a 2D game using the XNA Game Studio 4.0 framework for Windows Phone 7. I have gotten to the stage where I am tackling the problem of tombstoning the game if the user would like to saveload or if they resume the game at a later point. p  pIm currently using the a hrefhttptiledlib.codeplex.com relnofollowTiledLiba library for the rendering etc of the map and also the a hrefhttpcreate.msdn.comenUSeducationcatalogsamplegamestatemanagement relnofollowscreen state managementa example as a basis for my project eg the events for tombstoning correctly are all in place. The codeMapcode object in the TiledLib library has a multidimensional array code[,]code to store the tiles of the map within each codeTileLayercode. My map only has one codeTileLayercode, and only 1 codeTexture2Dcode with different codeRectanglecode source locations base on what the tile is displaying. It is important that I track all of the appropriate source rectangles for each tile so the map that has been edited can be resumed the way the player left it.p  pIm having quite a lot of trouble trying to work out the best way or any way to achieve tombstoning for the game screen. I have not had much experience with serialization and this is my first attempt at tombstoning for a Windows Phone 7 application. I understand that nonjagged arrays can not be serialized using the usual XmlSerializer, is there a method to get around this Is a custom serializer a good path to go down ProsCons Has any one else had experience with TileLib and serializing a game screen Or a 2D map with an X,Y coordinates How much data is too much data to serialize for tombstoning p  pThanks in advance for answers and advice.p

Negative 35203 pHow do I hide my private API keys infor my webOS  Enyo based appsp  pMy development has basically come to a halt because of this issue.p  pSince webOS Enyo as well as Mojo is coded in Javascript, any user can plug their device in and easily view my source code. So obviously I cant just stick my keys in there. Even if they are encrypted, my app would have to include the mechanism for decrypting them to make any use of them. Im looking to hide my private web service API keys mainly OAuth Twitter, Facebook, Google, etc. and maybe my AWS private keys.p  pSo far the answers I found have stated that you cant secure anything like a private API key in Javascript. But all of those discussions have been dealing with web applications which have easy alternatives to using Javascript. webOS apps dont really have a pretty alternative to coding simple apps in Javascript.p  pThe only path I see possible is to create a proxy that all of my API calls would pass through. Is that the only feasible or ideal option If it is, would node.js do the trick for me herep  pAny leads, resources, examples, tips, etc. would be greatly appreciated. I feel like the answer should be starring me in the face since so many apps connect to these services nowadays, but I have had no leads. Thanks.p

Negative 35203 pI recently coded a .C file with scanf in order to take keyboard inputs.  To my great surprise, the cygwin terminal converted all the letters I typed to numbers. My program ran properly though.  The cygwin terminal just didnt show the correct input that I typed.  It even converted some nonalphabet keys into symbols.p  pIf I pressed the same alphabet key multiple times, the numbers showing up in the cygwin terminal would change each time I pressed the key.  I talked to my computer science professor about this and he didnt know how to fix it.p  pAnother thing to be noted is that my professor was able to use the cygwin executable via the command terminal in order to run my .C file.  When he ran the program in this way, the command terminal was able to accept letters.p  pI got the cygwin installation package from the GATech mirror website and this is the first error Ive come across using cygwin.p  pI am using windows XP and netbeans to run the .C  p

Negative 35203 pI am developing an Android app in Eclipse.  I would like to target a wide variety of devices and SDK versions for example, I can optionally support multitouch.  I understand the a hrefhttpandroiddevelopers.blogspot.com201007howtohaveyourcupcakeandeatittoo.htmlutmsourcefeedburneramputmmediumfeedamputmcampaignFeed3Ablogspot2FhsDu28AndroidDevelopersBlog29recommended approacha of isolating all the new functionality to a separate class and leveraging lazy loading to only load that class at runtime if the host device actually supports the feature.p  pThe downside of this approach is that I have to compile all of my code with the SDK of the newest feature I want to use.  Which means if some new feature leaks into my version neutral code, the compiler can no longer catch it.p  pI would like the ability, within Eclipse, to compile my project against an older Android SDK to make sure my version neutral code is fine.  Id like to avoid moving my build system out of Eclipse, if possible.  Im okay with this oldSDK build being a bit awkward to run.p  pI think this boils down to doing some conditional compliation or conditional linking inside Eclipse  For example, in my project when building against SDK1.6 Id like to leave the MultiTouchHandler.java source out of the build.  Im not sure if its possible to express build types like this in Eclipse, though.p  pThe hacky solution seem to be just manually changing the projects SDK version, rebuilding, and looking through the errors, and ignore expected errors.  The overkill solution seems to be writing my own antmavenmake build scripts.p  h3Related Questionsh3  pThis question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3706512versioningandcommoncodebaseswitheclipseVersioning and common codebases with Eclipsea covers similar ground, but would involve moving all of the versionspecific classes into separate libraries.  And I would still have the problem of multiple build types in Eclipse, I think.p  pThis question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1367077buildmultipleprojectconfigurationswitheclipseBuild multiple project configurations with eclipsea implies that I should move to an external build system like ant or maven, but thats a lot more work than just trying a build with an old SDK from time to time.p

Negative 35203 pI have to do a lot of batch calculations , filtering data, making summary tables in MySql.  p  pShould I use stored procedures or a bash script calling MySql command line p  pThey are about equivalent, as far as I can tell, but the advantage of the bash script is I could use shell functions as macros to rerun big statements with small changes. p  pBy a bash script I meanp  precodebinbash  arg11 arg22  mysql user pw db ltlt EOF gt output.out    load table ....   update xx set y  arg1 if ...   insert into xxx select a, b, avgc from xx group by a, b ...   quit EOF codepre  pThe only advantage I can see to a stored procedure is that it checks the types of values you give its arguments.  But a shell script would be much more powerful for reusing code. i could pass in a table name as an argument, or change a Where clause from p  precodewhere name lt Run14  codepre  pto p  precodewhere name regexp RunZ23..[AM] OR name  Run14 codepre  pby passing it as an argument. p  pPerformance is not a problem. p  pThanks  ttp  hr  pAdded years laterp  pThis is somewhat similar to the question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3419604mysqlstoredproceduresorphpcodeMySQL stored procedures or php codea . Though there is disagreement, a lot of people preferred PHP and I feel the reasons given in a hrefhttpwww.codinghorror.comblog200410whoneedsstoredproceduresanyways.html relnofollowWho Needs Stored Procedures, Anywaysa are good ones.  Now I prefer PHP functions instead of MySql stored procs. Of course PHP is better for programming than bash. The main advantage I see to Stored Procs is speed, and that is not a concern for me most of the time.p  pOn Jul 11, 2012 I commented p  blockquote   pI see now a big advantage of stored procedures is they support IF, CASE, and CURSOR LOOP statements.p blockquote  pI meant you can do these things in Bash, but you have to exit MySql, get its information into a shell variable, make your decision, and start MySql again to process further. p  pI dont think it is such an advantage if you use PHP, because in PHP it is easier to get SQL results into variables and even arrays, and you do not have to open a whole new session for each statement. p  pHowever it can be much faster to do many SQL statements in a procedure than from Bash or PHP, especially when there is looping. p

Negative 35203 pI have n points in R3 that I want to cover with k ellipsoids or cylinders I dont really care whichever is easier.  I want to approximately minimize the union of the volumes.  Lets say n is tens of thousands and k is a handful.  Development time i.e. simplicity is more important than runtime.p  pObviously I can run kmeans and use perfect balls for my ellipsoids.  Or I can run kmeans, then use minimum enclosing ellipsoids per cluster rather than covering with balls, though in the worst case thats no better.  Ive seen talk of handling anisotropy with kmeans but the links I saw seemed to think I had a tensor in hand I dont, I just know the data will be a union of ellipsoids.  Any suggestionsp  p[Edit Theres a couple votes for fitting a mixture of multivariate Gaussians, which seems like a viable thing to try.  Firing up an EM code to do that wont minimize the volume of the union, but of course kmeans doesnt minimize volume either.]p
Negative 35203 pI am completing an Android program to classify the genre of a song on a mobile phone.  The classification code is implemented in a native shared library not written by me.  Unfortunately, it only classifies correctly the first time, any times after then it just returns the previous result.  I was thinking this was to do with the fact that some of the variables in the code are declared static and that they are not being instantiated properly between classifications.p  pI need to know how I can free the memory associated with a native library after each classification so that all the variables are instantiated correctly in the next classification.p  pI currently call the native library via a class, can I free the class like in CC explicitly without waiting for the garbage collectorp

If you are sure youre not intentionally defining a core class, then this is the most likely explanation of whats going on.p  pHowever, you might actually be trying to define a class in a core namespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example, from a nonAndroid virtual machine project. This will most assuredly not work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the compatibility of your app with future versions of the platform. It is also often of questionable legality.p  pIf you really intend to build a core library  which is only appropriate as part of creating a full virtual machine distribution, as opposed to compiling an application  then use the corelibrary option to suppress this error message.p  pIf you go ahead and use corelibrary but are in fact building an application, then be forewarned that your application will still fail to build or run, at some point. Please be prepared for angry customers who find, for example, that your application ceases to function once they upgrade their operating system. You will be to blame for this problem.p  pIf you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a core package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to repackage that code. That is, move the classes in question into your own package namespace. This means that they will never be in conflict with core system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help you in this endeavor.

When the user turns on the switch then they can tap and navigate right to see the list of options that they can select.  Trouble is, when the switch is tapped, the cell gets the tap not the switch.  p  pWhat I gotta do to make the switch get the tap first. Im guessing its a firstResponder thing but Im not finding the magic code that I need.p  pOnce I get past this I can probably figure out the enabledisable of the accessory my self...p  pThanks.p

I tried the long way, the one that is being implemented and the short way, the one that is commented at the side.p  pWhy wont the SelectedItem, its content wouldnt pass as it is, a Text from a TextBlock, which is what the ListBox has in it as ListBoxItem p  pThanks to anyone who answer my noob question, and pardon me if I make a mistake when posting this or one when coding, which I dont quite seem to get, since I am asking here and since must be a logic or some other kind of error my sight doesnt see. p  pfr33 p

So if, on the next loop, we get ColorBlue, it will overwrite ColorRed.p  pOf course, this example is simplified pseudocode and in actuality, I have recursive methods for drilling down deep into data and constructing complex objects.p  h1The Problemh1  pMy problem is that I dont know how to merge identical properties into a list.  For example the Object above should ideally look like thisp  precodeTitleCars,ColorsColorRed,ColorBlue,ModelsModelNameExplorer,Enginev6,ModelNameFocus,Enginev4 codepre  pPLEASE NOTE I cant simply make each iteration its own list because if I did, it will break the clientside template engine I am using.

Negative 35203 pI am designing webpage using jquery and php. My page has side menu, and clicking one of the option it send a request to server to read some information from file and it will create a form out of it, with submit and other button editin case anybody wants to change the information in that form and send this html back to client. I am able to do this successfully. But when I click on the edit button it actually not calling the click handler I registered for the all the buttons.p  precodebutton.clickfunction   alertclick event   codepre  pI included this in the p  precodejQuerydocument.readyfunction  codepre  pBut because all the jqueryjs code in ready and it gets executed at the page load time, its not able to find these buttons in form because its something which i get from server after loading and replacing it to existing div and hence its not able to invoke the event handler. If I define click handler for the parent div of this form, it receives the click event if I click edit button because that div was present when initial page got loaded. I might not be doing it correctly, may be getting the whole form from server is not a good idea, if you have to do some operation on the form at client side. But is it doable if yes then whats the possible way out. Thanksp

Negative 35203 pIve just got my feet wet with multithreading and its really awesome.  I find myself trying to figure out new ways I can use it make things better and I think I found one but Im unsure how to design the program for this.p  pHeres the situation. I have a queue server that multiple clients consume and produce data to but to kick start the process I run a java program on to put some initial data for them to start. then my program is done and I have excess capacity on the queue server but nothing is really running on it.  So I want to try to do some maintenance tasks, run a service, and do low priority stuff.Im not sure how do that though.  How do I design a program that does completely different tasks concurrentlyp  pTypically I just wrap my programs in a codewhile truecode loop and it does a single task and I realize I cannot do two while loops at the same time in the same processmaybe nested.  To show a simplified example, I put a bunch of code that runs a runnablemaybe itll process a low priority queue and a service that monitors a socket and replies backI might want to add more depending on cpu usage.  How do I get them all to work together Is there a better way to design itI know long term its probably better to run multiple java processes but right now I am just trying to manage a single file and I suspect theres a way to give the socket service a higher priority than processing the queue within the file but if they are both running in different files I dont know how to lower one over the other instead of them fighting for resourcesp  pThanks and Ill edit this question if it turns out Im explaining this totally wrong. strongBut in a nutshell, I want it to provide a service to other systemsserver socket, in the example and when its idle I want it to do a few other tasks.strongp  pExampleif you understand what Im asking this code may not be necessary to read p  precodeimport java.io.IOException import java.io.ObjectInputStream import java.io.ObjectOutputStream import java.net.ServerSocket import java.net.Socket   public class multipleThreads       private ServerSocket server     private int port  7777      public void ServerSocketExample          try              server  new ServerSocketport          catch IOException e              e.printStackTrace                     public static void mainString[] args           TODO Autogenerated method stub         System.out.printlnstarting          ServerSocketExample example  new ServerSocketExample         example.handleConnection          while true              monitor low low priority queue                          public void handleConnection          System.out.printlnWaiting for client message...

Negative 35203 pI have a powershell process that runs on demand which collects all Request History logs from an application via web service calls. The result requests are casted to objects and have NoteProperty values attributevalue pair end up in a large list array usually 1400 items per week. p  pWhat I wanted to do is store all of these requests for historical purposes so that the application doesnt purge them on their own. Therefore I created a simple table on a database that stores all the attribute value pairs for each request that doesnt already exist in my newly created database.p  pI then setup an OleDB connection in the powershell script to a MSSQL server and select all the records from the table to fill a DataTable im not good with OleDB or DataTables. Afterwhich I loop through each item in the list array to validate it doesnt already exist in the DataTable. For each record that doesnt exist I add a new row in the DataTable with the attributevalue pairs. From there I assume the command builder helps with the Insert statement so I dont have to check each attributevalue if its null or blank or even write the query at all. Then finally I Update the OleDBAdapter with the newly appended DataTable.p  pWhile this process works, I realized that what its doing is pulling down all the data from the database and then comparing to my list array and recommitting the newly added records. The larger the database, the longer this takes. Is there anyway to quickly and more efficiently do this without having to write any SQL statements I like how the CommandBuilder works for DataTables.p  pBelow is the Function called to update the database after all the Request History objects have been fetchedp  precodefunction UpdateDatabase[ParameterMandatorytrue] allRequests      objOleDbConnection  NewObject System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnection     objOleDbCommand  NewObject System.Data.OleDb.OleDbCommand     objOleDbAdapter  NewObject System.Data.OleDb.OleDbDataAdapter     objDataTable  NewObject System.Data.DataTable      objOleDbConnection.ConnectionString  ProviderSQLNCLI10ServerSERVERDatabaseDB1TrustedConnectionyes     objOleDbConnection.Open      objOleDbCommand.Connection  objOleDbConnection     objOleDbCommand.CommandText  SELECT  FROM dbo.RequestLog      set the Adapter object and command builder     objOleDbAdapter.SelectCommand  objOleDbCommand     objOleDbCommandBuilder  NewObject System.Data.OleDb.OleDbCommandBuilder     objOleDbCommandBuilder.DataAdapter  objOleDbAdapter      fill the objDataTable object with the results     [void] objOleDbAdapter.FillobjDataTable     [void] objOleDbAdapter.FillSchemaobjDataTable,[System.Data.SchemaType]Source      store all the primary keys in a list for kicking out dups     sqlid       objDataTable.Rows  foreach  sqlid  .PKID            loop through all the requests     trap      Error i          i  0     total  allRequests.count     foreach request in allRequests                     i         writeprogress activity Filling DataTable status  Complete itotal100 PercentComplete itotal100         check to see if entry already exists in our table by primary key         if sqlid contains request.PKID.Value                      shouldnt have to do this but i noticed sometimes requests are duplicate in the list probably restarted the script and caught some old requests             sqlid  request.PKID.Value              row  objDataTable.Rows.Addrequest.PKID.Value             go through all the attributes from the request and add them to the table             list  getmember in request  WhereObject  .MemberType eq NoteProperty              foreach attr in list                              if request.attr.name ne null                                      row.attr.name  request.attr.name                                         else               PKID already in DB                    update the database with our new records     objOleDbAdapter.UpdateobjDataTable       close the connection      objOleDbConnection.Close  codepre

Negative 35203 pIve looked around at answers to questions regarding executing core data saves in the background, but none that Ive found have directly addressed the following scenariop  pIve set up core data so that when my app launches for the first time, core data is populated from a plist and then saved to the persistent store all on a background thread. During this time, the app displays a please wait popup with an animating activity indicator. This seems to work nicely and generally the app will finish the population even if the user hits the home button during the population, pushing the app to the background. However, it is empossibleem that the app could be completely terminated before this population finishes Ive successfully done this by hitting home, doubletapping home, and removing the app from the multitasking tray emreally really fastem. In this scenario, the app quits without saving the data to the store. On the next launch of the app, the app recognizes that the store already exists, so it doesnt populate, thus leaving the user with a completely empty database. So the questions isarep  ul lipIs there a way to completely remove the store on app termination if the population hasnt finished I attempted to do this in codeapplicationWillTerminatecode which didnt seem to properly recognize if the app was in the middle of populating.pli lipOr, is there a better way to recognize when the store requires population E.g., can I determine if the store is empty upon launchpli ul

Some helpful people directed me to a couple of questions where similar questions were asked but I have already tried those solutions.

Negative 35203 pHow do I gracefully handle an expected nil keypath during a RestKit GETp  pWhen I make a getAllEvents API call if the user doesnt have any events the API will return a null value in the payload, e.g. codeeventsnullcode. The null value causes the RestKit coderequest didFailLoadWithErrorcode and codeobjectLoader didFailWithErrorcode methods to be invoked, which I dont necessarily want because this is the expected behavior where there are 0 events. The error message it gives is codeCould not find an object mapping for keyPath code.p  pCan I handle this in the mapping config andor the delegate methods, or do I need to modify the API, perhaps to return an empty string instead of null. Is there a standard for what JSON should return when the list is emptyp

Negative 35203 pI want to move my email from a somewhat unreliable provider lets say X to Gmail. Unfortunately email provider doesnt allow folder export or direct IMAP link.p  pThe only thing I can do is connect Gmail to X via POP3, so that anything in Xs inbox gets copied to Gmail.p  pThis I have set up, and it works, but of course POP3 only scans inbox.p  pI have thousands of emails in other folders than inbox, so I need to move them to inbox first. However, I can only move messages via Xs web GUI, which only allows moving one page of messages per turn.p  pSo I have to open Saved messages folder, click on Select all, select inbox and click on Move, then the page will reload and I need to do this again... hundreds of times.p  pI made a Javascript function assume MoveToInbox which simulates these actions, and I opened page in Firefox and started Firefox Scratchpad. So, I can keep pressing CtrlR in Scratchpad, then wait for page reload, then press it again, which saves about 50 of time.p  pHowever, I am wondering, if I can somehow make Scratchpad work with that tab so that it waits for page reload, then executes script then waits again, eliminating all the manual repetitive tasks.p  pI thought I could somehow do it with window.addEventListener, but this object seems to get cleared on page reload, so is there something I could use insteadp

Negative 35203 pHeres the scenario.  I often create classes that follow a certain pattern.  All classes extend a base abstract class out of my control with certain methods I wish to always override, including the constructor.  Id like to rightclick on my package name, click New, and then click Foo Class.  Id then have a class added to my project, but using the Foo template instead of the standard class template.  I understand I can change the class template, but I dont want to change it for all classes.  Is this possible without writing a full blown extensionp

Negative 35203 pSay I have an Order table that has 100 columns and 1 million rows.

The more inner joins I add, slows it down further more.p  p3 codeselect OrderID, column1 from Order o join Store s on s.StoreID  o.StoreID order by OrderID desc limit 10codep  pthis seems to speed the execution up, by limiting the columns we select.p  pThere are a few points that I dont understand here and would really appreciate it if anyone more knowledgeable with mysql or rmdb query execution in general can enlighten me.p  pQuery 1 is fast since its just a reverse lookup by PK and DB only needs to return the first 10 rows it encountered. p  pI dont see why Query 2 should take for ever. Shouldnt the operation be the same i.e. get the first 10 rows by PK and emthenem join with other tables. Since theres a FK constraint, it is guaranteed that the relationship will be satisfied. So DB doesnt need to join more rows than necessary and then trim the result, right Unless, FK constraint allows null FK In which case I guess a left join would make this much faster than an inner joinp  pLastly, Im guess query 3 is simply faster because less columns are used in those unnecessary joins  But why would the query execution need the other columns while joining Shouldnt it just join using PKs first, and then get the columns for just the 10 rowsp  pThanksp

Negative 35203 pOur application is configured to use Forms Authentication, and on most machines it is working great. However, I am having a problem with the development environment on one of our developer workstations. When I go to one of the URLs of the application, like thisp  pa hrefhttpiweb.localreportshttpiweb.localreportsap  pIIS prompts me for a password, like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXnsuy.png altIIS prompts for a username and passwordp  pemThe name codeiweb.localcode is set up in the hosts file to point to 127.0.0.1. Essentially it is an alias for localhost. We configure the IIS site to use a host header so we can potentially support more than one application in the future.emp  pI am not prompted for a password if I go to most other URLs in the application, such as a hrefhttpiweb.localhttpiweb.locala. And I am not prompted for a password anywhere using the exact same code base on any other developer machine. It is only this one machine that is having the problem. This leads me to be reasonably confident that this isnt a problem with the coding. p  pThings I have triedp  ul liTesting with a different web browser. On the machine exhibiting the problem, the problem happens no matter what browser I am using. I get the same prompt in FireFox and IE9.li liTesting on other developer machines. The problem doesnt happen on those. It only happens on the single developer box.li liCopying the code and assets from codeAreasReportscode into codeAreasReportsTestcode, with the appropriate refactors, and loading codehttpiweb.localreportstestcode. That works the browser no longer prompts for a username and password. However, changing the URL is not an option for our application.li liChecking IIS authentication configuration. Anonymous Authentication and Forms Authentication are enabled. Everything else is disabled. This is identical on all developer machines, including the ones that work and the one that doesnt.li liChecking the Event Log. IIS is not logging anything to the event log.li liChecking the IIS logs. The logs contain entries for successful requests like when I open codehttpiweb.localcode, but it does not log anything for any requests that prompt the user to enter a password.li liChecking the request and response headers with FireBug. The request headers seem identical for a request to either URL. The response headers for codehttpiweb.localreportscode has two options for codeWWWAuthenticatecode codeNegotiatecode and codeNTLMcode. From this, I have confirmed that IIS is directing the browser to prompt for a password. But Im no closer to understanding why.li liShutting down IIS, setting the World Wide Web Publishing Service to have a Startup Type of Manual so that it wont automatically start up, and rebooting the computer. I then checked to see if either codehttpiweb.localcode or codehttpiweb.localreportscode were responding to requests. Neither were, confirming that it is IIS that is handling the requests.li liStopping IIS, deleting the entire project from the developers hard drive, and retrieving it from source control. My thought here was that it might be a permission issue on one of the folders though I dont understand how that could be, given that this is an MVC application and that going through this process would ensure that all folders had the correct permissions. But it didnt change anything.li liCompletely uninstalling IIS, restarting the computer, and reinstalling IIS. This didnt work either.li ul  pI am out of ideas. I cannot find anything on this one developer box that isnt configured the same as the other developer boxes. p  pSo strongDoes anyone know a way to enable a deeper level of logging or tracing to figure out why IIS is asking for a password Can anyone think of anything that may be causing this that I havent already looked forstrongp  pThis is an ASP.NET MVC 3 application running on IIS 7.5 in a 64bit environment.

Negative 35203 pI am using Delphi with VCL styles enabled and I would like to change the color of the TSplitter for my form.

Is there a way to remove this flickeringp  pIve tried these things to try and reduce the flickering, but none have workedp  ol lipDisabling VCL styles codeTSplitter.StyleElements  []code.pli lipChanging the VCL Styles Bitmap Style Designers object element for Splitter, but modifying this object element doesnt change the splitters appearance.pli lipTrying to process the codeWMERASEBKGNDcode message on codeTControlcode objects, but I was unable to get the procedure to be called in my interposer class.p  precodeprocedure WMEraseBkgndvar Msg TWMEraseBkgnd message WMERASEBKGND ... procedure TSplitter.WMEraseBkgndvar Msg TWMEraseBkgnd begin      this is never invoked by the TSplitter     Msg.Result  1 end codepreli ol  pAny other ideas for getting rid of the flickering on a codeTSplittercode  Theres no DoubleBuffer  property for codeTSplittercode or anything like that from what I can tell.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pUnfortunately, I cant share the codebase, but I can tell you that this is the way the application UI is setup when the codeTSplittercode flickersp  precodeTForm DoubleBuffered  False gt BackgroundPanel DoubleBuffered  True, ParentBackground  False gt gt A TGradient, image and label to fill the BackgroundPanel gt LeftPanel ParentBackground  False, no flickering gt gt LeftPanelFrame and frame content selective double buffering gt TSplitter gt RightPanel ParentBackground  False, no flickering gt gt RightPanelFrame and frame content selective double buffering codepre  pThere is also a toolbar and a main menu at the top of the form, but the rest of the UI components are set to alClient or OnResized to fill the space.p  pI assumed that since the BackgroundPanel is behind the LeftPanel, codeTSplittercode, and RightPanel i.e, Control  Send to Back, the codeDoubleBuffered  Truecode and codeParentBackground  Falsecode on the BackgroundPanel would help reduceremove the flicker from any components on an immediate UI layer in front of it i.e, the codeTSplittercode.  But, this doesnt seem to be the case.p  pPerhaps Ill try placing a codeTPanelcode as a parent of LeftPanel, codeTSplittercode, and RightPanel and set its codeDoubleBuffered  Truecode and codeParentBackground  Falsecode.  Ill have to try that later and get back.  So, it would look like thisp  precodeTForm gt BackgroundPanel DoubleBuffered  True, ParentBackground  False gt gt A TGradient, image and label to fill the BackgroundPanel gt EncapsulatingPanel DoubleBuffered  True, ParentBackground  False gt gt LeftPanel ParentBackground  False gt gt gt LeftPanelFrame and frame content gt gt TSplitter gt gt RightPanel ParentBackground  False gt gt gt RightPanelFrame and frame content codepre  pLastly, I should note that double buffering the TForm substantially slows down the UI when resizing a black trail on the right of the window, not when doing other UI things when the app is not resizing.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pUnfortunately, while my approach above creating a background parent codeTPanelcode fixed the flickering on the codeTSplittercode, it also caused other weird UI issues, perhaps some of which David Heffernan alluded to in the comments.  For now, Ive just left the flickering issue, since the splitter is only 1px wide and only flickers on width  height resizing.p

Negative 35203 pI am attempting to recreate the status of a customer at an exact point in time. For instance, each customer has many attributes that can change at any time e.g., riskscore, billingstodate, customer satisfaction.p  pEvery time a customer submits an application for credit, I would like to see the value of all of these characteristics at the time of submission. Subsequently, I want to use these values to develop a predictive model.p  pMy first thought was to create a Type2 slowly changing dimension with effective and expiration datetimestamps and to use a halfopen join timeeffective lt dateofapplication lt timeexpired.p  pHowever, most of these attributes are behavioral dimensions that require complicated calculations using historic data from fact tables. Moreover, the calculated values also cannot be grouped using ranges 0500, 500750, etc.. Keeping track of all of these attributes for each dimension cause it to explode. Note Some values change daily, others change at arbitrary points in time.p  pMy ideal data extract would be as followsp  ul liID for Credit Applicationli liTime of submissionli liValue of Attribute 1 at time of submissionli liValue of Attribute 2...li liValue of Attribute Nli ul  pIn addition to credit applications, there are other fact tables where I want to find characteristics that were in effect at the time of that event.p  pWhat are recommendations for handling this I see several approachesp  ol liAllow the dimension to explodeli liCreate separate tables that have one or several attributes and separately query the particular tables that have the attributes I am interested inli liAppend a column to the credit applications fact table that contains a snapshot of all the attributes I am interested in.li ol  pSome of these issues are discussed in Kimballs ETL Toolkit book pp 190192 and in his Data Warehouse Toolkit book 187191. On pp 154157, there is a discussion of rapidly changing monster dimensions that seems very relevant. Still, Im having trouble implementing these recommendations.p

Negative 35203 pIm hoping for advice on designing a workorder system that has to support recurring workorders. For example, An administrator needs to be able to set a workorder to repeat in a unit of time like every 6months.p  pIm using NodeJS as a server, a noSQL database couchDB for storage and elasticsearch as a search engine. Heres my first attempt at a document structure to support thisp  precodeBase Workorder     id 1    ... Unrelated fields    recurInValue  6,    recurInUnit  months    lastRecurredOn 1368914552527,    numOcurrences 1,    numTimesToRepeat null,    stopOn  1384920941195,    createdAt 1364936177618   Occurrence Workorder     id 2    ... Unrelated fields    recurFrom  1   Occurrence Workorder     id 3    ... Unrelated fields    recurFrom  1  codepre  pMy current CRUD plan isp  h2CREATEh2  pA cron job will poll the database hourly and get all of the workorders that have a nonempty recurInValue base workorders. It will then calculate the actual date of recurrence by adding the time given by recurInValue and recurInUnit to lastRecurredOn, if present, or createdAt, if not. moment.js works great for this. If the actual date of recurrence is lt now, the system will copy the workorder, set the recurFrom property to the base workorders ID, and update the appropriate fields.p  h2Readh2  pThis one is a little tricky as workorders have associated notes, activity log entries, and system log entries. These associated items all live in their own documents that have a workorderId property set to the parent workorders ID. Locating an individual workorders associated documents is trivial and is done by couchdb.p  pHowever, using notes as an example, the customer wants to see all of the notes from past workorders along with an occurrence workorders notes. Ive got this working by using ElasticSearch to find all of the workorderIDs that either share the same recurFrom value id of base workorder or that have an id that matches the workorders recurFrom property base workorder. The system then bulk fetches the corresponding notes in createdAt order chronological and passes them off to the view. p  pI havent worked out how to display everything though. A user could in theory add a note to a previous workorder emafterem the latest note on the one the user is viewing so displaying the notes in chronological order may be confusing. I might be able to get around this in the view by differentiating the current workorders notes from other notes by color or in separate sections, but Im not sure about that.p  h2Updateh2  pOne thing that seems tricky here is updating the recurInValue. If that changes, I think I would need to change the base workorder, not the occurrence workorder, so for example, if the user clears out the recurInValue the workorder will stop repeating.p  h2Deleteh2  pIm still a little fuzzy on this. If the user wants to delete an occurrence workorder, I can just delete it and its associated documents and ask them if they want to stop the workorder from repeating. If they say yes, I can clear out the base workorders recurInValue.p  pIf the user deletes a base workorder, repeating will obviously stop but all of the occurrence workorders will have a recurFrom property that points to a nonexistent document. If I leave the recurFrom property as is, I will be able to load all occurrence workorers associated documents and display them properly, but it doesnt feel right.p  h2Other Optionsh2  pIm not tied to this implementation, its just what Ive come up with so far. I considered a linked list implementation where each occurrence workorder would point back to the previous workorder, but it seems having to walk the list in a long chain of workorders and load each workorders associated documents individually would result in an excessive number of queries and not be very efficient.p  pAny advice you can give me is appreciatedp

Negative 35203 pI help develop and manage software in which among other things users can provide their own JavaScript scripts to run macros and the like. Were using Mozilla Rhino in a Java context. We have quite a large API, wherein there are a variety of well known variables and utility functions we place in the scopes a priori. For example, things like cellObject.assignToname which are widely used, but obviously only make sense within the scope of our product.p  pThis all works quite well, but now were close to releasing a newer and better version of the software. Among other things, it will drastically update the API of various objects, and even change the names of some of the variables that are placed in scope e.g. cellObject to plot.getCell0.p  pAlong with this new version, were going to be including some automatic migration for userdefined scripts. So I was wondering, what would you guys suggest to be the best plan of action Are there any reliable tools out there that might help Currently were looking into basically executing a number of very complex regular expressions on the scripts as a besteffort attempt at migration.

Negative 35203 pI just happened to read the thesis of Joe Armstrong and dont have much prior knowledge of Erlang. I wonder what happens if a delivery receipt for some message never arrives. What does the sending actor do It sends the message another time This could confuse the recipient actor when it receives the same message another time. It has to be able to tell that its receipt was not received and therefore the second message is void. p  pThat kind of problems always kept me away from solutions where message delivery is not transactional. I think I know the answer the sending actor tells its supervising actor that something must be wrong when it didnt obtain a receipt in reasonable time causing the supervisor to take some action like restarting the involed actors or something. Is this correct I see no other solution that doesnt result in theroretically possible infinite message sends.p  pThanks for any answer, Oliverp

I can iterate over the two lists and display the information I want HOWEVER...p  pstrongTHE PROBLEMstrongp  p...Now I need to reorder these lists together with the highest priority or sums of priorities which are stored as the values in prioSums first.p  pI have wracked my brain trying to think about using an instantiated class with three properties as given advice by others, but I cant seem to wrap my brain on how that would work, given my WebMatrix C.netwebpages environment. I know how to call a class from a code.cscode file from the current code.cshtmlcode file, no problem, but I have never done this by instantiating a class to make it an object before sorry, still new to some of the more complex C logicmethodology.p  pCan anyone suggest how to accomplish this, or perhaps show an easier at least easier to understand way of doing this In short all I really need is these two lists ordered together by the value in prioSums from highest to lowest.p  pstrongNOTEstrongp  pPlease forgive me if I have not provided quite enough information. If more should be provided dont hesitate to ask.p  pAlso, for more information or background on this problem, you can look at my previous question on this here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17604201isthereanywaytoloopthroughmysqlresultsandstorecertainnamevaluepaiIs there any way to loop through my sql results and store certain namevalue pairs elsewhere in Cap

Lets say Billys three week effort is due one week after my effortHe will start the three week effort prior to the one week effort even though it will get promoted after mine.  His  code is promoted to dev in increments, so it makes no sense for me to make my master from DevLive is my only option, since mine is going in first.p  pWe will do our work separately, Ill post mine to Dev, and a week later, my code is missing because Billys work overwrote my code or vice versa.  There is no merge conflict, Git posts the entire local repository of Billys code, which didnt include my file changes, so my work is just gone.  p

Negative 35203 pI want to give to the user of my app the ability to share a photograph without having an internet connection. It is quite hard to explain but Ill do my best. Basically in my app a user can press on a plus button to take a shot using their iPhone. This image is then uploaded on the Internet Dropbox in a common folder that can be accessed by all app users. When other users open the app, the image that has been uploaded is downloaded on their device. Since there might be more than one image, the app refreshes itself once in a while, and downloads the new photographs. I want to do the same thing using the bluetooth or airdrop. When one device takes a picture, this is saved on the device, and sent to all app users nearby. These users can edit it, send it back to the original device where it can be accessed by everyone. basically the original device acts as a server, and all other devices stream the information from that device. The whole purpose of this is to have, say 15 different iOS devices all in the same room in sync which display the same exact thing. When someone edits, all the other people will see it, as if they where in sync with the cloud which now is Dropbox. p  pI understood that this might be possible with codeMultipeerConnectivity.frameworkcode as it permits more than one device to be connected at the same time. I also found an example app called beam it a hrefhttparctouch.combeamit relnofollowhttparctouch.combeamitap  pWhat Im asking here is not really for some code, rather some indications on how I could approach the problem. p

Negative 35203 pFirst things first, some context. If youre familiar with the problem, skip down to the codeBindingExpressioncode part.

Within this, I have a number of codeViewscode and codeViewModelscode. These reside within a master codeApplicationViewcode and codeApplicationViewModelcode respectively.p  pThe way I change views is through using XAML DataTemplate elements in the codeApplicationViewcode, like sop  precodeltDataTemplate DataTypexType viewmodelsInitViewModelgt     ltviewsInitView gt ltDataTemplategt codepre  pAnd then in the main body I have a ContentControl which binds to a property in codeApplicationViewModelcodep  precodeltContentControl ContentBinding CurrentPageViewModelgt codepre  pWhen I run the application, all of this appears to work fine, and does exactly what is intended. However, when I look at the Debug output after the run, I get a lot of codeBindingExpressioncode errors.p  pHere is one for example. I have a property, codeSplashTextcode, in my codeInitViewModelcode. This is bound to a textblock in the splash screen codeInitViewcode.

Negative 35203 pI have a Gridview and inside I have another one nested gridview. When I press a plus button the nested gridview expanded using a javascript. The nested Gridview expanded on edit mode using Textbox controls. So when the user type on a textbox would have the ability to update the cell using an update button. My problem is that when I press the update button the update occurs but not how I would expected. If for example the initial value of a cell was My name is Peter and I have done the edit I dont have a name The new value that will be saved is exactly this My name is Peter, I dont have a name. The databind of the nested gridview occurs on the parent gridview databound event.

Negative 35203 pIm writing a program that moves docs from one app to another in ApplicationXtender AX.  The AX fullfeatured client already has such a program Migration Wizard that can handle the task, so I created a function that launches it using Process.Start and supplying the arguments necessary to automate it.  When I call the function from a console app or windows form app, the Migration Wizard works perfectly.  But the process must be initiated by an event in a webbased workflow project, so I wrote a web service that contains the same function, and then I use an invoke web service control in the workflow to start it.  When I consume the function from the web service, the process doesnt complete.  I can see it hanging in the task manager.  Im pretty sure it has to do with the user settings in IIS, but Im not familiar enough with IIS to make any significant difference.  Ive configured the anonymous authentications user identity in IIS to launch with a specific user with full rights to AX, and set the DefaultAppPool to run as Local System, but neither worked.  Im thinking I may need to impersonate the user, but I dont know how to do that.

Negative 35203 pI am working on codeASP.NET MVC 4code project from scratch. I decided to start with the data access layer using codeEntity Framework 5code and codeCode Firstcode workflow. The company where I used to work was using very good implementation in my opinion of the codeRepository patterncode including Repositories, Services, Abstract Factory for the Repositories and the Services and codeUnitycode for codeDIcode. I tried to redo it but its just too complicated for me and will cost me a lot of time to replicate what Ive been using there, so I decided to do some research and go with something lighter. p  pSo I decided to use codeGenericRepositorycode and codeUnitOfWorkcode  far from what was the initial plan, but that was the implementation that was showing in most of my searches. So I did a very basic implementation Just to the point where Im sure I know whats going on, maybe even below my abilities to comprehend and actually I think for this exact project it may be just enough but what I want is to be able to call additional custom methods on the different entities.p  pI think this gets a lot from the idea of generic repository, but if I try to go with some other implementation its getting exponentially harder, so I wonder if theres a way to add this to my implementation without hurting too much the idea behind the generic Repository.p  pWhat I have now is the codeGenericRepositorycode class p  precodepublic class GenericRepositoryltTEntitygt where TEntity  class              internal DBContext context         internal DbSetltTEntitygt dbSet          public GenericRepositoryDBContext context                      this.context  context             this.dbSet  context.SetltTEntitygt                   public virtual IEnumerableltTEntitygt Get                      IQueryableltTEntitygt query  dbSet             return query.ToList                  just the standard implementation codepre  pand my codeUnitOfWorkcode class p  precodepublic class UnitOfWork  IDisposable              private DBContext context  new DBContext         private CustomerRepository customerRepository          public CustomerRepository CustomerRepository                      get                              if this.customerRepository  null                     this.customerRepository  new CustomerRepositorycontext                 return customerRepository                                private GenericRepositoryltOrdergt orderRepository          public GenericRepositoryltOrdergt orderRepository                      get              codepre  pSo as you may see my codeOrdercode entity is using the codeGenericRepositorycode but I made a test class codeCustomerRepositorycode to use for my codeCustomercode entity.p  pFor now this class codeCustomerRepositorycode looks like this p  precodepublic class CustomerRepository  GenericRepositoryltCustomergt              public CustomerRepositoryDBContext context  basecontext        codepre  pand the idea is to add the methods that are explicitly for the codeCustomercode entity here. Im not sure if this is correct, especially the way I call the constructor. However, what is the natural way to add those specific methods for the different entities I dont mind to even take a step back to implement it better but I dont want to rush it cause I tried and at the moment the whole concept is too complicated for me and I want to be sure that I understand the things that I use in my code.p

Negative 35203 pLets say we have a string with wordsbr 1 2 3 4 5br br I want all combinations of three words, but the order cant change. The string can be anywhere from 4 words up to 7 words long. Not longer as there would be too many combinations. So the result for the example 1 2 3 4 5 would be an array with stringsbr 1 2 3br 1 2 4br 1 2 5br 1 3 4br 1 3 5br 1 4 5br 2 3 4br 2 3 5br 2 4 5br 3 4 5brp  pIve been thinking about this for a while. One idea was to turn it into an array, generate a binary code for the amount of words and if it is a 1 then it shows the word and otherwise it doesnt so you get anything from 11100 to 00111. But thats probably not optimal.p  pSpeed matters in this case, as it possible has to be done tens of thousands of times within a few minutes.p

Negative 35203 pHeres the scenario Ive some info to show on a ListView. Every row can have, title, body, date, avatar, and more data. And a ImageView that comes from network.

This way the app loads an image from diskmemory 80 of the time if you are in a good network and you scroll in a normal speed and the listview does not flicker.p  pThe solution Im searching is to preset the size of the placeholder at the same size that will be the downloaded image.

Negative 35203 pI am using djangoallauth to handle user registration in my site. I noticed a strange behavior. Lets say I register a new user in the site. That user gets a new email with a link to click. When the user clicks that link it takes him in the confirm page. There the user clicks the confirm button and users email is confirmed. p  pThe problem is that as as a side effect the user is also logged in. I dont want that. This only happens only the first time I visit that page. If I visit that page again and confirms the email the user does not log in automatically. p  pMy question is how can I prevent the user log in even in the first time he confirms the email.

I hope I did a good job with that. After that in my urls.py, right before the imports for allauth, I copied the line that is used for confirmemail and redirected it to my own view.

Negative 35203 pSo I have a library project that is common to all of my android projects. This project is split into 2 modules, 1 of which is the Java specific module where I put reusable components specific to java, and the other is the android module where I put reusable android specific components. The android module also requires the java module, so the android project compiles the java module in its build.gradle file with codecompile projectjavalibrarycode. I have a standalone eclipse project setup to make edits to the library all by itself. Everything compiles and works fine so far. I can run tests, etc just fine. p  pI add the entire library project to my git repo as a git submodule, and then Id like to be able to add the android library project to the build of my android project, and the java library project where applicable. strongThis is where I start to have problems.strongp  pI end up with a directory structure like thisp  precodeAndroidProject   build.gradle   settings.gradle   library     build.gradle     settings.gradle     androidlibrary       build.gradle     javalibrary       build.gradle   AndroidAppModule     build.gradle codepre  pSo in the AndroidProject settings.gradle I add codeinclude libraryandroidlibrary, libraryjavalibrarycodep  pAnd then for the AndroidAppModule build.gradle dependencies I call codecompile projectlibraryandroidlibrarycodep  pstrongIll get a build error at this pointstrong Ill try and build, and Ill get a build error because the library android project cant find the library java project. So I can go into the androidlibrary build.gradle and change codecompile projectjavalibrarycode to codecompile projectlibraryjavalibrarycode and it will resolve all build conflicts and work perfectly.p  pThen when I go back to the intellij project that I make edits to the the library project to do an edit or what not, it wont build any more because the android library is then looking to libraryjavaproject when really it should just be looking to javaproject because the library directory only exists when its added as a git submodulep  pSo I need some way of standardizing this, so that the entire library project directory will see itself as its own root directory, or some other clever way of doing this. How would I go about thisp

Negative 35203 pWe have a WPF user control that provides drag and drop functionality. Weve also used an adorner to provide visual dragdrop feedback to the user about the framework element being dragged. If the hosting application for our user control is WPF, we can drag from the user control and drop to the target control that is hosted in the WPF form and we see the adorner. We have no issues with this scenario. p  pHowever, we have an issue because we need this WPF user control to be inside a VB.NET windows form. For our Windows Form project, We added a reference to the WindowsIntegration assembly and added a WPF control inside an ElementHost.  This works great and we can drag and drop but the one issue we cant solve is that when we drag from the user control to the target element hosted in the VB.NET windows form, the adorner doesnt show.p  pPlease helpp

Negative 35203 pThis is a followup question to the one I posted yesterday p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24111555sizeofmyobjectnotwhatihavecalculatedsizeofmyobject not what I have calculatedap  pI create a class and calculate its size using codesizeofmyclasscode. The size is 12 bytes. I then add virtual members, and the size goes up to 24 bytes. It appears to be the data packing problem again since the size of the vtable pointer is only 8 bytes. p  pSo, my quesion is is it possible to tell the compiler to put the vtable pointer before the other data members so that I can keep that extra 4 bytes of unused space I know I can order the data members, but can I order the vtable pointerp  pJohnp

Negative 35203 pI have done a program that numerically solves a set of differential equations which describes how an arbitrary illness move in an isolated and constant population, it was a programming assignment from a class I took a while ago. What Ive done to extend it is to add some graphical components that can pause, reset and play the simulation, as well as some components that allows me to change some constants in the equations.p  pAll this was an exercise in programming as I find it to be fun and exciting and want to become better.p  pHowever, at the moment Im stuck, what I want to do now is to make a very simple form of animation of it. I want to visualize the data I get for the number of infected, susceptibles and resistants in a grid as points. I managed to create the grid and have an idea of how to place the dots.p  pThe problem I have is how to draw the dots as the program is working, I can draw one dot in the grid but only as the grid is created, thats it. I need to be able to create a dot at a specific place in the grid, this goes on until the number of dots reaches a finite number, say 30. At that points I want to have the first dot, the one the left, removed, all the dots shifted to the left and place the new dot at the furthest right of the grid, the whole thing is then repeated.p  pI think I will be able to figure it out with some helphints about the codepaintComponentcode method and whether I need to use repaint method at all, I cant get my head around these for some reason. Ive read through my course literature on Java, but despite the extensive sections where he explains most of the different graphical components he does not say that much about those methods, only that you dont call for the codepaintComponentcode method, it is done automatically.p  pIf there is something unclear let me know and Ill try to clarify it.p  pThanks in advance.p  p Fox Mulderp

Negative 35203 pIs there a significant performance difference between using the MWS XML API vs using MWS to upload flat files for adding items to FBA inventory p  pMy client wants to be able to immediately print an FNSKU after the item has been through our listing procedure. The listing procedure gathers all of the data on the item that Amazon needs to create the record in inventory. p  pCurrently, there is another processing step that uploads a flat file with all of the item information, but takes 10 minutes to process. Hes currently using a software product called Listtee to process FBA inventory, and it is capable of immediately returning the FNSKU somehow. Im wondering if it may be because they use the XML process instead of the file upload process.p  pHas anyone else had any experience with thisp  pThanks in advancep

The second one is more efficient because it uses the index on the created field, but will mean that the application will need to go out and get the last reporting period and get the lower and upper boundaries on the daterange field Not the worst thing in the world.  And I guess I could always write it as a function or a view.  But, Im just a little surprised that PostgreSQL didnt figure out it could use an index.

Negative 35203 pIm using EF 6 in a WPF application. Im trying to build a layered architecture that abstracts the database specific code from the rest of the application. Im taking the approach of databinding instances of DbSetlt.Local to my UI controls in order to ease the burden  of change tracking. Im keeping the context around for a long time, i.e. from the time a new database is opened until the time that it is closed.

Currently, Ive got it narrowed down to this one exception that occurs when I attempt to clear all entities from DbSet.Local. See the line of code in MVPModel.Clear in the code below.

I have tried p  p1codesummaryresultpvaluecode which gives value codeNULLcodep  p2codedatamodelcoef[2,4]code which says this is out of bounds in fact playing around I couldnt access anything outside of the first column of coefficients without receiving the same error message  p  pI have tried a slew of other methods that are more or less the same idea as these two and each time I either get the dreaded codeNULLcode, the occasional codeNAcode or the codeout of boundscode error.

But when it comes to there just being no code1234code profile, Im not sure what I should return. I dont want to return codecode because that might give the impression there is a record with no data.

Negative 35203 pIm working on visualizing several geojson files with a large set of properties. I would like to use jsonld to add some meaning to some of these properties. I dont have a lot experience with JSONLD, but sucessfully applied the jsonld.js to expand, compact, etc. my geojson file and context. In doing so I noticed that the end results only returns the graph that is actually described in the context. I can understand that, but since it only represents a small part of all my properties, I have some difficulty using the results. p  pIt would help me if I could somehow merge the results of the jsonld operation with the original geojseon file. egp  precodeproperties          lthttppurl.orgdctermstitlegt My Title,         lthttppurl.orgdctermstypegt lthttpexample.commytypegt,         NonJSONLDPropertyKey  NonJSONLDPropertyValue,         etc. codepre  pI would still be able to recognize the properties with an URI, but could also work with the nonjsonld properties. Any suggestions how this might work Or is there a better approachp

Negative 35203 pLet me explain first what I mean by exiting cleanly.p  pIf I have a nodejs app and I do setTimeout for a really long time, or if I open a socket connection that I dont close, then when I run that app it will not exit. The reason is quite clear and a good one I think, the way nodejs works is to wait until there is no more work to do, sort of, and then it exits. Thats good and I like that way of operation. It also forces me to be a bit disciplined about closing sockets cleanly and not having timers lying around. Another good thing.p  pHowever, I have the problem that I have been given some code that does not adhere to this discipline, and it does not exit cleanly. I suspect that the code somewhere leaves an open socket, but the code is minified so its not that easy to find the point where this socket is opened.p  pMy question is, is there a way I can query nodejs to find out which sockets are open By seeing such a list with ip numbers and such I could start digging to find out where the code is that opens them.p

Negative 35203 pIm trying to update my plugins from the gcc4.8.3 to the 4.9.1 version of GCC, the interface seems to have change abit and I dont understand a few basic things anymore. I didnt find any examples on GCC documentation about plugins or internet on how to register a pass with the new interface. I just want to install a new pass in my plugin, so Im filling the structure registerpassinfo and pass it to the registercallback this way p  precode        registercallbackmyplugin name, PLUGINPASSMANAGERSETUP, NULL, amppassinfo codepre  pI dont understand how to fill the field pass of the structure registerpassinfo. It seems now this field is a optpass class and not a simple structure anymore, same class as the internal pass of GCC. So I naturally tried to copy what the internals pass are doing to create a new pass, I did this for my pass p  precodeclass passgreg  public gimpleoptpass  public   passgreg gcccontext ctxt      gimpleoptpass passdatagreg, gcccontext ctxt       bool gate   return greggate    unsigned int execute   return gregpass     codepre  pbut I dont undertand what is this parameter gcccontext that I need to instantiate my pass. Moreover the optpass symbole is defined in passmanager which include a passinstances.def that is not in the plugin APIp  pMaybe some of you have a little example to put me back on track, or point me to some docs that I missed.p

Negative 35203 pI have Activit1 A1 and Activity2 A2. Hierarchically A1 is A2s parent. I have deeplink at webpage to A2. My intention is that if you tap on deeplink then it takes you to A2 and then if you press back it will take you to A1 for obvious reasons the A1 may or may not be instantiated. To make it work my A1 has launchModesingleTask, so I can launch A1 when I am finishing A2 and it will get started if needed.p  pBUT, this results to strange behaviour that if I have A1 in background and I tap on deeplink which is pointed to A2 the app gets to the foreground with A1 visible. A2 wasnt started and deeplink was not consumed in any way.p  pIs not instantiated when you have the app killed. So deeplink is launching whole app only with A2. And is instantiated when you had app in background and system didnt destroy A1s instance.p  pThank youp

Negative 35203 pI got 2 threads in my program. 1 is handling a GUI and the other is doing some word automation. Lets call them GUIThread and WorkerThread.p  pThe WorkerThread is looping through methods using recursion. The WorkerThread is only alive while doing the word automation and the user must be able to stop the word automation. Therefore I have implemented a Stop button on the GUI which simply killsterminates the WorkerThread. However if I kill the WorkerThread while its in the middle of a method it sometimes causes a problem in my word document this is a longer story and thats why I want to check if the WorkerThread has finishedreturned from a method before I kill it.p  pThis is what my code does when I hit the Stop buttonp  precodeStops the worker thread  stops word automation in process workerThread.Abort  This blocks the thread until the workerThread has aborted while workerThread.IsAlive  codepre  pMy own suggestionworkaround for the problem was to have a global variable I could set each time the WorkerThread entered and left a method but this doesnt seem right to me. I mean I think there must be an easier way to deal with it.p

Negative 35203 pIm using JSDT to debug js codes embedded in a html file. I have problems debugging in IE and Chromeit works well in firefoxp  pI debug it stepbystep by clicking step into, the browsers UI is supposed to reactbecause my js codes modify the DOM treep  phowever, the browsers UI dosent change at all, until I reach some special code alert, for example or reach the end of the codesp  pIn other words, the modifications of UI are delayed.p  pI guess that when the JS process is running, the browsers UI process will be blocked, any modifications of UI from js will be appended to a queue, when JS reaches alert, the js process will be forced to pause and hang up, meanwhile the UI process will deal with the queue, renew every modifications of UI.p  pMy question is Is there any way to force the Browser to deal with the queue and renew UI during debuggingthe js is running. I have come up some bad idea rewrite the alert , make it an automatically close alert so that It wont annoy me, and append it to every line by modifying the JSDT source code.p  pbut I dont know how to create such alert some material lead me to setTimeout, but I dont understand.

Negative 35203 pIm using jsoncpp to manipulate a JSON string. Having parsed the string into a JsonValue I want to access and possibly change one of the nested objects if it exists. If the nested object doesnt exist I dont want it to be created. p  pLooking at the a hrefhttpjsoncpp.sourceforge.netclassjson11value.html relnofollowjson documentationa it seems that the only way to return a  reference to an object is via operator[]. p  precodeValueamp operator[] const char key codepre  pAccess an object value by name, create a null member if it does not exist. p  precodeconst Valueamp operator[] const char key const codepre  pAccess an object value by name, returns null if there is no member with that name. p  pI need something that combines the semantics of both of these I want a mutable reference, but one that doesnt involve creating an object if it doesnt already exist. I understand why the JsonValue interface is designed the way it is returning a mutable reference would expose its internal null object.p  pThe only clean way I can see is to use JsonValueisMember to determine whether the object exists, and then use Valueamp operator[] to access the object. But this involves two O log N  lookups instead of one, which I might want to avoid. p  pShort of an ugly constcast, is there any sensible way of doing what I want p

Negative 35203 pIm working on a platformerfighting game, and until now I have used mostly rects for all my collisions which was adequate, however, now Im trying to implement fighting mechanics which involves detecting if a characters attack has landed. For this purpose, rects arent really accurate enough anymore, so I decided to use masks instead.  To keep things efficint I figured it was best to create the masks while the sprite images are being loaded. and keep the masks as an attribute of my player function.  So right now I have a nested dictionary called sprites which has the following structure p  precodesprites  statei images tupleimages, masks tuplemasks codepre  pThis is used in my animation function which updates the image and the mask attribute of my player sprite according to the state its in. So far so good, I thought. One thing I overlooked though is that the masks Im creating during load time are positioned in the corner of the window and doesnt move along with the image of the sprite.  Now I was wondering if theres a way to move a mask along with the image or rect attribute of a sprite without having to recompute the whole thing everytime, since the shape remains constant for a given frame of the animation. p

Negative 35203 pI currently have a codeGroupBoxcode, which holds a codePanelcode, which holds multiple codeTableLayoutPanelcode controls. The reason i want to do this is so that i can place headers, buttons and options between the table layout panels, but have everything in the codeGroupBoxcode seem to be scrollable even though the codePanelcode is the one handling the scrolling. p  pA perfect example of this is the Advanced Settings for an Application Pool in IIS7... sorry i cant really put this visual into text more than that.p  pThe problem I am having is that the codePanelcode simply does not want to enable its AutoScroll even when there are codeTableLayoutPanelcode s that very obviously go beyond the bottom of the codePanelcode itself. However, if i place a codeLabelcode there instead, it works.p  pIs there a reason why this is happening Should there be some setting set for the codeTableLayoutPanelcode in order to have it register in the codePanelcode control p

Negative 35203 pIn my WPF application, I have a few places that based on a given ID of a record, I call a new form to be displayed as modal to view details.  It then closes and returns back to calling source as expected.

This prevents the need of every place that this form being called requires something like..p  precodevar myModalForm  new MyModalFormsomeIdToDisplay myModalForm.ShowDialog codepre  pSimplified, I just need to create the modal form with the Id, such as p  precodenew MyModalFormsomeIdToDisplay codepre  pBut through the ReSharper inspector, it comes back with Possible unassigned object created by new expression.p  pI know the garbage collector will get it when its finished, but being a modal form, once its done, I dont need to do anything else with it.

Negative 35203 pWe have a web portal were currently building to be able to view SQL reports for our organization.  At present, the portal uses a PHP script and the MS SQLSRV driver for making queries to our numerous SQL databases.  Essentially, the portal works by calling stored procedures which weve created that return the requested data.  The website then parses the data and presents the user with the information they requested.  This process works for all of our existing reports except for one which Im currently struggling to make work.p  pThe problematic stored procedurereport uses a user defined table type to ultimately make a codeWHERE INcode type clause at the end of the script in order to select against the provided account numbers.p  pIm painfully aware that the SQLSRV drivers does not support sending over a user defined table type so instead Ive got a working function which takes an input string in a CSV format and returns a table with the data.  This portion works and I can pass it a string of account numbers and it successfully parses them out into individual rows.  If I call this remotely, I get the results expected.  If I provide 4 account numbers, I get my table filled with 4 rows as it should.p  pAn example of the input string would bep  blockquote   pA00000000001,A00000000002,A00000000003,A00000000004p blockquote  pThis scriptstored procedure works fine if I run it manually from MS SQL Server Management Studio and feed it the same string giving me a row for each account number provided as expected.  I can also manually run the script from Mgmt Studio with the string hard coded into the script and I get the same results indicating the script works as it should. The problem though, is that when the stored procedure is executed remotely, only the last row is returned, and its always the last account number in the stringconverted table.  To make matters worse, If I run the SQL Trace Profiler, I can see the requests being made, I can see that its inserting my account numbers into my table type and doing so for every account sent over, but when the Trace Profiler shows the actual stored procedure, only the one row is returned...p  pI had thought the issue was in my PHP script, but seeing that the trace profiler is only capturing one row as well makes me think there is something happening with the stored procedure when run remotely...p  pHeres a trimmed version of the SQL without all the fields to save spacep  precodeUSE [Livendb] GO  Object  StoredProcedure [dbo].[cejnsqip]    Script Date 05252015 122419  SET ANSINULLS ON GO SET QUOTEDIDENTIFIER ON GO ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[cejnsqip] acctList varcharMAX AS  Split our comma separated list that was sent over so we can convert it to an array  DECLARE acctNumList acctNumlisttbltype INSERT INTO acctNumListAccountNumber SELECT Data FROM [dbo].[cejSplitCommaList]acctList, ,   Call to function to split csv into table   SELECT     ...     ...     ...

Negative 35203 pContext An existing system that is heavily based on passing XML around in various forms XmlDocument, XDocumentXElement, string encoded. We are developing a new component that will talk to the existing system and will have its own data store of some kind for holding XML for later processing. MongoDB seems like a good fit for the data store but it doesnt have native support for XML, so Im wondering what good options exist for handling XML in MongoDB. p  pThere are two options that come to mindp  pstrong1. Use an XML to JSON converter for conversion in both directionsstrongp  pI believe this will allow querying of the data and the creation on MongoDB indexes. There isnt an immediate need to do lots of querying or lots of different types of querying, but we would at the very least have to do some key based retrieval and maybe one or two queries on the values would be useful certainly useful to keep that option open.p  pIs a generic XML2JSON converter a good fit here, or would a MongoDBBSON converter be betterp  pAre there any specific downsides to converting to JSONBSON Could it ever result in loss of information, perhaps whitespace in blocks of element space could get mangledp  pstrong2. String or binary encode the XML and store it as a BSON byte array.strongp  pProsp  ul liSimple.li ul  pConsp  ul liData becomes opaque to querying.li ul  pAre there additional proscons to the above two options Are there other options available Is this sane e.g. is there a better fit for this problem than MongoDBp  pstrong UPDATE strongp  pA working demo that uses Newtonsoft.Json for the XML to JSON conversion...p  precodeXElement fooElem  XElement.Loadfoo.xml  Note. I used Formatting.Indented to make the JSON easily readable for debug purposes, otherwise it just adds unnecessary whitespace characters. string jsonStr  JsonConvert.SerializeXNodefooElem, Formatting.Indented BsonDocument bsonDoc  BsonDocument.ParsejsonStr codepre  pFrom there you can just call MongoDB as usual, e.g.p  precodeawait collection.InsertOneAsyncbsonDoc codepre  pThis is probably an OKacceptable solution in my particular case, but more generally it has the overhead of converting to and then parsing a JSON string, which is unnecessary work.

For example when the optioncode of O is in the combinations the optioncode of ON and OP are not allowed to be in the combination.p  pThe only rowmod info that needs to be followed currently when building these strings is the naWithOp as that refers to another option that is not allowed to be with it.p  pSome of the possible combinations that would need to come out of the script would bep  ol liOTKZli liOTKli liOTli liOTOSZli liOTOSli liOli liOLli liOLKZli liOLKli ol  pI know this isnt even close to the exhaustive list of how many are actually possible but I cant figure out how to generate all the possible combinations.p  hr  precodeArray      [0] gt Array                      [optioncode] gt O             [rowmod] gt allowAll naWithOpON naWithOpOP               [1] gt Array                      [optioncode] gt ON             [rowmod] gt allowAll naWithOpO naWithOpOP               [2] gt Array                      [optioncode] gt OP             [rowmod] gt allowAll naWithOpO naWithOpON               [3] gt Array                      [optioncode] gt T             [rowmod] gt allowAll naWithOpL               [4] gt Array                      [optioncode] gt L             [rowmod] gt allowAll naWithOpT naWithCoilX               [5] gt Array                      [optioncode] gt K             [rowmod] gt allow2 allow3 allow3P naWithOpOS               [6] gt Array                      [optioncode] gt OS             [rowmod] gt allow2 allow3 allow3P naWithOpK               [7] gt Array                      [optioncode] gt Z             [rowmod] gt allowAll naWithPreB            codepre  pBasically I must start on the first option code and iterate down the list starting with the first given option O then go to the next option ON and check whether its valid and if it is then add it to the current combination.

Negative 35203 pIm doing an unity project that is an AR game played with mobile devices. It uses vuforia for the AR part. Recently I added Google Analytics for Unity the googleanalyticsv3.unitypackage from the developer site. After that, when I try to build on iOS, I get a lot of Apple MachO Linker errors Android still builds just fine. I was able to remove some of them by adding the necessary frameworks, but I still have around 50 of them. I added libsqlite3.dylib, libz.dylib, SystemConfiguration.framework and CoreData.framework. I then also added security.framework which also seemed to reduce errors on the build. I then went back a few commits on the project, before I added the Analytics, and it was still building fine on the same Unity and Xcode versions.p  pPasted below are the errors I getp

I have also build this same project 4 times cleanly, in a new folder each time, added the frameworks, removing them and adding them again.

Creating a method inside the codeurls.pycode and codeviews.pycode in addition to create a template html file seems the wrong attempt.p  pI already thought about building a big controller and did some googleing but i could not find what i was looking for.p  pIs there something like a best practice to achieve that How do you guys handle the amount of templatesp  pAny advice would be more than welcome p

It shows me the system build in chooser from the emulator and when I choose the browser, it openes the Uri.p  pErrorMessagep  precode0911 110630.057    60706070 Ddalvikvm Not lateenabling CheckJNI   already on 0911 110630.088    60706070course.labs.intentslab Ddalvikvm       GCFORALLOC freed 164K, 18 free 2795K3404K, paused 1ms, total 3ms 0911 110630.138    60706070course.labs.intentslab DlibEGL loaded    systemlibegllibEGLemulation.so 0911 110630.138    60706070course.labs.intentslab DlibEGL loaded systemlibegllibGLESv1CMemulation.so 0911 110630.138    60706070course.labs.intentslab DlibEGL loaded systemlibegllibGLESv2emulation.so 0911 110630.138    60706070course.labs.intentslab D HostConnectionget New Host Connection established 0xb9579ef0, tid 6070 0911 110630.189    60706070course.labs.intentslab WEGLemulation eglSurfaceAttrib not implemented 0911 110630.189    60706070course.labs.intentslab DOpenGLRenderer Enabling debug mode 0 0911 110631.807    60706070course.labs.intentslab ILabIntents Entered startImplicitActivation 0911 110631.807    60706070course.labs.intentslab ILabIntents Chooser Intent Actionandroid.intent.action.CHOOSER 0911 110631.988    60706070course.labs.intentslab WChooseActivity Target is not an intent null 0911 110631.988    60706070course.labs.intentslab DAndroidRuntime Shutting  down VM 0911 110631.988    60706070course.labs.intentslab Wdalvikvm threadid1 thread exiting with uncaught exception group0xb181c678 0911 110631.988    60706070course.labs.intentslab EAndroidRuntime FATAL EXCEPTION main android.app.SuperNotCalledException Activity androidcom.android.internal.app.ChooserActivity did not call through to super.onCreate         at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivityActivityThread.java2177         at android.app.ActivityThread.handleLaunchActivityActivityThread.java2261         at android.app.ActivityThread.access600ActivityThread.java141         at android.app.ActivityThreadH.handleMessageActivityThread.java1256         at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessageHandler.java99         at android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java137         at android.app.ActivityThread.mainActivityThread.java5103         at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNativeNative Method         at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java525         at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.runZygoteInit.java737         at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.mainZygoteInit.java553         at dalvik.system.NativeStart.mainNative Method codepre  pJava Functionp  precodeprivate void startImplicitActivation       Intent baseIntent  new IntentIntent.ACTIONVIEW, Uri.parseURL      Intent chooserIntent  new Intent     chooserIntent.createChooserbaseIntent, Open Browser...      startActivitychooserIntent  codepre  pChooserActivity.java this is the ChooserActivity.java I found in the SDK Path.

Negative 35203 pI have an ASP.NET web API which was hosted using IIS, with IIS I was able to get the content of a .txt file just by making a get request to the root of the API a hrefhttplocalhostmyfile.txt relnofollowhttplocalhostmyfile.txta and it would return me the content of that file. After moving to use selfhosted in a windows service it is no longer able to return any content of the file and I am getting 404.
