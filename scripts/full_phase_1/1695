Positive 1695 pI need to add a column [newdate] that I will get from my [date] sql table to an existing table [returns] and create primary keys. This [returns] table already has 65 million records and while I could repopulate all of the data. What is the simplest way of doing this.p  pMy thoughts are to rename the table with a temporary name. Say [returnsold] and then drop and create my new table and assign my primary keys. I think then joining the [returnsold] with my [ddate] as I populate my new table would work.p
Positive 1695 pFor a few days, Ive been working on developing a Newsfeed using the Neo4j Graph Database and toying around with various ways of including an Activity Log similar to Facebook that will keep track of every user action.p  pFor example, User1 sends a friend request to User2 which would translate to something like this in Cypherp  precodeMATCH     meUser username john.snowgmail.com,      friendUser username arya.starkgmail.com  WHERE      NOT me[FRIENDSHIPUPDATE]FriendshipStatus[FRIENDSHIPUPDATE]friend  CREATE     me[FRIENDSHIPUPDATE]friendshipStatusFriendshipStatus status 0[FRIENDSHIPUPDATE]gtfriend  RETURN     me,     friendshipStatus,     friend codepre  pPretty basic stuff so far, just create 2 relationships and 1 node that contains all the information regarding their friendship.p  pRetrieving both outgoing and incoming events is also pretty simplep  precodeMATCH     meUser username john.snowgmail.com[actionName]gtactionData[]gtfriendUser  RETURN     me,     typeactionName AS actionName,     actionData,     friend  UNION MATCH     meUserlt[actionName]actionDatalt[]friendUser  RETURN     me,     typeactionName AS actionName,     actionData,     friend codepre  pBut, lets say User2 declines User1 friend request, which would end up deleting the entire relationship between them. No problem... for a simple notification panel like you have one friend request, the other cancels the friend request, oups, no friend requests. So, no history.p  pLike I said, Im planning to do something like the Facebook Activity Log.p  precodegt You liked [User]slink to the user [Photo]link to the photo at [Time]. gt [User]link to user declined your friend request at [Time]. gt You sent [User]link to user a friend request at [Time] codepre  pIve toyed with various ways of doing this, including linked lists, down to the day. The days would then contain the events the user performed or has been exposed to in that particular day when creating an event, it is pushed to the friend timeline also  see the second code block and keeping direct relationships between user friendship updates, likes, etc for speed so I dont have to search thru all the Day nodes. p  pEdit Forgot to mention why I didnt stick with that particular design.p  pThe problem was that there was no similarity between the actions for example a like is directed to a post while a friendship request is directed to a user, which made me end up with multiple, unwanted joins.p  pWhat would be a good database design to keep track of all these actions, even if they get deletedp  pThank you in advance.p

Positive 1695 pI was building an Application where I need to sync users phone contacts. Now since a phone contact in users phonebook have N different fields, such as codenamecode, codecontactcode, codework contactcode, codeemailcode, codeemail2code, codewebsitecode and various other fields.p  pNow, lets suppose I User1 have a friend with name N1 having phone numbers P1 and P2 with emails E1 and E2. Now another user User2 having the contact of the same user but with different name N2 having phone only P1 and email E1.p  pCurrently I was thinking about the following schemap  precodeContacts id phone email website address  UserContacts userid contactslist of contacts codepre  pI need to make sure that the details that User1 has of friend should not be shared with User2, because User1 has P1P2 both and E1E2 both but User2 has only P1E1. Also, the name will be same across all the users, which is obviously not required.p  pHence, now I was thinking to dump every contact of every user into the table,ie having duplicates. Im using mongDB hence I dont mind having duplicates, but still I would like to know that how can I prevent data redundancy thereby also making sure that the information is not shared by the other users.p

Positive 1695 pIm starting a new project a survey application and I chose RethinkDB as my database however, I have some questions about data modelling. Im going to have questions that can be answered only once by each user. Moreover Ill have reports that will tell the percentage of users that chose each option. At first I thought of the following modelling p  pcode   title String,   totalanswers Number,   options [     value Number,     label String,     respondents [User IDs]   ]  codep  pThe problem is that RethinkDB suggests embedding only a few hundred items on an Array and Ill probably have 500 respondents per survey.  The other option is to create an codeanswerscode table and link to the question id and option but reports queries may be a problem as Ill have many questions per survey.p  pWhich path should I follow  Thanksp
Positive 1695 pIm working on a web app and I have to design its database. Theres a part that didnt come very straightforward to me, so after some thinking and research I came with multiple ideas.

There are 2 types of teachers, according to the relations with their Fields and Subjectsp  ol liA Teacher thats related to a Field, the Field is obligatory related to a Category li liA Teacher thats not related to a Field, but directly to a Categoryli ol  pMy initial idea was to have two nullable foreign keys, one to the table Field, and the other to the table Category. But in this case, how can I make sure that exactly one is null, and the other one is notp  pThe other idea is to create a hierarchy, with two types of Teacher tables derived from the table Teacher isa relation, but I couldnt find any useful tutorial on this.p  pIm developing the app using Django with SQLite dbp
Positive 1695 pI have multiple tables in Access which, are loading lists for various air crafts catering areas on packing lists.p  pThe packing lists have columns which, contain position, items that go in that position, quantities of items, updates for that positionp  pEach aircrafts packing list is determined by mileage, city pair and flight time.p  pThere are approximately thirty aircraft, each having about 1020 packing lists eachdepending on the mileage, city pair and flight time. p  pWhat I want to do is import our packing lists, and compare them to the third party airlines packing lists to make sure they match.  The third party client often changes items in positions, and it is impossible for us to manually check each aircraft packing list to make sure they match.  p  pIm trying to figure out a way to do a mass cross reference of the clients packing lists to ours, to make sure things match.  p  pRight now we are going by change notices from the client and pulling position updates by effective date from their system, but sometimes they make updates without telling us or making notations on their packing lists, and we get tickets because things dont match.p  pI hope that is clear.  Please let me know if its not, and Ill adjust the explanation.p

For examplep  pSay a particular process for a certain product, say welding, theoretically takes about 10 seconds to do the process cycle time. Due to various issues, the machines actual cycle time would vary throughout the day. I would like to store the machines actual cycle time throughout the day and analyze it over time days, weeks, months. How would i go about designing the database for this p  pI considered using a time series database, but i figured it isnt suitable  cycle time data has a start time and an end time  basically im measuring time performance over time  if this even makes sense. At the same time, I was also worried that using relational database to store and then displayanalyze time related data is inefficient. p  pAny thoughts on a good database structure would be greatly appreciated. Let me know if any more info is needed and i will gladly edit this questionp
Positive 1695 pIm looking at the examplep  precodeSELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate FROM Orders INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerIDCustomers.CustomerID codepre  pfrom W3Schools and am wondering how Im supposed to group the clauses in my mind. From what I understand, every SQL query returns a table, and clauses within the query may themselves return a table. So I think of the whole p  precodeOrders INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerIDCustomers.CustomerID codepre  pas being a table and Im returning a subtable of it by applying codeSELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDatecode to it. Is that the right way to think about things p

Positive 1695 pIm new in Rails and am working on a problem. I have two tables  p  pShoes and Socks  p  pA Shoe can have many Socks, but only one active Sock.  Other Socks are inactive.  All Socks are also unique with unique patterns.  I want to make sure I dont have socks with the same pattern. I think I can do this three waysp  p1 Using an additional column in table socks to represent the active sockp  precodeclass Shoe lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany socks end  class Sock lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto shoe end  class CreateGettingDressed lt ActiveRecordMigration   def change     createtable shoes do t       t.string size       t.timestamps null false     end      createtable socks do t       t.belongsto shoe, indextrue       t.string pattern       t.boolean active       t.timestamps null false     end   end end codepre  pThis seems fairly simple, but cumbersome.  I would search socks with shoeid, and pull out the activesock and return its pattern.  I think I would index [activesock, shoeid] in an array to speed it up.p  p2 Using an additional table to archive inactive socksp  precodeclass Shoe lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany socks   hasmany inactivesocks end  class Sock lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto Shoe end  class Inactivesock lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto Shoe end  class CreateGettingDressed lt ActiveRecordMigration   def change     createtable shoes do t       t.string name       t.timestamps null false     end      createtable socks do t       t.belongsto shoe, indextrue       t.string pattern       t.timestamps null false     end       createtable inactivesocks do t       t.belongsto shoe, indextrue       t.string pattern       t.timestamps null false     end   end end codepre  pThis seems cumbersome as well, but when you are just dealing with active socks easy to use and fast.  But when buying a new sock, I have to check the pattern with both tables.p  p3 Using a hasmany through relationshipp  precodeclass Shoe lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany activesocks   hasmany socks, through activesocks  end  class ActiveSock lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto Shoe   belongsto Sock end  class Sock lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany activesocks   hasmany shoes, through activesocks end  class CreateGettingDressed lt ActiveRecordMigration   def change     createtable shoes do t       t.string name       t.timestamps null false     end      createtable socks do t       t.string pattern       t.timestamps null false    end      createtable activesocks do t       t.belongsto shoe, index true       t.belongsto sock, index true       t.string pattern       t.boolean active       t.timestamps null false     end   end end codepre  pThis seems like option 2, but I feel like Im using Rails tools to make it less cumbersome.  When Im searching for patterns Im just checking the socks table, when Im searching for the one activesock Im just searching activesocks table.p  pIve read up on similar posts, and it seems options 1 and 2 are commonly used in closedaccounts, banning users, banning posts, archiving etc. Situations where you need to differentiate data that is only slightly different. The choice there seems to be look at what you need and choose the option 1 or 2 that best fits you.  p  pMy understanding for hasmany through situations seems to be when you have a relationship and you need extra meta data you can use it.  I think that fits this situation.p  pDid I set up option 1 correctly and am I right that indexing the array of [shoeid and active] will give me a faster search Is option 3 an appropriate use of hasmany through  Would my explanation of option 3 workp
Positive 1695 pCurrently scoping out a new system. Like many systems, it will be required to store documents and link them to other kinds of item. In this instance a codeDocumentcode object can belong to a codeJobcode or it can belong to an codeItemcode which in turn belongs to a Job.p  pWe could do this by having a JobId and an ItemId against a codeDocumentcode and leaving one or the other blank if necessary, but thats going to mean annoying conditional logic in the handling code. So, two link tables seems a better idea.p  pHowever, it is likely that we will need to link codeDocumentscode to other items in the system at some point in the future. There are codeCompanycode and codeUsercode objects, for example, and we might want to record codeDocumentscode against those. There may be more.p  pThat would entail a proliferation of link tables which, while effective, is messy and hard to follow.p  pThis solution is in SQL Server and will be handled in code via Entity Framework.p  pAre there any design principles that can allow us to hook up codeDocumentcode objects with a variety of other system objects as required in a neater and more flexible wayp
Positive 1695 pI am trying to come up with a theoretical solution to an NxN problem for data aggregation and storage. As an example I have a huge amount of data that comes in via a stream. The stream sends the data in points. Each point has 5 dimensionsp  blockquote   ol   liLocationli   liDate li   liTimeli   liNameli   liStatisticsli   ol blockquote  pThis data then needs to be aggregated and stored to allow another user to come along and query the data for both location and time. The user should be able to query like the following pseudocodep  blockquote   pShow me aggregated statistics for Location 1,2,3,4,....N between Dates 01012011 and 01032011 between times 11am and 4pmp blockquote  pUnfortunately due to the scale of the data it is not possible to aggregate all this data from the points on the fly and so aggregation prior to this needs to be done. As you can see though there are multiple dimensions that the data could be aggregated on.p  pThey can query for any number of days or locations and so finding all the combinations would require huge preaggregationp  blockquote   ul   liRecord for Locations 1 Todayli   liRecord for Locations 1,2 Todayli   liRecord for Locations 1,3 Todayli   liRecord for Locations 1,2,3 Todayli   lietc... up to Nli   ul blockquote  pPreprocessing all of these combinations prior to querying could result in an amount of precessing that is not viable. If we have 200 different locations then we have 2200 combinations which would be nearly impossible to precompute in any reasonable amount of time.p  pI did think about creating records on 1 dimension and then merging could be done on the fly when requested, but this would also take time at scale.p  pQuestionsp  ol liHow should I go about choosing the right dimension andor combination of dimensions given that the user is as likely to query on all dimensionsli liAre there any case studies I could refer to, books I could read or anything else you can think of that would helpli ol  pThank you for your time.p  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pWhen I say aggregating the data together I mean combining the statistics and name dimensions 4 amp 5 for the other dimensions. So for example if I request data for Locations 1,2,3,4..N then I must merge the statistics and counts of name together for those N Locations before serving it up to the user. p  pSimilarly if I request the data for dates 01012015  01122015 then I must aggregate all data between those periods by adding summing namestatistics.p  pFinally If I ask for data between dates 01012015  01122015 for Locations 1,2,3,4..N then I must aggregate all data between those dates for all those locations.p  pFor the sake of this example lets say that going through statistics requires some sort of nested loop and does not scale well especially on the fly.p

I think subjects should have their own table. p  pemGradings  StudentName, Subject Code, Exam, Gradeemp  pemSubjects  Subject Code, SubjectNameemp  pBut 2NF does not produce this. 3NF is about dependencies between nonprime attributes so it does not produce this either.

Positive 1695 pI want to store daily fund data for approximately 2000 funds over 20 years or more. At first I figured I would just create one giant table with one column per fund and one row per date. I ran into trouble trying to create this table and also realise that a table like that would have a lot of NULL values almost half the values would be NULL.p  pIs there a more efficient way of structuring the table or database for quickly finding and fetching the data for a specific fund over hundreds or thousands of daysp  pThe alternative way Ive thought of doing this is with three columns date, fundid, fundvalue.

A strongidentifying relationship is one that connects a strong entity to a weak entity that is, an entity that contains the primary key [PK] of its related entity as a component of its own component, and is indicated by a solid line. p  pFor example, consider this diagram borrowed from a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions16675127howtoidentifyastrongvsweakrelationshiponerdanother postapli ol  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comWqj4M.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWqj4M.png altsample ERDap  pThe relationship between Course strong entity and Class weak entity is a strong relationship solid line because Class contains Courses PK CID as part of its own PK CID,Date. In contrast, the relationship between Room strong entity and Class even though it is a weak entity is weak because Rooms PK RID is not part of Classs PK.p  ol start2 listrongUnaryrecursive relationshipstrong Most relationships are binary, in that they connect two separate entities. For example, the relationships between Course and Class, and between Room and Class, are binary relationships. Rarely, you have a unary also called recursive relationship when an entity has a relationship with itself. In the diagram, the only unary relationship is the one with the Employee entity. It should be labelled manages, because it represents the fact that one Employee might manage 0 to many Employees and every Employee is managed by 1 and only 1 Employee. The PK of Employee is EmpID, and the foreign key FK that links the relationship is Manager.li ol  pSo, heres my question Is a unary relationship strongidentifying or weaknonidentifying The PK of the one side Employee, EmpID is not only part of, but is the full constituent of the PK on the many side again, Employee, EmpID. So, that would indicate that it should be a strong relationship, with a solid line, contrary to what is depicted in the sample diagram. Could anyone please clarify this for mep

Negative 1695 pSo, one commonly heard comment when talking about performance is that you write your code with whatever language gets the job done fastest. If performance in specific areas is a problem, then rewrite those bits in CC.p  pBut, what if youre starting with a native C app What options do you have if you want to write the easy bits, or refactor the old bits, in a language like Python, Ruby, C, or whatever Keep in mind that transferring data between the native and other sides is a must. Being able to simply call a function written in an easier language, while passing C classes as data, would be beautiful.p  pWeve got a crusty Win32 app that would benefit greatly if we could crank out new code, or refactor old code, in C or something. Very little of it requires the complexity of C, and dealing with the little fiddly bits is dragging down the programming process. p

Negative 1695 pThis question originally asked which is the best method for uploading files via SFTP or FTPS in SSIS.  It now just lists the pros and cons of each solution.  I personally use CozyRocs SFTP library these days, but Ive used each of the below solutions at one point or another.p  pSSIS COMPONENT LIBRARYp  pMethod Install a SSIS component library from a hrefhttpwww.cozyroc.comsupportssishome.htmlCozyRoca, a hrefhttpssissftp.codeplex.comCodeplexa, a hrefhttpwww.eldos.combizcryptossissftpconnectiontask.phpBizCryptoa, a hrefhttppragmaticworks.comProductsBusinessIntelligenceTaskFactorySSISFTPSSFTPTask.aspxPragmaticWorksa, or some other vendor on each development and production server and use the SFTP task to upload the files.p  pPros Easy to use.  It looks, smells, and feels like a normal SSIS task.  SSIS also recognizes the password as sensitive information and allows you all the normal options for protecting the sensitive information instead of just storing it in clear text in a nonsecure manner.  Works well with other SSIS tasks such as ForEach Loop Containers.  Errors out when uploads and downloads fail.  Works well when you dont know the names of the files on the remote FTP site to download or when you wont know the name of the file to upload until runtime.p  pCons With the exception of the Codeplex solution, this costs money to license in a production environment.  Requires installing the libraries on each development and production machine.  If it is the Codeplex solution, then you are using software that isnt supported by any specific vendor.  This also makes you dependent upon the vendor to update their libraries between each version.  For instance, before 2008 RTMd, I was developing a new server on a CTP version of 2008 and the CozyRoc 2005 library was incompatible with it.  Eventually they released a 2008 compatible version, but I had to temporarily use the command line solution to work around this issue.  p  pCOMMAND LINE SFTP PROGRAMp  pMethod Install a free commandline SFTP application such as Putty and WinSCP and execute it either by running a batch file or operating system process task.  Instructions for doing this via WinSCP are listed a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comKBdatabaseSSISSFTP.aspxherea.p  pPros Free, free, and free.  You can be sure it is secure if you are using Putty since numerous GUI FTP clients appear to use Putty under the covers.  You DEFINATELY know you are using SSH2 and not SSH.p  pCons The two commandline utilities I tried Putty and Cygwin required storing the SFTP password in a nonsecure location.  I havent found a good way to capture failures or errors when uploading files.  The process doesnt look and smell like SSIS.  Most of the code is encapsulated in text files instead of SSIS itself.  Difficult to use if you dont know the exact name of the file you are uploading or downloading.p  pA 3RD PARTY C or VB.NET LIBRARYp  pMethod Install a SFTP or FTPS library and use a Script Task that references the library to upload the files.  Ive never tried this, so Im going to guess at the pros and consp  pPros Probably easy to capture errors.  Should work well with variables, so it would probably be easy to use even when you dont know the exact name of the file you are uploading or downloading.p  pCons Its a script task combined with .NET libraries.  If you are using SSIS, then you probably are more comfortable with SSIS tasks then .NET code.  Script tasks are also difficult to troubleshoot since they dont have the same debugging tools and features as regular .NET projects.  Creates a dependency on 3rd party code that may not work between different versions of SQL Server.  To be fair, it is probably MORE likely to work between different versions of SQL Server than a 3rd party SSIS task library.  Another huge con  I havent found a free C or VB.NET library that does this as of yet.  So if anyone knows of one, then please let me knowp
Negative 1695 pI am wondering if there are any additional optimizations I can implement to improve the speed of reflective invocations in Java.

Negative 1695 pI have a systemwide manual reset event that I create by doing the followingp  precodeEventWaitHandle notifyEvent  new EventWaitHandlefalse, EventResetMode.ManualReset, notifyEventName, out createdEvent codepre  pSeveral processes create this event e.g. it is shared amongst them. It is used for notifying when something gets updated.p  pId like to be able to set this event so that all of processes waiting on it are signaled and then immediately reset it so that subsequent Waits on the event are blocked.p  pIf I do ap  precodenotifyEvent.Set notifyEvent.Reset codepre  pIt will sometimes notify all listening processes.p  pIf I do a p  precodenotifyEvent.Set Thread.Sleep0 notifyEvent.Reset codepre  pMore processes get notified I assumed this would happen since the scheduler has a chance to run.p  pAnd if I dop  precodenotifyEvent.Set Thread.Sleep100 notifyEvent.Reset codepre  pThen everything seems to work out fine and all processes e.g. 8 get notified consistently. I dont like the use of a magic number for the Sleep call. p  pIs there a better way to notify all listeners of an OS event in other processes that an event has occurred so that everyone listening to it at the time of notification receive the event signal and then immediately reset the event so that anyone else that goes to listen to the event will blockp  pstrongUPDATEstrong A Semaphore doesnt seem to be a good fit here since the number of listeners to the event can vary over time. It is not known in advance how many listeners there will be when an even needs to be notified. p
Negative 1695 pIs there a tool to importconvert COM type libraries into C code rather than generating an assembly The TLBIMP tool and the TypeLibaryConverter class only generate assemblies.p  pIve had some success ripping the C codeComImportcode definitions by running Reflector over the generated Interop assembly and copying a pasting the disassembled source, but this usually requires quite a bit of manual patching up before itll compile. p  pDesired goal is a single EXE without satellite Interop DLLs, so perhaps the answer is to use ILMerge to effectively embed the interop DLL in the EXE.p  pI was sure in the past Id come across such a tool  but maybe it dreamt it p
Negative 1695 pI am thinking is that a good idea to define exception with template. Defining different types of exception is a super verbose task.

Negative 1695 pI want to write a program that analyzes your fantasy baseball team and notifies you of recommended actions, possibly multiple times per day.  The problem is, you arent playing fantasy baseball on my site, youre playing on yahoo, or cbs, or espn, etc.p  pOn the majority of these sites, fantasy teams and leagues are not public, so you must be logged in and a member of the league to see the teams in the league.p  pAll that I need is the plain html for the team page on each of those sites to be sent to my server, where I can then parse and analyze the file and send user notifications.p  pThe problem is that I need usernamepassword combinations to easily get this data to my server emwhenem I need it, and I think there will be a lot of people who wouldnt want to entrust their yahooespncbs password to me.p  pI have come up with several possible ways to solve this problemp  ol lipThe most obvious way is to ask for their credentials for the site on which their team is hosted.  Then I could just programmatically log in and request the data I need.  Im guessing a number of people would be comfortable giving me their credentials, and a number of them not so much.pli lipWrite a desktop client, which the user then downloads.  The client would require their credentials, but it could then basically do exactly the same thing that the server based version would do, log in, request the page, and send the page back to my server.  The difference being that their password would never need to leave their desktop.  Their computer would need to be on, and this program running for this method to work.pli lipWrite browser addons that navigate to the page I need, use the cookie that is saved from a previous login to login to the site, and send the page back to my server.  This doesnt require my software to ever ask for their password, but if the cookie expires I am hosed, and I dont know much about browser addons besides.pli ol  pIm sure there are other options, but these are what Ive come up with so far.p  pI have two questions 1.  What are the other possibilities for this type of task 2.

Having looked now at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions526006postformswithyahoopipesthisa, I dont think that is an option.  So, it looks like Ill be going with option 1.p
Negative 1695 pWe are developing an backoffice application using Spring and Maven as configuration manager.

Negative 1695 pIve succeeded in getting WCF Transport security going for our Logon web service using a selfsigned certificate issued against localhost.  I added the selfsigned certificate as trusted root certificate authority to prevent IE about moaning about a nontrusted certificate.  When testing against localhost everything works fine and because we are using localhost it also allows all developers to test the service from their own machines without any problems.  p  pHowever, Im now trying to get this working on our remote testing server.  When running on the remote server, a localhost certificate is obviously not going to work anymore.  So I created a selfsigned test certificate for the server machine using IIS7 and setup IIS to use this certificate for https comms on the web site. I also added this to the servers trust root certificate authority store. I then change the WCFserver behaviour configuration to now strongnotstrong look for a localhost certificate anymore, but to find one tied to the DNS name of the machine as illustrated belowp  precodeltbehavior nameSSLgt   ltserviceCredentialsgt     ltserviceCertificate       findValueprodsbuild.mydomain.co.za       storeLocationLocalMachine       storeNameMy       x509FindTypeFindBySubjectName gt   ltserviceCredentialsgt ltbehaviorgt codepre  pThis behaviour is then linked to the Logon service in the web.config filep  precode  ltservice behaviorConfigurationSSL namePragma.OnKey.Services.Common.LogonServicegt     ltendpoint address bindingConfigurationpragmaSSL bindingbasicHttpBinding nameSilverlight contractPragma.OnKey.Services.Common.ILogonService gt   ltservicegt codepre  pFor reference I also include the binding configuration usedp  precode   ltbinding namepragmaSSLgt       ltsecurity modeTransportgt     ltbindinggt codepre  pWhen I run a test from a browser using the fully qualified domain name on the server machine itself, everyting works fine.

Negative 1695 pWe work with IBM products and we typically use IBM Http Servers read Apache as a reverse proxy for our application servers.

Negative 1695 pThis is a question about an authentication scheme.p  pSay I have a shared secret string S, and two computers, C1 and C2p  ul liComputer one C1 sends a random string R to computer two C2li liC2 hashes say SHA256 the concatenation of S and R SRli liC2 sends the hash of SR to C1, along with some instructionsli liC1 compares the received hash of SR with its own hash of SR and executes the instructions if they matchli liWash, rinse, repeat with different values of Rli ul  pNow, what I want to know is if someone intercepts a whole bunch of R values, and a whole bunch of SR hashes, can they use that as a crib to work out what S is, thus allowing them to forge instructionsp  pIm already aware of the potential for a MITM attack here attacker intercepts response, changes the instructions and forwards it on.p  pI honestly dont know what Im dealing with here, I only have a bit of historical knowledge about encryption but that included the use of cribs to break them.

Would I be better off just using S as a key for AES If I do that, can I still use this in the encrypted message to prevent replay attacksp  pAny and all advice welcome, I sort of deviated from my question at the end, so feel free to deviate in your answersp

Negative 1695 pI am writing a program that needs to set a window just abovebelow the traybar for gtk. I have tried using the 2 approaches that failed. One was using the gtkstatusiconpositionmenu function and placing the window in the point where the user clicks in the tray bar. The problem is that these solutions work in gnomeLinux but not in Windows. In Linux they work because the window manager doesnt seem to allow placement of windows in the tray panel, honoring the closest possible. In Windows this doesnt happen and the window can go out of the screen which understandably is not desired.p  pWith this said i went out for a work around. My idea was to set the window in the location of mouse click and get the x and y coordinates of a normal window placement and with its size check if it would be within the screen boundaries.

Negative 1695 pIve created a program that uses core data and it works beautifully.p  pIve since attempted to move all my core data methods calls and fetch routines into a class that is self contained.  My main program then instantiates that class and makes some basic method calls into that class, and the class then does all the core data stuff behind the scenes.  What Im running into, is that sometimes Ill find that when I grab a managed object from the context, Ill have a valid object, but its properties have been deallocated, and Ill cause a crash.  Ive played with the zombies and looked for memory leaks, and what I have gathered is it seems that the run loop is probably responsible for deallocating the memory, but Im not sure.p  pIs there a way to determine if that memory has been deallocated and force the core data to get it back if I need to access it  My managedObjectContext never gets deallocated, and the fetchedResultsController never does, either.  p  pI thought maybe I needed to use the [managedObjectContext refreshObjectmergeData] method, or the [managedObjectContext setRetainsRegisteredObjects] method.  Although, Im under the impression that last one may not be the best bet since it will be more memory intensive from what I understand.p  pThese errors only popped up when I moved the core data calls into another class file, and they are random when they show up.p  pAny insight would be appreciated.p  pRyanp

Negative 1695 pHow would you implement an APNS server that checks for new email and sends a push notification to an iPhone when one is detected  I am wondering more at an architectural level.  For the sake of simplicity, lets say were building a push server for gmail.  The challenges that I can see arep  ul lipHow do you continuously poll Gmail for potentially tens of thousands of unique email accounts for new mail  Would gmail even allow this from a single set of IPspli lipGmail has an IMAP and Inbox feed.  In order to detect if a new piece of mail has arrived, would you need to remember the last email that was received or pushed for each accountpli lipWould the CPU cycles and bandwidth required for this continuous polling make a cloud solution such as EC2 or RackSpace affordablepli lipHow do you handle authentication and authorization in a secure fashion  For example, I once used a gTalk client on my iPhone which had push notifications and Gmail warned me the next time that I logged in from the web interface that my account was accessed from an unusual IP.  Is there a way to avoid this  Would you store the users credentials on the server  An OAuth tokenpli ul  pI should mention that this is to please my personal curiosity but it might also be an interesting project for learning to program in Erlang.p  pAny insight on this would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1695 pI have a requirement for a project in an open source operating system, to use Maven completely offline under emnix environment. i.e. it should use the dependencies available in the system probably at usrshareem  few other places. Maven should not download any dependency from internet.p  pIs there a solution to achieve this Creating the M2 repo in the system is not a viable solution. The issue is that the file system is readonly. We can only work on a temporary folder tmp for example emwithem write access. But maintaining a repo at a temporary location is a bad design, isnt it  Saying it another way, the new to be installed maven project should use the existing packages in the system, if available. If packages does not exist, it should get installed separately  via the package manager, and should not be copied to the m2 repo.p  pIs there any known way to do thisp  pThanks for the helpp  pPS Please note that Im not asking about o option to take it offlinep

Negative 1695 pToday one of our clients sent a complaint that on his shop, some prices are a little lower 1, K precisely. When I started to debug, I thought this might be a rounding error. Were using SimpleXML to import products prices and from the look of the code, everything seemed about right, but when I did dome vardumps, some prices were really badly rounded. There is a ceil function which kept ceiling code54.6200code to code54code. I understand that I have to typecast all the SimpleXML values before using them, but this behavior seemed quite odd to me. It seems that when I ceil a floating point vlaue stored in a string node of SimpleXMLElement, the value gets typecasted to int before the ceil function. br br  Okay, thats something that I can live with, the script was programmed by somebody who probably didnt know that he needs to typecast everything from SimpleXML, but this still seems a bit odd to me.

When zooming out how ever to say a more global overview of the UK, the icon itself appears on the right of the M1  but no processing is happening to the markers during this phase  so it cannot be the marker moving.p  pIs this actually down to googles map images being slightly different at higher zoom levels, or is there something in the markers side of things that can affect thisp  pLike I said  everything IS working, it just seems a bit strange zooming in and seeing the map tiles change position slightly whereas the marker remains constantp  pCheersp

I would like it to display a message to the user like, Thanks you are already registered with us. I also need it to allow the user to still have access to the page. Sorry if this seems basic, but I have spent quite a while researching this and I believe it would be putting additional code in the authentication part, but I havent been able to figure it out.

Unfortunately, GCC cant do the same. When I try to call codetypeidcode without RTTI, my program crashes. I know disabling RTTI is not part of the standard, but is there anyway I can force GCC to do compile time resolution of known typesp  pRTTI is disabled for performance reasons. I have no need for runtime RTTI.p  pEditp  pHeres what I ended up going withp  precodetemplatelttypename Tgt const char TypeNamevoid templatelttypename Tgt const char TypeNameT type  return TypeNameltTgt   define REFLECTIONREGISTERTYPEtype      template ltgt const char TypeNamelttypegtvoid  return type   codepre  pIt requires that codeREFLECTIONREGISTERTYPEcode be called for every type that needs reflection info. But as long as its called for every required type, calling codeTypeNameltintgtcode works perfectly. I also added the function codeTypeNameT typecode which means you can do things like this codeint x  0 printfTypeNamexcode and it will print out int. GCC should really be able to do this at compile time like VC can. p

Negative 1695 pIs it possible to add more than one vsmdi file file that contains test metadata to a solution.p  pIm using one sln with all my testprojects in them. One vsmdi file was created and it is a solution item, thus on sln level. Each vsmdi file refers to a testsettings file.p  pNow my goal is to have multiple vsmdi files, each with their own testsettings files.  Now adding a testsettings file is no problem sln  Add  New Item...  Test Settings. But I cant find how to add a extra vsmdi file. Now I always need to change the testsettings reference inside the one vsmdi file.p  pThe purpose of all of this... Im executing vsmdi files using MsTest.exe on the console line which fits into my overall system test environment. I use remote execution with test controller and test agents. This remote execution setting is inside the testsettings file. I want to execute different group of tests, each on a specific group of test agents. The test agents filter can be specified in the testsettings file using roles and attributes. If I would have multiple vsmdi files this would solve my issue. Ok, I can always use multiple solutions but this rather cumbersome and not my prefered solution.p  pIm using VS2010 Premium, SP1 amp FP1.p

Negative 1695 pI have a very annoying problem with the languagelocale for our site. Ive been looking around here but havent found anything similar. p  pSo we support a few different languages and have everything set up with .po and .mo files which works fine most of the time.

Theres not really a pattern to it either, sometimes 6 en in a row and then sv and sometimes every second sv and en. p  pstrongEx.strong If you want to edit a user you get a popup which starts by including authorize.php where we check the language and set it accordingly with this functionp  precodefunction setlocale lang     switchlang          case sv  locale  svSE break         case en  locale  enSG break         case nl  locale  nlNL break         case dk  locale  daDK break         case vi  locale  viVN break         case zh  locale  zhCN break         default    locale  enSG break              putenvLANGUAGElocale     setlocaleLCALL, locale.UTF8     bindtextdomainmessages, .locale     textdomainmessages codepre  pI was running an account with Swedish, sv set and refreshed the edit user popup 10 times and debugged this function, lang was sv and  I logged setlocaleLCALL, 0 which returned svSE.UTF8 every time but the page was displayed in English 56 times. p  pIt seems like its only switching from the current language to English which is the original language, so I figure that its not getting translated. It doesnt look like were setting the wrongdefault language, it just ignoresdont have time to set the language. p  pThe language is not saved in cookies and some accounts just have 1 language which is not English and still gets this. p  pIn the above ex. when we return from authorize.php we dont use any language variable in the actual edit user page. So it shouldnt be able to change it there.

Keep in my mind, I have access to the user object from request.user since this view is behind a loginrequired decorator...p  p3 Is there perhaps a better way to achieve what I am trying to achieve that isnt as complicated and more DjangoPythonicp

I have confirmed that the database and code are exactly the same in both places.

I get the same behavior in all browsers using utf8 encoding.  I can look at the raw response and see the issue.p

Negative 1695 pIm building a masterdetail application in which the detail view may consist of nearly 100 fields.  The model object uses an external library to access the meta data in a file and does not need 100 properties the data is retrieved from the file and represented by a structure.  The fields are identified by an enumeration and accessed using a FindEnum method or by using an iterator, provided by the lib, which iterates over all the fields present in the meta data.p  pId like to take advantage of the EnumFinditerator in the library and not have to use 100 properties with getterssetters and 100 outlets to the text fields and other controls in the UI.p  pSimilar to an approach Ive seen in a program using this library, Id like to have one getter and one setter with a switch based on the meta datas enumerated FieldId.  Within the getter and setter Id like to programmatically access the appropriate text field or other control in the UI to get or set the value as needed.p  pWhen the user selects a file in the master view, the getter would iterate over all the detail fields and display the values of the associated meta data field.  When the user saves a file Id need to iterate over the changed fields and call the setter with the appropriate FieldId enum.p  pIm new to CocoaObjC and all I can think of is bindings  but can I bind fields to methods  Can I use the binding to pass the appropriate meta data FieldId to the gettersetterp  pWould having 100 outlets actually be appropriate in this situation  Should I be considering an alternate program architecture where the fieldsoutlets are logically grouped and divided among several classesp

Negative 1695 pI have designed a program which, basically, cuts a geometrical shape into many small triangles in a left canvas, applies some simple mathematical transformation to the bunch of triangles, and redraws them in their new configuration. See screen capture below.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comN1HED.png altscreen cap 1p  pIn order to draw these triangles, I use codeQPainterdrawPolygoncode. Each triangle on the right corresponds to a triangle on the left, so I know what color I want to use to draw it.p  pSo far, fine. Even if I draw many more triangles than this when I use much smaller triangles to cut the shape, this is fast enough.p  pIve added a feature to my program I can draw triangles extracted from a picture instead of plain triangles see following screen capture.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeyuUO.png altenter image description herep  pThe problem is that the way I do this is too slow. Heres how I do itp  ol liI run through all the trianglesli liFor each triangle, I compute the coordinates of each pixel that will be displayed.li liFor each one of these pixels, I compute the coordinates of the corresponding pixel on the picture this is an easy mathematical operation, and I retrieve that pixels color.li liI use codeQPaintersetPenQColorcode and codeQPainterdrawPointQPointcode to draw the pixel.li ol  pI am new to programming in Qt and I know nothing about graphics, so this is what I could come up with. The problem is that its unacceptably too slow the codepaintEventcode of each canvas takes about 0.15s, compared to 0.01s in the case of plain triangles.p  pI ran a profiler to try to understand whats going on, I noticed that in the canvas widgets codepaintEventcode,p  ol li58 of the time is spent in codeQPainterdrawPointcodeli li27 of the time is spent in codeQPaintersetPencodeli ol  pIt seems that codeQPainterdrawPointcode is far too complicated and slow I just want it to print a pixel of a given color, thats it.p  pI may have found a solution to my problem store a codeQImagecode as a member variable of my canvas widget that represents the whole thing I want my canvas to display, and define it entirely in my codepaintEventcode pixel by pixel, and then draw it at once at the end of my codepaintEventcode with codeQPainterdrawImagecode. I have a hint that this will be much faster. But before I rewrite my code all over again, Id like to know whether thats really what I want to do.p  pI hope I didnt bore you to do death Many thanks in advance for your insights.p

Negative 1695 pOK.Here is the situation.I think it is strange.I can not figure out what is wrong.p  pI create a static library project.And in that project I create a bundle named Common to put the image resources.p  pAnd I have 2 app project. One for ipad and the other one is for iphone.And in both app project I drag the bundle to it.So the both app project can use the image resource from the bundle Common.p  pFor example, I put a png named clock.png in the bundle Common.In the ipad app project I create a login.xib,and in the xib there is a UIImageView which I select the clock.png as its image.The clock.png can be seen in the xib.I do the same thing in the iphone app project.p  pthe strange thing is when I run the ipad app.The clock.png image can be load and shown on the screen.But when it comes to the iphone app, it says Could not load the clock.png image referenced from a nib in the bundle with identifier xx .p  pI am very confused about this.As I see, there no much difference between the two app project.Is there any settings that I should addp

However, realistically, the behavior in situations like this read only situations as it were can easily be emulated by an object a functorp  precodegtgtgt class MyAdderobject ...  def initself,y ...   self.y  y ...  def callself,x ...   return self.y  x ...  gtgtgt f  MyAdder5 gtgtgt f10 15 codepre  pThe object doesnt take up substantially more space to code, and it is far more versatile. Its also much easier to track and debug subsequent code. p  pIn this case, we only read from the nonlocal variable. But we can also write to it in Ruby, naturally, in Python by using the nonlocal keyword. The object supports that as well of course. But with the object, you have the data bundled together so you know exactly whats going on. The closure can potentially be carrying around variables in a totally nontransparent way and this can lead to code thats amazingly hard to debug. Heres a really bizarre examplep  precodeirbmain0010gt def newcounter irbmain0021gt x  0 irbmain0031gt lambda  x 1  irbmain0041gt end gt nil irbmain0050gt countera  newcounter gt ltProc0x00007f85c6421cd0irb3gt irbmain0060gt countera.call gt 1 irbmain0070gt countera.call gt 2 codepre  pAt least to me, this behavior is unintuitive. It also has the potential to cause memory leaks. This gives you a huge amount of rope to hang yourself with. Again, this is especially true in Ruby where you do not need to enable this explicitly unlike Python, and because in Ruby one has blocks all over their main code, which have access to everything. If an outside variable gets changed as a result of being in a closure, if you pass that closure around you can have a variable changed indefinitely far and out of scope from the place where it lives. Contrast to an object that always safely carries its data with it. p  pWhy do you hear a lot of talk about how good closures are, and how they should be potentially included in Java, how it sucked when they werent fully in Python, etc.  Why not use a functor Or refactor the code to avoid, given how incredibly dangerous they can be Just to clarify, Im not one of those foaming at the mouth OO types. Have I underestimated their use, overstated their danger, or bothp  pEdit maybe I should distinguish between three things closures that only read once which is what my example shows, and almost everyone discusses, closures that read in general, and closures that write. If you define a function inside another function using a variable local to the outer function, theres almost no chance this will come back to haunt you. The variable in that space is not accessible in any way I can think of, so you cant change it. This is pretty safe, and a convenient possibly more than functors way to generate functions. On the other hand, if you create a closure inside a class method or inside the main thread, it will read in variables each time that are called that can be accessed from other places. So it can change. I think this is dangerous because the closed over variable does not appear in the function header. You could have say a long closure on page 1 of your code that closes over a main thread variable x, and then modify x for unrelated reasons. Then reuse the closure and get bizarre behavior you dont understand, which may be hard to debug. If you actually write to enclosed variables, then as my example with Ruby shows you really have the potential to make a mess and cause unexpected behavior.p  pEdit2 I gave an example of bizarre behavior from closures for the third usage, writing to non local variables. Heres an example of bizarre not as bad behavior from the second usage defining closures in scopes where their closedover variables can be modifiedp  precodegtgtgt fs  [lambda n i  n for i in range10] gtgtgt fs[4]5 14 codepre

Negative 1695 pIm building a photography portfolio. I have two adjacent div columns floated left, each containing a long list of images sized to 100 of the width of the columns. This makes for a nice verticallyoriented grid of photos. However, the left column needs to load entirely before the right column starts to load, which can take a good deal of time. Id like for the two columns to load simultaneously from the tops, so that both of the images at the tops of the columns are visible first as the user loads the page.p  pMy stab at correcting this involves jQuery Lazyload. However, it doesnt seem to want to work properly. Rather than loading images as you scroll the page, it is loading the entire left column at once, and then loading the entire right column. Id like to fix this so that it loads the first few images at the tops of each column first, and then loads the other images as you scroll.p  pThanks in advancep  pstrongJavascriptstrongp  precodedocument.readyfunction       .leftcol img.lazyload         failurelimit  4,          effect  fadeIn,         threshold  10          .rightcol img.lazyload          failurelimit  4,          effect  fadeIn,         threshold  10          window.triggerscroll  codepre  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodeltdiv classleftcol colgt  ltdiv classitemgt    lta hreffilename.jpggt     ltimg datasrcjsholderholder.js200x300 dataoriginalfilename.jpg alt gt    ltagt  ltdivgt  ltdiv classitemgt    lta hreffilename.jpggt     ltimg datasrcjsholderholder.js200x300 dataoriginalfilename.jpg alt gt    ltagt  ltdivgt ltdivgt  ltdiv classrightcol colgt  ltdiv classitemgt    lta hreffilename.jpggt     ltimg datasrcjsholderholder.js200x300 dataoriginalfilename.jpg alt gt    ltagt  ltdivgt  ltdiv classitemgt    lta hreffilename.jpggt     ltimg datasrcjsholderholder.js200x300 dataoriginalfilename.jpg alt gt    ltagt  ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pstrongCSSstrongp  precode.item     width100      float left     marginbottom8px     clearboth  .item img     width100  .col     maxwidth650px     width45     floatleft     marginright12px  codepre

Negative 1695 pEDIT Fixed, unconventially I think, all I did was marginleft auto marginright auto, the nav menu, and gave it a fixed width of my liking 1002px, in my case, and made the positioning relative, and created another div which had a mock background, and made it absolute.

Negative 1695 pAs per my understanding, codeNSNullcode exists as a replacement of codenilcode in situations where an object is explicitly required, such in codeNSArraycode and codeNSDictionarycode collections.p  pOne of the good parts of codenilcodes behavior is that many verbose codenullcode checks can be skipped and it would convenient to have the same behavior implemented by codeNSNullcode.

The first one Client1p  precodeDatagramSocket socket  null DatagramPacket packet  null  try       byte[] data test.getBytes      packet  new DatagramPacketdata, data.length, InetAddress.getByName192.168.0.26, 325      socket  new DatagramSocket      socket.sendpacket    catch Exception ex        ...   codepre  pAnd the second one Client2p  precodeDatagramSocket socket  null DatagramPacket packet  null  try       byte[] data test.getBytes      packet  new DatagramPacketdata, data.length      socket  new DatagramSocket325, InetAddress.getByName192.168.0.26      socket.sendpacket    catch Exception ex        ...   codepre  pThese two options came when I was making tests sending data to and from my own PC. My IP address is 192.168.0.26. With the first one I had no problems, but the second one throws two kinds of exceptions. I can verify that Client1 works running the next code in the computer at the same timep  pServerp  precodebyte data[]  null try      data new byte[1000]     socket  new DatagramSocket325     packet  new DatagramPacketdatos, datos.length     socket.receivepacket     System.out.printlndatos  catch Exception ex      ...  codepre  pIf I run Server first and then the Client1 option, it actually recieves the data. When I run the Client1 first and then the Server, obviously dont get any data but neither get any exceptions. The real problem and actual question, sorry about so many, perhaps useless, info is with Client2. If this is ran before Server, I get NullPointerExceptionp  precodejava.lang.NullPointerException null address  null buffer at java.net.DualStackPlainDatagramSocketImpl.sendDualStackPlainDatagramSocketImpl.java115 at java.net.DatagramSocket.sendDatagramSocket.java676 codepre  pgenerated when method send is invoked. I know maybe I should ignore this even thought Im a little bit newbie with Sockets, it seems wrong to send data if you know nobody will recieve it. In the other hand, when Server runs first and then Client2, I get BindExceptionp  precodejava.net.BindException Address already in use Cannot bind at java.net.DualStackPlainDatagramSocketImpl.socketBindNative Method at java.net.DualStackPlainDatagramSocketImpl.bind0DualStackPlainDatagramSocketImpl.java65 at java.net.AbstractPlainDatagramSocketImpl.bindAbstractPlainDatagramSocketImpl.java95 at java.net.DatagramSocket.bindDatagramSocket.java376 at java.net.DatagramSocket.ltinitgtDatagramSocket.java231 at java.net.DatagramSocket.ltinitgtDatagramSocket.java284 codepre  pfrom the line when the socket is initialized. Due to that Client1 works, Ill use it but Id really like to know why does it work but Client2 doesnt. I read in another forum here about that BindException, and I understood it was caused when you attempt to use one port which is already in use, but in this sense Client1 should fail too. Could someone explain me the difference between Client1 and Client2p

Negative 1695 pFolks, I am just learning about constructors. I am wondering why MS is allowing both private as well as public constructor in a class. If I have both private and private constructor, it apparently fails the purpose of private constructor as in, it allows the creation of instance of the class outside. I find it strange. What I would expect is, if both private and public constructors are present in a class, it should be a compile time error.p  pCan someone please explain the usage with example and the reason.p

Negative 1695 pI recently switched from SubCut to Scaldi and theres a feature I find undocumentedmissingp  pIn SubCut, when you define a binding, you can a hrefhttpsgithub.comdickwallsubcutblobmasterGettingStarted.mdsettingupaconfigurationmodule relnofollowchoose between different binding modesa  codetoSinglecode, codetoProvidercode, codeto moduleInstanceOfcode, codetoModuleSinglecode, which decide if the injected instances will be created once, or each time the bind is performed.

Negative 1695 pI have a storyboard in which I have a view controller, InfoViewController in which I have an UIScrollView with some labels, uitextviews, etc. this is all created in IB, no code has been written at all. The only thing that is left for me to do is to set the content size, which I do as followingp  precodevoidviewDidAppearBOOLanimated [super viewDidAppearanimated] CGRect screenRect  [[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds] [self.scrollView setContentSizeCGSizeMakescreenRect.size.width, 600] [self.scrollView setBackgroundColor[UIColor greenColor]]  codepre  pWhenever I make this view the entry point of my app, it works perfectly. I can see my view, the content size is set, the background color is being set to green.p  pNow it comes, I created another view controller, and this view controller is now my entry point of the app. I added a button in there, and on this button I did a modal segue to the earlier mentioned Info View Controller.p  pWhen I now run my app, I press this button, my Info View Controller shows up. The green background color is being set, but its impossible to scroll. So the code is being executed otherwise the background color couldnt been green, in the storyboard its just plain white but somehow whenever I use this modal segue, the scroll functionality gets lost.p  pHow can I fix thisp

Negative 1695 pI recently upgraded to pandas version 0.13 and am experiencing this problem where no matter how big my dataframe is  the biggest one has 25 columns and 158430 rows, pandas prints out the entire dataframe well not the entire thing, just a few rows in each column but its still messy instead of printing out the summary table which is much cleaner in the case of such large data frames.

Negative 1695 pstrongjsFiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netaz6Ug relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netaz6Ugastrongp  pUsing Snap.svg library, I want drag on the SVG and get the mouse position. I need the mouse position on the internal matrix, not the browser mouse position. I have this working with one problem, which is if there is any scroll on the window that the SVG belongs to, the calculated mouse position is offset by the amount of scroll on the scrollbar.p  pFor example, with no scroll then it works fine. Or with 10px of vertical scroll on the scrollbar, the mouse position is calculated as true position  10px. Its the same deal if theres any horizontal scroll offset by the amount of scroll.p  pIn the jsFiddle, I use a rectangle to show the calculared mouse position while dragging. As you can see if theres no scroll, then the rectangle stays with the mouse cursor upper left corner. But with some scroll, the rectangle is offset from the mouse cursor.p  pAlthough Im using the Snap.svg library, I only use this to get the drag event, the mouse calculation is pure Javascript. A possible solution is to subtract the X and Y by the amount of scroll but I think there will be a better way using the SVGs tranform functions.p  precodevar S var pt var svg var box  window.onload  function     svg  mysvg[0]     S  Snapsvg      pt  pt  svg.createSVGPoint  create the point       add the rectangle     box  S.rect10, 10, 50, 50     box.attr fill  red, stroke  none       S.drag         functiondx, dy, posX, posY, e             onmove             pt.x  posX             pt.y  posY               convert the mouse X and Y so that its relative to the svg element             var transformed  pt.matrixTransformsvg.getScreenCTM.inverse             box.attr x  transformed.x, y  transformed.y          ,         function             onstart         ,         function             onend                 codepre

Negative 1695 pIf two scripts embedded in a web page need to communicate, one needs some kind of global state, most often a global variable. So while minimizing the amount of global state is always a good idea, one rarely gets along with no global variable.p  pIt is easy to choose a variable name that doesnt clash with what is already standardized, say I choose codefoocode or codeFoocode. But what about future compatibility What happens if a new Web API or a new Ecmascript version introduces a codefoocode function or a codeFoocode object When a third script is on the page that needs the new standard codeFoocode object, it will crash because my scripts have overwritten it with something completely different.p  pBut even if no thirdparty scripts are on the page, my scripts might run into trouble. Say I have named a global variable codeonfoocode and later browser environments introduce a new event codefoocode on the global window object. Whenever that new event is fired, my global object codeonfoocode will be called...p  pThus my question is whether there is any notion of reserved global identifiers in browser environment or whether some names are considered safe. So how should I name my global module The same goes with other namespaces like custom event names. p

Negative 1695 pI am looking for a way to sum the color values of all pixels of an image. I require this to estimate the total flux of a bright source say a distant galaxy from its surface brightness image.  Would anyone please help me how can I sum the colour values of all pixels of an image. p  pFor example Each pixel of the following image has a colour value in between 0 to 1. But when I read the image with imread the colour values of each pixel I get is an array of 3 elements. I am very new in matplotlib and I do not know how can I convert that array to single values in the scale of 0 to 1 and add them.  p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comiyyEv.png altenter image description herep
Negative 1695 pSo, this is going to sound like an odd question, but strongI need to know how to get the codeClasscode object of a child codeObjectcode in an inheritance situation for Java reflectionstrong.p  pThe situation is this Im writing CraftBukkit plugins, Java plugins that work with CraftBukkit, a serversideonly plugin A.P.I. for Minecraft. At the moment, Im making a plugin that is supposed to be like a parent to all of the other plugins Im writing. It contains large amounts of extra useful Objects and utilities.p  pOne class in the plugin is an Object class called codemyPlugincode that I want all the main classes of all the other plugins to codeextendcode. I know Object names shouldnt start with a lowercase letter, but the lowercase my is a trademark with my CraftBukkit plugins.p  pOne of the things that I want this codemyPlugincode class to do is be able to handle commands to load plugins data. Therefore, when the command is called, strongI want the plugin to basically call all of the methods in the plugins main class that start with loadstrong.p  pI know how to search through all the Methods in the codeClasscode for ones starting with load if I can just retrieve the codeClasscode, but strongif I try to call codegetClasscode in the codemyPlugincode class, I believe its just going to return the codemyPlugincode codeClasscode instead of the codeClasscode that extends codemyPlugincodestrong.p  pSo, stronghow can I retrieve the codeClasscode that extends codemyPlugincode instead of the codemyPlugincode class itselfstrongp  pEDIT I feel that I should mention that Ive considered creating an codeabstractcode method called codemainClasscode that will return the Class and making each plugin add this method and return their main class, but this is an ugly fix that I would prefer to avoid.p

Negative 1695 pcurrently I am working on an application that will allow the user to loginregister and then post a commentview comments. I am testing the data on a local host using XAMPP and Myphpadmin. I know the php side of things work as I have created mock interfaces and ran them via the web browser. They all interact with the database fine and display results when requested. The application so far will allow the user to sign in or register. These are registered to the database and work fine. The user can add a message to the database once signed in this is semi working as it is adding the message to the database but then this should display all messages in a listview.

Thus, I have written the app such a way that whenever an exception occurs, it logs the exception stack trace, performs some diagnostics, then logs the diagnostics information and continues with next syncing attempts. p  pFor uncaught exceptions I added Exception handlers for codeApplication.ThreadExceptioncode and also for codeAppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledExceptioncode in my codeMaincode threadp  precodestatic void Mainstring[] args          Application.ThreadException  new ThreadExceptionEventHandlerUIThreadExceptionHandler     Application.SetUnhandledExceptionModeUnhandledExceptionMode.CatchException     AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException  new UnhandledExceptionEventHandlerUnhandledExceptionHandler       Application.EnableVisualStyles     Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefaultfalse     Application.Runnew myForm    exception handlers  public static void UIThreadExceptionHandlerobject sender, ThreadExceptionEventArgs t        logger.FatalFatal Windows Forms Error      logStackTracet.Exception                    logs the stack trace with some desired formatting        Application.Exitnew CancelEventArgstrue     public static void UnhandledExceptionHandlerobject sender, UnhandledExceptionEventArgs t         logger.FatalFatal Application Error      logStackTraceExceptiont.ExceptionObject logs the stack trace with some desired formatting                 Application.Exitnew CancelEventArgstrue   codepre  pI kept my app running for testing and realized that whenever codeApplication.ThreadExceptioncode is caught, the app correctly logs the string codeFatal Windows Forms Errorcode, followed by the exception stack trace and then the application exits. p  pI dont want the app to exit. I just want that it should log the exception stack trace and continue with next syncing attempt. The exception that is occurring in UI thread is not that severe one, since the same exception also occurred in the othernonUI threads of the app, but it did not crashed the app as I can see this in logs. However when the same exception occurs in the UI thread, the app crashes.p

Negative 1695 pI have a continuous rotation servo that I need to go clockwise and counterclockwise.

Negative 1695 pI have a home machine and office machine I use to publish websites using Visual Studio 2013. If I make a change from the same machine, and republish, just the changes are published, not all files.p  pHowever, when using my clone machine at the office, even if I do a get latest, make one small change, and republish, all files are published, not just the ones that changed, and not just the ones that have been recompiled. ALL dll files, even third party dlls that have not changed or have been recompiled with a new date, are republished. Same thing happens if my cohort publishes a small change on his machine after I did the last publish. Not a problem if publishing twice from the same machine as then only the changed files are published.p  pIs there anyway to prevent complete republishing just because a different machine is used to publish than the one used for the last publish Thanks.p

Negative 1695 pIve been having this problem for quite a while. I am developing a drawing app with the options of blurring the lines drawn.

Negative 1695 pSo, I have my SQLite DataBase setup, but now I want to know how can I make data update if a certain name already exist. For example, my app has the user input the name of a chore or errand. Then I have the user input information about this chore or errand such as priority, and time needed to complete the task. And when the user clicks a create activity button, my code creates a button with the name of the chore as its text. And I have my app setup where the user can click on this chore button, and it will show the information that was entered in for this specific chore. It leads the user to another activity in which the user can change the information about the choresuch as priority and time needed, but it doesnt allow them to change the name of the chore. And so, when the user clicks on a button saying update, I want my data base to identify the chore by its name, and replace every other variable.

Negative 1695 pI already have a working fixed footer in my webpage in iOS, but I want to repair it so it will not zoom with the rest of the content. Currently, it appears fine at normal zoom level, but when the user zooms in, the footer gets too big and runs off the page see screenshot images linked below. I have  achieved the desired behavior in the header such that it does not zoom with the rest of the page. I am currently using div tags, not the actual footer tag but I have tried it both ways and the problem persists. I am including relevant CSS code below the image links. I have tried using codewidth100code instead of codemaxwidth380pxcode with no luck. To view the full HTMLCSS source, please use your browsers view source function at a hrefhttpwww.michigandayspas.comindex.php relnofollowhttpwww.michigandayspas.comindex.phpa. The footer divs are very close to the bottom and the div classes are footercont and footer.p  pI have wrapped the header and footer content in similar divs so I am confused as to why they are not behaving similarly. One difference is that the header has an IMG tag, but the footer div contains more complicated HTML elements such as a table, but I dont see how this can cause an issue. I got and modified the code from a helpful video tutorial at a hrefhttpwww.cssreset.comcreatingfixedheaderswithcss relnofollowhttpwww.cssreset.comcreatingfixedheaderswithcssap  pNOTE I have two stylesheets one for the desktop or tablet and another designed for mobile phones, especially iPhones.

Image is inputed into html as codeltIMGgtcode NOT as css background property. The codeltIMGgtcode has its wrapper codeDIVcode and codeltIMGgtcode is se to height200. I am expecting the codeIMGcode to scale so that I can see only top 50 and the width of the codeDIVcode to be determined by the width of codeIMGcode, which is same as the visible height 50 of total height  since the image is 200x400px... there you go... a SQUARE .p  pPracticep  pIt works until I resize window. Height of the iconwrapping codeDIVcode is 10 of window height, so if I resize window, codeDIVcode height goes as well, and so does the codeIMGcode inside. BUT the codeDIVscode width stays the same as before resizing and so my icons get clipped . If I then change any css prop via FF DOM Inspector, hover event..., the codeDIVcode updates to correct width.p  pDoes anyone have any idea, what could be causing itp  pThank you very very much p  pPS No need for you to send me JS solution.

After these routes are followed a certain number of times, Safari on iOS 7 just stops following them  its like they get half clicked  the link gets underlined, but it is never followed, and subsequently no amount of clicking on it will allow it to be followed.p  pHere is a very simple dart application that will replicate the issuep  pIn the root folderp  ppubspec.yamlp  precodename DartRouteChecker description A sample web application dependencies   angular 0.14.0   browser any transformers  angular codepre  pThen in the web folderp  pdartroutechecker.dartp  precodelibrary dartroutechecker  import packageangularangular.dart import packageangularapplicationfactory.dart  class MyAppModule extends Module    MyAppModule      bindNgRoutingUsePushState, toValue new NgRoutingUsePushState.valuefalse     bindRouteInitializerFn, toImplementation Routes      void main    applicationFactory     .addModulenew MyAppModule     .run   Injectable class Routes     void callRouter router, RouteViewFactory views      views.configure       route1 ngRoutepath route1, defaultRoute true, view route1.html,       route2 ngRoutepath route2id, view route2.html          codepre  pdartroutechecker.htmlp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt  lthtmlgt   ltheadgt     ltmeta charsetutf8gt     ltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth, initialscale1gt     lttitlegtDartRouteCheckerlttitlegt      ltscript async typeapplicationdart srcdartroutechecker.dartgtltscriptgt     ltscript async srcpackagesbrowserdart.jsgtltscriptgt      ltlink relstylesheet hrefdartroutechecker.cssgt   ltheadgt   ltbodygt     ltngviewgtltngviewgt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pdartroutechecker.cssp  precodebody    backgroundcolor F8F8F8   fontfamily Open Sans, sansserif   fontsize 14px   fontweight normal   lineheight 1.2em   margin 15px   h1, p    color 333   samplecontainerid    width 100   height 400px   position relative   border 1px solid ccc   backgroundcolor fff   sampletextid    fontsize 24pt   textalign center   margintop 140px   webkituserselect none   userselect none  codepre  proute1.htmlp  precodelth1gtROUTE 1lth1gt ltdivgt lta hrefroute21gtGo to second routeltagt ltdivgt codepre  proute2.htmlp  precodelth1gtROUTE 2lth1gt ltdivgt lta hrefroute1gtGo to first routeltagt ltdivgt codepre  pUse pub build to build the app generate javascript, then navigate to it using an iPhone with iOS 7 I tested it on an iPhone 5 and an iPhone 4S both with iOS 7.1.2.  Click on Go to second route then Go to first route over and over again until you get to around 30 clicks  the link will then stop responding...  Its almost always exactly 30 clicks that will cause it though I have once or twice seen it be around 43, though I cant be sure I didnt click something else during those times  Ive done so much stinkin clickin in the last week that I feel Im going slightly insane...p  pI cant replicate this issue when the iPhone is plugged in to a mac to debug it.  It also doesnt happen if neither of the routes contains a parameter.  And it happens with FEWER clicks if there are more routes defined in the route initialisation class, or if the routes contain multiple parameters.  Initially I thought that the problem might have been that one of our routes had an ampersand in it, but that didnt turn out to be the case.  And it doesnt happen at all in any other browsers, including Chrome on iOS.p  pI suspect this might be a bug in Safari possibly related to Safari not handling hashchanges correctly, and not handling browser history correctly when using appcache which, BTW, I am not using here, but this is a real showstopper for us here  many of our customers are using iPhones, so if our app keeps freezing on the standard browser on an iPhone, were in a lot of strife.  p  pHas anyone seen anything like this before  Anyone have any suggestions for a workaround  Or a new career.....p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pWe have tracked the issue down to the route method in route.dartp  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comangularroute.dartblobmasterlibclient.dartL480 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comangularroute.dartblobmasterlibclient.dartL480ap  pIn the method gotoUrl a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularroute.dartblobmasterlibclient.dartL782 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comangularroute.dartblobmasterlibclient.dartL782a, if we change it from coderouteurl.thensuccess code to codenew Future.valuetrue.thensuccess code then the issue no longer occurs  of course then we lose all the preenter etc etc functionality that routing provides.  But it seems that somewhere in that route function, something is going awry...p

Negative 1695 pI am trying to parse some PDF documents 1.7 format to extract numeric data. p  pI am using the python PDF miner package and it works well.p  pFor most of the document, a row in a table will be converted to a single text string.

Negative 1695 pIm using Windows 7 and have recently switched from Eclipse to Android Studio. I am now having trouble debugging.p  pRunning Android Studio 0.8.6, I set up a completely default install, I create a default empty project, targeting the ICS SDK, using the new project wizard. I then put a breakpoint in onCreate, click on the debug button and run.p  pThe debugger attached as I can see the message Connected to the target VM in the debugger window.p  pI know the code is being executed because I am updating some text in the UI to show this.p  pI have tried putting breakpoints in many places but none are hit.p  pIm pulling my hair out here as I just cannot see what I am doing wrong. Im new to gradle so I think there may be some settings in gradle that I should be changing, but surely an absolutely standard project built with the wizard should let me hit breakpointsp  pOne thing I noticed is that in my build.gradle file there is no mention of a debug build, only a release. I wondered if that might be the problemp  precodebuildTypes      release          runProguard false         proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFileproguardandroid.txt, proguardrules.pro       codepre  pNote. I have tried this on both my own device and the emulatorp  pUPDATEp  pI changed the settings in the View Breakpoints options to turn on Java Exception Breakpoints but only for uncaught exceptions. Then, at the end of onCreate I deliberately cause a NullPointerException. When I run in debug now, I still dont hit my actual code and dont see the code break on my source, but the program does pause. I know it is my NullPointerException that is causing this because when I remove it, I can see that the code continues and does not break.p  pAt the point that my code breaks the debug window shows that I am in the main thread, in a function called performLaunchActivity. I cannot see any more information than this. Presumably therefore I am debugging through whatever level of code is calling performLaunchActivity but that my source is being treated as if I cant step through itp

Negative 1695 pIve taken over a large and very old project recently.  It compiles without problems but since the code is so old and the former developers werent always doing things the way they were supposed to, I get a lot of warnings with a modern compiler.p  pNow I change parts of the code and sometimes introduce an error.  When I recompile the project, a lot of warning output is happening, and at the end of the output, I see a message like thisp  precodeSomeFile.C342651 warning deprecated conversion from string constant to char [Wwritestrings]          SomeCodeSome String                                 SomeFile.C342955 warning deprecated conversion from string constant to char [Wwritestrings]          SomeCodeSome Other String                                       make[2]  [SomeFile.o] Error 1 make[2] Leaving directory somepathofasourcedirectorysomesubdirectory make[1]  [somesubdirectory] Error 2 make[1] Leaving directory somepathofasourcedirectory make  [directory] Error 2  BUILD FAILED exit value 2, total time 2s codepre  pAnd a lot of warnings above that I just showed two of a list of dozens.p  pThe real error is displayed hundreds of lines above that and readsp  precodeSomeFile.C In function void someFunction SomeFile.C8915 error someIdentifier was not declared in this scope      someIdentifiergtsomeMoreStuffgtsomeMethodsomeArgs       codepre  pMy problem now is to find the error message.  It would be easy if I could strongturn off the warningsstrong because then the error message would be the last thing printed.p  pstrongSo is there a way to tell the compiler not to give out any warnings or at least print the error messages at the very endstrong that would be enough to solve my problemp  pI want to solve this issue with as little patch work as possible, so it is more or less out of the question to fix all code occurrences issuing the warnings, especially since I am about to throw away large parts of it in the end and just keep one feature I want to extract.p  pI can, however, change all files maybe inserting a codepragmacode or codedefinecode or similar at the beginning using codefindcode and codesedcode, I also can patch the codeMakefilecodes in all directories.  It would be nice, however, to be able to switch the solution off and on without having to patch too much if possible, I dont want to demand too much.p  pI found and tried some information on suppressing warnings, e. g. a hrefhttpdbpconsulting.comtutorialsSuppressingGCCWarnings.html relnofollowthis herea, but using options codeicode or codeisystemcode or codepragma GCC systemheadercode seems not to work in my case, probably because the file being warned about is the one given on the command line, not an included file.  The codepragmacode is being warned about itself because of this.p

Negative 1695 pI have a maven module that builds a war file and then packages it as an RPM. This works fine. p  pThis war file also relies on the fact that another war file exists on the server. The authors of this war file are in another team and do not package their wars as RPMs.p  pI would like, as part of my module build process, to download this war file from the company repository, package it up as an RPM, and create some symlinks and dependencies, etc... I can download the war file to my target folder easily enough. I can build an appropriate RPM using the artifacts built from this module easily enough. What I can not do is, using the maven rpm plugin, create an RPM that includes the specific war file whilst also excluding the artifacts from my module. In fact, I cant find the right option to get the secondary war file into the RPM at all. Overlays wont help as the webapp needs to be visible on a certain URL.p  pIt seems that multiple executions still creates only one RPM. I wouldnt mind if both WAR files were in one RPM, so perhaps this is the best option  it would explain why I cant create an RPM without the module artifacts being included.p  pIve looked through the maven rpm plugin and whilst Im sure its there, I cant see the option Im looking for, and google searching the terms involved obviously gives an awful lot of hits...p  pI will supply sample code if its deemed absolutely necessary, but realistically Im hoping someone will just be able to give me the right options to go look up in the documentation  I feel its just a case of me not knowing the search terms I need.p  pMany thanks in advance for all your help.p  hr  pExample of a working pom that creates our rpm as expected, however without the addition of a war file that resides in targetother.app.name.warp  precode            ltplugingt             ltgroupIdgtcom.company.name.maven.pluginltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtredlinerpmmavenpluginltartifactIdgt             ltexecutionsgt                 ltexecutiongt                     ltidgtcreateapp.nameother.app.namewebapprpmltidgt                     ltphasegtpackageltphasegt                     ltgoalsgt                         ltgoalgtrpmartifactltgoalgt                     ltgoalsgt                     ltconfigurationgt                         ltnamegtwebappapp.nameother.app.nameltnamegt                         ltinstallLocationgtusrsharecompany.namewebappsltinstallLocationgt                         ltconfigInstallLocationgtetccompany.namewebappsltconfigInstallLocationgt                         ltsourceDirectorygtproject.build.directoryrpmltsourceDirectorygt                         ltincludeSourceDirectorygttrueltincludeSourceDirectorygt                         ltdependsgt                             ltdependgt                                 ltnamegtwebappapp.nameltnamegt                             ltdependgt                             ltdependgt                                 ltnamegtwebappother.app.nameltnamegt                             ltdependgt                         ltdependsgt                         ltsymlinksgt                             ltsymlinkgt                                 ltsourcegtusrsharecompany.namewebappsapp.nameother.app.name.warltsourcegt                                 lttargetgtapp.nameother.app.name.warlttargetgt                             ltsymlinkgt                             ltsymlinkgt                                 ltsourcegtusrlocaltomcatinstancesCOREwebappsapp.nameother.app.name.warltsourcegt                                 lttargetgtusrsharecompany.namewebappsapp.nameother.app.name.warlttargetgt                             ltsymlinkgt                             ltsymlinkgt                                 ltsourcegtusrlocaltomcatinstancesCOREwebappsapp.nameother.app.name.xmlltsourcegt                                 lttargetgtetccompany.namewebappsapp.nameother.app.name.xmllttargetgt                             ltsymlinkgt                         ltsymlinksgt                     ltconfigurationgt                 ltexecutiongt             ltexecutionsgt         ltplugingt codepre

Negative 1695 pThis question isnt as philosophical as the title might suggest. Consider the following approach to persistencep  pCommands to perform Operations come in from various Clients. I represent both Operations and Clients as persistent actors. The Clients state is the lastOperationId to pass through. The Operations state is pretty much an FSM of the Operations progress its effectively a Saga, as it then needs to reach out to other systems external to the ActorSystem in order to move through its states.p  pA Reception actor receives the operation command, which contains the client id and operation id. The Reception actor creates or retrieves the Client actor and forwards it the command. The Client actor reads and validates the operation command, persists it, creates an OperationReceived event, updates its own state with the this operation id. Now it needs to create a new Operation actor to manage the new longrunning operation. But here is where I get lost and all the nice examples in the documentation and on the various blogs dont help. Most commentators say that a PersistentActor converts commands to events, and then updates their state. They may also have side effects as long as they are not invoked during replay. So I have two areas of confusionp  ol liIs the creation of an Operation actor in this context equivalent to creating state, or performing a side effect It doesnt seem like a side effect, but at the same time its not changing its own state, but causing a state change in a new child.li liAm I supposed to construct a Command to send to the new Operation actor or will I simply forward it the OperationReceived event li ol  pIf I go with my assumption that creating a child actor is not a side effect, it means I must also create the child when replaying. This in turn would cause the state of the child to be recovered.p  pI hope the underlying question is clear. I feel its a general question, but the best way I can formulate it is by giving a specific example.p  pstrongEditstrong  On reflection, I think that the creation of one persistent actor from another is an act of creating state, albeit outsourced. That means that the event that triggers the creation will trigger that creation on a subsequent replay which will lead to the retrieval of the childs own persisted state. This makes me think that passing the event rather than a wrapping command might be the cleanest thing to do as the same event can be applied to update the state in both parent and child. There should be no need to persist the event as it comes into the child  it has already been persisted in the parent and will replay. p

Negative 1695 pAssume there is a worker service that receives messages from a queue, reads the product with the specified Id from a document database, applies some manipulation logic based on the message, and finally writes the updated product back to the database a.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRZYlA.png althorizontally scaling writesp  pThis work can be safely done in parallel when dealing with different products, so we can scale horizontally b. However, if more than one service instance works on the same product, we might end up with concurrency issues, or concurrency exceptions from the database, in which case we should apply some retry logic and still the retry might fail again and so on. p  pstrongQuestionstrong How do we avoid this Is there a way I can ensure two instances are not working on the same productp  pstrongExampleUse casestrong An online store has a great sale on productA, productB and productC that ends in an hour and hundreds of customers are buying.

Which means that I can draw a rounded rectangle but it wont be filled with the color I want.p  pHow do I do it And also, I read that due to some aliasing problems, the corners are often rendered equal. How do I set it as equal for all four Will codepainter.setRenderHintQPainterAntialiasingcode suffice Or do I have to do anything elsep

Negative 1695 pI am attempting to build a simple showhide directive based on elements transcluded into divs. I have a parent and a child directive. When the parent directive is clicked on, the child directive should toggle showhide its div. The toggle function sits in the parent controller and toggles the variable between true and false so that the child directive can showhide.p  pThe problem the toggle function in the parent directive works correctly, however the child directive is not aware of the toggle variable changing when the parent is clicked. I am passing the ctrl to the link function in the child directive by using require. This way I can access the parent controller objects for showing and hiding.

Negative 1695 pIm having trouble coordinating some hover effects. As of now, I have an image, title tag on top of it, and a playbutton that changes when hovered over. Eventually eventually clicking the image or playbutton will cause a Vimeo or Youtube video to appear in place of the image, but I think thats a jquery job and I havent gotten to it yet.p  pOnload, Id like there to be no playbutton. Just the image with title. Then as you hover over the image its opacity changes that, or a transparent image screens it, the title disappears, and the playbutton appears over the image and transparency. And when you pass over the playbutton it also changes as it does now, but the title is still gone, amp the transparency over image remains.p  pSo, on hovering over the image, simultaneously the title tag disappears, a transparent image screens the big image opacity change would also work, and playbutton  with its own hover effect  appears.p  pI tried coding all this and it just caused a mess.

I thought it could be a result of a difference in my environment variables so I compared the two dumping both environments with the codeenvcode command. There were some extra bash variables in my primary account so one by one Ive unset them until I reached two identical environments with the exceptions of home directory values, user names, autogenerated values for gnome session tokens and such. Despite those changes, the problem consists. Another wild guess of mine was that the code.meteorcode folder has gone evil on me. So, Ive removed it and reinstalled meteor. That didnt fix it either.

Negative 1695 pCurrently I have two ideas for passing data from one view to other in angulajs and using ui.router.p  ol liSet the data using local storage in one view and then retrieve that data on next view .This does not seem to be an efficient wayli liCreate a service and share the same object created using service with both the views.

Negative 1695 pThis question is related to the way that PCL Viewer displays PolygonMesh, when Using C and Windows. As you may know, the color of each face is calculated based on the mean of the color of three vertices constructed the triangle if it is square, so the color is calculated based on vertices of the square. But, In other 3D software such as MeshLab, CloudCompare, ..., if same mesh is opened, the color of each face not only is not a constant color, but also is a gradient which changes smoothly among the colors of the vertices.p  pNow I want to know that is there any possibility in PCL Viewer or OpenCV or VTK, to display the color smoothly like the one in MeshLabp  pBesides, I have also another question related to face color How can I change the color of a face, for a PolygonMesh object in PCL libraryp

However Im having a problem with an URL.Action that is added to a  datahref attribute, after the partial view has been return. p  pWhen the page loads for the first time this issue doesnt occur, its only after I have made an ajax request using the pagination results that url.action doesnt seem to bind correctly.p  pThis is the action that the URL.Action should link to note the Route Attributep  precode[RouteProjectcodeRequestnumber] public ActionResult Detailsstring code, int number      if number  0  code  null return new HttpStatusCodeResultHttpStatusCode.BadRequest      var viewModel  requestLogic.GetIrDetailsViewModelcode, number      if viewModel  null return HttpNotFound      return ViewviewModel  codepre  pOn the main view I add an Html.Action to this Actionp  precode[HttpGet] public PartialViewResult GetProjectRequestsstring code, int page  1, int pageSize  10      var viewModel  requestLogic.GetRequestsForProjectcode, page, pageSize     return PartialViewProjectRequestsList, viewModel  codepre  pThis Action is also used by the ajax call for the tables pagination, hence the page and pageSize arguments.p  pInside this partial view I render a table with the model data, adding the datahref attribute to each row like sop  precodeforeach var item in Model      lttr classclickablerow datahrefUrl.ActionDetails, new number  item.RequestNogt         lttdgt....  codepre  pThis will render the datahref attribute like sop  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOK16g.png altenter image description herep  pHowever after I make a successful ajax call and the html for the partial is replaced.

Negative 1695 pI have a problem in a Qt application when I attempt to plot my dataframe as an area plot with a time index using pandas plotting function in combination with Seaborns FacetGrids. What happens is that a grid layout is correctly created, but the plots do not appear in these grids. Using a Seaborn plotting function works as expected, though.p  pI tried to figure out whats going on by isolating the drawing routines from the rest of my code, and Ive found a rather unexpected behaviour as shown below using ipython notebookp  pp  pre classlangpy prettyprintoverridecodematplotlib inline  import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns  df  pd.DataFrame         Home [76, 64, 38, 78, 63,    45, 32, 46, 13, 40],         Away [55, 67, 70, 56, 59,    69, 72, 24, 45, 21],         Team [T1]  5             [T2]  5,         Year [1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995]  2 codepre  pp  pNow, what I want to do is to draw two facets, one for each team. Each facet should show the Away and Home columns as two separate time series. In line with the suggestion in another question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25702017plottingtimeseriesusingseabornfacetgrid titlePlotting time series using Seaborn FacetGridPlotting time series using Seaborn FacetGrida, I wrote a function that calls the pandas plotting function for the subset passed to it by mapdataframep  pp  pre classlangpy prettyprintoverridecodedef plotareadata, color     data[[Home, Away]].index  pd.todatetimedata[Year]     data[[Home, Away]].plotkindarea codepre  pp  pHowever, when using this function, the result is rather unexpected the FacetGrid is created and initialized correctly, but the two calls to the pandas method do not use this grid as their plotting region, and they appear elsewhere. p  pp  pre classlangpy prettyprintoverridecodeg  sns.FacetGriddf, colTeam g.mapdataframeplotarea codepre  pp  precodeltseaborn.axisgrid.FacetGrid at 0x1a25110gt codepre  pScreenshot of output p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZ6D6T.png altp  pIn the post I linked above, mwaskom notes that methods called in this way p  blockquote   pmust draw a plot on the currently active matplotlib Axes.p blockquote  pPerhaps that is the problem here The code as such appears to be correct, because with a different plotting function, everything works as expected, e.g. with a sns.heatmapp  pp  pre classlangpy prettyprintoverridecodedef plotheatmapdata, color     sns.heatmapdata[[Home, Away]]      g  sns.FacetGriddf, colTeam g.mapdataframeplotheatmap codepre  pp  precodeltseaborn.axisgrid.FacetGrid at 0x4a6d110gt codepre  pScreenshot of output p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5KxvK.png altp  pSo, my question boils down to this how do I have to change the function plotarea so that the axes produced by the pandas plotting function appear on the subplots created by Seaborns FacetGridp  ppandas version 0.16.0, Seaborn version 0.6.0, ipython 3.2.1, Python 2.7p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe comment by mwaskom set me on the right track I have to provide the current axes to the plot function now this seems so obvious....

MapLoader.loadAllKeys is the fastest way of prepopulating the map since Hazelcast will optimize the loading             process by having each node loading its owned portion of the entries.                       return null                   Override         public void storeString key, String value            throw new NotImplementedExceptionstore not implemented                   Override         public void storeAllMapltString, Stringgt map            throw new NotImplementedExceptionstoreAll not implemented                   Override         public void deleteString key            throw new NotImplementedExceptiondelete not implemented                   Override         public void deleteAllCollectionltStringgt keys            throw new NotImplementedExceptiondeleteAll not implemented                         Before       public void setUp throws IOException          final URL configUrl  ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader.getResourcehazelcastfortestlearningpersistence.xml         final Config config  new XmlConfigBuilderconfigUrl.build         final MyMapLoader mapLoaderInstance  new MyMapLoader         config.getMapConfigTESTMAP.getMapStoreConfig.setImplementationmapLoaderInstance         out.printlnconfig.getMapConfigTESTMAP.getMapStoreConfig.getInitialLoadMode         instance  Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstanceconfig               After       public void tearDown          Hazelcast.shutdownAll               Test       public void maploadergetForUpdateCalledOnTransactionalMaploadedFromMapLoader           arrange           act         final TransactionContext transaction  instance.newTransactionContext         transaction.beginTransaction         TransactionalMapltString, Stringgt testMap  transaction.getMapTESTMAP                    Against our expectations, the call to getForUpdate will return NULL.                   final String value  testMap.getForUpdateTESTKEY         transaction.commitTransaction           assert         assertThatvalue, equalToTESTVALUERETURNEDBYLOADER               Test       public void maploadergetCalledOnTransactionalMaploadedFromMapLoader           arrange           act         final TransactionContext transaction  instance.newTransactionContext         transaction.beginTransaction         TransactionalMapltString, Stringgt testMap  transaction.getMapTESTMAP         final String value  testMap.getTESTKEY         transaction.commitTransaction           assert         assertThatvalue, equalToTESTVALUERETURNEDBYLOADER               Test       public void maploadergetCalledOnNormalMaploadedFromMapLoader           arrange           act         MapltString, Stringgt testMap  instance.getMapTESTMAP         final String value  testMap.getTESTKEY           assert         assertThatvalue, equalToTESTVALUERETURNEDBYLOADER             codepre  pAnd the Hazelcast configuration usedp  precode    ltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt     lt Adaption of the defaulthazelcast.xml.

Negative 1695 pId like to pass an opaque data buffer from C to Lua without actually copying all the data since it could be very large 100s of MBs or GBs. p  pMore specifically, I have a C snippet that looks like thisp  precodeuint8t buffer   points to some memory sizet size   size of the buffer codepre  pMy C program doesnt know the structure of the data in the buffer. It is completely oblivious to it. It will never touch this data for anything aside from calling the Lua function responsible for consuming this data.p  pMy goal is to pass this buffer to Lua, which will then interpret the contents of the data and perform all kinds of actions based on it the Lua code knows how to determine the structure of the data based on its contents or size. Furthermore, the Lua code will not modify the buffer only read from it.p  pBelow is some sample pseudocode of my ideal functionalityp  precodebool performactionluaState L, uint8t buffer, sizet size       Pass buffer to lua     call processbuffer function written in Lua     get return from processbuffer function a boolean     freebuffer     return the result above  codepre  pThis question, I think, is related to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15396067luanewbiecluahowtopassastructbuffertoluafromclua newbie  CLua How to pass a structbuffer to lua from Ca.
