The biggest problem we have when people occasionally work from home is collaborating  its tough to work together without the benefit of a whiteboard and handwaving.p  pIt seems like software development is perfect for telecommuting, but I havent been able to find many good resources about the practical aspects of working remotely within a development team.  Has anyone else had any experience with thisp
Negative 82227 pIn Java, web apps are bundled in to WARs. By default, many servlet containers will use the WAR name as the context name for the application.p  pThus myapp.war gets deployed to a hrefhttpexample.commyapphttpexample.commyappa.p  pThe problem is that the webapp considers its root to be, well, root, or simply , whereas HTML would consider the root of your application to be myapp.p  pThe Servlet API and JSP have facilities to help manage this. For example, if, in a servlet, you do response.sendRedirectmypage.jsp, the container will prepend the context and create the url a hrefhttpexample.commyappmypage.jsphttpexample.commyappmypage.jspa.p  pHowever, you cant do that with, say, the IMG tag in HTML. If you do ltimg srcmyimage.gif you will likely get a 404, because what you really wanted was myappmyimage.gif.p  pMany frameworks have JSP tags that are context aware as well, and there are different ways of making correct URLs within JSP none particularly elegantly.p  pIts a nitty problem for coders to jump in an out of when to use an App Relative url, vs an absolute url.p  pFinally, theres the issue of Javascript code that needs to create URLs on the fly, and embedded URLs within CSS for background images and the like.p  pIm curious what techniques others use to mitigate and work around this issue. Many simply punt and hard code it, either to server root or to whatever context they happen to be using. I already know that answer, thats not what Im looking for.p  pWhat do you dop
Negative 82227 pWere developing a webbased application that allows administrators to upload plugins. All plugins are stored in a special folder outside the app root say, CPlugins and are dynamically loaded via Assembly.LoadFrom. This works just fine for the most part WebControls in the plugins are instantiated and loaded, custom classes function as expected, etc.p  pWere using a custom VirtualPathProvider to get resources out of these plugins. So, to get an embedded ASPX file, youd simply do like, MySiteembeddedResourceAssemblyMyPluginampResourceMyPage.aspx. And that works fine, too the embedded ASPX file compiles and is served up like a normal page. p  pThe problem, however, comes in when an embedded .aspx file inside of a dynamically loaded plugin references a class inside that same plugin assembly. We get compilation errors like, cannot find type or assembly MyPlugin. This is odd because, clearly, its pulling the .aspx file out of MyPlugin so how can it not find itp  pSo, Im hoping you can help me out with this. The plugin would look like thisp  pMyPlugin.dllp  ul liInternalHelperClass.csli liMyPage.aspx resource with no .cs fileli ul  pWhen MyPage.aspx contains something like, lt InternalHelperClass.WriteHelloWorld , the compilation fails. p  pHow can we get this to workp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pWe have tried using fully qualified names. No difference. It is impossible to step through  it is a compilation error when you go to the aspx page. Namespaces would not be an issue in this case since it was from an external plugin dllp  pstrongUPDATE2strongp  pJoel, I think you are onto something. Unfortunately, editing the web.config to include these assemblies isnt part of the design. Basically, we want the plugins to be completely dynamic  drop them in a folder, restart the app, and be ready to go.p

Negative 82227 pFirst, I have the following tablep  precodeCREATE TABLE CustomerHub     CustomerId INT NOT NULL,    HubId INT NOT NULL  codepre  pWhich I have mapped to the this entityp  precodepublic class CustomerHub     public int CustomerId getset    public int HubId getset     GetHashCode, Equals, Etc...  codepre  pUsing this mappingp  precodepublic class CustomerHubMap  ClassMapltCustomerHubgt     UseCompositeId       .WithKeyPropertyx gt x.CustomerId       .WithKeyPropertyx gt x.HubId  codepre  pThe problem I have is that when I create a new entity of type CustomerHub and attempt to save it, nothing is persisted to the database.  I am able to retrieve everything fine, just not save them.  For examplep  precodethis will work var x  session.CreateCriteriatypeofCustomerHub   this will not using var trans  session.BeginTransaction      var custHub  new CustomerHub CustomerId  293, HubId  1193    var y  session.SaveOrUpdatecustHub     trans.Commit  codepre  pThe odd part is that no exceptions are thrown, it simply just doesnt do anything.  I fired up NH Profiler excellent tool and it looks like it isnt issuing any type of insert command to the database.p  pThoughtsp  pemNote  I realize that this table looks much like a join table because it technically is and would best be served as a ManyToMany relationship on another entity such as Customer... but due to some extremely screwy data design ie no Hub table it is FAR simpler to map the join table to an entity and work with it that way.emp
Negative 82227 pIn the PHP world its common to create a directory called uploads or something similar in the application folder. All uploaded files are then stored there, the database containing the relative paths to those files. p  pIn the Javaservlet world however, Im not sure what the common way to handle uploaded files is. Getting the path to a directory inside the application directory can be difficult, and the entire directory could be destroyed if the WAR file is redeployed. At the moment Im storing uploaded files in the database as a blob, but this is not my preferred solution.p  pSo my question is, where should I store uploaded filesp

Negative 82227 pIm using named System V semaphores to lock a file across all my apps on OSX and linux. Not prettiest of APIs by any definition.p  pIt seems to work, but I cant quite figure out how to properly destroy the semaphore after everybody is done with it.p  pGeneral logic is like thisp  pstrongCreatingstrongp  p[1] Thread or process tries to open a semaphore set with keyt created for the file by ftok. Set contains 2 semaphores. [2] If semaphore set doesnt exist, it is created with 666 permissions. [3] Lock one of the semaphores set into released state value 1. [4] Reference count another semaphore in the same set is incremented.p  pstrongLockingunlockingstrongp  pTo lock [5], a thread decrements the value of Lock semaphore by 1 with undo, thus waiting if it is already zero. To unlock [6], thread increments it by one, thus allowing somebody else to lock it.p  pstrongDestroyingstrongp  p[7] Reference count semaphore is attempted to be decremented with IPCNOWAIT flag. [8] Its value is checked to be 0, and if it is [9] semaphore set is destroyed.p  pThere is also a layer of logic based on thread local storage to make the lock recursive within one thread.p  pThe questions are p  ul liHow do I synchronize steps [1] and [2] if semaphore set doesnt exist, but while we were counting stars, it was created by somebody else so now creation will fail tooli liHow do I synchronize steps [4] with [8] so that [9] does not kill me prematurelyli liAre there any other race conditionsli ul  pPS While POSIX semaphores have much nicer API, I dont think I can survive seminlink behavior as described herep  blockquote   pCalls to semopen to recreate or   reconnect to the semaphore refer to a   new semaphore after semunlink is   called.p blockquote  pSo I will have no way to release them...p

Negative 82227 pHey all, Im in the process of debugging a C app on mac os 10.5. Occasionally, Ill do something bad and cause a segfault or an otherwise illegal operation. This results in the app hanging for a while, and eventually a system dialog notifying me of the crash. The wait time between the hang and the dialog is significant a few minutes. If I try to force quit the application or codekill 9code it from the command line nothing happens. If I start the app from the debugger gdb, upon a crash I get back to gdb prompt and can exit the process cleanly. Thats not ideal though as gdb is slow to load.p  pAnyway, can you guys recommend something Is there a way to disable the crash reporting mechanism in OS Xp  pThanks.p  pstrongUpdate 1strong  Herere the zombies that are left over from an XCode execution.

Negative 82227 pIm making the design of a OO framework and Im facing the following problem.p  pLets say that in the framework I have a emShapeem interface and the users are free to implement and extends adding new functions the emShapeem interface to create their own figures, e.g. emSquareem and emCircleem. To make these new objects available the users have to register them into a emShapeFactoryem specifying the name of the shape string and the object.p  pFurthermore, the framework provides an interface called emShapeWorkerem which defines the following functionp  precodeclass ShapeWorker  public   void processShape Shapeamp shape   0  codepre  pThe users are free to implement the emShapeWorkerem interface to make specific shape worker, e.g. emSquareWorkerem and emCircleWorkerem. To make these new objects available the users have to register them into a emWorkerFactoryem, specifying the name of shape string and the object.p  pAt a certain point, the framework, given a string representing the shapes name, creates a new emShapeem, by using the emShapeFactoryem, and afterwards somewhere else in the code creates a new emShapeWorkerem, by using the emWorkerFactoryem with the same shapes name. The emprocessShapeem is then called providing the emShapeem instance created before.p  precode[ ... ] Shape myShape  shapeFactory.create shapeName  [ ... ] ShapeWorker myWorker  workerFactory.create shapeName  myWorkergtprocessShape myShape  [ ... ] codepre  pThe point is that, doing so, I force the user implementing, for example, the emSquareWorkerem to make a downcast from emShapeem to emSquareem into the emprocessShapeem function so to access to the full emSquareems interfacep  precodeclass SquareWorker  public   void processShape Shapeamp shape          Squareamp square  dynamiccastlt Squareamp gt shape        using Square interface     codepre  pThis is against the Liskov substitution principle.p  pNow, is this approach wrong What would it be the better solution Note that I dont want to implement the processShape as emShapeems member function.p  pI hope the description has been clear enough.p  pThanks in advance for your help.p  pSimop

Negative 82227 pI have a few questions about divide overflow errors on x86 or x8664 architecture.  Lately Ive been reading about integer overflows.  Usually, when an arithmetic operation results in an integer overflow, the carry bit or overflow bit in the FLAGS register is set.  But apparently, according to a hrefhttpwww.codeguru.comcppsamplechapterarticle.phpc11111 relnofollowthis articlea, overflows resulting from division operations dont set the overflow bit, but rather trigger a hardware exception, similar to when you divide by zero.  p  pNow, integer overflows resulting from division are a lot more rare than say, multiplication.  Theres only a few ways to even trigger a division overflow.  One way would be to do something likep  precodeint16t a  32768 int16t b  1 int16t c  a  b codepre  pIn this case, due to the twos complement representation of signed integers, you cant represent positive 32768 in a signed 16bit integer, so the division operation overflows, resulting in the erroneous value of 32768.p  pA few questionsp  p1 Contrary to what this article says, the above did NOT cause a hardware exception.  Im using an x8664 machine running Linux, and when I divide by zero the program terminates with a codeFloating point exceptioncode.  But when I cause a division overflow, the program continues as usual, silently ignoring the erroneous quotient.  So why doesnt this cause a hardware exceptionp  p2 Why are division errors treated so severely by the hardware, as opposed to other arithmetic overflows  Why should a multiplication overflow which is emmuchem more likely to accidentally occur be silently ignored by the hardware, but a division overflow is supposed to trigger a fatal interruptp  p strongEDITstrong p  pOkay, thanks everyone for the responses.  Ive gotten responses saying basically that the above 16bit integer division shouldnt cause a hardware fault because the quotient is still less than the register size.  I dont understand this.  In this case, the register storing the quotient is 16bit  which is emtoo smallem to store signed positive 32768.  So why isnt a hardware exception raisedp  pOkay, lets do this directly in GCC inline assembly and see what happensp  precodeint16t a  32768 int16t b  1  asm      xorw dx, dx             Clear the DX register upperbits of dividend     movw 1, ax               Load lower bits of dividend into AX     movw 2, bx               Load the divisor into BX     idivw bx                  Divide a  b quotient is stored in AX     movw ax, 0               Copy the quotient into b      rmb                     Output list     ira, rmb              Input list     ax, dx, bx           Clobbered registers   printfdn, b codepre  pThis simply outputs an erroneous value code32768code.  Still no hardware exception, even though the register storing the quotient AX is too small to fit the quotient.  So I dont understand why no hardware fault is raised here.  p

Negative 82227 pIm new to Threading but Ive read threads here on BackgroundWorker BW and mostly understand the material.  I suspect BW is not the correct solution but let me ask. I have an object GPS Emulator that does its work in a loop mostly waiting Thread.Sleep but occasionaly raising an event that the UI listens for.  I want the UI to be responsive of course so it would be nice to put the work of the object in the background as in gps.Start.  On the UI I want to have the ability to Pause, Resume, and Stop the GPS.  I figured I could do this by setting appropriate flags in the GPS object that would break the loop running in the background.  What I dont understand is what happens to the events that are raised by the GPS.  The Thread that the event is raised on is not the Thread that is listening and so it seems, the UI cant respond correctly as in painting the new GPS point on the UI. Am I missing something wrt BW or is there a better but still simple way of doing thisp

Negative 82227 pSo, I have finished an assembly program that asks for a character, reads it, echos it, repeats that four times, then prints out those characters in a consecutive string. I then wanted to experiment with subroutines which we havent learned about in class yet, so I made the following subroutine to print a newline character to the consolep  precodePRINTNEWLINE                         procedure to print a newline   AND   R0,R0,0                      clear output register   LD    R0,NEWLINE                    load newline into output regiester   TRAP  x21                           print it out   RET                                 jump to address in R7 codepre  pIt gets called like thisp  precodeJSR PRINTNEWLINE codepre  pAfter running this, I noticed something weird, the program seemed to stop after the first call to codePRINTNEWLINEcode. Then I realized that TRAP saves the address of the next instruction, which in this case is codeRETcode, in codeR7code, the register used for subroutine linking. This overwrites the address which was saved in codeR7code by codeJSRcode. So the reason it appears to stop is that after the codeTRAPcode routine finishes, it loads my codeRETcode instruction. Which is actually, because of the codeTRAPcode, changing the pc counter to itself. Sort of like an infinite loop. p  pThats all great, and I understand whats going on, but is there a way I can use system codeTRAPcode routines inside of my subroutine, while still using the system codeJSRcode instructionp  pI could, of course, manually store the address of the instruction after the codeJSR PRINTNEWLINEcode call into a different register, and then at the end of my codePRINTNEWLINEcode subroutine, codeJMPcode to the address in that register.p  pBut, that seems wrong to me and, Im a programmer, therefore Im lazy, and would rather just enjoy the fruits of others labor and use the combination of codeJSRcode and codeRETcode.p  pSo is it possible to call a codeTRAPcode routine in a subroutine and still use codeRETcode to return from that subroutine How would one accomplish thisp  pemstrongThanksemstrongp

I used the method given at a hrefhttpwiki.python.orgmoinPrintFailshttpwiki.python.orgmoinPrintFailsa , as given by ChrisJ in one of the comments. That is, I replace sys.stdout with a wrapper that calls unicode encode with the correct arguments. Works very well.p

Negative 82227 pAlmost 6 months ago, I asked a question on stackoverflow a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4020025softwaretohelpinloganalysisSoftware to help in log analysisap  pPlease look at that question before reading ahead.p  pIt turned out that there is no good software available currently that can intermix log files based on timestamps and present them in a good UI.p  pI wanted to take initiative and develop something and open source it once its completed.p  pEarlier, I worked around by writing a quick and dirty piece of code in c, that would generate a tab separated file like csv but tab separated which I would later opened in Excel.p  pI am not satisfied with my c code for the following reasons 1. It totally depends on Excel to view the output file later. 2. Since there is no UI involved, its not easy to write its commandline everytime. 3. Because of the learning curve of the commandline, its not so much sharable with other team members and the world.p  pFor the above reasons and a few more, I was thinking to develop that as a web solution. That way I can share the working instance with everyone.p  pWhat I have in mind is a web based solution something like thisp  ul liThe user will be able to give the input log files using HTML5s File API. li liAnd then user would probably tell the format of the timestamp associated with each log file. li liThereafter, the javascript would process those log files into intermixed HTML output in a table.li ul  pI am just a beginner in web based technologies. So I need your help in determining if this would be the best way to go about itp  pI want a web solution, but that doesnt mean I want user to upload his log files for backend processing. I want a webbased client only solution.p  pThanks for your inputs.p  pstrongEDITstrong Based on comment below by Raynos p  blockquote   pbits You do realise that browsers   were not meant to handle large pieces   of data. There was   stackoverflow.comquestions4833480   which shows that this can cause   problems.p blockquote  pI feel that doing this in browsers isnt the best deal.

Here is my approachp  pI created a new shared library containing the codegetstringvoidcode function and liked it against the library I wanted to extend. A library wrapper so to speak. So far so good.

Thats why linking against the extended library instead of the original library produces a lot of unresolved symbol warningserror.p  pIs there any way to export all those symbols of the original library there are a lot or is there a better approach to solve the problem.

Negative 82227 pI have a fairly generic C socket server that uses the asynchronous methods of the socket classes  BeginAccept, BeginReceive, etc.  This server has been working great for the last 4 years at many customer sites running Win Server 2003.  Recently I installed it on a Windows Server 2008 R2 server, 64bit.  Everything looks fine until the first client connects and issues a BeginReceive and a BeginAccept call in the accept handler.  When this happens, the CPU usage spikes to 100 and stays that way until I close the listening socket.p  pNot sure that it matters, but the server is running in a virtual machine.p  pHave done a lot of testing, but nothing seems to help.  Using Process Explorer, I can see that two threads are spun up shortly after the BeginReceiveBeginAccept calls, and they are the ones that are consuming the processor.  Unfortunately, I am not able to reproduce this problem on my Win7 64bit workstation.p  pI have done a lot of research, and all that I have found so far is the following two KB articles that imply that Server 2008 R2 may have an issue with the TCPIP components, but they are only available as hot fixes KB2465772 and KB2477730.

This will not only apply to the All Blacks haka, but the various challenges performed by the Pacific Island teams as well for moving too close to the Black Ferns while they performed their haka. The Australian Rugby Union ARU paid the fine, after it was revealed by a Sydney newspaper that there was a clause in the IRB tournament rules that dictated that teams must face the haka, and remain 10 metres on their own side of the halfway line. For the record the Black Ferns won that pool match 325. Senior IRB officials confirmed that the regulation was in place  and had been for some time  but the fine imposed on the ARU was the first time that formal action had been taken.  extensionjpg fileName261840D4CADD6C4EACAF532ACFF12388 linknews14266IRBconfirmshakawillnotbechallenged titleIRB confirms haka will not be challenged.....gt  ltnewsitemsgt codepre  pHowever, initially we only want to return the first 160 characters of the content.

Negative 82227 pIm having trouble getting the size, in pixels, of a text node using Javascript. Examplep  pre ltp   first text block   ltbsecond text blockltb ltp pre  pI need to get the bounding box of the two text blocks independently. I could get the size of the second block just by measuring the ltb element, but the first one eludes me. It doesnt appear that textnodes in Javascript have a height or width, so far as I can tell.p  pWrapping the first text block in a ltspan and measuring that is not an option, because Ive discovered that a span does not necessarily inherit all of the styles above it, and when I wrap the text it suddenly changes size. Its like the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle of Javascript my attempt to measure something changes it.p  pIm building an app that breaks HTML into pages EPUB HTML, actually, and I need to know the position, height, and width of each block of text on the page so I can know whether to put it on this page or the next page.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 82227 pIm working on a app which ties to a legacy database.  The primary model is based on a stupidly large 100 column table.  I dont know too much about the innerworkings of ActiveRecord but it seems to me that any request on this model is slowing down because its creating objects with 100 attributes.  Lets call this SlowModel.p  pRendering pages with this model sometimes take 17 seconds on my dev computer.  Straight up mysql queries only take  0.5  1 second.p  pIve managed to speed up one portion of the app by using a MySQL view that selects a subset of fields 20 or so.  Well call this QuickModel.  Using views is OK but isnt the most portable solution.p  pI will likely continue to try and add this QuickModel into other parts of the site but I was wondering if anyone had other ideas in speeding up the original object.  For instance, is there a way to specify in the model what columns activerecord should just ignore and avoid building  Maybe there are specific column types text that cause bloat in ActiveRecord objects.p  pAssume that columns have proper indices.p
Negative 82227 pI just wanted to check something before I plough more time into a problem Im having, as I want to make sure Im not trying to do something stupid or unfeasible. Currently I am working on a SharePoint project where I have created a list in Visual Studio, with various views. The requirements are that one of these views contains a number of calculations on data involving the current date, and the value of items over time. I am well aware of the Today problem, so do not want to store these pieces of data in the list, but I would like dynamically calculate the figures to show them on the list view.p  pThe problem is Im not sure if this can be done. Obviously I could hand craft a web part which in code creates a grid using the list data, but this isnt ideal as I would like to include all of the out of the box list functionality. Is there a way to customise the list view page to add columns in say XSLT or jQuery Can this be done in a Visual Studio Sandbox solution as we are trying not to use SharePoint Designer because it lacks source control and we would like to be able to deploy chunks of the system to a SharePoint site automaticallyp  pI know this is a lot of questions but Im pulling my hair out with this once, hence my asking. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 82227 pI have written a program which reads a file containing multidimensional data most commonly 3D, but 2D could occur as well. To heighten simplicity I would like to store the data in an array of the same rank or something pretending to be one, i.e. using a threedimensional array for 3D data, etc. the trouble is that the program only learns about the dimensionality on reading the data file.p  pCurrently I store all data in an array of rank one and calculate each elements index in that array from the elements coordinates this was also suggested a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2073674setrankofarrayatruntimeherea. However, I have also read about pointer rank remapping, which seems very elegant and just what I have been looking for, as it would allow me to scrap my procedures for array index determination which are probably far less efficient than what goes on behind the scenes. Now, however, it looks like Im facing the same problem as with directly declaring a multidimensional array  how to do the declaration Again, it requires information about the rank.p  pHow could I use pointer rank remapping or some other, more suitable technique for setting an arrays rank at runtime  in case this can be done at all. Or am I best off sticking to the rank onearray that I am currently usingp  pThanks a lot for your repliesp

Negative 82227 pIm thinking about building some intranet applications that make use of websockets. Im currently using PythonPylons for my web framework on the server, and doing polling to update items in the DOM of the page. Pylons is not well suited to communicate with websockets IMHO as it uses a thread per connection. Im considering using node.js as the server to communicate with the websocket connections from my web application. Heres the 10,000 foot view of my applicationp  ul liPylons delivers the web content html, css, images, javascript, etc.li liJavasSript on the page application opens up websockets to the node.js serverli liThe node.js server pushes data to the application through the websocketli liJavaScript updates the page DOM elements based on the data from the websocketli ul  pThe data in the case above comes from a MySQL database, which is where my question comes from. Ive set up MVC type applications before, and can do the same kind of thing in node.js. However, if I have a long lived websocket open to the node.js server, how does node.js become aware of changes in the Model and push them out to the application For instance if I want to update totals presented on the web application page, and those totals change due to actions in the system outside of node.js other web applications, how is node.js notified of those changes The thing that comes to mind is to have node.js poll the database for various changes and propagate the changes to the various Views. But to me that just sounds like Im moving my polling from the web application to the node.js serverp  pAnyone have any ideas, suggestions or pointers on thisp  pThanks in advance Dougp

Basically can you restrict onetomany mapping to onetoone by some condition The OBJECTSTATUSHISTORY would remain a bag or set or a list with only one object, or one object itself, it is not that important.p  pIt is a legacy database and this pattern is all around, since the database is receiving a historical input from outside, and no I cannot create a flag in OBJECT table that would give me a current status and then map it directly to NHibernate.p  pOf course, I can add to OBJECT memory class the status from OBJECTSTATUSHISTORY later, but the question is can I do this only using the mapping I can easily create an SQL statement for this object, so in essence I can create a view with the above requirement and then map it in NHibernate, but can NHibernate do this on its ownp  pLet me now if the question was not clear enough.p  pThanks.p

Negative 82227 pLost a bunch of time just trying to figure out what was going on here, but I think Im finally onto something.p  pWe have some fairly normal PicoContainer code which simply turns on caching, which I thought was supposed to result in singleton behaviourp  precodecontainer.asCharacteristics.CACHE.addComponentService.class, ServiceImpl.class codepre  pHowever as we found today, we have a component which is apparently being constructed not once, but four times. Its not something I can reproduce on my own computer, just on some other developer machines.p  pWe investigated further, and it turns out that multiple threads were hitting PicoContainer to look up the same component at the same time, and instead of instantiating one copy and making the other three threads wait, it appears that it just instantiates four copies and then only remembers to keep around one of them.p  pIs there some relatively simple way to get true singular behaviour in PicoContainerp

It all started when Teds best friend, Marshall, dropped the bombshell that he was going to propose to his longtime girlfriend, Lily, a kindergarten teacher. At that moment, Ted realized that he had better get a move on if he, too, hopes to find true love. Helping him in his quest is his friend Barney, a confirmed bachelor with endless, sometimes outrageous opinions, a penchant for suits and a foolproof way to meet women.

Negative 82227 pI am currently writing an app that calls for the recording and real time processing of audio data.  For this, I am using the AudioRecord class. This works all well and good, except the default setting for recording audio on my primary testing device, a galaxy nexus, is to record from the back speaker.  I am assuming most phones default record source will be the back, or bottom microphones, because when you are using the phone to call, your mouth is near the bottom.  p  pHowever, my app requires that I record from the speaker on the front of the phone, and so I was hoping someone could help me with how to change the AudioRecord input source programmatically.

If this should be in a new question, please let me know and I will start a new question.p  pBoth didFinishLaunchingWithOptions and openURL have to pass through the workFlowController method which then sends us to controller.rb and runs the method viewWillAppear.

Is there a way to see my logs I use log and puts within the methods in question in my console when I run rake device I would need it to still log when I completely exit the app and try to go back in via Safari because according to the Apple Docs, If an application is launched as a result of another application requesting it to open a URL resource, UIApplication first sends the application a applicationdidFinishLaunchingWithOptions message and then it invokes this method.

Negative 82227 pI have the following situationp  pI have set up a series of Cron jobs on an internal company server to run various PHP scripts designed to check data integrity. Each PHP script queries a company database, formats the returned query data into an HTML file containing one or more codelttablesgtcode, and then mails the HTML file to several client emails as an attachment. From my experience, most of the PHP scripts generate HTML files with only a few tables, however there are a few PHP scripts the create HTML files with around 30 tables. HTML files have been chosen as the distribution format of these scans because HTML makes it easy to view many tables at once in a browser window.p  pI would like to add the functionality for the clients to download a table in the HTML file as a CSV file. I anticipate clients using this feature when they suspect a data integrity issue based on the table data. It would be ideal for them to be able to take the table in question, export the data out to a CSV file, and then study it further. p  pemBecause need for exporting the data to CSV format is at the discretion of the client, unpredictable as to what table will be under scrutiny, and intermittently used I do not want to create CSV files for every table.em p  pNormally creating a CSV file wouldnt be too difficult, using JavaScriptjQuery to preform DOM traversal and generate the CSV file data into a string utilizing a server call or flash library to facilitate the download process but I have one limiting constraint The HTML file needs to be portable. p  pI would like the clients to be able to take their HTML file and preform analysis of the data outside the company intranet. Also it is likely these HTML files will be archived, so making the export functionality self contained in the HTML files is a highly desirable feature for the two previous reasons. p  pThe portable constraint of CSV file generation from a HTML file meansp  ol lipI cannot make a server call. This means strongALLstrong the file generation must be done clientside.pli lipI want the single HTML file attached to the email to contain all the resources to generate the CSV file. This means I cannot use jQuery or flash libraries to generate the file.pli ol  pI understand, for obvious security reasons, that writing out files to disk using JavaScript isnt supported by any browser.

Negative 82227 pThis is a very fun problem I am running into. I did a lot of searching on stack overflow and found others had some similar problems. So I wrote my code accordingly. I originally had codefscancode and codestrcmpcode, but that completely bombed on me. So other posts suggested codefgetscode and codestrncmpcode and using the length to compare them. p  pI tried to debug what I was doing by printing out the size of my two strings. I thought, maybe they have codencode floating in there or something and messing it up another post talked about that, but I dont think that is happening here. So if the size is the same, the limit for codestrncmpcode should be the same. Right Just to make sure they are supposedly being compared right. Now, I know that if the strings are the same, it returns code0code otherwise a negative with codestrncmpcode.

Negative 82227 pFor some reason, black boxes are displaying in random spaces in Chrome latest build.p  pSome of these boxes are appearing outside of the main container, whereas some are appearing inline, covering content blocks. They appear randomly, usually after scrolling, and will often disappear when opening the inspector, hovering over elements, or scrolling down and back up.p  pFor reference, there are some animations, boxshadows which have been disabled with no luck, linear gradients, and position fixed elements on the page, although this is not an issue with browsers other than Chrome.p  pThis has been widely reported in user testing, although I have not been able to conjure up a fix.

Negative 82227 pI have a strange problem in which I am trying to set a custom UIView object to have a delegate which is a custom tab bar controller.  The tab bar controller is being set as the delegate and I am positive it is not nil then, and it infact is set  However later on when the custom UIView performs its task, the delegate is nil.p  pI am using ARC and I made sure that the object is strong even though the tab bar in question is inside a UINavBar so it should not be getting released...p  pI am starting to think that there is no way that the UITabBar is actually getting released, because it quite clearly still exists...  Im also quite certain I am setting it as the delegate in the appropriate way.  p  pI set the delegate inside a ViewDidLoad of one of the ViewControllers held by the UITabViewController.

Negative 82227 pMy app downloads some images and creates text files from parsed JSON values. The downloaded images and the content from the text files are then shown to the viewer in a different view controller.p  pEarlier in my first submission of the app, I got rejected because I completely forgot to handle those downloaded files which were downloaded into Documents directory before submitting my app. But ever since, I have doubled down in making sure my app as perfect as possible which means reading and rereading Data storage guidelines and Human Interface Guidelines so that my app doesnt get rejected when I submit it again.p  pSo I have few questions regarding handling data and memoryp  pstrongBeforestrong I was saving all the downloaded content from the internet into Documents directory which I realize now was a mistake. I was then creating a plist file which had the path of the downloaded images and text. So all I had to do in another view controller was to open the plist file, read the images and text file path, and load the content to show it to the user.p  pI forgot to delete those downloaded files when the view controller closed although, I was overwriting the existing files in the next app run. The result was, when you launched the app, there was about 15 mb of data already there from the previous session which was never deleted but were overwritten when the user did another search.p  pstrongAfterstrong I have taken these following steps a Now I am downloading all my internet data into tmp directory. Once the 2nd view controller closes and the user has viewed all the content, I delete all my files including the plist files from tmp directory.p  pb At app launch time, I also check if there were any remaining files from previous launch what if the app got terminated. If I find any downloaded files from previous session, I delete them.p  pc When the user adds a particular data to hisher favorites e.g. favorite news article, then I save the corresponding image and text to DocumentsData directory, and create a Favorites PList file in Documents directory which stores the path of the users favorite data. This plist file and the favorite files do not get deleted, unless the user deletes the article from the tableview.p  pstrongQ 1strong Is above a good approach Should I be saving these content to LibraryCaches or is tmp goodp  pstrongQ 2strong I am not using iCloud but at the same time, I want to ensure that if the user has any favorites, they should get backed up to the iCloud. Is this okay, or do I really have to use do not back up attribute for the favorite filesp  pemstrongEDITSemstrong Alan Duncan  Thanks for the memory leaks answer.p  pI have removed the questions regarding the memory leaks. Regarding data storage questions, they are both related to Apples Human Interface Guidelines. But if you can answer anyone of those remaining questions, it will be valuable.p

Negative 82227 pIm trying to use openfiles.exe to grab the information of what files are currently open on a remote server. I can run the command from the command prompt that the webserver is on, so I know that it works between the webserver and the server Im trying to target. However, when I try to call the same command in PHP, I get an Apache Error Log Entry of ERROR The Target system must be running Windows XP or above. The webserver is running on Xp Pro, and the target server is on Windows Server 2003. From a command prompt the command runs flawlessly, even to older Windows 2000 servers on the network, its just when I run it from PHP that it appears to have a problem. Does anyone have any ideas as to why andor how to get around thisp  pThe code that Im using isp  precodeoutput  shellexecopenfiles query s servername echo output   i  0   c  countoutput    while i lt c      dump  output[i]     echo dump .ltbrgt     i    codepre  pshellexec, system and exec all behave exactly the same, as does running the command from a batch file. A slightly interesting turn is that if I drop the s servername part, it does output the followingp  precodeFiles Opened Remotely via local share points  INFO No shared open files found. codepre  p... so its as if the s flag is whats throwing it. Like I say, it works fine from command prompt, so I know that the executable is capable of pulling the information from the target server I just need to find out why PHP seems to have a problem with doing the same...p

Negative 82227 pIs it possible to compare more than a pair of numbers in one instruction using SSE4p  pa hrefhttpsoftware.intel.comsitesdefaultfilesm942d517971intel20sse420programming20reference.pdfIntel Referencea says the following about PCMPGTQp  blockquote   pPCMPGTQ  Compare Packed Data for Greater Thanp      pPerforms an SIMD compare for the packed quadwords in the destination   operand  first operand and the source operand second operand.

Once they load then Isotope kicks in and creates the layout, resizing the images to the container and arranging them horizontal.  p  pSince this site is going to be resizable, the images are saved in a larger format to maintain quality.  I updated the images to load large images from a server.p  pI would like the images not to show until the Isotope script kicks in.p  pEdit 3p  pOk, I think I understand what imagesLoaded does.  It doesnt preload the images and hide them until its done, then trigger Isotope, which is what I was under the impression it does.  What I did to get around my issue is add hide on document ready and then a show on window.load.

I have a list of checkboxes built from an sql db. I use php to write jquery that gets the correct checked boxes based on data in the db. I then have this script click the needed checkboxes. Each click is then to populate an array. This array will contain the data needed from the jquery clicked boxes and any boxes checked or unchecked by the user. This array is to be used by another php script to change the db based on the changes in what boxes are checked.p  pHere is the problemp  pThe boxes that are supposed to be checked correctly get checked but. The array that is supposed to get populated doesnt get correctly populated all the time. Most noticeably the array is empty if only one of the check boxes is initially checked. The user unchecking then checking again seems to fix this but obviously this isnt ideal. Sometimes when 2 are checked one of the checkboxes data doesnt enter the array. Any amount past this seems OK.p

Negative 82227 pI built an Android app that monitors the users consumption sentreceived SMS, incomingoutgoing calls, bytes of data sentreceived via mobile internet and via WiFiLAN, and the network roaming state during any of those transactions.

Im now being asked to create an iOS version of the app, but since Im new to iPhone development, Im not even sure if its possible. So, my questions are...p  ol lipIs it possible to detect when the user sends or receives an SMS I need to be able to log the time when they were sent or received, the originating and target mobile numbers, the network roaming state, and number of characters inside the SMS. It looks like this isnt possible from my current research the iOS SDK only allows you to send SMSes, but the answers Ive read are from about 2 years ago.pli lipIs it possible to detect the incomingoutgoing calls I need to be able to log the time when the call started, when the call was answered, and when it ended. From what Ive read, theres the codeCTCallCentercode class, but it doesnt look like I can use it when my app is in the background. I need something more like Androids codeBroadcastReceivercode that fires a systemwide event that I can catch when a call arrives or is being made.pli lipIs it possible to get the number of bytes sentreceived via the mobile interface 3G, 4G, and via the network interface WiFi The only documentation Ive found is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7946699iphonedatausagetrackingmonitoringthisa, but it doesnt make any sense to me.pli lipIs it possible to get the network roaming state during any of those transactions What Ive found is that its possible, but only if I jailbreak the phone.

Negative 82227 pThe select values are confusing me. When the user edits a row in my app I clone a tag with jquery called emptyX and put it on a modal window so that the user can edit the values.

His previous local changes matter now. I have to clone the current record with currency inside back in the modal window, so the user can see what he had changed previously and verify it.

Is there a setting Im missing or something Im just overlooking  Im still pretty new to Ext JS and dont fully understand how everything works or ties together yet.p  pHeres my codep  precode    ltDOCTYPE htmlgt   lthtmlgt ltheadgt     lttitlegtGrid Testinglttitlegt     ltscript typetextjavascript srcjsext4.1.1aextall.jsgtltscriptgt      ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefhttpcdn.sencha.comext4.1.1agplresourcescssextalldebug.css gt      ltstyle typetextcssgt         .xselectable, .xselectable               mozuserselect textimportant             khtmluserselect textimportant                  .xgridroweditorbuttons             display none              ltstylegt  ltheadgt  ltbodygt          ltdiv idgridexamplegtltdivgt    ltscript typetextjavascriptgt Ext.application     name myGrid,         autoCreateViewport false,     launch function           Ext.require[             Ext.grid.,             Ext.data.,             Ext.util.,             Ext.state.,             Ext.form.,         ]                     MODEL                   var model  Ext.defineAnswer,              extend Ext.data.Model,             fields [                 name answernumber,                 type float,                 convert null,                 defaultValue undefined             ,                              name answertext,                 type float,                 convert null,                 defaultValue undefined             ,                              name datacolumn,                 type float,                 convert null,                 defaultValue undefined             ],             idProperty answernumber                                STORE                    sample static data for the store         var myData  [[1, test answer 1, 12], [2, test answer 2, 12], [3, test answer 3, 12], [4, test answer 4, 12], [5, test answer 5, 12]]          create the data store         var store  Ext.createExt.data.ArrayStore,              model Answer,             data myData,             autoSync true,             autoLoad true,                    var rowEditing  Ext.createExt.grid.plugin.RowEditing,              clicksToEdit 1,             autoCancel false,                   var columns  [                 text ,                 width 40,                 sortable false,                 dataIndex answernumber             ,                              text Answer,                 flex 1,                 sortable false,                 dataIndex answertext,                 editor                      allowBlank true                              ,                              text Data Column,                 width 75,                 sortable false,                 dataIndex datacolumn             ]           create the Grid         var grid  Ext.createExt.grid.Panel,              store store,             stateful true,             collapsible false,             multiSelect true,             columns columns,             height 150,             width 600,             renderTo gridexample,             plugins [rowEditing],          end grid           grid.getEl.addKeyMap             eventName keyup,             binding [                                       Navigate through the answers or create a new one if at the end                     key Ext.EventObject.DOWN,                     fn  function                         store.commitChanges  this doesnt seem to be working                         var currentRow  grid.getSelectionModel.getSelection[0]                         var rowCount  store.count                         ifcurrentRow[index]1 lt rowCount                             select next row                             rowEditing.startEditcurrentRow[index]1, 1                         else                             create new one with dummy data                             var r  Ext.createAnswer,                                  answernumber 9,                                 answertext ,                                 datacolumn 50                                                          store.insertrowCount, r                             rowEditing.startEditrowCount, 1                                                               ,                                       Navigate up through the answers                     key Ext.EventObject.UP,                     fn  function                         store.commitChanges                         var currentRow  grid.getSelectionModel.getSelection[0]                         rowEditing.startEditcurrentRow[index]1, 1                                                    ]                 ,  ltscriptgt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pAny help is very much appreciated.

Negative 82227 h1Problemh1  pbr  Im using Symfony2 with AJAX to insert a new record in my locations table. I can easily pass the data I want from the form to my Controller that handles that AJAX request. I checked with Firebug and all the GET values are as I wanted.

Negative 82227 pIm looking to do a matrix multiply using threads where each thread does a single multiplication and then the main thread will add up all of the results and place them in the appropriate spot in the final matrix after the other threads have exited. p  pThe way I am trying to do it is to create a single row array that holds the results of each thread. Then I would go through the array and add  place the results in the final matrix.p  pEx If you have the matricesp  pA  [1,4, 2,5, 3,6] B  [8,7,6, 5,4,3]p  pThen I want an array holding [8, 20, 7, 16, 6, 12, 16 etc] I would then loop through the array adding up every 2 numbers and placing them in my final array.p  pThis is a HW assignment so I am not looking for exact code, but some logic on how to store the results in the array properly. Im struggling with how to keep track of where I am in each matrix so that I dont miss any numbers.p  pThanks.p  pEDIT2 Forgot to mention that there must be a single thread for every single multiplication to be done.

Negative 82227 pOkay so essentially what Im doing, is Im taking all the directories inside of the servers folder, and moving them to a secondary hard drive mounted at mediabackupdrive.

Negative 82227 pIn Python, is it safe to give keyword arguments that are emnotem Python identifiers to a function Here is an examplep  precodegtgtgt xy.formatxy 3   The keyword argument is not a valid Python identifier 3 gtgtgt xy.formatxy3   File ltipythoninput12722afdf7cfa3gt, line 1 SyntaxError keyword cant be an expression codepre  pI am asking this because it is more convenient for me to format with names that contain a dash because the values correspond to commandline argument with dashes in their name. But is this behavior reliable i.e. can it vary between version of Pythonp  pI am not sure that using nonidentifiers as keyword arguments is officially supported in fact, the a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2referenceexpressions.htmlcalls relnofollowdocumentationa readsp  blockquote   pIf the syntax expression appears in the function call, expression   must evaluate to a mapping, the contents of which are treated as   additional keyword arguments.p blockquote  p where keyword arguments are defined as having a name which is an emidentifieremp  blockquote   pkeywordarguments      keyworditem , keyworditemp      pkeyworditem           identifier  expressionp blockquote  pwhere a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2referencelexicalanalysis.htmlgrammartokenidentifier relnofollowidentifiersa are restricted in what characters they can use codecode is for instance forbiddenp  blockquote   pidentifier   letter letter  digit  p blockquote  pSo, the documentation indicates that the mapping given to codecode in a function call should only contain valid identifiers as keys, but CPython 2.7 accepts more general keys for codeformatcode and functions with a codecode argument, which do not put values in variables.

Negative 82227 pTAction has a OnHint event, but unfortunately not a OnHideHint event. This has the following drawback I have ToolButtons and other controls associated with actions. Whenever the mouse is over such a control, the hint of the Action is shown in the StatusBar I have set the StatusBars AutoHint property to True. But when the mouse leaves the ToolButton, the previous custom text in the StatusBar which is not from a hint is NOT automatically restored Now I could write an OnMouseLeave event handler for each and every control on the form to restore my custom text in the StatusBar, but this would be cumbersome Isnt there something which automatically restores the previous text in the StatusBar An OnHideHint event in TAction would be idealp

Negative 82227 pIm trying to wrap my head around some of the syntax and structure for parallel tasks in C, specifically around a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd537612.aspx relnofollowchaining multiple tasksa and a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd537614.aspx relnofollowhandling errorsa.p  pThe specific sequence of steps Im looking to create arep  ul liSpawn a parallel task and immediately return to the UI.li liIn the parallel task ul liDo codeProcess1codeli liIf codeProcess1code completes without error, do codeProcess2codeli liIf codeProcess2code completes without error, do codeProcess3codeli liIf all tasks complete without error, do codeSuccessConditioncodeli liIf any task resulted in an error, do codeErrorConditioncodeli ulli ul  pIts my understanding that I would create a codeTaskcode and call codeContinueWithcode to chain more tasks, passing in a codeTaskContinuationOptionscode flag to determine when to do that continuation.  Additionally, that successerror conditions would fall through all of the continuations to the end.  So Im currently trying thisp  precodevar task  new Task gt Process1 var task2  task.ContinueWitht gt Process2, TaskContinuationOptions.OnlyOnRanToCompletion var task3  task2.ContinueWitht gt Process3, TaskContinuationOptions.OnlyOnRanToCompletion var task4  task3.ContinueWitht gt SuccessConditiont, TaskContinuationOptions.OnlyOnRanToCompletion var task5  task4.ContinueWitht gt ErrorConditiont, TaskContinuationOptions.NotOnRanToCompletion task.Start codepre  pIt appears to be behaving as expected, except that within codeErrorConditioncode the instance of codetcode doesnt appear to have an exception, even if I manually threw one from within, say, codeProcess2code.  Looking at the MSDN article for handling exceptions, it says to do thisp  precodetry      task.Wait  catch AggregateException ex       Handle exceptions from a collection on ex  codepre  pHowever, I tried that and it doesnt seem to have the exceptions there either.  Also, by calling code.Waitcode in the main thread like that, am I negating the parallelism and just blocking  It appears that way in my tests.p  pSo I guess my question is... Whats the correct way to chain dependent tasks and handle an overall successerror condition here  Or, how should exceptions thrown from within these tasks be properly caught, while still returning immediately to the UIp

Negative 82227 pThat may sound like a silly question but Id like to gather some input regarding this. Im used to see 2 flavors of handling exception messages. First there is the simple pattern where you show the codeMessagecode directly to the userp  precodetry      service.Update  catch Exception ex     ShowMessageex.Message  codepre  pThe alternative way of treating exceptions is to consider stronglytyped exceptions to mean something that is then interpreted by the controller class or whatever piece of code than handles pushing information to the userp  precodetry      service.Update  catch NetworkException ex      ShowMessageNetwork is unavailable.  catch Exception ex      ShowMessageSomething went wrong with the update.  codepre  pThe first approach requires that every message used by exceptions whether passed in the constructor by the calling code or managed inside a stronglytyped exception be userready clean, properly formulated and localized, etc.. The second approach transfers this responsibility to the controller code. Plus it might require having very specific stronglytyped exceptions to make sure that every catch block is able to interpret them correctly.p  pSo to whom is aimed the Message property of the Exception class in C, Java... The enduser or the programmerp  pThank you,p

Negative 82227 pI am playing with using generics to be able to restrict subtypes in a composite hierarchy, so that I could force different types at different layers of a hierarchy.p  pFor example having a BusinessDivisionDepartmentGroupPerson hierarchy, where the composite nodes at each level would only accept child nodes of the proper type the next lower level in the hierarchy. So I would construct the levels in the composite using generics at each level type instantiated to accept only nodes from the next lower level.p  pBut I get an error with the generics, and am not sure if it indicates a design error, or just something that java Generics cant do for me. The idea seems valid, I just want to restrict the types accepted by the add methods to only accept a subtype from the specific next level in the hierarchy to force the levels of structure. Since I am just lowering the upperbound on the type at each stage, all messages sent to the list would still be valid.p  pTop level node in the typical GOFComposite patternp  precode   public abstract class Business  ...  codepre  pComposite node hierarchy top levelp  precode  public abstract class Group extends Business       protected ListltBusinessgt subs       composite links     public Group addBusiness comp          subs.addcomp         return this      codepre  pSubsequent levels in the composite hierarchyp  precode public class ArealtT extends Businessgt extends Group       protected ListltBusinessgt subs       composite links      public AreaString title         supertitle         subs  new ArrayListltBusinessgt           Override     public Group addT comp       Error Here          super.addcomp         return this      codepre  pThe Error isp  blockquote precode Multiple markers at this line      The method addT of type ArealtTgt must override a superclass method codepre      p Name clash The method addT of type Area has the same erasure as addBusiness of type Group but does not override itp blockquote  pI tried a variation where I gave a similar type to the Groupadd method so they would have the same type signatures,p  ppublic  Group addT comp   ... p  pBut that fails similarlyp  blockquote precode Multiple markers at this line codepre      p The method addT of type Area must override a superclass method      overrides labs.composite.company.Group.add      Name clash The method addT of type Area has the same erasure as addT of type Group but does not override itp blockquote  pAm I missing something here TIAp  pPS Actually I think that this use of generics does not do exactly what I want anyway even if it did work, since i want to not only change the upperbound at each level, but require a specific single level in the type hierarchy, not any covariant argument type. I really would want something like, emfor any type T which is a subtype of Composite, accept only that type of object in the add methodem, I think that instead the generics says emaccept any object as an argument which is a subtype of Compositeem. I suppose that is impossible since arguments in Java are covariant, and LSP will always allow subtypes to be used.p

Negative 82227 pI have a MySQL DB that needs to provide attributes associated with a taxonomy. I desire to have a list of all attributes, including inherited attributes for a given element in the taxonomy. Im not an SQL expert amp have learned and plagiarized much from this site. One thing I learned here is to use a Closure Table to represent my Hierarchy. What I need to do for my database is associate a large number of attributes to elements within hierarchy.  However, I cant seem to figure out how to grab all of the attributes associated with a given node and all of its parents. I created the following example database for the purpose of this question feel free to comment on anything about this schema, the fake data is just noise.p  pMy example MySQL database structure looks

Negative 82227 pIm using knollearys Arduino library for MQTT connected to RabbitMQ with the MQTT plugin. Whilst the RabbitMQ configuration example states that I can set prefetch, it doesnt seem to have any effect.p  pMy messages are large and take time to process on the Arduino and it seems theyre pulled instantly by the Arduino until the ethernet buffer is full and it falls over  I cant see any going into ready in the RabbitMQ management console.p  pIs this because the Arduino library does not support Qos1, so the prefetch is ignored without acknowledgement Im assuming so as in AMQP prefetch requires ack as well. Any way round this without adding Qos1 to the library which is a bit beyond me and it seems the library has not been updated for quite a while so Qos1 seems not likely to appear.p

Negative 82227 pI working with codeUIGestureRecognizercode atm creating some map alike program.p  pMy work require me to listen to both long press gesture and pan gesture separate, so each of them can do their own task.

It kind of like drag a marker around in google map.

Negative 82227 pI am refining a DLL module that acts as a sort of plugin for a Windows application.p  pThis plugin is compatibile with various versions of a single software line.  Now, for a certain functionality, I have to access the configuration files of the parent software. Since different versions of the software have these in different places, I have to find out which version loads the DLL. The separate versions are readily discernable by the process executable name i.e. abcv1.exe, abcv2.exe, abcv3.exe.p  pIs there a way to get the name of the process that loaded the DLL I am using C with some basic WinAPI commands, but not ATL, MFC or such.p  pCurrently I am polling the parent software by use of its own SDK functions, but that requires opening a connection. Depending on content of the configuration files, the DLL does not need to open a connection, so I would like to know which version loaded it before having to establish communication.p

Negative 82227 pIn Visual Studio 2012 its a lot of margins to the left of source code text Indicator Margin, Selection Margin and Outline Margin. As an old programmer i prefer an uncluttered text, so i want all 3 margins to be hidden from me. In Text editor settings i can hide indicator and selection margins, but i didnt found how to hide an outline margins. Outline graphics all this  things and ines can be easily hidden from edit menu, but margins itself remains. Is it possible to hide it or such feature is not implemented In previous versions of Visual Studio it autohides if selection margin was disabled, but now it seems that it dont hide at all .p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDFG1d.png altenter image description herep  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pA little clarification why I need it. As correctly mentioned in comments, its very unusual to have preferences for text formatting and appearance. I agree with that. Unfortunately, in my personal case, I work with text like 10 hours per day for dozens of years and my brain is kind of trained to calculate indentation from text editor left edge. And every time I work in Visual Studio my wrong indentation instinct is often triggered by this empty space . Of course i can retrain myself, but since ALL editors except Visual Studio displays text close to left edge, I will try to configure Visual Studio first.p

The code i have written for the same is as belowp  precode searchView.setBackgroundColorColor.RED     searchView.setPadding0, 0, 0, 0      searchView.setIconifiedByDefaulttrue     int searchPlateId  searchView.getContext.getResources.getIdentifierandroididsearchplate, null, null     View searchPlate  searchView.findViewByIdsearchPlateId     searchPlate.setBackgroundColorColor.BLUE     searchPlate.setPadding0,0,0,0      int searchTextId  searchPlate.getContext.getResources.getIdentifierandroididsearchsrctext, null, null     final TextView searchText  TextView searchPlate.findViewByIdsearchTextId      searchText.setPadding0,0,0,0     searchText.setBackgroundColorColor.GRAY      int searchImgId  getResources.getIdentifierandroididsearchbutton, null, null     ImageView v  ImageView searchView.findViewByIdsearchImgId     v.setBackgroundDrawablenull     v.setPadding0, 0, 0, 0     v.setImageResourceR.drawable.search codepre  pCan we do this by any means I have noticed one thing that the search view xml layout uses padding.Can that be the reason for this p  pI have seen lot of post for customizing Actionbar and search view but no one answers my question exactly.p  pPlease suggest.p

Im sorry, but Ive never used DirectX before, and I simply hoped to start doing stuff with the sample, so I dont have any background on how to debug these errors. They sound not even related to DirectX.p  pThis may or may not be important. I have had a number of problems with DirectX not for development before. A number of games I own will not start, complaining about DirectX doing something wrong. Whenever I try to run a DirectX runtime standalone installer, I get the message, This version of DirectX is not compatible with the version of windows currently installed. I dont know if this is related. And its a whole other thing Ive spent tons of time trying to fix, finding no information on, but thats a whole different story.p  pI run Windows 8.1 It was originally Windows 8 and I updated normally. DXDiag says I have DirectX 11.p  pThis has been quite frustrating, as when code doesnt work, I expect it to be my fault. When my compiler is given good code and it doesnt work, I get frustrated. Thank you for helping.p  pEDIT Thanks to Drop, for pointing out the obviously corrupted nature of xmemory0 in contrast with the plaintext in the others in that folder, this file looked like a nuclear meltdown. So if any of you could simply copy and paste in their xmemory0 to an answer, to save me the trouble of reinstalling I would be very glad. Thanksp  pEDIT 2 OK, looks like indeed there are a number of corrupted files and reinstalling VS for Desktop and for Windows Store did nothing to fix them. I tried copying files from VS 2012, but those too give errors, this time unrelated to a corrupted file. So what I am now asking for is please a zipped up include directory CProgram Files x86Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0VCinclude. Thank youp

Negative 82227 pIm trying to write a program which is a game that generates random letters and the user    selects whether random generated letters are part of users name. I have not started the second algorithm, I want to focus on the first one.p  pUPDATE Hey, so I followed you guys advice and I was able to get the algorithm 1 to work.               Now the only thing for me to finish algorithm 1 is to have a loop that checks whether the   randomly generated letter is in the wrongLetters arrayList. If it is, then it would generate another random letter and if its not part of the arrayList, it would ask the user whether its the next letter. The wrongLetters arraylist should hold several strings letters that are not the   next letter in user name.

Negative 82227 pIm trying to get a layer control working that will not only change the tilejson map layers, but also select the appropriate layer interaction mouseover for the selected layer. Im using the infostraems mbtilesphp code to serve mbtile maps from TillMill on my webserver. Ive successfully got the code to initiate the map, and a layer control with the layers I want to show on the map. When I select the layers in the layer control box it will change the map to that layer, however the mouseover tooltip window only shows information for the original layer  not the new selected layer. Im sure there is probably a simple solution to this, but Im a noob with js and cant seem to figure it out.

Negative 82227 pLets say we have a parentchild relationship defined in our stateProvider as followsp  precode    .statemyProfile,          url myprofile,         templateUrl myprofile.html,         controller MyProfileController     .statemyProfile.edit,          url edit,         templateUrl myprofile.edit.html,         controller EditMyProfileController      codepre  pThe idea here is that the parent codemyProfilecode state is noneditable, but the child codemyProfile.editcode state is the actual form to edit the profile.

Negative 82227 pSo I have very simple code structure I have only one controller excluding the login and base controllers  the codeHomecode controller and all actions that I call are from there. I had to implement a breadcrumb and since its only one controller I decided that I wont use stuff like codemvcsitemapprovidercode or something else of that matter but instead stick to something simple like this one that I now have p  precode ifViewContext.RouteData.Values[action]  Index                      ltdiv classtopheaderlinksgt                 Html.ActionLinkViewContext.RouteData.Values[action].ToString, ViewContext.RouteData.Values[action].ToString, ViewContext.RouteData.Values[controller].ToString              ltdivgt                  ltdiv classtopheaderlinksgt             Html.ActionLinkHome, Index, Home         ltdivgt codepre  pWhich actually is not much at all, but I was satisfied since. But now I see that there are some certain cases like codeHomeNewscode and codeHomeShortNewscode which are both actions in my codeHomecode controller so one could say that they are on the same level, but still the logical connection is that codeShortNewscode is a node of the more general codeNewscode so in my breadcrumb I ultimately would like to have codegtHomegtNewsgtShortNewscode but in the way its implemented now obviously its not gonna happen.p  pSo what I can think about now is using codeViewBag.SecondActioncode or something and populate it in those actions that I know that are called from inside another action and just put one more check in my codeLayoutcode page for codeif ViewBag.SecondAction  nullcode and then add what I want. For now this would do the job but as I see it, it doesnt seem scalable, and if the project grows I think this would be hard to maintain and probably no very efficient as there may be more conditions than there are now. So still Im looking for some standard solution, by standard I mean that I would be happy if I dont have to install third party software and just write the code myself but also I want it to be a little more generic, at least to handle this case that Ive described. p  pSince most of the suggestions I saw were to just use codemvcsitemapprovidercode I want to know if I can modify my code so that I get the desired result and if I only want to include one more action is there an easy way to do this, at least easier than using codemvcsitemapprovidercodep

Negative 82227 pA problem I have come across using the a hrefhttpbost.ocks.orgmikesankey relnofollowd3 sankeya implementation is that theres no way to specify where on the x axis a node is. Ive been poking through the source and there isnt really a clean way to specify the x value on a reasonable scale ie, 15 where the chart is 5 nodes wide. I am creating something that can be used like a course planner for education, so the x value will correspond with the semester. Supposing I had a course I couldnt take until my sophomore year of college, this would be at an x of 3 12 are freshman, 34 sophomore, etc. The problem is, if there is nothing that links to this course beforehand, it will always be at an x of 1, so I would like to push it to the right two spaces. p  pI have noticed that the x value in the actual sankey chart does not reflect how many nodes across it is, so this is a bit difficult to do.p  pIve also come across a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18653784d3sankeyisitpossibletoaffectordecidetheplacementofnodesthis questiona, and I realize that by default the chart will not let me position a node.

Negative 82227 pI am using a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1550libsutilityoperators.htm relnofollowBoostOperatatorsa to construct a matrix class. A toy project. However, I run into issues when I want to mix matrices of different element types.p  pBasically I have a template class codeMatrixltTgtcode, where codeTcode is the element type of that matrix. Im using BoostOperators to define operators between instances of codeMatrixltTgtcode e.g. elementwise add, between codeMatrixltTgtcode and codeTcode e.g. scalar multiplication, and if possible also between codeMatrixltTgtcode and codeMatrixltUgtcode e.g. real matrix plus complex matrix.p  pThe boost operators support one, or two template arguments. One if you want operators between two objects of the same type, and two if you want mixed operators.p  precodetemplatelttypename Tgt class Matrix  boostaddableltMatrixltTgtgt  Add another matrix of same type.                boostmultiplyable2ltMatrixltTgt,Tgt  Scalar multiplication with a T. codepre  pHowever, I cannot give codeMatrixltUgtcode as a second argument, because then my class would have two template arguments and the type would depend on which matrices I can operate with.p  precodetemplatelttypename T, typename Ugt class Matrix  boostaddable2ltMatrixltT,Ugt,MatrixltU,gtgt  Now I have two template arguments.

Negative 82227 pI use C 11 features activelly. I have program created in Visual Studio 2013 that relies on lambdas to run multiple threads lambda represents task, and thread receives lambda instance that it has to run. Lambda is defined in static library and linked in executable file that calls it from thread created by this executable file. When I try to debug Linux version of this application with GDB, it looks like GDB can not step into method that contains lambda. It can not set breakpoints in this function, and when I try to step into, it even steps in methods that lambda calls from its body, but after codereturncode from these methods it doesnt go to lambda body, it goes to next method that lambda calls, etc. Are there any way to debug lambdas body with GDBp

Negative 82227 pIm creating a simple WYSIWYG editor for HTML in C, and I want to implement a simple group of controls to view and manipulate the various properties of HTML form elements. I envision the properties panel to look like the one in Visual Studiop  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqWydN.png altPicture of the properties box in visual studiop  pSuch that when the user clicks on an HTML element theyve added they can change the text, class, id, etc. of the element. The problem is, I cant find how to make a panel that looks like this using C. Obviously I know how to implement the dropdown list and the buttons, but the main body that actually contains the properties is like a slick version of a treeview that I dont even know where to begin coding.p  pIm not looking for someone to code this whole thing for me, but it would be great if somebody could point me to a form control that looks like the treeview. I have tried googling around for answers but havent had any luck. I have also tried looking at the open source project a hrefhttpwww.icsharpcode.netOpenSourceSDDefault.aspx relnofollowSharp Developa which uses a similar control, but Ive had considerable trouble wading through the hundreds of files of code to find the specific part of the GUI Im focused on.p  pAny help on this would be greatly appreciated.

I have moved it from codeinitWithSizecode to codedidMoveToViewcode due to a suggestion here on Stackoverflow, but that did not help. It is possible to manually offset the border with hardcoded values, but that does not satisfy me.delp  pdel2.

Negative 82227 pIve been bashing my head on this problem for a while now.p  pIm dealing with properties setting using the DBusjava bindings for DBus. When Set is called, the value to set is wrapped in a org.freedesktop.types.Variant object from which I have to extract it. Normally if the data is a primitive I can use generics in the Set parameters and the bindings does the type conversion before calling the Set method.p  pHowever I am trying to set using a org.freedesktop.types.DBusStructType which is a complex type and which needs to be manually unpacked. So far Ive gotten to the point where I can extract the type from the variant but I cant cast the value wrapped in the Variant to a DBusStructType even though it is clearly identified as a DBusStructTypep  pThe following code throws a codeClassCastException  Cannot cast [Ljava.lang.Object to org.freedesktop.dbus.types.DBusStructTypecode when called with a DBus.Struct from a python dbus test.

Negative 82227 pOn Rails 4. I have three Models for this question codeUserscode, codeOrganizationscode, and codeUserOrganizationscode.

However, to assign that user to an organization, I have a dropdown select, listing all the organizations in the database by name.p  pThis is fine in the dev environment but not so great when I will eventually have over a thousand organizations.p  pWhat I would like to do is have a sort of text lookup input where the user can type in an organizations name and then all orgs in the database containing that name will display. Then the user can select the name through a radio button maybe to tell the app which org heshe would like to be assigned. Ideally, this would happen on the same pageno reload.p  pWhat is the best way to create this form Is there a gem or something else that exists to easily make this Can you do this with formtastic or even without a gem Thank you for any help.p

The task is supposed to import a CSV file and save it into the extensions database fields. p  pBut how do I tell the scheduler task to use the extensions model etc. and save the received data into the persistence layerp  pIve seen this answer to a similar question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21197709executerepositoryfunctionsinschedulertaskExecute repository functions in scheduler taska and I think it points the right way, but I think need a full example to start understanding how the dependency injection works.p
Negative 82227 pI can calculate the date for a single input, but when there is more inputs, how do I do thatbr One setfield has a name, DOB and AGE, AGE has to be calculated based on the DOB selected... the thig is that the user can add more setfield with the same inputsbrp  precodeltformgt ltdiv ngcontrollerdatasgt  ltdiv ngrepeatdatagt   ltinput nametext namenames[index][name]gt   ltinput classformcontrol         namedobs[index][dob]        typetext        iddobs[index][dob]gt   ltinput nameages[index][age] typetextgt  ltdivgt ltdivgt ltformgt codepre  pIm using angular to repeat that block of inputs encase the user need more... but the thing is, how do I calculate the age... if there was only 1 ID then no problem, now if I use class, and the user add 6 blocks the class would be the same, and every single input in that block age will get the same age even if the date is different... p  pthank you.p
Negative 82227 pAs we know, a cookie with Secure attribute means that it just transmitted via a encrypted connection. so my question is if a cookie can be a security one and a not security one. if so, why or for what p
Negative 82227 pI have some practice questions for Java here. We are supposed to determine the answer without using a compiler. p  pRefer to the following methodp  precodepublic static int  productint n if n lt 1     return 1 else      return n  productn2  codepre  pWhat is the output when product6 is calledp  pA 1p  pB 8p  pC 12p  pD 48p  pE 70p  pAccording to the answers, the correct output is 48. I dont really understand why this is true.  6 doesnt meet the base case, so it goes to the else statement.  So 6, then product62  product4, which goes to product2, which goes to product0 so that produces 6  4, 4  2, 2  0, 0  0.  But thats 32, not 48 Is there something Im missingp  pproduct25 returns 1181211311 for some reason, and Im not really sure why this happens either. Is it because theres a stack overflow in the recursive calls or somethingp  pExplanations would be extremely helpful, thank youp

Negative 82227 pI wrote an import script that has grown into a full import environment.p  pBasicaly I can run 3 different imports by executing thor tasks.p  pI set up a capistrano3 deploy script to transfer all of this a server. After deployment codecapistranowhenevercode will generate a crontab file to execute the import tasks at various times.p  pNow I ran into the problem, that I need a different ruby version for one of the imports MRI instead of JRuby.p  pI am currently using rbenv I dont want to switch to rvm. I thought that the easiest way would be to deploy to 2 directories e.g. srvrubyappmri and srvrubyappjruby and defining the ruby versions as roles i also need staging and production environment.p  pI already took a look at capistranomulticonfig but I cannot wrap my head around it.p  pSomeone did something similar or hash experience on how to do thatp

Negative 82227 pAs the title states, Im trying to count the number of matches within the last 100 records in a certain table. p  pThis query works, but the data is very dynamic, with lots of inserts on that particular table, and similar queries are being run, and they all end up being extremely slow 20s probably blocking each other out.p  pBecause caching the result is not acceptable data has to be live Im thinking of switching the exterior query to a PHP, even though I know that would be slower because it would still be faster than 20s.p  pHeres the queryp  precodeSELECT count as matches FROM    SELECT firstname FROM customers   WHERE division  somedivision   AND type  employee   ORDER BY requesttime DESC   LIMIT 0, 100  as entries WHERE firstname  somefirstnamehere codepre  pWhat Im looking for a more optimized way of performing the same task, without having to implement it in PHP since thats the naiveobviously wrong approach.p  pthe table looks something like thisp  precodeid firstname lastname type division requesttime codepre  pJust to set things straight, this is obviously not the actual table  data due to NDA reasons, but, the table looks exactly the same with different column names.p  pSo again, what Im trying to achieve is to pull a count of matches found WITHIN the last 100 records which have some contraints.p  pfor example, p  precodehow many times does the name John appear within the last 100 employees added in the HR division codepre

Negative 82227 pI have the need to make a control that allows for multi directional scrolling, but only for specific elements within the scollviewer.  p  pSomething like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comccbp8.png altMulti directional scrolling The control is split into 4 parts.p  pTop left is a static header, it will not move when scrolling.

Negative 82227 pI have an application where I have some other signal referenced to the system clock  codetime.timecode and I would like to record the audio input and figure out when it happened relative to the other signal.p  pAt first I tried using the callback API, thinking that they would occur right when the data was available from the sound card.    You would expect the callbacks to occur regularly with a difference of roughly the sample period  number of samples, but a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23214614timebetweencallbackcallsas other have noted, this isnt the case.ap  pI also tried the blocking API, thinking perhaps it would return when the data was first available, but that seems to have the same problems. There is also the concept of the adc clock in codeportaudiocode, which in callback mode gives codecurrenttimecode and codeinputbufferadctimecode relative to some other clock, which would probably provide the information I need.  But both of those values are usually zero Ubuntu 14 with the default microphone input from my motherboard, not sure which lower level API it is using, and one of them is occasionally nonzero.p  pIm willing to use codeportaudiocode directly if this cant be achieved in codepyaudiocode, but regardless I just need to be able to figure out when a sample not specific sample, any will do happened in codetime.timecode units posix epoch time to 100 microseconds or better. It seems like codepyaudiocode hides a lot the options from codeportaudiocode.p  pI should also note that there are two components to this timing. Im mostly interested in the long term component, such that if I record one event, and then another event an hour later, I know how far apart those two events were according to the system clock.  There is also probably a short term latency effect such that the system time I get will consistently be 1 ms after the actual event.  I can measure that latency directly once I get the long term part working.p  pedit a hrefhttpwww.portaudio.comdocsportaudiosyncacmc2003.pdf relnofollowI found this paper which discusses this problem.a  It sounds like the codecurrenttimecode and codeinputbufferadctimecode are the preferred way of doing this, so maybe the thing I should work on is figuring out how to use a different underlying API that actually has this information workingp

Negative 82227 pI have a page that displays a bunch of thumbnails of images that are retrieved using http. I use ngrepeat to go through the array and generate the html. This works fine. I also create a custom directive that I tie as an attribute to img elements generated by ngrepeat. This also works fine. However, when I try to pass data to the scope of my custom directive then it all falls apart. Data binding fails, ngrepeat does not replace the url of the images so I end up getting a 404 since the url is invalid. That is pretty much as far as it goes. Any help is greatly appreciated since I am completely new to Angular.p  pmy html templatep  precodeltdiv classportfolioContentgt ltdiv classrowgt     ltdiv classcollg3 colmd4 colsm4 colxs6 colpadding ngrepeatgImg in gPhotosgt         ltdiv classphotoframegt                 ltimg srcgImg.thumbnailUrl urlgImg.imageUrl imagegallerygt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt codepre  pp  pand my custom directivep  precodemyApp.directiveimageGallery,function  return      restrict A,     scope        url      ,     controller functionscope         console.logscope.url       codepre  pp

Negative 82227 pDoes the DigitalOcean control panel offer a way to delete a backup that has been made for a deleted droplet  NB backup, not snapshotp  pI created a droplet, enabling backups, and deleted it only a few minutes later.  DigitalOcean made a backup of the droplet just before completing the deletion.  So now I have a backup with no corresponding droplet.  Im being charged for the backup, and would like to delete it.p  pADDENDUM  The control panel offers an option to convert the backup to a snapshot.  When I did that, the backup disappeared, but it reappeared a short time later, after I had deleted the snapshot.  This left me right back where I started from.p  pThank you.p

Negative 82227 pImagine a case to search a very big file that contain 1000 sequences of A, B, C, D, E. Pls note that AE are in order and it never happens that E comes before A. I can use four basic RegExp statements to match 1000 times each A, each B, each C, each D, or E ending up 5 times reading the entire file from first to last. But, it makes lot of overhead and should be inefficient. I need to be able to read the entire file only once.For each of 1000 set of A,B,C,D,E I want to first find A, then continue reading the file to match B, C, D and E then again A, B, C, D, E ending up all searches in 1 time only.p  pPlease note that pattern for A, B, C, D or E are different and should not be mixed. We cannot use same pattern for all. Suppose pattern for finding A is Jac., for B is d, for C is [ds] and so on.p  pLet me give an example. Imagine a text file consists of information of 1000 participants in a study. p  ptext  My name is A. I am B years old. I am studying in class C, I am from D.

Negative 82227 pMy website has some serious issues when you resize it to the medium and small views. It looks great at full screen and mobile view but has some serious issues in the browser when you shrink it down to medium and below. Ive used foundation but also mixed in some nonfoundation code that I think is causing some issues, such as the container.

There is a lot of code to look at but i will post some snippets here as well as link to the main site so you can look through the full code. p  pHere is some of the top bar and also I have a container which is not part of the grid which might be throwing things off, as well as a weird header element that I coded some css for and if removed throws it off as well.

Negative 82227 pIm doing stress test on Cassandra. And I learn that using strongring cachestrong can improve the performance because the client requests can directly go to the target Cassandra server and the coordinator Cassandra node is the desired target node.

Seems that theres no performance improvement after using ring cache.

Negative 82227 pThe motivation for this question is a farfetched dream I have where a lot of the excellent software available on nix platforms could be trivially ported to Windows.  Microsoft has taken a different approach to open source and openness in general recently, so Id really like to know how viable such a thing would be if Microsoft were so inclined.  Some of the more specific things Im curious about is if it could be done without breaking backwards compatibility, and perhaps some sort of gauge on the amount of effort that would be involved.  If there were any specific technical examples that would highlight particular difficulties in doing such a thing, that would also be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 82227 pI need to replicate a feature of Android in iOS. The scenario is this, if you have a latest android version device then drag few app icons on the home screen and then try to bring one Widget icon onto the same home screen. Now when you try to rearrange the icons, you can see the icons moving around the Grid view, a light color pixel hint also being visible showing where the icon should fit if the finger lifted and all the animation and dynamic position calculation.

And yes I believe I cannot use UICollectionView as the layout is random not a pattern, the user can rearrange the tiles as he wish. And yes if one tile is dragged onto the other than both of them has to switch places. One layout condition is they should have 20 pixels distance from any other Tile.p  pAny help would be appreciated. There are lot of tutorials available if the Tile size is uniform but in my case there two different sized tiles available which increases the difficulty. Thank you. Happy coding.p
Negative 82227 pUPDATE codeclEnqueueReadBuffercommandqueue, cmemobj, CLTRUE, 0, LISTSIZE  sizeofdouble, C, 0, NULL, NULLcode is returning 5, codeCLOUTOFRESOURCEScode. This funcitoncall should never return thisp  pIve started using OpenCL and have come across a problem. If I allow a for loop in the kernel to run 10000 times I get all of C to be 0 if I allow the loop to run for 8000 the results are all correct.p  pI have added waits around the kernel to ensure it completes, thinking I was pulling the data out before completion and have tried both Clwaitforevent and CLFinish. No errors are signalled by any of the calls. I when I used ints the for loop would work at a size of 4000000. Float and doubles have the same problem however floats work at 10000, but not at 20000, when I used the floats I removed codepragma OPENCL EXTENSION clkhrfp64  enablecode to check that wasnt the problem.p  pIs this some weird memory thing, Im I using OpenCL wrong I realise that in most kernels I wount be implementing for loops like this, but this seems like an issue. I have also removed codeprivatecode to see if that was the problem, no change. So is there a limit on the size of for loops in OpenCL kernels Is is hardware specific Or is this a bugp  pThe kernel is a simple kernel, which adds 2 arrays AB together and outputs another C. In order to get a feel for performance I put a for loop around each calculation to slow it upincrease the number of operations per run through.p  pThe code for the kernel is as followsp  precodepragma

Negative 82227 pValgrind reports multiple memory leaks in my program, some of which are recurring leaks i.e. they occur in multiple blocks, but most of which are onetimers, i.e. allocations that happen at program initialization and that I dont care to take care of before the program exits. I know I can write suppression files to suppress leaks from specific libraries, functions etc., but I havent found a way to suppress leaks a limited number of times. Is there a way of doing thisp  pCurrently, I use a small program I wrote to filter Valgrinds report file from onetime leaks so when a paragraph in the report file starts with codeX bytes leaked in 1 blockscode, that paragraph is removed from the report file, but obviously Id prefer to configure Valgrind to suppress these leaks instead, not least because my filter does nothing to keep the leak summary accurate.p

Negative 82227 pIt is well known that usual Akka actors provide atmostonce delivery semantics.

This transactions are modelled  internally as specific message flows between the actors that compose the system potentially deployed in multiple machines. p  pSo, if the lost of a single message in the aforementioned message flows implies that the transaction fails or it is silently discarded, does this situation forces the implementation to use atleastonce delivery with all the boilerplate EVERYWHERE Wouldnt this make the code base kind of cumbersome to maintain How to handle this kind of situations efficiently in terms of the balance of code maintainability and overall system performance How to minimize in general the use of atleastonce delivery in a safe wayp  pThanks a lot.p

Negative 82227 pBACKGROUND My company is acting as the SP to our clients that are the IDP. We use OpenAM, but our clients use ADFS or Shibboleth. We exchange metadata files for establishing federations, not URLS. A client asked why we require an AuthnContext class schema specifically PasswordProtectedTransport, and not only do we not know why, we dont know how to change it or what that would mean.p  pQUESTION What is the functional difference between using PasswordProtectedTransport vs unspecified for the AuthnContextClassRef in a SAML2 assertion p  pWe currently use PasswordProtectedTransport amongst all our clients, but no one at my company can tell me why we require this. If we remove it, the federation stops working with a 500 errror and a NoAuthnContext in the SAML trace. We also dont understand that, as I was led to believe from saml documentation that having a schema is optional for the authentication. Even so, I saw no explanation anywhere of what the implications of using unspecified would be.p  pI cant find any thorough explanation or discussion anywhere about this topic and was hoping someone could elaborate for me, as I am struggling to find light on this.p

Negative 82227 pI have 3 questions I would like to ask as I am relatively new to both R and Json format. I read quite a bit of things but I dont quite understand still.  p  p1 Can R parse Json data when the txt file contains other irrelevant information as well p  pAssuming I cant, I uploaded the text file into R and did some cleaning up. So that it will be easier to read the file. p  precoderequireplyr requirerjson  small.f.2 lt subsetsmall.f.1,  V1 in cLevelIndex, FeatureType, Goals, MoveCount small.f.3 lt small.f.2[,1] codepre  pThis would give me a single column with all the json data in each line.  I tried to write new .txt file .p  precodewrite.tablesmall.f.3, filesmall clean.txt,  row.names  FALSE jsondata lt fromJSONfilesmall.clean codepre  pThe problem was it only converted x first row into a character and ignored everything else. I imagined it was the problem with x so I took that out from the .txt file and ran it again. p  precodejsondata lt fromJSONfilesmall clean copy.txt   small lt fromJSONpastereadLinessmall clean copy.txt, collapse codepre  pBoth time worked and I manage to create a list. But it only takes the data from the first row and ignore the rest. This leads to my second question. p  pI tried this.. p  precodesmall lt fromJSONpastereadLinessmall clean copy.txt, collapse, Error in fromJSONpastereadLinessmall clean copy.txt, collapse   ,     unexpected character , codepre  p2. How can I extract the rest of the rows in the .txt file p  p3. Is it possible for R to read the Json data from one row, and extract only the nested data that I need, and subsequently go on to the next row, like a loop For example, in each array, I am only interested in the Action vectors and the State Feature vectors, but I am not interested in the rest of the data.  If I can somehow extract only the information I need before moving on to the next array, than I can save a lot of memory space. p  pI validated the array online. But the .txt file is not json formatted. Only within each array. I hope this make sense. Each row is a nested array. p  pThe data looks something like this. I have about 65 rows nested arrays in total.p  precodeNonlightningIndices[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15],LightningIndices[],SelectedAction12,StateFeaturesData[21.0,58.0,0.599999964237213,12.0,9.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],Actions[FeaturesData[4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12213890532609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.13055793241076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.231325346416068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.949158357257511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.369666537828737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0851765937900996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.223409208023677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.698640447815897,1.69496718435102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.42312654023416,0.0,0.38394999584831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.22164326251584,1.30980246401454,1.00411570750454,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.44306759429513,0.0,0.00568191150434618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.157705869690127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.102089274086033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37039305683305,2.64354332879095,0.0,0.456876463171171,0.0,0.0,0.208651305680117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,3.46713142511126,2.26785558685153,0.284845692694476,0.29200364444299,0.0,0.562185300773834,1.79134869431988,0.423426746571872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.06772310533214,0.0,1.95593334724537,2.08448537685298,1.22045520912269,0.251119892385839,0.0,4.86192274732091,0.0,0.186941346075472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.37998688020614,0.0,3.04406665275463,1.0,0.49469909818283,0.0,0.0,1.57589195190525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.55229001446173],......

Negative 82227 pBeing a newbie in Nodejs, I jumped right into writing a simple app without really reading up on good security practices. I just found out that using codebodyParsercode for all routes is actually a hrefhttpandrewkelley.mepostdonotusebodyparserwithexpressjs.html relnofollowa bad thing because it allows for DOS attack using multipart filesa.p  pA recommended fix is to only load specific modules depending on the route. ie, for multipart fileupload, use codemultipartcode. For regular POST without file uploads ie, text form submission, use codeexpress.json, express.urlencodedcode.p  pOr another option is to use a hrefhttpsgithub.commscdexbusboy relnofollowbusboya with a hrefhttpsgithub.commscdexconnectbusboy relnofollowconnectbusboya. But the thing Im confused on is how I can specify which route should handle multipart data and which should not Otherwise, wouldnt I have the same problem as with codebodyParsercode p  pFurthermore, codebusboycode docs says it does not handle codeGETcodep  precodeIf you find that req.busboy is not defined in your code when you expect it to be, check that the following conditions are met. If they are not, req.busboy wont be defined   1. The request method is not GET or HEAD codepre  pSo, Im even more confused how I would parse codeparamscode in a codeGETcode. I think codebodyParsercode does this for me so I could access data with codereq.paramscode.p  pFor example, how would I migrate away from codebodyParsercode to codebusboyconnectbusboycode with this simple appp  precodevar express  requireexpress var app  express var http  requirehttp.Serverapp  var bodyParser  requirebodyparser app.usebodyParser.json  var busboy  requireconnectbusboy app.usebusboy   How to use busboy to prevent multipart files here app.postformdatanofileupload, functionreq, res      var somedata  req.body.somedata    Use busboy to handle both regular form data  fileuploads  app.postformdataANDfileupload, functionreq, res      What would handle GET without bodyparser app.getgetsomething, functionreq, res      var params  req.params   http.listen3000, function  codepre

Negative 82227 pSo this is a pretty straightforward question but the solution seems not so straightforward to a twig beginner like myself. Basically, I want to apply some javascript to a set of forms, so I need the field ids to remain the same across those different forms or to somehow inject these ids into the javascript file which Im not sure how to do if it is external.p  pI use this to render the textarea widgetp  precode formwidgetform.text  codepre  pWhich automatically gives it an id that I want to change. Doing thisp  precode formwidgetform.text, attr id ootnblogbundleentrytext  codepre  pjust adds another id to the field and since there are now two of them, the second one mine is simply ignored.p  pHow do I tell formwidget to give the textarea a different idp

Negative 82227 pI have inserted a textbox into a row range. The purpose of the textbox is to allow for more dynamic formating of input text than is available by just entering text into a cell.  I would like the textbox to be expandable, which is easily done in the text box settings, and have the corresponding row expand along with it which is not so easy.  I have cells with data below the text box and when it expands now it covers those cells.p  pI would appreciate any assistence with vba code that would allow the row height to automatically adjust as the text box height adjusts.  I have searched online and while I found 1 similar question but the answer given suggested using a user form textbox that feeds to a cell but that does not meet my formatting needs.  Also just to be clear, this is the text box that is found from the insert menu in Excel.  p  pI imagine the code would look something likep  precodeOn change event linked to textbox not sure if this is possible dim x as long, commentcellrng as range set commentcellrng as thisworkbook.sheetsSheet1.rangeA81N81     x  textbox  height Not sure how to return textbox height also I dont know if text box height matches cell height unit of measure commentcellrng.entirerow.height  x codepre  pI am not sure if I am going in the right direction but hope this outlines what I want to happen. p

Negative 82227 pFF 38 on Mac, Linux, and Windows. p  pI am talking about h.264 mp4s throughout this question.p  pWe have a content curation app one where users upload multimedia to s3, transcode the file using elastic transcoder and playback the transcoded version. Using this workflow, every file behaves as expected.p  pWe recently added a feature to allow users to add already transcoded using any variety of services, handbrake for example files directly to s3, and play them back in the browser. This works as expected in Chrome. p  pHowever, in Firefox, the videos take minutes to begin playback at all, then struggle to continue streaming. We have seen this behavior in files as small as 200mb and up to 600mb.p  pWe use jwplayer for playback.p  pSometimes, and I stress sometimes, after clicking play, we see a 416 http error code where the browser has requested the last byte of the file. I can refresh the page several times, and might see it, but might not. If I come back to the same file in 10 minutes, the error may be gone, but the file still does not playback correctly.p  pWe do see, for each 206 part request, a SHA1 warning for the SSL cert. p  pChrome seems to make one request with range header set to 0, another request for bytes towards the end of the file, and then a couple part requests. It immediately begins playback after. Firefox if it is not getting the 416 does similar, but instead will request upwards of 8 parts and then hang.p  pFinally, Firefox blocks upload of these files using our standard uploader as well. I get a 403 Forbidden on the initial POST request.p  pThese files are not corrupt, as far as I can tell, as they playback fine locally, and in Chrome. Chrome also allows the upload of the files. I should also mention that I can download the file from S3 and playback works locally.p  pI will provide whatever other diagnostic information you might need.p  pAre there any known issues that we have missed in our googlingbug hunting Any other avenues we can go down Any ideas on how to improve playback p

Negative 82227 pIm kinda struggling with the Apache commonscli v1.3 and I havent found a practical solution to the following problem yetp  pI have a command line tool that  depending on the specified parameters  creates a String or reads it from a local file, possible edits it inline, and optionally displays, writes said String to a local file or sends it via an HTTP request to a server.p  pSo I have the options c for create, r for read, e for edit via the cli, d for display, w for write, and p for push to serverp  pObviously some combinations are possible. E.g. it should be possible to create this String and push it without reading or writing it fromto a file. Also, it should be possible to create and write without pushing, and so on...p  pSo the semantics of the parameters arep  precodec OR r [e] [d w p] codepre  pObviously, when the String is created, it must not be read. When creating, id use interactive input from a cliparser. When reading, I want to allow the user to edit via interactive input from the cli. The rest of the parameters are kinda optional.p  pNext When reading, a filenamepath needs to be specified. Also, when writing, this is necessary. Anyhow, it should be possible to specify a file to read from and a SECOND file to write to. So there would be two arguments for filenames, which are both optional.p  pThe resulting syntax would look like thisp  precodetool cp tool rp filenametoread tool rdwp filenametoread filenametowrite tool cw filenametowrite codepre  pand so on.p  pIm a bit lost here. How to I configure commonscli to have two arguments for filenames, which are required based on the parameters options specified Is this even possiblep

Negative 82227 pI need to conduct the seemingly simple task of stacking 3 files next to each other. They are all the same .avi Container, 320x240, 43, 25 fps, GeoVision Advanced MPEG4 GEO codec. I installed the GeoVision codec a hrefhttpwww.geovision.com.twenglish58.asp relnofollowhttpwww.geovision.com.twenglish58.aspa  select other utilities, so my system windows media player, media player classic can play back the files. Also, I can open and work with them in Virtual Dub. I installed AviSynth and wrote the simple script for stacking them next to each otherp  precodeh1  AVISourceEvent20150423075842001.avi  h2  AVISourceEvent20150423075842002.avi  h3  AVISourceEvent20150423075848003.avi  StackHorizontalh1, h2, h3 codepre  pnow, when I save it as .avs and then open it using VirtualDub, I see three videos nicely put next to each other, but the colors are weird and parts of the video are upside down and everything is just ..wrong  see Screenshot a hrefhttpwww.linkfile.dedownload46f71057ed130f9be29510f68ce4ee71.php relnofollowhttpwww.linkfile.dedownload46f71057ed130f9be29510f68ce4ee71.phpa. First I thought it has something to do with avisynth taking the wrong codec, so i forced it on gmp4 as you can also see in the screenshot, but the result is the same. I have now also Avisynth installed, as well as VirtualDubMod.  When I open the .avs in VDMod, I get couldnt locate decompressor for format YV24, but it still opens the video which emlooksem a little better though but when I make a direct stream copy and save it, then play it back in MPC it looks exactly the same as it looked on the first screenshot. So this error points me toward something related to the colorspace.  Now my questionsp  ul liHow can I find out in which format my files are YUV24, YUV12, .. li liAnd then, how can I tell Avisynth to use a format that VirtualDubMod can deal with li liOr how can I make VirtualDub deal with YUV24 Am I just missing a codec Is my train of thought even slightly on the right track, or is my problem something totally differentli ul  pI also found this related thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10573951editingdecodingavifilesusingsysteminstalledproprietarycodecsEditingDecoding AVI files using systeminstalled proprietary codecsa, but using avisynth and ffmpeg, I get similar results as with VirtualDub.p  pI cant use the solution of converting all my files first and then do the stacking in a second step  because the actual files I have to work with are about 180 videos, each like 8hours long and the time it would consume would stand in no relation to my possibilities..p  pI really have looked for solutions during the past week, and I think Im close, but I sadly just dont know enough about programming to be able to solve it on my own.. so I also want to excuse for any apparent stupidities in my explanation  Im very thankfull for any helpp  pHave a good time everybodyp  pEDIT So I have some more Info, and an example file, which I cant link in this post . because I again have not enough reputation, very nice.

I want to enable the JSON schema part only if a schema exists. Thus, I began introducing a codestructcode like sop  precode template ltclass Serializablegt  struct JsonSchema    template ltgt  struct JsonSchemaltMySerializingClassgt         static const char schemaURI[]  ...   codepre  pIve not finished the approach because I am unsure how to realize the followingp  ol liThe schemachecking code in codefromJSONcode should only be compiled if a template specialization of the codeJsonSchemacode struct exists.li liIf this struct exist, Id like the compiler to check if a codeschemaURIcode field exists and whether its size is 0. If not, Id like to give the programmer a descriptive error message like I can do with codeBOOSTSTATICASSERTcode.li ol  pIs that possible The API is not finalized the most important part here is that the checks should happen at compile time. The codeschemaURIcode parameter is set by the programmer, and does not change at runtime  the schema file is part of the distributed program and administered via a resource system, so it is guaranteed to be available if the program compiles.p

Negative 82227 pOk, this is the problemp  pI have a search form where I have several input fields to specify a search request.

Isnt there a better way to do all this Like having a URL representation which is independent of the actual logicp  pFurthermore, is there even a clean solution to use all the benefits of symfony form without actual request parameters but with that request slug.p  pThanksp

Negative 82227 pHow to extract mantissa, exponent and sign data from an IEEE754 64bit double floatingpoint number in VBA  Thanks  p  pstrongEditstrong after John Coleman comments. Before posting the original question, I have looked around for a solution and could only find how to do it in C e.g. using structures with bit fields.  Couldnt find anything for VBA.  I have tried using VBAs bit operators i.e. AND, OR, NOT, XOR but this does not seem to give the expected result.  For example, 1 expressed in single precision IEEE 32bit floatingpoint is represented byp  h20 01111111 00000000000000000000000h2  pwhere the first bit is for sign, the next 8 bits are for the biased exponent, and the last 23 bits are for the mantissa.  Applying NOT to 1 should return p  h21 10000000 11111111111111111111111h2  pwhich is 3.9999998 in decimal, but the following code in VBA returns 2, which is represented byp  h21 10000000 00000000000000000000000h2  precodex  Not 1 Debug.Print x codepre  pI didnt see the point of posting this in my OP.p

Negative 82227 pSo something interesting is happening  unfortunately, I cannot post a url or something you guys can access, so maybe someone just has an idea of what the cause could be.  Id assume it would be something in development.  Either way...p  pI have a test that logs in to an application, which will then load up a dashboard and search for some data.  In Firefox, everything works fine.  However, IE11 is having an issue once it logs in.  So, Selenium works fine up until it loads the dashboard, where it will then find NOTHING.  Not even html.  It gives the basic element not found error.  Im assuming the developers have written something that prevents access, but the one I talked to wasnt sure.  p  pAny idea of what could be causing this so that I could go suggest something to the developers  Again, this doesnt happen in Firefox, which could also suggest somethings up with IE11 though Selenium works fine on other applications and up until the Dashboard screen on this one.  If you need more information, let me know  just be aware that I might not have much to give.p  pA couple things to notep  precode1.  it is https protocol, but so is the login page 2.  at the end of the url bar, it says there is a certificate error that will not go away  no matter what I do I have added the supposedly correct certificates. codepre  pWhat Im usingp  precodeSelenium 2.4.5 32 bit IEDriverServer Python 2.7.8 IE11 other IE versions are not supported, so I cannot compare Windows 7 codepre  pEDITp  pI talked with a developer, and the best thing he could think of was the fact that the dashboard heavily uses polyfills, and that maybe that is the reason that Selenium isnt finding anything.  With that being said, is there a way to find elements using Selenium when polyfills are involved  Or is Selenium just not going to work for it.p  pMOREp  pHere is some code that equivalent to what my test would do.

Negative 82227 pCurrently we have a website called sitename.domain.com. For many reasons that will not be mentioned we implemented IE 11 and now we found an issue with some users typing a hrefhttpsitename relnofollowhttpsitenamea instead of a hrefhttpsitename.domain.com relnofollowhttpsitename.domain.coma . While this should be fine, what is happening is that when they go to the site the saddress bar says a hrefhttpsitename relnofollowhttpsitenamea, we need it to say a hrefhttpsitename.domain.com relnofollowhttpsitename.domain.coma . Now this is an internal website, how can we force the full name. When we pint the sitename it shows the full name sitename.domain.com yet in the browser address bar when we type a hrefhttpsitename relnofollowhttpsitenamea it just goes to sitename not sitename.domain.com .

Negative 82227 pIm developing a simple REST application that leverages on RxJava to send requests to a remote server 1. For each incoming request to the REST API a request is sent using RxJava and RxNetty to 1. Everything is working fine but now I have a new use casep  pIn order to not bombard 1 with too many request I need to implement rate limiting. One way to solve this I assume would be to add each codeObservablecode created when sending a request to 1 into another codeObservablecode 2 that does the actual ratelimiting. 2 will then act more or less like a queue and process the outbound requests as fast as possible but not faster than the rate limit.

Negative 82227 pI have a pure JS app that produces PDFs hosted in an Android web view. Generated PDFs are then sent to a digital signature component a sealed external component, I have no control on the component I give it a PDF, it capture some biometric data and returns the PDF signed. The component expect a PDFA compliant file, but file generated from pdfmake, except for font embedding, it is not. p  pcodeThe file trailer dictionary must have an id key. The key Metadata is required but missing. The key MarkInfo is required but missing. A devicespecific color space DeviceRGB without an appropriate output intent is used. The document does not conform to the requested standard. The document contains devicespecific color spaces. The documents meta data is either missing or inconsistent or corrupt. The document doesnt provide appropriate logical structure information. codep  pI read the documentation of pdfmake and pdfkit, that pdfmake refers and found no easy way to embed in the output PDF the needed data to make the file PDFA compliant. p  pSo, is there a somewhat easy way to have a PDFA file out of pdfmakepdfkit or another pure JS component or Ill have to heavily modify those libraries p  pI have a fallback solution I could use iText on Android to render the file PDFA compliant, but it is really the last thing I would do.p
