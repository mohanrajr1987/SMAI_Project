Positive 3626 pUsing MS SQL Server. I have to build a view with columns from two entities that have a onetomany relationship. The primary entity is Performance Reports. The table should have one performance report per row. p  pThe related entity is Performance Report Logs. Each record includes one Problem and an unlimited number of Inputs. This structure was chosen in order to be able to link certain problems with certain inputs, rather than just having a list of all problems and all inputs in the Performance Report entity itself. Each Performance Report Log is linked to a Performance Report via lookup.p  pI would like the view to have the columns from the main Performance Report entity, followed by the columns from all related Performance Report Logs. So, if a Performance Report has three Logs, the columns from all three logs should be included in the same row, rather than three rows. They should also be in separate columns, not merged into one as in groupconcat.p  pThank youp

Negative 3626 pIm trying to program a pyramid like score system for an ARG game and have come up with a problem. When users get into the game they start a new pyramid but if one start the game with a referer code from another player they become a child of this user and then kick points up the ladder.p  pThe issue here is not the point calculation, Ive gotten that right with some good help from you guys, but if a user gets more point that it parent, they should switch places in the ladder. So that a users parent becomes its child and so on.p  pThe python code I have now doesnt work proper, and I dont really know why.p  precodedef verifyparentsuser          This is a recursive function that checks to see if any of the parents     should bump up because they got more points than its parent.           from rottenetter.accounts.models import getscore      try         parent  user.parent     except         return False     else          If this players score is greater than its parent         if getscoreuser gt getscoreparent              change parent             user.parent  parent.parent             user.save               change parents parent to current profile             parent.parent  user             parent.save         verifyparentsparent codepre  pIn my mind this should work, if a user has a parent, check to see if the user got more points than its parent, if so, set the users parent to be the parents parent, and set the parents parent to be the user, and then they have switched places. And after that, call the same function with the parent as a target so that it can check it self, and then continue up the ladder.p  pBut this doesnt always work, in some cases people arent bumbed to the right position of some reason.p  pEditp  pWhen one users steps up or down a step in the ladder, its childs move with him so they still relate to the same parent, unless they to get more points and step up. So it should be unecessary to anything with the parents shouldnt itp

They both show the same behaviour. In a view, we have lots of libraries that are used for build but are strictly readonly. The CI system executes cleartool lshistory and finds a change in the VCS.

Why wouldnt it update only the changed elements, which were previously obtained by cleartool lshistory Is there a CI system that can do thisp

Negative 3626 pI am having a web application built using ASP and Asp.Net.I want to restrict number of users accessing this website.There are ways available separately ASP and ASP.NEt but,not for combination of these two.

Negative 3626 pIm trying to build a system using jqgrid which does everything on the clientside, i.e. use AJAX to retrieve a JSON object using C.Net and cache this in a javascript variable and then populate several grids from that cache addRowData, depending on the data. Thats all working very well.p  pHowever, Im having problems discovering how to do some of the more advanced things now.p  p1 pagingsorting the data with no server interaction. Is this possible Or does it require that I write custom paging functions i.e. when the user moves to page 2, get the next 10 records from the cache and update the grid with them. Hopefully theres an automatic way to do this How about sorting Read some things that suggest its done server side but maybe they were old articles Not sure.p  p2 Allow the users to see controls mainly radio buttons and datepicker on each row and have those changes reflected in the cache variable. I looked at the editing functions of jqGrid but this seems to be clickeditsave. Ideally Id like the grids initial display to show, for example, one of the columns displaying pairs of radio buttons on every row and the user can just click the ones they are interested in i.e. they dont have to explicitly edit the row to seechange the radio buttons. This data is updated in the grid and, more importantly, in the cache variable driving the grid. Is there an automatic way of tying controls on each row to an underlying client dataset How do I create the controls in each cell and relate their value to the cell valuep  pHoepfully someone could point me in the right directionp  pThanks for any help you can give,p  pBillp

Negative 3626 pI decided to try project euler problem 17 today, and I quickly wrote a pretty fast code in C to solve it. However, for some reason, the result is wrong. The question isp  pIf the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3  3  5  4  4  19 letters used in total.p  pIf all the numbers from 1 to 1000 one thousand inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be usedp  pNOTE Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 three hundred and fortytwo contains 23 letters and 115 one hundred and fifteen contains 20 letters. The use of and when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.p  pI seriously dont know why, as I have checked every part of my program thoroughly and I cant find anything wrong. The only thing bad I could find is when checking for 1000, my while loop doesnt check correctly. I fixed that by lowering the limit of my while loop to lt1000 instead of lt1001 and just added 11onethousand  11 manually to the sum. And yet, it doesnt work.

Negative 3626 pIm porting a program from turbogears to web.pymodwsgi with pretty good success.  Ive setup the URL handling similar to turbogears, but Im running into a minor annoyance in how extjs 2.0 handles URLs.  p  pSay my app is named ack, I can test it by going to either a hrefhttplocalhostack relnofollowhttplocalhostacka or a hrefhttplocalhostack relnofollowhttplocalhostacka note the trailing slash as the only difference.  From a web.py point of view, this doesnt matter.  However, in the template Im using that was written in extjs, I designate urls to query information from the app using JSON example below.  p  precodevar nameListStore  new Ext.data.JsonStore url nameList, root nameList, autoLoad true, fields [name],  codepre  pHeres the trouble.  If I access my app using the trailing slash, than extjs forms the a url query like a hrefhttplocalhostacknameList relnofollowhttplocalhostacknameLista, which calls my apps function and gets the correct data back.  If I dont have the trailing slash in the address bar, extjs builds the url as a hrefhttplocalhostnameList relnofollowhttplocalhostnameLista, which never makes it to my application and literally every JSON query fails as shown in my firebug console.  p  pI assume extjs is just ripping off anything trailing the last slash to build the url, but Id like to fix that.  Right now Im just telling my users to make sure they run the app with the trailing slash, but this seems like a simple thing to handle.  I just dont know how in extjs.  p

Negative 3626 pI am genuinely puzzled... but first, let me give you a rough overview.p  pIve done some restructuring in a database, by merging 4 tables into two. All tables have simple numeric sequences as primary keys. The tables were in fact in pairs very very similar. The only reason why they were split in two was based on historic data that had to be imported. Without this split, there would have been a lot of redundancy, and conceptually it made sense.p  pNow, after a good deal of work went into data cleansing, its now finally possible to merge them and simply use one of the fields as discriminator. To talk less abstract, the tables contain companies. And they are either local residents or not the two classes. They can easily be distinguished by their post code the discriminator field. These tables are slowly changing dimensions the sequence being the surrogate key. The other two tables contain the normal data attached to these SCDs. Hence, 4 tables. 2 for local companies, and 2 for nonlocals.p  pThese tables have now been simplified and merged, so I now only have codeCompanycode and codeCompanyDatacode.p  pTo be on the safe side, and not to lose any historic information I created the two new tables with new sequence fields. The old sequences are kept in case 10 years from now I realise something went wrong p  pSo far so good.p  pThe restructuring was fairly easy, reconnecting the correct entries was a nobrainer as well. Next, I needed to update the application which interfaces with this DB, which was a bit more work, but still easy. The application uses JPA using EclipseLink 2.0 on top of  as said already  a PostgreSQL 9.0 database.p  pAnd here comes the weird partp  pWhen I try to insert a new company, I get a duplicate key error, stating that the given ID exists already. But that should be handled by the sequence object... should it notp  pSo I did some digging around. I could verify that subsequent inerts indeed returned duplicate key errors with emincrementingem ids. This means, that the sequence logic is OK. The only problem is that the current value is too low. So a call to nextval or whatever JPA uses will return an ID which already exists.p  pI have the following in the JPAEntityp  precodeId GeneratedValuestrategy  GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator  enterpriseidseq Columnname  id, nullable  false private Integer id codepre  pAnd my sequence looks like thisp  precodetestdb d enterpriseidseq        Sequence public.enterpriseidseq     Column       Type           Value           sequencename  name     enterpriseidseq  lastvalue     bigint   19659  startvalue    bigint   1  incrementby   bigint   1  maxvalue      bigint   9223372036854775807  minvalue      bigint   1  cachevalue    bigint   1  logcnt        bigint   32  iscycled      boolean  f  iscalled      boolean  t codepre  pThe errors I get are thesep  precode[...]  Caused by Exception [EclipseLink4002] Eclipse Persistence Services  2.0.1.v20100213 r6600 org.eclipse.persistence.exceptions.DatabaseException Internal Exception org.postgresql.util.PSQLException ERROR duplicate key value violates unique constraint enterprisepkey     Detail Key id19611 already exists. Error Code 0 Call INSERT INTO en...  [...] codepre  pAs you can see, it tries to insert an entity with id code19611code, but the last value on the sequence is code19659code. Which is clearly wrong.p  pI also tried to restart the application server behind all this so to close all open connections ans sessions. No luck... Another thing I noticed The field is defined as codeIntegercode. Should it rather be codeLongcode That would necessitate quite some changes in the code, and I did not yet have time to fix this.p  pAs Im only 50 entries behind I could simply try to run the insert 50 times, but Id rather know exactly what went wrong...p  pWhat am I missing herep  pstrongUpdatestrong After some more digging, I came across a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comjavaee5apijavaxpersistenceSequenceGenerator.htmlallocationSize2829 relnofollowallocationSizea which has a default of 50. Interestingly, this comes quite close to the difference of IDs Im seeing. It may not be 100 the same due to some testing and frobnicating.

Negative 3626 pI have a strange scenario when my application can get into an infinite loop when shutting down. It occurs when it wants to do something but the calls fail as it no longer has access time based. In such a scenario it should just stop. I record failed attempts and if the count goes above a certain number in a certain time I throw an exception which I expect to start the JIT debugger and stop the application. I am not entirely sure why it gets into the loop so I want the JIT window that gives me information like the call stack and application status. I have exception handling, but what I want is to turn it off and somehow generate an exception that will trigger the JIT debugger, however, all other posts I have found have been for handling exceptions and avoid crashes. If there is another way at runtime to have the application stop and tell me what is happening I would like to know. Thanks.p

Negative 3626 pI recently updated an app with LINQ to SQL and SQL Server CE 3.5 to Entity Framework 4.1 Code First and SQL Server CE 4.0, and its now running noticeably slower. I did some before vs. after stopwatch testing, and most major operations of my app appear to be running about 40 slower on average.p  pIm using all default strategies and configurations for EF Code First except for disabling cascading deletes.p  pWhen I originally posted this question, I was focused on one query that seemed to be taking particularly long, but Ive since realized that it was only particularly slow on first run see the comment thread below.p  pWhat I now think Im seeing is that most queries are running slowernot dramatically slower, but slow enough to quickly add up as most operations the app performs involve several queries.p  pThis app has a very small database. The SQL CE .sdf file is only 458 KB, and the largest table has less than 250 records.p  pHeres an example POCO classp  precodepublic class Target      public int Id  get set      public int TrialDefinitionId  get set      public int Number  get set      public int X  get set      public int Y  get set      public string Phase  get set      public virtual TrialDefinition TrialDefinition  get set   codepre  pAll my classes follow this basic pattern simple types  virtual properties to obtain objects linked by foreign keys. I have one class that uses an codeICollectioncode to obtain a listing for a manytoone relationship.p  pFinal note Im using a repository pattern as a mediator, and each usage of a repository is placed in a codeusingcode block. For get operations, this results in entities becoming detached once Ive obtained the data I need from the database.p  pstrongDoes anyone have any specific strategies for improving the performance of my EF Code First appstrong Please keep in mind that I havent had a chance yet to read up on EF in much detail. Im mostly just trying to migrate as quickly and painlessly as possible from LINQ to SQL to EF. The most useful answer for me would be one that consists of changing specific strategies or configurations or other settings.p

It seems to me that the biggest chunk I can reasonably grab is 1,000 rows, so I wrote a script that would run the query over and over with a codeSELECT INTO OUTFILEcode, limit and offset. Then, at the end, I take all the CSV files I dumped and codecatcode them together. It works but its slow. It takes hours. I have the script running right now and its only dumped 43,000 rows in about an hour.p  pstrongShould I attack this problem at the query optimization level or does the long fetch time suggest I should focus elsewhere What would you recommend I dostrongp  pIf you want to see the query you can see it a hrefhttppastebin.comygDU09vr relnofollowherea.p

Negative 3626 pI have a jQueryUi Modal dialog up and running correctly based on an Asp.Net MVC3 partial view.  For all but one of the fields, pressing the CANCEL button does what is expected.  The button click handler function in the dialog options is called and dialog.close is called.  You can see it at a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netphototomYA87Y6 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netphototomYA87Y6a.  p  pWhen any field is for entry is clicked on, there is some JavaScript that runs that highlights the label and the input control by adding a css class tag to the table row that both are in. p  pLast Name field is different in that it is a textarea control with some events attached dynamically for displaying the number of reaming characters the user can enter.  Pressing the CANCEL button while this field has focus, initially causes the field to loose focus and the function on the CANCEL button function in the dialog options is not called.  The second time you press the CANCEL button, the dialog will close properly. p  pAny suggestions as to what the problem may be  p

Negative 3626 pI am working on a community website with thumbnails of slightly different sizes. p  pI have a div box set at 165x165 pixels. p  pSome full sized thumbnails images end up being 165 pixels, others 180, 192, 205, etc. p  pWhat Id like to do is always force these to display horizontally centered inside the div box at no wider than 165 pixels. Therefore should an image be 185 pixels horizontally it will crop off 10 pixels to the left and 10 pixels to the right. An image of 205 pixels horizontally would be cropped 20 pixels on each side. p  pUnfortunately I wont have access to server side code for this so it has to all be accomplished javascript andor jquery. p  pThe biggest challenge I see with this is that the image sizes are always changing.p
Negative 3626 pWe have two dedicated servers. Server 1 is running Linux CentOS and acts as our webserver. Server 2 is running Windows Server 2008 mostly hosting services such as gameservers and does not have apache or anything installed.p  pServer 1 is hosting the website minecraft.nl. We were also running our Minecraft server on Server 1. This way you could join our server by typing in minecraft.nl in the address bar ingame.p  pBecause of performance issues our Minecraft server is forced to move from Server 1 to Server 2. Problem is, that then cant join our server any more by typing in minecraft.nl which I think is a big plus when pulling in players. The only solution I see right now is making a subdomain like play.minecraft.nl and have that redirect to Server 2, but thats not exactly what I want.p  pSo is there a way to keep the game server and website on the same address minecraft.nl, but direct the connection to either Server 1 or Server 2 based on whether the website or game server is contactedp

Negative 3626 pJust to summarize, Im trying to make a live page render browse websites while having an overlaying menu for functionality.p  pI may have made a mistake in how I designed my application and need an alternative to frames. Any advice is appreciated on this.p  pSo the goal of the application is analyzing web content. Its got a global menu with the usual stuff profile, sign out, settings. A global footer with the standard legal stuff and in the middle is where all the functionality comes in. p  pI knew that one of the functionality was a live render of the site with a menu overlaying at the bottom. With it, they could view elements and write up comments on what was there.p  pEach function was embedded inside a frame so if i clicked the page view button, the frame would shoot off to the frame page and relay it. Heres the problem. In order to get a live render of a site and using it this way, I had to put a frame inside a frame and thus duplicate scroll bars were born.p  pIf anyones confused as to how the layout works there are 2 shots here. a hrefhttps1180.photobucket.comalbumsx4060vertoneactionviewampcurrentpageviewlayout.jpg relnofollowhttps1180.photobucket.comalbumsx4060vertoneactionviewampcurrentpageviewlayout.jpga And a cleaner designer model mainly just global menu a hrefhttps1180.photobucket.comalbumsx4060vertoneactionviewampcurrentglobalview.jpg relnofollowhttps1180.photobucket.comalbumsx4060vertoneactionviewampcurrentglobalview.jpgap  pIve got the coding it and for the overlaying menus, I tried both an accordion and a css style thing that slides.

Just looking now, on the page view at the bottom of live website but above the footer. There needs to be an overlaying menu that slides in an out. If anyone has any ideas on how to implement a live view of a site and an overlaying menu, Im all ears.p  pThank youp  hr  pQuick Summaryp  pWhat Im trying to achieve is an application that has a global menu that stays consistent across all pages. In the middle of this global menu is a frame that goes to other pages that Ive created, e.g list view, statistics and page view.p  pPage view is the one Im working on at the moment. In the page view there are 2 components, Live view of website whatever page they want and an overlaying menu at the bottom. Think like youtubes playlist on bottom of page. The problem is that in order to put this live render of a website in the frame, you have an iframe within an iframe and Im trying to resolve that. p  pBut rather than treat it as a bug, Im looking for alternatives to how I can achieve the abovep  hr  hr  hr  pMy final solution available on pastebin page view a hrefhttppaste.ubuntu.com648246 relnofollowhttppaste.ubuntu.com648246a p  pGlobal view a hrefhttppaste.ubuntu.com648250 relnofollowhttppaste.ubuntu.com648250ap  pBasically this      jQueryiframeWrapper.height61p

Negative 3626 pin my project, some entities should have a signature property based on their values. For example, after creating an entity and filling its attributes, when codeentity.saveorupdatecode method is called, hibernate event listener should take the control and gather the next sequence value for uniqueid from db. then the same event should produce a signaturelets say a String based on entity attributes and this uniqueid. after sign, the real saveorupdate event should be called. So entity with sign attribute filled is written to database.p  pthe problem is, in saveorupdate event, i do some work and call saveorupdate, so endless operation occurs.p  pdo you have any solution about this kind of problem rather than using aspect oriented programmingp

Negative 3626 pI have multiple threads lets say two, for now, each of which retrieves an HTML page and writes its content to a file.  The caveat is that each thread wants to write to the same output file. The class with the run method is a static inner class.  The approach I would like to take is to have each thread put the content it wants to write into a queue. THEN, after the thread is finished or all the threads have finished, to iterate over the queues and print the contents to the file.  Im not sure how to implement this.  Again, the class that implements the runnable interface is static.  Im not wellversed in concurrency and not necessarily looking to do anything fancy. Any suggestions for a simple implementationp

Negative 3626 pI am doing the text categorization machine learning problem using Naive Bayes. I have each word as a feature. I have been able to implement it and I am getting good accuracy. p  pIs it possible for me to use tuples of words as featuresp  pFor example, if there are two classes, Politics and sports. The word called government might appear in both of them. However, in politics I can have a tuple government, democracy whereas in the class sports I can have a tuple government, sportsman. So, if a new text article comes in which is politics, the probability of the tuple government, democracy has more probability than the tuple government, sportsman.p  pI am asking this is because by doing this am I violating the independence assumption of the Naive Bayes problem, because I am considering single words as features too.p  pAlso, I am thinking of adding weights to features. For example, a 3tuple feature will have less weight than a 4tuple feature.p  pTheoretically, are these two approaches not changing the independence assumptions on the Naive Bayes classifier Also, I have not started with the approach I mentioned yet but will this improve the accuracy I think the accuracy might not improve but the amount of training data required to get the same accuracy would be less.p

Negative 3626 pIm using a game engine that allows you to program in Lua. The game engine commands are in a DLL created from C. There is a exe created in C that calls a Lua file. This Lua file is where you put all your game code including the main loop. There is no going back and forth with the exe, but you can call functions from the DLL. p  pSo in here before the main loop I create a function which Im going to create a coroutine from. This function iterates over a pretty big table so every n iterations I yield. This function has an infinite while loop around that because I need this stuff to run every single cycle of the main game loop, but its OK if its split between multiple cycles. p  pI then create a coroutine with this function as the parameter. In the main game loop I then resume this coroutine.p  pWhen I run my code I get the error tempt to yield across metamethodCcall boundaryp  pI was reading some stuff online but not really understanding what the issue is here. Once the exe calls the Lua file it doesnt go back to the exe at all until the Lua file is finished, and since I have my main loop in the Lua file it never finishes in my test case.p  pWhat are my options with this thenp
Negative 3626 pIve been working on access management solution for an application Java EE.p  pHere is what I have currently In the application I have a filter that checks whether specific HTTP headers are set and authenticates the user based on these values. The application is never exposed directly to the users, but deployed behind Apache HTTPD that performs SSL client certificate verification. In case verification passes it rewrites some data from certificate to HTTP headers and send request to the JK worker that is handled by application server JBoss.p  pWhat Id like to do reuse the mechanism described above to be able to deal with alternative methods of preauthentication. For instance I need SAML so I was wondering about implementing a component that would handle SSO using SAML or OpenID then set the HTTP headers like above and forward request for processing to JBoss. strongHow that differs from the current implementation described above is that the new authentication mechanism would be implemented in Java rather than as another Apache module.strongp  pMy questions is how to handle communication from one Java EE application to another Java EE application in the same way Apache HTTPD and TomcatJBoss communicates using AJP Is there any service like that in JBossp  pSimilar question Ive just managed to find a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions149662isthereanimplementationofajpprotocoleinjavaIs there an implementation of AJP protocole in Javaap

I want to expand the database setup to have a readonly slave server such that I can spread the reads between both master and slave while continuing to write to the master db server.p  pI have looked at few of options and I believe I cant do this with plain SQLAlchemy. Instead Im planning to create 2 database handles in my webapp, one each for master and slave db servers. Then using a simple random value use either the masterslave db handle for SELECT operations. p  pHowever Im not sure if this is the right way to go with using SQLAlchemy.

Negative 3626 pInvestigating the Web API as part of an MVC 4 project as an alternative way to provide an AJAXbased API.

Negative 3626 pI am working on a CQRSevent store system. At the moment, the pattern that I use is for commands to be synchronous. That is, the user interface does not show an operation as completed until the command is complete, and the successfailure is shown to the user. During execution of the commands, all events generated e.g., action X occurred on aggregate root Y are stored in durable storage.p  pAll of the descriptions of CQRS that I have read implement command storage. I am wondering if this is needed in my situation. p  pOne other note  there are a lot of long running command type actions, so I have broken up operations into a command that generates events, and the events in turn issue more commands. The commands are idempotent, based on the state of the aggregate root. I dont know how this would impact the answer, but it is worth pointing out.p  pThanks, Erickp

Negative 3626 pIm putting together a .Net 4 library that is designed to be distributed as a standalone assembly.  Part of the library does some adhoc web service calls in which I plan on returning a projected version of to the consumer of the library.  There will be an extensive amount of mapping that needs to happen between the webservice response representation and what the consumer of the library will actually get.  Im hoping to leverage a hrefhttpautomapper.org relnofollowAutoMappera for this task as more often than not, conventions will be able to take care of a lot of the boring righttoleft mapping code for me.p  pSo for example, my library might expose code that looks somewhat likep  precodepublic Widget GetWidgetGuid id       Get server representation     ServerWidget serverWidget  this.RequestltServerWidgetgtid       Map to client representation     Widget clientWidget  Mapper.MapltServerWidget, WidgetgtserverWidget      return clientWidget  codepre  pElsewhere in code Ill have obviously needed to call plus any custom configuration for the mappingp  precodeMapper.CreateMapltServerWidget, Widgetgt codepre  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comAutoMapperAutoMapperwikiGettingstarted relnofollowPer design guidelines of AutoMappera, this should be only done once per AppDomain as it is an expensive operation.  Since this library could be used in any number of possible environments ASP.NET, WinForms app, WPF app, unit test runner, etc, how does one go about properly setting the maps up in a situation like thisp  pObviously, my code could expose some sort of method for the client to call to initialize things mapper in this case and assume they did indeed make that call, and at the right time in the application startup process, but that seems like a really lame requirement to impose on a consumer of the library.p  pAnyone have any suggestions for me andor could point me to an opensource project on GitHub, Codeplex, etc that is already doing something like thisp

Negative 3626 pThis is not a programming question, I did try to post on the a hrefhttpkigg.codeplex.com relnofollowKigga dicussion forum but no one seems to be active there. So I am hoping someone here can advise p  pI am using the same project structure as a hrefhttpkigg.codeplex.com relnofollowKigga. p  pIts easy to understand, they have done a good job in organising what goes where. There is a project called Kigg.Infrastructure.EntityFramework.p  pWhat does Infrastructure refer to here  I have an employee webservice to get our employees.p  pI am thinking of creating a separate project in my solution where it creates a reference to the employee web service which can be used through the whole solution instead of referencing this web service in every project project.p  pFollowing Kiggs naming convention, will this all have the word infrastructure in the project namep  pSomething like codeMyProject.Infrastructure.MyEmployeeWebservicecodep  pThis project will have its own mappers to my employee object and a repository to bring data from the web service.p  pPlease can someone advisep  pI know it is not a programming question, but it is a question on the solution structure that anyone else can use as a guide when extendingfollowing the Kigg naming structure.p
Negative 3626 pIm new to PLCrashReporter. I have a question regarding symbolication of crash data. I use PLCrashReporter API to read crash data and send it to a server. After that point, i use symbolicate crash script to symbolicate the crash report. p  pThe problem is I have 10 projects in my workspace. When I generate my app which is shell.app , build process also generates the shell.app.dSYM file. Therefore, I use this .dSYM file to symbolicate in symbolicate script. However, it only symbolicates the hex codes that belong to shell project. See example below.p  precodeThread 3 name  Exception Backtrace Thread 3 0   CoreFoundation                      0x021c0022 0x20c2000  1040418 1   libobjc.A.dylib                     0x00b11cd6 0xb0c000  23766 2   CoreFoundation                      0x02168a48 0x20c2000  682568 3   CoreFoundation                      0x021689b9 0x20c2000  682425 4   shell                               0x0004bd78 [DocumentHubApplicationBarContentView applicationBarButtonTapped] DocumentHubApplicationBarContentView.mm85 5   shell                               0x00010657 [ApplicationBarButton buttonTapped] ApplicationBarButton.mm48 6   CoreFoundation                      0x021c1e99 0x20c2000  1048217 7   UIKit                               0x0109214e 0x1084000  57678 8   UIKit                               0x010920e6 0x1084000  57574 9   UIKit                               0x01138ade 0x1084000  740062 10  UIKit                               0x01138fa7 0x1084000  741287 11  UIKit                               0x01138266 0x1084000  737894 12  UIKit                               0x010b73c0 0x1084000  209856 13  UIKit                               0x010b75e6 0x1084000  210406 14  UIKit                               0x0109ddc4 0x1084000  105924 15  UIKit                               0x01091634 0x1084000  54836 16  GraphicsServices                    0x026b2ef5 0x26ab000  32501 17  CoreFoundation                      0x02194195 0x20c2000  860565 18  CoreFoundation                      0x020f8ff2 0x20c2000  225266 19  CoreFoundation                      0x020f78da 0x20c2000  219354 20  CoreFoundation                      0x020f6d84 0x20c2000  216452 21  CoreFoundation                      0x020f6c9b 0x20c2000  216219 22  GraphicsServices                    0x026b17d8 0x26ab000  26584 23  GraphicsServices                    0x026b188a 0x26ab000  26762 24  UIKit                               0x0108f626 0x1084000  46630 25  shell                               0x0000347d main main.mm42 26  shell                               0x00002425 start  53 27                                   0x00000001 0x0  0 codepre  pAlso, I checked the crash report that is also generated by iOS and its fully symbolicated.

Negative 3626 pthis is the situation I am inp  pI currently have 3 pagesp  ul lipstrongpeople.phpstrong , which is a page in which users can select the user they want to follow and when they click the user they are following them.  each person is linked to follow.php, but the variable username is posted in the link to a different value depending on which is pressed.  ie if anderson cooper is selected, the link that is triggered is follow.phpusernameandersoncooperpli lipstrongfollow.phpstrong , which is a page which is triggered when the user selects the person they want to follow, and this page goes through and follows the person.  This page only works if the user is logged in.  The page GETs the variable username codeusername  GET[username]code, value depending on which link was selected.  Next this username variable is put into the function which follows the user.pli lipstrongLogin.phpstrong , which is a page which allows the user to login on twitter and authorize the app.  I have put code on the top of follow.php that says if the user is not logged in, send them here.  when login.php is done and the user is done, they are sent back to follow.php.  The only problem is the variable username is no longer defined.  I tried setting the variable codeusername  GET[username]code before the redirect to the login page if the user is not logged in but this doesnt work.  for the redirect, I am using thispli ul  pre classlangphp prettyprintoverridecodeifemptySESSION[oauthtoken]     not signed in     dieheader Location twitterlogin.php    codepre  pI tried using this script without the die as well and it still didnt work.  The rest of the codefollow.phpcode code follows this check.  I hope I explained my problem well.  The script works perfectly if the user is already logged in because the login.php never gets called and you never leave follow.php.  But when you leave the page you can not GET[username].  Anyone know what the solution to this is  Thank youp

The main purpose of this layer of protection is defending against intentional or unintentional webserver logging, crash dumps, etc.strongp  pOn the PHP side, a temporary private key will be generated it will expire after a short time.

The reason for private key expiration is to prevent logged encrypted data decryption, in case the server which stores the private key is later compromised.p  pServers compromised scenario someone gets his hands on backups for all machines except the database server and cannot access the database due to firewalling, even if he finds out the user and password. Since the private key which encrypted the logged data no longer exists, there is nothing the attacker can do.p

Negative 3626 pIm using a NSMutableDictionary to cache high scores that I pull from Game Center storing scores by GC rank as key. The pulling happens as soon as the user views that line in a tableview. If there are a million rows and the user views them all, that would mean that the cache fills up to a million rows... Ok in practice I guess Ill be happy if a million people played my game but still to be on the safe side Id like to limit the amount of rows that go into the NSMutableDictionary.p  pAnyone got a simple approach here Maybe another structure than a dictionary would be useful. My idea was to remove the entries from the dictionary that were the most old, and out of current tableview.p

Negative 3626 pIve started playing around with codeexterncode templates a bit and Ive stumbled on an issue which I cant find any relevant information on. Say I have a class template with a nontemplate friend function defined within the class template declaration. I declare some codeexterncode template instantiations for the class, but how do I declare the friend function as extern toop  pHere is some example codep  precode  test.h   template lttypename Tgt class Foo    private     T value   public     friend void somefriendfunctionFooltTgtamp obj        obj.value  T42           void somememberfunctionT rhs  value  rhs     extern template class Fooltintgt extern void somefriendfunctionFooltintgtamp   I tried this also...     test.cpp   include test.h  template class Fooltintgt void somefriendfunctionFooltintgtamp          ... with this. codepre  pWhen I compile the above with or without the commented lines, I only get the following exported symbolp  precode0000000000000000 W ZN3FooIiE20somememberfunctionEi codepre  pSo, the nontemplate friend functions definitely dont get instantiated and codeexterncoded along with the class templates explicit instantiation. Is this normal At least, thats what GCC produces tested on 4.6.3 and 4.7.2. p  pIs there any way that I can get the friend function to be marked extern I know that this isnt a huge problem, since I can happily live with the friend functions being instantiated as needed i.e., nonextern, but Im curious to know if there is a way to do this, if not, was it an oversight or a deliberate thingp  pstrongEDIT The obvious workaroundsstrongp  pMy question is specifically about nontemplate friend functions, not about finding a workaround to avoid the issue, which is trivial. The first obvious workaround is thisp  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt class Foo    private     T value   public     template lttypename Ugt     friend void somefriendfunctionFooltUgtamp obj        obj.value  T42        extern template class Fooltintgt extern template void somefriendfunctionFooltintgtamp    in cpp file   template class Fooltintgt template void somefriendfunctionFooltintgtamp codepre  pAnd another, which matches more closely but is more troublesome, is thisp  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt class Foo   forwarddeclare.  template lttypename Tgt void somefriendfunctionFooltTgtamp   declaration.  template lttypename Tgt class Foo    private     T value   public     friend void somefriendfunctionltgtFooltTgtamp obj   befriend the Tspecialization.   template lttypename Tgt void somefriendfunctionFooltTgtamp obj    definition.   obj.value  T42   extern template class Fooltintgt extern template void somefriendfunctionFooltintgtamp    in cpp file   template class Fooltintgt template void somefriendfunctionFooltintgtamp codepre

Negative 3626 pIm about to write my own, simple library, that should query a few language dictionaries available online and display all results gathered together.p  pI wanted to ask, if anyone knows about any library or example that has this functionallity. To not to reinvent the wheel again.p  pI want it to be as simple as possible. URLs to all queried dictionaries will be stored in an array. All I have to do is to fire as many AJAX calls as there are URLs in an array, gather all results together and put them into some place, like results div or sth.p  pThis task is specific to dictionaries, but of course works nearly similar like querying search engines, with only exception that not one search query but three word, languageform, languageto parameters are variable in each URL.p  pThis has to be done entirely in JavaScript. To be able to run it locally, embed into desktop application etc. I know, that doing this on serverside, in PHP for example, could be easier, but Im looking for JSonly solution to described problem.p
Negative 3626 pI am trying to store the results of my query in a string, and print them to the bottom of my JSP page by passing that string to it.

Negative 3626 pAn iOS 6 iPad app shows content in two UIWebViews. If both web views contain a jquery image rotator, only one will work at a time. Running lt iOS 6, both work properly. p  pIf the content of the nonanimating webview is reloaded, it begins to work, and the other stops. Also, in the simulator ONLY, I can sometimes cause the stopped web view to start and the other to stop by clickingdragging in it. p  pIf one of the web views does NOT have javascript in it, the reloading of the stopped web view does not stop the functioning of the other. p  pMy first thought was this was a focus issue, but the last bit seems to disprove that, and point so some kind of pollution between the two web views. The two rotators have the same selectors and same js scripts, but the js files are cached locally and are renamed uniquely to eliminate any steppingon during the caching process. p  pI cant find anything in the iOS 6 release notes to describe a change in focus between different UIWebViews. p  pThe web views are in an XIB, but but not siblings of the same parent UIView. p  pThe desired behavior is to have neither of the web views go to sleep, obviously. p

Negative 3626 pI am having problems with regard to a strange behaviour of SafariWebkit on Mac OSX systems thats related to the functionality of the back button strongwhile having javascript disabledstrong on the browser.p  pThe scenario I have is a web application which consists of a login page that upon a successful login, would lead the user to page1. If the user logs out of page1, then heshe will get redirected to page2. Out of session and unauthenticated requests to page1 are being redirected to the initial login page via a 302 HTTP Response.p  pIts also worth to mention that responses to requests to page1 have the following HTTP headers present in them to prevent browsers from caching the pagep  precodeCacheControl nocache, nostore, maxage0, mustrevalidate Expires Thu, 1 JAN 1970 Pragma nocache codepre  pUpon a successful log out from page1, the user get redirected to page2. If at this point intime the user decided to click on the back button, then the browser will load page1 from its cache rather than hitting the server again to retrieve a fresh copy. strongPlease not that this all happen while javascript is DISABLED within Safari, having it ENABLED produce the expected result of reloading page1 from the web server thus having the user get redirected to the initial login pagestrongp  pIve tried to set an unload event handler on the page body tag to prevent Webkit from having  the page loaded into its Page Cache, but that didnt seem to solve the problem.p  pOther mainstream browsers, FF, IE and Chrome seem to produce the expected result both in JS and non JS situations.p  pAm I missing something here or this sounds more of a bug with SafariWebKitp  pCheersp

Negative 3626 pIm currently having some performance issues with a Grails application running on Tomcat. During single page loads, Im seeing fairly high CPU usage on the java process around 20, and I worry that this wont scale well.p  pIve looked at both Java Melody as well as the Grails Profiler plugin. However, these tools only seem to tell me what I already know  which pages are loading more slowly than others.p  pIve also checked the number of connections to MySQL, and although there are quite a lot of queries, they seem to be executing almost instantly. Also, the MySQL process never shows up in top as using any meaningful CPU time, so I dont believe this is the source of the slowdown.p  pWhat I need to know is what methods or functions within my code are taking the longest time to run, so that I can evaluate them to see if they can be rewritten. So far, Ive tried manually disabling certain portions of pages to test the load times. But it would be much easier if there were a tool that could help point me to the problematic code. Do such tools existp

Negative 3626 pIve got a simple winform with a bindingSource using a List as Data. Id like to take action whenever the binding sources position is changed. Reading up, it looks like the positionChanged event is what I need. However, in my app Im unable to get this event to fire. p  pThere is a bindingNavigator to use the bindingSoure for navigation and for debugging a button that changes the current binding source position. p  pIve tried to simplify this as much as possible. My form code looks like this  p  precodepublic partial class Form1  Form      protected Listltintgt data      public Form1              InitializeComponent         data  new Listltintgt         data.Add4         data.Add23         data.Add85         data.Add32           private void Form1Loadobject sender, EventArgs e              bindingSource1  new BindingSource         bindingSource1.DataSource  data         bindingNavigator1.BindingSource  this.bindingSource1                       private void bindingSource1PositionChangedobject sender, EventArgs e               Debugger breakpoint here.           Expectation is this code will be executed either when          button is clicked, or navigator is used to change positions.          int x  0            private void button1Clickobject sender, EventArgs e              bindingSource1.Position  2       codepre  pThe eventHandler is autogenerated in the designer p  precode                   bindingSource1                   this.bindingSource1.PositionChanged  new System.EventHandlerthis.bindingSource1PositionChanged codepre  pNow, the trouble is that whenever I run this, the PositionChanged event just will not trigger. Ive verified that bindingSource1.Position changes based on the navigator and the button. But no matter what I do, the event wont actually trip. Im guessing this is something pretty stupid at this point, or Im completely misinterpreting when the event is supposed to fire. p  pUsing .NET 4.5p
Negative 3626 pApologies if this is a basic question, im a very casual programmer.p  pIm writing a program which will search for torrents, grab them based on certain criteria one being that they are indicated as freeware, youll be pleased to hear and then throw them over  to utorrent. Im getting stuck downloading the .torrent file, because, I believe, of the encoding.p  pIve worked out thus far that the bulk of the top of the file can be gzip deflated on the fly using HTTPrequest  but it seems that halfway through the file, something changes  and looking in a hex editor at a .torrent ive grabbed from a site directly versus the one I download here, everything is identical up to a point, then all is totally different.p  pIf im being vague im afraid its because im making this all up as I go along Is it likely that the encoding  compression in a torrent file would change part way through, and how could I catch this in VB to avoid corrupting the latter halfp  pThanks very much in advance, Danp

Negative 3626 pI am developing a mobile website which uses an IMG tag to display an SVG file. The SVG file is about 500 kB. The image renders OK in Android versions of Firefox and Chrome. However, in iOS Safari, I get only the dreaded tiny blue box with a question mark in it.p  pI am aware that there is a limit on the size of image files in iOS. According to Apples a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarysafaridocumentationAppleApplicationsReferenceSafariWebContentCreatingContentforSafarioniPhoneCreatingContentforSafarioniPhone.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40006482SW15Safari Web Content Guidea p  blockquote   pThe maximum size for decoded GIF, PNG, and TIFF images is 3 megapixels for devices with less than 256 MB RAM and 5 megapixels for devices with greater or equal than 256 MB RAM.p      pThat is, ensure that width  height  3  1024  1024 for devices with less than 256 MB RAM. Note that the decoded size is far larger than the encoded size of an image.p blockquote  pI imagine that there is some limit on the size of SVG files, but since they are vectorized, it doesnt really make sense to describe their size in terms of decoded pixels. Does anyone know how the limit on SVG files is determinedp  pP.S. When I put browse the SVG file directly instead of through an HTML page, I am able to view the image. I am also able to view the SVG file inside of an IFRAME. But not using the IMG tag.p

Negative 3626 pIm developing a website that I want to feel appy, for users thatll access it through phones, tablets, and desktop PCs. Im using jQuery Mobile for that.p  pFor some reason, jQuery mobile emrequiresem a viewport tag with widthdevicewidth, initialscale1.p  pIf I choose any other width, any other initialscale, or I remove either, then jQuery mobile behaves horribly bad. transitions look jerky, things jump up and down, its horrible.p  pNow, 320px is a bit narrow for my content, and I was kind of counting on setting the width of the viewport to at least 480px, maybe more, so that things would just look smaller, and thered still be no horizontal scrolling.p  pIs there any other way to achieve this basically, being able to fit more than 320px of content, while still keeping the viewport tag as jquery mobile requires itp  pThanksbr Danielp
Negative 3626 pI have a bit of a problem. Ive developed an app available for the iOS App store and the client wanted to add some new documents to the app. I developed this app in Flash Builder as per my employers wants. Since I have added the new documents to my app, it fails to install on any device for development testing. My provisioning profile and developer certificate are exactly the same as they were when I first built my app  they havent expired either.p  pIm literally lost as to what could be causing my App to now fail to install. Recently I found a website that recommended doing a codesign command through terminal on my .app file.p  pI did that and got these messages but I do not know what it is telling mep

However, if I do that, it appears that whenever I change collectionA, the changes to it do not cause an event to propagate through the CompositeCollection and notify things that it is bound to Some of those things, are actually my own classes.p  pSo, my second approach was a quick and dirty functionp  precode    public void HookCollectionObservableCollectionltTgt dest, ObservableCollectionltTgt source         source.CollectionChanged  new NotifyCollectionChangedEventHandlerdelegateobject sender, NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs e                               Apply the same changes to the destination collection                 if e.Action  NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Reset                                      foreach T o in source                                              dest.Removeo                                                          if e.NewItems  null                                      foreach T o in e.NewItems                                              dest.Addo                                                       if e.OldItems  null                                      foreach T o in e.OldItems                                              dest.Removeo                                                           codepre  pBut I quickly found that in the Reset action, the items that were originally inside the source collection have already been destroyed, so I dont know what to remove from the destination ones.p  pThis property is bound to a control that has some properties on it that are dependent upon the contents of this list, ie... Minimum and Maximum values of the entire set. These are in turn bound to the control. So being able to iterate over it as an IEnumerable would be very useful and CompositeCollection makes this difficult.p  pAs such, I need to have a clean way of being notified of changes to the list and the sub lists. p  pAt the moment, the only solution I can see is in my control class, detecting the CompositeCollection, then iterating over each CollectionContainer and attaching to its CollectionChanging event if it has one. However, as you can imagine, this is a rather nasty way to hook into events. Itd be nice to have some way of aggregating those events cleanly. I thought that was CompositeCollection but apparently not.p  pThanks for any thoughts you might havep

Negative 3626 pIn the current version of the .NET framework, and under normal circumstances i.e. without intentionally modifying the invocation list, are handlers for an event strongalwaysstrong invoked in the order in which they are registered  This would be consistent with the documented behavior of multicast delegates, with which events are implemented.p  pThe accepted answer to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1645478orderofeventhandlerexecutionthis questiona says that invoking handlers in the order of their registration is an implementation detail that may change in some future version of the framework.  I believe such a change by Microsoft is unlikely, therefore I am confining my question to the current version of the .NET framework.  A comment on that same answer says that it is possible to register handlers such that they are strongnotstrong invoked in their registration order.  If this is true then please demonstrate code that results in this outoforder execution.  Please do not include code which intentionally modifies the invocation list.  What I am after here is whether or not I can depend on event handler invocation occurring in same order as registration in all current versions of the .NET framework.p

Negative 3626 pI have a bar chart that I generate dynamically. I have used a tricky fix to show datalabel above the series. I use two graphs, setting fill property of one of them to none. Then I set the datalabel of this invisible graph to Inside Base. Thus I can set the ranges of both graphs to same selection and display same data.p  pThe issue I am facing is that when the length of datalabel exceeds the length of corresponding bar, the label tends to shift left and go outside the plot area. Due to this, the data label appears clipped from left.p  pIs there a way by which I can set the position of datalabels of a bar graph relative to the plot area Like setting the left of datalabel to  parent.Position.Left  10 p

Negative 3626 pAfter reading a bunch of questions  articles on this topic there is still one thing unclear to me.p  pFrom what I understand and please correct me if Im wrong is that the value of a variable can be cached locally to a thread so if one thread updates the value of that variable this change may not be visible to another thread. The use of codevolatilecode then is to essentially force all threads to read the value of the variable from the same location. Furthermore, all literature on this topic states that synchronizing on that variable will have the same effect. p  pMy problem is that nothing that Ive read ever explicitly states that synchronizing on a emdifferentem variable will cause this same behavior but frequently provides a code example stating that in the following two cases the value that is read from the variable will be up to date p  precodevolatile int x ... int y  x codepre  pand p  precodefinal Object lock  new Object int x ... synchronizedlock      int y  x  codepre  pThe question is then is it the case that synchronizing on any arbitrary variable will force every variable access within the synchronized block to access the most up to date value of that variablep

Negative 3626 pIve got input that is analogous to tags, where there are a couple of strings per record, and they should be thought of as keywords, not to be tokenized or broken up or analyzed in any particular way.  I want it to show up in faceting asis, including spaces, slashes, dashes and ampersands. p  pI dont think I need multifield here.  There is one input value per record keyPhrases but the input value is a simple json array of strings. p  pI want elasticsearch to insert into the facets each of the values, and tag the record with all of the phrases. Usually there are only one or two or three phrases per record, but there could be more.  The set of keyPhrases is fairly small, like 30 or at most like 50.  They could be thought of as categories. p  pThe faceting keeps breaking up the input strings and using lowercasing, even though Im trying to specify notanalyzed, keyword tokenizer, keyword analyzer, and trying things like that. p  pI have other fields that keep their spacing and capitalization as I desire in the facets returned, however those fields are notanalyzed and are also store true, but are also just exactly 1 string input per record, as opposed to many per record. p  pI could just take the top 1 keyPhrase per record and flatten it, but ideally all the tags would work and be available as facets. p  pAny ideas on how to do thisp

Negative 3626 pIm currently working on a PHP script, and Im not sure what is the best practise for the followingp  pSince PHP does not allow multiple constructors within a class User, I have a constructor which has an array as argument for the id,name,address, see code block below.p  pWhen this array does not contain an id, but is does contain other attributes such as name, address, it calls the insert method of the class and assigns the id of the inserted row to the id attribute of the class.

A subpeptide is created when bonds between 2 aminoacids are broken. For example for the peptide ABCD, its subpeptides would be A, B, C, D, AB, BC, CD, DA, ABC, BCD, CDA, DAB. Thus, the amount of possible subpeptides from a peptide of length n will always be nn1. Note that not all of them are substrings from peptide DA, CDA....p  pIve written a code that generate combinations. However, there are some excessive elements, such as not linked aminoacids AC, BD.... Does anyone have a hint of how could I eliminate those, since peptide may have a different length each time the function is called Heres what I have so farp  precodedef Subpeptidespeptide      subpeptides  []     from itertools import combinations     for n in range1, lenpeptide         subpeptides.extend     [.joincomb for comb in combinationspeptide, n]          return subpeptides codepre  pHere are the results for peptide ABCDp  precode[A, B, C, D, AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD, ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD] codepre  pThe order of aminoacids is not important, if they represent a real sequence of the peptide.

Negative 3626 pWorking on a Google Cloud Messagingenabled App for a class.  I had roundtrip Appbackend server, backend serverGCMApp working on both my phone and tablet.  After getting things stable, I uninstalled the App on the phone mainly to trash the database that Id filled with bogus entries and then reinstalled.  However now, when the app attempts to reregister with GoogleCloudMessaging, it kicks back SERVICENOTAVAILABLE.  I had run into this a couple days ago, but it seems like after waiting a couple of minutes, itd be able to register.  I figured it was something on Googles end needing to update.  However Ive let my phone sit for almost 12 hours now and it still is unable to get a new registration ID.p  pIs there something more required to get a new registration ID than a call to register  Ive tried calling unregister as well, thinking that maybe GCM needed a hint that the phone needed a new registration ID and that the old one was invalid, but that also kicked back SERVICENOTAVAILABLE.  As a side note, the tablet which has a registration ID continues to work fine.  Messages are being received from GCM.  I just get nothing on the phone.p  pOther info  This is using the HTTP downstream only GCM configuration, Phone is API 17, Tablet is API 19.  Play services are uptodate.  The implementation I used for the receiver and registration is pretty close to what Google provided as their example.p

I can even parse it a bit to split the string to function name and function arguments names. But how can I print all function arguments without knowing too much about them like types or number of arguments Likep  precodeint foochar x, float y       PRINTARGSarg1, arg2  Gives me the string arg1  A, arg2  13.37      ...   int main      fooA, 13.37     ...  codepre  pP.S.

Negative 3626 pI am working on an app that is providing a way for an user to define a SQL query and run it against the database. The only purpose of the query is to create a dataset which will be used to build a report. As this is a shared database meaning large number of accounts with peraccount tables, security is very important.p  pI am looking for the best way to verify that the supplied query is SELECT type only  meaning the user cannot run DELETE, UPDATE, etc.. Of course, the verification must be server side. The project is written in C.p  pThe first check is to verify that the query begins with SELECT, but it is not enough because of subqueries. I was thinking to verify if the query string C contains some reserved words like EXEC, DELETE, UPDATE, INSERT.p  pAre there any ways to hack this verification using ampnbsp or other chars  Which reserved words must be blocked  Any other thoughts or ideas p  pThanks a lot for your timep

P1 has four tasks T11, T12, T13 and T14. P2 has two tasks T12, T22. Now the user starts submitting results. Since the maximum number of results the user should submit is 3 see above SQL, in the beginning the query should always return any of the tasks of P1. Assuming the user has now submitted results to T11, T12 and T14, she should emnotem solve T13. Instead, the query should return any of the tasks of P2. btw there is also a check whether all tasks have been solved by this user  I omitted this for simplicity.p  pLooks pretty straightforward, doesnt it I would really like to use the ORM whenever possible, but I have no clue how to get this done.p  pThanks in advancep

In the Main class Im also declaring my background var, and putting it as a public static var. Since I need to access this background from two other classes, I dont see another option but to declare it as that, even though I think it is not ideal. I will come back to this later in the explaination.p  pMy Route class is dynamically creating new flights on the screen, hence the name. This is based on the Airport.returnROUTE array. I need these flights to be added as childs to the background, which was created at Main class as mentioned. This is also why I added this as a parameter when calling the route function.p  precodethis.myparent  pMyParent codepre  pI use the line above to be able to refer to the main instance. Since the Route instance is no movieclip I guess this is the only way to be able to refer to this.p  pAs earlier mentioned the Route instance dynamically creats newflights.p  precodenewflight  new

Negative 3626 pThis is probably a question a bit in between SO and UX.se, but please bare with me. p  pIm implementing a signuplogin sytem which allows for multiple ways of authentication social signups using Facebook, Twitter, Github and a local username  password signup. p  pIn the backend Im having a codeUsercode model and a codePassportcode model. A codeUsercode may have multiple codePassportscode, meaning a codeUsercode may authenticate through different means e.g. through local signin,. or through facebook for example p  pFor good measure the codePassportscode of a particular codeUsercode will always be from a different provider facebook, twitter, local. I.e. a Facebookpassport, a Localpassport, etc. p  pThis seems like a good way and would allow me to have a codeUser accountcode connected to multiple ways of authentication. p  pIm familiar with the security issues this might raise, so for passports to be combinedmerged a User has to be logged in to both.p  pOk on to the problem. Consider the following flow p  ol liusera signs up with a provider, say local, with email useragmail.comli liusera signs out or has its session expired.li liusera signs in using another provider, say facebook. Chances are the facebook account has a emailrecord of useragmail.comli ol  pCurrently, Ive defined codeemailcode to be unique on the codeUsercodemodel. This would mean the above signup would fail, because theres already a codeUseraccountcode that, by means of the local Passport, has the mentioned emailaddress. p  pWhat would be considered a best practice in a situation like this I trust there must be many implementations floating around that must have seen this problem popup. p  pOptions p  ol liWarn the user the authentication isnt possible and mention the user that the current emailaddress is already registered by means of another authentication mechanism This would be reasonably userfriendly. li listrikeNote that a Useraccount, by means of a different provider exists with the same emailaddress and as a consequence merge the new Passport with the User.strike. I just put this in for good measure this is a pretty big attackvector and would allow a userb to get access to an account by faking the emailaddress through a social provider which doesnt do emailvalidationli liDont have a uniqueness constraint on codeltuser,emailgtcode, but on codeltpassport, emailgtcode. This would allow a new codeUsercode and associated codePassportcode to be created and all goes well. Now the same actual person probably has 2 User Accounts 1 for each authentication provider. As a next stage allow the Useraccounts to be merged, by signing in to both and acknowledging the merge. li ol  pIm leaning towards 3, but 1 is simpler. Im not sure, what do you think  Have you encountered this before p

Negative 3626 pstrongDescriptionstrongp  pIm working on an embedded Linux system using kernel 3.4 and bionic, Androidlike that is running on a multicore ARMv7a SoC. We have a userspace thread that is basically servicing events coming out of the kernel.

After adding backtraces to traceschedswitch and traceschedwake I managed to isolate several causes of latency, with the main two beingp  ul lipstrongPriority inversionstrong due to mmmmapsem being taken by some other thread in the same process doing a codeforkcodecodemmapcodecodemunmapcode and therefore not available during codefutexwaitcode or codetracingmarkwritecode for the RT thread. This one can mostly be avoided by restructuring some code and using vfork instead of fork in some places. pli lipstrongFailure to run scheduled taskstrong when codeschedwakecode is called from a different source CPU than the CPU it needs to run on. This seems to be a bigger problem. I traced it through the scheduler and it seems that in the bad case codewakeupprocesscode calls codetrytowakeupcode which winds up calling codettwuqueuecode which is where things get interesting.pli ul  pInside codettwuqueuecode we do not enter the if because codecpussharecachecode always returns true for any of our cores that sounds right, shared L2. Which means it simply calls codettwudoactivatecode for the task and exits. codettwudoactivatecode seems to only put the task on the right run queue and mark it as codeTASKRUNNINGcode, but does not have any SMP handling.p  pI added the following after codepgtstate  TASKRUNNINGcode in codettwudowakeupcodep  precodeifdef CONFIGSMP       if taskcpup  smpprocessorid           smpsendrescheduletaskcpup endif codepre  pand it fixes the problem by forcing the target CPU to run the scheduler. However, I suspect this isnt how its supposed to work, and even if this is a real bug then theres probably a more refined fix. I checked the latest kernel 3.14 and the code in core.c looks pretty much the same. p  pAny ideas why this is Why does it not call codettwuqueueremotecode if codecpussharecachecode returns true So what if they share cache  I could see how thats relevant for a migration decision, but whether the wakeup is done locally or remotely Maybe our  codecpussharecachecode should be returning false That function doesnt seem to be well documented or Im not looking in the right placesp

Negative 3626 pI am not sure how to solve this problem within the constraints.p  pShortened problem formulationp  ol liWord as any sequence of capital letters AZ not limited to just dictionary words.li liConsider list of permutations of all characters in a word, sorted lexicographicallyli liFind a position of original word in such a listli liDo not generate all possible permutations of a word, since it wont fit in timememory constraints. li liConstraints word length lt 25 characters memory limit 1Gb, any answer should fit in 64bit integerli ol  pOriginal problem formulationp  blockquote   pConsider a word as any sequence of capital letters AZ not limited to just dictionary words. For any word with at least two different letters, there are other words composed of the same letters but in a different order for instance, STATIONARILYANTIROYALIST, which happen to both be dictionary words for our purposes AAIILNORSTTY is also a word composed of the same letters as these two. We can then assign a number to every word, based on where it falls in an alphabetically sorted list of all words made up of the same set of letters. One way to do this would be to generate the entire list of words and find the desired one, but this would be slow if the word is long. Write a program which takes a word as a command line argument and prints to standard output its number. Do not use the method above of generating the entire list. Your program should be able to accept any word 25 letters or less in length possibly with some letters repeated, and should use no more than 1 GB of memory and take no more than 500 milliseconds to run.

Because right now, if we have a script that does some nice things on a Spreadsheet or any other container we face two major problems.p  pFirst, its very difficult to distribute your script. It often involves multiple steps a enduser have difficulty to do, or have them create the document from a template you setup previously. p  pAnd the second problem is maintainingupdating a distributed script, because we have one independent copy on each file. And even if you have access to all files, updating is a nightmare. Even if you use libraries and just need to get in to each one to update the library number since the library development mode only works if all the users have edit permissions on your library, which is crazy.p  pIf we could have a single standalone script that we, the developers, could control the updatedeployment version for all our usersdocuments, just like we do for webapps, it would be greatp  pLolop

Negative 3626 pI am implementing the ability to add and delete usercreated events from the iOS Calendar from within my app. I have coded the request for permission to access Calendar for when the user creates an event, and its working great. I save the event on a server, and I allow them to later delete the event, and when that occurs I delete the event from the Calendar as well. It is possible someone could create an event outside of this app, open the app, then delete their appointment that is fetched from the server. There is no event stored in Calendar in this case, yet it still needs to look to see if one exists to try to delete it, and it fails because I did not ask for the users permission to get access to the Calendar in this case. p  pBut I dont want to ask the user for permission when deleting because the user has no idea why the app would want access to the Calendar because they never knew it could save the appointment to the Calendar  they created it on the website, and there is no reason they should grant it at that point in time because its going to do nothing anyways. p  pTherefore my question is, is it possible to determine if your app currently has access to the Calendar without making a request which will result in an automatic alert being displayed to the user in the case where permission is not granted  see request code below I simply want to search for the event to try to delete it only if I already have access to the Calendar, and if I dont, I wont try to delete anything.p  precode[eventStore requestAccessToEntityTypeEKEntityTypeEvent completionBOOL granted, NSError error      if granted          already have access or user tapped on Allow in popup          ... codepre

Negative 3626 pis it possible to target only a view controllers root view when using UIAppearance  I would like to setBackgroundColor for all of my controllers from my app delegate, but want to target only the direct view on a view controller. Thanks.p  pTo elaborate, each UIViewController subclass has its own UIView object you can call via its view property.  Thats the view you put any stuff on like UITableView, UITabBar, etc in storyboard.  I want the proxy to only apply to that direct view, since everything in UIKit is pretty much a subclass of UIView.  p  pThe purpose for this is is to centralize control on my view controllers appearance.  Its occurring to me that perhaps maybe I should just use subclass of UIViewController, but I guess itd still be cool to have another place to do what I just described.p

Negative 3626 pIm working on a python script but it uses a library called Selenium to perform most of its tasks. This script needs to be able to run in a windows environment and I cant go through the trouble of installing Selenium on every machine that I decide to run this script on. Ive heard of py2exe but havent tried it out and am not sure if it will help here. Will I be able to run my script without having to install selenium when using py2exe It doesnt seem like it would work since selenium isnt built into python.p  pId like to be able to run this script on Windows without having to install python but Ill be satisfied if I can get it to work without having to install selenium. Im not sure how possible this is and Im actually fairly new to developing in python so I dont know if this idea will work out.p  pActually, other people will be using this script and it would be best if they dont have to go through the trouble of installing python and the selenium library just to use the script. They arent exactly familiar with python or programming in general, so installing selenium could be a problem for them. Id like to make the use of my script as user friendly as possible.p  pThe script mainly deals with automating a website. I understand that this can be done in vbs and it would be better in vbs for windows but Ive already made it in python and dont want to go through the trouble of rewriting it in vbs, since Ive already spent a lot of time on this already.p  pIve tried many Google searches and cant find much about this topic which leads me to believe its not possible. The closest solution Ive found is py2exe but will it still work if my script uses a library not built into pythonseleniump  pIm sorry if this question was kind of nooby, Im just trying to learn.

Negative 3626 pSo we have code that has been working for a while except this month.  p  pWe made some changes and I wasnt involved in the changes but I am in charge of fixing the error.br Now whats weird is in every other python process thats running this code works it has only broken in one process, yet its the exact same code just different database tables. Now my first thought is that the data in the database must be wrong, however the way the code works is it takes samples from a intermediary database and writes that months data to a histories table in an oracle database.  p  pThe problem is for some reason it is stuck on june. All of the processes function virtually the same way, so there is data in the samples tables in the intermediary database for july just not in the histories database for july. However, mind you all other processes function the same way so they wouldnt have had histories data when they first ran for july. p  precode  cursor.executealter session set timezoneUTC   cursor.executeselect nvltocharmaxdatetime,YYYYMMDD HH24MISS,00000000 000000,                            tochartruncsysdate,MM  1,YYYYMM,                            tocharsysdate,YYYYMM                       from vmstoragehistories           lastdate,lastmonth,currentmonth  cursor.fetchone      if currentmonth  lastdate[7]    Start the summarization for the current month      startdate  currentmonth  01 000000   else      if lastdate  00000000 000000         try            pgcursor.executeselect tocharmindatetime,YYYYMMDD HH24MISS from storagesamples            startdate,  pgcursor.fetchone         except            postgres.rollback            startdate  19700101 000000      else         startdate  lastmonth  01 000000      try         Purge the old data      cursor.executedelete from vmstoragehistories where datetime gt totimestamps,YYYYMMDD HH24MISS  startdate   except      pass      if there are no rows, thats ok    stmt  select distinct tochardatetime,YYYYMM,                    datastoreid,                    vmid               from storagesamples              where datetime gt totimestamps,YYYYMMDD HH24MISS  startdate    pgcursor.executestmt codepre  pHowever, to me this code looks like it could never insert for the next month because of the logic though this has been working and it was actually copied from a working copy, but it doesnt work for this process which doesnt make sense.  p  pThe only thing it could be is the data but the programs were written to always run and insert data for the next month its perplexing.p

Negative 3626 pI have a WPFMVVM application running on windows 7. Most of my users have windows 7 machines but I would like to develop an enhanced touchenabled version for windows 8 but need to keep the windows 7 version up to date. The app currently works as is on windows 8 with touches acting as clicks. Not including the ability to run on an rt tablet, what benefits would I gain from this rewrite The purpose for the expansion is to take an application with a lot of repetitive clicking and make it more efficient and less of a strain on longterm users. The application will likely never need to run on a tablet as it requires a lot of screen space and visual inspection of multiple images. p  pFor example, are there specific gestures like pinch and zoom which are markedly easier to implement in windows store apps than WPF p  pI have struggled with how to ask this question, so if Ive missed the pertinent title, Id be happy to change it for clarity.p

Negative 3626 pA few weeks ago I was asked by my church to create a new website for them which I happily obliged to. Ive already created a mockup in PS and Im coding it right now. I created the navigation bar and it is working properly as I had intended.p  pHowever Im running into a glaring problem concerning the spaces in between the menu items. It seems like it may be an easy fix, but I cannot seem to figure it out. The menu bar is set up as unordered and ordered lists. I have them evenly spread out, but in between the empty spaces, the mouse cursor changes from a pointer into an I bar, as if there is invisible text.p  pFor me, this is not ideal, and Id much prefer that when hovering over this empty space between the menu items that it would stay as a pointer for the cursor instead of this I bar. Also, if you highlight the entire menue, the spaces also highlight as well and connect with the menu items. That is also not ideal for me, and it makes me confused why the empty spaces are sort of acting like invisible text.p  pHere is my menu bar CSS codep  precodeltstyle typetextcssgt  nav  position relative width960px zindex9999 marginleftauto marginrightauto padding0 backgroundcolortransparent textalignjustify   bar1  backgroundcolortransparent padding0 textalign justify overflow hidden height39px bordertop 1px solid 222222 borderbottom 1px solid 90908e backgroundcolortransparent   bar1gtli  displayinlineblock margintop8px height100 backgroundcolortransparent     bar1gtligta  fontfamilyOswald,Verdana, Geneva, sansserif fontsize15px color464748 textdecorationnone   bar1gtligtahover,bar1gtligtaactive,bar1gtlihovergta  fontfamilyOswald,Verdana, Geneva, sansserif  fontsize15px color2b77a0 textdecorationnone      bar1gtligtulgtli  bordertop none height33px margintop8px left 0 position absolute width 100 textdecorationnone backgroundcolortransparent paddingtop7px   bar1gtlihovergtulgtli displayblock  bar1gtligtulgtli displaynone textdecorationnone   bar1gtligtulgtligta  fontfamilyAntenna Thin, Arial, Helvetica, sansserif fontsize15px color222222 textdecorationnone   bar1gtligtulgtligtahover, bar1gtligtulgtligtaactive, bar1gtligtulgtlihovergta,  fontfamilyAntenna Thin, Arial, Helvetica, sansserif color222222   li  liststyletypenone   .filler   width100 display inlineblock height0px cursorpointer  ltstylegt codepre  pAnd here is my HTML coding Ignore the comments, I use them so I dont get lost when I take breaksp  precodeltnavgt ltul idbar1gt      ltBegin About Usgt     ltligtlta hrefgtABOUT USltagt         ltBegin drop down menu itemsgt         ltulgt             ltligt                 lta hrefgtltfont color2b77a0gtltfontgt New to Nederland First Assemblyltagt                           lta hrefgtltspan stylemarginleft10pxgtltfont color2b77a0gtltfontgt Our Historyltspangtltagt                 lta hrefgtltspan stylemarginleft10pxgtltfont color2b77a0gtltfontgt Our Beliefsltspangtltagt             ltligt          ltulgt         ltEnd drop down menu itemsgt     ltligt     ltEnd About Usgt              ltBegin Ministriesgt     ltligtlta hrefgtMINISTRIESltagt         ltBegin drop down menu itemsgt         ltulgt             ltligt                 lta hrefgtltfont color2b77a0gtltfontgt Kidsltagt                           lta hrefgtltspan stylemarginleft10pxgtltfont color2b77a0gtltfontgt Youthltspangtltagt                 lta hrefgtltspan stylemarginleft10pxgtltfont color2b77a0gtltfontgt Womenltspangtltagt                 lta hrefgtltspan stylemarginleft10pxgtltfont color2b77a0gtltfontgt Menltspangtltagt             ltligt          ltulgt         ltEnd drop down menu itemsgt     ltligt     ltEnd Ministriesgt                      ltBegin Eventsgt     ltligtlta hrefgtEVENTSltagt         ltBegin drop down menu itemsgt         ltulgt             ltligt                 lta hrefgtltfont color2b77a0gtltfontgt Latest Newsltagt                           lta hrefgtltspan stylemarginleft10pxgtltfont color2b77a0gtltfontgt Monthly Calendarltspangtltagt             ltligt          ltulgt         ltEnd drop down menu itemsgt     ltligt     ltEnd Eventsgt                          ltBegin Listen Onlinegt     ltligtlta hrefgtLISTEN ONLINEltagt         ltBegin drop down menu itemsgt         ltul stylebackgroundcolorredgt             ltligt                 lta hrefgtltfont color2b77a0gtltfontgt Sermonsltagt                           lta hrefgtltspan stylemarginleft10pxgtltfont color2b77a0gtltfontgt Teachingsltspangtltagt                 lta hrefgtltspan stylemarginleft10pxgtltfont color2b77a0gtltfontgt Archiveltspangtltagt             ltligt          ltulgt         ltEnd drop down menu itemsgt     ltligt     ltEnd Listen Onlinegt     ltligtlta hrefpagescontact.htmlgtCONTACT USltagtltligt     ltli classfillergtltligt ltulgt codepre  pbr p  pAnd here is hopefully a working JS Fiddle     a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netBroliyemze0je1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netBroliyemze0je1ap

Negative 3626 pThe new firewallcmd command seems to have the public interface automatically a member of the public zone.  The localhost interface is not really a member of the public zone concept, and it seems appropriate that lo is not a member of this default zone.p  pI would like to ensure that memcached is available on localhost.  We have some customers that zealously set their default policies to DROP, and if my service has a port registered in the firewall, they are ok with that.

Negative 3626 pIm running into an issue on a clients website. I recently redesigned it in Wordpress. I used a development environment local to work, then I used BackupBuddy to migrate the site live to GoDaddy, where my client hosts his site. Its a Linux environment on GoDaddy. The homepage worksshows up fine. However the subpages of the site are not resolving I get a 404 error page...due to permalinks issue it appears. When I turn off permalinks, the pages show up fine. Ive switched to other themes and same issue. I searched the web and tried various solutions such as turning them off, then on again. Didnt work. I deleted the .htaccess file and let WP recreate it. Still doesnt work. File permissions on .htaccess are 644. I get no errors that the htaccess file isnt writeable by WP or anything. GoDaddy is insistent that the problem is in scripting and coding and is out of scope of their support. It works fine on my dev site and another remote dedicated server I have, so GoDaddy seems to be the main reason its not working and I dont know what else to try besides recommending my client switch to my hosting. Can someone help Thanks,p

Negative 3626 pI have a VB.net program that has a splashscreen. While the main window is loading, I search the network with a multithreading solution I created. I.e.

What would be the best way to do thisp  p2 How can I write a batch file to run my app at a predetermined time of day in the cloudp  pI understand this does not have code, but I really hope someone can point me to the right direction. I have spent lots of time trying to understand this myself but still am unsure. Tks in adv.p  pUpdate The application is a Twilio app that makes calls to people, the script simply applies an algorithm to make calls in a certain fashion and the database is a mysql db that provides the details of people to be called.p

Negative 3626 h2Setuph2  pThere is a program running that is performing arbitrary computations and writing a status an integer value, representing strongprogressstrong to a file. The integer values can only be incremented. p  pNow I am developing an other application that can among other things perform arithmetic operations, e.g., comparisons, on those integer values. The files are permanently deleted and written by a different program. As such, there is no guarantee that a file exists at any time.p  pBasically, the application needs to execute something arbitrary, but has a constraint on the other programs progress, i.e., it may only execute something if the other program has done enough work. p  h2Problemh2  pWhen performing the arithmetic operations, the application should not care about where the integer values come from. Especially, accessing those integer values must not throw an exception. How should I separate all the bad things that can happen when performing io accessp  pNote that I do not want the execution thread to block until a value can be read from the file. E.g., say the file system dies somehow, then the integer values will not be updated, but the main thread should still continue to work. This desire is driven by the definition of the arithmetic comparison as a predicate, which has exactly two outcomes, true and false, but no third erroroutcome. Thats why I think that the values that are read from the file would need to be cached somehow. p  h2Limitationh2  pJava 1.7, Scala 2.11p  h2Current Approachh2  pI have a solution that looks as if it would work, but I am not sure if there could something go wrong. p  pThe solution is to maintain a cache of those integer values for each file. The core functionality is provided the getters of the cache, while there is a separate updaterthread that constantly reads the files and updates the chaches. p  pIf an error occurs the producer should take notice i.e., log the error, but continue to run, because an incomplete computation should not affect subsequent computations. p  pA minimal example of what I am currently doing would look something like this p  precodeobject Application     def mainargs Array[String]      val caches  args.mapfilename gt new CachePaths.getfilename     val producer  new Threadnew Updatercaches     producer.start     executecaches     producer.interrupt      def executevalues Array[AccessValue]      while values.head.getValue lt 5  This should never throw an exception     class Updatercaches Array[Cache]    def run      var interrupted  false     whileinterrupted        caches.foreachcache gt          try            val input  Files.newInputStreamcache.file           cache.updateValueparseinput          catch            case  InterruptedException gt              interrupted  true           case t Throwable gt              log.errort             continue as if nothing happend                           def parseinput InputStream Int  input.read  In reality, some xml parsing   trait AccessValue    def getValue Int  should not throw an exception  class Cacheval file Path extends AccessValue    private val value  0   def getValue  value   def updateValuenewValue Int  value  newValue   codepre  pDoing it like this works on a synthetic test setup, but I am wondering whether something bad can happen.

Negative 3626 pIm building an app that loads news posts. i have a custom adapter and when the application launch I set the listview the adapter and fill it with data. the problem that I have to sources of data, the first is popular news and the second recent news that the user can switch between on click. the default is recent news. when the user clicks on popular news I clear the adapter and the arrayList, fill it with new data and attach it to new list view.p  pmy problem is that when I do it, nothing is shown on screen, and only when I start to scroll the screen fill again with data. how can I avoid from the situation then user click on the popular news and see nothing to the list viewp  pthis is and adapter class p  precodeOverride public int getItemViewTypeint position      if position  0          return 0      else if position  1         return 1     if position gt 1 ampamp position lt 5          return 2      else          return 1         Override public int getViewTypeCount      return 3    Override public View getViewfinal int position, final View convertView,         ViewGroup parent      View row  convertView     final ViewHolder holder     int type  getItemViewTypeposition      if first time you load this line     if row  null          LayoutInflater inflater  Activity context.getLayoutInflater         holder  new ViewHolder          if type  0              row  inflater.inflateR.layout.gapbetweenmainposttotop,                     null, true             row.setTag0             return row                   if type  1  type  3              row  inflater.inflateR.layout.newmainpost, null, true             holder.title  TextView row                     .findViewByIdR.id.textViewMainTitle             holder.pubDate  TextView row                     .findViewByIdR.id.mainPostDate             holder.postImage  ImageView row                     .findViewByIdR.id.imageViewMain             holder.postLikes  TextView row                     .findViewByIdR.id.postLikesMain             holder.postCommunts  TextView row                     .findViewByIdR.id.postCommuntsMain             holder.postShares  TextView row                     .findViewByIdR.id.postSharesMain             holder.likesharecommunt  LinearLayout row                     .findViewByIdR.id.sharelikecommunt             holder.postLikesImage  ImageView row                     .findViewByIdR.id.imageViewLike              row.setTagholder          else if type  2              row  inflater.inflateR.layout.newmainsubpost, null, true             holder.title  TextView row.findViewByIdR.id.textViewSub1             holder.pubDate  TextView row.findViewByIdR.id.postDateSub             holder.postImage  ImageView row                     .findViewByIdR.id.imageViewSub1             holder.likesharecommunt  LinearLayout row                     .findViewByIdR.id.sharelikecommunt             holder.postLikes  TextView row.findViewByIdR.id.postLikes             holder.postCommunts  TextView row                     .findViewByIdR.id.postComments             holder.postShares  TextView row                     .findViewByIdR.id.subPostShares             holder.postLikesImage  ImageView row                     .findViewByIdR.id.imageViewLike             row.setTagholder                else          ifrow.getTag.toString.equals0             return row         else         holder  ViewHolder row.getTag           ....... codepre  pthis is the onClick methodp  precodeprivate OnClickListener changeNewsSourceListener  new OnClickListener       Override     public void onClickView v          if v  popularNews              adapter.clear             postsArray.clear              sort  popularity             pageNumber  1             addItems                  codepre  pand this is where the adapter fills with data the addItems methodp  precode    public void addItems       new RoboAsyncTaskltArrayListltPostgtgtthis          protected void onPreExecute                     public ArrayListltPostgt call throws Exception               try                  String url  context.getResources.getString                         R.string.servicesUrl                 url  page  pageNumber  ampsort  sort                 return DataPosts.getInstancecontext.getPostsurl              catch Throwable e                  Log.iexption, e.toString                 e.printStackTrace                 throw new Exceptione.getMessage                                 protected void onSuccessjava.util.ArrayListltPostgt result              swipeLayout.setRefreshingfalse             postsArray.addAllresult             mainListView.removeAllViewsInLayout             adapter.notifyDataSetChanged                    protected void onExceptionException e                       Log.iexption, e.toString              .execute   codepre

Negative 3626 h2Backgroundh2  pI am using slf4j with Logback as underlying logger. p  pA system i.e., a bunch of interoperating classes can be concurrently used by a client. Each invocation should have its own log file. The log file is provided by the client. p  pI want to p  ul liphave a separate log file per invocation of the systempli lipeach invocation should log to its own log file, but not to otherspli lipThe system itself has some concurrent executionspli lipThe client might concurrently invoke the system multiple timespli ul  pI can set the log file programmatically, similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7824620logbacksetlogfilenameprogramaticallyLogback  set log file name programaticallya. p  h2Problemh2  pIf the system is invoked twice, then the strongfirst log file is still boundstrong to the file appender, which results in the strongsecond invocation writing to both log filesstrong. I can call codedetachAndStopAllAppenderscode on the logger, but this causes a potentially concurrent invocation to lose its file appender. p  h3When adding a new File Appender without detaching previously attached appendersh3  pSubsequent log statements are written to the new file aswell as previously attached files. p  h3When detaching File Appenders and then attaching the new File Appenderh3  pAn already running system now logs to the new log file instead of the actual log file. p  h2Problem Originh2  pIf I am not mistaken, the origin of the problem is the static codeLoggerfactorycode, i.e., because the system obtains the logger by calling codeLoggerFactory.getLoggergetClasscode, the same logger is returned by different invocations. Is there a nonstatic equivalent to the codeLoggerFactorycode Or how would I solve the problem otherwise p  h2Ugly Solutionh2  pWhile writing an MWE I came up with an ugly solution that seems to be working. However, this solution requires synchronizing each logging call, detaching the old appender, attaching the new appender, and performing the actual logging.

Negative 3626 pIm experiencing a memory leak in my application and it seems to originate from CALayer. It looks as though it only affects old iPads I see the problem with iPad 1 amp 2, but iPad Air is ok. I have a crash report from an iPad 1 showing that my app was jettisoned due to insufficient memory, this leak is my main suspect. p  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pDuring operation setNeedsDisplay is continuously called every 40ms by the network thread on various UIViews to update their visuals, see function below.p  precode voidsetNeedsRepaint      [self performSelectorOnMainThreadselectorsetNeedsDisplay withObjectnil waitUntilDoneNO]  codepre  pSimulating iPad2 and using the allocations instrument, I see that every time setNeedsDisplay is called the malloc 64 reference count permanently rises. The responsible library is libdispatch.dylib and the caller is dispatchcontinuationallocfromheap.p  pThe iPad Air simulator doesnt show this issue, in this case the malloc 32 reference count only temporarily rises.p  pI am seeing the malloc 64 reference count rise even on occasions  where setNeedsDisplay originates in the GUI thread and isnt dispatched via performSelectorOnMainThread.p  pBelow is a screen shot of the allocations instrument. The malloc marked 3 is the leak in question. The mallocs marked 1 amp 2 leak much slower, but are still a slight concern.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNKQXe.png altAllocations instrument screen shotp  pstrongSteps takenstrongp  pTo rule out a memory leak in drawRect I commented out all the code between the braces, but the leaked memory still continues to accumulate. p  pIf I dont override the drawRect method I dont see the leak, but I need to in order to draw and update my view. Nor do I see it if setNeedsDisplay is not called, I can call a dummy function instead via performSelectorOnMainThread with no memory leak.p  pIve tried using blocks and dispatchasync instead of performSelectorOnMainThread to run setNeedsDisplay on the GUI thread.p  pI also tried reducing the app down so that setNeedsDisplay is only repeatedly called on a single view. Then removing all pointers to that view so ARC cleans it up in the hope that the stray mallocs might get cleaned up with it.p  pIve tried setting the CALayer contents directly instead of calling setNeedsDisplay. It renders, but the malloc count rises in exactly the same way.p  precodeself.layer.contents  bridge id dummyCGImageRef codepre  pAfter reading a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16229759rapidheapgrowthwithgrandcentraldispatchthisa I thought the leak maybe due to the queue becoming swamped. However, slowing the rate of my function call by 10 just made the memory leak grow 10x slower.p  pstrongConclusionsstrongp  pThe leak really seems tied to CALayer rather than the dispatch queue and performSelectorOnMainThread. It looks like this issue is fixed in later iPads, but I still need a workaround for older models.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  pHas anyone got any tips for debugging thisp  pIs another instrument better suited to finding the exact causep  pIs this a peculiarity of the simulator and what Im seeing isnt the reason my app is jettisoningp  pAnyone know whats causing this Is this an historic bug since it doesnt affect iPad Airp  pI there a subclassing trick I could do with CALayer to prevent the backing store allocating memory, or another way I update my view visualsp  pThanks.p

Negative 3626 pI would like to create a jdbc connection pool from the command line  doing it through the browser all the time is driving me crazy as it is such a tedious process.

Negative 3626 pI am trying to create an application using the MVVM Light framework that will work with WPF 4.54.5.1 and perhaps future Windows 8.1 and with Xamarin.Forms 1.3.p  pI am trying to create two solutions  they will share a Model and ViewModel project thinking PCL but will implement their own UI in Xamarin.Forms and WPF.  Im hoping to be able to databind to properties and commands in both solutions.  This would enable me to create one enginebackend for the app, but be able to implement a Windows 78, iOS and Android version Windows Phone is not required.p  pI am struggling finding the correct NuGet package with the MVVM Light libraries that will compile both in Visual Studio for the WPF side and the other solution in Xamarin Studio on the Mac for the iOS and Android side.  One group will be doing the WPF work and another the iOSAndroid work and a third the services, so Id like to be able to share the PCLModels project with a WebAPI project.  I can get the shared Models project to work, but Im having issues finding the right PCLProfilePackage combination to work for this scenario.p  pHas anyone gotten something like this to work between Xamarin.Forms, WPF and MVVM Light 5p

Negative 3626 pI am using nginx to proxy to a unicorn upstream running a Ruby on Rails application. I want to be able to limit the total amount of the backend resources a singe user IP address can consume. By backend resources, I mean the number of active requests a user can have running on the upstream unicorn processes at once. p  pSo for example, if an IP address already has 2 writing connections to a particular upstream, I want any further requests to be queued by nginx, until one of the previously open connections is complete. Note that I dont want requests to be dropped  they should just wait until the number of writing connections drops below 2 for the user.p  pThis way, I can ensure that even if one user attempts many requests for a very time consuming action, they dont consume all of the available upstream unicorn workers, and some unicorn workers are still available to service other users.p  pIt seems like ngxhttplimitconnmodule might be able to do this, but the documentation is not clear enough for me to be sure.p  pAnother way to think about the problem is that I want to protect against DoS but not DDoS, i.e. I only care about DoS from one IP at a time, by making the server appear to any one IP address as if it has the ability to process N simultaneous requests. But in reality the server can process 10N requests, but I am limiting the simultaneous requests from any one IP to 110th of the servers real capacity. Just like a normal server behaves, when the number of simultaneous workers is exceeded requests are queued until previous requests have completed.p

Negative 3626 pI just wanted to know that can we override the codegetViewcode method in a class that extends the codeCursorAdaptercode classThe unimplemented method in the codeCursorAdaptercode class are codenewViewcode to inflate a codeViewcode and codebindViewcode to bind the data from the data source to the codeViewcode.But the problem is that we cannot save the codeViewcode inside the codenewViewcode method and therefore it runs codegarbage collectioncode more often as compared to codegetViewcode where we get a previous instance of the codeViewcode create earlier.So can we override codegetViewcode instead of codenewViewcode in the class that extends codeCursorAdaptercode And if we can,do we need to call it ourselves every time or would the compiler would do it for us Code is

Negative 3626 pSo I need to be able to consistently have users uploading 3,000 to 4,000 images at a time. Currently using dropzonejs, which works fine for around 1,0002,000 images, but higher than that and I start to have issues. The images are 2MB in size, get resized client side to 300KB, then sent to the server. Resizing server side is not currently an option, so Im not sure what else I can do. Any ideasp  pEDIT Okay so we seem to have found what may be factoring in to the issue with such high memory usage when adding a large amount of files. The issue seems to be caused by a few simple div statements using some bootstrap classes.p  pEvery 1000 photos added before even starting the upload, is causing an increase of about 400MB in memory.

Negative 3626 pI know there are tons of ways to truncate or add trailing zeroes to your double by using output precision, or converting to strings.p  pBut, is there a way to keep zeroes on the actual double, float, or some other data type that keeps the ending 0. As in .1  .10p  pThe reason being, the zero shows that we know the next digit is a zero. The .1 shows all we know is up to the 1 and not after.p  pOf course I can convert to string, or make a custom class that keeps track of it. I am using a lot of doubles though, and would like to skip some work around like that if it is possible. All I can find is ways to mess with strings and output though. Something like double.precisionx would be nice p  pThanks Timp

Negative 3626 pI have a DataGrid in my view and DataGrid has cells with buttons, which have commands assigned. Now I wish to pass current row object which sits in DataGrid.CurrentItem to command execution logic.p  pMy initial idea was to use CommandParameter with value converter, where converter would take DataGrid as parameter and extract required information from DataGrid into my own class  in such way I would avoid reference to DataGrid from my view model. p  pProblem is, that CommandParameter bindingvalue conversion is executed when grid is shown, meaning that there is no selected item yet.p  pCan I somehow avoid bringing DataGrid reference into my command execution logic, like deffer CommandParameter resolution until Command is performed or something like thatp  pUpdate I need CurrentItem and CurrentColumn, Ive realized, that CurrentItem might be accessible through binding of SelectedItem, so to avoid receiving answers with proposing use SelectedItem property.p

Negative 3626 pI have an odd error after a recent update to the Spring STS platform. The project I am talking about is a Spring roo project. Roo generates ITDs for all roo entities. These generated methods are stored in AspectJ files .aj.p  pEarlier my quick fix and autocomplete used to recognize the methods in the .aj files, however after the update, autocomplete does not give the aspect methods and also it keeps showing the red wiggly line.p  pHowever the Markers tab shows no error, and the project which is on Build Automatically deploys and runs perfectly. I also tried creating an intentional error, and it was immediately caught by the auto build and the error showed up on the markers tab. So I conclude that the project is fine, and the compiler is able to compile fine, no issue with dependencies or such. So it might be an configuration issue which I am unable to locate or sort out. Will appreciate help on this.p

Negative 3626 pI need to draw a text onto the screen using a canvas. I want to use the canvas.drawText method but I dont know how to limit the space the text drawn to a confined width and height. The x and y position that are passed in the canvas.drawText are no problem to determine. I was thinking of recursively changing the font size until it fits within the bounds that I want. There is a problem with this though and that it can fit within the height size but not the width or vice versa. Isnt there a way to rescale the canvas.drawText so that it can fit within the width and height I wantp

Something likep  precodeAxiom polyaxiom A  Set A gt nat. codepre  pBut Coq refused to accept such a polymorphic axiom.

Negative 3626 pI have a solution that contains an ngrepeat within another ngrepeat. I use this to create two tables with both static content and dynamic content. At first load the scroll doesnt work. Once you resize the page with the content, the scroll works fine.

It will be a htmlangular jscss front end making REST calls to a WEB api controller. The controller will interact with a registration model that will use a multi tenant database.

Negative 3626 pI am using a for loop to go through an array of strings. For each string, I am finding a new value for it.

Negative 3626 pMy page loads all necessary data from the server at startup via AJAX. This includes users language settings, various classifiers, some business data etc.p  pThe problem I am facing is that when the user first comes to the page, all these different AJAX calls are kicked off at the same time. This means that on the server side, most of them are assigned different JSESSIONIDs I am using Spring on Tomcat 8 without any complex configuration. As a result, some of the data is initialized on the server side in one session, but the browser might end up using a different session in the end and does not have access to the data set up by earlier ajax calls.p  pI wanted to solve this by using a fast synchronous AJAX call in the very beginning so that after it returns and gets a JSESSIONID, all subsequent calls would be made in this original session.p  precode.ajaxapilanguage,      type GET,      cache false,     async false,     success functiondata           do stuff        more AJAX calls codepre  pIt works, but I get warning messages that synchronized XMLHttpRequest on main thread is deprecated. Now  I understand the reasons why such a synchronized call is bad for UI in general, but what other options are there available for me if I want to force all AJAX calls to use the same server side session p  pI can achieve the same result by using a callback and just placing all the rest of my page initialization code in there, executing it in the success section of the first AJAX call, but that wouldnt that have exactly the same effect as synchronizing on mainp

Negative 3626 pI have a situation similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4405336howtocopycontentsofonecanvastoanothercanvaslocallythis question about copying data between canvasesa, but in my case I think Im running into issues with the canvas engine itself and Id like some understandingguidance on what I might be doing wrong. p  pIm creating an offscreen canvas with the same width and height as the onscreen canvas. p  precode  offscreenCanvas  document.createElementcanvas     assign same dimensions as onscreen canvas   offscreenCanvas.width   canvas.width   offscreenCanvas.height  canvas.height codepre  pThen Im drawing from the offscreen canvas to the onscreen one like thisp  precode grab the width and height of the canvas  width, height   canvasElement  x, y   offset   copy image from layer into canvas context.drawImage    offscreenContext.canvas, x, y, width, height, x, y, width, height codepre  pThe offset is also the argument into a function which translates the live canvas context before all this drawing takes place. p  precodecontext.save context.translateoffset.x,offset.y renderer.drawworld, offset context.restore codepre  pIn other words were trying to grab the section of the offscreen context that corresponds to the translated offset of the onscreen context. p  pThis has some issues.
