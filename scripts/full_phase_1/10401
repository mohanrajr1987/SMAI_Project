Negative 10401 pIve built an analytical data visualization engine for Canvas and have been requested to add tooltiplike hover over data elements to display detailed metrics for the data point under the cursor.p  pFor simple bar amp Gaant charts, tree graphs and node maps with simple square areas or specific points of interest, I was able to implement this by overlaying absolutelypositioned DIVs with hover attributes, but there are some more complicated visualizations such as pie charts and a traffic flow rendering which has hundreds of separate areas defined by bezeir curves.  p  pIs is possible to somehow attach an overlay, or trigger an event when the user mouses over a specific closed path  p  pEach area for which hover needs to be specified is defined as followsp  precodecontext.beginPath context.moveTosegmentRight, prevTop context.bezierCurveTosegmentRight, prevTop, segmentLeft, thisTop, segmentLeft, thisTop context.lineTosegmentLeft, thisBottom context.bezierCurveTosegmentLeft, thisBottom, segmentRight, prevBottom, segmentRight, prevBottom    ...define additional segments...    ltdreamgt Ideally I would like to attach to events on each path context.setMouseoverfunctionShow hover content  ltdreamgt context.closePath codepre  pBinding to an object like this is almost trivial to implement in Flash or Silverlight, since but the current Canvas implementation has the advantage of directly using our existing Javascript API and integrating with other Ajax elements, we are hoping to avoid putting Flash into the mix.p  pAny ideasp
Negative 10401 pWere building a custom output display dialog.  In it we display thumbnails bitmaps in a listbox. There is also a larger, detail view which is a GDI vector image retrieved from PrintPreviewEventArgs PreviewPrintController and displayed in a WindowsFormsHostPictureBox.   The thumbnail bitmaps are created from the original GDI image, so it would appear that the image did contain the text at some point.p  pAll is fine on a 32bit box. When we run the app on a 64bit machine we build targeting an x86 platform so were running in the 32bit emulator, the thumbnails are fine, but the main image is missing all text.  The graphic elements  lines, table borders and background colors, etc are rendered, but no text. p  pAny ideas Thanks.p

Negative 10401 pIm trying to train an ANN I use this library a hrefhttpleenissen.dkfann relnofollowhttpleenissen.dkfanna  and the results are somewhat puzzling  basically if I run the trained network on the same data used for training, the output is not what specified in the training set, but some random number. p  pFor example, the first entry in the training file is something likep  precode88.757004 88.757004 104.487999 138.156006 100.556000 86.309998 86.788002  1 codepre  pwith the first line being the input values and the second line is the desired output neurons value. But when I feed the exact same data to the trained network, I get different results on each train attempt, and they are quite different from 1, e.g.p  precodeMax epochs   500000. Desired error 0.0010000000. Epochs            1. Current error 0.0686412785. Bit fail 24. Epochs          842. Current error 0.0008697828.

Bit fail 24. Epochs          472. Current error 0.0009952184. Bit fail 0. my test result 0.001642 codepre  pI realize that the training set size may be inadequate I only have about a 100 inputoutput pairs so far, but shouldnt at least the training data trigger the right output value The same code works fine for the getting started XOR function described at the FANNs website Ive already used up my 1 link limitp
Negative 10401 pMe and some peers are working on a game Rigs ofRods and are trying to integrate OpenCL for physics calculation. At the same time we are trying to do some much needed cleanup of our data structures. I guess I should say we are trying to cleanup our data structures and be mindful of OpenCL requirements.p  pOne of the problems with using open CL is the inability to use pointers as the memory space is different. From what little I know of OpenCL is copies all the data onto the GPU then performs the calculations, pointer values would be copied but the address would not correspond to the expected address.p  pThe data in question is centralized in an array, when objects need to that data they use pointers to the object it needs, or stores an array index.p  pOne solution to account for OpenCL is to use array index instead of pointers. This leads to hard coupling that could lead to headaches later on.  As a solution I had the idea of calculating the array index based on the address of the start and the address of the current. This of course would only work with a continuous array.p  pI wrote a sample app to test this and it worked just fine, some people verified it on different platforms as well. p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  typedef struct beamt   unsigned int item  beamt  define GLOBALSTATICASSERTexpr, msg      extern char STATICASSERTIONmsg[1]    extern char STATICASSERTIONmsg[expr12]   ifdef amd64 typedef unsigned long pointerint else typedef unsigned int pointerint endif GLOBALSTATICASSERTsizeofpointerint  sizeofpointerint, integersize define MAXBEAM 5   int main    beamt beams[MAXBEAM]  beamt beamstart  ampbeams[0]  beamt beamptr  NULL   stdcout ltlt beams  ltlt ampbeams ltlt n   for pointerint i  0 i lt MAXBEAM i      beamptr  ampbeams[i]   pointerint diff  pointerintbeamptr  pointerintbeamstart   stdcout ltlt beams[ ltlt i ltlt ]  ltlt beamptr       ltlt t calculated index ltlt  diff  sizeofbeamt       ltlt n    return 0  codepre  pIm concerned that this more of a kludge than a bonified solution.  Im aware that this would not work no nonconinuous memory.p  pbasically my questions are thisbr What would be the pitfalls for using this approach in known coninuous memorybr How would you be able to tell it was continuous br What approaches have people used when dealing with this type of issuep  pThanks, and my appologies if the formating is off, this is my first time posting a question.p

Negative 10401 pIm evaluating a number of different algorithms whose job is to predict the probability of an event occurring.p  pI am testing the algorithms on largeish datasets.  I measure their effectiveness using Root Mean Squared Error, which is the square root of the sum of the errors squared.  The error is the difference between the predicted probability a floating point value between 0 and 1 and the actual outcome either 0.0 or 1.0.p  pSo I know the RMSE, and also the number of samples that the algorithm was tested on.p  pThe problem is that sometimes the RMSE values are quite close to eachother, and I need a way to determine whether the difference between them is just chance, or if it represents an actual difference in performance.p  pIdeally, for a given pair of RMSE values, Id like to know what the probability is that one is really better than the other, so that I can use this probability as a threshold of significance.p

Negative 10401 pIm having a Firefoxspecific issue with a script I wrote to create 3d layouts. p  pThe correct behavior is that the script pulls the backgroundcolor from an element and then uses that color to draw on the canvas.

When the user mouses out, the color ishouldi revert back to nonhover color. p  pThis works as expected in Webkit browsers and Opera, but it seems like Firefox doesnt update the backgroundcolor in CSS immediately after a mouseout event occurs, so the current backgroundcolor doesnt get drawn if a mouseout occurs and it isnt followed up by another event that calls the draw routine.

Plan B is to mock one using UIButtons, and here is where Im having problems. p  pBasically, when I press a button that should push a new view, it calls the push method, but I still see the top view.p  pin the app delegate, I have something like p  blockquote   pAppViewController viewControllerbr   App1ViewController app1ViewControllerbr   UINavigationController navControllerp blockquote  pand in didFinishLaunching method, something likep  blockquote   pviewController  [ [ AppViewController alloc ] initWithAppDelegate self ]br   app1ViewController  [ [App1ViewController alloc ] initWithAppDelegate self ]br   navController  [ [ UINavigationController alloc ] initWithRootViewControllerviewController]br   [window addSubviewviewController.view]p blockquote  pand 2 methodsp  blockquote   pvoidapp1[ navController pushViewController app1ViewController animatedYES ]br   voidback[ navController popViewControllerAnimatedYES ]p blockquote  pthen I have 2 viewcontrollers in AppViewController.hp  blockquote   pinterface AppViewController  UIViewController br   UINavigationController navControllerbr   UIButton appbtn1, appbtn2, appbtn3, appbtn4br   br   idinitWithAppDelegateidappDelegatebr   endbr   interface App1ViewController  UIViewController br   UITextView textViewbr   UINavigationController navControllerbr   br   idinitWithAppDelegateidappDelegatebr   endp blockquote  pand define a loadView for each viewcontroller.  However, when I press the app1 button and the app1 method gets called, it says the view hasa been pushed, but my view remains the buttons view, i.e. the root view.  If I press the button again, it tells me I cant repush the app1view, the one I cant see.  Any ideas  I can post the full code if that helps.p  pThank you for your time.p

Negative 10401 pI have a query string with a parameter value that contains the norwegian character codecode encoded as codee5code. The page contains a form with an action attribute which is automatically filled by ASP.Net. When the URL is output into said attribute it is printed with a full two byte encoding codeu00e5code. p  pWhen posting back this seems to be ok when debugging the code behind. However the page actually does a redirect to itself for some other reason and the redirect location header looks like this  codeLocation myFolderMyPage.aspxParam1C3A5code  p  pSo the codee5code has been translated to codeC3A5code which breaks the output somehow.p  pIn HTML text the broken characters look like codeamp195amp165code after having been output via HttpUtility.HtmlEncode.p  pThe entire web application is ISO88591 encoded.p  pPS. When removing the u00 from the output codeu00e5code in the action attribute before posting the form, everything is output nicely. But the error seems to be the translation from codee5code to codeC3A5code. And of course the self redirect, but thats another matter.p  pAny pointersp

Negative 10401 pI am looking for realistic examples of immutable classes developed in Java. In order to allow finding those classes which are intended to be immutable, it would be helpful if the code used an codeImmutablecode annotation, or otherwise documented classes as intended to be immutable. I also need to be able to study the source code of those classes, so a project with any read only license is suitable.p  pIn regards to the codeImmutablecode annotation used, it doesnt matter emwhichem codeImmutablecode it is. So whether the annotation is from JSR305 or FindBugs, or inhouse, etc., it doesnt matter, just that the simple name of the annotation is Immutable. Similarly, if the project uses a emconsistentem way of marking classes as immutable class name convention, javadoc, marker interfaces, etc. such that I can search the codebase and tell a mutable class from an immutable one, this is also what Im looking for.p  pAre there any examples of opensource code containing extensive examples of immutable classesp

Negative 10401 pI have an MVC application for our intranet which uses NTLM authentication however I want to be able to allow external users to access the application. All external connections to our intranet come via a NAT and therefore have a single IP address which can be used to denote if the request is external or not. I want all internal users to undergo NTLM authentication as they already do but any connection coming from the external IP to automatically get anonymous authentication anonymous being any potential default user eg the standard Network Service or IUSR account, a specified domain user severely locked down for other purposes of course etc. The result being no one should see a password request unless internal and having a browser that does use NTLM by default.p  pI know usually mixed mode authentication is awkward at best but I was wondering if this specific use case might have some other way round the problem. Some of the possibilities Ive considered arep  ol liIntercepting the requests before they get to the WindowsAuthenticationModule, either in IIS, one of the events in global.asax or an HTTPHandler, so that we can inject authentication for a designated user.li liAt the NAT is there a way to inject NTLM headers in the HTTP Request for a designated user.li liAs the external users get to it via a different host the DNS is handled at their end to fit in with their naming conventions get IIS to serve a simple proxy site that takes a request, forwards the request to the main website using NTLM of a designated user then sends the response back to the original requester.li ol

Negative 10401 pWhen I started my current job, I spent a year in ClearCase hell. Everything was kind of like Mordor in winter, only without the laughs. Then we started using Mercurial.

Can you please suggest the best quality checkerp  pI am doing a nonvoice process PDF to MS word conversion process.  We all know that checking this output with PDF is a quite time consuming task. I came to know that there is an automatic checker which checks the contents in the PDF and Word and generates an error report for the converted work done. If you need further information, please visit  a hrefhttpthebinarycomputer.comSpellCheck.html relnofollowthebinarycomputer.comSpellCheck.htmla. The software at that link is not effective I need better software than this.p  pKhallas Spellchecking Softwarep  pOVERVIEWp  pThis Software is able to compare between Image PDF  JPG  TIF or Other Type file amp Word file. It can compare more than one file at a time. It is not necessary to check your Word file manually with Image file at the time of converting Image file into Word file using any OCR technology. Our software can detect error from word file as per your image file. And also it is able to do Auto Correction. This is fully automatic in nature. At the same time it shows original Image file, original Word file along with zoomed Image Highlighted portion. This shows error with different color at the time of compare between Image file and Word file. Accordingly, we can take decision easily. p  pADVANTAGESp  precode Ensure Your Accuracy level  Save Your Time  Save Your Labor  Save Your Money  Less Your Tension  Enjoy With Your Family Member codepre  pFEATUREp  precode Word File will be compared with Image File.  Word Files content will be 100 same as per Image File.  Automatic update is possible.  In Table, content will be checked Cell by Cell.  Able to remove automatically any junk character.  If you miss any character, word, line, and paragraph, or if any word written twice, it will be detected and autocorrected.  It can check Single Line Equation or Multi Line Equation AZ  09 but it can not check any Scientific Equation or Scientific Character, just show it as error.  Automatically Detect Error Case error, Bold error, Italics error, Comma [,], Full stop [.], Semicolon [], Colon [], Optional hyphen [], Super script, Sub script and any Special Character. codepre

The slowdown is negligible, but it is enough for WPF to be refreshed so it is even better than sleeping before each notification.p  pI am all ears for real solutions, not some tricks.p  pstrongRemarksstrongp  pemRemark on giving up with databinding  for me the design of it is broken, in WPF you have single channel of communication, you cannot bind directly to the source of the change. The databinding filters the source based on name string. This requires some computation even if you use some clever structure to keep all the strings.emp  pEdit emRemark on abstractions  call me old timer, but I started learning computer convinced, that computers should help humans. Repetitive tasks are domain of computers, not humans. No matter how you call it  MVVM, abstractions, interface, single inheritance, if you write the same code, over and over, and you dont have way to automatize the things you do, you use broken tool. So for example lambdas are great less work for me but single inheritance is not more work for me, data binding as an idea is great less work but the need of proxy layer for strongEVERYstrong library I bind to is broken idea because it requires a lot of work.emp

Negative 10401 pIs there an easy way or a module in Drupal to distinguish between anonymous users who have never created an account versus those who are returning but are not currently logged inp  pFor nonreturning ie, completely new users, Id like to have a front page that is very streamlined and focused on registration as the calltoaction. However, if someone is a returning user but not currently logged in, Id like to present a lot more information on the front page and have login as the main calltoaction. I realize both pages would still need to have both login and register options available, I just want to make the focus significantly different between the two.p

Negative 10401 pIm working on a very highlevel domain specific language that deals with data analysis.  There is virtual uniform agreement that onebased indexing is the way to go from a scientific perspective. Of course programmers hate this mismatch, but virtually all our users are used to using x[i] to denote the element i not element i1.p  pAre there any design principles that can be used to preserve some sane interoperability story with the CLR  My sense was that if we automatically translate System.Collections space with onebased variants, along with our C based APIs we should be 90 of the way there. But Im not sure.  For instance, should we automatically rebase the IList interface  But what happens then if the C API implements CustomRemovezeroBasedIndexp  pIs there anything else we can do to ease this painful mismatch  How far should we go in making System.Collections one based.p  pFinally, are there any examples of onebased languages on the CLRp
Negative 10401 pI have a data warehouse based on Postgresql. p  pUntil now, I have been trying to run queries on a database containing just a fraction of my real database. Once I have written the queries in a way that make them efficient for this small test database I run the queries on the real one. p  pThe problem is that once I run the queries on the real database, the real database runs out of memory and starts writing things like indexes and temp tables to disk. This means that it could be that different queries would be optimal for for test database and the real database. Does this mean that I really have to run queries that take several minutes to complete in order to know, which query is the optimal one.p

Negative 10401 pI am trying to figure out an elegant way to share a variable between a windows form app and a python script running in the background.  The variable would be used solely to update a progress bar in the windows form based on the the long running process in the python script.  More specifically, a windows timer will fire every strongemnemstrong seconds, check the variable, then update the progress bar value.  Sound stupid enough yet  Ill try to explain the need for this below.p  pI have a windows app that lets a user define a number of parameters to fire off a long running process python script.  Without getting into unnecessary detail, this long running process will insert many 100k records into a sqlite database over a significant period of time.  In order to make the python script as performant as possible, I dont call commit on the sqlite database until the very end of the python script.  Trying to query the sqlite database from the windows app via System.Data.Sqlite before the commit occurs always yields 0 records, regardless of far along the process is.p  pThe windows app will know how many total records will be inserted by the python process, so determining progress will be straightforward enough, assuming I can get access to a record count in the python script.  p  pI know I could do this with a text file, but is there any better wayp

I wanted to hear alternative ways that doesnt include me reproducing the app repeatedly. Even if you feel that MS Visual Studio with C is the best way, Id like to receive that answer. p  pstrongQuestion 2 Day 2strongp  pDo I have to create an actual functional app on the backend if I am only demonstrating a prototype of the app so that I can sell the intellectual property In other words, I can create the front end to simulate data being storedretrieved and so forth without actually doing it. But is that how the business works Ive never done this before and I am seeking aide, maybe possible hiring help if I can find the right people for the right price. So Day 2 question is not only a question, but a job offer The prototype I am creating is very simple. It consists of 2 icons, 1 page, and 1 menu with 5 actions. I can simulate all the menu actions, but actually doing the actions legit, I dont have the experience. I am only 2 days into programming I could use some help, and there is pay if anyone would be so gracious. Please email me at portfoliobuilder.com if you would like more information. I know I can sell the intellectual property if I can build the prototype, so pay will definately happen.

People who have signed up on a website that I will build can use their user name and password to log into the phone app.p  pStep 2 That login screen then displays icons. One to start, but I am hoping to build more icons. What the icons represent arent important, I just need to know if I can make a transition from a login screen view step 1 to a blank screen with an icon view step 2p  pStep 3 Ok, these next steps is where things get foggy for me. When you click this icon a menu bar comes up with the options purchase, transactions, clear, help, close on it. I think by now you understand what I want to create maybep  pStep 4 People should be able to perform the actions in the menu. Upon clicking purchase, a secure  message needs to be sent to my server, thereafter, the senders location should be verified meaning where they are currently when they click purchase, does that match where they said they lived when they created their user name in step 1, their identity should also be verified and then the purchasing process should take place debt stored value account. Item registration occurs at the store operator by secure severs, and then another notification should be displayed indicating the completion of purchasing the item. p  pAlthough I am fairly certain that the front end is easy to develop, its the backend I have questions about. And what I mean by backend, I mean verifying location, age and identity of the purchaser. If you know a good way of doing this I would love to hear it. Ive heard that every phone is uniquely registered to each individual, so is there some way I can pull age and location from the phone What I mean is, if you attempt to purchase my item and your phone is registered to BOB who is 11 years old, but to make the purchase of my item you need to be 18 years old can I somehow use the registered phone info and this software to check his age And since people use different phones and so forth, is that even a practical method of doing that I still believe that setting up a login system where you create an ID under license agreement that you are 18 years old is the best way. That way if you have an account, then you claimed you are 18 and if you lied, then that isnt my fault right And as far as locations go, I am assuming I can just use google GPS APIs to just confirm where BOB isp  pLast but not least, I am seeking help with creating this app. I dont care if it can be created with appcelerator or any other framework. I know when it comes to app developers its all about costs, but the developing of this app would have to be for free at first. The app will not be sold to an app store, it will be used as a prototype so that I can sell the IP. With that said, you will get paid, just not in the beginning.

Negative 10401 pI am looking for an unusual c container library for use in a scheduling search algorithm. The search algorithm evaluates solutions identified by different permutations and looking for the best solution it can find. As part of the algorithm it needs to remember previously visited solutions so it can avoid ending up in a circular loop. Hence I need a container which is indexed by a permutation. The permutation is an array of size N holding the values 0 through to N1 in a random order.p  pThe container only needs to store a Boolean indicating the location has been visited. It needs to be a quick lookup, it needs to make efficient use of memory.p  pI suspect a tree may be optimal ... But only if there is an existing library as this issue is also constrained by my available time to implement it.p  pBest regardsp
Negative 10401 pIm working on a tower defense game and I want the defending turrets to shoot at the attacking unit thats farthest along the path within its range.  Im programming it in java and using ArrayLists for holding the units.p  pSo far I have the path broken up into different blocks that each have a list of units in them.  As a unit leaves the block it gets passed to the next block on the path.  If the units all moved at the same speed it would be easy to keep track of which unit is farthest because it would be the first in the list.  But Id like the units to be able to move at different speeds.p  pWhen a unit is added to a block it gets added to the end of the arraylist.  So the units that were added earlier are at the front of the list and the units that were recently added are at the end of the list.p  pMy original idea was to have each unit check the units lower than it in the arraylist to see if theyre farther along the path.  If they are it would move down the arraylist to the correct spot.  This kind of seems like a lot additional work for the blocks to do and Im afraid it will slow down the game alot.p  pIs this a good idea or should I try something else  I can post some of the code if it would help.p

Negative 10401 pIve got a bunch of stateful functions inside a State monad.

But in order to call them from the toplevel function I need something akin to a lift, but Im not trying to lift a value from the inner monad. Rather I want to convert the state in the StateT monad into something equivalent in the State monad. To do this Ive got the followingp  precodewrapST  State Sometype a gt StateT Sometype IO a wrapST f  do s lt get               let r,s2  runState f s                put s2               return r codepre  pThis then get used to interleave things like the followingp  precodetoplevel  do liftIO  Some IO functions               wrapST  Some state mutations               liftIO  More IO functions               .... codepre  pIt seems like a fairly obvious block of code so Im wondering does this function have a standard name, and it is already implemented somewhere in the standard libraries Ive tried to keep the description simple but obviously this extends to pulling one transformer out of a stack, converting the wrapped value to the cousin of the transformer type, skipping the monads below in the stack, and then pushing the results back in at the end.p

Negative 10401 pI am trying to export a spreadsheet to a specific xml layout to be imported into a pdf form. I have gotten pretty far on my own but am stuck at what seems to be near the end. Mind you, I am not very proficient with programing stuff, and my experience with XMLXSLT is limited to this projectp  pFirst, I exported an example set of data from the pdf, which gave me an idea of what I am looking for. I then imported this into Excel and got a spreadsheet from the data. This let me edit the data easily, then theoretically export it back, but...Excel wouldnt export the XML map that it created on import due to a lists of lists problem. This led me to putting the speadsheet into OpenOffice technically LibreOffice and trying an XML export filter using XSLT. p  pMy data in the spreadsheet looks like...p  precodeType    Name    Compound    Weight  Material    Weight AAA     BBB         X           5       s         2 AAA     BBB         X           5       t         3 AAA     BBB         Y           4       r         4 codepre  pI need it to be exported as like...p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8 gt   ltMCD TypeAAA NameBBBgt    ltProduct CompoundXgt      ltAmount weight5gt      ltHM Materialsgt       ltAmount weight2 gt       ltHMgt     ltHM Materialtgt       ltAmount weight3 gt      ltHMgt     ltProductgt    ltProduct CompoundYgt      ltAmount weight4gt      ltHM Materialrgt       ltAmount weight4 gt       ltHMgt     ltProductgt    ltMCDgt codepre  pBut with my current XSL, I get something more like...p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8 gt   ltMCD TypeAAA NameBBBgt    ltProduct CompoundXgt      ltAmount weight5gt      ltHM Materialsgt       ltAmount weight2 gt       ltHMgt     ltProductgt    ltMCDgt  ltMCD TypeAAA NameBBBgt    ltProduct CompoundXgt     ltHM Materialtgt       ltAmount weight3 gt      ltHMgt     ltProductgt    ltMCDgt  ltMCD TypeAAA NameBBBgt    ltProduct CompoundYgt      ltAmount weight4gt      ltHM Materialrgt       ltAmount weight4 gt       ltHMgt     ltProductgt    ltMCDgt codepre  pMy problem lies with each cell of the spreadsheet being in the output. I want to have the parent cell only be deiplayed when it changes, like in a folder tree. I hope this makes sense and someone can help me either making it work in excel or openoffice, though from my search it seems the OpenOffice route is more likely.

Obviously, enforcing these rules within the software design is a matter of implementation.p  pWhat Im wondering is this in the event that a rigid cardinality model is required by the business domain, what is the best way to enforce it The techniques I can think of off hand include the followingp  ul lipstrongBidirectional referencesstrong  Bidirectional associations between associated objects object A references object B and object B references object Ap  precodeclass Warehouse    private ListltItemgt items    public void RegisterItemItem obj      ifobj.Warehouse  null       throw new ArgumentExceptionCan only register unowned item      items.Addobj     obj.Warehouse  this     codepreli lipstrongEncapsulate the owned entitystrong  let the owner control its creation and deletion and provide access through a set of APIs that abstract the actual entity implementation object A clones a passed in entity B or creates an entity B based on a passed schematicp  precodeclass Warehouse    private ListltItemgt items    public void RegisterItemItem obj      items.AddItemobj.Clone       public void RegisterItemItemDescriptor item      items.Addnew Itemitem     codepreli lipstrongThird party monitorstrong  Have some third party that understands cardinality constraints create and hookup object associations appropriately object C knows about the relationship between A and B and is responsible for creating and maintaining it  this method is only available to C and not available to clientsp  precodeclass Warehouse    private ListltItemgt items    internal void RegisterItemItem obj      items.Addobj                class WarehouseItemRegistrationService     private ListltItemgt registeredItems    public void RegisterItemWarehouse warehouse, Item item      ifregisteredItems.Containsitem       throw new ArgumentExceptionCan only register unowned items      warehouse.RegisterItemitem     codepreli ul  pI think each technique has its strengths and weaknesses. emBidirectional associationsem can add complexity to the object graph and require private APIs for updating references yet it is very simple to implement and embeds the business constraints in the business entity classes. emEncapsulating the owned entityem can complicate the domain model by forcing entities to have a value based description, yet it is very clean. emThe third party monitorem technique isolates explicit cardinality enforcements to a separate class, but it also complicates the domain model.p  pDoes anyone have any other thoughts, ideas, or better approachesp

Negative 10401 pIve seen several JMeter threads that kind of touch on my issue, but none seem to address my specific problem.  p  pThe problem is  the website that I am testing, works like thisp  ol liA homepage with logon fields, and a submit button.  When you first browse to this page in a browser, a PHPSESSID cookie is set comes down in the Response Header with a unique Value, to identify the session.li liWhen the user clicks on the login button username and password on this page are irrelevant in the systems current state, the web server redirects to a different server running LDAP, via shibboleth. Shibboleth needs the value of the PHPSESSID cookie, to proceed. to validate that the user is coming from a correct, federated server.li liThe user then enters their account username and password, and clicks the login button.li liThe valid account is logged in to the LDAP server if the account did not exist on the original 1 server, then shibboleth maps the LDAP fields over to the account database on the original server. Then the user is logged in to the original server 1 to the newlycreated account, and redirected to the original page.li ol  pTheres some other SAML data thats exchanged  which I dont think is going to be a problem. . . so far, the problem seems to be this cookie.p  pWhere JMeter is falling down, is in step 2.p  ul liIf I do not set a cookie manager, the LDAP server says that I do not have cookies enabled. this error is in the response data.li liIf I set the HTTP cookie manager, with no PHPSESSID cookie specified, the LDAP server says that I do not have cookies enabled. it does not matter which Cookie Policy I set it toli liIf I specify the PHPSESSID cookie value  of course, each user needs to have an unique value, so this will be wrong. . .  So I set a RegExp post processor for the initial page, to extract the PHPSESSID value from the Request Header, and place it into a variable PHPSession Then I specify a value, in HTTP Cookie Manager, for the PHPSESSID cookie, of PHPSession . . . and LITERALLY, in the header, the emem thing submits a Cookie PHPSESSIDPHPSessionli ul  pSo then, I read THIS. . .  a hrefhttpsissues.apache.orgbugzillashowbug.cgiid28715 relnofollowhttpsissues.apache.orgbugzillashowbug.cgiid28715ap  pWhich says, in effect, paraphrased ...cookie manager doesnt expand user variables... then ... okay, we fixed it... it does expand user variables... then ... well, no, not in THAT field, its not designed to do THAT. p  blockquote   blockquote     blockquote       pSo... basically, theyre saying, HTTP Cookie Manager can not manage session cookies that have an unique value for each user. even though, this is what I thought its whole purpose was. p     blockquote   blockquote blockquote  pHow else can I set and submit a unique cookie for each user whose value is extracted from the first Response Headerp
Negative 10401 pIve been debugging a C program of mine, and after several fruitless spans of time, discovered the error came from accidentally passing an array by reference instead of by value.p  pHeres some pseudocodep  precode1st pass currentVertices  levels[0].vertices    currentVertices[0].Position.Z  10  2nd pass currentVertices  levels[1].vertices currentVertices[0].Position.Z  10  3rd pass currentVertices  levels[0].vertices currentVertices[0].Position.Z  10    currentVertices[0].Position.Z is now 10 less than expected 20 less than it started. Further loops will increase the difference in expected value. codepre  pI was not expecting to have passed the Array by reference, but I accidentally did so anyway.p  pIs there a way to assign an array by emvalueem instead of by reference I know that I could iterate through both arrays, assigning each term individually, but that seems unnecessarily complex. Im reasonably sure that the Clone function, well, clones, the values without the respective references, but is that the only way to assign by value I.e. codecurrentVertices  levels[1].vertices.Clonecodep  pIsnt Clone generally discouraged Whats the best practice for passing arrays by valuep  pIn the short term, Ive simply hardcoded what the values should be after being loaded.p  pa hrefhttpchat.stackexchange.comtranscriptmessage25707752570775As one of my moderator friends remarked,a p  blockquote   pI see you solved passbyreference through bypassreference.p blockquote

Negative 10401 pI am writing a simple WPF quiz application for a family member and he would like users of this application to have the option to send him their scores once they have completed the quiz. I was hoping to do this without the need to create some kind of webservice for the app to talk back to.p  pMy initial idea was to email the results back, but that runs into problems. What if there is no SMTP client on the users machine I dont want to embed a password for a public smtp server into the application. I could do a codeProcess.Startmailto...code, but that requires their machine to have a handler for mailto and for them to click submit on the generated email.p  pAnother idea I had was that the app could add a line into a Google docs spreadsheet, but that would mean a google docs password would need to be embedded in the app.p  pSo my question is, without me writing a separate application running on a webserver for my WPF app to talk to, is there a good way of my app sending data back to me that doesnt require a password Im guessing there must be some kind of public webservice I could use for thisp

I looked this up and tried setting codeNSSortDescriptor highScoreDescriptor  nilcode but then I get a warning saying that highScoreDescriptor Type Specifier Missing, default to int which in this case is ok, but is not so ok for the Date object in the next descriptor. Turns out I am also getting an error saying that I am redefining highSoreDescriptor with a different type.p  pAlso, is there a list somewhere of what selectors are available I doubt that codelocalizedCaseInsensitiveComparecode is what I want to use since the first property highScore is an int and the second dateCreated is a date.

Is that correctp  pLastly, if I say codeascendingNOcode is that the same as descending I would guess that it is, but one never knows with programming, does onep  pDo I wrap all of this code in its own method Or can I until later just plunk it in the code where I am laying out the tablep  pThis project is not ARC.p

Negative 10401 pAs part of a project I am working on we are designing a web application that contains two components.

The second component is a web application written in php that runs on the web server so the client can remotely view the data pushed by the C application.p  pMy question is, what would be the best way to go about sharing the string resource files between both applications We desire this behavior because many terms appear across both the c application and the user interface of the web page.p

Negative 10401 pi am making an app where ill have a tableview with an add button in the navigation bar, and this add button creates a new row, but the problem is i cant figure out how to give rows unique names. To let the user decide the name, i have included an alert with a plain text field. The user should then write the name in the field and the new row will then be called that. But how do i do that I have used the tableview template provided in Xcode, which give each row a new name according to the clock they added a new row. Ill just want a alert to pop up first and then let the user type the name for the new row.p

Negative 10401 pIn my app an NSArray is created to store various results from a library search. The idea is that each NSArray of results should also be stored locally so that if the search is made again in the future the local results are retrieved.p  pNow, Ive been thinking about two different approaches. The first is to simply make an array in the second view controller that stores the different results arrays. The second is to instead make a class called Search for example that has an NSArray attribute to store the results. This object would be initiated in the second view controller which would then add it to its own array. p  pDoes this make sense In terms of memory management is one better than the other Also, Ill need to use the delegate function to get the data across to the second view controller, right  Thanksp

Negative 10401 pPicture a piece of metal bar, 20mm long, about 30mm round.  On the bar, there is numbers stamped.  10 characters, 4.5mm high, spread around approximately 120 of the circumference.p  pI need to perform OCR on the characters BUT the text characters are not all visible in one image.  Three images spaced at around 30 seems to look ok.p  pNext issue is the metal is freshly machined and the text characters do not seem to OCR well I think due to the lack of real contrast. ie blackwhite difference.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas on how these characters could be OCRd p

Negative 10401 pI use a subclass of NSOperation to upload large files to AWS S3 using Amazons iOS SDK v1.3.2. This all works fine, but some beta testers experience deadlocks iOS 5.1.1. The result is that the NSOperationQueue in which the operations are scheduled is blocked as only one operation is allowed to run at one time. The problem is that I cannot reproduce the issue whereas the beta testers experience this problem every single time.p  pThe operation is quite complex due to how the AWS iOS SDK works. However, the problem is not related to the AWS iOS SDK as far as I know based on my testing. The operations main method is pasted below.

Negative 10401 pi have a problem to read out the internal gyroscope of the iphone correctly.p  pI had developed a augmented reality engine based on the magnetometer. Because the gyroscope gives more reliable values than the magnetometer, i wanted to improve the engine.p  pnow, the problem is, that the gyroscope values, in reference to north, work well if the iphone is in landscape mode. But if i move the iphone between landscape and portrait, the values are wrong. i tryed to calculate a offset based on the accelerometer, but it still dont work correctly. the second problem ist, if the iphone is in portrait mode and i roll it backwards, the compass data makes a jump of 180 degrees.p  precodemmanager.deviceMotionUpdateInterval  160.0 mmanager.accelerometerUpdateInterval  1.090.0 [mmanager startDeviceMotionUpdatesUsingReferenceFrameCMAttitudeReferenceFrameXTrueNorthZVertical]   queue to get accelation data NSOperationQueue motionQueue  [[NSOperationQueue alloc] init] [mmanager startAccelerometerUpdatesToQueue motionQueue withHandlerCMAccelerometerData data, NSError error      xacc  data.acceleration.x  0.1  xacc  1.0  0.1     yacc  data.acceleration.y  0.1  yacc  1.0  0.1     zacc  data.acceleration.z  0.1  zacc  1.0  0.1 ]    in my update method double gyx  mmanager.deviceMotion.attitude.yaw double gyy  mmanager.deviceMotion.attitude.roll double gyz  mmanager.deviceMotion.attitude.pitch   sidewise rotation of the iphone to calculate a offset double rotation  fmodatan2yacc, xaccMPI2180MPI180, 360  heading with compass data and offset just work perfectly double compassheding  fmodlmanager.heading.trueHeadingrotaion, 360   double gyroheading  gyx180MPI90  ifgyroheading lt 0     gyroheading  gyroheading360    same offset as obove. but wont work correctly. double ro2  fmodatan2yacc, xaccMPI2180MPI180, 360 head  fmodheadro2, 360 codepre  pMy question is now, how can i read out the gyroscope with north reference correctly and calculate the offset, so the vaues are still correct, when having the iphone in front of my eyes, like making a photo.

Negative 10401 pI am getting inconsistent results when using JavaScripts RegEx to validate numbers with a decimal place.

Negative 10401 pI am currently developing a service using Java and Spring MVC where users can upload video files. These can later be retrieved through our API. p  pWhen the video file is loaded through our API we just send the file completely, as a download, there is no streaming or multiparting.

Negative 10401 pIm trying to develop a system in PHP that can generate JS classes, and I have an implementation that works.  The problem Im running into surrounds multiple inclusion of these JS classes my code will print out the JS class every time its needed, and I want it to print out only the first time.p  pMy current solution to this problems is inelegant it requires the PHP class developer to explicitly call a function which will check if the JS class has yet been included.  e.g.p  precodepublic function getJSClass   Call Parent js  parentgetJSClass   Add Current Class if thisgtclassNeededSearchAndManageDataManipulator      js .           Class SearchAndManageDataManipulator                    Base class for applications which feature a search and results control           as the central element of the application.  Such applications generally           specialize in handling multiple records at once.                   function SearchAndManageDataManipulator                ...                   SearchAndManageDataManipulator.inheritsDMWindowedDataManipulator         Return return js  codepre  pId like to isolate this checking from the class developer, to make it something like the followingp  precodepublic function getJSClass  return           Class SearchAndManageDataManipulator                    Base class for applications which feature a search and results control           as the central element of the application.  Such applications generally           specialize in handling multiple records at once.                   function SearchAndManageDataManipulator                ...                   SearchAndManageDataManipulator.inheritsDMWindowedDataManipulator       codepre  pSo, Id like to create a function which calls getJSClass iff the class is needed, as well as any parent getJSClasses the function will need the name of the class, to check if it has already been included.  That class name is set by overriding another function, jsClassName however calling jsClassName will always return the class name of the class lowest in the class heirarchy, because its the latest overridden version of the function.p  pIf a parent class is calling getJSClass, I need it to be able to check if the class name in jsClassName has been included yet.  But it cant be the version of jsClassName which has been overridden for the lowest class, it needs to be the version defined in the parent class.p  pIs there any way to access the current class version of a function  By current, I mean the class in which the current function was defined.  That way, as we move up the parent chain, jsClassName will reflect the class name in question.p

Negative 10401 pSo I recently decided that for a fun little pet programming project, I would design my own language and build tools around it compiler, autodoc, autolint. So far, Im still on the language design stage, and I came across a topic that Im kind of stuck on Should keywords be uppercased p  pBy keywords, I dont mean built in types or functions, I mean the words like FOR IF ELSE, etc. My logic behind using it would be that its much faster to recognize the code structure and syntax, especially if syntax highlighting werent available some places it still isnt, such as print sources or websites. The majority of time is spent reading code, so it would make sense to increase efficiency of the reading of code, at the cost of having to press caps lock twice per keyword, or hold down shift while typing them. Whats everyones opinion herep  pAlso, I know its just a silly petproject, but I want it to be done right, Im a bit of a perfectionist. And I also plan on using it myself just to play around, while continuing its optimizationdevelopment learning purposes of course. So I dont to make decisions Ill regret or have to break all my previous code or possibly even compiler for. p  pThank you in advance.p  pEDIT And because its only used on major keywords like that, it would also avoid the cognitive slowdown of reading uppercase and keep the code from SCREAMING to much.p
Negative 10401 h2In shorth2  pIs it possible set up an RServer that can handledispatch multiple client requests in an strongasynchronousstrong way p  pI guess Im looking for some sort of socket communication. Or is there something even more efficient to let R talk to other applications p  pNow, I dont really care if the communication is eventually realized via plainvanilla socket communication something like codesocketConnectionport6011, serverTRUEcode for the server process, codesocketConnectionhostSys.info[nodename], port6011code for client processes in combination with codewriteLinescode and codereadLinescode of JSON characterstrings or something more advanced like using web server facilities based on HTTP requests.p  h2More detailsh2  pFirst of My background with respect to those nittygritty informatics details is all DIY, so things like emsocket communicationem, details about emmasterserver conceptsem or emasynchronous communicationem etc. are pretty new to me. So please dont bite p  pId like one of my processes to act as an RServer. AFAIU, R was not designed under a multithreadingparadigm. So I wonder how I can make my RServer handle concurrent client requests currently coming from a third party software that sends its requestsobjects via JSONstyle character strings in an strongasynchronousstrong way.p  pIn plain english I would like to tell my server process something like thisp  blockquote   blockquote     pOnce you get an incoming message at port xy, do what you need to do but emimmediatelyem switch back to responsive mode to be able to handle the next client request and always take care that each client gets the results that is logically linked to its respective request.p   blockquote blockquote  h2Homeworkh2  pI started out with something very basicp  precodecon lt socketConnectionportas.numericport, serverTRUE codepre  pThis would make my R process become a server. It works a treat, but since codeconcode is my only connection object, the server is doomed to handle each client request sequentially p  blockquote   blockquote     pRead the input from the connection, do some calculations, write output back to the connection and only strongthenstrong handle the next client request.p   blockquote blockquote  pI thought about have my server process immediately dispatch everything that needs to be done to an strongauxiliary Rscript processstrong so that the main server process is ready to take the next request. But since at the end of the day the results need to pass through codeconcode again in my main server process, I think that doesnt really get me any points as the server process still needs to wait until the auxiliary process is finished before taking the next request. Or can I tell this auxiliary process to directly report back to the client request somehowp  pEven though Im currently not aiming at turning my server into a fullgrown web server, these sophisticated web server approaches seemed very promising to me at a first glancep  ul lia hrefhttpwww.rforge.netRserve relnofollowRServea a hrefhttpcran.rproject.orgwebpackagesRserveindex.html relnofollowCRAN pageali lia hrefhttpjeffreyhorner.tumblr.compost25035081768rooktutorialatuser2012 relnofollowRooka a hrefhttpcran.rproject.orgwebpackagesRookindex.html relnofollowCRAN pageali ul  pIs asynchronous clientcommunication possible with one of thesep  pAny pointer whatsoever will be stronggreatlystrong appreciatedp  hr  h2EDITh2  pstrongIll offer a bounty of 300 credits once the question is eligible.strongp

Negative 10401 pI have this little dependency injection container which I instantiate likep  precodeservices  new Services codepre  pand if I need to add parameters to it I just dop  precodeservicesgtsetParametername, value codepre  pand I pass this instance of codeservicescode through the constructors of some my objects and if I need something like the database handle I just go codethisgtservicesgtgetServicedbcode and it returns an instance of the database handle and if I call that method again later it will return the same instance of the database handle it did earlier.p  pThe thing I want to know is are dependency injection containers only for single instance objects like your codedbh, config, user, authcode objectsp  pFor example, I need to create multiple instances of a codeProductscode class but if I gop  precodeservicesgtsetParameterproduct.id, productId product[]  servicesgtgetServiceproduct codepre  pIt will obviously create a new instance of codeProductcode but then if I repeat that code again it will just give me back the same instance as earlier, I can obviously modify the codegetServicecode method a bit so that it can return as many new instances as I need but is that using a DIC for something its not made forp  pSo basically should a DIC only return single instances of a class like codedbh, user etccode and not be creating objects like codeOrders, Products, Invoicescode p

Negative 10401 pIm having a problem with KVO exceptions being thrown if I attempt to prefetch related entities in Core Data.  It doesnt make any sense to me and I cant seem to duplicate the behavior in a simplified project.  Im targeting 10.8 and using ARC.p  pMy data models a music library and I have three entities of interest codeTrackcode, codeArtistcode, and codeAlbumcode.  A track has a single artist and a single album, while an album has a single artist.  My codeAlbumcode and codeArtistcode objects are uniqued by name only one artist with a given name in the store.p  pI want to display a list of tracks with the following fields title, artist.name, album.title.  This is easily accomplished using an NSArrayController for the codeTrackcode entity and bindings in an NSTableView.p  pHowever, since I know that I will be using the artist and album relationships I would like to prefetch them when the tracks are loaded.  I created an NSArrayController subclass with a custom performFetch method that looks like thisp  precode BOOL fetchWithRequestNSFetchRequest fetchRequest mergeBOOLmerge errorNSError autoreleasing error      NSEntityDescription entityDescription  [Track entityInManagedObjectContext[self managedObjectContext]]     fetchRequest  [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init]     [fetchRequest setEntityentityDescription]     [fetchRequest setRelationshipKeyPathsForPrefetching[album, artist]]      return [super fetchWithRequestfetchRequest mergemerge errorerror]  codepre  pI set the NSArrayControllers class in IB to my subclass and I expected that the UI lag would disappear faults were firing with each scroll.  However, an exception is thrownp  blockquote   p20130101 104806.965 XXX[10593303] Cannot update for   observer  for the key path artist.name   from , most likely because the value for the key   artist has changed without an appropriate KVO notification being   sent. Check the KVOcompliance of the Track class.p blockquote  pBefore the custom codeNSArrayControllercode subclass everything worked correctly.  By simply commenting out the codesetRelationshipKeyPathsForPrefetchingcode line in my codeNSArrayControllercode subclass everything works again.  I cant determine what the link is between prefetching and KVO.  Have any Core Data experts seen something like this beforep

Negative 10401 pIs there any useful hook in ASP.NET MVC MVC4 which can let you access the Action method parameter View model before the action method becomes invoked, and then also e.g. depending on the value of something you checked in the action method parameter let you prevent the action method from being invoked, i.e. instead either forward the view model object action method parameter to another action method or directly to some view i.e. without any further processing in an action method p  pIf you do not understand the question, please see the code example below which should illustrate the kind of code I am looking for...  though I do not know if there actually exists such kind of interface and a possibility to hook an implementation into the MVC frameworkp  pIf this is indeed possible, I would like to see an answer with code example about how to do it and not just a response with someone claiming that e.g. try using method ActionFilterAttribute.OnActionExecuting or IModelBinder.BindModel  because I have already tried those and could not make it work.

Negative 10401 pIve googled a lot and read as much as I can on the subject but I cannot find a direct answer to my question anywhere including here.  My ZF2 application consists of roughly 7 different modules.  5 of the modules will need access to the same database configuration.  The application itself has a database with roughly 124 different tables.  So the idea here is to find the proper solution to write the least amount of code considering the setup.p  pWhat Im trying to do is create a specific class to interface with the DB.  Where the business logic is kept in the Module and note the controllers to keep everything more abstract and easier to maintain.  By that I mean controller X should be able to create a new instance of for instance ApplicationModelDBInterface and use the models functions to do inserts deletes updates joins selects and so forth.  The reason I would like to do it this way is so that all modules installed can use the same interface without having to write endless DI statements everywhere.  So what I will need is an example of how I can get the configuration for the DB currently inside module.config.php  local.phpusername  pw to be passed to the ApplicationModelDBInterface dbConfig variable, and perhaps even an instance of the dbAdapter initialized from config if possible.p  pAlternatively I could potentially grab the configuration from the ApplicationModelDBInterface if such a way exists.p  pIf neither of the above is possible then I can always go back to the old way of doing things by reading an ini file for the db details and instantiating my db adapter that way.p  pPlease keep in mind that I wont be injecting anything in the controllers as the controllers just emuseem db  new ApplicationModelDBInterface so injecting into the controllers doesnt make much sense at all.p  pIs there a better way to do this  optimized  am I doing it completely wrong  Anyone able to share some details please.  Ive spent way too much time on this already and definitely need help.p

Negative 10401 pI understand deferred execution in LINQ as explained here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7324033whatarethebenefitsofadeferredexecutioninlinqWhat are the benefits of a Deferred Execution in LINQap  pHowever, deferred execution can lead to bugs especially in multithreaded scenarios eg. evaluation performed on a shared collection outside of a lock.  When a method that returns a deferred evaluation is nested several method layers deep, it can get really hard at least for me to remember or keep track of such that I lock appropriately.  p  pOmitting special cases like infinite sequences eg. Fibonacci and also assuming the filtering of the collection is deemed complete ie. it is not likely that the consumer would filter the results further, what would be considered the best approach when returning a collection of IEnumerable from a method  should it already be evaluated or deferred  p  pNote best approach can be defined in terms of efficiencycode safety of some other measure, just verify in your response.  I would like to know how the community does this.  p  pFollowon question  does it make sense to explicitly state in the method name if the result is evaluated or deferredp

Negative 10401 pCan anyone show me how to control javas order of execution while still organizing the code in a simplified, easytomaintain structurep  pI am programming a rather complicated algorithm in java.  One method got to be several hundred lines long, to the point where isolating critical parts of the code for fine tuning the algorithm became too laborintensive.  To simplify the code, I identified each section of the code that could be resolved to a single variable, and I moved each of those sections to their own methods, which are then called from the formerly complicated method.  This is good, because it makes the code readable, and much easier to maintain.  p  pThe problem is that now I am getting some errors that indicate that the calling method is continuing to execute subsequent code before some of the earlier methods have returned their values.  p  pHere is an example in code  p  precodevoid myMethodDouble numb       double first  new getFirstnumb       double second  new getSecondnumb       double third  new getThirdnumb       double anAside  new getAnAsidefirst, second, third       double fourth  new getFourthnumb    codepre  pThe error messages that come up have to do with things happening in codegetFourthnumbcode at the same time when I am getting codeSystem.out.printlncode results in the eclipse console indicating that codegetFirstnumbcode is still running.  Back when I had all the contents of codegetFirstnumbcode, codegetSecondnumbcode, codegetThirdnumbcode, codegetAnAsidefirst,second,thirdcode, and codegetFourthnumbcode within codemyMethodnumbcode, I was not getting the same evidence that code blocks were running out of order.  Because their were no submethods, the code was all in one long block.  However, the code was difficult to read.  How can I make changes to codemyMethodnumbcode above so that each method must be fully returned before moving on to the next, so that I can still have easy to read codep

Negative 10401 pI have a jqGrid subGrid using subGridRowExpanded. For each grid row, the subgrid contains 7 rows. Initially when a grid row is expanded, the subgrid retrieves the 7 rows of data using ajax. If I update one of the 7 rows within the subgrid and click on save, I use ajax to save all 7 rows to the server and I use editRow to save the 7 rows to the subgrid. p  pHere is the problem. If I close this subGrid and reopen it again, the 7 rows in the subGrid are filled with the data from the original load without any changes. The only way around this is to set cachefalse in the ajax call. p  pIs there a way to update the cache when I update the row using editRow key  true to saveRow instead of going back to the server again by turning off the cache  p  pThanks.p

Negative 10401 pAfter updating VS2012 to Update 2 and seeing my unit tests stuck in pending mode when running them with ReSharper, I downloaded version 7.1.3 as recommended and could once again run my tests. A few weeks after that, I downloaded TFS Express just to play around with it and see how it worked. Today, after deciding its not beneficial for me to keep it on my local machine anymore, I uninstalled it. Suddenly, until tests would no longer run. I reinstalled it, and as if by magic, my unit tests ran again.p  pDoes anyone know what TFS and VS2012 have in common regarding unit testing What couldve happened during uninstallation that was fixed with a reinstall And even more importantly, what did TFS Express change in VS2012s handling of unit testing Any insight would be much appreciated as I couldnt find much detail on the web...p

Where I am getting stuck is trying to determine focal length and distance to the display surfacep  pReferred to as the Viewers Position e [x,y,z] in this article a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwiki3DprojectionPerspectiveprojection relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwiki3DprojectionPerspectiveprojectionap  pIve also been referring to this article as well  httpwww.shotlink.comTourWebTemplateshotlinknew.nsf2c47cc31e412bc4985256e6e00287832c1743b40acf6aa03852575b7007122b0FILEPlotting203D20ShotLink20Data20on202D20Images.pdf which extracts the focal length from the field of view, which appears to be know beforehand, but is not in my case.p  pSo I guess my question then is, is there a way I can work in reverse to determine focal length andor field of view based on the position of the known points on my image  Or am I looking at this the wrong way and maybe there is an easier way to accomplish the end goalp

Essentially, the goal of this query is to fetch all coordinate points in the table that are currently in the viewport of a Google Maps window which is bounded by the 4 coordinates in the query. p  pIve limited the zoom level where this query is run with the Google Maps API, so that the maximum amount of rows that can be fetched is strong5600strong. As the zoom level increases, the resultant fetch total decreases significantly. p  pRunning such an example query directly in PHPMyAdmin takes 1.401.45 seconds. This is far too long. Im already running standard indices on coderefcoordlatcode and coderefcoordlongcode which brought the query time down from 5 seconds, but this is still much too large for a map where an end user expects a timely response. p  pMy question is simply How can I further optimize this tablequery to increase the speed at which results are fetched p

Negative 10401 pI have a UICollection view which implements the didSelectItemAtIndexPath... method. When the cell is selected tapped, a transition is made to another view controller. However, each cell also contains a vertical scroll view. Id like the user to have the option of interacting with each cell to either swipe vertically to see the contents of the scroll view, or tap once to select the cell. p  pMy first thought was to add two gesture recognizers to the cell, one for swiping and one for tapping, but I am not sure if it is a good idea to start adding more gesture recognizers to a UICollectionView and scrollview.

Negative 10401 pI have about 50 projects in version control for which I am standardizing the way that they are structured and built.p  pEach has a build.xml in its root folder. We also have a project in which there is a build file that gets imported by the other projects in order to do common tasks. This makes maintenance of these common tasks much easier.p  pSVN Repositories for each project adhere to svn standard root structure of trunktagsbranches. Our workspaces are built in RAD by checking out from trunk. When rad then builds the project structure there is no actual trunk directory created on the filesystem. Projects simply begin in workspaceRootprojectName, without the trunk. Although the infomation about where the project was checked out from is in brackets after the project name, so you know what branch of the repository you are working on.p  pWe support both FileExport style war creation in RAD and explicit build.xml creation of the war file as well. All of this is working just peachy.p  pNow starting to get these projects building nightly in Jenkins and struggling with some of the file structure differences between the RAD environment and the Jenkins Environment.p  pFor instance, if I have a specific project I am working on, say project1, the build.xml location in my workspace will be p  precodeworkspaceRootproject1build.xml codepre  pThe common build.xml file similarly will be at p  precodeworkspaceRootcommonProjectbuild.xml codepre  pSo project1 will attempt to import that build file with p  precode ltimport filebasedir..commonProjectbuild.xmlgt codepre  pIn Jenkins however when I specify the repository location and it does its checkout it goes to p  precodejenkinsRootworkspacejobNameproject1trunkbuild.xml  codepre  pand similarly the common project build.xml is atp  precodejenkinsRootworkspacejobNamecommonProjecttrunkbuild.xml codepre  pSo the syntax in the project1 build file to import the common build file will not work. I have other similar issues, all related to differences in file structure.p  pIt seems this must be a fairly common issue, is there an best practice approach to addressing problems such as this. I have done a deal of searching around with no luck thus far.p  pWould be nice, for instance, if Jenkins could check out the trunk in the same way as RAD, but it does not seem that it can. This at least would allow me to use an ant available tag to look for the two possible trunk locations and use the correct one as appropriate. But one has a trunk and one does not. Jenkins includes the jobName in the workspace path, while obviously RAD has no such concept ... and so on. Would like a clean way of putting together a build process that works seamlessly whether launched from Rad or Jenkins.p  pJimp

But if I set the property in the JmsRollbackSequence it has absolutely no effect  I tried it first before using the sequence shown below. The transaction is never rolled back. The rollback works only if the property is set in the inSequence.

Negative 10401 pwhat is the best way of creating a table which can hold a key to a lot of other tables As far as I know I have two optionsbr 1 I create a table with a lot of foreign key fieldsbr 2 I create two fields, one which indicates the referenced table and another field which holds the primary key of that table.brp  pThe latter has a lot of issues due to the fact theres no way to maintain referential integrity because theres no foreign key to each table.brp  pBesides a link to this table I want to add a description so I can show all notifications in a grid.

I believe the math says 21 integertype attributes would go over the limit, and that is before I even start adding varchar, text, and decimal attributes. p  pSo the solution I came up with was to use subqueries to overcome the 61 table limit. p  pOne way to do it is to group the joins in subqueries of 61 joins. And then all of the groups would be joined. I think I can figure out what the sql queries should look like, but it seems difficult to write the code to generate the queries. There is a further albeit theoretical problem in that one could again violate the 61 table limit if there were enough attributes. In other words, if I have 62 groups of 61 tables, there will be a MySQL error. Obviously, one could get around this by then grouping the groups of groups into 61. But that just makes the code even more difficult to write and understand.p  pI think the solution I want is to nest subqueries within subqueries such that each subquery  is using a single join of 2 tables or one table and one subquery. Intuitively, it seems like the code would be easier to write for this kind of query. Unfortunately, thinking about what these queries should look like is making my brain hurt. Thats why I need help.p  pWhat would such a MySQL query look likep

Negative 10401 pI have a wireless mesh network of nodes, each of which is capable of reporting its distance to its neighbors, measured in simplified signal strength to them. The nodes are geographically in 3d space but because of radio interference, the distance between nodes need not be trigonometrically trigonomically consistent. I.e., given nodes A, B and C, the distance between A and B might be 10, between A and C also 10, yet between B and C 100.p  pWhat I want to do is visualize the logical network layout in terms of connectness of nodes, i.e. include the logical distance between nodes in the visual.p  pSo far my research has shown the multidimensional scaling MDS is designed for exactly this sort of thing. Given that my data can be directly expressed as a 2d distance matrix, its even a simpler form of the more general MDS.p  pNow, there seem to be many MDS algorithms, see e.g. a hrefhttphomepage.tudelft.nl19j49MatlabToolboxforDimensionalityReduction.htmlhttphomepage.tudelft.nl19j49MatlabToolboxforDimensionalityReduction.htmla and a hrefhttptapkee.lisitsyn.mehttptapkee.lisitsyn.mea . I need to do this in C and Im hoping I can use a readymade component, i.e. not have to reimplement an algo from a paper. So, I thought this a hrefhttpssites.google.comsitesimpmatrixhttpssites.google.comsitesimpmatrixa would be the ticket. And it works, butp  ul lipThe layout is not stable, i.e. every time the algorithm is rerun, the position of the nodes changes see differences between image 1 and 2 below  this is from having been run twice, without any further changes. This is due to the initialization matrix which contains the initial location of each node, which the algorithm then iteratively corrects that is passed to this algorithm  I pass an empty one and then the implementation derives a random one. In general, the layout does approach the layout I expected from the given input data. Furthermore, between different runs, the direction of nodes clockwise or counterclockwise can change. See image 3 below.pli lipThe solution I thought was obvious, was to pass a stable default initialization matrix. But when I put all nodes initially in the same place, theyre not moved at all when I put them on one axis node 0 at 0,0  node 1 at 1,0  node 2 at 2,0 etc., they are moved along that axis only. see image 4 below. The relative distances between them are OK, though.pli ul  pSo it seems like this algorithm only changes distance between nodes, but doesnt change their location.p  pThanks for reading this far  my questions are Id be happy to get just one or a few of them answered as each of them might give me a clue as to what direction to continue inp  ul liWhere can I find more information on the properties of each of the many MDS algorithmsli liIs there an algorithm that derives the complete location of each node in a network, without having to pass an initial position for each nodeli liIs there a solid way to estimate the location of each point so that the algorithm can then correctly scale the distance between them I have no geographic location of each of these nodes, that is the whole point of this exercise.li liAre there any algorithms to keep the angle at which the network is derived constant between runsli ul  pIf all else fails, my next option is going to be to use the algorithm I mentioned above, increase the number of iterations to keep the variability between runs at around a few pixels Id have to experiment with how many iterations that would take, then rotate each node around node 0 to, for example, align nodes 0 and 1 on a horizontal line from left to right that way, I would correct the location of the points after their relative distances have been determined by the MDS algorithm. I would have to correct for the order of connected nodes clockwise or counterclockwise around each node as well. This might become hairy quite quickly.p  pObviously Id prefer a stable algorithmic solution  increasing iterations to smooth out the randomness is not very reliable.p  pThanks.p  pEDIT I was referred to cs.stackexchange.com and some comments have been made there for algorithmic suggestions, please see a hrefhttpcs.stackexchange.comquestions18439stablemultidimensionalscalingalgorithmhttpcs.stackexchange.comquestions18439stablemultidimensionalscalingalgorithma .p  pImage 1  with random initialization matrixp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comv4cix.png altImage 1  with random initialization matrixp  pImage 2  after running with same input data, rotated when compared to 1p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeUC1B.png altImage 2  after running with same input data, rotated when compared to 1p  pImage 3  same as previous 2, but nodes 13 are in another directionp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commisSM.png altImage 3  same as previous 2, but nodes 13 are in another directionp  pImage 4  with the initial layout of the nodes on one line, their position on the y axis isnt changedp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeApf3.png altImage 4  with the initial layout of the nodes on one line, their position on the y axis isnt changedp

Negative 10401 pI am creating a custom field type in SharePoint 2013 that is inherited from the SPFieldUser field.

Negative 10401 pI have a very simple php socket server that runs on my machine.  I created a convinience class with simple methods like restart and stop and etc. to control the server once it is already running.p  pWhat the restart function does is it sends the server the command to stop and then it forks the process and starts a new instance of the socket server within the child process while the parent process returns to the caller.  p  pThis works great on the command line, however I am trying to make an admin webpage which restarts the socket server and the forking is causing problems in phpfpm.  Basically, what it appears is happening is that the life of the page loading is not ending when the parent process ends and nginxphpfpm are not reassigning the process to new connections until the forked process also ends.p  pIn my case, I do not want the forked process to ever end, and I end up with a completely debilitated server.  in my test environment, for simplicity i have the worker pool set to only 1, in a production environment this will be higher, but this issue would lead to one worker slot being permanently occupied.p  pI have tried a few things including calling codefastcgifinishrequestcode just prior to the forking, however this had no affect.p  pHow can I restart my service from a phpfpm worker process without locking up an assignment in the nginx connection poolp

The program runs just fine until you are presented with the option of starting again, or of backing out. No matter which option you choose, yes, or no, it takes you back to do a new loop. I know one way to fix this would simply be to rely on a cancel button, but I want to understand why this code isnt returning the values I expect it to, so would be very grateful for your help.p  precodeimport javax.swing.JOptionPane      public class HelloMK2          public static void mainString[] args           for int i  0 i lt 3000 i              double Int1  optiontakeshape             double Int2  optiontakediam             if Int1  1.0                  Shape s1  new CircleInt2                 infoBoxs1.area2d              else                  Shape s1  new SphereInt2                 infoBoxs1.volume                          int yesno  repeat             if yesno  1                  System.out.printlnyesno                 break                                 public static int repeat          int j         int g  JOptionPane.YESNOOPTION         JOptionPane.showConfirmDialognull, Would you like to begin again,                 Repeat, g         if g  JOptionPane.NOOPTION              j  1             System.exit0          else if g  JOptionPane.YESOPTION              j  2          else              j  3             System.exit0                  System.out.printlnj         return j          ...  codepre  pstrongEDITstrong Thank you for the many swift responses.

Negative 10401 pIm using Java Excel API to read data from Excels sheets in my Android project. I have some columns formated as time like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5ehSu.png altTime formatp  pAt first I tried read this cell using that codep  precodeString cellContent  cell.getContents codepre  pBut as result I got content without hours eg 5959. After that I tried get this time as seconds. I noticed that when cell data is get as DateCell, Date contents object has negative timestamp. I did some trick and I found value of timestamp for 00000. I set variable with this value as positive 2209161600000L. Now I just add this variable to negative timestamp from cell and devide result by 1000 milliseconds in second. Everything is fine until 235959. Values above have extra 24 h 240000 is reading as 480000. I saw that Excel keeps this values in different ways.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkcvB7.png alt235959 time cell value img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUAOzO.png alt240000 time cell valuep  pI can just subtract this 24h but it isnt elegant solution. I want to get content as  string which I prefer or as seconds. Is there any good solution for this issuep

Does the code above look fine for a lockfree threadsafe stack What else can I look at This is impossible to debug normally as the errors occur at various places, telling me there is a pointer or RAM corruption happening somewhere. I also get duplicate entries, meaning that a node that was popped of one stack, then later returned to that same stack, is still on top of the old stack... Impossible to happen according to my algorithm This lead me to believe its possible to violate DelphiWindows InterlockedCompareExchange Methods or there is some hidden knowledge I have yet to be revealed.  I also tried TInterlockedp  pI have made a complete test case that can be copied from ftp.true.co.za. In there I run 8 threads doing 400 000 pushpops each and it usually crashes safely due to checksraised exceptions after a few cycles of these tests, sometimes many many test cycles complete before one suddenly crash.p  pAny advice would be appreciated.p  pRegards Anton Ep

So I am puzzled about where to create the list to store the handler objects to be used later.p  pMy code before adding the list is  p  precodeclass WSHandlerAtornado.websocket.WebSocketHandler     def openself         print new connection         self.writemessageHello World      def onmessageself, message         print message received s  message      def oncloseself         print connection closed   class WSHandlerBtornado.websocket.WebSocketHandler     def openself         print new connection         self.writemessageHello World      def onmessageself, message         print message received s  message      def oncloseself         print connection closed  class WSHandlerBtornado.websocket.WebSocketHandler     def openself         print new connection         self.writemessageHello World      def onmessageself, message         print message received s  message      def oncloseself         print connection closed  application  tornado.web.Application[     rA, WSHandlerA,     rB, WSHandlerB,     rC, WSHandlerC, ]   if name  main     httpserver  tornado.httpserver.HTTPServerapplication     httpserver.listen8888     tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.instance.start codepre  pSo where do I create this list and make sure its visible to all the objects created I am new to python as well and so having a little trouble wrapping my head around it.p  pI also realize I could probably use just one URI endpoint and send the multiple commands as part of the message itself. But then I dont want to turn WebSocket into a binary protocol. Given that we have URIs I should be using them.p  pThanks for any help.p

Negative 10401 pAs a means to try and learn object oriented PHP scripting, Im currently attempting to rewrite a database web application that I previously wrote in procedural PHP. The application is used to store car parts and information about car parts.p  pIn my application there are car parts. They are identified by various reference numbers, which are assigned by different organisations the parts manufacturer, remanufacturers, vehicle manufacturers, etc., and any particular car part could have zero, one or many reference numbers as assigned by these organisations and, confusingly, each reference number may refer to more than one unique car part as defined in the database Im working on.p  pAs far as I understand things, I am dealing with three different classes of entities. There is that of the car part, the reference number, and that of the referenceassigner in my internal nomenclature I call these referrers. As I am just getting started with learning OOP, I have begun by creating some very basic classes for each       precodeclass Part      public partid     public parttype     public weight     public notes      public references              private db              function constructDatabase db                  thisgtdb  db                 class Reference      public referenceid     public reference     public referrer             private db              function constructDatabase db                  thisgtdb  db                class Referrer      public referrerid     public referrername             private db              function constructDatabase db                  thisgtdb  db               gt codepre  pWhat Ive been struggling with is how to populate these and subsequently glue them together. The most basic function of my web application is to view a car part, including its metrics and its assigned reference numbers.p  pA codepartidcode is included in a page request. Initially, I wrote a constructor method in my codePartcode class which would look up that part in the database, and then another method which would look up reference numbers which were JOINed with the referrer table assigned to that Part ID. It would iterate through the results and create a new object for each reference, and hold the complete set in an array indexed by the codereferenceidcode datum.p  pAfter further reading, I began to understand that I should use a factory class to carry this out, however, as this kind of conjunction between my codePartcode class and my codeReferencecode class is not the responsibility of any one of those discrete classes. This made conceptual sense, and so I have since devised a class that Ive called codePartReferenceFactorycode, which I understand should be responsible for assembling any kind of collation of part reference numbers       precodeclass PartReferenceFactory       public static function getReferencesDatabase db, partid        dbresult  dbgtquery         SELECT          FROM  .

I will try to distill this into some underlying, directlyanswerable questionsp  ol lipDoes my understanding of the purpose of classes and of factory classes seem erroneouspli lipIs it a bad idea for me to store arrays of objects I ask from a viewpoint more of design than performance, insofar as they are not intertwined.pli lipIs this even an appropriate way to structure relationshipsinterdependencies between classes in PHPpli lipIs it correct to call my codePartReferenceFactorycode inside the codegetReferencescode method of the instantiated codePartcode class And is storing the returned reference objects within the part objects appropriatepli lipAs a part of the applications GUI, Ill need to provide lists of referrers, requiring me to create another array of ALL referrers independently of any part object. Yet some of these referrers will exist within the codereferencescode array inside the part object. It has occurred to me that in order to avoid duplicate referrer objects, I could SELECT a list of all referrers at the beginning of each page request, formulate these into a global array of referrers, and simply reference these from within my codePartcode and codeReferencecode classes as needed. However, I have read that it is not good to rely on the global scope within classes.

Negative 10401 pUsually, when you develop code with Javascript or C, you use CamelCase for your variables to make the code easier to read.p  pHowever, Im a Dynamics CRM 2011 developer, and one of the quirks of Dynamics CRM has to do with field naming. Basically, if you create a field in Dynamics CRM, it saves the name in 2 different formats once with with the casing as you enter it for example newSocialSecurityNumber and once in complete lowercase for example newsocialsecuritynumber.p  pThe tricky part is that depending on the context the name is used, you are forced to use a specific version. For example, in Javascript, if you want to get the value of a field from the form, you use lowercase, BUT if you want to retrieve the value using a webservice, you need to use the version with casing both for the call itself and the return. Similarly, if youre developing in C, depending on whether you use early or late binding, you either use with or without casing.p  pnow, with Early binding, C has Intellisense, and with Late binding, its all lowercase, so thats not that big of a deal, but Javascript has barely any Intellisense related to CRM, and none for field names or webservice related values, so its a lot easier to work with those fields if you always put the names in lowercase.p  pBecause of the need to use both a correctly cased and a lowercased name of the same field, whenever I create a field in CRM, Im writing it in full lowercase. This means that both versions of the name are the same, which makes development easier. However, this is not the recommended naming convention for development in C or Javascript. Is this an acceptable reason to ignore naming conventions What are the disadvantages of ignoring the naming conventions in this casep

Negative 10401 pI am converting a code written on Matlab to C.  In Matlab, there is a function called mvnrnd which is amultivariate normal random number generator.  This requires two inputs n x d mean matrix and dbyd cov matrix.  I googled and found math.net matrixnormal does do the same thing.  p  pUnlike the function in Matlab, matrixnormal  requires three inputs mean matrix M, a cov matrix for the rows V and a cov matrix for the columns K. The documentation states if the dimension of M is dbym then V is dbyd and K is mbym.  I have these two inputs matrices 1x12 mean matrix and 12x12 cov matrixfor Matlab.  I would like to convert these two inputs into three inputs for matrixnormal.  p  pMean matrix part is not a problem but I dont know how to convert cov part.  I am not good at statistics.  Could someone help me to do this  Thanks,    p

Negative 10401 pConsider the following definition of a class in JavaScriptp  precode Car constructor function Carcolor      var hasWheels  true     this.color  color     this.hasWheels  hasWheels  var redCar  new Carred console.logredCar.hasWheels codepre  pIt seems to work because it gives no errors in Firefox and writes codetruecode to the console. However, is this code correct or is JavaScript just too forgiving Netbeans complains that in the Car constructor the variable codehasWheelscode is unused. Also it does not give a hint to codehasWheelscode when I type coderedCar.code. This works properly with the property codecolorcode. So do I have to rename my variable codehasWheelscode to e.g. codehasWheelscode I know that in this simple example I could just set the property codehasWeelscode directly to codetruecode, but this is not the point of my question. So the new code would look likep  precode Car constructor function Carcolor      var hasWheels  true     this.color  color     this.hasWheels  hasWheels  var redCar  new Carred console.logredCar.hasWheels codepre  pThis seems to work fine with NetBeans. However, I rather like to gives the properties and the variables the same name, since they are at the end assigned.

On Android 4.0 however all fonts default to the same default font. p  pBecause we like to target Android 4.0 and higher with our app I am looking for a way to get the Google web fonts working reliably.p  pThe app does little more than opening html files from a server in the web view.p  pUpdate It turns out that some Android 4.2.2 devices do not show Google web fonts correctly. It is not clear what makes these devices stand out from the ones that I tested and where web fonts work correctly. p  pWhat can I do to make web fonts work reliably over different Android versions and devicesp

Negative 10401 pOk so Im kinda new, but have somewhat of an idea of what Im doing, but this one just has me stumped for the past couple hours, so any help is very much appreciated.  Im building a site and have been using Rspec and Capybara to test my site as Im moving along. I ended up needing to remove turbolinks to improve functionality for my jscripts.  The next time I try to run tests, literally 50 of my test suite just magically broke. Ive narrowed it down to that the commonality between all the failures was that the visit either appeared in or just before the code block. So basically removing Turbolinks somehow blew Capybara up or Rspec. Im really having some trouble figuring this one out.  I tried updating the gems, that didnt work. I guess the next step is either skip the TDD concept, which I dont want to do, or start uninstalling the gems and do a reinstall and pray that that doesnt render my app useless...  Any help anyone can provide is much appreciated, and if youre in NYC Ill buy you a beer.  p  pThere are also other tests that are failing that dont require any sort of authentication, just to check the page for title and content and those are failing to.

I want to compile the shared libraries with relative paths for dependencies  i.e., use the codeORIGINcode special variable. p  pHowever, because Python has the codeCAPNETRAWcode capability, Linux treats as a codesetuidcode program and ignores the codeORIGINcode string inside the shared libraries dependencies definitions, a hrefhttpweb.archive.orgweb20041026003725httpwww.caldera.comdevelopersgabi20031217ch5.dynamic.htmlsubstitution relnofollowso they fail to loadap  blockquote   pFor security, the dynamic linker does not allow use of codeORIGINcode substitution sequences for setuser and setgroup ID programs. For such sequences that appear within strings specified by codeDTRUNPATHcode dynamic array entries, the specific search path containing the codeORIGINcode sequence is ignored though other search paths in the same string are processed. codeORIGINcode sequences within a codeDTNEEDEDcode entry or path passed as a parameter to codedlopencode are treated as errors. The same restrictions may be applied to processes that have more than minimal privileges on systems with installed extended security mechanisms.p blockquote  pThis security feature causes us a lot of pain. We have to compile shared libraries will full path dependencies and they are not portable between development machines.p  pIs there any way to disable this security feature in Linux so that codeORIGINcode will be interpreted for programs with extra capabilitiesp

Negative 10401 pSo Ive noticed that all HTML5 music players overlap music if you put on autoplay.p  pIf I do something likep  precodeltaudio srcdemo.mp3 preloadauto autoplay controls loopgtltaudiogt codepre  pItll overlap the music making it sound like theres multiple copies of the music playing on the screen.

Thanks.p  pFurther edit after Stephens comment.. The scenario is in the editing of a User. A user can have a CompanyInstituion Id as part of its model. I wish to present a list of companies to the operator not necessarily the User to allow them to attach a company id to that user. So in concept its dead simple  present a list of companies to pick from. Press a select link on the company line and return to the controller to sort it out. Hence I need to preserve the UserId in the Viewbag  yes I can create a viewmodel if needed but getting the company id alone would be a start.. So thats it.. present the list, select one and return it.. I dont really want to use checkboxes anyway.. I kind of got there after trying some things. I originally had the submit button in the loop before I added the checkbox. I did try putting the Company Id on the button but that didnt work either.p

Negative 10401 pCan anyone recommend a reinforcement learning library or framework that can handle large state spaces by abstracting themp  pIm attempting to implement the intelligence for a small agent in a game world. The agent is represented by a small twowheeled robot that can move forward and backwards, and turn left and right. It has a couple sensors for detecting a boundary on the ground, a couple ultrasonic sensors for detecting objects far away, and a couple bump sensors for detecting contact with an object or opponent. It also can do some simple dead reckoning to estimate its position in the world using its starting position as a reference.

Negative 10401 pIm working on a new project type for Visual Studio but am having a hard time getting the configuration correct.  I understand that .xxproj files which VS uses to describe projects are actually MSBuild files and that VS actually uses MSBuild to compile projectssolutions.p  pIm working on a new project type for VS but the output is not a .Net dllexe in fact it has a different extension entirely.

The problem is that when I compile, VSMSBuild complains that it cant find OutputFile.exe note I tried MSBuild from the command line.p  pI realised that the Python Tools for Visual Studio has a pyproj file extension and is a valid MSBuild configuration file.  When you compile the default python project it strongemdoes notemstrong produce an output exedll.

BUT the problem still remains in such entities as TEST, which can have different parents.p  pAlso, another problem would be when i try to retrieve all TESTS that belong to a PROJECT. so i would have to go UP a tree making more SQL then i would needp  pI need suggestions as to how to see to this problem.p  pThank you.p

Negative 10401 pI hope the title is descriptive enough.  So here is what I want to do and what Ive toyed with.p  pWait, first off, this is an embedded application.  Atmel SAM4L microcontroller, using the Atmel Studio IDE and GCC compilerlinker.p  pRight, I am writing a bootloader, but want to save the bootloader version to the program memory to the end of the allocated space for the bootloader lets say 0x3FF0.  This way the app can also check the bootloader version by just looking at the specific address. At this moment I am busy with a utility for the app to update the bootloader itself, but I dont want the app or the bootloader to update the version at 0x3FF0 with a command or in code, I want it as part of the .bin.hex file, so when I flash the bootloader on, the version is flashed on along with it. So currently I have a define for the bootloader type, major version and minor version which are all in a file globals.h in the project.  Basically I just want to write those 3 bytes to 0x3FF0 when I hit compile.p  pAs I understand theres quite a lot of tricks I can pull with the linker, but have never before played with linker scripts until yesterday, and have been able to do some things with it, but not what I want yet. The project also creates quite an intense linker script, so Im also a bit wary as to where to jump in and dump my three bytes.  I know youre not allowed to move the address pointer back.p  pHere is the linker script generated by the projectp  precode   file     brief Flash Linker script for SAM.

But knowing what has changed stops me.p  pstrongThe current situationstrongp  pRight now, im just strongalwaysstrong deleting it and recreating it with the new content which is, as you may scream right now, highly suboptimal. Here is my code with commentsp  precode voidcompareFriendshipsFromDbNSMutableArrayfriendshipsFromDb andInsertNSMutableArrayfriendshipsOnline     BOOL update  NO  It tells us if there is new stuff     NSUInteger x  0  It helps us compare later.      if [friendshipsFromDb count]  [friendshipsOnline count]         update  YES  The count is different, there MUST be something different, we update.          else         x  [friendshipsOnline count]  same count, but not specifically identical.          im saving that count in x because its the uptodate count.           if x gt 0 ampamp update  NO  This means that the count was identical and that there were friendships to update         forint i  0 i lt x  i              TODO Compare with PREDICATES  I read online that its very powerfuloptimal             This is how I compare right now.

Negative 10401 pIm designing a software that displays various charts, each using a welldefined, chartdependent data. It seems a good idea to create a base class for the data and extend every chartrelated data from it as they have a lot in common. It also seems reasonable to define an abstract base for the charts to handle drawing and some other functions. To reflect the chartdata relation in design, Im using templates code in Javap  precodepublic abstract class ChartData ...   public abstract class ChartltT extends ChartDatagt    public abstract void onNewDataT data    ...    public class ConcreteData extends ChartData ...   public class ConcreteChartltConcreteDatagt    public void onNewDataConcreteData data   ...     ...   codepre  pThis design works pretty well and is flexible enough for my needs. However, Im receiving chart datas from various places like database, network, etc., and for testing purposes, Im willing to create a data factory.p  pIm trying to come up with an idea to makep  ul lia single classli lithat is able to create all classes that extend ChartDatali lithat is flexible so it doesnt break my designli ul  pMy best shot so far was creating an enumeration for the data types and adding a switchcase in a factory method, switching on a parameter. My problem is, having more than 10 classes that extend ChartData, this functions cyclomatic complexity is waaaaay above acceptable and breaks my 3rd rule.p  pThe solution doesnt have to be a single method, but would be nice if it fit in a single class.p

Not ideal, but it solved the speed issue  and interestingly it seemed to empartlyem solve the navigation blocking issue, too.p  pNow it only blocks about half the time. It seems to me that if the page takes less than half a second or so to load, its fine, but if it takes more than that BrowserSync stops it and reloads the current page.br  This explains why disabling the proxy partly fixed it, since with the proxy pages always took around 20s to load.p  pI have tried this in normal Firefox 34, and in a fairly clean install of Firefox Dev Edition 36, with almost no extensions installed.

Negative 10401 pId like to implement a scenario that requires me to know if the user selects an item or deselects everything by clicking on an empty space. Basically, I need to keep the first item which always exists selected. It should be possible to select a different item, but as soon as the user clicks on empty space and when normally selection will be removed it should jump back to the first default item.p  pI tried to employ the selection changed events of the listview control, but those are triggered in a sequence which is not very helpful first the currently selected item loses the selection. Then theres a separate event to indicate that a new item is selected.p  pThe question is when the event ItemSelectionChanged is triggered for the first time to say that a previously selected item is not selected any more, is it possible to know if that item was deselected because another item is being selected or because nothing is selectedp

Negative 10401 pIve noticed that it seems to be common practice at least in web development to not directly include the dependencies needed for projects, but instead only supply a packet manager file which enables everyone to download these dependencies.p  pSo for example, a page is build on several JavaScript libraries, the libraries are often not checked in into version control.p  pWhy is it done like this, what are the advantagesp  pI am always afraid that one time, a crucial dependency is gone for example when the repository gets deleted and it will be really hard to get the project running again, especially when using smaller libraries that arent backed by thousands of people.p  pIs this a legitimate fear or are there ways to avoid something like thisp

Negative 10401 pIve been looking around for a solution to this but couldnt seem to find what I need, most cron jobs I found seem to deal with email alerts.p  pSo here is the scenario, I am setting up a cronjob that needs to go through mysql records and compare the records date modified to the current date, and if it is longer than 90 days, I need to alert the users of my web application. Now the users on the web application would see the alert, than be able to update the record to restart the process.p  pHowever, I am not sure how the alerting system would work.p  pI thought that when going through the records, I could add the ones needing updating to another mysql table, show that table as alerts to the user, and when the user updates the record, I would delete the alert from the table. However, this seems very clunky and inefficient.p  pWhat do you all think would be the best way to accomplish thisp  pAny help is appreciatedp

Negative 10401 pIm working on a project which involves creating a device driver block using simulink and an sfunction builder block. My driver is supposed to make my arduino mega 2560 to periodically send a message to a remote sensor and recieve back the temperature measurement of this sensor.  For the communication between my main arduino and the remote sensors I am using the RF22B 433Mhz transceiver with the Radiohead library a hrefhttpwww.airspayce.commikemarduinoRadioHeadindex.html relnofollowhttpwww.airspayce.commikemarduinoRadioHeadindex.htmla.p  pI tried my script on the arduino IDE and it works perfectly, but it wont execute on simulink.  I have installed the simulink support package for arduino and I made some simple driver blocks which involved blinking LEDs and simple stuff and it did work. However, for the script which uses the Radiohead libaray, even though I debugged all of the errors and simulink says that the model is succesfully deployed to arduino mega 2560, it does not execute.p  pDoes anyone have any hints on why this may be happening Has anyone experienced similar issuesp  pI did some research on this website and many others but I wasnt able to find any similar problems.p  pThanks in advancep

Doing the same in ISE the dialogue pops up directly without any prompt. I thought it was due to the arguments of the method but making them optional by defining a default value did not make a difference. It might be due to how the cmdlet is defined in the PS environment so my question is How can i make it so that running the cmdlet will jump straight to the dialogue Is it possible to define a default value for the Credential parameter to bind to Im guessing this is how ISE gets around this or am i missing somethingp

Negative 10401 pUsing various tutorialsexamplesdocumentationsforums online, I have typed out code to allow CUDA to manipulate OpenGL textures such that it can be outputted to the screen. My method of displaying is to use PBO and an allocated texture image of uchar4 array. Despite all my attempts at fixing the problem, the texture would not show up on the 2D surface. I cannot seem to pinpoint the problem.p  pThese are all the things I have checkeddone thus far I have created a PBO and registered it with CUDA, called cudaGraphicsResourceGetMappedPointer and the unmapping equivalent before and after the GPU function calls, made sure that glEnable is called for 2DTEXTURE, glDisable called for any unnecessary values, unbinded texturesbuffers when not in need. I have also reset SFML OpenGL states in case SFML was the cause. Square textures have also been employed. My OpenGL verision and CUDA version work for all function calls I use.p  pThere did not seem to be any errors within the program when I checked cudaErrors and OpenGL Errors.p  pI am not sure if this has something to do with it but when I callp  precodeglTexParameteriGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREMINFILTER, GLNEAREST glTexParameteriGLTEXTURE2D, GLTEXTUREMAGFILTER, GLNEAREST codepre  pMy quad does not seem to display.p  pI have mainly found inspiration from this a hrefhttpwww.marekfiser.comProjectsConwaysGameofLifeonGPUusingCUDA5Display relnofollowwebsitea.

Negative 10401 pA brief intro to the problem. Ive got a Sass map and Im wanting to reference the keys amp values in that map from emwithin the map itselfem. Im not sure if this is possible, but heres my code, if anyone has any thoughts Id love to hear them.p  hr  pSo Im currently working on tidying up all our colour variables at work, wanting to bring them all into a standard Sass map. The map looks something like thisp  precodemycolors      red  standard c0ffee, dark 0ff1ce ,   green  standard c0ffee, dark mycolorgreen, standard, 10 ,    blue  standard c0ffee, dark 0ff1ce ,  codepre  pIts working as expected, except for the codemycolorcode function call in there. So the codemycolorcode function works as expected, I can parse a colour, an optional variant standarddark amp do an optional adjustment to this colour. My function looks something like thisp  precodefunction mycolor color, variant standard, adjust null      color mapgetmycolors, color    color mapgetcolor, variant    if adjust  color scalecolorcolor, lightness adjust    return color  codepre  pThis can then be called with something like codemycolorgreencode or codemycolorgreen, standard, 10code.p  pHowever as the above codemycolorscode map shows, Im trying to selfreference the map to create variants of colours and keep my code DRY. So for some colours, like coderedcode or codebluecode, I have two specific hex colours from our brand guidelines. But for codegreencode, we just have the standard green. So to make a variant I want to find our standard green, and make it a bit darker. p  pThe simplest fix is to just hard code the hex colours twice, and use Sass codescalecolorcode function. But this would mean our code is no longer DRY. Ultimately if there is no fix this isnt the biggest problem as we shouldnt be changing these variables often, but if possible it would be nice to keep it DRY so I know this will always work and doesnt need to be changed twice.p  pIf anyone has any thoughts on how this could be done better Id love to hear them.p

Unfortunately, there seems to be a bunch of different potential pointer objects in the Phaser.Input class, and Im not sure which one I need to use for codegame.input.onDowncode, which a hrefhttpphaser.iodocs2.3.0Phaser.Input.htmlonDown relnofollowsays that it gets dispatched each time a pointer is pressed downa.

Negative 10401 pI am new to this field regarding web socket. I am trying to create a simple real time application built on PHP. I found that Ratchet is one of the best choice for PHP as it eases for native PHP socket programming. I followed the Hello world tutorial found in Ratchet official site a hrefhttpsocketo.medocshelloworld relnofollowhello worlda. This tutorial is basic and it just shows how to make the entire tutorial through webbrowser console. p  pAs per the tutorial it has provided a simple shell script that we need to execute so that Ratchet web socket runs as a service alongside Apache server. Below is the Shell scriptp  precodeuse RatchetServerIoServer use RatchetHttpHttpServer use RatchetWebSocketWsServer use MyAppChat      require dirnameDIR . vendorautoload.php      server  IoServerfactory         new HttpServer             new WsServer                 new Chat                      ,         8080           servergtrun codepre  pIn the above code, it says that web socket is accessible via codeport 8080code. I went to browser and browser for codelocalhost8080code server is running without any error and browsing localhost8080 in the browser is displayed without any error. I guess everything is going well.p  pThe next thing is to establish a connection from the client side which can be done by supplying javascript code in the browser console. Below is the javascript codep  precodevar conn  new WebSocketwslocalhost8080 conn.onopen  functione      console.logConnection established   conn.onmessage  functione      console.loge.data  codepre  pWhen I run the above code, connection is established without any error. Now the problem is I do not know where to put the above JavaScript code so that I do not have to write in console everytime. I guess it should be saved in some javascript files. The above code works in port codelocalhost8080code. But how can I mention explicitly that the link codelocalhost8080chat.phpcode where chat.php would be the desired page that will be shown in the browser and maybe I can put the above JavaScript code in the same file. p  pI do not know If my question is valid or not, I am just too beginner in this field. I have also asked another question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions31366855howtobindzeromqsocketwithratchetwebsocketlibrarytomakerealtimeappl3136699031366990Binding ZMQ Socket and Ratcheta regarding the same subject but have not been satisfied yet .p

Negative 10401 pI am having trouble with Chromiumbased browsers and CORS requests that include 302 redirects.  More specifically, I am having trouble with Chromium versions 3442 inclusive 43 and later works, and it seems 33 and earlier versions worked as well I didnt test too far past 33, 28 worked.p  pMy XHR request uses withCredentialstrue, so AccessControlAllowOrigin is not allowed the server must reply with an AccessControlAllowOrigin header that echoes the incoming requests Origin header.p  pAfter receiving the first 302, Chromium 43 and later sends Origin null as part of the redirected request, and accepts AccessControlAllowOrigin null in response as does Firefox.  p  pThe Chromium series of 3442 all send the host name as Origin for all requests, and several issues from this time indicate that CORS redirects were emonlyem supported with AccessControlAllowOrigin set to , and that the original XHR must not have allowcredentials set to true, examplep  ul lia hrefhttpscode.google.compchromiumissuesdetailid154967 relnofollowhttpscode.google.compchromiumissuesdetailid154967ali ul  pI am hoping this is a misconception, and there is something as an app developer I can do on the client andor server to coerce those versions to not cancel the redirect, or failing that, ideas for a workaround.p  pVersion 33 amp earlier sent the entire host name for every request, and the full roundtrip works.p  pOne possibility for a workaround I have been experimenting with stems from the fact that, I actually do emnotem need withCredentialstrue for the crossdomain request, I only need it for the redirect back to the origin host to exchange cookiebased authentication for an accesstoken, but I could not find a way to get the client to send a cookie when following the 302 to itself unless it was also sent with the original crossdomain request.p  pTo illustrate, here are excerpts from a

Negative 10401 pIs it possible, that the width of a browsers viewport, measured in px, is not a whole numberp  pThere are devices i.e. with apples retina display, where a logical pixel is divided into two physical pixels in each direction, which makes an area of 2x24 physical pixels that are responsible for one logical pixel.p  pSuppose you have a website about Captain Kirk, and you have a header like thisp  precodelth1 classsmallgtKirklth1gt lth1 classmediumgtCaptain James T.

If the viewport has a width of 900 logical pixels or more, the element with class large is displayed instead.p  pBut on a device where each logical pixels is divided into 2 physical pixels, the boundaries defined in the stylesheet correspond with 1798 respectively 1800 physical pixels.p  pAnd here comes my questionp  pstrongIs it possiblestrong on such devices, strongthat the browsers viewport has a with of 1799 physical pixels, which means 899.5 csspixelsstrongp  pIf this is possible, then we have a viewport that is 899.5 logical pixels wide. This is greater than 899 and smaller than 900, and this means for the example from above, that in this size neither the medium, nor the large element will be displayed.p  pAnd here is another formulation of the same question p  pIn cssstylesheets strongIs it save to have mediaqueries where the sizes of elements are coded like in my examplestrongp  pIf it is not safe because there exists viewports with widths of 899.5 pixels What is a safe method to write mediaqueries that really do what the above css is meant to do p
