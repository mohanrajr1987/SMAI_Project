Positive 64818 pIve got a question about libGDX collision detection. Because its a rather specific question I have not found any good solution on the internet yet.p  pSo, I already created humans that consist of different body parts, each with rectangleshaped collision detection.p  pNow I want to implement weapons and skills, which for example look like thisp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comkGDXy.png relnofollowSkill example imageap  pstrongProblemstrongp  pWorking with rectangles in collision detections would be really frustrating for players when there are skills like this They would dodge a skill successfully but the collision detector would still damage them.p  pstrongApproach 1strongp  pBefore I started working with Libgdx I have created an Android game with a custom engine and similar skills. There I solved the problem following wayp  ol liDetect rectangle collisionli liCalculate overlapping rectangle sectionli liCheck every single pixel of the overlapping part of the skill for transparencyli liIf there is any nontransparent pixel found  Collisionli ol  pThats a kind of heavy way, but as only overlapping pixels are checked and the rest of the game is really light, it works completely fine.p  pAt the moment my skill images are loaded as TextureRegion, where it is not possible to access single pixels. I have found out that libGDX has a Pixmap class, which would allow such pixel checks. Problem is having them loaded as Pixmaps additionally would 1. be even more heavy and 2. defeat the whole purpose of the Texture system.p  pAn alternative could be to load all skills as Pixmap only. What do you think Would this be a good way Is it possible to draw many Pixmaps on the screen without any issues and lag p  pstrongApproach 2strongp  pAn other way would be to create Polygons with the shape of the skills and use them for the collision detection. p  pstrongastrong But how would I define a Polygon shape for every single skill there are over 150 of them Well after browsing a while, I found this useful tool a hrefhttpwww.aurelienribon.comblogprojectsphysicsbodyeditor relnofollowhttpwww.aurelienribon.comblogprojectsphysicsbodyeditora it allows to create Polygon shapes by hand and then save them as JSON files, readable by the libGDX application. Now here come the difficultiesp  ul liThe Physics Body Editor is connected to Box2d which I am not using. I would either have to add the whole Box2d physics engine which I do not need at all just because of one tiny collision detection OR I would have to write a custom BodyEditorLoader which would be a tough, complicated and timeintensive taskli liSome images of the same skill sprite have a big difference in their shapes like the second skill sprite example. When working with the BodyEditor tool, I would have to not only define the shape of every single skill, but I would have to define the shape of several images up to 12 of every single skill. That would be extremely timeintensive and a huge mess when implementing these dozens of polygon shapesli ul  pstrongbstrong If there is any smooth way to automatically generate Polygons out of images, that could be the solution. I could simply connect every sprite section to a generated polygon and check for collisions that way. There are a few problems thoughp  ul liIs there any smooth tool which can generate Polygon shapes out of an image and does not need too much time thereforli liI dont think that a tool like this if one exists can directly work with Textures. It would probably need Pixmaps. It would not be needed to keep te Pixmaps loaded after the Polygon creation though. Still an extremely heavy taskli ul  pstrongMy current thoughtsstrongp  pIm stuck at this point because there are several possible approaches but all of them have their difficulties. Before I choose one path and continue coding, it would be great if you could leave some of your ideas and knowledge.p  pThere might be helpful classes and code included in libGDX that solve my problems within seconds  as I am really new at libGDX I just dont know a lot about it yet.p  pCurrently I think I would go with approach 1 Work with pixel detection. That way I made exact collision detections possible in my previous Android game. p  pWhat do you thinkp  pGreetings Felixp

Positive 64818 pThis is not really a problem, more like an inconvenience. I have an abstract class called codeAppItemcode, and 6 smaller classes that extend codeAppItemcode. I also have a class called codeAppItemManagercode to manage the objects from codeAppItemcode. Each object from a daughter class contains 2 or 3 codeStringscode, 2 or 3 codeIntegerscode and a codeDoublecode. All these objects are contained in an codeArrayListltAppItemgtcode.p  pWhat I am trying to do is save the objects from this codeArrayListcode to a codeJsoncode file in LibGDXs codePreferencescode. I use the following code for thatp  precodeprivate void save      Json json  new Json     int j  0     Preferences prefs  Gdx.app.getPreferencesitemSave.json     prefs.clear      for AppItem i  AppItemManager.getAppItems          String item  json.toJsoni         prefs.putStringitem   j, item         j          prefs.putIntegernbItems, j     prefs.flush  codepre  pThe codenbItemscode contains the number of items stored in the codeJsoncode file. This works without any problems, and when I use the codePrettyPrint...code method to check it prints the objects correctly with all of their variables.p  pNow, the problem arises when I try to load this codeJsoncode when starting the applicationp  precodeprivate void load      Json json  new Json     Preferences prefs  Gdx.app.getPreferencesitemSave.json     int nbItems  prefs.getIntegernbItems     for int i  0 i lt nbItems i          String item  prefs.getStringitem   i         AppItem appItem  json.fromJsonAppItem.class, item         AppItemManager.addNewItemappItem       codepre  pThis should, in principle, load all the objects from the codeJsoncode file again and add them to the codeArrayListcode in codeAppItemManagercode. However, I get a codeSerializationExceptioncode in this linep  precode AppItem appItem  json.fromJsonAppItem.class, item codepre  pstating that the codeAppItemcode class could not be instantiated. After reading up on this subject, it seems that the problem arises when using inheritance and writing to a codeJsoncode file. When the objects are getting deserialized, LibGDX can not determine to which of the underlying classes the object belongs, thus throwing a codeSerializationExceptioncode.p  pI worked around this problem by saving an codeArrayListcode of items of each subclass into a codeJsoncode file, thus having 6 files in Preferences. Then saving and loading works smoothly. This is a lot of code and I am wondering if this can be done in a single file. Also, it would be easier as I am planning to extend the codeAppItemcode class with additional classes later on.p  pSomehow the class of each object should be added to the codeJsoncode so the deserializer knows where it belongs. I have been experimenting to let my subclasses implement codeJson.Serializablecode and add the unimplemented methods codereadJson json, JsonValue jsonDatacode and codewriteJson jsoncode. However, I have no idea what to put in these methods and the LibGDX API is surprisingly uninformative. I have also tried a hrefhttpwww.copperarrow.comblogjavajsonserializinganddeserializingpolymorphicobjects relnofollowthisa but without any success.p  pThanksp

Positive 64818 pIve a question about the libgdx Skin behavior. the game Im developing has a global AssetsManager from the libgdx suite that every class can access. I load different TextureAtlas inside this assets manage I know that assetManager.dispose disposes all the resources loaded inside the assets manager.p  pNow, I would like also to have a Skin for the GUI loaded inside the assets manager. The skin is gonna use several TextureAtlas...p  pHeres the question since Im gonna use skin.addRegion and since the online API reference about the skin class says The atlas will not be automatically disposed when the skin is disposed is it a good idea to load all the TextureAtlasof the skin in the global assets managerp  pIm fearing about the dispose action. Because when I call the assetManager.dispose both the TextureAtlas and the Skin will be called on the dispose method...but what if the TextureAtlas are disposed before the skin Could actually happen any problem about itp  pThe skin behavior is not so welldefined, I mean...what does the dispose method dop  pThank in advance,p  pLucap

Positive 64818 pIn my game I have currently two screens. The codeMenuScreencode and the codeGameScreencode. Through the Play option in the menu the player can switch to the GameScreen and start the Gameplay and with Escape he can get back to the MenuScreen. I dispose the used Assets when I switch to the other Screen in the codehidecode method and load the needed Assets for the new Screen in the constructor of the Screen I switch to. The problem is that the Textures and Sound Effects arent renderedplayed when I switch back.  For example when I start the game in the codeMenuScreencode, then switch to the codeGameScreencode everything is fine. But when I switch back to the codeMenuScreencode the codeMenuScreencode is just a black window. When I then switch to the codeGameScreencode again its black too except for the BitmapFont. Maybe there is a fundemental flaw in the way I handle this.

Positive 64818 pI am using a LibGDX framework which is basically just LWJGLJava with OpenGL for rendering  Hi, Im trying to render a laser beam, so far Ive got this effect, a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comdhyO9.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdhyO9.jpg altlaser beamap  pIts just a rectangle and then the whole effect is done in fragment Shader.p  pHowever, as it is a laser beam, I want the rectangle to face a camera, so the player always sees this red transparent line everytime. And this is driving me crazy. I tried to do some billboarding stuff, however what I want isnt really billboarding. I just want to rotate it on Z axis so that the player always sees the whole line, thats all. No X and Y rotations. p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comu7XaZ.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comu7XaZ.png altenter image description hereap  pAs you can see, thats what I want.

Positive 64818 pSo I have this game Im making with LibGDX. I have a GroundTop and Ground class that draws the ground and ground top on the screen image loading in an Assets class, and will eventually apply collisions with the player this is a platformer. What Im trying to make it do is draw 4 different Ground instances, and 2 different GroundTop instances, for testing. But, there is only one of each. What it seems like is that each instance overwrites the other, since the only ones showing up have the coordinates of the last instances created in the code. Why is this, and how can I make it so each instance is displayed Is there something that makes each instance overwrite the other in the classes I am completely lost on this.

Positive 64818 pSo Im attempting to make a oneway wall, that means my actor can pass throw this object only one side for example only by the bottom side or the upper one. I began reading this tutorial a hrefhttpwww.iforce2d.netb2dtutonewaywalls relnofollowonewaywallsa   but when I try, after checking the direction of my actor, to disable the collision it doesnt work. I think my issue could by on this part p  blockquote   pSince we will be using BeginContact event which only occurs one time per collision, we can only use SetEnabled once to alter the behavior of the contact. The problem is the contact will revert to being enabled again after each step. We could make a note of which contacts we have disabled and then check the list of them every time in PreSolve, but that is kinda inefficient and more work than I can be bothered with today. Or any day actually    So well just quietly sneak into b2Contact.cpp and comment out the line at the beginning of the Update function which reenables the contact. After youre done it should look like this  Reenable this contact.     mflags  eenabledFlagp blockquote  pThe problem is that Im using a java version of libgdx in AndroidStudio and I have no idea to how find and change this piece of code.

Positive 64818 pI am trying my best to render a texture to the screen. Ive also tried to render a sprite but none has succeeded. From my understanding the camera needs a viewport and its best to use world units when rendering your world. I get the idea about units and it makes sense. But if you say your world is 100X100 then your sprite background must also be 100X100. I still dont get it how is supposed to cover the entire device screenandroid phone. I guess providing assets at different resolutions or implementing a stretchviewport might be ideal. Also, I am trying to implement the private moveCamera method. My goal is  to have the camera move in random ways displaying parts of my texture. When i ran the code for the first time, I saw that the camera moved but then the screen turned red and then black.

Originally, I had 1 class that contained the dungeon algorithm and the rendering method. strongIt worked perfectly.strong However, I want to make themed dungeons so I moved the render method and textures to a subclass called Dungeon1. Now, all I get is a black screen when I run the code. The 2 int[][] arrays do store the map datatested through debug mode, but for some reason the tiles just wont render. I have displayed the super Dungeon and subclass Dungeon1 below.  p  precodepublic class Dungeon   public static final int tileSIZE  64  public Random rand  new Random  public int mapSize  128 public

For some reason I had it in my head that the instance of any given controller invoked by a user would persist throughout their session, and that some of the  Rails magic was in tracking objects associated with each user session.

Negative 64818 pWe run full reindexes every 7 days i.e. creating the index from scratch on our Lucene index and incremental indexes every 2 hours or so. Our index has around 700,000 documents and a full index takes around 17 hours which isnt a problem.p  pWhen we do incremental indexes, we only index content that has changed in the past two hours, so it takes much less time  around half an hour. However, weve noticed that a lot of this time maybe 10 minutes is spent running the IndexWriter.optimize method.p  pThe a hrefhttpwiki.apache.orglucenejavaLuceneFAQheadfd848c31f4dc7b91727be6f40a7f5fbe2c66cfb8LuceneFAQa mentions thatp  blockquote   pThe IndexWriter class supports an optimize method that compacts the index database and speeds up queries. You may want to use this method after performing a complete indexing of your document set or after incremental updates of the index. If your incremental update adds documents frequently, you want to perform the optimization only once in a while to avoid the extra overhead of the optimization.p blockquote  p...but this doesnt seem to give any definition for what frequently means. Optimizing is CPU intensive and VERY IOintensive, so wed rather not be doing it if we can get away with it. How much is the hit of running queries on an unoptimized index Im thinking especially in terms of query performance after a full reindex compared to after 20 incremental indexes where, say, 50,000 documents have changed Should we be optimising after every incremental index or is the performance hit not worth itp

Negative 64818 pIm going to be doing some PHP editing for my job this summer, and am looking for an effective Emacs setup for editing it.

I just started using a hrefhttpwww.emacswiki.orgemacsAutoCompleteAutoCompletea and a hrefhttpwww.emacswiki.orgemacsAnythingAnythinga for programming and general Emacs stuff, respectively.p  pWhat Im really looking for is an effective way to get Emacs to really understand the project, beyond just highlighting. a hrefhttpwww.emacswiki.orgemacsEmacsTagsEtagsa looks like a good option, but it looks like the process for generating new tags is kind of arduous and manual or at least not invisible. The nice thing about Etags is that they integrate well with Anything and AutoComplete. Other potential options are a hrefhttpwww.emacswiki.orgemacsGnuGlobalgtagsa though Im hesitant to install nonelisp files, just for the complexity, a hrefhttpwww.emacswiki.orgcgibinwikiVTagsvtagsa, or a hrefhttpwww.emacswiki.orgemacsSemanticBovinatorSemantica, which Ive messed with before and seems complicated to set up, plus it doesnt look like it has support for PHP.p  pAnother option is a hrefhttpwww.emacswiki.orgemacsImenuModeImenua, but it only works for the current buffer, and I would like to be able to jump to function definitions in other files preferably using Anything for completion of the name.p  pThe projects I will be working on are not that big about 30,000 lines total, so the overhead of Etags probably wont be that big of an issue, but Id rather not use it if there is a better solution.p  pSo what is your preferred PHP editing systemp
Negative 64818 pWe are currently trying to improve our usability in our intranet web app.  One of our goals is to declutter certain pages which have large Grids on them.

Negative 64818 pI have a problem in sql where I need to generate a packing list from a list of transactions.p  h2Data Modelh2  pThe transactions are stored in a table that containsp  ul litransaction idli liitem idli liitem quantityli ul  pEach transaction can have multiple items and coincidentally multiple rows with the same transaction id.  Each item then has a quantity from 1 to N.p  h2Business Problemh2  pThe business requires that we create a packing list, where each line item in the packing list contains the count of each item in the box.  p  pEach box can only contain 160 items they all happen to be the same sizeweight.  Based on the total count of the order we need to split items into different boxes sometimes splitting even the individual items collection into two boxesp  pSo the challenge is to take that data schema and come up with the result set that includes how many of each item belong in each box.p  pI am currently brute forcing this in some not so pretty ways and wondering if anyone has an elegantsimple solution that Ive overlooked.p  h2Example InOuth2  pWe really need to isolate how many of each item end up in each box...for example br  br  Order 1p  ul li100 of item Alili100 of item Blili140 of item Cliulbr  This should result in three rows in the result set  ul liBox 1 A 100, B 60 liliBox 2 B40, C 120 liliBox 3 C20li ul  pbr  Ideally the query would be smart enough to put all of C together, but at this point  were not too concerned with that.p

Negative 64818 pIm experimenting with using the command pattern to allow my web layer to work with Hibernate entities within the context of a single transaction thus avoiding lazy loading exceptions. I am, however, confused now with how I should deal with transactions.p  pMy commands call service layer methods that are annotated with codeTransactionalcode annotations. Some of these service layer methods are readonly  e.g. codeTransactionalreadOnlytruecode  and some are readwrite.p  pMy service layer exposes a command handler that executes commands passed to it on behalf of the web layer.p  precodeTransactional public Command handle Command cmd  throws CommandException codepre  pI assume I am right in making the command handlers codehandlecode method transactional. This is where the confusion comes in. If the implementation of a command makes calls to multiple service layer methods, there is no way for the command handler to know whether operations called within the command will be readonly, readwrite or a combination of the two.p  pI dont understand how propagation works in this example. If I were to make the codehandlecode method codereadOnlytruecode, then what happens if the command then calls a service layer method that is annotated with codeTransactionalrealOnlyfalsecodep  pId appreciate a better understanding of this and welcome your comments...p  pAndrewp

Negative 64818 pIm using AVAudioPlayer to play music in my iPhone app. p  pIn a class that I wrote I have an array that contains random ascending integers. 2, 4, 9, 17, 18, 20,... These integers represent times in the song at which a certain event should occur. So if you take the above array, after 2 seconds of the song playing, some method should be called. After 4 seconds, another method should be called. And so on.p  pI have tried using a repeating NSTimer  p  precodeNSTimer myTimer  [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval1 targetself selectorselectortimerTick userInfonil repeatsYES] codepre  pEverytime it fires, it checks whether the value of the Audioplayer and of the current arrayindex are the samep  precode void timerTick     if[[myArray objectAtIndexcurrentIndex] intValue]  intplayer.currentTime     here the eventmethod is called    currentIndex      codepre  pThis code actually works, but only for some time. After some time however, myTimer and the timer that controls the musicplayer are out of sync. So it misses an element of myArray and an infinite loop starts. I dont know exactly why they get out of sync, but I think it could be because the timer and the player arent being started at exactly the same time or maybe because of short performance lags.p  pI think I have to approach this in a totally different way. Is keyvalue observing a way to do this I could add my class as an observer to the player object, so that it gets notified when the player.currentTime value changes. But that would cause a LOT of notifications to be send and I think it would be really bad for performance.p  pAny help much appreciatedp

I dont need to know too much of the intricacies of how directx handles it, but I want to know, how is the data for the axes formattedp  pNearest I can tell, most joysticks nowadays have 12 bits of resolution, so is the data output as a 12bit 2s compliment number And after that, is it represented as a signed 16bit integer when it is captured from directxp  pId like to know this so I know how I will work with the data at the embedded platform side, such as how to format the packets sending data to the embedded side, as well ashow to use the information once it is on the embedded side.p

Negative 64818 pI have a database with PermitHolders PermitNum  PK and DetailedFacilities of each Permit Holder.  In the tblPermitDetails table there are 2 columnsp  ol liPermitNum foreign Keyli liFacilityID integer Foreign Key Lookup to Facility table.  li ol  pA permitee can have 1  29 items on their permit, e.i.  Permit 50 can have a Boat Dock FacID 4, a Paved walkway FacID 17 a Retaining Wall FacID 20 etc.  I need an SQL filterdisplay whatever, ALL PERMIT s that have ONLY FacIDs 19, 20, or 28, NOT ones that have those plus x others,....just that subset.  Ive worked on this for 4 days, would someone PLEASE help me  I HAVE posted to other BB but have not received any helpful suggestions.p  pAs Oded suggested, here are more details.  There is no PK for the tblPermitDetails table.p  pLets say that we have Permitees 1  10 Permit 1 is John Doe, he has a Boat Dock FacID 1, a Walkway FacID 4, a buoy FacID 7, and Underbrushing FacID 19...those are 3 records for Permit 1.  Permit 2 is Sus Brown, she has ONLY underbrushing FacID 19, Permit 3 is Steve Toni, he has a Boat Dock FacID 1, a Walkway FacID 4, a buoy FacID 7, and a Retaining Wall FacID 20.  Permit 4 is Jill Jack, she has Underbrushing FacID 19, and a Retaining Wall FacID 20.  I could go on but i hope you follow me.  I want an SQL for MS Access that will show me ONLY Permits 2 amp 4 because they have a combination of FacIDs 19 amp 20 [either both, or one or the other], BUT NOT ANYTHING ELSE such as Permit 1 who has 19, but also has 4 amp 7.p  pI hope that helps, please say so if not.p  pOh yea, I DO know the difference between i.e. and e.g. since im in my 40s have written over 3000 pages of archaeological field reports and an MA thesis, but Im really stressed out here from struggling with this SQL and could care less about consulting the Chicago Manual of Style before banging out a plea for help.

If not, its a new entity Entitystate is marked as Added.

Negative 64818 pI want to change our search as it is a bit hacky now. Currently it works like thisp  ol liUser enter a text in a textbox, for example strongVolvostrong and start searching.   li liThis search with SQL all posts containing Volvo.   li liThe result is a list with 2 columns, BoldID and DisplayValue.  li liBoldID is just an unique number to identify the object in database. li liDisplayValue is what the user see in the list of results.li liEach row in the resultset is identified with a row number in users list. The first with 1, the second with 2 and so on.li liThere is also a limitation to only show max 99 hits by intention by looping the query in code. It is not good to have a query that returns many hits as it no meaning to have more in the users hit list. The search should be more specific in that case.li ol  pThe result list is displayed in a separate global window called rightpane. The hacky part is that if searching from a modal dialog then rightpane must be undocked from the main window to be able to pick a value with the mouse. We suspect this could be a reason that the application sometimes lock itself with the modal dialog behind the main window.p  pAfter change it should work like thisp  pThe user enter text in a Combobox and start searching with SQL on demand like before. But the resultset is displayed in the combobox. So I only want to change the display if possible as there are a lot of old SQL queries that is in use and works fine now.p  pWe use Delphi 2007, Interbase 2009 and components from DevExpress.

Negative 64818 pI work on Linux for ARM processor for cable modem. There is a tool that I have written that sendsstorms customized UDP packets using raw sockets. I form the packet from scratch so that we have the flexibility to play with different options. This tool is mainly for stress testing routers.p  pI actually have multiple interfaces created. Each interface will obtain IP addresses using DHCP. This is done in order to make the modem behave as virtual customer premises equipment vcpe. p  pWhen the system comes up, I start those processes that are asked to. Every process that I start will continuously send packets. So process 0 will send packets using interface 0 and so on. Each of these processes that send packets would allow configuration change in UDP parameters and other options at run time. Thats the reason I decide to have separate processes.p  pI start these processes using fork and excec from the provisioning processes of the modem. p  pThe problem now is that each process takes up a lot of memory. Starting just 3 such processes, causes the system to crash and reboot.p  pI have tried the followingp  pI have always assumed that pushing more code to the Shared Libraries will help. So when I tried moving many functions into shared library and keeping minimum code in the processes, it made no difference to my surprise.  I also removed all arrays and made them use the heap. However it made no difference. This maybe because the processes runs continuously and it makes no difference if it is stack or heap  I suspect the process from I where I call the fork is huge and that is the reason for the processes that I make result being huge. I am not sure how else I could go about. say process A is huge  I start process B by forking and excec. B inherits As memory area. So now I do this  A starts C which inturn starts B will also not help as C still inherits A. I used vfork as an alternative which did not help either. I do wonder why.p  pI would appreciate if someone give me tips to help me reduce the memory used by each independent child processes. p

I want it to be so that the only way the files are accessed through the user webpage.  Also I want each user to be able to access only their own files and not the others.  So here is my code and if there are any additional changes that need to be made to avoid hacking I will greatly appreciate the input.p  pindex.php file code for the form that is being used to input username and passwordp  precodeltform nameform1 methodpost actionchecklogin.phpgt             ltdiv classleftsgt             ltpgtLoginltpgt             ltpgtPasswordltpgt             ltdivgt              ltdivgt             ltinput namemyusername typetext idmyusername gt             ltinput namemypassword typepassword idmypassword gt             ltdivgt          ltdivgtltinput typeimage nameSubmit idsubmit valueLogin srcimagessubmitOff.png gtltdivgt ltformgt codepre  pchecklogin.php if correct username and password is entered, it goes to the username webpage.  if not it goes to the wrong username or password webpagep  precodeltphp obstart sessionstart hosthostname  Host name usernameusername  Mysql username passwordpassword  Mysql password dbnamedbnamey  Database name tblnametablename  Table name   Connect to server and select databse. mysqlconnecthost, username, passwordor diecannot connect mysqlselectdbdbnameor diecannot select DB   Define myusername and mypassword myusernamePOST[myusername] mypasswordPOST[mypassword]   To protect MySQL injection more detail about MySQL injection myusername  stripslashesmyusername mypassword  stripslashesmypassword myusername  mysqlrealescapestringmyusername mypassword  mysqlrealescapestringmypassword  sqlSELECT username FROM tblname WHERE usernamemyusername and passwordmypassword resultmysqlquerysql  returns false if no results returned row  mysqlfetchrowresult  If result matched myusername and mypassword, table row must be 1 row  ifrow  Register myusername, mypassword and redirect to file SESSION[myusername]  myusername SESSION[mypassword]  mypassword myPage  myusername..php SESSION[myPage]  myPage  headerlocation.myPage  else  headerlocationindex2.php   obendflush gt codepre  pusername1.php webapge for user that contains filesp  precodelt sessionstart if sessionisregisteredmyusername     issetSESSION[myusername]      SESSION[myPage]  basenameSERVER[REQUESTURI]  headerlocationindex.php  gt  lthtmlgt content that consist of links to the files lta hrefreadyusername1file.pnggtPng 1ltagt lthtmlgt codepre

Clients request, but read in computer terms like 259200 in seconds, and could contain many occuring of that pattern.p  pI was thinking to try to create a replacement expression that multiplies 1 and 2, or even pass 1 and 2 to a function, or pass 1  2 to an evaluation context, but I have to create a function for it and do it manually.p  pThe closest I got is p  precodevar x  [09]ss[09]g   , r  functionm            return m[1]  m[2]          while m  x.execs   s  s.replace x, rm codepre  pThat sucks a little because codeexeccode returns strongonly the first matchstrong. After handling it in the replace statement  next search starts again from the start of the string  which is a string of 60K length...p  pA good solution will be one of the following a perform the match starting from an index without creating a new substring for that b provide a replace expression that allows evaluationp  pThe alternative approach will be to tokenize the string, and process it in bits  which is a total alternative to the codeRegExpcode that will take a lot of code and effort, in which case Ill just live with the performance penalty or give a better fight on a better alternative for this requirement...p  pHelp anybodyp

Negative 64818 pI want to know if calculation of the function value and assignment of the result to a variable is an atomic operation in Java.p  pFor examplep  pI have a threadsafe priority queue codeqcode. In codeqcode I save elements, and each element has a coderankcode according to which it is placed in the queue. In addition I have a shared variable codetopRankcode that should always contain the rank of the topmost element in codeqcode. The following code is executed in parallel by number of threadsp  precodeelement  q.remove  do something with element topRank  q.peek codepre  pcould it happen that threadA would remove one elements from codeqcode and calculate value of codeq.peekcode and just before assigning it to codetopRankcode would be interrupted by threadB, then threadB would remove one more element from codeqcode and update codetopRankcode. And then threadA would resume to assignment of incorrect value to the codetopRankcode.p  pA link to official literature would be very appreciated.p  pThanks.p

Negative 64818 pIm using a mechanism to pass bootstrapping information embedded in the host page which is a servletjsp combination from the server to the client. The bootstrapping information contains vital information that is required during client start up which saves one clientserver round trip and therefore speeds up application start up.p  pIm using Gson to serialize the bootstrapping information and inject it directly into a  tag in the host page. The information is accessed on the client using a hrefhttpcode.google.comwebtoolkitdoclatestDevGuideCodingBasicsOverlay.html relnofollowJS Overlay Typesa. Because passing long values from JS to Java isnt supported by GWT Im using a custom JsonSerializer which turns all longsLongs into Strings.p  pAll of this works fine but it is a little fragile. Therefore Id love to verify the correct behavior in an integration test which covers both the server and the client side components.

Negative 64818 pI have some Ruby web apps that use OpenID for authentication and store the session in a cookie. There are a few API and AJAX related things that my Ruby frameworks arent a good fit for, so Ive got some node.js services. The problem is that if someone knew the URLs of my AJAX services, theyd basically be open to the public as things stand. At the moment those services do a simple check of the Origin header, but obviously thats very easy to forge.p  pSo I want to be able to restrict access to the services running on Node or Python, or in a nonRack based Ruby service, or anything else to users who are logged into the main service thats run through a Rackbased web application. Are there any conventions for how this sort of thing is done Ive seen heaps of websites that will serve content and pages through codeexample.comcode, and then the AJAX calls get made through codeapi.example.comcode, so Im surprised this is something I havent read about.p  pI do have an idea for how to do this, and Id love some feedback on whether Im missing something blindingly obvious that makes this insecurep  pMy Ruby web app uses OpenID for authentication and stores the session in a session cookie using codeRackSessioncode. From looking at the codeRackSessioncode source, my framework seems to go through this processp  ul ligenerate a Marshal dump of my User objectli ligenerate a SHA1 hash of the Marshal based on a secret keyli listore a hex digest of the SHA1 hash in a cookieli ul  pSo theoretically I could have a prearranged key or system for generating the key, or some message passing between frameworks through a secure channel to share the key. Then I could reverse the encryption process in any other framework that wanted to be able to verify session data. Id have to get rid of the first step and only store JSON data or something instead of a Ruby object for crosslanguage compatibility, of course.p  pIs this considered a secure way to do things, assuming the protocols for sharing the key are appropriately securep

Negative 64818 pWe currently have a big project that consists of the following layersp  ul liMS SQL Server databaseli liMicrosoft RIA WCF Service layerli liIIS and li liExtJS web applicationli ul  pEverything works more or less. The only my concern is I think second layer is a bit over kill and over complicated for what we have on the front end  the whole task for it is to generate JSON messages with the data from the database. This structure was chosen because originally we were planning to use Silverlight as a front end thank God we decide to drop it in the favor of ExtJs btw.p  pNow I have couple other web projects on the horizon and Im wondering if dropping this second layer RIA WCF is the right choice. What are my other options if I decide to stick with MSSQLIISExtJs If somebody had experience with something else I would appreciate any feedback. Any links would be very helpful too. p

My first reaction was using regex but i soon realised that it was stupid. Then i thought that i can codesplitcode on the separatorcode,code in the above case but even the separator is not fixed. Also this approach would be useless for entries like this codememory 4 GB 1333 MHz DDR3code Using whitespace as separator for this entry would make it look like code4code  codeGBcode  code1333code  codeMHzcode  are different but actually code4 GBcode and code1333 MHzcode are different.

I can hear the ad.p  pThis has been tested and reproduced on an iPhone 4, 4S, 5, and iPod Touch 4th gen. The iphone 4 is on iOS 5, the rest are iOS 6. It happens most of the time, but not every single time. But for sure, I want to emphasize that strongthis only happens if my variant playlist contains more than one bitrate child playlist.strongp  pHere is an example of a playlist that I use this is the 400kbps version, and I have a  200 and 800kbps version with corresponding playlists that look exactly like the following, but replace all 400s with 200 and 800. Well, the actual playlist is longer but this is an example.p  precodeEXTM3U EXTXTARGETDURATION10 EXTXMEDIASEQUENCE0 EXTINF10, 400clipA0.ts EXTINF10, 400clipA1.ts EXTINF5, 400clipA2.ts  EXTXDISCONTINUITY EXTINF10, 400advert0.ts EXTINF3, 400advert1.ts  EXTXDISCONTINUITY EXTINF10, 400clipB0.ts EXTINF10, 400clipB1.ts EXTINF5, 400clipB2.ts  EXTXENDLIST codepre  pAnd I have the variant playlist that selects between the child playlistsp  precodeEXTM3U EXTXSTREAMINFPROGRAMID1,BANDWIDTH240000 clips200.m3u8 EXTXSTREAMINFPROGRAMID1,BANDWIDTH440000 clips400.m3u8 EXTXSTREAMINFPROGRAMID1,BANDWIDTH840000 clips800.m3u8 codepre  pNote that what happens 75 of the time is that when I play this, the video will go to black after the very first discontinuity tag right before the ad and never recover again, although I can hear the audio of the ad. For example, if I made my variant playlist with only a single bitrate variantp  precodeEXTM3U EXTXSTREAMINFPROGRAMID1,BANDWIDTH280000 clips200.m3u8 codepre  pThen I do not get this problem at all Very strange. Additionally, if I remove all the discontinuity tags and still keep the other bitrates in the variant playlist, then it works fine usually, but occasionally it will skip an entire .ts file for some reason, probably because it needs those discontinuity tags.p  pAdditionally, this happens more often when I play the files directly on Amazon Cloudfront, compared to from the Amazon S3 bucket where they originally reside.p  pSome other info that might help My original files clips and ads are all .mov files taken from an iPhone 4, with the same resolution on each. My outputs the .ts files were all then generated from these  for each bitrate class, I have the same encoding settings across the clips and ads. Outputs are all the same resolution and framerate otherwise.p  pOne last thing, the mediasegmentvalidator provided by Apple does not give any warnings when I use it to check.p  pI really appreciate any help that you guys can offer This is a puzzling problem for me p
Negative 64818 pI was wondering how bad would be the impact in the performance of a program migrated to shell script from C. p  pI have intensive IO operations.p  pFor example, in C, I have a loop reading from a filesystem file and writing into another one.

Negative 64818 pIm trying to allow users to edit a list UL.

Ive noticed that on most of them they use custom events to trigger methods instead of calling a method directly. p  pWhats the reasoning behind this practice Why arent they just calling the methodp  pFor example p  hr  pWe have two objects codeAcode and codeBcode. codeAcode has method codeA.methodAcode that codeBcode needs to use when codeXcode condition is triggered. p  pWhy implementp  blockquote   pcodeBcode dispatches an event to codeAcode that tells codeAcode to run codeA.methodAcodep blockquote  pInstead ofp  blockquote   pcodeBcode uses codeA.methodAcodep blockquote

Negative 64818 pIm developing a Pythonapplication that talks to the user, and performs tasks based on what the user sayse.g. UserDo I have any new facebookmessages, answerYes, you have 2 new messages. Would you like to see them. Functionality like integration with facebook or twitter is provided by plugins. Based on predefined parsing rules, my application calls the plugin with the parsed arguments, and uses its response. The application needs to be able to answer multiple querys from different users at the same timeor practically the same time.p  pCurrently, I need to call a function, Respond, with the user input as argument. This has some disadvantages, howeverp  piThe application can only speak when it is spoken to. It cant decide to query facebook for new messages, and tell the user whether it does, without being told to do that.p  piiHaving a conversation with multiple users at a time is very hard, because the application can only do one thing at a time if Alice asks the application to check her Facebook for new messages, Bob cant communicate with the application.p  piiiI cant developand use plugins that take a lot of time to complete, e.g. download a movie, because the application isnt able to do anything whilesame the previous task isnt completed.p  pMultithreading seems like the obvious way to go, here, but Im worried that creating and using 500 threads at a time dramatically impacts performance, so using one thread per querya query is a statement from the user doesn seem like the right option.p  pWhat would be the right way to do this Ive read a bit about Twisted, and the reactor approach seems quite elegant. However, Im not sure how to implement something like that in my application.p

Negative 64818 pIve seen other questions about getting objects from Sets based on index value and I understand why that is not possible. But I havent been able to find a good explanation for why a get by object is not allowed so thought I would ask.p  pHashSet is backed by a HashMap so getting an object from it should be pretty straightforward. As it is now, it appears I would have to iterate over each item in the HashSet and test for equality which seems unecessary.p  pI could just use HashMap but I have no need for a keyvalue pair, I just need a Set.p  pFor Example say I have Foo.javap  precodepackage example  import java.io.Serializable  public class Foo implements Serializable       String id     String description      public FooString id         this.id  id           public void setDescriptionString description         this.description  description           public String getDescription         return this.description           public boolean equalsObject obj          equals code, checks if ids are equal           public int hashCode          hash code calculation        codepre  pand Example.javap  precodepackage example  import java.util.HashSet  public class Example       public static void mainString[] args         HashSetltFoogt set  new HashSetltFoogt          Foo foo1  new Foo1         foo1.setDescriptionNumber 1          set.addfoo1         set.addnew Foo2          I want to get the object stored in the Set, so I construct a object that is equal to the one I want.         Foo theFoo  set.getnew Foo1 Is there a reason this is not allowed         System.out.printlntheFoo.getDescription Should print Number 1        codepre  pIs it because the equals method is meant to test for absolute equality rather than logical equality in which case containsObject o would be sufficientp

Negative 64818 pI want to know what do you think about this. Is recommended to use synchronous requests XMLHttpRequest in a web worker What problems can I findp  pI have been testing this in my app and I havent find any trouble. But Im afraid of this synchronus behaviour because of old experiences with jQuery and AJAX. My app gets a big amount of data from several tables in a database, and this requires a time. For each bunch of data retrieved from a table, I need to instantly process it to not delay the whole thing too much. Meanwhile, the user is interacting with the browser, so it can be blocked, and I thought that web workers would work fine. Do you thing that this is a good solution Or should I try with asynchronus requestsp  pThank you.p

Negative 64818 pI am currently working on a bigger project with a lot of libraries included and I have some questions about why gcc under linux behaves the way it does.p  pFirst, as I think you might be aware, you can use the lxyz linker flag to gccg to search for libxyz.so in some system paths and link to it. However, this does not work in the case of static libraries, i.e. if I want to link against libxyz.a I have to add usrliblibxyz.a as an object file explicitely.p  pMy problem is the following If I want to include a pkgconfig style .pc file in my project, what should I put in it if the user chooses to build a static libraryp  pAlso, I found it rather annoying that gccg does not handle library dependencies the way I would expectp  pIf I link my program against a libabc.so and if ldd tells me that libabc.so depends on libxyz.so then I think that gccg should be smart enough to also link against libxyz.so. Sadly, this seems not to be the case. Is there any good reason why this does not work or is there a possibility to force gccg to consider these dependenciesp

Now, the tricky thing is I need to be able to provide functionality to the user to be able to edit these on the same same screen. So essentially when the user taps on a row in the table view, I want that little flashing text line at the end of the current text in the row so the user can edit whats currently present and I also want a save button to apear on the top when  a user has started editing. The tricky part is, not all fields in my table view will be editable. So, I need certain fields to be editable and have the save button appear and certain fields not.  Can you tell me how would I go about modifying my existing design to implement this functionality I would appreciate some code if you think you can show me how exactly I would go about doing things.p
Negative 64818 pIm tying to generate an Atom feed for my link blog and distribute it with FeedBurner. Ive run into a strange problem where neither the original XML file on my server, or FeedBurners feed, display links in feed readers. p  pHopefully I can link these directly since its a problem with the specific feed  the FAQ wasnt really clear. If not I will be glad to remove the links and paste in the files, but that seemed like it would add a lot of clutter to the question.p  pIm not too familiar with generating RSSAtom feeds, and running it through the validator shows that it passes. Additionally, the links display fine on Feedburners frontend page. This is why I dont understand why Google Reader et al dont display the links.p  pWithout further ado, [here is the original xml file][1] and [here is feedburners resulting page][2].p

I thought that maybe I could include a start position in my script by getting the current position of the top of the page using codedocument.scrollTopcode but it does not work p  precode.home, header ul li.clickfunctione    e.preventDefault    var id  this.attrdatarel    window.location.hash  id.replaceg,     .scrollToidanchor, 500,         easing  easeInCubic,        onAfterfunction                         .home, header ul li.removeClassselected           this.addClassselected             codepre

I am unable though to append these new items to the current masonry layout. This is why I am creating a second masonry container. On the first new set ot items, they are being generated on the top of the page and then, they move down to the bottom in a quite ugly way. After that all new Items are being added correctly, sometimes they overlap each other, sometimes not, I guess non cached images overlap. What I want to achieve is to be able to find the .box html item from codedatacode and then append it to the existing masonry container. I have been struggling to do this for some time now after reading all related questions here, but still no success.p
Negative 64818 pOkay everyone,p  pApologies in advance for the length.

Negative 64818 pI have a problem with a backup script which is supposed to call a bash startingstopping script, in which a daemon via GNU screen is managed. For the moment my python backup script is called via cron. Within the codelaunch.shcode script there is a determination of the given parameter. If stop is given the script echos Stopping... and runs the GNU screen command to shut down the session. The same goes for start.

Negative 64818 pIm working all day on this, but Im stuck and dont have a solution. It seems pretty simple..p  pI have a datagrid with a dynamic amount of columns. Each column has a DataGridTemplateColumn with a CellTemplate and a CellEditingTemplate. The CellEditingTemplate contains a Combobox with values which after the user has selected a value, the TextBox in the CellTemplate has to be updated to the selected value. Normally you would bind this to a known property in an object, but since I dont know how many columns the user needs in advance, I have to create these properties or something else at runtime and try to bind this textbox and combobox to this property. How do I solve this I prefer to not use ExpandoObjects and Im bounded to .net 4.0p  pMy solution which didnt work yet is to add a wrapperobject to a listarray in each row object and then generate a new DataGridTemplateColumn in code where the combobox and the textbox have databindings to this wrapperobject in the array. In XAML this would look something like  , but I cant get this 0 changed into 1,2,3,... I could do this in the code behind, but I dont know how to bind it to a WrapperObjectList[X].Valuep  pHere is a simplified example, hopefully helping understanding what Id like to achievep  pI have datagrid which is binded to an observablecollection with RowObjects [rowobject represents 1 row..   ]. The first column is fixed, so its binded to a property in a RowObject.p  pNow I have to add a dynamic amount of columns after this. This is based on how many items the user has selected not in the example, but youll get the point. I replaced this action with clicking the button.p  pFor each column I create a wrapperobject and add this to another observablecollection within the RowObject. This gives me a bit of flexibility since I dont know in advance how many columns will be added. This Wrapperobject contains the value I need to display. p  pFurthermore, I need this WrapperObject to be binded to a selection in my combobox. So if I edit a row, I select a value from the combobox and then this selected value has to be displayed set in the TextBox of the celltemplate.p  pExample codep  pCode behindp  precodepublic partial class MainWindow  Window      public MainWindow              InitializeComponent         LoadData           this.DataContext  RowList            private void LoadData              RowList  new ObservableCollectionltRowObjectgt         WrapperObject lWrapperObject1  new WrapperObject         lWrapperObject1.Value  1         WrapperObject lWrapperObject2  new WrapperObject         lWrapperObject2.Value  2          WrapperObject lWrapperObject3  new WrapperObject         lWrapperObject3.Value  3         WrapperObject lWrapperObject4  new WrapperObject         lWrapperObject4.Value  4          WrapperObject lWrapperObject6  new WrapperObject         lWrapperObject6.Value  6         WrapperObject lWrapperObject8  new WrapperObject         lWrapperObject6.Value  8          RowObject lRowObject1  new RowObject         lRowObject1.RowObjectName  RowObject1         lRowObject1.WrapperCollection.AddlWrapperObject1         lRowObject1.WrapperCollection.AddlWrapperObject2         lRowObject1.WrapperCollection.AddlWrapperObject6          RowObject lRowObject2  new RowObject         lRowObject2.RowObjectName  RowObject2         lRowObject2.WrapperCollection.AddlWrapperObject3         lRowObject2.WrapperCollection.AddlWrapperObject4         lRowObject2.WrapperCollection.AddlWrapperObject8          RowList.AddlRowObject1         RowList.AddlRowObject2             public ObservableCollectionltRowObjectgt RowList  get set        private void ButtonClickobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e              DataGridTemplateColumn lTemplateColumn  new DataGridTemplateColumn         lTemplateColumn.Header  NewDynamicColumn         var lMyCellTemplate DataTemplateResources[myCellTemplate]         var lMyCellEditingTemplate  DataTemplateResources[myCellEditingTemplate]           TextBinding WrapperCollection[1].Value           lTemplateColumn.CellTemplate lMyCellTemplate         lTemplateColumn.CellEditingTemplate  lMyCellEditingTemplate         this.MyGrid.Columns.AddlTemplateColumn        public class RowObject  INotifyPropertyChanged       public RowObject              WrapperCollection  new ObservableCollectionltWrapperObjectgt         ComboBoxList  new Listltstringgt         ComboBoxList.Add10         ComboBoxList.Add20            public ObservableCollectionltWrapperObjectgt WrapperCollection  get set       private string fRowObjectName      public string RowObjectName              get  return fRowObjectName          set                      fRowObjectName  value             RaisePropertyChangedRowObjectName                    public Listltstringgt ComboBoxList  get set       region Notify property changed     public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged     public void RaisePropertyChangedstring propertyName              if PropertyChanged  null                      PropertyChangedthis, new PropertyChangedEventArgspropertyName                   endregion    public class WrapperObject  INotifyPropertyChanged      private int fValue      public int Value                get return fValue         set                      fValue  value             RaisePropertyChangedValue                    region Notify property changed     public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged     public void RaisePropertyChangedstring propertyName              if PropertyChanged  null                      PropertyChangedthis, new PropertyChangedEventArgspropertyName                   endregion  codepre  pXamlp  precodeltWindow.Resourcesgt     ltDataTemplate xKeymyCellTemplategt         ltTextBlock TextBinding WrapperCollection[1].Value gt     ltDataTemplategt      ltDataTemplate xKeymyCellEditingTemplategt         ltComboBox ItemsSourceBinding ComboBoxList gt     ltDataTemplategt ltWindow.Resourcesgt  ltStackPanelgt     ltDataGrid   xNameMyGrid                  AutoGenerateColumnsFalse                 ItemsSourceBinding                 gt         ltDataGrid.Columnsgt             ltDataGridTextColumn HeaderName BindingBinding RowObjectNamegt             ltDataGridTextColumn HeaderExampleColumn1 BindingBinding WrapperCollection[0].Valuegt             ltDataGridTemplateColumn HeaderExampleColumn2 CellTemplateStaticResource myCellTemplate CellEditingTemplateStaticResource myCellEditingTemplategt                    ltDataGrid.Columnsgt     ltDataGridgt     ltButton ContentClick ClickButtonClick Width100 Margin20gt ltStackPanelgt codepre  pExampleColumn1 and ExampleColumn2 are the only editable columns in this example and once you click the button, the added columns are also editable.

Negative 64818 pI have used zbar scanner for android and it captures the barcodes quite easily.  But the problem is that on phones which have autofocus, it captures the barcodes too quickly to detect it correctly.  If only it could wait for a few milliseconds more, it could then be able to capture more clearer image and thereby not show not found page. p  pHow can I solve this problem  Is there a provision to delay the focus on the barcode  Maybe a delay in capturing the imagep
Negative 64818 pIm trying to use pgsearch to search through an associated model.  When I run a search I get the error PGError ERROR  column plans.name does not exist.  Im running the search in the plans model and trying to search against association the place with a column name.  The hasmany through model that connects these is polymorphic.  Somehow the sql query is combining the two and throwing an error.  Ive run the associatedagainst migration rails g pgsearchmigrationassociatedagainst, scoured the documentation, and looked for others with the error and come up with nothing, it must be that Im just overlooking something.  It runs correctly without the more extensive search results if I just remove the associatedagainst line in plan.rb.

Negative 64818 pI configure the windows 2008 as Exchange2010 server, which has domain Example.com, and the other  Windows 7 client as Exchange2010 client. The Server IP address is 192.168.0.76 , meanwhile the client IP address is 192.168.0.176.p  pWe all know that, when the the client request to the Exchange2010 server, we can configure it through kerberos authentication. The client can get the Ticket from the KDC of Windows 2008. For further detail, the Client can get the encrypted Servicekey through the TGSREP message of kerberos from the KDC of Windows 2008.p  pUnder these circumstances, I have an idea is that we configure Red Hat Linux as Domain Controller in my organisation to get the encrypted Servicekey. The Red Hat Linux ip address is 192.168.0.149. The Red Hat Linux used as Domain Controller, which has the function of KDC instead of the function of Windows 2008 servers KDC.p  pMy first question is that is that is my idea feasible Or if it not feasible, how can I get the servicekey p  pMy Second question is that the Red Hat Linux has samba installed, and the samba can used as domain controller, how can samba get the synchronize users informations as well as password and Ticket informations from Windows Server2 008p

Negative 64818 pIs there any existing nonproprietary solution how to mirror current day data onto separate disk with minimum delay under second, so that I can use smaller, non redundant but more expensive disk for high rate of reads specifically for SQL Server 2012p  pMore backgroundp  ul liWe have a transnational DB that needs to be redundant, there are few dozen thousands of new rows daily handled without any problem but main perf impact on DB is from reads that happen few times per second. Reads need to have fresh data at max 1 second old, but they are only interested in current day data. All writes need to go to disk array with also very small delay.li liI can use small fast but nonredundant SSD disk to optimize reads.li ul  pThere are few proprietary options  e.g. send each update to two separate nonrelated DBs  one slower and redundant and other faster for reading.p  pHowever is there any existing solution for this  how to mirror all inserts to secondary DB and purge each midnightp

The functions exported include from the .h filep  precodeEX CS BL BOOL CD CsilInitvoid EX CS BL BOOL CD CsilUnInitvoid EX CS BL BOOL CD CsilConnectTCHAR  server, TCHAR  service EX CS BL BOOL CD CsilReadvoid EX CS BL BOOL CD CsilGetDataTCHAR buffer[], int bufflen codepre  pthe first 4 of which I have mapped as followsp  precodeboolean CsilInit boolean CsilUnInit boolean CsilConnectWString server, WString service boolean CsilRead codepre  pAll of these seem to be working OK. My problem comes when I try to map the arguments for CsilGetData  the code is presumably expecting a pointer to an array of Unicode characters whose size is defined in the second argument, but I have so far been unable to come up with the correct Java mapping. When called, the buffer will be loaded with data by the native code, and the data will then be read by the calling Java code when the function returns.p  pCan anyone provide an example of the correct way to do thisp  pAs suggested, I have tried as a test mapping CsilGetData asp  precodeboolean CsilGetDataWString buffer, int bufflen codepre  pand then calling it as followsp  precodeWString buffer  new WString                ... while CSIL.INSTANCE.CsilGetDatabuffer, buffer.length    System.out.printbuffer.toString  codepre  pbut executing the call to CsilGetData givesp  blockquote   pException in thread main java.lang.Error Invalid memory access           at com.sun.jna.Native.invokeIntNative Method           at com.sun.jna.Function.invokeFunction.java371           at com.sun.jna.Function.invokeFunction.java315           at com.sun.jna.LibraryHandler.invokeLibrary.java212           at com.sun.proxy.Proxy0.CsilGetDataUnknown Source           at qeitest.Main.mainMain.java66p blockquote  pTechnomage suggested using char[] instead, so I revised the code to define the mapping asp  precodeboolean CsilGetDatachar[] buffer, int bufflen codepre  pand then invoked it asp  precodepublic static final int cnstBufLen  2048 char[] buffer  new char[cnstBufLen] ... while CSIL.INSTANCE.CsilGetDatabuffer, cnstBufLen    System.out.printbuffer.toString  codepre  pbut I still get the same Memory Access exception.

Negative 64818 pIm having some difficulty digesting the some concepts in the Java IO classes. For instance there are two types of streams, byte and char. Byte streams as I understand read byte by byte. br br 1. If a char in java is stored as a 16bit two byte data type, how is it possible for me to accurately read a char, say A, from a file using a byte oriented input stream eg. FileInputStream br br 2. Is it that the chars I used mostly between 0 and 122 on the ascii chart are stored in one byte of the two bytes allocatedbr br 3. DataInputStreamDataOutputStream allows me to read and write binary data, other input streams like FileInputStreamFileOutputStream allows me to read and write what exactly I basically want to know which stream to use when I wish to output data as text I can read using a simple text editor like notepad versus when I want it encoded as raw binary data text that looks like garbage in notepad p  pStruggling to understand the concept of streams in java and which to use when. p

Negative 64818 pMy ASP.NET MVC application will be deployed to a series of loadbalanced web servers. One problem Im still working out is how to handle dynamicallyuploaded file content, such as useruploaded images  obviously, saving them on the server where they were uploaded wont allow them to be accessed from the other servers in the load balanced group.p  pCurrently Im planning to save these to a shared storage location, specifically a UNC path referring to a directory on our NAS but Im not sure how best to retrieve these files to display them to the client. Im thinking Ill need to write a custom route handler of some kind to retrieve them from the nonwebaccessible storage location on the server side and then stream them back to the client. This seems relatively straightforward to do, yet Im struggling with how to begin to approach this in ASP.NET.p  pAnother solution Ive considered is creating a Virtual Directory in each application directory which points to the network directory.p  pIve even considered uploading the files to Amazon S3 via the file upload handling code and using CloudFront to delivery them, but Id rather avoid the external service dependency.p  pWhich approach do you recommend, and are there established best practices or even existing componentslibraries available for accomplishing this sort of thingp

Negative 64818 pin South America, many gamers use something called a proxy service which takes their network connection, routes it through their own infrastructure and then exit close to the game server location.. E.g. they want to control that the TCP Traffic does not cross the USA for latency reasons.. So, how could they manipulate the path taken by a TCP connection p  pa Do they just open up TCP conections in low traffic times e.g. 4 in the morning and then keep those for the rest of the day p  pb Do they keep trying to open up TCP connections UNTIL they get lower latency one and then switch their internal traffic to that connection p  pc Is the only thing they can do to minify TCP latency over long distances to rent private peerings or choose a hoster with good ones p  pd Could sending UDP packets over such distances reduce latency IF and only if you skip out packet loss e.g. by sending the traffic redudantmultiple packets each p  pIt all boils down to the question whether u can control somehow what path a TCP connection takes or if you cant.p  pThis talk is all about the networking part which is NOT about the endusers computer LeantrixTCP Optimizations or the game servers..

Negative 64818 pIve setup several sites previously to use Netbeans Remote Synchronization so I can edit files on the server from my machine and it has worked perfectly. p  pThe problem Im having right now is that when my FTP configuration in Netbeans uses the root folder it lists everything correctly but when I use a sub directory for example website.comsubdir as the upload directory or as the FTP initial directory the sync results come up blank  doesnt list anything at all on the remote side except directories in that sub directory.p  pMy PC is a windows 7 64 bit machine, and the server is a standard shared hosting account running CPanel. p  pAlso, I have been able to run the subdir synchronization on a different pc, could it be the firewall on this one If so, why does it list the root folder properlyp  pHas anyone else had this issue Any suggestions on how to fix itp  pThanks.p

Negative 64818 pI wrote an update function that is called from the main loop. Since the implementation is subjected to certain timing constraints it is programmed in such way that each update function is aloud to take 50 ms max. In the case a function does not return a value within 50 ms the main loop aborts with an error message stating that a certain function took to long. p  pThe issue is that I am trying to read from a earlier setup opened socket. Sometimes reading from this socket takes 10 ms, but in other cases it takes 100 ms allowing the main loop to abort. Therefore, it seems to be the case that I wrote this function using blocking methods. I have no idea how I can solve this or even implement a solution to this. Someone gave me the hint to work with a timer. The function isp  precodeint socketupdatevoid      n  readsockfd, recvBuff, sizeofrecvBuff1     if n gt 0         Run some code          else if n lt 0         printfn Read error n        return 0        return 1  codepre  pTherefore, I am under the impression that the read function is blocking the main loop.p  pHow can I solve thisp

Negative 64818 pI recently finished up the basics of Javascript, CSS, HTML, and have started jQuery. I decided that I knew enough to make a simple hangman game, so Ive decided to do just that. I have most of it done, however I cannot seem to get the game to replace the dashes at the bottom if they guess the correct letter. Also if they guess the correct letter the game reveals a body part, even though it shouldnt. The code I have to test for the letters is as follows.

Negative 64818 pWe are creating a database with multiple entities that will use mailing addresses.  Some of those entities can have multiple addresses while others can only have a single address.  We decided to centralize the addresses in a single table called codeMailingAddresscode.  An example layout is shown below.p  precodeParty         PartyAddresses            MailingAddress         Letter                                PartyID PK  PartyID FK              MailingAddressID PK  LetterID PK PartyName     MailingAddressID PK,FK  StreetAddress          From                                         City                   To                                         State                  Subject                                         ZipCode                MailingAddressID FK codepre  pWe are having some debate over whether to only allow unique addresses in the MailingAddress table.  For example, if a Party has address code123 Main St, Anywhere, NYcode and a Letter has an address of code123 Main St, Anywhere, NYcode, then only have a single address record for code123 Main St, Anywhere, NYcode.p  pOne argument is that having any given address only once reduces the number of address records and is better form.  Basically, improved storage and table size.p  pThe other argument is that, while argument one is theoretically sound, the benefit is outweighed by the practical downfalls of this approach.  First, the performance penalty of having to code around the uniqueness.  For example, either handling the unique constraint violation on INSERT and querying for the exiting record, or querying for the existing record and inserting a new one if not found.  Additionally, if a record is updated, this process would need to be repeated because the existing address would need to be left intact in case it is being used by another entity.  Second, the increased risk of having to write this code.  It increases the possibility of a bug being introduced that updates and existing address that is used by another entity.p  pIn your experience, which is better  How does this relate to normalizationp  pEDITp  pActually, I misrepresented the PartyAddresses table, but have corrected it above.  It is actually meant as an extension table to allow a mailing address to be related to a party.  Basically, a Party can have multiple addresses, but in the current design, and address can only belong to one party.  Whether this is changed to a manytomany relationship depends on the answer to my original question.p  pYes, the mailing address can be updated.  There is actually no relationship between letter and party.  I should have explained that they are used by two different features of the system.  There are numerous entities in this system that need to have addresses assigned to them.  I included two here for illustration purposes Letter and Party.  There are more, but the fact that different entities have the same address does not make them logically related in this system.p

Negative 64818 pthis is about to be a super novice question.p  pIm learning htmljavascriptrelated stuff and am attempting to learn how to use XMLHttpsRequests. Most of my code I think is roughly correct, or at least can be easily corrected from available material out there thats easily accessible.p  pMy confusionquestion most directly relates to the codeopencode method of an XHR object. What do I pass as my second parameter url In the hands on guides Ive found people have been accessing their own websites and their own php files. The documentation however makes it sound like this second parameter can just be any url formatted as a string.p  pif I have my XHR object named codexmlHttpcode, codexmlHttp.openGET,httpwww.w3schools.comxmlnote.xml, truecodep  pis that valid if i then codexmlHttp.sendnullcode what will the server respond with Does this vary by website is there some way for me to specify what type of object gets sent backp  pI know this is a very broad question and Im basically asking for tutoring, but some answers regarding this lowlevel, pragmatic stuff would go a long way for me.p  pThanks a tonp

Negative 64818 pA simplified version of my problem is at a hrefhttpsgithub.comkaneseejqmdialogmobiscroll relnofollowgithuba.p  pIm using mobiscroll 2.6.2 since thats the last free version on github. Later versions up to 2.11 exists but are on different license.p  pBasically, I have an index page that does nothing but contains a link to a jQM dialog page. dialog.html is the jQM dialog page that has a single input, which the mobiscroll library turns into a popup scroller for selecting numbers.p  pThe mobiscroll works. The popup scroller appears when I select the input. I can select a number from the scroller and it populates the input with my selection. So Im pretty sure my initialization of mobiscroll is fine.

The value of 2 is not in the input. And when I popup the scroller, it defaults to the first value of 9.p  pMy guess is that its not a bug in mobiscroll, but rather my misunderstanding of jQM ajax navigation.

Negative 64818 pHow  can I make sure a project that is shown in my workspace is actually part of the workspace.  Below, I will explain what happened so that you know why Im asking this question.p  pI had checked out a project into my workspace, and then had configured it as a Maven project by selecting ConfigureConvert to Maven Project in most cases, when I do this, the project becomes part of the workspace.  But in this case it hadnt.  But I spent a few hours before realizing that I need to import the project in order for the workspace to recognize it as workspace project.  So, I want to avoid this situation and be able to look at a flag or file or something that tells me if a project that is shown in the Eclipse window is actually a workspace project.p  pThanks p  pIm adding the following to make the  problem more clearp  pThis is what I do I have a workspace with a few projects all JavaMaven project everything works. Then I checkout another project from svn into the workspace so, the folder of the new project is within the same workspace. I expected that as soon as I check out the new project into the workspace, and convert the new project into a Maven project, then the new project be recognized by Eclipse as one of the projects in the workspace. But that is not the case I actually have to import it.p  pThe project folder is there, and I can see it in the Project explorer. Nothing happens to it, but it is not used by the workspace. For example, if I add breakpoints to the Java files which are in the new project, they are not used. At this point, I use FileImport menu to import the project from the same folder that is already in the workspace, and bang, it starts working, and my breakpoints work.p  pIs my procedure for checking out a project from SVN into the workspace wrong I want to fix my procedure to make sure this will never happen. Do you think that even though the new project is a subfolder of workspace, I should still need to import the project into the workspacep  hr  pI just noted another fact this particular project that Im importing is a Maven multimodule could it be that the parent project is actually part of the workspace, but the modules inside it are not therefore, just because it is a Maven multimodule, I need to import the submodules.p

Negative 64818 pIm trying to make a UV sphere in C using Qt Creator, I want to build the sphere without using the openGL commands. Im  trying trying to add the vertices to lObject and then add the normals and triangles. The sphere will have a radius of 1.

Negative 64818 pI am building a catalogue web application online shopping like amazon, ebay and I am using the MEAN stack to serve the data. I have all the product information stored in the mongo.p  pWhat I want to do is that, when a user wants to buy a product i.e. he clicks on the buy button, he should be redirected to another server running MySQL and tomcat for the rest of the procedure. In other words, I want to handle the user orders on the java and mySQL side. I also want to authenticate the user at this point of time i.e. manage sessions.p  pIn this scenario, obviously I can not share session info across the two servers. So, my question is that how do I provide transparency to the user I dont want the user to know that he is being served by a different server when placing an order.p  pThe primary aim here is to let the user browse the catalogue freely and place order, without letting him know that he is being served by two servers.p

I have created a data frame with the stocks, and a summary data frame, masterdfex, and masterdfexsum, respectively.p  pThe goal is to create something each day that has equal long and shorts, and thus for each day, the sum of the lsflag  0.p  pFor masterdfex, there is a rank by strength of magnitude column, up or down column, then a long or short column.  p  pThe lsflag is set by the updnflag for the stocks that are ranked in the top half in this case, since we have 4 per day, rank  1 and rank  2 are set by updnflag.p  pstrongI need to create a process to fill in the NAs in the lsflag.strong  p  pMy thinking is to create a summary table, where i run a summary,replace the contents, until both the NA are 0 and the sum of the lsflag 0.p  pFor example, here is the current datap  precodeasofdtltrepseqas.Date20141001, as.Date20141003, days,4 rankmagltrepseq1,4,3 updnflagltc1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 lsflagltc1,1,NA,NA,1,1,NA,NA,1,1,NA,NA masterdfexltdata.frameasofdt,rankmag,updnflag,lsflag masterdfexltarrangemasterdfex,asofdt,rankmag masterdfexsumltsummarisemasterdf,totflag  sumlsflag, na.rm  TRUE,                         totNA  sumis.nalsflag    gt masterdfex       asofdt rankmag updnflag lsflag 1  20141001        1        1      1 2  20141001        2         1       1 3  20141001        3         1      NA 4  20141001        4         1      NA 5  20141002        1        1      1 6  20141002        2        1      1 7  20141002        3        1      NA 8  20141002        4         1      NA 9  20141003        1         1       1 10 20141003        2         1       1 11 20141003        3         1      NA 12 20141003        4        1      NA gt masterdfexsum Source local data frame [3 x 3]   asofdt totflag totNA 1 20141001        0      2 2 20141002       2      2 3 20141003        2      2 codepre  pFor 20141002, since the the totflag  2, the NAs for this date should both be 1p  pFor 20141003, since the totflag  2, the NAs should both be 1p  pFor 20141001 hardest onep  pThe logic should look at 20141001 in masterdfexsum, since totNA is not 0, go into masterdfex and find the lowest rank by rankmag where lsflag is NA.

Also, it breaks sometimes down from 30 FPS to 26, which I want to avoid.

Negative 64818 pI use GDB to debug an embedded linux target board. On target board gdbserver is running the stripped binary application. On PC side I run application which has debug symbols attached.p  pFrom PC via ethernet connection I do target remote ipport and there is a healthy connection to gdbserver. I add break points in some functions and continue. Debugger successfully break as expected when I trigger external event and program breaks in my simple function. Weird behaviour starts at this point. When I do step or next in GDB console instead of next line it goes to previous line than goes to two lines forward and goes back two lines backward. Each time I do next or step this continues. There is no loops or jumps, code should just go line by line but it doesnt. Why GDB behaves like this What should I do to solve this problem.p

Negative 64818 pI am essentially doing face recognition and verification in Java, testing with PCA and then WMPCA. I have PCA fully implemented however it runs incredibly slow, 15 minutes to train a 7900 image data set.p  pI have looked at where the longest delays are, some are unavoidable such as preprocessing the data get face region, grayscale, resize, store. However the main delays are in the Matrix calculations.p  pThe first big delay is during the calculation of the Covariance matrix and then getting the eigenvalues and eigenvectors from the covariance matrix. I am currently using the Apache libraries to achieve this, but it seems to be single threaded and only consumes 15 CPU while calculating this. It runs very slow and although I have found possible alternatives for the eigenvectors and eigenvalues decomposition, I cannot find an alternative fast library for the covariance matrix calculation.p  pHere is the code snippet for when I calculate what I describe abovep  precode    Log.appendComputing covariance matrix...

Both these libraries have been reviewed to be incredibly slow and I guess an alternative may be a library such as JBlas, but this will only speed up this section.p  pI do not want to run into the issue where I spend a long time converting between the data formats required for each library.p  pDoes anyone know any Java solutions to the computation of the covariance matrix and then the eigendecomposition This seems to be the main bottleneck.p

But instead I started making an online store from OpenCart. I watched some youtube videos and added some products, categories etc. Now I am strucked and lost my sleep, because there is no proper explanation on the web. The Problem is On the product page I have a category of Reward Points for many products. But only thing visible on the category page is image, price, short description, Add to Cart option.

Negative 64818 pI was looking for some assistance. I am very new to Angular, but I have searched and havent been able to find an answer. The basic situation is that I have 5 input boxes. As these are changed the data in a table changes. However, I have a row of data that is dependent on the prior cell, so if A  1, B  A  2, C  B 1, etc. I would prefer not to repeat all the crazy math I have to get the number for cell A. I have tried adding codengmodelcode to the html cells which of course has no affect once the page is first initialized. Is there a way to bind a cells contents to the prior cells contents without having an input of some kind Thanksp  pHere is a sample of what Im trying to do in code formp  precodeltinput typetext ngmodelvalue1gtltbrgt ltinput typetext ngmodelvalue2gtltbrgt  ltp ngmodelvalue3gtvalue1  value2ltpgt ltpgtvalue 3  value1ltpgt codepre  pThis is a very simplified version, but the gist is there. so no it isnt as simple as having the 2nd codeltpgtcode be codevalue3  2  value1  value2codep

Negative 64818 pI have been working recently on a website in meteor and have come to the point of adding ads from Google AdSense. Navigation between pages is done with iron router. I added AdSense with .getScript similar to the discussions in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14885846addinggoogleadsensetometeorapplicationAdding Google Adsense to Meteor Applicationa. The actual advert is part of the template to make it reload when you switch pages, but I noticed the adverts would stop showing after clicking around some pages.p  pDigging into this for a while I found that AdSense does not support Ajax navigation. My current solution is to force the page to reload by inside a click handler for links assigning location.href  event.target.href or some hard coded link p  pThe page is live here a hrefhttpwww.convertercentral.com relnofollowhttpwww.convertercentral.comap  pThis works pretty good since the template would be loaded instantly as usual by iron router, before the true page reload, then followed by a true refresh as if pushing F5. Furthermore, with some caching this refresh would be almost invisible except for the adverts.p  pStill, this feels very dirty, and breaks the point of iron router quite badly. Since most sites would have adverts I just figured there has to be a better way. I have seen some threads about Ajax navigation and AdSense but they were mostly outdated. Does anyone have experience from similar situations p

Did anyone solve that problemp  blockquote   pmetadata field You can see that were passing options to the share   method. This contains two fields we want to send back to Messenger   metadata and contextOverride.p      pThe metadata field takes a NSString and is optional. It can be used to   give information about the content being shared. For example, you can   store a serialized JSON string. This is useful during replies as this   data is passed back to your app.p blockquote  pa hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsmessengeriosbpusingmetadata relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsmessengeriosbpusingmetadataap

Negative 64818 pI have a project with the following structurep  precodemain    pom.xml module1    pom.xml module2    pom.xml module3    pom.xml module4    pom.xml pom.xml codepre  pThe modules uses codeServiceLoadercode mechanism to register their services. The main class is in codemaincode module which is also responsible for loading the services in classpath using codeServiceLoadercode mechanism. The problem is that the codemaincode module is not aware of codemodule1code, codemodule2code, codemodule3code and codemodule4code because theyre installed by the user independently. What I want to to is to add all the classes in these modules to classpath when starting the program so that ServiceLoader will be aware of the services in these modules.p  pCurrently, Im loading these modules at runtime from codemaincode module but it doesnt seem to be good way of solving this problem because the IDE doesnt aware of these modules and it seems that it takes much more time to load these modules at runtime. I have looked at how modular Java projects like Elasticsearch and PrestoDB handle this problem but it seems they both load the installed modules at runtime.p  pHow do you handle this problem when developing modular Java applications Lets say I have a directory called plugins that has the jar files of the modules the user installed, is there any way to start the application with the classpath that contains all the jars in that directory using a maven plugin Or do I have to load these jars at runtimep

Negative 64818 pI am working on a bug of our games and after many days of researching, I still cannot found the any good solution for it.p  pDevice for debugging is Window Tablet.p  pThe application run on Window Store using Window Runtime 8.1. UI created by flash and all user interaction occur inside it. Note that we do not use window standard control, we draw our own control.p  pSo to create a textbox, we draw a textbox in Flash Lets call it FTextBox. Then we create another textbox control invisible for user ITextBox. When the FTextBox is focused, we will focus the ITextBox respectively.p  pNow, if the user focus our textbox using touch or pen then everything is fine. The virtual keyboard appear and disappear when we want it to.p  pThe problem occur when the user plugin a mouse and use it. Then the virtual keyboard stop appearing.p  pWe know that this is the OS problem. It will disable virtual keyboard if user focus textbox using mouse. However, if after that, we touch and focus the FTextbox by hand, the textbox will be focused but the virtual keyboard will refuse to appear.p  pThe only way to the virtual keyboard to reappear again is by touching the ITextbox with finger directly, which is not possible as it is currently hidden away from user.p  pWe have been stuck on this problem for quite some time and we really need your help.

Negative 64818 pI know this is a very basic question, but I am always trying to find ways to make my code a clean and concise as possible. Is there a way to compare the equality of three or more strings in a single codeifcode statement I am currently using the codeampampcode operator to progressively compare each string. However, as you could imagine, between long variable names and methods being called, these codeifcode statements get very cluttered very quickly. Additionally I am planning to have an unknown number of these Strings, and would like to avoid complex codeforcode loops with cluttered codeifcodes nested inside of them. This is what my code currently looks likep  precodeString a  new Stringa String b  new Stringb String c  new Stringc ifa.equalsb ampamp b.equalsc      doSomething  codepre  pIs there a way, or a collection of some sort that I can use that would allow me to compare these values more like thisp  precodeifa.equalsb.equalsc      doSomething  codepre
Negative 64818 pSince WCF routing doesnt support routing for REST services, I created a REST service that has one enpoint which accepts all incoming requests and than redirects those requests based on the query parameters.br I did this by following this article a hrefhttpblog.tonysneed.com20120424rollyourownrestfulwcfrouter relnofollowhttpblog.tonysneed.com20120424rollyourownrestfulwcfroutera.p  pThis approach works for passing through requests and returning the results. The problem is whenever I get an error, like a 404, from the actual service the message that is returned to the client is a 400 Bad Request.br What I would like to have is a routing proxy that actually just redirects the calls to the real service based on the query and returns all the errors to the client as they come from the real service.p  pIs this even the right approach to what Im trying to accomplish, or are there easier or better solutionsp  pAny help is appreciated      p  pIn the following I added what my code looks like.br app.config  p  precodelt   System.net gt ltsystem.netgt ltsettingsgt   ltservicePointManager expect100Continuefalse useNagleAlgorithmfalse gt ltsettingsgt ltconnectionManagementgt   ltadd address maxconnection24 gt ltconnectionManagementgt ltsystem.netgt  lt    System.ServiceModel  gt ltsystem.serviceModelgt  lt      Services  gt ltservicesgt   ltservice nameRoutingGateway.RoutingServicegt     ltendpoint addressapirouting bindingwebHttpBinding bindingConfigurationsecureWebHttpBinding contractRoutingGateway.IRoutingService behaviorConfigurationRESTBehaviour gt   ltservicegt ltservicesgt  ltclientgt   ltendpoint bindingwebHttpBinding bindingConfigurationsecureWebHttpBinding contractRoutingGateway.IRoutingService nameroutingService behaviorConfigurationRESTBehaviour gt ltclientgt  lt      Bindings gt ltbindingsgt   ltwebHttpBindinggt     ltbinding namesecureWebHttpBinding hostNameComparisonModeStrongWildcard maxReceivedMessageSize2147483647 transferModeStreamedgt       ltsecurity modeTransportgt         lttransport clientCredentialTypeNone gt       ltsecuritygt     ltbindinggt   ltwebHttpBindinggt ltbindingsgt  lt      Behaviors gt ltbehaviorsgt   ltendpointBehaviorsgt     ltbehavior nameRESTBehaviourgt       ltdispatcherSynchronization asynchronousSendEnabledtrue gt       ltwebHttp helpEnabledtrue gt     ltbehaviorgt   ltendpointBehaviorsgt    ltserviceBehaviorsgt     ltbehaviorgt       lt To avoid disclosing metadata information, set the value below to false before deployment gt       ltserviceMetadata httpsGetEnabledfalse gt       lt To receive exception details in faults for debugging purposes, set the value below to true.

Negative 64818 pI have some script that I like to run sometimes during the rebase process to help with some special merging.  From this script I need to determine what the rebase head is.p  pFor instance, with merging, there is a reference MERGEHEAD that points to the other commit that is being merged in.  However, when rebasing there is no REBASEHEAD that I can point to during merge conflicts.  But it looks like ORIGHEAD may be what I need if I was only rebasing one commit, but probably not multiple commits as it would not move with each successive rebase commit application.  I also see that there is a em.gitrebaseapplyem folder which may have the information I need in the emoriginalcommitem file, but there is no documentation on this internal stuff and would not want to rely on it not changing see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21548502documentaboutfilesingitrebaseapplydirectoryDocument about files in .gitrebaseapply directorya.p  pI will mention that, when I run this script, it may be during an ongoing rebase and it needs to determine this information programmatically, so I cant simply open a log and find the commit I want at a particular point in time.p

I think that is more than my situation requires, and I would like know if my thinking is correct.p  pThis application is nothing more than an API that sends JSON to the client application. There are static files for an admin page, but that page is for developers only, so extremely low traffic.

Because the base location is coded as codecode, the browser assumes all the files and directories are in the root of the C drive.  p  pIs there a way to simulate the site on a Windows PC so that all images and CSS are loaded correctly  I thought about creating a new partition and putting everything in the root of that partition but wanted to know if there was an easier way.p

Negative 64818 pI have a web application that has a number of dialogs that pop up that contain controls that modify various attributes of a data model.

a font with size 0.5, but suddenly bail out and return bounds with a height of 0.0 for the font with size 0.4.p  pSide note I wonder whether this is simply a bug  although it might be caused by some internal roundofferrors, as it happens exactly between font sizes of 0.5 and 0.49 ...p  pThe only solutions that work for these smaller fonts are the computation using a GlyphVector, or the TextLayout. But both of these approaches are tremendously expensive, as they require the creation of the Shape of the string and lots of auxiliary objects. Furthermore, they only return the emvisualem bounds that is, the bounds of the actual shape, and not the emlogicalem bounds of the text.p  pIs there any strongefficientstrong solution for computing the logical bounds of strings in small fontsp

The code below is working, but it only displays the last image in the array as it loops without pausing.  Is there a way to pause a jQuery .each  Or is it my design in the first place  I know that this loop will only run once.  I planned on solving that problem once I got this bit of code to work.

The maximum file size should be 100kb..p  pWere using 2 ways to publish our banners. One is with google doubleclick and the other one is direct publishing on websites.p  pWe got no problem with doubleklick, because they say, that the initial load should be under 100kb and the rest could be loaded after that.p  pBut the publishers for the direct publishing are saying, that the whole banner all files which are used and compressed as a zip should be max. 100kb.p  pOur client has got some designing guidelines, so we have to include the font which contains 4 formats and 2 font types. But even the font has 400kb.p  pSo the only way we have at the moment is, to convert the text into pictures, to keep the filesize down..

Negative 64818 pIve got a database which amongst others has two tables of datap  pstrongTable 1strongp  ul liProductIDli liProductNameli liProductDescriptionli liIsVisibleli liIsDeletedli ul  pstrongTable 2strong   ProductPriceID   ProductID   LocationID   Pricep  pTable 2 can hold many prices at different locations for each product in Table 1. Im reading from a CSV file where the product details are listed in the first columns followed by 15 columns of price values for 15 locations.p  pI have found that with some nearly 10,000 products being imported each time, that writing this file to the database by first writing the product, and then writing a list of the 15 prices to Table 2, 10000 times over slows the import down HUGELY. It slows it down by up to 2.5x compared to attempting to write in a list of 10000 products first, followed by the some 132,000 product prices. Having 2 writes to the database massively speeds up the whole process, as the lag time is incurred at the database so writing 2 times instead of 20,000 times is much easier.p  pIve created to lists of the Database types for each object and added the data to each and this is fine. The problem is the ProductID in Table 2. Entity Framework doesnt return this until I callp  precodecontext.Products.AddproductList context.Save codepre  pBut at the point this is saved, the list of product prices has already been created but without the relevant ProductID values. When it saves, it crashes because of the foreign key constraint.p  pIs there anyway with Entity Framework to get the ProductID, that will be assigned to this product without writing each product to the database first Minimum numbers of database calls is crucial here.p  pI have the option of reparsing all the data from the file, but Im also not keen on this, as its extra processing time. The structure of the file will not be able to be changed.p

I then need to display the objects from all the lists as one huge mixed list for the user, with all the various objects sorted by date. p  pI made an adapter that extends baseadapter and Ive passed all the arraylists of objects to that adapter  but how can I sort all these lists of objects by date and display them all together I could create a super object that has the properties of all the other objects and then make one sorted array of this super object to pass to the adapter, but that seems like a messy and crude solution. Is there a more or less elegant way to do thisp  precodepublic class someAdapter extends BaseAdapter  ...  public someAdapterArrayListltObjectOnegt objectOneArray, ArrayListltObjectTwogt objectTwoArray          if objectOneArray  null              this.localObjectOneList.addAllobjectOneArray                  ...   codepre  pExample of an object typep  precodepublic class ObjectOne implements Serializable  private String date private String someFieldOne private String someFieldTwo  ... getters and setters ...  codepre  pTo reiterate  the final list has to be a mix of all the different object types in the order of their dates. p
