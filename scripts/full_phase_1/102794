Positive 102794 pSo, this is the problem that Im trying to solve using background agents I need to continue on logging the user location when he goes offline in background even after device reset thing of a running app for context.p  pTo try and solve this Ive used a Periodic task from a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsappshh202941vvs.105.aspx relnofollowthis approacha wordforword, which did work in debug mode. But, as I left the phone unattended overnight Ive had only one log for the user after half an hour of leaving the phone. No further entries have been recorded have in mind that Ive used test log entry and not real GPS signal, which means I only triggered simple log writing for test purposes.p  pAm I missing something Is this not a valid solution for this problem. If so, could you please provide a reason for this, as I was unable to find any documentation that speaks of that sort of limitation.p

Negative 102794 pI want to make use of some of the ASP.NET 3.5 capability within SharePoint 2007.  In particular, I want to do the followingp  ul liProvide REST and maybe JSON through HTTP so that another product can consume SharePoint content.li liProvide AJAX web parts within SharePoint.  These will probably have little to no server side controls.  Most content will be loaded using Javascript and hitting an external system primarily not SharePoint over HTTP that provides REST or JSON.li liProvide this capability as a product.  This is not a oneoff solution for a single implementation.li ul  pMy main concern is pushback from IT groups not wanting to change their SharePoint environment to allow for the product to work.  So, Id prefer to be able to say that what Im doing is supported by Microsoft, but Im not sure that will be the case.p  pI realize that I could create a separate nonSharePoint web site on the SharePoint servers for WCF endpoints that provide SharePoint data to an external application.  I would rather not do this because that wont help my web parts if they need help and that makes deployment harder.  Proper SharePoint deployment will automatically have SharePoint update all necessary files e.g., web.config on any new web front end added to the farm and this wouldnt follow that pattern.  In addition, Id lose the ability to use SPContext.Current.p  pI have read much of Daniel Larsons book on a hrefhttpwww.microsoft.comlearningenusbooks12793.aspx relnofollowDeveloping ServiceOriented AJAX Applications on the Microsoft Platforma good read, BTW, esp. Chapter 11 on extending SharePoint.  He outlines WCF, ASMX, and HTTP Handler options and for the most part recommends the HTTP Handler option.

Negative 102794 pI want to partially specialize an existing template that I cannot change codestdtr1hashcode for a base class and all derived classes. The reason is that Im using the curiouslyrecurring template pattern for polymorphism, and the hash function is implemented in the CRTP base class. If I only want to partially specialize for a the CRTP base class, then its easy, I can just writep  precode namespace std  namespace tr1   template lttypename Derived struct hashltCRTPBaseltDerived       sizet operatorconst CRTPBaseltDerived  base const                return base.hash           codepre  pBut this specialization doesnt match actual derived classes, only codeCRTPBaseltDerivedgtcode. What I want is a way of writing a partial specialization for codeDerivedcode if and only if it derives from codeCRTPBaseltDerivedgtcode. My pseudocode isp  precode namespace std  namespace tr1   template lttypename Derived struct hashlttypename boostenableifltstdtr1isbaseofltCRTPBaseltDerived, Derived,     Derivedtype      sizet operatorconst CRTPBaseltDerived  base const                return base.hash           codepre  p...but that doesnt work because the compiler cant tell that codeenableifltcondition, Derivedgttypecode is codeDerivedcode. If I could change codestdtr1hashcode, Id just add another dummy template parameter to use codeboostenableifcode, as recommended by the codeenableifcode documentation, but thats obviously not a very good solution. Is there a way around this problem Do I have to specify a custom hash template on every codeunorderedsetcode or codeunorderedmapcode I create, or fully specialize codehashcode for every derived classp

Negative 102794 pI am about to start making a simple little video editing application, and I was trying to decide what system to create the GUI in.  I know a lot about the Windows API, and actually, all of my programs thus far have been written in it.  I would really like to use the new WPF framework though however, I am a bit concerned about the fact that C may not be ideal for a performanceoriented application.  And Im not positive, but I dont think it is possible to use SIMD instructions in C  Of course, my video editing program will use DirectX, and then Ive read about problems of using that in C.  So then I had the idea that maybe Id write the core of the program in C and somehow link it to its GUI through DLLs or something.  Of course, that could be really messy... Any ideas  Thanksp

Negative 102794 pOf course, I know the best answer is dont write your own crossplatform code, someone has already done what you need, but Im doing this as a hobbylearning exercise and not in any paid capacity.  Basically, Im writing a smallish console application in C, and Id like to make it cross platform, dealing with things like files, sockets, and threads.  OOP seems like a great way to handle this, but I havent really found a good pattern for writing classes that share the same interface cross platform.p  pThe easy approach is to just plan out some metainterface, use that throughout the rest of the program, and just compile the same class with different files depending on the platform, but I feel like theres got to be a better way thats more elegant at the very least, something that doesnt confuse IntelliSense and its ilk would be nice.p  pIve taken a look at some of the smaller classes in the wxWidgets source, and they use an approach that uses a private member holding data for the class, e.gp  precodeclass Foo      public         Foo          void Bar     private         FooData data  codepre  pYou can then compile this by simply choosing different implementation files depending on the platform.  This approach seems pretty clunky to me.p  pAnother approach Ive considered is writing an interface, and swapping out classes that inherit from that interface depending on the platform.  Something like thisp  precodeclass Foo      public         virtual Foo          virtual void Bar  0   class Win32Foo      public         Win32Foo         Win32Foo         void Bar  codepre  pOf course this kind of screws up the actual instantiation since you dont know which implementation to create an object of, but that can be worked around by using a functionp  precodeFoo CreateFoo codepre  pand varying the implementation of the function based on which platform youre running on.  Im not a huge fan of this either, because it still seems clunky littering the code with a bunch of instantiation method and this would also be inconsistent with the method of creating noncrossplatform objects.p  pWhich of these two approaches is better  Is there a better wayp  pstrongEditstrong To clarify, my question is not How do you write crossplatform C  Rather, its What is the best method to abstract away crossplatform code using classes in C, while retaining as much benefit from the type system as possiblep

Most things I am reading are telling to use WS and HTTP.pli lipIs Net.Tcp secured by standard and without certificates  that is  people cannot listen on the wire and decode the data thats going to and from.pli lipIs it possible to send a username and password using net.tcp and without an installed certificatepli lipIf so I presume I can hook this up to my membership provider and authenticate access to each method on my service contract implementation.pli lipI presume that with username and password security, the proxy is initialised with the username and password and that this information is is sent with every request.pli lipThen my membership provider will be invoked for each method call and do whatever it needs to do to get the authorisation for the method.pli ul  pSorry for the dump of questions but would be great to know if Im thinking the right way about how WCF works.p  pThanks.p

Negative 102794 pIve been designing a site over the past couple days, and been doing some research into different aspects of scaling a site horizontally.  If things go as planned, in a few months years I know Id need to worry about scaling the site up and out, since the resources it would end up consuming would be huge.p  pSo, this got me to thinking, when is the best time to start thinking about, and designing for, scalability  If you start too early on, you could easily over complicate your design, and make it impossible to actually build. You could also get too caught up in the details, the architecture, whatever, and wind up getting nothing done.  Also, if you do get it working, but the site never takes off, you may have wasted a good chunk of extra effort.p  pOn the other hand, you could be saving yourself a ton of effort down the road.  Designing it from the ground up to be big would make it much easier later on to let it grow big, with very little rewriting going on.p  pI know for what Im working on, Ive decided to make at least a few choices now on the side of scaling, but Im not going to do a complete change of thinking to get it to scale completely.  Notably, Ive redesigned my database from a conventional relational design to one similar to what was suggested on the Reddit site linked below, and Im going to give memcache a try.p  pSo, the basic question, strongwhen is a good time to start thinking or worrying about scaling, and what are some good designs, tips, etc. for when doing sostrongp  pA couple of things Ive been reading, for those who are interestedp  pa hrefhttpwww.codinghorror.comblog200906scalingupvsscalingouthiddencosts.htmlhttpwww.codinghorror.comblog200906scalingupvsscalingouthiddencosts.htmlap  pa hrefhttphighscalability.comblog20105177lessonslearnedwhilebuildingredditto270millionpage.htmlhttphighscalability.comblog20105177lessonslearnedwhilebuildingredditto270millionpage.htmlap  pa hrefhttpdeveloper.yahoo.comperformancerules.htmlhttpdeveloper.yahoo.comperformancerules.htmlap

Negative 102794 pIm experiencing something recently that is really annoying and I cant figure out why its doing it.  Not sure when it started, because I recently wiped my machine, so maybe its a recent update or maybe its from a while ago.p  pEither way, here is whats happening.  When Im declaring an anonymous function inline and start typing the function  ...  part, the VS2010 intellisense comes up and replaces my lowercase function with its own capitalized Function.  I guess this is some static function in JavaScript or JScript or something else, but I dont know.  Either way, its when I type the  that it assumes thats what I want.p  pIf Im declaring a standalone function it isnt affected because I dont put the  after that, so it just leaves what I type.p  pHere are some screen shots of what is happening.br img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com01m7j.png altjavascript intellisenseimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHsmuP.png altenter image description herep  pIt is quite frustrating because I dont notice it each time and then, of course, the function doesnt execute.  I also work in VS2008 each day and in 2008, both the function and Function are listed in the intellisense menu, but it defaults to the lowercase one so it doesnt affect me.p  pIs there any way I can override the intellisense settings  Find a file and remove the Function one from the list because Ill never use it  Make it default back to the lowercase function choicep  pAny help would be great.

Also, it is not consistent. Sometimes the adding or removing elements triggers the white flash, and other times it does not.p  pIm assuming this is just an issue with the way FF redraws the page. p  pI know my question may be a little vague, but I wasnt sure if anyone has had experience with this or has any suggestions.

Negative 102794 pI have a view that calls on four different partial views .ascx to populate a portion of the view via RenderAction call.  Each of the partial views use the same view model, but each returns a different set of data via their own EF query in the underlying model.

New Products vs. Popular Products vs. Recommended Products, etc.p  pIm getting the data that I want, but I need to address the structure because my performance is pretty poor.  The performance of each individual query doesnt seem too bad Ive used LinqPad and tested the generated SQL in SQL Server and the performance is great.

Only one time in production it happened to see the following error p  pemA connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the login process. provider Named Pipes Provider, error 0  No process is on the other end of the pipe..em p  pThe reason for having this error is clear if we use named pipes protocol because we havent enabled them on the server. But my question here is why named pipes protocol could be used here In the connection string we have used emData Source.SQLEXPRESSem. Having in mind the information in msdn and over the internet my understanding is that when . is used always the Shared Memory Protocol must be used. So what must happen so that ADO.NET SqlClient decides to use Named Pipe Protocol insteadp  pMost of the times everything is working just fine, but I need to know the process so that we can prevent any further errors of this type if needed.p  pThanks in advance,  Todorp
Negative 102794 pI would like to display XY data on a canvas using lines with a certain width in pixels, or dp ideally. I have tried the setStrokeWidth.. method of Paint, and that indeed does change the line width but it isnt what I need. In my case Ive scaled my canvas to real Engineering units using matrix.preScalexScale, yScale so the X scale represents 0 to 100 and the Y is 0 to 1. The setStrokeWidth method of the Paint object seems to set the stroke so that it follows my matrix preScale settings. In other words, horizontal lines are drawn really thin, and vertical lines are drawn really thick.p  pIs there a way to configure the Paint so that no matter which direction the line is drawn, its width is a consistent number of pixelsp  pI have tried defining a Drawable that is a line, and making a ShapeDrawable from that, and then applying it to the Paint but ran into some nasty class casting errors at run time. This made me think that this was the wrong way to go about it. But maybe I gave up too soon.p  pI understand that are a number of Android plottingcharting packages available, some with source, but Im really looking to understand the platform here, rather than using a thirdparty solution.  p  pThanks for any hints Richp
Negative 102794 pI would like to show a popup dialog to notify a user that server data is being accessed from an iPad app, specifically over top of a split view controller. Is the best way to do this with a separate controller that is presented modally The view controller guide indicates that modal view controllers are full screen transitions, so not used often in iPad apps, so Im wondering if there is a better approach, since I would simply want to create a semi transparent background with the activity indicator and message.p  pI dont want to just use one of the split views two controllers, however, because it doesnt seem the right approach. p

When zooming out how ever to say a more global overview of the UK, the icon itself appears on the right of the M1  but no processing is happening to the markers during this phase  so it cannot be the marker moving.p  pIs this actually down to googles map images being slightly different at higher zoom levels, or is there something in the markers side of things that can affect thisp  pLike I said  everything IS working, it just seems a bit strange zooming in and seeing the map tiles change position slightly whereas the marker remains constantp  pCheersp

However Im now trying to feed it input data from a remote machine. Ive created an NTFS symlinked folder to the remote host on my local drive. So when my machine accesses CMyFolder it transparently accesses NetworkComputerMySharedFolder. So far so goodp  pHowevermy program crashes with a The system cannot open the file. IOException. This seems to map to ERRORTOOMANYOPENFILES. As far as I know I only have one file open at a given time, so the exception doesnt make sense. p  pAfter some more debugging I found out the following using the process explorer.p  pWhen running locally the process starts with 400 handles probably because of .NET then when I press the start button the number of handles increases to 600 quickly, then it decreases to 400, then rises to 600, etc... This is probably the Garbage Collector kicking in, keeping the number of file handles down. When the process is done processing the files the number of file handles returns nicely to 400.p  pWhen reading files from the remote machine I see in the emlocal process monitorem the exact same behavior. However in the emprocess monitor on the remote machineem I see the number of file handles rise with about 1800, never decreasing, until the program crashes. The file handle number increase on the remote machine directly corresponds with the number of processed files.p  pstrongTLDRstrong So this is my question emHow can I avoid having dangling file handles on a remote machine when accessing it trough a symlinkemp  pEditp  pSometimes another exception shows up IOException Not enough server storage is available to process this command.

Negative 102794 pI would like to know what I need to bear in mind if I create libraries that can run either on a .NET Framework 3.5 or .NET Framework 4.0 installed runtime. I want some backward compatibility like Enterprise Library does but only with 3.5 nothing before that. I saw that theyve compiled the libraries on 3.5 but is able to run on 4.0 apps. I would like the same effect, hopefully with strongMINIMALstrong project maintenance effort. I hope my question is clear enough. Please let me know via a comment if not.p  pEDIT I found that if I set the app.config to recognize both the 2.0 and 4.0 runtimes, my EXE actually runs fine on either runtimes. I tested it by uninstalling both .NET 3.5 and 4.0 individually to see if each one can separately run it. There might be some things to take into account using each of those frameworks but for small toolish types of apps and libs, I think it should be fine. Anyone to disagreep  pThanksp

Negative 102794 pIm new to OLAP, so perhaps I dont know the right terminology to use for this question, but bear with me here.p  pI work with lots of hierarchical, multidimensional data where parentaggregated cells mostly have data, but childleaf cells are often missing data attribute values are unknown but nonzero.

I can create decent estimates, but need to adjust them so they conform to known parentschildren across all dimensions and levels this is much harder than it sounds. I am already doing this, but it involves pulling the data out of the RDBMS into a custom executable.li liQueries and calculations need to be able to handle the unknowns properly. Ideally be able to easily query how much of an aggregated cells value is made up of estimated vs. known values, possibly compute confidenceerror statistics, or check whether we can derive an exact value for an unknown when it has a known parent and all known siblings, etc.li liData can be large... up to tens of millions of fact table rows.

Negative 102794 pIve recently started developing in Java coming from .Net.

Again, not sure how to address that.p  pAny help or guidance would be much appreciated Thank youp

Negative 102794 pI am trying to implement a python build package and functional testing package for our internal software development processes.  My primary goal is to implement a globalstandard logger similar to the reference a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6150158globalloggerhowtoimplementherea and argparser that all modules will use from within their perspective packages i.e. the build logger and parser will differ from the test suite logger and parser.p  pShould this be done in codeinit.pycode of the package  Are there any other methods to achieve this  I have yet to see what the real need for codeinit.pycode is  Perhaps, this answered my own question p  pI have written numerous python modules and other apps, but never packageslibraries.  This concept seems to introduce new possibilities for me, such as standardizing these processes.p  pBasically, to summarize, my goals for these packages arep  p1. Eliminate the need for redundant passingparsing of long lists of arguments andor accessing the system environment.p  p2. Eliminate the myriad of outputs that weve seen in the past from varying tests and build scripts.p  p3. Provide a selfdocumenting package that will be easy to use.  Any advice on package documentation would be extremely useful, as well. p  pThis will enable users of these packages top  p1. Easily access a standard set of arguments.  For example, every module in the package will in order of precedence parse commandline arguments with standard flags, load a config file, or use default values.p  p2. Easily log errors, warnings, and debug statements in a standard way.p  p3. As these testbuild modules are passed around, this will ultimately enable users i.e. someone who did not write the module to run it in a universal way.p  pI suppose I am looking for some real Pythonic implementation advice because the variety of options and possibilities out there seem to be overwhelming.  Thanks in advance.p
Negative 102794 pI am trying To show a dialog from a PreferenceActivity, which is set to Theme.Light.  The dialog shows with dark text on a dark backgroundp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9lvH1.png altenter image description herep  pI assume it uses dark text because it is inheriting the text color from the parent activity, or something similar.  I would like the dialog to either use white text on the dark background, or use a white background with dark text, as the PreferenceActivity does when set to Theme.Light.p  pThis seems to be a known problem, the workarounds I have found involve creating and using a custom style that extends Theme.Dialog and using it to instantiate the dialog.  Something like p  precodeltstyle nameCustomDialog parentandroidstyleTheme.Dialoggt ltitem nameandroidtextColorgtandroidattrtextColorPrimaryInverseDisableOnlyltitemgt ltstylegt  Dialog dialog  new Dialogcontext, R.style.CustomDialog codepre  pI tried this, but it made no difference.  I also tried a number of different values for textColor, none of which modified the Dialogs text color.  As a sanity check, I addedp  precode     ltitem nameandroidbackgroundgtFFFF0000ltitemgt codepre  pto the style, which resulted in a dialog with a red background so I am sure that I am instantiating the dialog properly.p  pThe closest I have come to a solution is just setting the dialogs background color to white, which gives the below dialog.  But this is not a good solution, because some version or some device might not use the same behavior I am seeing when inverting text colorp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comh2l6i.png altenter image description herep  pSo, is there a good way to set text color on a dialog displayed from a Theme.Light activityp

Negative 102794 pWhat Im trying to do is use SHA1 UTF8 encryption and then base64 encoding and  on a password string value.

Negative 102794 pWhat I really want to do is to allow a user to create a map with google maps and save the image.  I have attempted a work around that does this by using the google maps api V3 and also the static maps api. p  pThe user can use the dynamic google map to scroll, zoom, etc and find a map they like.  The user should then press a button which extracts the data from the google map center, zoom level, etc which sends the query to the static google map api.  The static google map api will then return the image which can be saved.p  pI have this all working except it doesnt always work.  Sometimes the images returned by static google maps will be exactly what the user sees in the dynamic map.  Other times the image may be off by a few meters I believe this is because the dynamic google map api uses greater precision for longitude and latitude than the static api, or even thousands of kilometers I have no idea why this happens.  The images are usually off the greater the zoom level is because of the precision differences.p  pI want to know if anyone has tried converting a dynamic map to a static map and came up with a nonbuggy solution, or if there is a better solution that works.p

Negative 102794 pIve been trying to implement the Facebook SDK into my application in order to let users post messages on our fanwall through the app. However, Ive been unsuccessful at even logging the user in through the SDK.p  pIn the SDK examples, a simple sample has been given which uses an codeActivitycode to try and authorize the user using Single SignOn. Ive  tried this example myself, and it works. Im able to log in, I had to authorize the app to use my Facebook data and I could see the requests being made and received in LogCat.p  pNow, Ive tried adding the same code to my own app. This app is codeFragmentcode based using the Compatibility package. There is one central codeFragmentActivitycode and the rest of my classes are simple codeFragmentscode. When adding the sample code to one of these codeFragmentscode, the Facebook app starts up for half a second when trying to authorize, but afterwards closes and nothing has happened. Im back in my regular Fragment again.p  pWhen checking the LogCat after this, nothing suggests that the Facebook app even opened or made any requests other than the fact it shows some printing checks I added and the fact it says its starting the Facebook intent p  precode0112 131940.874 ISystem.out6087 Calling authorize 0112 131940.874 IActivityManager1380 Starting activity Intent  cmpcom.facebook.katana.ProxyAuth has extras  from pid 6087 0112 131940.874 ISystem.out6087 Called authorize codepre  pOther than that, nothing gets returned. No Facebookchecks, no statements saying my keys are wrong or anything, just nothing. The Facebook intent was called, but closed almost immediately and nothing else shows that it was even open.p  pThis has been boggling my mind for a few hours now, and Im starting to think the regular , sampleprovided approach just doesnt work in codeFragmentscode due to the way codeFragmentscode work.p  pThe code Ive been using is posted below. The Fragment gets fired by a button which calls a codeFragmentTransactioncode. Am I doing something fundamentally wrong here, or does the Facebook SDK really just not work with codeFragmentscode Ive tried searching for this problem but I havent been able to find anyone else with the same sort of situation.p  hr  precodepublic class FanWallFacebook extends Fragment       Facebook facebook  new Facebook294678133912628      public FanWallFacebook            Override     public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,             Bundle savedInstanceState           Inflate the layout for this fragment         return inflater.inflateR.layout.filler, container, false           Override     public void onStart          super.onStart          System.out.printlnCalling authorize         facebook.authorizegetActivity, new DialogListener              Override             public void onCompleteBundle values                  System.out.printlnCompleted                           Override             public void onFacebookErrorFacebookError error                  System.out.printlnFacebook error error.getMessage                            Override             public void onErrorDialogError e                  System.out.printlnGeneral error e.getMessage                           Override             public void onCancel                  System.out.printlnCancelled                                System.out.printlnCalled authorize            Override     public void onActivityResultint requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data          super.onActivityResultrequestCode, resultCode, data          facebook.authorizeCallbackrequestCode, resultCode, data         System.out.printlnAuthorize callbackd        codepre  hr  pstrongEditstrongp  pJust tried using a codeFragmentActivitycode, and lo and behold, that does work.

Therefore strongI want to check a condition, within the codevalidateWritecode method on the SalesLine table, to find out if the codevalidateWritecode was called form my new formstrong.

Negative 102794 pI have a Spring Web MVC application where i need to use an external device driver which returns information in an asynchronous manner every time the device gathers some new data. We need to pass an object at the begging to the start read method. This object implements an API defined interface which declares the callback method.p  pThe problem raises when this callback method needs to manipulate some bean in Springs session scope. Because the callback gets called in the Thread of the driver when the callback implementation wants to access a Spring bean it yields an exception saying that the current thread is not in Springs managed scope.p  pIm wondering if theres any way to make the object which is implementing the callback interface into some kind of proxy which knows information about the context of the session which constructed it so this way it can invoke bean methods through Springs context objectp

Negative 102794 pThere are other SO questions on speeding up jQuery Mobile for Android, but does anyone know how to accelerate page transitions on iPhones, specifically dialog transitionsp  pWere on JQM 1.0. JQM 1.1 is supposed to speed up page transitions though we havent seen any demos yet, but were wondering if anyone has done anything for JQM 1.0.p  pRight now, there is a two second delay, which is too much to show a dialog. We resort to one of two options. Using no animation for the page transition, which provides instant feedback, or rolling our own by binding to touchstart and animating the dialog, which is really just a big DIV inside the current page.p  pNeither is ideal.p  pSuggestionsp

Negative 102794 pI recently started using Java AsynchronousFileChannel for a project of mine, where i want to write to files as quick as possible. When i came to test my project, i realised that maybe read and write operations where not really asynchronous for me I made a very simple test program to see if write and read methods are blocking or not, by writing bytes to 2 files, one for each of my disks. p  precodeByteBuffer buffercByteBuffer.allocate7500000075MB ByteBuffer bufferdByteBuffer.allocate75000000 for int i0 ilt75000000 i    bufferc.putbyte1   bufferd.putbyte1   bufferc.flip bufferd.flip  ExecutorService executor  Executors.newFixedThreadPool10 AsynchronousFileChannel channelc AsynchronousFileChannel.openPaths.getCppp, getReadWriteOptions,executor, new FileAttributeltgt[0] AsynchronousFileChannel channeld AsynchronousFileChannel.openPaths.getDppp, getReadWriteOptions, executor, new FileAttributeltgt[0]  long  start  System.currentTimeMillis    System.out.printlnstart Future futurecchannelc.writebufferc, 0 System.out.printlnfuturec.isDone Future futuredchanneld.writebufferd, 0 System.out.printlnfutured.isDone long elapsedTimec  System.currentTimeMillis start   channelc.close channeld.close System.out.printlntimeelapsedTimec codepre  pSo, im writing two buffers, into two different files. Because each buffer is about 75 MB, i suppose that each buffer cannot be written immediatly to my disk, so i would expect as my output something  likep  precodefalse false time  codepre  pwhich would mean for me that the write operations are given to the executorService, and the program continues to run. In multiple runs of this program, this does happen for me, but NOT always. I mean, i get output likep  precodestart true true time2621 codepre  porp  precodestart false true time3039 codepre  por if im lucky    p  precodestart false false time235 codepre  pThe times really differ, and i dont even understand why i do get the first two outputs Id like someone to explain me factors that affect this output, andor how i am going to get only the 3rd of the above outputsp

Negative 102794 pI am developing my first website and I have built an interactive photo gallery. The main idea behind is that there is one large image displayed, if a user clicks this it changes to the next image. There is a also a thumbnail carousel below and this can be used to change to main image as well. I pretty much have this working as I would like minus a few minor points with style etc. I then tried using the site on my iPhone and found that the photo gallery did not work as it had done on my desktop. What seems to happen is that when I click an image it reloads the page with the same image, not the next one in the list. p  pThe way I have decided to code is that, the images are contained in anchor tags like p  precodelta classnextphoto href onclickreturn falsegt codepre  pWhen clicked jQuery catches the event and passes the appropriate parameters to the javascript function that updates the document with the new photo. This function called emchangePhotoem and creates an XMLHttpRequest to get the XML file that stores all the image names and alt information. p  pTo view the photo gallery in its current state go to a hrefhttpwww.mwlets.co.ukproperties.html relnofollowhttpwww.mwlets.co.ukproperties.htmlap  pI initially thought this would be a problem with iPhone not supporting javascript, jQuery or xml, but I seem to be able to find working examples of all of these things. I even tried the w3schools example of pulling information from an xml file and that worked fine.p  pMy javascript code isp  precode    document.readyfunction       a.nextphoto.bindclick,function                    var imgID  document.getElementByIdmainphoto.name           imgID           changePhotoimgID,false            document.readyfunction       a.prevphoto.bindclick,function                    var imgID  document.getElementByIdmainphoto.name           imgID           changePhotoimgID,false            document.readyfunction       a.thumbnail.bindclick,function                    var currentID  document.getElementByIdmainphoto.name           var thumbID  this.attrname           ifcurrentID  thumbID                            changePhotothumbID,false                         function changePhotonewimgID,slideshow            var imgsrc  httpwww.mwlets.co.ukImagesMayfieldLargetoletmayfieldashbournederbyshire     var xmlhttp, images, imageName, imageAlt, imgalt   if window.XMLHttpRequest    code for IE7, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari    xmlhttpnew XMLHttpRequest     else    code for IE6, IE5    xmlhttpnew ActiveXObjectMicrosoft.XMLHTTP      xmlhttp.onreadystatechangefunction       if xmlhttp.readyState4 ampamp xmlhttp.status200            images  xmlhttp.responseXML.documentElement.getElementsByTagNameIMAGE          ifnewimgID gt images.length                               newimgID  1                    ifnewimgID lt 1                        newimgID  images.length                   document.getElementByIdmainphoto.namenewimgID       document.getElementByIdphotoindex.innerHTMLnewimgID        imageNameimages[newimgID  1].getElementsByTagNameNAME       imgsrc  imageName[0].firstChild.nodeValue       document.getElementByIdmainphoto.srcimgsrc        imageAltimages[newimgID  1].getElementsByTagNameALT       imgalt  imageAlt[0].firstChild.nodeValue       document.getElementByIdmainphoto.altimgalt       document.getElementByIdcaptiontext.innerHTMLimgalt              xmlhttp.openGET,httpmwlets.co.ukImagesMayfieldimagelist.xml,true  xmlhttp.send   codepre  pIndividually I believe all the components should theoretically work on an iPhone.

It is my first attempt at Javascript, jQuery and Ajax in a proper application. Im open to suggestions for alternative ways to do this. My main requirements are that it sort of does what its doing on the site as viewed from a desktop at the moment, it is crossbrowerplatform and is quick to retrieve the images. I am planning to gracefully degrade this code so that browsers without JS can view the images as a kind of frame style gallery. p  pThanks in advance, p  pMatt p

Negative 102794 pI have noticed that when I run a report that contains nothing but an execution time field, the report spends a long time loading whenever I have a large embedded dataset from sql.

Is there a better way to create datasets SQL Report Builder seems pretty unusable as is, since some of my datasets contain millions of records.p

Negative 102794 pI am trying to understand exactly how to setup a bucket that is generally private but allows anonymous uploads with restrictions. The specific criteria arep  ul liThe bucket is mostly private and requires my keysecret to addremoveupdatelist files.li liThere is a directory i.e. key prefix called incoming that will allow anonymous users to upload content to but not list.li liThe bucket has a one day expiration on all content. As a bonus I would like the incoming directory to have a 30 minute expiration although if that is not possible a one day expiration for the whole bucket will do.li liFiles with the incoming prefix would be limited in size per object.li liI might want to also limit objects with the incoming prefix to only certain content types.li ul  pQuestions I have arep  ol liWould it be better to simply create two buckets. One for my incoming files and one for my own personal processing and storageli liWhat would the code look like that for a file to be uploaded into the incoming directory. Ideally I would like to avoid a dependency on a S3 library and just use HTTP calls. Bonus points if you can show me the right direction on this in Ruby. li ol  pThe expiration seems settable via the S3 Management Console but is only limited to 1 day as the smallest expiration. Can I put a decimal in that field Permissions seem to apply to an entire bucket instead of just a prefix. This is making me think I just need two buckets. If I keep with one bucket I think I need to create an IAM policy and apply that to the bucket but it is beyond my limited knowledge of S3 and I want to ensure I dont leave a hole in the permissions that allow people to do more than I want them to.p  pI have found lots of documentation on doing anonymous uploads to S3 via a HTTP form post. I could adapt that into code but I am wondering since I am in application code and not a HTTP form post is there an easier wayp

Negative 102794 pI have a multithreaded c program written with pthreads.  I want to know if what I am doing is right.  Currently the program seems to run when there are no optimizations.  But when I use optimizations, it fails. I am trying to figure out why.p  pI want to know if the basic multi threading synchronization that I am using is correct.  Here is a short version which contains only the relevant parts.  Please let me know if this is the correct way to multithread.p  pThe way it works Each worker has a number of jobs to do.  The worker threads are initiated first.  Then they wait until a job has been assigned to them by the main thread.  They complete the job, intimate the main thread and go back to waiting again.  p  pThe main thread assigns a job to N workers and signals them to start.  Then it waits for their completion and resumes normal work.p  pEach worker thread has a context variable named workerCtx.  This stores all the relevant info needed by the worker and also the mutexs and the cond variables.p  pThe main thread has a mutex and a cond variable too.p  pAlso the parent has variable called the threadCompletionCount.  Initially this variable is 0 before assigning the work.  Once each worker thread is done, it will increment this variable by one under the protection of a mutex and signal the parent thread.  The parent thread will know that all the workers have completed when this variable is equal to the number of workers.p  pHere is a short version of the workerCtxp  precodetypedef enum INITIALIZE  0 , WAIT  1, WORK1  2, WORK2 3, DIE  4 worktypet  typedef struct workerCtxt      int id      pthreadmutext mutex     pthreadcondt cond      pthreadmutext  parentMutex     pthreadcondt  parentCond     int  parentThreadCompletionCount      worktypet workType      Other application specific variables follow. workerCtxt codepre  pHere mutex and cond refer to the local mutex and cond variables specific to this thread.

Negative 102794 pI need help with the performance of the following code. It does a memcpy on two dynamically allocated arrays of arbitrary sizep  precodeint main    double a, b   unsigned n  10000000, i   a  mallocnsizeofdouble   b  mallocnsizeofdouble   fori0 iltn i      a[i]  1.0      b[i]  0.0        tic   bzerob, nsizeofdouble   tocbzero1    tic   bzerob, nsizeofdouble   tocbzero2    tic   memcpyb, a, nsizeofdouble   tocmemcpy  codepre  ptictoc measure the execution time.p  pOn my computer it takes 0.035s to memcpy Linux, gcc version 4.4.6. If I now uncomment the line which initializes the destination array b, the code is three times faster   0.011s. p  pI have observed similar behavior when using a loop instead of memcpy. Usually I do not care about this since it is enough to initialize the memory before using it. However, I now need to perform a simple memory copy, and do it as fast as possible. Initializing the data requires writing e.g. 0 to the memory, which is not necessary and takes time. And I would like to perform a memory copy with all available memory bandwidth.p  pIs there a solution to this problem Or is it connected to the way Linux handles dynamic memory some sort of lazy page allocation and can not be worked around How is it on other systemsp  pbEditb The same results are obtained with gcc 4.6. I used O3 to compile.p  pbEditb  Thank you all for your comments. I do understand that memory mapping takes time. I guess I just have a hard time accepting that it takes so long, much longer than the actual memory access. The code has been modified to include a benchmark of the initialization of array b using two subsequent bzero calls. The timings now showp  pbzero1                                 0.273981br bzero2                                 0.056803br memcpy                                 0.117934brp  pClearly, the first bzero call does bmuchb more than just stream zeros to memory  that is memory mapping and memory zeroing. The second bzero call on the other hand takes half of the time required to do a memcpy, which is exactly as expected  write only time vs. read and write time. I understand that the overhead of the second bzero call must be there due to OS security reasons. What about the rest Can I not decrease it somehow, e.g. use larger memory pages Different kernel settingsp  pI should mention that I run this on Ubuntu wheeze.p

Negative 102794 pI am getting intermittent Connection Timed Out errors when a php script on my web server connects to the MySQL database server over the private network. However, if I tell the script to use the public network to connect, these errors do not appear.p  pMy connection script is setup so that whenever I try to connect to mysql, it checks for errors, if there is an error, it sends me an email then automatically switches to the public network to try that connection.

Further when I stopped the service I got a NullPointerException since in the onDestroy method of the service I had used the thread object.p  pDoes the thread get killed and not run as long as the service runs Do I need to do this whiletrue operation in onStart of service class itself and not spawn a new threadp  pAny solution provided will be of great help.p  pCode is as followsp  precode    public void run                          Log.dTAG,Starting Thread                  String data              updateServer         whileflag                                         String path  extStorageDirectory    appFolder    SATpingLog  Long.toStringSystem.currentTimeMillis  .txt             createFilepath             int count  0             whileflag ampamp count lt 32768                                                             data                             String result  Long.toStringgetLatencyurl                                                      data  Long.toStringSystem.currentTimeMillis     gps[0]     gps[1]     strength     result                 Log.dDEBUGGING,data                 writeToLogpath,data                 try                                       Thread.sleepsleepTime                                   catch InterruptedException e                                        TODO Autogenerated catch block                     e.printStackTrace                                  count                          updateServer                         public long getLatencyString Url              long startTime  0, endTime  0, latency  0                            try                       HttpParams httpParameters  new BasicHttpParams              Set the timeout in milliseconds until a connection is established.

Negative 102794 pMajor question updatep  pGoal the ability to select a range of cells or rows. Update one cell and have that update cascade to all applicable cells e.g. cells in the same column p  pWould also like the Excel behavior of using Enter to commit and move to next cell without losing the selected range.p  pTried doing this with the Wpf Datagrid control.. and the result is a kludge..p  ul liThe datagrid supports multiselection using Ctrl  Shift.li liHowever on entering edit mode irrespective of SelectionMode and Unit, all other rows are deselected leaving the one being edited as the sole selection. Worked around this by hooking into MousePreview events and caching multiselection if any. Added an IsSelected property to my row ViewModels and used them to modify selected rows at will.li liEdits are committed only after the user tabs out. Used binding with UpdateSourceTrigger set to PropertyChanged. Applied current edit to cached multiselection using a ContainerVm which listened to PropertyChangeNotifications from the RowViewModels.li liDataGrid events were not helpful  by the time BeginningEdit is called, the selection was already modified by the MouseDown handler in DataGridCell.li ul  pSo Grid events and styling havent helped. Nor has the ViewModel approach. Another option to try out is to write a derivation of DataGridCell and plug it in somehow.p  pIdeas p

Negative 102794 pI have a a hrefhttpwww.powertac.org relnofollowlargish projecta that needs to be usable either with a commandline interface or through a webapp. The core server is deployed as 10 separate jars. The webapp is currently deployed as a .war, but that is a huge file that duplicates all the individual deployments and makes updating a module a big pain  you have to redeploy this huge .war file every time you update anything, and much of the time we dont use the webapp.p  pSo I am trying to deploy a skinny war, without the dependencies. However, theres no .ear file to carry them, so at runtime, I unpack the skinny war and use jettyrun, with the classesDirectory and webAppSourceDirectory pointing into the unpacked content. That all seems to work. The problem is that the dependencies from the webapp module do not make it into the classpath for jettyrun. When I use jettyrun in the webapp module, the classpath includes all parent, local, and transitive dependencies. But when I use jettyrun in the distribution project that depends on the webapp module, the only dependencies that get into the classpath are from the parent module, not from the webapp module. Note that the webapp module is the only local dependency in the distribution module.p  pWhat am I missingp

Negative 102794 pMy question in short  is whether I can modify the traversal logic used by Neo4j  how to have a control over which edges are traversed and which arent, during the reachbility computation.p  pFull descriptionp  pI am considering migrating from our current DB to neo4j, and I am wondering if neo4j is a good fit for the following taskp  pWe have large graphs with about 10M simple nodes  their attribute is only a single id.br We also have 3 kinds of edges  standard, opening and closing. The opening and closing ones also have a color attribute, so they are matched. Each opening edge has exactly one matching closing edge. For example, there is one opening edge colored as 3, so theres also one closing edge colored the same.p  pWe need to solve a reachability between two nodes where the rules of traversal are fairly simple You can go through standard edges as you want, you can go through opening edges as you want, while maintaining the order of visited opening edges in a stack BUT thats the tricky part when you come to a junction that has several closing edges, you MUST go through the closing edge which matches the last open edge encountered, and then pop out that open edge from the stack.p  pFor examplep  pa [STANDARD]B[Open color3]C[Standard]D[Close color3]E brand alsobr D[Close color4]Fp  pnote that D has two closing edges, with different colors.  By the rules defined above, E is reachable by A as the color stack has [3] on its top.br F, however, is not reachable by A.p  pCan neo4j be configured for such graph traversal logic Thanksp

Negative 102794 pI am attempting to use codeSetEventcode and codeWaitForMultipleObjectscode so I wrote a couple of functions that I wanted to synchronize using Events. I want the first function to execute, and then signal the second function to execute, which in turn signals the first function to execute again etc. p  pTwo events were created, one initialized to a signaled state, the other unsignaled. The only way I can get the execution to flow as expected is when putting the each thread to sleep for 10 ms.

However,    if you change any configuration or code from libraries loaded here, youll    need to restart spork for it take effect.  end  Spork.eachrun do    This code will be run each time you run your specs.  end    Instructions   Sort the contents of this file into a Spork.prefork and a Spork.eachrun  block.   The Spork.prefork block is run only once when the spork server is started.  You typically want to place most of your slow initializer code in here, in  particular, requireing any 3rdparty gems that you dont normally modify  during development.   The Spork.eachrun block is run each time you run your specs.  In case you  need to load files that tend to change during development, require them here.  With Rails, your application modules are loaded automatically, so sometimes  this block can remain empty.   Note You can modify files loaded from the Spork.eachrun block without  restarting the spork server.  However, this file itself will not be reloaded,  so if you change any of the code inside the eachrun block, you still need to  restart the server.  In general, if you have nontrivial code in this file,  its advisable to move it into a separate file so you can easily edit it  without restarting spork.  For example, with RSpec, you could move  nontrivial code into a file specsupportmyhelper.rb, making sure that the  specsupport files are required from inside the eachrun block.   Any code that is left outside the two blocks will be run during preforking  and during eachrun  thats probably not what you want.   These instructions should selfdestruct in 10 seconds.

Negative 102794 pI have created a client that talks to web services on various servers, and am trying to format the XML using XSL. The services were all created from the same specification, so the XML they emit has the same format and xmlns namespace names.

Negative 102794 pIf we want to define a case class that holds a single object, say a tuple, we can do it easilyp  precodesealed case class Ax Int, Int codepre  pIn this case, retrieving the x value will take a small constant amount of time, and this class will only take a small constant amount of space, regardless of how it was created.p  pNow, lets assume we want to hold a sequence of values instead we could it like thisp  precodesealed final case class Ax Seq[Int] codepre  pThis might seem to work as before, except that now storage and time to read all of x is proportional to x.length.p  pHowever, this is not actually the case, because someone could do something like thisp  precodeval hugeList  1 to 1000000000.toList val a  AhugeList.view.filter  500000000 codepre  pIn this case, the a object looks like an innocent case class holding a single int in a sequence, but in fact it requires gigabytes of memory, and it will take on the order of seconds to access that single element every time.p  pThis could be fixed by specifying something like List[T] as the type instead of Seq[T] however, this seems ugly since it adds a reference to a specific implementation, while in fact other well behaved implementations, like Vector[T], would also do.p  pAnother worrying issue is that one could pass a mutable Seq[T], so it seems that one should at least use immutable.Seq instead of scala.collection.Seq although the compiler cant actually enforce the immutability at the moment.p  pLooking at most libraries it seems that the common pattern is to use scala.collection.Seq[T], but is this really a good ideap  pOr perhaps Seq is being used just because its the shortest to type, and in fact it would be best to use immutable.Seq[T], List[T], Vector[T] or something elsep  h2New text added in edith2  pLooking at the class library, some of the most core functionality like scala.reflect.api.Trees does in fact use List[T], and in general using a concrete class seems a good idea.p  pBut then, why use List and not Vectorp  pVector has O1Ologn length, prepend, append and random access, is asymptotically smaller List is 34 times bigger due to vtable and next pointers, and supports cache efficient and parallelized computation, while List has none of those properties except O1 prepend.p  pSo, personally Im leaning towards Vector[T] being the correct choice for something exposed in a library data structure, where one doesnt know what operations the library user will need, despite the fact that it seems less popular.p

Negative 102794 pI have a class in a Java project which contains a 2D array of values and provides useful methods for interacting with it. It uses Location objects which just store two values to access points in the mapping and return the value. It has a method isValid, which checks whether the Location object is within the mapping of the grid.p  precodepublic boolean isValidLocation loc      try           will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if not valid          occs is the 2D array within the class         occs[loc.getX][loc.getY]         return true          catch ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e          return false       codepre  pNow, I know I could just use comparisons to check values and see if that loc fits within the grid, but this is faster as it does not need to run comparisons and the cases of non valid Locations being checked are far in the minority.  However, here is my problem since the value returned by the line accessing the array is not being assigned or sent into a method, I get an error about AssignmentOperators. I know it would be an easy fix to either assign it to a temp value or run it through some useless method, but both of those seem like derpy bandaid solutions to me, and I was wondering if there was a cleaner way to do that. Besides, the former elicits a warning from Eclipse. p  pAnyway, this is low priority, but its bugging me that something so simple is not possible in such an easy implementation to be perfectly honest.

Negative 102794 pIve been planning out a Rails RSS aggregator lately, and I ran into something I could use some advice on. The part that would handle the polling and parsing of users subscribed feeds needs to be running constantly, which I assume a daemon is probably the best option for. I would use the Daemons gem and have the daemon periodically query the database for feeds in need of refreshing, then use Feedzirra to parse and save items.p  pMy question is how would the daemon share the models and migrations from Rails, especially if the daemon were running on another server, should the app require it for scalability i.e. database server, feed crawler server, and instances of the frontend Im probably falling victim of premature scaling, but as a Ruby newbie Im interested in what the best way to handle this would be. For the sake of doing it the right way the first time.p  pOr am I going about this the wrong wayp
Negative 102794 pI know how and what eager loading is, and Ive searched around Google and StackOverflow for other eager loading questions.

I just want to try and speed up generation of these reports which involves loading all the Organizations, something likep  precodeOrganizations.includesuserslogged.joinsactivities codepre  pNow, I realize here that the codeincludesusersloggedcode will load all the activities but the codejoinsactivitiescode is still necessary for the fields that are orderedgrouped by which Ive excluded as they are not important to the question.p  pThe question now is, I would like to eager load all the Activities for all users that have been selected by the codeincludesusersloggedcode directive as I will not only need the Organization details, its associated activities, and all users that have logged activities for the organization. In addition to that I need to load all the activities for the user ideally associated with the organization but I can work that out once I figure out how to eager load.p  pMy current implementationp  precodeorgs  Organization.includesuserslogged.joinsactivities.all orgs.each do org   org.userslogged.each do user      Just work with user.activities   end end codepre  pThis results in a query per user that averages code0.3 mscode with the current amount of test data which adds up rather quickly. Is there a way to eager load all activities for a collection of usersp

My first instinct is to attempt to add a copy of the Items to Build field in the build process parameters that will be used explicitly for VS2010 solutions, and then attempt to define an activity to invoke the 2010 compiler against those projects. p  pDoes this sound sane Is there a better wayp

The getter basically queries all controls on the panel of the form and adds them to a hashtable because I am doing some timer based stuff with them. But during design time it is not necessary for the designer to access this property. Any suggestions how i really can hide it from the designer and prevent this errorp  pIf i missed to give any other important input please let me know.p  pEDITp  pI am still trying to find out what causes the problem. One thing i found out is that when i disable the Optimize Code Gerneration setting in visual studio designer settings the error occurs all the time. When i reenable it there error occures once on the first attempt to save the form  and does not on the second attempt  meaning that the form is saved. I am not sure right now if it does all the time  but at least for the couple of times i tried it did.p  pAll the public properties working with enumerations or other collection objects are implemented to return null if in DesignMode now. The exception still occurs as the designer tries to access the getter functions.p  pKind regards.p

Negative 102794 pI have been trying to find a solution to this for about 36 hours now so hopefully Im not duplicating a question or asking something obvious. I am building a web app that has to manipulate files that I store in S3 and put back the new versions in S3 with a publicread acl. Then a different page allows you to view the updated file. The app exists on an amazon EC2 server and connects to an amazon S3 bucket.p  pI am using django, celery, and boto to do this. I have a celery task set up that gets some info from one of my views and does the processing and then posts the new file to S3. I am able to get the original file from S3, manipulate it successfully, and repost it to S3. The only thing that doesnt seem to work is changing the permissions on that file. So everything works except when you go to the viewing page, I get a 403 Forbidden error when trying to access that file.p  pIf I go into S3 myself and change the permission on that file for everyone to read, it all works. Before I go on, the code that I use in my task that almost works isp  precodename  filename.blah conn  boto.connects3 b  conn.getbucketsettings.AWSSTORAGEBUCKETNAME grabfromS3name,b  grab file from S3 outname  convname sendtoS3outname,b codepre  pwhere the functions in there arep  precodedef grabfromS3file,bucket     k  Keybucket     k.key  file     k.getcontentstofilenamefile  def sendtoS3file,bucket     k  Keybucket     k.key  file     k.setcontentsfromfilenamefile     k.setaclpublicread codepre  pand convname just does some conversion stuff. So this works almost all the way except the files permissions are not publicread. All the AWS credentials and bucket name I assume are being imported from the environment properly because it is able to push and pull files to and from S3. p  pThe big confusing part is that when I open up a python environment from either the venv on my EC2 server or just the python that was installed on it to begin with and I run all the commands I show above, it DOES work. I can change the permission with no problems. And when the task runs it does not throw any errors in the celery logs so I dont think the task is actually running into errors. Its just simply not changing what its supposed to change.p  pThings that I have triedp  ol liI tried to use other versions of the permissions function such as codek.setcontentsfromfilenamefile,policypublicreadcode or codek.makepubliccode or codeb.setaclpublicread,outnamecode but none of those worked either.li liI changed the permissions on the bucket to say that everyone was allowed to change the permissions and it didnt work still.li lipI tried to change the bucket policy to this below and it made no effectp  pcode     Version 20081017,     Id whatever,     Statement [           Sid whatever,      Effect Allow,      Principal                    AWS           ,     Action [     s3PutObjectAcl,     s3PutObject],     Resource [     arnawss3bucketname,     arnawss3bucketname     ]          ]  codepli ol  pIn the end, Im really confused because I can seem to do all of this just fine from a python environment on the same EC2 instance but not the code running on that instance. Ive searched and searched and havent been able to find any suggestions that worked. Another possibly useful piece of info but it might be irrelevant depending on the problem is that if I try to connect to S3 in my view by doing similar commands above it returns an errorp  pNo handler was ready to authenticate. 1 handlers were checked. [HmacAuthV1Handler] Check your credentialsp  peven though it works when those commands are run in my task I would assume it was the wrong access key or secret access key or something, but it works with everything else. I think Im doing the correct imports in the python code of the parts of the boto library I need.p  pI just recently set this instance up so it has probably almost the newest version of boto, celery, django, etc on it. I probably forgot something. Please let me know if you need more info to answer the question. Im really not sure what is going on.p  pThanks a ton in advance.p

Negative 102794 pI know this at least IMO is a stupid request.  Because WSDL is old hat and sucks compared to just doing a RESTful API.  But I have a corporate mandate where we want to do a REST API but then corporate wants a WSDL still.  I know..it makes no sense and apparently we cant push back and say NO and tell them to just use our future REST API.p  pSo strongcan you generate a WSDL if I were to start creating a REST API with ServiceStackstrong  Meaning I add uri attributes and such So that I can make them happyp  pI prefer not to use WCF, its a nightmare with a ton of attributes and configuration to try and hack a RPC style web service to try and be RESTful.  Obviously that doesnt work out too well.p

Negative 102794 pBasically I have an Ajax request instantiated by a button where it is passed to my controller, and then that controller returns a list of objects. I initially was thinking whether this could be done by loading the returned ajax object into the JSTL forEach loop, but I think that cannot be done after some research.

Negative 102794 pI have a need to develop a specialized CLR profiler. CLR profilers must be implemented as a COM server implementing ICorProfilerCallback or a newer version currently up through 5. Profiler initialization occurs in a callback method InitializeIUnknown pICorProfilerInfoUnk. This gives one an opportunity to do a QueryInterface on the provided IUnknown object and obtain pointers to the ICorProfilerInfo interfaces. As of .NET 4.5, there are ICorProfilerInfo, ICorProfilerInfo2, ICorProfilerInfo3, and ICorProfilerInfo4, with each new version providing additional functionality. Ideally I would like to obtain a pointer to the latest available version and let the vtables figure out what the real object is.p  precodeif FAILEDpICorProfilerInfoUnkgtQueryInterfaceIIDICorProfilerInfo4, LPVOIDampmpICorProfilerInfo      if FAILEDpICorProfilerInfoUnkgtQueryInterfaceIIDICorProfilerInfo3, LPVOIDampmpICorProfilerInfo              if FAILEDpICorProfilerInfoUnkgtQueryInterfaceIIDICorProfilerInfo2, LPVOIDampmpICorProfilerInfo                      if FAILEDpICorProfilerInfoUnkgtQueryInterfaceIIDICorProfilerInfo, LPVOIDampmpICorProfilerInfo                              AtlTraceTEXT[Initialize] Failed to retrieve any ICorProfilerInfo interface.                 return SFALSE                             codepre  pNotice that all cases, the pointer to the returned interface is the same variable mpICorProfilerInfo, which is of type CComQIPtr. I then call methods on it oblivious of the actual type of the object implementing the method.p  pThis leads me to two questionsp  ol liIn COM  ATL context, is it safe to retrieve derived interfaces, store them in a parent interface such as above, and then call functions from itli liA parent interface obviously has no knowledge of functions in derived interfaces. How can I check if the pointer IS A derived interface such as ICorProfilerInfo2 and cast it to suchli ol  pIn testing so far, 1 generally seems okay. But I would would prefer confirmation or advise. I am much more uncertain about point 2. For example, ICorProfilerInfo has a SetEnterLeaveFunctionHooks function while ICorProfilerInfo2 has a SetEnterLeaveFunctionHooks2 function. I would like to do something like the following pseudo codep  precodeif mpICorProfilerInfo IS ICorProfilerInfo2      ICorProfilerInfo2 mpICorProfilerInfogtSetEnterLeaveFunctionHooks2...  else      mpICorProfilerInfogtSetEnterLeaveFunctionHooks...  codepre  pAny advice on how can this be accomplished would be most appreciated.p

Negative 102794 psome time ago I started to write some code in JavaScript to learn it a little bit. I picked a rollinrollout animation as project. I know about JQuerys slideDownslideUp, but I wanted to work with pure JavaScript.p  pI finished my effect, and the result looks pretty good in all major browsers except Firefox tested versions 22.x to the latest 25.0.1. In Firefox, the rolling in and out stutters while it rolls smoothly in Chrome, Opera, and Internet Explorer.p  pThe general approach is unsurprisingly to have an elements style.height or width attribute increaseddecreased several times by some pixels over a given time. To avoid calculating sizes every time the effect takes place, I calculate them one time and place them in an array first item 0  stepSize, last item wanted heightwidth.

The step sizes in the array are rounded to integers, thats why the last step just sets 0  to handle rounding differences.p  pFor convenience, I wrote my own element helper, theres no JQuery involved here.p  pI tested Firefox without AddOns, no difference.p  pI highly appreciate any help you can provide p

Negative 102794 pI have been having a troublesome issue working with NetBeans I have a program which uses big amounts of images, text files and sounds. I place them all on a resources folder inside the build folder. I have read that is the right way, since NetBeans uses this folder as root for the project. The BIG problem comes when I press by mistake clean and build, or rename the project, since both actions ERASE THE WHOLE build directory. When this happens, I lose all of my data, and have to start over editing images, etc. Please notice that I make backups, but I still have to start over since last backup the image files are changed very frequently, so this is not a definitive solution. Since this is a longterm Java project, it has happened several times, and it is very frustrating. p  pIs there a way to place my resources on a directory OUTSIDE of my project folder In case there is not, can I somehow configure NetBeans so it places the deleted files somewhere like trash bin or somewhere elsep  pIf it helps, Im working under OSX system, but I think the same would apply for other operating systems.p  pI have seen similar questions have been posted, but not solved.

Negative 102794 pIm trying to create a logging service for all SOAP method calls to my ASP.NET webservice. Ive been looking at  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17620228logsoapmessagesfromaconsoleapplicationLog SOAP messages from a console applicationa and the walkthrough for SOAP extensions at MSDN a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarys25h0swd28vvs.10029.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarys25h0swd28vvs.10029.aspxa but they dont seem to cover it completely.p  pI dont want to alter the SOAP message, just log it to a database table. What Im trying to do is read the SOAP message stream, parse it as an XML, log the XML and the let the call be on its merry way. But when I read the stream it is spentdisposed. Ive tried copying the stream contents to not interrupt the flow.p  pAccording to the walkthrough the codeProcessMessagecode method should look something like thisp  precodepublic override void ProcessMessageSoapMessage message      switch message.Stage         case SoapMessageStage.BeforeSerialize        break    case SoapMessageStage.AfterSerialize         Write the SOAP message out to a file.

WriteInput message         break    case SoapMessageStage.AfterDeserialize        break    default        throw new Exceptioninvalid stage      codepre  pIve managed to parse the stream without problems during the codeBeforeDeserializecode stage, but then codeProcessMessagecode is called again in the codeAfterSerializecode stage and by then the stream is used and no longer contains any data.p  pAccording to SOAP Message Modification Using SOAP Extensions a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryesw638yk28vvs.10029.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryesw638yk28vvs.10029.aspxa the SOAP call goes through the following stepsp  blockquote   h2Server Side Receives a Request Message and Prepares a Responseh2      ol   liASP.NET on the Web server receives the SOAP message.li   liA new instance of the SOAP extension is created on the Web server.li   liOn the Web server, if this is the first time this SOAP extension has executed with this Web service on the server side, the GetInitializer method is invoked on the SOAP extension running on the server.li   liThe Initialize method is invoked.li   liThe ChainStream method is invoked.li   liThe ProcessMessage method is invoked with SoapMessageStage set to strongBeforeDeserializestrong.li   liASP.NET deserializes the arguments within the XML.li   liThe ProcessMessage method is invoked with SoapMessageStage set to strongAfterDeserializestrong.li   liASP.NET creates a new instance of the class implementing the Web service and invokes the Web service method, passing in the deserialized arguments.

Then it shouldnt do anything more until after the server has processed the call, done what it needs step 10, and returned a response step 13. Instead it immediately calls codeProcessMessagecode again in the codeAfterSerializecode stage, but this time the stream is already spent and throws an exception when I try to log it.p  pAccording to the walkthrough I should use the codeChainStreamcode method, and it should be run in step 5 above. When I make the call it is run emtwiceem, once before codeBeforeDeserializecode and once before codeAfterSerializecode.p  pIve tried copying the message stream to a separate stream and use that for the logging, also to set some kind of status if codeBeforeDeserializecode already have run, but problem still persists.p  pI still need the code in codeAfterSerializecode to handle the response that is sent back to the client. But if I try to remove my code in codeAfterSerializecode and only run the code in codeBeforeDeserialize I get acodeHTTP 400 Bad Request.p  pThis all happens before the actual method call, so I never even get to the code inside the method step 10.p

Negative 102794 pI have a piece of code that does something like this p  precodeselector1.hide300 ... ... ... if selector2visible.length0    selector3.show  codepre  pHere, codeselector1code is a subset of codeselector2code. The problem I have is that the last part of the code that is attempting to make codeselector3code visible does not get past the codeifcode as codeselector2visible.lengthcode is not zero. This is because codeselector1code is still being animated. If I wait for 300ms for the animation to be completed, The code shall work fine. And I cannot use the completion callback functions  my code is too complicated for that. How do I get the codeselector3.showcode to work under these circumstancesp  pMy workaround was to use  p  precodeif selector2visible.lengthselector2animated.length0    selector3.show  codepre  pBut this seems like a code that is likely to break. I believe that, if I can make sure that the elements being animated are eventually going to be invisible, I can safely trigger codeselector3.showcode. Is there a way to know the final states of a currently running animating elementp
Negative 102794 pIm in need of making a rectangle clickable, at which it will run a function that animates it and does some stuff. Ive tried to browse Microsofts API, but I dont find anything and Im going crazy because of this. This will be the last time I touch XAML, but I really need to know how to get this to work.p  precodeltGrid BackgroundTransparentgt     ltGrid same samegt         ltRectangle MouseLeftButtonDownmoveClick xNamered                  FillRed Height125 Width125 StrokePink              StrokeThickness10 Margin106,196,225,348              gt     ltGridgt ltGridgt codepre  pThis is one of my rectangles and I have a function called moveClick in the .xaml.cs file that should be called. In that function there is some code firing up an animation that will target this rectangles. Since I have a lot of rectangles I want to animate I am changing the target depending on which one is pressed. Problem is, the MouseEvent isnt happening. I have googled for hours but Microsofts help is useless. I dont know what to do.p  pI cant really post more code than this because then Id have to rewrite it all over due to my PC Im programming on has no internet connection. THis is my laptop and Im going through my phone because my normal internet is down. My desktop has no wifi.p  pSO, can anybody who has had experience with Windows apps tell me what the reason could be Is it because Im in a grid I saw somewhere that it has to have a transparent background. It is. Im so clueless because theres nothing to go on because wherever I look, I find something irrelevant or dead ends.p  pEDIT Just to clarify, the animation works. I temporarily set it to run by pressing a button used for something else. And it works. It just doesnt work when touching the Rectangles.p  pEDIT TWO Im just using the template, and just added stuff under the ContentPanel as they call it.p

Negative 102794 pIm using MapBox and RMTileCaches beginBackgroundCacheForTileSource to preload tiles before rendering maps in my client app. I want to preload the tiles for the currently visible area of the map from zoom level 3 thru zoom level 7. So, I pass the current bounds of my mapView using the rect returned from [mapView latitudeLongitudeBoundingBox]. My ViewController implements RMTileCacheBackgroundDelegate so as to get callbacks as the caching occurs and then completes. I do receive callbacks on didBeginBackgroundCacheWithCountforTileSource and didBackgroundCacheTilewithIndexofTotalTileCount However, tileCacheDidFinishBackgroundCache is never called.p  pI stepped thru the source of RMTileCache and noticed that the actual count of cached tiles in progTile never reaches the calculated total count in totalTiles. Therefore, the final callback, tileCacheDidFinishBackgroundCache, is not reached.p  pIm not sure how to change or if I should change the totalTiles calculation. Perhaps I am passing the wrong viewing rect in my initial call Im not totally clear if that is correct. I can create a simple fix that calls tileCacheDidFinishBackgroundCache in the case that caching simply finishes, but this seems to just hide the issue. Any guidance here would be appreciated.p  pFor reference, my test code is straight forwardp  precodeimport ViewController.h  interface ViewController   end  implementation ViewController   voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      RMMapboxSource onlineSource  [[RMMapboxSource alloc] initWithMapIDappleweed.controlroom]     mapView  [[RMMapView alloc] initWithFrameself.view.bounds andTilesourceonlineSource]     mapView.delegate  self     mapView.bouncingEnabled  YES     mapView.clusteringEnabled  YES     mapView.clusterMarkerSize  CGSizeMake40, 40     mapView.clusterAreaSize  CGSizeMake40, 40     mapView.zoom  1      RMSphericalTrapezium rect  [mapView latitudeLongitudeBoundingBox]     mapView.tileCache.backgroundCacheDelegate  self     [mapView.tileCache beginBackgroundCacheForTileSourcemapView.tileSource     southWestrect.southWest     northEastrect.northEast     minZoom3.0     maxZoom7.0]     voidtileCacheRMTileCache tileCache didBeginBackgroundCacheWithCountinttileCount forTileSourceid ltRMTileSourcegttileSource       NSLogstart     voidtileCacheRMTileCache tileCache didBackgroundCacheTileRMTiletile withIndexinttileIndex ofTotalTileCountinttotalTileCount       float percentComplete  floattileIndex  floattotalTileCount  100     NSString update  [NSString stringWithFormat.0f, percentComplete]     NSLog,update     voidtileCacheDidFinishBackgroundCacheRMTileCache tileCache       NSLogDONE     voidtileCacheDidCancelBackgroundCacheRMTileCache tileCache       NSLogCanceled     voiddidReceiveMemoryWarning      [super didReceiveMemoryWarning]      Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.   end codepre

Negative 102794 pWhen implementing a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFordE28093Fulkersonalgorithm relnofollowFordFulkersona or a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDinic27salgorithm relnofollowDinitza algorithms for maximum network flow there are two operations that need to be performed on the graphp  ul liIterate over all neighbours of a given vertexli liFind the reverse edge of a given edgethis is needed for the graph modification when a flow is added along an augmenting path.li ul  pIdeally the first operation will be linear with respect to the number of neighbours and the second one should be constant. In addition the memory required for the graph representation should be linear with respect to the number of edgesnote that for most practical applications of max network flow algorithms I have seen the number of edges is about linear times the number of vertices. All the estimations for the complexity for the two algorithms will only hold if the constraints above are met. p  pThe problem is that none of the classical graph representations is able to meet the above requirementsp  h2Adjacency Matrixh2  pUsing adjacency matrix, finding the reverse edge of a given edge can be done in constant time. However iterating over all neighbours is linear with respect to the number of strongall verticesstrong and also the required memory is quadratic with respect to the number of vertices.p  h2Edges listh2  pUsing this representation, iterating over all neighbours will not be linear with respect to the number of neighbours and also finding the reverse edge for a given edge is not constant.p  h2Neighbours listh2  pUsing this representation we can iterate over all neighbours in linear time and also the needed memory is linear with respect to the number of edges. Still, finding the reverse edge for a given edge will be linear with respect to the number of neighbours of the destination vertex. p  pWith a slight modification of this representation we could improve that  if instead of neighbours list we keep some binary search tree of the neighbours we could find the reverse edge with logarithmic complexity. And even better  if we use hash map instead of binary search tree we will have constant amortized complexity. Still this representation does not feel right  although still linear, a hash map has some memory overhead. Also it only has amortized constant complexity thus some operations may in fact be slower. p  h2The questionh2  pSo my question is what graph representation is appropriate to implement maximum network flow algorithms p

Negative 102794 pFor fun, and to learn functional programming, Im developing a program in Clojure that does algorithmic composition using ideas from this theory of music called Westergaardian Theory. It generates lines of music where a line is just a single staff consisting of a sequence of notes, each with pitches and durations. It basically works like thisp  ol liStart with a line consisting of three notes the specifics of how these are chosen are not important.li liRandomly perform one of several operations on this line. The operation picks randomly from all pairs of adjacent notes that meet a certain criteria for each pair, the criteria only depends on the pair and is independent of the other notes in the line. It inserts 1 or several notes depending on the operation between the chosen pair. Each operation has its own unique criteria.li liContinue randomly performing these operations on the line until the line is the desired length. li ol  pThe issue Ive run into is that my implementation of this is quite slow, and I suspect it could be made faster. Im new to Clojure and functional programming in general though Im experienced with OO, so Im hoping someone with more experience can point out if Im not thinking in a functional paradigm or missing out on some FP technique.p  pMy current implementation is that each line is a vector containing maps. Each map has a note and a dur. notes value is a keyword representing a musical note like A4 or C3. durs value is a fraction, representing the duration of the note 1 is a whole note, 14 is a quarter note, etc.... So, for example, a line representing the C major scale starting on C3 would look like thisp  precode[ note C3 dur 1 note D3 dur 1 note E3 dur 1 note F3 dur 1 note G3 dur 1 note A4 dur 1 note B4 dur 1 ] codepre  pThis is a problematic representation because theres not really a quick way to insert into an arbitrary index of a vector. But insertion is the most frequently performed operation on these lines. My current terrible function for inserting notes into a line basically splits the vector using subvec at the point of insertion, uses conj to join the first part  notes  last part, then uses flatten and vec to make them all be in a onedimensional vector. For example if I want to insert C3 and D3 into the the C major scale at index 3 where the F3 is, it would do this Ill use the note name in place of the note and dur mapsp  ol liconj [C3 D3 E3] [C3 D3] [F3 G3 A4 B4], which creates [C3 D3 E3 [C3 D3] [F3 G3 A4 B4]]li livec flatten previousvector which gives [C3 D3 E3 C3 D3 F3 G3 A4 B4]li ol  pThe run time of that is On, AFAIK. p  pIm looking for a way to make this insertion faster. Ive searched for information on Clojure data structures that have fast insertion but havent found anything that would work. I found finger trees but they only allow fast insertion at the start or end of the list.p  pEdit I split this into two questions. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq24132238765419The other part is here.ap

Negative 102794 pI am creating a blackjack simulator in R and came upon an unexpected issue.  In the hit function, I want to remove a card from the deck, which is stored as a data frame.  The deletion works, however, getting the newly reduced data frame to be recognized in other functions doesnt work.  In other words, when I call the hit function and pass the data frame, deck, a copy of deck is passed.p  pI think this can be handled using reference variables or pointers but I  dont see much discussion of that online with R.  Also, using a global variable for the deck would work but I know that is not very popular.p  pWhen the printstrdeck line is executed from the hit function, the data frame consists of 51 objects which is correct.

Negative 102794 pIm creating a game with loads of asteroids floating in a huge space.

Negative 102794 pIm currently working on some init scripts that should both use codeset ecode and confirm to the a hrefhttprefspecs.linuxbase.orgLSB4.1.0LSBCoregenericLSBCoregenericiniscrptact.html relnofollowLinux Standard Basea core specification. Now those two dont really work togetherp  pSince due to the codeset ecode the first command that fails causes the scripts to exit with the return value of the failed command I cannot set the exit status of the script to something LSB conformant for commands that fail with LSB incompatible return values. I could codeunset ecode before each such command, but thats quite a hassle and in that case Id actually rather not use codeset ecode at allp  pI guess another way to achieve the same result as with codeunset ecode would be to do something likep  precodereturns1  return 1   ...  cmdthatfailswithnonLSBreturnvalues  returns1 codepre  pbut that seems quite bulky as well and Id again have to check each and every commands possible return values.p  pIs there a way to set the error code returned by the script when it is terminated due to codeset ecode to a fixed value so it would return 1 i.e. LSB generalunspecified error no mather what return value the failed command had Should I not bother with LSB conformant return codes andor set e this will probably turn into a discussion about the merrits of codeset ecode anyway judging from the amount of search results you get for thatp  pSmall code snippet to illustrate the problemp  precodebinbash  init script for service foo set e  start    echo bar   cmdfailswithreturncode3  script exits with return code 3, not LSB conformant   echo baz   ...  case 1 in   start     start        ... esac codepre

Note When I choose the jar it populates the Driver Class text box with codeorg.postgresql.Drivercode which is not the same as the one in the question title, but if I click the find button next to the text box it says Searching for driver classes with a progress bar and then under it an info symbol saying Driver class is missing. If I press the find button again it populates it with the values that were there after selecting the jar.p  pI then try to create some entity classes from the database, so I select the data source as my codejdbcFYPcode resource and from here there are two scenarios 1. If I have my glassfish installation running then the error The name of the driver class for the datasource is missing appears  2. If it is not running then the error Unable to find the driver org.postgresql.ds.PGSimpleDataSource appears.p  pThis second case seems interesting as it is the driver name it cant find is the same as the one that is set when creating the JDBC connection pool, but is not the same as the driver class that gets sets when registering the driver in NetBeans.p  pEven more interestingweird is that if I create a new connection under the Services tab for the postgresql database and use the driver I created it can create a connection and find the tables absolutely fine.p

Negative 102794 pJumping straight to the topic, Android L introduces a ART as default runtime. I have a Sample Application, basically a document viewer. Most of the document viewing code including back buttons, Search,etc are written in C and the Android App uses JNI interface. I updated my code to make it build for Android L and it seems to open the document just fine. However, when pressing back button and closing the document, the Application seem to crash and the following backtrace is seenp  precodeIDEBUG    1390 Abort message artruntimecheckjni.cc65] JNI DETECTED ERROR IN APPLICATION JNI CallIntMethodV called with pending exception java.lang.StackOverflowError thrown in unknown throw location IDEBUG    1390 backtrace IDEBUG    1390     00 pc 000390d0  systemliblibc.so tgkill12 IDEBUG    1390     01 pc 0001636d  systemliblibc.so pthreadkill64 IDEBUG    1390     02 pc 00016e41  systemliblibc.so raise10 IDEBUG    1390     03 pc 00013cdd  systemliblibc.so libcandroidabort36 IDEBUG    1390     04 pc 000125ac  systemliblibc.so abort4 IDEBUG    1390     05 pc 00230fe9  systemliblibart.so artRuntimeAbort188 IDEBUG    1390     06 pc 000b9571  systemliblibart.so     artLogMessageLogMessage1360 IDEBUG    1390     07 pc 000c28cd  systemliblibart.so artJniAbortchar const, char const1124 IDEBUG    1390     08 pc 000c2e11  systemliblibart.so artJniAbortFchar const, char const, ...68 IDEBUG    1390     09 pc 000c65e9  systemliblibart.so artScopedCheckScopedCheckJNIEnv, int, char const1952 IDEBUG    1390     10 pc 000cc8eb  systemliblibart.so artCheckJNICallIntMethodVJNIEnv, jobject, jmethodID, stdvalist42 codepre  pUpon pressing back button, when file descriptor is supposed to close, CallIntMethodV is invoked, which ultimately fails in check JNI.

So for me there are several optionsp  ul liThe jvm implementation in my case Oracles 1.8.0.20 enforces that the invariants set during construction of an object are visible to all threads.li liThe book is wrong, which I would doubt as the author is Brian Goetz ... nuf saidli liIm doing something wrong in my code aboveli ul  pSo the questions I have  Did someone ever provoke this kind of AssertionError successfully With what code then  Why isnt my code provoking the AssertionError p

Negative 102794 pI am working on a emTabbed Applicationem and have been struggling with a codeCoreDatacode issue for a while now. I will do my best to be clear enough.p  pThe app starts with a tab, which fetches certain types of objects from codeCoreDatacode together with their ToMany relationship and displays the data in a certain way. In another tab, I have a codeUITableViewcode, which uses codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode to display different kind of objects. Both tabs use the same codeNSManagedObjectContextcode. There are additional tabs that do not use CoreData or any previously retrieved objects.p  pWhen I enter the first tab, everything works and is displayed correctly. When I navigate from there to a tab which doesnt use CoreData and go back again, everything is still fine. However, when I navigate to the tab with the codeUITableViewcode and codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode then back again, my objects in the first tab are faulted. This doesnt surprise me much, but I cant seem to be able to fire them. I am trying to access objects ToMany relationship and the codecountcode value, which  from what I know  should fire a faulted object.p  pI am not sure what to think about this behaviour. Can it be that the codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode somehow messes up previous fetches That doesnt sound reasonable...p  pAlso, just so you know, I am using Swift, but that should not be affecting anything.p  pAny input will be appreciated Thanksp

Original thread is here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions27137399createanaccess2013databasefileandsendtouserviaservlet titleOriginal ThreadOriginal Threada p  pI am using Jackcess to create a V2010 mdb file that I need to transfer to a client that will use Access 2013 to open it.  Jackcess itself works  V2010 creates a file that Access 2013 can open when the file is FTPd to the client by a third party software, such as FAR.  However, when I try to upload this file to the client through the servlet as is the goal of this project, Access on the client says Unrecognized database format ...file name....  This is the code used for upload.  Code itself works, file is transferred, has a nonzero size if its saved  but Access cannot open it.p  pNote, for content type I also tried vnd.msassess and octedstream, with same unsuccessful results.  Also, I tried closing the db and creating the FileInputStream from the file name, and, as in the example, tried to create FileInputStream by calling mydb.getFile.

Negative 102794 pI am scripting for a Sharepoint application in its Production environment which uses NTLM Authorization. The recording is working fine, but I am facing 401Unauthorized error while playback of the same script. Since this is an NTLM authorization application, the launch of the application redirects to the Homepage without asking for the login credentials. The first HTTP request of the script which is a GET Method throws 401 Unauthorized error. Ive used HTTP Authorization Manager, HTTP Cookie Manager, HTTP Cache Manager. The same config elements are used in the scripts for UAT env which works fine and such issue is never experienced in the UAT environment.

Is there a way to access this from the doFilterInternal method p  pThe problem is that without having access to info set on the methods themselves, we have to look at the url in the filter to determine if the method falls into this specific category. it gets ugly quickly to be like p  precodeif url  foo  url  bar ... etc codepre  pand ideally we could just sayp  precodeifmethod.hasAnnotationBlah.class or however it would look  Blah public void controllerMethod... codepre  pand itd be much neater to specify this at the method level. is there a way to do this, or some other way that im missingp

Negative 102794 pHello I was reading up on this problem and people had mentioned that to get click to run on safari and chome you needed to have the code set up like sop  precodeinput[typesubmit]btnIsAddress.bindclick, function event       alertthis is code     selectAddressevent     event.preventDefault     return false  codepre  pThis code works on all browsers on a desktop and will work on Chrome, Dolphin and Mercury on an iPad but it will not work on safari on an iPad go figure the most used one... Instead it will treat the button as if its just text, it doesnt even try to run someone or give me the little click animation when pressed.p  pHowever I have noticed that if I let the iPad go to sleep mode while on the page then turn the iPad back on the button will work with no problem. p  pHas anyone else run into this sort of problem before Im guessing its something to do with my javascript but it seems like pretty simple script...p

Looking at the itemized view, I couldnt find any obvious differences.  I assume posting raw data for comparison would reveal a lot, but again, I dont really know how to do that.li listrongemI had a bewildering revelation.emstrong  Despite the response clearly stating 401 Unauthorized, the post is in fact being accepted by the router  Driving in to the routers web config after my WebClient post shows that the settings were accepted and saved.li ul  pThat last one is a biggie.

Negative 102794 pI have a programming problem that I want to know if it can be solved using Java design techniques.  I have class Service and I have a class Client. A client requests a service and if its not already existing, then it will be created i.e. new service object.  If the service has been created i.e by a different client or even the same client, then the Service class will not create a new object.  Instead, the client can be added to the service if not already added. Other fields and methods of the Service class will be applied to clients of the same service.p  precodepublic class Service     private String service   private ArrayListltIntegergt clients   .... other field        public Service String s     this.service  s     clients  new ArrayListltgt          public void addClientint c     clients.addc         ..other methods    public class Client     private int clientID   private ArrayListltStringgt services    public Clientint id     clientID  id     services  new ArrayListltgt       public void addServiceString s     services.adds       public void requestService      forint i0 iltservices.sizei         Service s  new Serviceservices.geti       codepre  pThe problem with the above approach is that new service objects with the same service would be created by different clients.p  pIm currently reading up on on static factory. As far as my research goesp  precodepublic class Service  private Service     public static Service createServiceString service      if service doesnt exist        return new Serivce      else        return null     ....  codepre  pThis above code would prevent creating a new object instance. However, if service already exists and therefore returns null, then a new client cannot join or use that particular service.p
Negative 102794 pSo it was hard to get my question in to a single line. Basically, I have a bunch of generated boxes from a php script and they need to be the same height. There is a short description within each box which is half hidden, when you hover the box expands to reveal the rest of the content. p  pMy question is, is it possible to make the full row underneath move down the expanded amount without the div jumping to the left. If you hover over div 1, youll see div 4 jump to the left and cause a knock on effect which is unappealing, however if you hover over div 3 youll notice the full second row moves down in a unified fashion. Im not sure enitrely why this happens for one and not the other.

Negative 102794 pMy task is or was simple There is a variety but finite types of Post, each with a vastly different set of properties while all sharing a couple core properties like Title, Content, Published, etcp  pWhat I set out to do, was create a base codePostcode entity with all the shared properties as mentioned above, and have this entity as sort of a Governor entity, but more on that in a second.  All the different codeCategorycode entities would extend off of this base Post entity. p  pI did it this way mostly to appeal to the strengths of the Symfony Form API. There are just way too many fields per different Category type to warrant not doing something a bit automated. With the Form API, I can have Symfony use Doctrine to automatically create the editable fields on a page and populate each field with the acquired value when editing or blank if unpopulated or new, without me having to individually provide them in HTML. p  pWhen I said Governor I meant I also wanted the base Post to have its own Repository, and ideally no associated table. This repository could be used to do certain tasks which is Post Type agnostic, such as a codefindAllcode override that would query each of the Category repositories and merge the results into one result for examplep  pIdeally I just wanted to define the unique property of each category in exactly one location, the Entity, and it would reflect across the entirety of the site. Rather than defining it in the entity, the Edit Form, the front end, table fields, etc. p  pstrongthe problemstrongp  pIt seems to be messing up the built in queries which I have not overridden. p  pconsider please note the bolded textp  blockquote   pAn exception occurred while executing SELECT strongt1.idstrong AS id2, t1.title   AS title3, t1.slug AS slug4, t1.dateadded AS dateadded5,   t1.dateupdated AS dateupdated6, t1.content AS content7, t1.published   AS published8, t1.uid AS uid9, em[SENSITIVE FIELDS REDACTED]em FROM   PostCategoryTest t1 WHERE strongt0.id  strong with params [1]p      pSQLSTATE[42S22] Column not found 1054 Unknown column t0.id in   where clausep blockquote  pThis is caused when I call a basic codethisgtgetDoctrinegtgetRepositoryPostCategoryTestDoctrinePathgtfind1codep  pstrongThe sourcestrongp  pCommonBundleEntityPost.phpp  precodeltphp  namespace CommonBundleEntity  use DoctrineORMMapping as ORM     Post     ORMEntityrepositoryClassCommonBundleEntityPostRepository   abstract class Post             var integer             ORMColumnnameid, typeinteger       ORMId       ORMGeneratedValuestrategyAUTO           protected id             var string             ORMColumnnametitle, typestring, length255           protected title             var string             ORMColumnnameslug, typestring, length255           protected slug      ... and so on and so fourth  codepre  pCommonBundleEntityPostCategoryTest.phpp  precodeltphp  namespace CommonBundleEntity  use DoctrineORMMapping as ORM      Post     ORMTableoptionscommentPost subclass   ORMEntityrepositoryClassCommonBundleEntityPostCategoryTestRepository   class PostCategoryTest extends Post      const DoctrinePath  CommonBundlePostCategoryTest       ... all sensitive information redacted, sorry      setup just like a standard entity however, nothing special   codepre  pI do understand theres many more ways to accomplish this, and I may just go ahead and do that as this has provided a few more headaches than I had expected.

Negative 102794 pAs the title states, Ive inadvertently set the font size to something gargantuan in Android studio and its now totally unusable. At most I see the tops of a few letters once the program loads, so I cant even get back into the options to reduce the font size. Looking through the config files has given me no joy, so I am looking for some way of adjusting the settings from outside the program itself or deleting all user customised settings and starting again without completely deleting everything. I had tried to uninstall and reinstall, which worked for a short while then the font went back from normal to huge. p  pEdit Ive managed to fix it for now at least by moving the .AndroidStudio1.2 file from my users folder and starting Android Studio again allowing it to reset. p

Using the ironform with the post method, I only get the form data as codeformData [object Object]code, which makes things totally useless on the backend that does not get the form element values ever. p  pSuch behaviour can be seen on the ironform demo page a hrefhttpselements.polymerproject.orgelementsironformviewdemodemoindex.htmlhttpselements.polymerproject.orgelementsironformviewdemodemoindex.htmlap  pIs there any way to send a post using ironform and keep the regular post behaviourpli ol  pOn searching on StackOverflow, this thread seems to take care of a similar problem a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions31121305sendingformwithpostmethodandpolymerironformSending form with POST method and Polymer ironforma, although the fix did not work for me as I seem to be using the 1.0.8 version.p  precodebower ironform1.0.0 validate 1.0.8 against gitgithub.comPolymerElementsironform.git1.0.0 codepre  pstrongThe reason for the formData [object Object]strong So it seems that the problem is solved in ironajax1.0.4 I am using bower with PolymerElementsironelements as a dependency that only bumps until the version 1.0.0 of ironajax, once i forced ironajax to use v1.0.4 the the Payload from the form post seems to be corrected.p  pThis issue is what drove me there a hrefhttpsgithub.comPolymerElementsironajaxpull80httpsgithub.comPolymerElementsironajaxpull80ap

Negative 102794 pI have an SSIS package that uses SQL statements to pull data from 10 Postgres databases with identical schemas but different data.  The package is written into a job with 10 tasks, each task has hardcoded values indicating which server to pull data from.  The source SQL doesnt change, and the db schemas across 10 source servers are identical, but the data is different.  Basically, were running a data extract against 10 instances of an apps backend on a loop.p  pWe use a 32bit ODBC driver to connect to Postgres from SQL Server 2008 R2 via system DSN connections.  We dont use fetch because it works for larger reports but fails for smaller ones.p  pOn the target SQL Server side, after each run the result data from each SQL statement just gets appended to the same table with a source id.  This way we can query a single table for any or all of the 10 sources data.  Each day the package runs, everything gets truncated and reloaded.  On the source side, the data is staged for us via backuprestore around 6 am our jobs start around 8 am.  The SSIS ETL dumps the data into the intake bucket, and the actual final insert into the userfacing tables happens via a stored procedure.p  pTo summarize,p  pWe have a package with several SQL data transformation tasks.  It hits 10 PG databases one at a time via global variables in job tasks.  It loads data into intake tables, and then a stored proc inserts into final customer tables.p  pHeres the weird problem I am having  sometimes everything loads correctly, but sometimes I only get half of the data, sometimes nothing at all.  Some tasks complete, some say they are complete but target tables contain no data.  When I run the package manually by kicking off the job via tsql or opening it in Visual Studio, everything works 100 of the time.  As soon as I schedule the package, I cant get any consistency.  Ive tried scheduling them during different times of day to no avail ... I checked with upstream people to make sure I am not pulling when they are pushing, but all that seems to be OK.p  pThe only thing I can think of is some obscure timeout settings in SSIS that kill the jobs when they run long.  I can understand all results or no results, but halfway loaded tables I dont understand.  Can anyone point me in the right direction  Thanks.p

Negative 102794 pI am looking for a solution to parse html with Ruby. I need a solution similar to Apache Tika with an option to extract main content of any page, not just a particular website.p  pExamples. If that is a news article, I would be interested to extract an article with its title form a page skipping the rest. If its a StackOverflow question, I would only want title, question, replies. If its a picture with a title, I would only keep title. p  pBeing completely new to Ruby, I have looked at html parsing gems a hrefhttpswww.rubytoolbox.comcategorieshtmlparsing relnofollowherea that included Nokogiri and others. But I would really appreciate directly pointing me out how do I do it if thats possible.p  pWhile alternative solutions are interesting, I would like to mention that I cannot use Apache Tika as an app, but only in a server mode, so it does not provide an option to extract main context. On the other hand, main code that used to call Tika is in Ruby, so I need Ruby solution.p
