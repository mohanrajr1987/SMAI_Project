Positive 2404 pIm using Scala as my language.  Im using Google Objectify as my persistence API to store objects into Google App Engines Datastore.  Any class that is to be stored in the Google App Engine Datastore via Objectify has to have a Entity annotation prefixing the class. You typically apply this annotation to your own classes for use in your own app or domain.  In one my classes, Id like to be able to define a class attribute of type Option[String].  In order to do that, I would need to be able to apply the Entity or Subclass annotation Objectify annotations to the Option class.  But that is a builtin Scala language type.  Is there a way to use implicit classes or types or Scala macros to do monkey patching to the language to allow me add that annotation, afterthefact, to a builtin Scala language typep

Positive 2404 pI have a framework where all objects with a certain framework annotation have to be considered to also have the codeConditionalcode Spring annotation to work. I would rather abstract Spring and also simplify the API for my consumers. For example, my consumer has classes codeFooOnecode and codeFooTwocode which have annotation codeBarcode  I want codeFooOnecode and codeFooTwocode to automatically be considered to have a codeConditionalBaz.classcode annotation.p  precodeBarblahblah ConditionalBaz.class  I want this to be implicit public class FooOne       stuff   Barblahblahblah ConditionalBaz.class  I want this to be implicit public class FooTwo       stuff   RetentionRetentionPolicy.RUNTIME Inherited Configuration ConditionalBaz.class  see second bullet below public interface Bar       stuff   public class Baz implements Condition      Override     public boolean matchesConditionContext conditionContext, AnnotatedTypeMetadata annotatedTypeMetadata          MapltString,Objectgt barMetaData  annotatedTypeMetadata.getAnnotationAttributesBar          do stuff         return something       codepre  pI had two ideasp  ul liAdd the codeConditionalcode annotation on a base class codeBaseBarcode and my framework consumers codeFooOnecode, codeFooTwocode should inherit from the base class. But the codeConditionalcode annotation is not inherited as specified in the JavaDoc so Spring wont bother reading the codeConditionalcode annotation on the base class.li liUse the codeConditionalcode annotation as a metaannotation on one of my existing annotations e.g. codeBarcode applied to this class. In this case, Spring is reading the codeConditionalcode annotation but the codeAnnotatedTypeMetaDatacode passed into the codeConditioncode now represents the metaannotations on the annotation codeBarcode rather than on the class itself codeFooOnecode, codeFooTwocode. This is not helpful to me as I need to read the actual class annotations within the codeConditioncode reading the metadata of codeBarcode within codeBazcode.li ul  pIs there any way to get around this  any other options available For example, is there any way to get access to those class annotations when codeConditionalcode is used as a metaannotation Or is there any way to wrap codeConditionalcode to make it inherited Or any way to extend Springs codeConditionalcoderesolving code to make it more suitable for this usecasep

Positive 2404 pim very new to Mapkit, so probably missing something quite simple here, but have really cant find an answer so far.  I am reading an array of teacher information and location and then creating annotations with custom call outs. There is a disclosure accessory on the call out. When the disclosure is tapped it passes me via a segue to a teachers details view controller. However to pass the correct parameters to the teachers detail view controller I need to get the index of the array from the annotation. For example, if I press the call out disclosure button of the 5th teacher in the array I need to be able to understand in the code that this is the 5th teacher and so then I can easily pass the 5th element of my array to the view controller. Currently I do get the segue to the detail view controller, but because of the index not working, it gives me the wrong person when the view controller opens. Ive tried looking everywhere and am not getting anywhere now with this, here is the current code I have. I would be eternally grateful for any help with this onep  pIn View Did Loadp  precode GET MY LESSONS FROM DATABASE      NSURL urlcc  [NSURL URLWithStringurlString]      dispatchasyncdispatchgetglobalqueueDISPATCHQUEUEPRIORITYDEFAULT, 0,          NSData data  [NSData dataWithContentsOfURLurlcc]         NSError error         NSMutableDictionary jsonDict  [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithDatadata optionskNilOptions                                                                           erroramperror]          jsonTeach  jsonDict         NSLogMy Lessons Json  , jsonTeach          NSMutableArray mapPointsArray  [[NSMutableArray alloc]init]         CLLocationCoordinate2D location         MKPointAnnotation  myAnn           LOAD ANNOTATION ARRAYS INTO mapPointsArray         for int i0 ilt jsonTeach.count i               myAnn  [[MKPointAnnotation alloc] init]               SET UP LOCATION             location.latitude  [[jsonTeach[i] valueForKeyPath address.latitude]floatValue]             location.longitude  [[jsonTeach[i] valueForKeyPath address.longitude]floatValue]             myAnn.coordinate  location               LOAD TITLES                     myAnn.title  [jsonTeach[i] valueForKeyPath firstName]                  [self.mapView addAnnotationmyAnn]             annotationIndex  i                       MKAnnotationView mapViewMKMapView mapView viewForAnnotationid ltMKAnnotationgtannotation       If its the user location, just return nil.     if [annotation isKindOfClass[MKUserLocation class]]         return nil       Handle any custom annotations.     if [annotation isKindOfClass[MKPointAnnotation class]]               Try to dequeue an existing pin view first.

Positive 2404 pCould you please clarify the actual purpose of this annotation    What happens if we dont have corresponding constraint defined using SQL Table definition in DB.

Positive 2404 pIm using an annotation processor to generate a source file.  This works, the class gets added in targetclasses and I can import it and use it as expected.p  pIts kind of annoying though because everywhere I use that source file intellij highlights it as red because it doesnt know about it.p  pIs it possible to somehow add that generated file somewhere that intellij knows about it and can use it to autocomplete things  I realize the file would potentially be slightly dated because it might change the next time the annotation processor is invoked, but Im okay with that because it is fairly static.  I could also copy the file to my main src directory but that doesnt seem very DRY.p

Positive 2404 pI decided to use TomEE OpenEJB in my Junit test simply because IBMs EmbeddedEJBContainer is too limited. For example, it doesnt support MDB.p  pSo, I added a number of dependencies into my Maven POM.xml and got all necessary OpenEJB jars into my test code. In the BeforeClass method I created the EmbeddedContainer p  precodetestEJBContainer  EJBContainer.createEJBContainer codepre  pAnd this was successful. So, I thought the EJB annotation for injection would also work. But it didnt. Then I went on to interrogate the JNDI contexts used by OpenEJB. I found my EJB reference was bounded in the following subcontexts like p  pjavaglobalMyModuleMyEJBcom.company.dept.MyEJB   and javaglobalMyModuleMyEJB   p  pSo, they were there. However, the EJB annotation injection failed. So, I went on to search for tomcat annotation implementation for the EJB annotation method. I wasnt able to find that. p  pWondering what may be wrong here. A few things I can think ofp  ol liThe jar containing the EJB annotation for OpenEJB is not called. That is, some other jar implementing javax.ejb.EJB intercepted tomcats call.li liThe subcontext name is wrong.li ol  pI wanted to bind the MyEJB reference myself to the JNDI context for the injection to work but not able to match up the actual subcontext name. Could you please point me to the right directionp  pSincerely,p  pStudent101p

Negative 2404 pOK, please disregard what has gone before. Im not getting the errors anymore, so it seems my problem is with getting a Chart to update when I change the values to which the Chart is data bound.p  pDisregard below herep  pHi all. I have a WinForms application that has a panel, codepanel1code. A background thread creates some other controls that then get added to codepanel1code like sop  precodepanel1.Controls.AddRangemyArrayOfControls codepre  pThis works great and I can see my controls get added. But, when new data comes in on another thread, I update values in the controls parent objects and then need to codeRefreshcode to get the display to update with the new values. Calling codeRefreshcode in either context, the thread where the data comes in or the objects that receive the updated data causes an InvalidOperation exception because Invoke is required. Ive tried using Invoke in my model objects and also the thread where the data is incoming and cant seem to shake the error.p  pIf anyone has some guidance Id greatly appreciate it.p  pUPDATE Heres a little more info. I didnt think it would require it, but I was wrong. p  pI have an object class MyObject. This MyObject class gets created in a thread called topologyThread. Data comes in on dataThread. Instances of MyObject have a Panel instance variable and the Panel has child Controls including two Charts from the System.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization.Charting namespace. So, as data comes in on dataThread, I update the respective data values in the MyObject objects and then need to refresh the Charts to show the updated data.p  pI do know the data is processing fine. In my MyObject class, Im logging the new values to Console in the setter for the property and see the new values show up.p

Negative 2404 pIn a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions873620howdoiclearthisarraypointerincthisa previous question I posted most of my own shell code. My next step is to implement foreground and background process execution and properly wait for them to terminate so they dont stay as zombies.p  pBefore adding the possibility to run them in the background, all processes were running in the foreground. And for that, I simply called waitNULL after executing any process with execvp. Now, I check for the amp character as the last argument and if its there, run the process in the background by not calling waitNULL and the process can run happily in the background will Im returned to my shell.p  pThis is all working properly I think, the problem now, is that I also need to call wait or waitpid  somehow so that the background process doesnt remain zombie. Thats my problem, Im not sure how to do that...p  pI believe I have to handle SIGCHLD and do something there, but I have yet to fully understand when the SIGCHLD signal is sent because I tried to also add waitNULL to childSignalHandler but it didnt work because as soon as I executed a process in the background, the childSignalHandler function was called and consequently, the waitNULL, meaning I couldnt do anything with my shell until the background process finished. Which wasnt running on the background anymore because of the wait in the signal handler.p  pWhat am I missing in all thisp  pOne last thing, part of this exercise I also need to print the changes of the processes status, like process termination.

So somewhere else in the program, I import the entire package, and iterate over the modulespackages it has imported.p  pWhy The package is called codecruncherscode, and inside it there are defined all kinds of crunchers, like codeCruncherThreadcode, codeCruncherProcesscode, and in the future perhaps codeMicroThreadCrunchercode. I want the crunchers package to automatically have all the crunchers that are placed in it, so later in the program when I use codecruncherscode I know it can tell exactly which crunchers I have defined.p  pI know I can solve this if I avoid using functions at all, and do all imports on the main level with codeforcode loops and such. But its ugly and I want to see if I can avoid it.p  pIf anything more is unclear, please ask in comments.p

If I then click on edit I just get an empty page. p  pWhen I say empty, I mean that the part of the page where the readonly list item content was displayed has now gone blank.p  pI suspect that there is an indexdictionarysomething that requires rebuildingp  pThanks in advance,p  pJimp

Negative 2404 pI need to find out if an object with a particular primary key is already attached to a DataContext and get the entity from the DataContext if it is attached.  Is there any way at all to do this that doesnt require Reflection with full trustp  pIdeally, I would like to call GetCachedObject, but Id have to use reflection to get at that, and Im pretty sure Id have to be in full trust mode, which wont work in a hosted environment.p  pIm open to thinking outside the box here.  Also, I can fully control the generated LinqToSql code, so thats not a problem either.  I can rewrite my DataContext class.

Negative 2404 pIve been thinking about whether its possible to apply the DI pattern without incurring the cost of virtual method calls which according to experiments I did can be up to 4 times slower than nonvirtual calls. The first idea I had was to do dependency injection via genericsp  precodesealed class ComponentAltTComponentB, TComponentCgt  IComponentA      where TComponentB  IComponentB     where TComponentC  IComponentC  ...  codepre  pUnfortunately the CLR still does method calls via the interfaces even when concrete implementations of TComponentB and TComponentC are specified as generic type parameters and all of the classes are declared as sealed. The only way to get the CLR to do nonvirtual calls is by changing all of the classes to structs which implement the interfaces. Using struct doesnt really make sense for DI though and makes the issue below even more unsolvable.p  pThe second issue with the above solution is that it cant handle circular references. I cant think of any way, either by C code, or by constructing expression trees, to handle circular references because that would entail infinitely recursing generic types. .Net does support generic types referencing itself, but it doesnt seem to generalize to this case. Since only structs can cause the CLR to bypass the interfaces, I dont think this problem is solvable at all because circular references between structs could cause a paradox.p  pTheres only one other solution I can think of and its guaranteed to work  emit all of the classes from scratch at runtime, maybe basing them on compiled classes as templates. Not really an ideal solution though.p  pAnyone have better ideasp  pEdit In regards to most of the comments, I guess I should say that this is filed under pure intellectual curiosity I debated whether to ask this because I do realize that I dont have any concrete case in which its necessary. I was just thinking about it for fun and was wondering whether anyone else came across this before.p

Negative 2404 pMy program threw a NullPointerException the other day when it tried to use a Handler created on another thread to send that thread a message. The Handler created by the other thread was not yet created, or not yet visible to the calling thread, despite the calling thread having already called start on the other thread. This only happens very rarely. Almost every test run does not get the exception.p  pI was wondering what the best way is to avoid this problem for sure with minimal complication and performance penalty. The program is a game and very performance sensitive, especially once it is running. Therefore I try to avoid using synchronization after setup, for example, and would prefer to avoid spinning on a variable at any time.p  pBackgroundbr In Android the Handler class may be used to enqueue an action to be performed on a different thread than your own. Documentation herebr a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comintldereferenceandroidosHandler.htmlhttpdeveloper.android.comintldereferenceandroidosHandler.htmlap  pThe Handler must be created on the thread where it will be used. So creating it in the constructor of a thread, which is run by the thread creating that thread, is not an option.p  pWhen the Handler is for a thread other than the UI thread, the Looper class must also be usedbr a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comintldereferenceandroidosLooper.htmlhttpdeveloper.android.comintldereferenceandroidosLooper.htmlap  pThe documentation gives this example of using the two classes for this purposep  precodeclass LooperThread extends Thread      public Handler mHandler      public void run          Looper.prepare          mHandler  new Handler              public void handleMessageMessage msg                   process incoming messages here                                Looper.loop       codepre  pMy very ugly workaround currently looks like thisp  precodepublic class LooperThread extends Thread       public volatile Handler mHandler      public final ArrayBlockingQueueltObjectgt setupComplete  new ArrayBlockingQueueltObjectgt1      public void run          Looper.prepare          mHandler  new Handler              public void handleMessageMessage msg                   process incoming messages here                                setupComplete          Looper.loop           public void waitForSetupComplete          while  true               try                  setupComplete.take                 return              catch InterruptedException e                  Ignore and try again.                                 private void setupComplete          while true               try                  setupComplete.putnew Object                 return              catch InterruptedException e                  Ignore and try again.                                      codepre  pWith the code in the creating thread looking like thisp  precode    LooperThread otherThread  new LooperThread     otherThread.start             otherThread.waitForSetupComplete     otherThread.mHandler.sendEmptyMessage0 codepre  pAre there any better solutions Thanks.p

The same goes for the Channels OpenGLChannel, etc. that handle loading of the Channel data to the API.

Negative 2404 pIm working developing a system right now that deals with lots of conversions between semantically different values that have the same primitive .NET type doublestringint.  This means that its possible to get confused about which semantic type you are using, either by not converting or converting too many times.  Ideally Id like the compiler to issue a warningerror if I try to use a value where it doesnt semantically make sense.p  pSome examples to indicate what Im referring top  ul liAngles may be in units of degrees or radians, yet both are represented by codedoublecode.li liVector positions may be in localglobal coordinates, yet both are represented by a codeVector3Dcode struct.li liImagine a SQL library that accepts various query parameters as strings.  Itd be good to have a way of enforcing that only clean strings were allowed to be passed in at runtime, and the only way to get a clean string was to pass through some SQL injection attack preventing logic.li ul  pI believe F has a compiletime solution for this called units of measure.  Id like to do something similar in C, although I dont need the dimensional analysis that units of measure in F offers.p  pI believe C could achieve this using codetypedefcode though Im not a C expert.p  pThe obvious solution is to wrap the doublestringwhatever in a new type to give it the type information the compiler needs.  Im curious if anyone has an alternative solution.  If you do think wrapping is the onlybest way, then please go into some of the downsides of the pattern and any upsides I havent mentioned too.  Im especially concerned about the performance of abstracted primitive numeric types on my calculations at runtime, so whatever solution I come up with must be lightweight both in terms of memory allocation and call dispatch.p

Negative 2404 pIm diving into iOS development and Im playing with touch events.  I have a class named codeUIPuzzlePiececode thats a subclass of codeUIImageViewcode and it represents the puzzle piece objects that you can move around on the screen.

That way the statement code[self setCentercgLocation]code will actually move the UIPuzzlePiece to the location of the touch.  I can always write some hacky algorithm to convert it, but I was hoping theres a better or simpler way to accomplish my goal.  If I only had a single puzzle piece, I would just implement the touch event code inside the view controller of the parent view, but I have many many puzzle pieces, which is why Im handling it inside the UIPuzzlePiece view.p  pYour thoughts Thanks so much in advance for your wisdomp

Which means that the performance hit is related to textures, blending etc.p  pThe next thing I tried was to remove all the drawings, except for the skybox. Rendering the skybox alone made the renderer  jump to 40 from the menu screen, which was at 20.p  pWhat could be happening I tried disabling GLBLEND, and set GLNEAREST to the texture mag filters, but the renderer  is still pretty bad.p  pI tried turning on retina display four times the resolution and the frame rate just bombed.p  pWhat other things could be done to reduce the renderer overhead I suppose there must be something, considering RAGE for iPhone runs at 60fps at retina resolution I havent confirmed that, actually.p

Using a prime and a good hash function usually gives a better distribution of the lengths of the lists hanging off of buckets. Atom uses a power of two, which is sometimes explicitly cited as a bad choice. Write a program to generate or read, say, 10,000 typical strings and measure Atomnews speed and the distribution of the lengths of the lists. Then change buckets so that it has 2,039 entries the largest prime less than 2,048, and repeat the measurements. Does using a prime help How much does your conclusion depend on your specific machinestrongp  pso I did changed that hash table size to 2039,but it seems a prime number actually made a bad distribution of the lengths of the lists, I have tried 64, 61, 61 actually made a bad distribution too.p  pI am just want to know why a prime table size make a bad distribution, is this because the hash function used with Atomnew a bad hash functionp  pI am using this function to print out the lengths of the atom listsp  precodedefine BSIZE 2048 void Atomprintvoid      int i,t     struct atom atom     fori 0iltBSIZEi          t  0         foratombuckets[i]atomatomatomgtlink              t                  printfd ,t       codepre

Negative 2404 pI have a member table that has a foreign key to various other tables. I am checking each of these tables to see if a member has one or more records in it and if they do I return a value, if not I return 0, this is all selected as a total. This is mostly working except in one place. I need to check two tables and if there is a record in either of them the query will return 5,0 otherwise. I am trying to use a SUM of counts with a UNION for this but I am not getting the results I expect, it seems like only the first record in each of the two tables is being selected and that is it. p  pI am usingafter some help  a series of correlated queries with COUNT and IF to get the total. Here is what part of the query looks like p  precodeSELECT  memberid, SELECT IFCOUNTmemberidgt0,10,0 FROM tbl1 WHERE memberid  m.memberid  SELECT IFSUMtblcount gt 0,5,0 FROM         SELECT memberid, COUNTtbl2.id as tblcount      FROM tbl2     UNION ALL     SELECT memberid, COUNTtbl3.id as tblcount      FROM tbl3     sub WHERE sub.memberid  m.memberid  as total FROM members m codepre  pThe actual query joins another 10 or so tables, again the only part that is not working is the SUM of COUNT with the UNION.

Negative 2404 pIm using Google Appengine to run a webapp and Ive run into a bit of a problem. I need to generate a pretty big CSV file and send it to the client. Since there is a 60 second timeout maximum and there is no filesystem to write to, I decided to use SJAX synchronous AJAX I guess to get the data from the server in chunks, conctenate them, and then send it back to the server where the server sends it back to the client as a CSV file. Very annoying. p  pAnyways, this takes a very long time so I thought I would use a progress bar that checks how many chunks have been received against how many there are total.

Negative 2404 pIm trying to get a Gridview select link to drill down to a specific page for the selected row in ASP.NET with C. This gridview is generated dynamically in the pageload, and is databound from a fairly simple SQL select query. Each row has a unique id, and I would like this to be passed as a parameter in the url when the select button is clicked for that row. So, when you click the select button on the row with an id value of 9 note  not the id as defined by the gridview, but the one from the SQL query you are redirected to an address such as moreDetail.aspxid9. p  pHowever, when trying to pass the id into the event handler Ive hit issues... GridView.SelectedIndexChanging takes the usual object sender, EventArgs e as parameters and nothing else, and since the Gridview is created at PageLoad the EventArgs class is useless. I cant seem to find any way to pass the id that I have retrieved earlier into the event handler.p  pAfter lots of searching,I tried creating a class that extends EventArgs obviously with my extra parameter added in, but it seems using any parameters other than object sender, EventArgs e just wont work. I could theoretically redo the SQL query within the event handler, but that seems to me a terrible way to achieve what Im looking for, so Im hoping someone will be able to see what Ive got wrong here, because Im sure Im missing something obvious.p  pSome code  grid.SelectedRow.Cells[0] will contain the parameter I want to passp  pIn PageLoad  p  precodeGridView grid  new GridView   grid.DataSource  source   CommandField selectField  new CommandField   selectField.ShowSelectButton  true   selectField.SelectText  View Jobs   grid.Columns.AddselectField   grid.SelectedIndexChanging  gridSelectedIndexChanging   grid.DataBind   content.Controls.Addgrid   codepre  pAnd the Event Handlerp  precode    protected void gridSelectedIndexChangingobject sender, EventArgs e              Response.RedirectViewCustomer.aspxid  grid.SelectedRow.Cells[0]      codepre  pObviously this doesnt work because the scope of grid doesnt extend to the handler...but how emcanem I get access to that datap
Negative 2404 pProblem Viewing a public Facebook profile without being authenticated into Facebook shows a barebones profile. I have the users accesstoken. Is there any way to use the accesstoken to show the user a profile as if they were authenticated, or authenticate them behind the scenes before sending them to the profile page in order to see the full profilep  pSpecifically, Im loading a Facebook profile in a UiWebView, which does not have access to the cookie pool of Safari, and so the user is not able to see the full profile. The user has already authenticated with my app, and so I have their access token, which Im hoping I can use without forcing them to reauthenticate.p  pI know this is somehow possible because the Foursquare iPhone app accomplishes it. If you look at another users Facebook profile, you are able to see the full profile as if you were logged in. Next step is to sniff the traffic to try to figure it out, but wanted to see if there was an obvious solution I was missing first.p

Negative 2404 pI am currently working on a project where i need to have an in memory structure for my map task. I have made some calculations and i can say that i dont need more than 600MB of memory for every map task.  But the thing is that after a while i have java heap space problems or gc overhead limit. I dont know how can this be possible.p  pHere are some more details. I have two, quadcore system with 12GB of ram. So that means that i can have up to 8 map tasks running at the same time. I am building a tree, so i have an iterative algorithm that does a mapreduce job for every tree level. My algorithm works fine for small datasets, but for a medium dataset has heap space problems. My algorithm reaches a certain tree level and then it goes out of heap space, or has gc overhead problems. At that point, i made some calculations and i saw that every task doesnt need more than 100MB memory. So for 8 tasks, i am using about 800MB of memory. I dont know what is going on. I even updated my hadoopenv.sh file with these linesp  precode   export HADOOPHEAPSIZE8000    export HADOOPOPTSXXUseParallelGC codepre  pWhat is the problem Does these lines even override the java options for my system Using parallelGC is something that i saw on the internet and it was recommended when having multiple cores. p  precode     edits codepre  pOk here are some edits after monitoring heap space and total memory. I consume about 3500MB of RAM when running 6 task at the same time. That means that jobtracker, tasktracker, namenode, datanode, secondary namenode my operating system and 6 tasks all use 3500 of RAM which is a very logical size. So why do i get a gc overhead limit I follow the same algorithm for every tree level. The only thing that changes is the number of nodes in every tree level. Having many nodes in a tree level, does not add so much overhead to my algorithm. So why cant the gc work wellp

The DataGrid has baked   in functionality for transactional editing via the IEditableObject   interface.  When you begin editing a cell, the DataGrid gets into cell   editing mode as well as row editing mode.  What this means is that you   can cancelcommit cells as well as cancelcommit rows.  For example, I   edit cell 0 and press tab to the next cell.  Cell 0 is committed when   pressing tab.  I start typing in cell 1 and realize I want to cancel   the operation.  I press Esc which reverts cell 1.  I now realize I   want to cancel the whole operation so I press Esc again and now cell   0 is reverted back to its original value.p blockquote  pI get this same transactional behavior even without implementing IEditableObject.

For example in my db I might change some fields at the same time of 10000 records and this may happen 0, 1 or 1000 times a day etc. The point is that each time I update a value in the db I want it to be updated in solr too so I can search with the updated data each time. p  pFor those of you that have used solr, how fast can re indexing in such volumes be Will this update delete and readd a record from what i read and its indexing for example cost 5seconds, 5 minutes , one hour , what Consider it will be running on a good server. p

Negative 2404 pstrongDisclaimerstrong Im fully aware that the best way to represent emdatetimesem is either Unix timestamps or PHPs codeDateTimecode class and Oracles codeDATEcode data type.p  pWith that out of the way, Im wondering what the most appropriate data types are in PHP, as well as Oracle for storing just strongtimestrong data.  Im not interested in storing a strongdatestrong component only the time.p  pFor example, say I had an codeemployeecode entity, for which I wanted to store hisher typical work schedule.  This employee might work 800am  500pm.  There are no emdateem components to these times, so what should be used to store them and represent themp  pOptions I have consideredp  ol liAs strings, with a standard format likely 24hour HHMMSSZ.li liAs numbers in the range 0 lt n lt 24, with fractional parts representing minutesseconds not able to store timezone info.li liAs PHP codeDateTimecode and Oracle codeDATEcode with normalizedunused date component, such as code00010101code.li liSame as above, only using Unix timestamps instead PHP codeintegercode and Oracle codeTIMESTAMPcode.li ol  pCurrently Im using 3 above, but it sort of irks me that it seems like Im misusing these data types.  However, it provides the best usability as far as I can tell.  Comparisons and sorts all work as expected in both PHP and Unix, timezone data can be maintained, and theres not really any special manipulation needed for displaying the data.p  pAm I overlooking anything, or is there a more appropriate wayp

Negative 2404 pIn my Django project that aggregates NBA player stats as a learning project, Ive built a simple search view that allows you to search for players by first or last name or both.  It works totally fine on the dev server, but now I want to deploy my site using Google App Engine, and Im getting errors that I believe are due to GAEs High Replication Datastore.p  pI was under the impression that the a hrefhttpwww.allbuttonspressed.comblogdjango201009GetSQLfeaturesonNoSQLwithdjangodbindexer relnofollowDjangononreldbindexera tools would help alleviate this problem, but so far Ive tried implementing them to no availwhen I attempt a search on my site, I get an error log with the message DatabaseError This query is not supported by the database.p  pIm guessing my problem might be that the instructions for these tools are spread across multiple docs written at different points in their development, so its tricky for me to put them together into one coherent picture.  Also, Ive looked at the testapp they offer and it seems to be set up somewhat differently than their instructions would suggest.

Negative 2404 pI am using an itemizedOverlay within my MapView that is generating waypoints.  I have the ability to modify, add, delete these waypoints as desired.  This MapView shares the screen as a fragment with a listView fragment.  Currently the purpose of the fragment is to display the waypoints from the map and allow them to be deleted, moved, or whatever using the listFragment.  All of this works as of right now.p  pThe issue I have is that both fragments hold their own copy of the waypoint list.  I.E. if I delete a waypoint using the mapview, the itemizedOverlay class must call the ListFragment function to remove a waypoint from its own list.  This gets ugly and will have its own problems soon.  It would be better to have a single list either in the listView, itemizedOverlay, or a separate class file.p  pIn other applications C or Java based, I have typically created another class as a singleton and it holds the information that would be shared between the map and listview.  Is this still the best way to handle the issue when working with Android, or is there another better, builtin option to usep

Negative 2404 pLets assume we have a 2000 email list with newsletter subscribers and we need to mass email them. Servers do have hourly limitations when sending emails to prevent SPAM.p  pSome have 300 or even 500 emails per hour which is fair enough.p  pWhile using swiftmailer throttle plugin to send for example 8 emails per minute 8  60 minutes  480 total mails which is under the 500 limit server closes the connection and responds with a 404  Not found page.p  pThe weird thing is that it has sent 100 or less email during script execution but still server treats the procedure as it has fallen to an infinite loop and terminates the script execution.p  pIf I try to send 500 emails at once without the throttle plugin it works like a charm. But what if I need to send more emails like 1500 or 2000p  pIve read the the throttle plugin uses PHPs native function codesleepcode which should work properly in a situation like this one.p  pI was informed that it could work if the process is executed through Cron Job and not through the HTTP protocol. Ive tried that using wget and curl to set up the cron job but still no luck.p  pWhat Ive learned from the research I conducted is that when using an SMTP server with Swiftmailer a 3 second process takes 28 seconds way longer than it should. All queries all optimized and all data are properly placed in memory without overloading the server.p  pAfter that I decided to give it a shot without using SMTP but the Throttler Plugin didnt work as it should again.p  pAny suggestions or recommendations would be highly appreciated.p  pstrongEDITstrong Ive also read this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12178364swiftmailerbatchemailtimesmyserveroutrq1SwiftMailer Batch email times my Server outap  pOf course I use thisp  precodeignoreuseraborttrue settimelimit0 inisetmaxexecutiontime, 0 inisetmemorylimit, 256M inisetmysql.connecttimeout, 500 inisetdefaultsockettimeout, 500 codepre  pP.S.

Negative 2404 pIve been looking hard to find a web page editor that can let me visually edit an alreadydesigned asp.net web form page. for the whole period, Ive made my page designs with Dreamweaver now Im using Dreamweaver CS4 and transfered my designs to Visual Studio 2010 to make asp.net pages from that template. Table editing feature for web forms in Visual Studio is really annoying and by trying to change a column width, the table structure is corrupted and VS decides to change everything on that table compare it with Dreamweaver which only changes those two columns which their border is changed instead of the whole columns of that table.p  pUnfortunately Dreamweaver does not recognize the asp.net tags syntax and because of that it can not properly render them in design mode.

Negative 2404 pAlright, Ive been racking my brain, reading up excel programming for dummies, and looking all over the place but Im stressing over this little problem I have here. Im completely new to vba programming, or really any programming language but Im trying my best to get a handle on it.p  pThe Scenario and what my goal isp  pThe picture below is a sample of a huge long list of data I have from different stream stations. The sample only holds two niobrara and snake to illustrate my problem, but in reality I have a little over 80 stations worth of data, each varying in the amount of stress periods COLUMN B.p  pCOLUMN A, is the station name column. COLUMN B, stress period number COLUMN C, modeled rate COLUMN D, estimated ratep  pWhat I have been TRYING to figure out is how to make a macro that will loop through the station names COLUMN A and for each UNIQUE Group of station names, make a chart that will pop out to the right of the group, say in the COLUMN E area. p  pThe chart is completely simple, it just needs two series scatterplotline chart one series with COLUMN B as xvalue and COLUMN C as yvalue and the other series needs COLUMN B as xvalue and COLUMN D as yvalue. p  pNow my main ordeal, is that I dont know how to make the macro distinguish between station names, use all the data relating to that name to make the chart, then looping on to the next Station group and creating a chart that corresponds for that, and to continue looping through all 80 station names in COLUMN A and to make the corresponding 80 charts to the right of it all in somewhere like the  COLUMN E.p  pIf I had enough points to bounty this, I would in a heartbeat. But since I do not, whoever can solve my dilemma would receive my sincere gratitude in helping me understand run this problem smoothly and hopefully better my understanding of scenarios like this in the future. If there is anymore information that I need to clarify to make my question more understandable please comment your query and Id be happy to explain in more detail the subject.p  pCheers.p  pOh, and for extra credit now that I think about it, I manually entered the numbers in COLUMN B. Since the loop would need to use that column as the xvalue it would be important if it could loop through itself and fill that column on its own before it made the chart I would imagine it would have something to do with anything as simple as counting out the rows that correspond to the station name. But again, I know not the proper terminology to correspond the station name, hence the pickle Im in however if the veteran programmer who is savvy enough to answer this question could, Id imagine such a piece of code would be simple enough yet crucial to the success of such a macro I seek.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com80uDf.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 2404 pI have a function that returns an IO action,p  precodef  Int gt IO Int codepre  pI would like to compute this function in parallel for multiple values of the argument. My naive implementation was as followsp  precodeimport Control.Parallel.Strategies  vals  [1..10] main  do       results lt mapM f vals       let results  results using parList rseq       mapM print results codepre  pMy reasoning for this was that the first codemapMcode binds something of type codeIO [Int]code to coderesultscode, coderesultscode applies a parallel strategy to the contained list, and the codemapMcode finally requests the actual values by printing them  but what is to be printed is already sparked in parallel, so the program should parallelize.p  pAfter being happy that it does indeed use all my CPUs, I noticed that the program is less effective as in wall clock time when being run with codeRTS N8code than without any RTS flags. The only explanation I can think of is that the first codemapMcode has to sequence  i.e. perform  all the IO actions already, but that would not lead to ineffectivity, but make the codeN8code execution as effective as the unparallelized one, because all the work is done by the master thread. Running the program with codeRTS N8 scode yields codeSPARKS 36 11 converted, 0 overflowed, 0 dud, 21 GCd, 4 fizzledcode, which surely isnt optimal, but unfortunately I cant make any sense of it.p  pI suppose Ive found one of the beginners stepping stones in Haskell parallelization or the internals of the IO monad.

Negative 2404 pIf we have a source control branch that we use to stop features and bug test including additional commits on this branch to fix said bugs, what should it be calledp  pIs Release Candidate appropriatep  pMy thoughts are that such a branch would be called Release and that using the word candidate implies it is immutable. You can have candidate 1 and candidate 2, but those specific candidates should never change ie. candidate 1 wouldnt have any commits, that would modify it in any way.p  pLinks or examples would be great, as the person I was discussing this with is very hard headed.p  pRelated question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions588533isthereanyspecificationforpromotingareleasecandidateIs there any specification for promoting a release candidatea covers how finished RC can be consideredp

Negative 2404 pMy application uses gridview to display some items and I want some dragdrop in that gridview. Basically user can pick an item and move it to different position. Thats not hard to implement but Ive stumbled on a small problem. Which is codepointToPositioncode returning codeINVALIDPOSITIONcode when the point is embetweenem two grid cells. Which is understandable but doesnt really help  in my case Im showing user a preview of what the order will be as he is dragging stuff around and when he is dragging over the spacing I suddenly dont know what I should show.p  pOne solution is to remove spacing actually. But I still want some visual spacing between tiles.p  pTheres a chance Im missing some way of calculating the closest tile to given position.p  pWhat would be the best way to have gridview with visualonly spacing between elementsp  pMy current temporary final solution is not to use backgrounds at all and draw them directly into gridview background.

Negative 2404 pI am trying to do error communication and recovery in my C code without using Exceptions. To give an example, suppose there is a Func A, which can be called by Func B or Func C or other functions. Func A has to be designed keeping reuse in mind. This application has an evolving library where new features will keep getting added over a period of timep  pIf Func A is not able to do what it is supposed to do, it returns an int, where any nonzero value indicates failure. I also want to communicate the reason for failure. The caller function can use this information in multiple waysp  ol liIt can show the error message to the user, li liIt may display its own error message more relevant to its contextli liIt may itself return an int value indicating failure to further ancestor caller functions.li liIt may try to recover from the error, using some intelligent algorithm.li ol  pHypothetically, any function on which other functions depend, may need to communicate multiple things to its caller function to take appropriate action, including status code, error message, and other variables indicating the state of data. Returning everything as a delimited string may not allow the caller function to retrieve the information without parsing the string which will lead to its own problems and is not recommended. p  pThe only other way is to return an object containing member variables for all required information. This may lead to too many state objects, as each function will need to have its state object.p  pI want to understand how this requirement can be designed in the most elegant way. Note that at the time of coding, Func A may not know whether the caller function will have the intelligence to recover from the error or not, so I do not want to throw exceptions. Also, I want to see whether such a design is possible and elegant at the same time without using exceptions.p  pIf the only way is to communicate using data objects for each function, then is it the way professional libraries are written. Can there be a generic data object Note new functions may be added in future, which may have different state variables, or supporting information about their errors.p  pAlso note that since the functions return value is a state object, the actual data what it is supposed to return may need to be passed as a ref or out parameter.p  pIs there a design pattern for thisp  pI have read the following articles before posting this questionp  pa hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combricomarchive2003121944697.aspx relnofollowhttpblogs.msdn.combricomarchive2003121944697.aspxap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1308432dotrycatchblockshurtperformancewhenexceptionsarenotthrownDo trycatch blocks hurt performance when exceptions are not thrownap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1272342errorhandlingwithoutexceptionsrq1Error Handling without Exceptionsap  pI have read many other articles also, which suggest not to use exceptions for code flow control, and for errors which are recoverable. Also, throwing exceptions have their own cost. Moreover, if the caller function wants to recover from exception thrown by each of the called functions, it will have to surround each function call with a try catch block, as a generic try catch block will not allow to continue from the next line of the error line.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pA few specific questions I need to write an application which will synchronize 2 different databases one is a proprietory database, and the other is a SQL Server database. I want to encapsulate reusable functions in a separate layer.p  pThe functionality is like this The proprietory application can have many databases. Some information from each of these databases needs to be pushed to a single common SQL Server database. The proprietory applications databases can be read only when the applications GUI is open and it can be read only through XML.p  pThe algorithm is like thisp  ol liRead List of Open databases in Proprietory Applicationli liFor each database, start Sync process.li liCheck whether the user currently logged in, in this database has the Sync Permission.

If ReadListOfDatabases is not able to establish a connection with the Proprietory Application, the caller should automatically start the application, etc.p  pSo which error conditions should be communicated should exceptions and which using return codesp  pNote the reusable functions may be used in other projects, where the caller may have different error recovery requirements or capabilities, so that has to be kept in mind.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pFor all those advocating exceptions, I ask them If Func A calls Func B,C,D,E,F,G and Func B throws an exception on some error condition, but Func A can recover from this error and will like to continue rest of execution i.e. call Func B,C,D,..., how does exception handling allow to do this elegantly The only solution will be to wrap calls to each of B,C,D,... within a try catch block, so that remaining statements get executed.p  pPlease also read these 2 commentsp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma12791371113579httpstackoverflow.coma12791371113579ap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma12725471113579httpstackoverflow.coma12725471113579ap  pstrongNotestrong I am not averse to using exceptions, if error recovery and remaining code execution can be achieved emelegantlyem and without impacting performance. Also, slight performance impact is not a concern, but I prefer the design should be scalable and elegant.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOk, Based on Zdeslav Vojkovic comments, I am now thinking about using exceptions.p  pIf I were to use exceptions, can you give some use case when not to use exception, but use return codes strongNotestrong I am talking about return emcodesem, not the data which function is supposed to return. Is there any use case of using return codes to indicate success  failure, or no use case That will help me understand better.p  pOne use case of exceptions what I have understood from Zdeslav Vojkovic is when the callee function wants to compulsorily notify caller function of some condition and interrupt the caller execution. In the absence of exception, the caller may or may not choose to examine the return codes. But in case of exceptions, the caller function must necessarily handle the exception, emif it wants to continue executionem.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI had another interesting idea. Any callee function which wants to support the idea of caller function recovering from its error can raise event, and check the event data after the event has been handled, and then decide to throw or not to throw exception. Error codes will not be used at all. Exceptions will be used for unrecovered errors. Basically when a callee function is unable to do what its contract says, it asks for help in the form of any available event handlers. Still if it is not able to perform the contract, it throws an exception. The advantage is that the added overhead of throwing exceptions is reduced, and exceptions are thrown only when the callee function or any of its caller functions are not able to recover from the error.p  pSuppose if the caller function does not want to handle the error, but rather the callers caller function wants to handle the error, the custom event dispatcher will ensure that event handlers are called in the reverse order of event registration, i.e. the most recently registered event handler should be called prior to other registered event handlers, and if this event handler is able to resolve the error, the subsequent event handlers are not at all called. On the other hand, if the most recent event handler can not resolve the error, the event chain will propagate to the next handler.p  pPlease give feedback on this approach.p

Negative 2404 pWe have a peculiar situation here that is causing our automated tests to fail on a newly created lab environment, using TFS 2012.p  pWeve always had a bunch of unit tests that tested our DAL code, which in turn uses the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarymicrosoft.practices.enterpriselibrary.data28vpandp.3129.aspx relnofollowEnterprise Library Data Application Blocka to perform operations on the database. This was setup quite a few years ago, to enable our clients to choose either SqlServer or Oracle databases alongside our product, taking advantage of the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarymicrosoft.practices.enterpriselibrary.data.databasefactory28vpandp.3129.aspx relnofollowDatabaseFactorya class and all the supporting generic interfaces and classes in the entlib.data. I mentioned unit like this because these are actually not pure unit tests but integration ones, seeing as they require a real database to work.p  pTo test the same SQL code against both databases, we maintain two separate .config files inside a Resources folder in our TFS project branch, pointing to our test databasesp  ul licodeResourcesSqlServerConnectionStrings.configcode SqlServer specific connection stringsli licodeResourcesOracleConnectionStrings.configcode Oracle specific connection stringsli ul  pIn the root Resources folder, there are two accompanying .testsettings files, responsible for deploying files specific to each databasep  ul licodeResourcesSqlServer.testsettingscode which deploys the SqlServerConnectionStrings.config fileli licodeResourcesOracle.testsettingscode which deploys the OracleConnectionStrings.config fileli ul  pSince the whole structure is in source control, the testsettings is able to find the .config files by using relative paths, allowing us to test everything without having to setup parameters manually. On devs machines, we always select the codeSqlServer.testsettingscode file when running the tests, so that they dont need to have the whole oracle environment installed to validate their changes before checking in the code. The Oracle side of the validation always occurred in our build process, where we actually test every method twice first using the same codeSqlServer.testsettingscode used by the developers, and then using the codeOracle.testsettingscode.p  pThis way, we can setup our test assemblies app.configs to redirect the connectionStrings node to an external file, like thisp  precodeltconfigurationgt   ltconnectionStrings configSourceConnectionStrings.configgt   ... codepre  pWhen the tests are run, mstest copies the adequate ConnectionStrings.config file to the tests working folder, based on which .testsettings was used to initiate the run.p  pThis was working fine until today, when I discovered that a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsvstudioenUS229fe0b35ebc4e7e9cd5c63bbf1f7052additionaldeploymentitemsforautomatedcodeduiteststartedfrommicrosofttestmanager relnofollowtests started through Microsoft Test Manager ignore the Visual Studio .testsettings filesa. Now Im trying to run these same tests in our lab environment but the ConnectionStrings.config files are not deployed understandably and the tests fail.p  pHow can we achieve this without using .testsettings files After having huge headaches trying to setup oracle correctly in our new x64 build server, we disabled Oracle tests in the build definition. Now that we started setting up our lab environment, we thought about having one of the machines in it configured with our whole system using Oracle, enabling us to again run these unit tests with oraclespecific connection strings to validate our queries. At the same time, we want to keep testing everything locally and on the build server using SqlServer also.p  pI think using a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarymicrosoft.visualstudio.testtools.unittesting.deploymentitemattribute28vvs.8029.aspx relnofollowcode[DeploymentItem]codea in this case is impossible, since it is meant for static files and not selectable, dynamic ones like our current setup.p  pIs there any equivalent to the .testsettings deployment process that we could use with TestCases inside MTMLab Env On the codePropertiescode tab for our TestPlan, I can see the codeAutomated Runs gt Test Settingscode option, but that only seems to allow deployment by specifying absolute paths which will actually be resolved on the target machines. Is there a way to specify a relative path there, pointing to our ConnectionStrings.config files checked in on TFS Maybe yet another alternative exists that Im missing, perhaps using multiple build configurationsp

Negative 2404 pAs I am aware we can do various types of event handling based on completion of a background thread on C and I am also aware that we can use AsyncTask in android to handle background threads. but in their completion is it possible to do any event handling tasks on android.

Negative 2404 pIm trying to take an existing working code base and make it object oriented using JavaScript. My system takes JSON containing emgroupsem and emitemsem in a onetomany relationship, and visualizes this on a page. The items can be moved into different groups, and their positioning within those groups also needs to be calculated. As such, events will need to be established which are aware of both the groups and tickets around them.p  pIm using a hrefhttpejohn.orgblogsimplejavascriptinheritance relnofollowJohn Resigsa simple JavaScript inheritence setup to establish two classes, codeItemcode and codeGroupcode. When each codeItemcode is instantiated it refers back to its parent codeGroupcode. strongMy issuestrong arises when I want to establish my events, and is most easily explained by the following functionp  precodevar Group  Class.extend   ...    Calculate where to place the new item within the group   calculatenewposition functionitem      var pos  1      Loop through all DOM items in groups body     .item, this.elBody.eachfunctioni          Retrieve its class object       var next  this.dataobj         Calculating things using the class reference       var lowerPrio  item.tData.priority lt next.tData.priority,           lowerId   item.id lt next.id        iflowerPrio  lowerId          pos  i         return false                 return pos   ,   ...  codepre  pNote the use of the code.dataobjcode in the above snippet. Essentially, when I need to do something like sorting the items, then I need to know the object model corresponding to every items DOM viewcontroller in the group. Now, I could establish my codeGroupcode class so that when I create each codeItemcode I add a reference to it from within my codeGroupcode e.g. so codeGroup.items  [i1, i2...]code, and then rather than iterating over the DOM elements, I could iterate over the codeItemcode instances. However I think Id run into similar problems down the line, such as when I want to move an codeItemcode into a different codeGroupcode as the codeGroupcode would not know about the codeItemcode. p  pstrongLong story shortstrong is it intrinsically dangerousnaivepointless to have a class which when instantiated creates a DOM element, which then in turn points back to the class This feels like circular dependency, and some recursive nightmare, but perhaps a reference to an object isnt such a terrible thing. If Im doing anything else emreallyem stupid, and theres a much simpler way, then please point that out as well.p

At the top of my main source file, I have declarations like thisp  precodeinclude configstm32plus.h include configdisplaytft.h  using namespace stm32plus using namespace stm32plusdisplay  typedef Fsmc16BitAccessModeltFsmcBank1NorSram1gt LcdAccessMode typedef SSD1289Landscape64KltLcdAccessModegt LcdPanel  LcdAccessMode accessMode LcdPanel dsp Font font codepre  ptheres more, but it looks something like that this section is for the display, theres more for the SD card and other components. I mostly understand whats going on here. One of my functions in this file looks like thisp  precodetemplate ltclass Tgt void printT text      textxdspgtmeasureStringtext     dspltltPointtextx,textyltlttext  void println      textx0     textyfontgtgetHeight1  template ltclass Tgt void printlnT text      printtext     println  codepre  pNow, I wanted to try and move this into a separate file or class Print.cpp and Print.h, but after trying all sorts of different things like extern class, including the whole library, forward declarations, and after googling over 10 different errors I got trying to compile that code, and googling what Im trying to do, I simply cannot find any solution. I would post examples of what Ive tried, but I deleted all my previous attempts, and they didnt work at all anyway.p  pSo, can anyone give me an example of a class or way to put these functions in a separate fileclass so I can use it in the main program, while still allowing the main program to use display functionsp  pAny helpadvice is appreciated. Note that Im still new to C, and that this is an embedded system, so RAM is limited I cant make another instance of the display objectsclassesp

Negative 2404 pI have a SQL procedure that I call often around 1025 times a second.  The procedure itself is very well optimized, however, the preprocessing for this procedure requires a configuration based on the parameters there are a few thousand configurations that are possible.  This configuration is stored in the database as well and changes roughly once a day to once a month.p  pCurrently I have it set up with a cache of configurations that I use to hold configurations that have recently been used so I dont have to query the database for the configuration every time.  The cache times out configurations after 30 minutes so if the configuration changes it will see it.p  pThere are a couple problems with thisp  p1  If the configuration changes it may take up to 30 minutes to see the change.p  p2  If the configurations time out at different times on different running instances, the procedure will be run with different configurations at the same time.p  pSo my question is  Is there any way to do this better   I dont want to query the database for the configuration every time but I also want to have the configuration updated as soon as it is changed.p  pOne alternative I am considering is versioning the configuration in the database and checking the version from the database against the cache for every call.  The problem with this is that it adds another query every time I call the procedure.  Im not sure what affect it will have on the load of the database.p  pAny suggestions are greatly appreciatedp

Negative 2404 pIm doing a Node.js project that contains sub projects. One sub project will have one Mongodb database and Mongoose will be use for wrapping and querying db. But the problem is p  ul liMongoose doesnt allow to use multiple databases in single mongoose instance as the models are build on one connection.li lipTo use multiple mongoose instances, Node.js doesnt allow multiple module instances as it has caching system in require. I know disable module caching in Node.js but I think it is not the good solution as it is only need for mongoose. p  pIve tried to use createConnection and openSet in mongoose, but it was not the solution.p  pIve tried to deep copy the mongoose instance a hrefhttpblog.imaginea.comdeepcopyinjavascripthttpblog.imaginea.comdeepcopyinjavascripta  to pass new mongoose instances to the sub project, but it throwing RangeError Maximum call stack size exceeded. pli ul  pI want to know is there anyways to use multiple database with mongoose or any workaround for this problem Because I think mongoose is quite easy and fast. Or any other modules as recommendationsp

Negative 2404 pI understand Indy developers have chosen to strip BCC headers of the message when using codeSaveToStreamcode because stream can be socketbased. But what if I want to actually save the message into the stream for further processing Furthermore, what if I wanted to strip the CRLF.CRLF added after the end The example of this would be saving a message to MBOXtype file. This of course cannot be done directly.p  pSo my approach right now is a real messp  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecode Writing to MBOX  Save to temp file IdMsggtSaveToFilefilenamewrite.tmp,false   Make file shorter by 5 trailing bytes boostscopedptrltTFileStreamgt fsnew TFileStreamfilenamewrite.tmp, fmOpenWrite  fmShareDenyWrite fsgtSize  fsgtSize5 FlushFileBuffersreinterpretcastltvoid gtfsgtHandle   Now this file can be copied to another stream with mboxlike file. codepre  pAnd for the loadingp  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecode Reading from MBOX boostscopedptrltTFileStreamgt fsnew TFileStreammboxfile, fmOpenRead  fmShareDenyWrite AnsiString Data Data.SetLength12345 fsgtReadconstcastltvoid gtData.data, Data.Length boostscopedptrltTStringListgt slnew TStringList slgtText  Data slgtSaveToFilefilenameread.tmp IdMsggtLoadFromFilefilenameread.tmp codepre  pOf course, this is terribly unefficient way of doing this and completely unnecessary. If it would be possible to save directly to stream it would be 2 lines of code instead of above mess.p  pIs there a better way How about adding an overloaded codeSaveToStreamcode to allow removing CRLF.CRLF and saving BCC header in Indy And similar for codeLoadFromStreamcode when message is loaded from MBOX so it can be loaded directly from stream without the need to add trailing CRLF.CRLF.p

So I tried the code belowp  precodefrom scipy import sparse from multiprocessing import Pool import multiprocessing import functools  def myfuncx,ns     return ns.A[x,]ns.Ans.A[,x]  manager  multiprocessing.Manager Global  manager.Namespace poolPool Global.Asparse.rand10000,10000,0.5,csr myfunc2functools.partialmyfunc,nsGlobal rpool.mapmyfunc2, range100 codepre  pThe code works but not efficient. Only 4 of 16 workers are actually working. The reason is that, I guess, the manager allows only one worker to access the data at a time. Since the data is read only I dont really need a lock. So is there a more efficient way to do thisp  pp.s., I have seen people talking about copyonwrite fork. I dont really understand what it is but it does not work. If I generate A first and do Pool, each process would have a copy of A.p  pThank you in advance. p

Negative 2404 pIm in the process of building a singlepage web application with friendly URLs. As an example, for a chat you could request codechatroomnamecode or codechatroomname2code to connect to a different chatroom. Since this is an SPA however, both of those would lead to the same HTML contents.p  pIs it possible to tell the browser to cache both pages as a single page as in, going to chatroomname would also cache chatroomname2 in the browser, or something that would give a similar effect This way the HTML contents could be large and only have to be loaded once.p  pAlternatively I could do chatroomname or similar, though Id prefer not to if the above is possible.p

Negative 2404 pI am creating an ASP.net application. I fill a ListBox control with items and I use the PreRender event of the Listbox to set its width according to the largest item in the control.p  pBut after the ListBox is rendered, the first time I click an item in the ListBox the PreRender event fires and focus is removed from the ListBox this event fires unnecessarily because the ListBox is already rendered. The second time I click on an item in ListBox the PreRender event doesnt fire and focus is maintained.p  pIs this behaviour normal What could cause this behaviour p  pThe ListBox is filled on PageLoad if is not postback, with a default value. The Listbox is filled on the TextChanged event of a TextBox the TextBox is used for searching in a DBp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI commented out the PreRender event and the behaviour is not gone. Now I am thinking this may be caused by a PostBack from the TextBox when I remove the focus from it and select an item from the ListBox.p  pThe evidence to this regard I have a gif that is shown  between the beginning and end of a request from the TextBox loading indicator and the gif is visible when I select an item from the ListBox for the first time after a render. The second time there is no problem.p  pemUse the AutoPostBack property to specify whether an automatic postback to the server will occur when the TextBox control loses focus. Pressing the ENTER or the TAB key while in the TextBox control is the most common way to change focus.emp  pI have found out why the behaviour I reported happens. Can I somehow make the TextBox not to postback on losing focus It is aleady posting back on TextChanged and it is enough.p

Negative 2404 pI am working on an application that will send OSC control messages, which is, as I understand a datagram packet, from a web page to an OSC Receiver server, such as MaxMSP or Node or any other. p  pI know typically UDP is used because speed is important in the realtime audio visual control work done with OSC which is also the work I will be doing, but I know other methods can be used.p  pRight now for instance, I am sending OSC from the browser to a node.js server using socket.io, and then from the node.js server to Max which is where I ultimately want the data, also using socket.io. I believe this means I am using websockets and the delaylatency has not been bad.  p  pI am curious though, now that WebRTC is out, if I should place the future of my work there. In all of my work with OSC I have always used UDP, and only used the Socket.ioWebsockets connection because I didnt know about WebRTC.p  pAny advice on what I should do. Specifically I am interested in brbr 1. How I could send OSC messages from the browser directly to an OSC server as opposed to going through a node server firstbrbr 2. If I should stay with the NodeSocket.ioWebsocket method for sending OSC data or should I look into WebRTCp

Negative 2404 pSuppose I have some functions written and compiled in Cp  precodeint quicksumint a, int b return ab  int quickmultint a, int b return ab  codepre  pAt strongruntimestrong, Id like to be able to create a combination of these functions, such as codequicksumquickmult5,6,7code and keep that around as a saved procedure that I could execute any time.p  pCurrently, Im getting halfway there by using JavaScript and C together in Qt, where functions like codequicksumcode are defined in C, and then invoked from JavaScript by doing this p  precode    var somestringquicksum5,quicksum4,4     evalsomestring codepre  pNow that works, but the problem is that the combination of these functions is still being managed on the JavaScript side, which means that JS is handling the return from one function before inputting it into another function, rather than C running the entire combination itself at least I assume that to be the case.p  pI dont mind creating the initial combination in JS but for performance reasons I dont want JS involved every time I need to call the combination of functions.p  pIs there a way to somehow get this combination of functions into the C side and have it stay there for running later I dont mind taking JS out of the process entirely, its just the only method I could think of perhaps there is some clever way of using functors in C for dynamically stitching together functions at runtime that have been previously compiledp  pUpdate...p  pAnother option I am considering is to use functors that themselves have member variables that refer to other functors. This would be a bit like creating a new function with a closure at runtime if the JS called a functor constructor with parameters of other functors. Then this functor would entirely be a C object with the procedure stored within I think. I will need to work this out in my head for a bit.p

Negative 2404 pI am running a play app written in Scala working with PostgreSQL via Slick in development mode. New Relic agents are installed both on play and on the server. The system is an Ubuntu 12.04.3 x64 on a VPS. It has only 1 GiB of RAM and Play refused to start after we brought the Wordpress site up on that machine, but then I added a swap file and everything worked sort of fine. Every once in a while Play application just stops with this weird Killed message on the console. No error messages precede this one, the log is clean before the termination. Application.log doesnt contain anything abnormal either. After that linux console glitches enter does not create a prompt on the new line and pressing up does not bring previous command to the console, but pressing up followed by enter restarts an app. I would really like to know the cause of this problem.p

Negative 2404 pI have an application which calculates 2 simple averages and 1 complex average. The problem is that the average is calculated from 9 values entered in 9 edit texts, and even if the application is working perfect, the edittexts on other size of screen are not arranged anymore. I tried several things to make it work, but nothing so far, so, I decided that it would be much easier to have only 1 edittext, in the case of simple averages, and the button. In the edittext to enter as much as values as you want, and after every value entered to click on a  button, and then, when you entered the all values you wanted, to press an  button which shows in the same edittext where you entered the values the average of the values you entered. In the case of the complex average, to have 2 edit text and like in the first, to calculate the average from the values entered in the first, making a simple average, and with the value from the second edittext to calculate the complex average. Hope you understood exactly and could help me with this.

Negative 2404 pOk, so I have come across a problem that seems like most others have too, but their explainations are either, you cannot do it, or its too vague for the computer to understand that it is using indexes for a vertice and another for textures. I have heard a lot that you should put a vertex struct that has a position, a texture coordinates, and a normal. But it does not help if I UV map my object that I import from an obj file. So there will be some indexes for the same vertex, but having a different index for a texture coordinate. So how am I able to tell opengl how to grab multiple indices, and use one for vertices, one for texture coordinates, and one for colors the colors are simple, they are all the same thing, but I still need to specify that opengl need to use itp  pWhat I have now indices only the vertex arrays indexes.p  precodeprivate void InitiateBeforeDraw       Vertex Buffer     Gl.glGenBuffers1, out VertexId     Gl.glBindBufferGl.GLARRAYBUFFER, VertexId     Gl.glBufferDataGl.GLARRAYBUFFER, IntPtrVertices.Length, Vertices, Gl.GLSTATICDRAW     Gl.glBindBufferGl.GLARRAYBUFFER, 0       Color Buffer     Gl.glGenBuffers1, out ColorId     Gl.glBindBufferGl.GLARRAYBUFFER, ColorId     Gl.glBufferDataGl.GLARRAYBUFFER, IntPtrColors.Length, Colors, Gl.GLSTATICDRAW     Gl.glBindBufferGl.GLARRAYBUFFER, 0       Texture Buffer     Gl.glGenBuffers1, out TexCoordId     Gl.glBindBufferGl.GLARRAYBUFFER, TexCoordId     Gl.glBufferDataGl.GLARRAYBUFFER, IntPtrUVs.Length, UVs, Gl.GLSTATICDRAW     Gl.glBindBufferGl.GLARRAYBUFFER, 0       Index Buffer     Gl.glGenBuffers1, out IndexId     Gl.glBindBufferGl.GLELEMENTARRAYBUFFER, IndexId     Gl.glBufferDataGl.GLELEMENTARRAYBUFFER, IntPtrFaces.Length, Faces, Gl.GLSTATICDRAW     Gl.glBindBufferGl.GLELEMENTARRAYBUFFER, 0   private void SetupPointers       Vertex     Gl.glBindBufferGl.GLARRAYBUFFER, VertexId     Gl.glEnableClientStateGl.GLVERTEXARRAY     Gl.glVertexPointer3, Gl.GLDOUBLE, 0, Vertices     Gl.glVertexAttribPointer0, 3, Gl.GLDOUBLE, Gl.GLFALSE, 0, 0       Color     Gl.glBindBufferGl.GLARRAYBUFFER, ColorId     Gl.glEnableClientStateGl.GLCOLORARRAY     Gl.glColorPointer4, Gl.GLFLOAT, 0, Colors     Gl.glVertexAttribPointer1, 4, Gl.GLFLOAT, Gl.GLFALSE, 0, 0       Texture     Gl.glBindBufferGl.GLARRAYBUFFER, TexCoordId     Gl.glEnableClientStateGl.GLTEXTURECOORDARRAY     Gl.glTexCoordPointer2, Gl.GLFLOAT, 0, UVs     Gl.glVertexAttribPointer2, 2, Gl.GLFLOAT, Gl.GLFALSE, 0, 0       Index     Gl.glBindBufferGl.GLELEMENTARRAYBUFFER, IndexId   public void Draw      ifbInitiated              InitiateBeforeDraw         bInitiated true           SetupPointers      Gl.glDrawElementsGl.GLTRIANGLES, Faces.Length, Gl.GLUNSIGNEDINT, Faces      Gl.glDisableClientStateGl.GLVERTEXARRAY     Gl.glDisableClientStateGl.GLCOLORARRAY     Gl.glDisableClientStateGl.GLTEXTURECOORDARRAY  codepre  pI am also attaching a simple cube put into obj file formp  precodemtllib Cube.mtl o Cube v 10.000000 10.000000 10.000000 v 10.000000 10.000000 10.000000 v 10.000000 10.000000 10.000000 v 10.000000 10.000000 10.000000 v 10.000000 10.000000 10.000000 v 10.000000 10.000000 10.000000 v 10.000000 10.000000 10.000000 v 10.000000 10.000000 10.000000 vt 0.000087 0.250044 vt 0.250043 0.250044 vt 0.250043 0.500000 vt 0.500000 0.000087 vt 0.500000 0.250044 vt 0.749956 0.500001 vt 0.499999 0.500000 vt 0.250042 0.749957 vt 0.749956 0.250044 vt 0.999913 0.250044 vt 0.999913 0.500001 vt 0.000087 0.500000 vt 0.250042 0.000087 vt 0.499999 0.749957 usemtl MatCube s off f 61 22 13 f 74 35 22 f 86 47 35 f 58 13 47 f 22 35 47 f 79 610 511 f 512 61 13 f 613 74 22 f 79 86 35 f 814 58 47 f 13 22 47 f 86 79 511 codepre  pNow if you dont see what the problem is already, look at the first f, which means face, and the first number is 6, which is calling vertex number 6, and the next one to the slash is one, which is calling the texture coordinate number 1. Now on the sixth face, it calls on vertex number 6 again, but this time with texture coordinate number 10. And the next time it pops up is like the first, and the third time it pops up its calling texture coordinate number 13. As you can tell, the problem here isnt that I must hone in all the data into a struct, but actually tell opengl how to index my vertices, textures, colors, and normals with different index indicators.p  pAlthough there is always Make every texture coordinate in your UV image all call the same point for the same vertex, but as easy as that may seem, it has quite a large margin of error and just seems very hard to texture around with, and skinning my models will still have a margin of error.p  pSo how am I able to accomplish thisp

For example, my django code yields this HTML output for leaguesp  precodeltpgtltlabel forchallengeLeaguegtLeagueltlabelgt ltselect idchallengeLeague               namechallengeLeague onChangegetTeamgt     ltoption value selectedselectedgtltoptiongt     ltoption value1gtNBAltoptiongt     ltoption value2gtNFLltoptiongt     ... ltselectgtltpgt codepre  pand this for teamsp  precodeltpgtltlabel forchallengeTeamgtTeamltlabelgt ltselect idchallengeTeam namechallengeTeam onChangegetEventgt     ltoption value selectedselectedgtltoptiongt     ltoption value1436gtArizona Cardinalsltoptiongt     ltoption value123gtAtlanta Hawksltoptiongt     ltoption value1810gtAtlanta Falconsltoptiongt     ...     ltselectgtltpgt codepre  pHowever, when I try to access these value fields in Javascript to request more information from the server, I am having success with leagues and not teams.  For examplep  precodedocument.getElementByIdchallengeLeague.value codepre  preturns 1 for NBA as expected, butp  precodedocument.getElementByIdchallengeTeam.value codepre  pdoes not return a numerical value, but rather Arizona Cardinals instead of 1436.p  pAdditionally, when I enter the getElementbyID function for teams into the javascript console it returns a list likep  precodeltselect idchallengeTeam namechallengeTeam onChangegetEventgt     ltoption valueArizona CardinalsgtArizona Cardinalsltoptiongt codepre  preplacing the value integer with the name string.  Im fairly experienced with Python, learning django, and a javascript newbie.  So I tend to debug in that reverse order, so far unsuccessfully.p  pKnow what could be wrongp  pEDITp  pFor more information, both the League and Team form fields are generated in python as sop  precodeself.fields[challengeLeague]  forms.ModelChoiceFieldquerysetLeague.objects.all, widgetforms.SelectattrsonChangegetTeam codepre  pwhere getTeam and getEvent are javascript functions like sop  precodefunction getTeam      var leagueName  document.getElementByIdchallengeLeague.value     var url  http127.0.0.18000gamesleaguename  escapeleagueName     request.openGET, url, true     request.onreadystatechange  updateTeams     request.sendnull    function getEvent      var teamName  document.getElementByIdchallengeTeam.value     var url  http127.0.0.18000gamempteamname  escapeteamName     request.openGET, url, true     request.onreadystatechange  updateEvents     request.sendnull   codepre  pOnly the variable assignment in getEvent is incorrect.  getTeam correctly returns the numerical value.p  pBoth have identical update functionsp  precodefunction updateTeams       if request.readyState  4          if request.status  200              var data  JSON.parserequest.responseText              updateselectselect[namechallengeTeam], data                    else if request.status  404              alert404 error                  else          alertError   request.status                   codepre

Negative 2404 pI am using tablet PC with Android. There is an MS Word document in which I have to draw a large number of small lines. Some of the lines will be red and some will be blue. I draw with pen.  It is very cumbersome to keep changing the color of the line manually  sometimes I need to set the color to red and sometimes to blue. Is there any fast wayp  pFor example, is it possible to write a VBA macro so that when I press a key, then after that whatever lines I draw should be red. When I press another key, then after that whatever lines I draw should be blue. Or, it could be other way also, which means after drawing a line I will press a key and the line will turn red I will press another key and the line will turn blue. Could you suggest me what to write in the macro Or any other solutionp

The Fire TV isnt expected to be a showpiece of my entertainment center, like a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One. Its just supposed to blend into the background and do its job. Because really, this isnt a story about hardware. This is about Amazon getting as many of its services as possible in to my living room.   Setting up the Fire TV is a breeze once I plugged it in and put in my WiFi password, it launched into a video tutorial demonstrating its many features starring a bizarro normcore Doug Funnie character. As with its Kindle Fire tablets, Amazon preloaded my account on the Fire TV before it shipped it to me, so once the tutorial finished you cant skip it, I tried, all of my Amazon content was there right in front of me. Every TV show and movie Id purchased from Instant Video, every photo Id uploaded to Cloud Drive, all there for my consumption. Starting next month, every song I upload to Amazons Cloud Player will be there too.ltbrgt  lth1gtTHE FIRE TVS INTERFACE IS SUBDUED BUT EASY TO SEE AND CONTROL FROM THE COUCHlth1gtltbrgt The interface will look familiar to anyone thats used a Kindle Fire tablet its a basic grid with categories on the left and content on the right.

However, enumerating accurately requires the application to ignore the owner child, in order for the information to be parsed correctly. This pattern repeats throughout other children in the Firebase, and requires specific ignore upkeep in our code. So my question is whether its better to p  ol likeep the information mixed like it is above and have conditions checking for the owner child in my code li liseparate all the information into its own data child, making it easier to parse, but introducing another level of complexity and possibly slowing down queries, or li lisome other solution for associating a users email with each relevant piece of the DB, in order to apply Firebase Security Rulesli ol  pThanksp

Negative 2404 pI use canvas to paint objects that can be dragged around.  If user touches an area with no objects, he can scroll the page. I have a working touch events implementation and have trouble  adding PointerEvents API support.p  pWith touch events API I use event.preventDefault to prevent the scrolling.p  pNow with PointerEvents API it does not work  I get the pointerDown event but no move events and automatic page scrolling kicks in.p  pSo far I have found that you can use the emtouchactionem css property to switch between page scrolling and touch actions, but not a way to do it on pertouch basis. For example a user might scroll the page with one finger and simultaneously move an object with second finger.p

Negative 2404 pIm just learning objectoriented design and am struggling to see how class inheritance can work in a form Im doing in PHP. Im making the search form for an alumni database for internal use. You choose a graduation period to search a five or ten year interval, then you have radio buttons that allow you to search details about the alumnis schooling, OR the details of their degree courses, OR what jobs theyve had. There are multiple options to refine your search once youve chosen one of the radio buttons.p  pSome code is common to all searches. In every search, for example, you must first choose the graduation period. Other than that, the searches are quite different. All the searches are handled by one class at the moment alumniSearch. It works fine, but is 1000 lines longp  pI dont know how to split the class up into subclasses. How does inheritance work when you want to call a parent class first and have that direct to the right child class p  pWould the answer be something like a simple controller script within alumniSearch in pseudocodep  precodeif searchchoice  job search      include jobSearch.php  elseif searchchoice  school search      include schoolSearch.php  ... codepre  pIve looked into abstract methods and interfaces but from what I understand the child class will have to define the abstract methods of its parent. The searches dont have the same methods, so they cant have this common template.p

Negative 2404 pIm working on creating a security library that will be used by several RESTful clients. Im using Java EE 5, Jersey 1.17 and Maven. The clients will use my library to call a third party app using a token. The third party app will then return all the information it has on that token, like expiration, scope and userId.  My idea is to make a filter that will check if there is an Authorization header, and if thats so, it calls the third party app. If the third party app validates the token and returns the tokens info, I need to return that information, stored in a TokenInformation object, back to the resources.

Negative 2404 pI created a webpage several years ago. Back then I was using Adobe GoLive to achieve that. But now, there is no adobe GoLive any more and I dont have a useful application for creating a web project. So what I want to achieve is a good looking online presence for my project. I want to use the new stuff as well, like HTML5 and CSS3. I dont think that I will need beans or J2EE, because it is more about the design and not the functionality. Later on I will include the web project into my Apache server. So the question is which tool can help me to develop a modern website, what would you advice p  pThank Youp

Negative 2404 pI am trying to switch from gruntcontribwatch to gruntestewatch. What I cannot make work is the compilation of coffeesassjade to a new folder.

Negative 2404 pI am running a WordPress query. To determine which posts I want to display, a calculation needs to be run on each post.p  pTo use an example, lets say all of my posts have a custom field, mycustomfield. The value is an integer between 1 and 100.p  pThe user then inputs a number between 1 and 100 as well. For each post, we subtract the users number from the value of mycustomfield. It the result is larger than 10, we display that post in our results.p  pHow do I run that query I cant seem to figure out which direction to go with this.p  pKeep in mind, this is just a simplified example of a complicated problem. Assume that we are actually going to need to run a calculation for every post. I realize that in this simple example, you could solve the equation and figure out the range of values that you should display. This wont work in my realworld usage.p  pHeres an example of how I might want to do it. The problem is, of course, that you cant actually run functions and calculations in the args array. strongThis is merely to demonstrate what Im trying to accomplish, I understand that this is not how an args array works.strongp  precodeargs  array  a  getfieldmycustomfield Im using ACF which uses getfield, not important                 b  userinputtedfield The value the user entered           Display posts where a  b gt 10 Not real code...

Negative 2404 pI am writing an app that requires labels w musical accidental symbols, called sharp and flat  and , respectively. Specifically, I need a label that says c. It is irrelevant to the question what these two symbols mean within a musical context. My apps main font is Open Sans. However, because Open Sans doesnt specify a character for the sharp and flat symbols, it uses a generic sharp and flat symbol that I find unattractive. However, I know that Helvetica Neue or the iOS system font has some well made symbols for sharp and flat, so I decided to change the labels text to an attributed string so I could make the c Open Sans, and the  Helvetica Neue both size 24. I did this through the interface builder. Even though everything looks exactly the way I want in the storyboard, when I launch it in the iOS Simulator, the labels with attributed strings are significantly shrunken from the other labels. I should note that the label has 3 AutoLayout constraints, though these contrasts are positionally related only, not size related.p  pstrongThings I have tried unsuccessfulystrongp  ul liUsing only one fontli liDoubling the font size was too bigli liRemoving autolayout constraintsli ul  pI would greatly appreciate it if someone could explain how to correctly create these labels. I am happy to provide any more information that is needed.p  pThank youp

Negative 2404 pIm using Backbone to create a site where users would interact with content bookmark, star, etc and I want a way to store the content a user has interacted with in the user data. Simple enough, but Im looking for info on the best approach here.p  pI have built a prototype without user accounts data is loaded into localStorage, so the content itself stores the user interaction right now in the metadata of that content, but to open this up to more than one user at a time, I want to change it so that once a user saves a piece of content, the ID or something permanent of that content gets saved into the user account data instead.p  pIm currently using the localStorage adapter and I load the content in on page load, but with Backbone, the ID of the models changes each time. Once I move to a REST db with user accounts, Im not sure how to save the piece of content the user has interacted with in their account details object and be able to reliably use that in the UI.p  pAny help pointing me in the right direction would be great. How are other people solving this Custom uid An id from the db p  pThanks,p  pPaulp
Negative 2404 pI have added the codeUISearchDisplayControllercode via Interface Builder, so all outlets and delegates are wired correctly. What Im doing then is adding the codesearchBarcode to my codenavigationBarcode like thisp  precodeself.navigationItem.titleView  self.searchDisplayController.searchBar codepre  pThis achieves the look I need nicely. However, when I tap on the codesearchBarcode and it becomes active, the codesearchResultsTableViewcode fails to appear... And when I try to log the codeframecode of the codetableViewcode in the codesearchBarShouldBeginEditingcode method, I get code0,0,0,0code.p  pHow can I make the codesearchResultsTableViewcode appearp  pInterestingly, if I dont set the codesearchBarcode as codeself.navigationItem.titleViewcode, but instead do thisp  precodeself.searchDisplayController.displaysSearchBarInNavigationBar  YES codepre  pit looks almost and functions as expected, i.e. codesearchResultsTableViewcode appears. However, it has its disadvantages, like making it difficult to set codesearchBarcode frame without subclassing, or weird behaviour when trying to add subviews to codesearchBarcode. Thats why Id like to make the first option work.p

Negative 2404 pIn my job, I am currently trying to wrap my head around a VB6 to C conversion project for a large tool that someone else built a long time ago.  p  pSomething I have come across is an unfinished Java project called Designer, which generates .designer.cs files before the parsing program is ran on the VB files to build .cs files.

So my question is, is there a straightforward way to spin off an object in a thread and then call functions from it  The model above works very well in this case.  To be honest for my application I can get away with using codestdasynccode and passing everything as arguments to the worker function, but I was curious if there were a way to write the above code in terms of the standard library instead.p  pI guess I can do something likep  precodevoid foosomeArguments     Worker myworker  new Worker     myworkergtdoSomethingsomeArguments     myworkergtrun  codepre  pand thread that, but then everything is encapsulated inside codefoocode.  With Qt Id have access to that threaded object anywhere its in scope.p  pI understand the basics of running a function in another thread with the standard library, but I wondered if what I want is something thats only possible with the help of a larger frameworkp

Negative 2404 pI have a VideoView and sometimes, depending on network performance, it displays the Cant play this video alert even if the video was already playing. The impression I have is that, if the network performance is poor and the buffer runs out, it automatically shows the alert. If I leave it without pressing ok and the buffer fills up again, the video continues playing, and then pressing ok takes back to the video. So its clearly not a matter of formats or codecs, but its like the player is too sensitive with the alert. Is there a way of disabling the alert or increasing the timeout before displaying itp

Negative 2404 pPlease help me understand how back stack works natively when onBackPressed is called.

Negative 2404 pFirst post Here.  I am making a WPF application, and are currently using WIX to create installers in Visual Studio. This works great, but now the client wants to have multilanguage application and installation.p  pWe have implemented localization in the application, so that is ok the user can select language when the application is first started, and the selected language is remembered in user settings.p  pI also know that wix can be configured to create multiple installers, one for each supported language, or autodetect the language of the OS and select that language as default.p  pBut, we really want an installer that lets you select the installation language at the beginning of the installation processso that we dont need to manage 20 installers, and sometimes the OS language might be incorrect for autodetection. We have tested QSetup, and this works fine for creating multilanguage setup.p  pstrongSo now to the essence of the questionstrong If using QSetup or any other setup package, how would one go about to set the selected language in the installer as the selected language of the installed application How can we detect the language selected in the installer and make a script to set that language as the default in the application settings file Has anyone done this with any installation packages, and how did you do itp  pI would like to see that the users dont have to select language twice first for the installation, and then again the first time the application is started the user can change language at any time later.p  pAny thoughts and hints on this would be greatly appreciated. We are not locked to any specific installer, though InstallShield professional is a bit to expensive for us at this moment.p
Negative 2404 pI have a relatively new site that has just started to pick up a bit of traction in the SERPs. My problem is that I have published it and had it indexed with PHP URL extensions, as followsp  precodewww.example.compage.php www.example.comproduct.php codepre  pAnd so on. Obviously it is a fairly easy matter of editing the .htacess file to remove these extensions. So I will end up withp  precodewww.example.compage www.example.comproduct codepre  pNo problems there. p  pBecause the site is still quite small, I can easily change all the links manually to drop the .php extension, and then update the sitemap. So Google, and all users, should have no way of reaching the .php pages, although of course they still exist if you were to manually type them in.p  pBut, because Google has a record of these pages existing even though there are no direct links to reach them now, do I need to implement 301 redirects from the .php pages to the new nonphp pages I.e. will Google try to crawl those pages that are no longer in the sitemap, but once existed In other words, since you can still reach www.example.compage.php , even though will be no link on the site or in the sitemaps that will take you there, would I get penalised for having duplicate content  are 301 redirects basically required when doing this kind of thing, even if there are no links to the content anymorep  pThanks very much.p

Negative 2404 pIve been working on a game engine for a while, I finally finished it and now I want to implement the ability to export a jar file after designing a game in it, but the only possible way I found was using codeJarOutputStreamcode which can copy the class files from your jar directory to another jar, but that isnt what I want, I want to export the INSTANCE of my engine, not the generic code that was already in my class files. Is that possiblep  pWhat Im thinking of doing is when Im ready to export, I would export all the original class files and program an interpreter that would hardcode the project info into a loaderclass.. So the following questions arisep  ul liIs this a good way of doing thingsli liIs there a better way to do it, If so what is it Im pretty sure there isli liHow do commercial game engines export their project as an executableli ul  pThanksp  pEDIT To make it clear on how my engine stores data, it currently saves data in an external file containing all project data, such as assets, game objects, etc..p  pBut I cannot use that as the main method of loading games, because that would make a game very easily moddable Anyone can change the data file changing the game, therefore using the engine without my approval..p  pAs for what I mean by the current instance I just meant that the engine uses an objectoriented approach to create the game, there are no hardcoded values, so if I just copy the classes from my engines jar, that would not run, it would just crash because it does not have a scene to run...p

Negative 2404 pOkay, this seems to be getting the better of me.p  pIve been reading blog after blog, where guys explain how to get this going, but after countless hours of removing, adding, changing, debugging, pullingathair, copious amounts of coffee and no luck in getting this to work, Im turning here for some professional insight.p  pAs the title suggest, Im trying to get angular to work within an MVC 5 with Razor views, but Im experiencing some very weird behavior.p  pFirstly, angular does not kick in on page load. I have to refresh the landing page at least 5  10 times before it kicks in.p  pWhen it eventually works, Chrome goes into overburn, consuming nearly all of the available resources before crashing. Console in developer tools comes up with a message Warning Trying to load angular multiple times.p  pThe error is very descriptive, so I assume that Im loading the layout.cshtml page twice, when the clientside routing eventually kicks in, but each Razor view contains the  Layout  null  call, as it has been explained on so many blogs.p  pIve tried everything I could possibly read up on, and I cannot get passed this issue.p  pFollowing, my codep  pstrongASP.Net Razor Viewstrongp  pstrongem1.

Negative 2404 pCurrently I play around with ironrouters solution for a restful API. For this I use the code.putcode, code.getcode ... methods which are ironrouter has implemented.p  pThis is my example I work withp  precodeRouter.routeapi, whereserver .putfunction    var req   req  this.request   console.logreq.body    this.response.endPUT finished.   codepre  pWhen I execute the following I will get the expected response PUT finishedp  precodecurl XPUT httplocalhost4000api  dname timo codepre  pBut the codeconsole.logreq.bodycode returns a strange value converted to an object.p  pThe returned value isp  precode    name timon     codepre  pIt seems that ironrouter trys to convert the body into an object but did not recognized that the given request string is a valid JSON string.p  pIs there smth I did wrong  I did not find anything helpful yet to prepare ironrouter that the given request body is still JSON. p  pMaybe its a better solution not to tell ironrouter that the given request is a JSON and instead to tell ironrouter that it shouldnt do anything so I can convert the JSON string by myself  p

Negative 2404 pI have a peculiar problem when running my project in Ubuntu 14.04. Here is the scenariop  pI have a codeViewPartcode which containers a codeTableViewercode. The TableViewer has a codeISelectionChangedListenercode attached to it so that it can track the selection of row in the Table.p  pThere is also a codeTableCursorcode for the Table of TableViewer and it has two listeners attached codeKeyAdaptercode to listen to keyboard buttons and codeMenuDetectListenercode.p  pThe problem I faced is that when I want select multiple rows in the table with shift key and mouse click, the key listener is triggered but the selection listener does not work. So multiple rows cant be selectedp  pIn another case, when I want to right click a row to open menu items, only the selection listener is triggered but the menu detect listener does not activate. Only when I click the same row again, the menu detect listener activates because selection listener does not active.p  pThis leads me to believe that there is a conflict between listeners. However, I observed this only on Linux machine, while it works fine on windows.p  pI understand that the problem is pretty unique in my case, however I want to know if anyone faced something similar before and if there is a workaround.p  pSWT Plugin Dependencycodeorg.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.x86643.102.1.v201402061358.jarcodep

Negative 2404 pWe are working on a big Symfony2 project which should be as portable and configurable as possible. As security is super important in our project we use many validation and so on. For example we use assert in the entity and also check requirements in routing.

At the moment these and other consts statuses are stored in the entity as constants but as the project grows we will need more and more constants and fields and routes with validation for these values which will cause many duplications like this. Also if one of our customers want to change the range can cause headaches.  Is it possible to not manually rewrite all the necessary asserts and route requirements but only an external parameter Thx in advance.p
Negative 2404 pI have a strange question and spent more than a week to find a solution.p  pDoes anybody know a possibility how I can adapt the sources from my embedded Jetty server in a way that I can manipulate the whole communication Im especially interested in manipulating the responses used for the TLS v1.2 handshake and the communication with this protocol at any time. I need this for writing a simulation of a system  this system shall be tested in many ways including the described use case.p  pI already created an example which uses a created certificate to start a secured webservice. It is also possible for the web browser to connect to the web service by using HTTPS  so far so good.p  pI set a breakpoint within my HttpServlet class and I reach this breakpoint. The test answer is generated and the answer is sent back The method codewritecode within the class codeIso88591Httpcode is used where I can find the TLS v1.2 encryption p  pI hope I explained the problem in a good way and someone has an idea.p

Negative 2404 pThis is bit of a tricky one. I am not quite sure where to post this. Should it be here on stack, over on the linux forum or on the DB exchange. Ive posted it here anyway.p  pWe have been looking into speeding up the mysql dump process within our office. All the developers have vagrant virtual machines for doing development, the vagrant machine runs the following p  ul limysql version 14.14 Distrib 5.5.41li liubuntu 14.0.4li ul  pI have written a parallel piece of shell code which will take a list of tables and dump them all in parallel into the mysql instance. Normally the mysqldump is reading from a local slave into a development machine. p  pnb the vagrant machines run on a mix of windows and mac machines. With it being a virtual machine, i am making the assumption this isnt an issue.p  pThe parallel code is as follows p  precodefor tbl in cat tmptables.txt do      mysqldump  h x.x.x.x u user ppassword port3306  C quick locktablesfalse SourceDB tbl  mysql u root ppassword targetDB     echo tbl done  amp done wait codepre  pWhen running this in our production environment it works and the dump is faster than doing a linear mysqldump of the whole DB. This has lead me to believe that the above shell code is correct. However we do not get the same speed increase on local machines, it actually increases. I thought this could be something to do with load on either machine.p  pOn production serversp  ul liparallel mysqldump of DB  12mins li lisingle mysqldump of DB  26minsli ul  pOn Vagrant machinep  ul liparallel mysqldump of DB  1hr 50minsli lisingle mysqldump of DB  49minsli ul  pTo eliminate the local slave, I ran the same above parallel shell code but instead of piping into the mysql instance, I saved it to disk as .sql files. One for each table. This was very faster, dumping the whole DB in 7mins. This meant that problem was not in the mysqldump part but in mysql application. I further proved this by then taking them .sql files from disk and feeding them into mysql using the same parallel method above. Again it ran at around 2hrs. So slower.p  pCan anyone help with this, or point me in the right direction.  I am making the assumption it is something to do with mysql config, but cannot figure out.p
Negative 2404 pI have an ASP.NET WebAPI service that serves json results from to a client JS webapp.p  pThe web client uses OData strongv4strong to filter the requests.br The server side uses a thin Entity Framework layer that just applies the OData filter to the returned dataset.p  pThe data in the DB contains a CallStart field containing date emandem time specific to that item.p  pI want, on the client, to be able to apply custom filters to emonlyem the time part of the CallStart field, regardless of the codedatecode part.p  pOn the client, the user specifies an hour, a minute and an operand.br The allowed operands are codege, le, eq, necodep  pWhats the easiest way to achieve this p  pThe first try was to construct an OData expression p  precodefunction getODataFilterhour, minute, operation      return hourCallStart   operation     hour                and minuteCallStart   operation     minute  codepre  pBut of course that does not work.
