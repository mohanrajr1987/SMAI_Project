Positive 8822 pThis is the first time Im trying to compile and use a library on Windows. I downloaded the .exe that contains opencv3.0.0 on the official website and extracted it. I ignored the codebuildcode directory and used the CMake GUI on the codesourcecode directory to output two dirs, one named codesharedcode when I set CMake variable codeBUILDSHAREDcode to codetruecode and one named codestaticcode when I set this variable to codefalsecode.p  pIn the two of them I used codemake installcode in the root and in the codeincludecode directory and I got two similar codeinstallcode directories, the only difference being that the one in codesharedcode has codebincode and codelibcode dir in code.x86mingwcode and the one in codestaticcode has codebincode and codestaticlibcode. I merged them by moving the codestaticlibcode dir next to the codebincode and codelibcode dirs. So now I only have one codeinstallcode dir containing the codeincludecode and all the libraries.p  pThats where I dont really understand how to properly manage compiled libraries on windows.

The directory structure is setup as a superbuild with a codeCMakeLists.txtcode at the top level that builds all the submodules using codeExternalProjectAddcode, resulting in the following structurep  precoderoot   CMakeLists.txt superbuild   gitsubmodule1   gitsubmodule2   usr      lib      include   myproject      CMakeLists.txt project codepre  pThe codeCMakeLists.txtcode looks something like thisp  precodeSET INSTALLPREFIX CMAKESOURCEDIRusr   Install gitsubmodule1 with INSTALLPREFIX as a prefix ExternalProjectAdd ...

I codemakecode at the top level, dependencies are installed into codeusrcode, I codecdcode into codemyprojectcode, I do my work, all the built shared libraries are found and linked, Im happy. p  pHowever, when I go to run an executable on OS X built inside codemyprojectcode, I find that the dynamic libs placed into the codeusrlibcode directory cannot be found. It appears that CMake only sets the codeRPATHcode for libraries embuilt within the project directoryem, which in this case is just codemyprojectcode. p  pIs there any way I can add the custom install location to the the codeRPATHcode for buildtime libraries and executables p  pA few notesp  ul liThis issue only appears to affect OS X. Linux doesnt exhibit these problems at all.li liSetting the codeDYLDLIBRARYPATHcode to include the custom install location works. However, this adds an additional step to the setup, and it gets annoying when I try to debug installation issues. li liSetting the codeDYLDFALLBACKLIBRARYPATHcode also works, although thats also not a good option because it also adds an additional set, and homebrew users wont like this option. li ul

The script uses a method that determines the distance around the zip code entered and returns the zip codes in that radius based on their lonlat.p  pThank youp  pEdit From using the distance function that the script provides I have discovered that the distance between the Zip Codes that the program gives me and my zip code are coming up as 0 miles.p  pstrongMAJOR UPDATEstrongp  pFrom research it turns out that the database has duplicate latlon values.

It checks for things like nonunique character names, empty mandatory fields, etc. If any errors are found, they are displayed.

But how do you save the picture in such a temporary statep  pI cannot prepopulate the file upload field, the browsers dont allow that. If I save it in a temporary file, the picture then has to be cleaned up at some point, because the player can simply close his browser and abort the whole process.

Negative 8822 pI have a simple tank wars style game using the allegro open source library.  In my tank class, I initialize arrays of pointers to bitmap objects to 0.  Then I create new objects with an allegro function createbitmap which allocates the memory and initializes it.p  pThen I go about my business as usual.p  pThe problem is, when I go to release the bitmap memory in the class destructor like a good OO boy, I crash the program because in this specific program, the allegro library does its cleanup which releases the bitmap objects it created before the class goes out of scope and is destroyed.  It doesnt set my pointers to NULL again though so I cant check if the bitmaps are still valid and if I try to release them they will crash the program.p  pIs there any way around this  Can I check for valid pointers if they are not NULL  How can I be SURE that the memory is freed if the class is used a different way within the program.

Negative 8822 pI have a bot that replies to users.

Negative 8822 pIm using SimpleModal to create a popup on an ASP.net application.

Negative 8822 pI have very little knowledge of generics other than how to use them. In my app I have  various ListView Activity that seem to share similar methods and variables and have the exact algorithm in the sense that the steps performed are all very much the same.p  pFor example in my onCreate method I call a method to add a footer, start a progress dialog, call a method to get content based on a xml url and there is a Handler and Runnable fields that is used to call the method to fill the data for the list when the xml parsing is done.p  pI was thinking maybe I can create a BaseListActivity that does all these thingshas methods to all these things and each specific ListActivity can be extended from that. The problem is they use a List object to hold the items that the xml parsed and which the ListAdapter is backed by.p  pSo here is code of the fields usedp  precode list of games from xml private ListltGamegt mGames  new ArrayListltGamegt private ListltGamegt mNewGames  null   Need handler for callbacks to the UI thread private final Handler mHandler  new Handler   Create runnable for posting final Runnable mUpdateResults  new Runnable      public void run          mGames.addAllmNewGames         fillData        LayoutInflater mInflater  null private ProgressDialog mProgressDialog  null private int currentPage  0 codepre  pso really the main difference is that each different activity would use a different object type for the List ie.

Negative 8822 pI need to store the number of plays for every second of a podcast  audio file. This will result in a simple timeline graph like the hits graph in Google Analytics with seconds on the xaxis and plays on the yaxis.p  pHowever, these podcasts could potentially go on for up to 3 hours, and 100,000 plays for each second is not unrealistic. Thats 10,800 seconds with up to 100,000 plays each. Obviously, storing each played second in its own row is unrealistic it would result in 1 billion rows as I want to be able to fetch this raw data fast.p  pSo my question is how do I best go about storing these massive amounts of timeline data p  pOne idea I had was to use a textblob column and then commaseparate the plays, each comma representing a new second in sequence and then the number for the amount of times that second has been played. So if theres 100,000 plays in second 1 and 90,000 plays in second 2 and 95,000 plays in second 3, then I would store it like this 100000,90000,95000,[...] in the textblob column. p  pIs this a feasible way to store such data Is there a better wayp  pThanksp  pEdit the data is being tracked to another source and I only need to update the raw graph data every 15min or so. Hence, fast reads is the main concern. p  pemNote due to nature of this project, each played second will have to be tracked individually in other words, I cant just track start and end of each play.emp

Negative 8822 pI would like to know how I can filter a SharePoint library list based on current user login.p  pSuppose I have created the followings 1 A SharePoint form library containing bunch of uploaded InfoPath form data. 2 The InfoPath form template contains a promoted text field called TargetUser to store user domain login ex DOMAINJOE and every InfoPath form file in the library has a valid domain name stored in the TargetUser field.p  pI have created a custom view for the form library and would like to filter this view so only items whose TargetUser field matches current users login ID are displayed.p  pI went to Edit View page to customize the view and tried to use the [Me] function but I got a Filter value is not a valid text string message instead when clicking OK.  Apparently [Me] returns a PersonGroup data type and the filter cannot compare its value to that of TargetUser.p  pI tried using other text functions ex TEXT[Me], hoping to extract default string value from [Me].  The filter accepted the parameter without any error but the resulting fitlered list does not display any items at all.p  pI have googled this subject but I have not found any solution.p  pIt would be greatly appreciated if anyone can help me to create a functional filtered list. And FYI, my SharePoint 2007 installation is just WSS 3.0  Form Server.  I do not have MOSS 2007 so no MOSS 2007 web parts or web services.p  pThank you.p  pJasonp

Negative 8822 pI want to sync the Core Data on iPhone with MongoDB on Sinatra server.p  pWhen the iPhone gets a message from the Node.js chat server, the message contains the senders BSON ObjectId a string. For the iPhone to store this message, I find the user with that same Id in Core Data. I want to be able to do something like codeobjectWithIDcode. In other words, I want to set the NSManagedObjectIDs to be the same as the MongoDB BSON ObjectIds. The other thing I would check is if there are no users with the senders id in the managedObjectContext, I will fetch him from the persistentStore, and if hes not there, Ill create him. This is a lot to do just to maintain the relationship between Message and Sender. Maybe I should just store the sender attribute of the Message object as his BSON ObjectId as a string instead of as a User NSManagedObject.p  pWhat do you recommend Should I just use MongoDB on the iPhone too I just realized theres an ObjectiveC driver for it. But I was just starting to get the hang of Core Data, and it has cool things like undo support that I might want to use... Right now, Im just using it for simple fetching amp persistent storage, so I could replace it. But I plan to implement undo support in the future, just because I think thats good usability. I prefer the option to undo than having to answer a confirmation popup, e.g., I like how GMail lets you undo a send or undo a deletion of messages, etc.p  pThanksp  pMattp

Negative 8822 pIve wired up codeIPreInsertEventListenercode and codeIPreUpdateEventListenercode to manage audit logging in my app, which is using NHibernate as the ORM layer.p  pThe problem Im having is that the codeOnPreInsertcode event is fired when the object is persisted, but is not fired for each inserted child object as well.p  pIn my case, I have a codeCaninecode, which has a collection of codeCanineHandlerscode.

Personally, Ive used a codeJOINcode or two before, but quickly stopped when I discovered using subqueries because it felt easier and quicker for me to write and maintain.p  pCommonly, Ill do subqueries that may contain one or more subqueries from relative tables.br Consider this examplep  precodeSELECT    SELECT username FROM users WHERE records.userid  userid AS username,   SELECT lastname, firstname FROM users WHERE records.userid  userid AS name,   intimestamp,   outtimestamp FROM records ORDER BY intimestamp codepre  pRarely, Ill do subqueries after the codeWHEREcode clause.br Consider this examplep  precodeSELECT   userid,   SELECT name FROM organizations WHERE SELECT organization FROM locations WHERE records.location  locationid  organizationid AS organizationname FROM records ORDER BY intimestamp codepre  pIn these two cases, would I see any sort of improvement if I decided to rewrite the queries using a codeJOINcodep  pAs more of a blanket question, what are the advantagesdisadvantages of using subqueries or a codeJOINcode Is one way more correct or accepted than the otherp

Negative 8822 pDear fellow iPhoneObjectiveC developersp  pI am working on an application where the user is able to see a list of location objects in a table, and the user can then select a particular row from the table to view that location as an annotation on a map on the next screen.

Negative 8822 pI have a very basic question regarding delegate types. I compared the memebers of Delegate and MulticastDelegate classes in object browser and I couldnt find any new additional member present in MulticastDelegate.

Negative 8822 pThis question mightmight not be related to programming but there is a huge number of programmers that might know what it is.p  pWe have published ASP.NET MVC2 web application that uses Linq on the web server with IIS 7.5.  This web application is automatically copied and served by 2 other servers thanks to Distributed File System set on all 3 servers.  So in total there are 3 web servers on 3 different machines with load balancer configured.p  pNow with this configuration our web application does some weird stuff as processing transaction where there are two inserts to two tables and data is inserted only into one table or it does simple select by id which is primary key and returns more than one record. Also there are some conversion problems and others.p  pThe problem appears only when there is a huge amount of visitors hitting  the website. Otherwise is fine. The very curious thing is when there is only one server switched on and the other 2 are shut down all works finebit slower even with huge volume of usersstress test. No errors no exceptions.p  pAlso we run stress test on the static page which doesnt retrieve any data form db with all 3 servers on and it also works.p  pHas anyone else had this issuep  pFor the web application we use C Asp.Net MVC2, repository pattern, linq to sql Server MS Windows 2008 R2, MS SQL 2008 R2p

Negative 8822 pI want to implement an flex application using actionscript 3 with the camera and the virture buttonslike a image in the camera, one can move his hand to pass over the virture button field in order to fire the button.

Actually, it could work, but it is very sensible to the lighting condition of the background, worse, when there are more than one buttons, people often fire the button by misdike.

Negative 8822 pI have a form that sends a string to my Flask app when the form is posted. The string is a filepath, so Id like to make sure it doesnt contain anything nasty, like code......etcpasswdcode. Werkzeug, which Flask uses, has a handy function called codesecurefilenamecode that strips nasty stuff out of filenames. Unfortunately, when fed a full path like codetemplatesexample.htmlcode, it converts the codecode to codecode, so we end up with codetemplatesexample.htmlcode.p  pIt seems sensible, then, to split the path up into levels, so I send codetemplatescode and codeexample.htmlcode separately and then join them together again on the server. This works great, except that the path can be arbitrarily deep. I could just string together codedir1dir2dir3dir4code and hope that nobody every goes deeper than codedir4code, but that seems dumb.p  pWhats the right way to handle validation of paths of unknown depth Validate differently Send the data differently Encode the path differently, then decode it on the serverp

Negative 8822 pIm trying to write a world clock app that returns the sunrise and sunset information for a given time zone. The thinking is that the user will either specify the GMT offset or give the time zone explicitly.

I realize the time zones are usually not a very accurate way to get geolocation information since they are mostly based on political borders, but it seems like something like this exists. Most of the sitesapis Ive find will give the timezone for the latitude and longitude, but I want to do a reverse search return latitude and longitude for the given time zone.

Negative 8822 pIm a creating a loading screen for website I am making. The website loads many images, scripts, etc. The HTML and CSS part is great, but I need a way to guarantee that the loading... image will be loaded before anything else.p  pIm using jQuery, and everything is initiated within codefunction   ... code. I imagine that the code for this would need to be called beforeoutside that block, and the code to remove the loading screen will be called at the very end of that block. Currently, the loading image is set as a DIV background, which is the way I prefer it. However, if its completely necessary, I will settle for an IMG tag.p  pstrongUpdate solutionstrongp  pI was able to answer my own question by using a combination of Robin and Vlads responses. Both were very good, and excellent answers, however the problem is that they were aimed to load an image before another image, rather than load an image before anything else. CSS, JS, etc...p  pHeres the dirty version of what I came up withp  precodevar files  [new Image, document.createElementlink, document.createElementscript] files[0].setAttributesrc, imagesloading.gif files[1].setAttributerel, stylesheet files[1].setAttributetype, textcss files[1].setAttributehref, test.css files[2].setAttributetype, textjavascript files[2].setAttributesrc, jsjquery1.5.1.min.js window.onload  function e      document.getElementsByTagNamehead[0].appendChildfiles[1]     document.getElementsByTagNamehead[0].appendChildfiles[2]  codepre  pTaking a look at the load sequence on the network tab of Chromes developer console shows that loading.gif is loaded first, then 4 dummy images, then test.css, and then jquery.1.5.1.min.js. The CSS and JS files dont begin to load, until theyve been inserted into the head tag. This is exactly what I want.p  pIm predicting that I may begin to have some problems, however, when I begin to load a list of files. Chrome reports that sometimes the JS file is loaded first, but the majority of the time the CSS file is loaded first. This isnt a problem, except when I begin to add files to load, I will need to ensure that jQuery is loaded before a script file that uses jQuery.p  pIf anyone has a solution for this, or a way to detect when the CSSJS files are finished loading, using this method, then please comment. Though, Im not sure that its going to be a problem yet. I may need to ask a new question in the future about this, if I start to run into problems.p  pThank you to every who has helped with this issue.p  pstrongUpdate glitch fixstrongp  pI ended up running into a lot of problem with this method, because the script files were being loaded asynchronously. If I would clear the browser cache, and then load the page, it would finish loading my jquery dependent files first. Then if I refreshed the page, it would work, because jquery was loaded from cache. I solved this by setting up an array of files to load, then putting the load script into a function. Then I would step through each array item using this codep  precodeelement.onload  function       i step  element.onreadystatechange  function       if loaded  element.readyState  complete  element.readyState  i step   codepre

Negative 8822 pIm developing an add on to a system I have that will allow my clients websites to pull data from it to display on their sites.  p  pNow, most of the time the information being stored in the system is not in any way sensitive because its just published to their website but some users have set up tables that they want to manage in the system out of convenience, but not publish on their website  though they might want to make a request on it ie, to check a customer has a login to their website perhaps, or to grab an email address.  So I need to encrypt the responses to reduce the chances of someone getting the data that shouldnt have it.p  pMy plan is that the user will identify themselves with a user ID, a public key, and the name of a query they want to run which they will have defined in the system itself beforehand  and the request will take a form something like thisp  precoderequirebackendapi.php  myUserID  bobsrestaurant.com myPublicKey  sdg136MAGHYasfadgHGQ send this with the request myPrivateKey  adgljavd8i1356avdilj never send this anywhere queryName  LISTOFDISHES  backend  new backendapi response  backendgtgetDatamyUserID,myPublicKey,queryName  listofdishes  backendgtdecryptresponse,myPrivateKey  user then goes on to use the data in their code or maybe just display it asis. codepre  pIt has to be simple, because the users are either not going to be seasoned PHPers or theyre going to be time poor, and using the system to instead of having to write their own content management solution.p  pAssuming the above user ID and public key were a match, and the query existed and returned data  I was going to have my system encrypt the response to a private key which is known to the user myPrivateKey and which is known to my system, but never exchanged between the two in a request so that it couldnt be intercepted, and I was going to use something like a hrefhttpwww.tonymarston.netphpmysqlencryption.html20040827 relnofollowthis reversible encryption classa to do the encryption.p  pThe problem is, Im going to have to provide users with the decryption class so that they can get the data out of the response.p  pSo if Mr Malicious somehow obtains a user ID and public key belonging to someone else, and he has downloaded a copy of the decryption class from the tutorialuser manual on my systems website, am I right in saying that he wouldnt need to know the private key, because he could just work out how to decrypt it from studying the codep  pIf the answer is yes, what is it that I havent thought of that will prevent that from happeningp

Negative 8822 pI am doing a simple coin flipping experiment for class that involves flipping a certain number of coins on a certain number of threads. To run our performance tests for speedup, we use a fixed number of coinflips Ive been using a billion and change the number of threads. We use AWS extra High CPU instances with 8 cores to run these tests. For some reason, as soon as I use more than 6 threads, I get significant slowdown. Worse than that, it is inconsistent. Sometimes I will get 14 seconds, sometime 2 for the same number of threads and flips. It makes no sense. I have tried using different JVMs OpenJRE and Sun JVM and trying a new instance. Below is my code and the benchmark results in ms. I would love some help. Thanks.p  pEDIT So it seems that I solved it, thanks in big part to the suggestions of yadab and Bruno Reis. They suggested using a local variable to keep track of the number of heads, which I think could have been a factor. They also suggested running all my tests from within the same JVM session, which almost definitely was a factor.

Negative 8822 pIve been struggling with this for some time now. In my project there are several Activities that include a ListView and a custom adapter extending BaseAdapter. They also implement some interfaces which usually inform it that the data has been changed.p  pHowever, when I call the notifyDataSetChanged from the listenerinterface method implemented in my class, the ListView is not updated and none of the adapter methods are called getCount, getView.p  pI know this has something to do with the fact where the notifyDataSetChanged is called from, I mean which thread, but I dont quite understand it and couldnt find a straightforward explanation of this behavior.p  pAs a workaround of this problem I use a Handler which calls a method periodically and in that method I look if a boolean needsToBeUpdated value is true and I call the notifyDataSetChanged method then. This is ugly, though, and I am sure there needs to be a way to do it asynchronously.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p  pPseudocode of what Im talking aboutp  precodepublic class FriendsActivity extends Activity implements FriendsListener  private ListView mListView private ArrayListltFriendsgt mFriendsList private FriendsAdapter mFriendsAdapter private boolean mNeedsToBeUpdated private Handler mListUpdateHandler private Runnable mListUpdateTask  onCreate      initViews     mFriendsAdapter  new FriendsAdaptermFriendsList     mListView.setAdaptermFriendsAdapter     SomeStaticClass.addFriendListenerthis      mNeedsToBeUpdated  false      mListUpdateHandler  new Handler     mListUpdateHandler.removeCallbacksmListUpdateTask     mListUpdateHandler.postDelayedmListUpdateTask, 10000    onListenerMethod      updateFriendsList     mFriendsAdapter.updateDataSourcemFriendsList     mFriendsAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged  THIS DOESNT UPDATE THE VIEWS     mNeedsToBeUpdated  true   protected void onResume      mListUpdateTask  new Runnable          public void run              if mNeedsToBeUpdated                   updateFriendsList                 mFriendsAdapter.updateDataSourcemFriendsList                 mFriendsAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged  THIS UPDATES THE VIEWS                 mListsRequireUpdating  false                          mListUpdateHandler.postDelayedmListUpdateTask, 10000                   mListUpdateHandler  new Handler     mListUpdateHandler.removeCallbacksmListUpdateTask     mListUpdateHandler.postmListUpdateTask     super.onResume  codepre  pEDIT Of course it took me almost no time to find the answer once I posted this here...p  pI hate to do it but I put some more effort into looking for an answer and I think I found it thanks to this a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comresourcesarticlespainlessthreading.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comresourcesarticlespainlessthreading.htmla  and this a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidosHandler.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidosHandler.htmlap  pThe solution is painfully simple. It is not possible to change the UI in any other thread but the mainUI thread. Thats why doing it in the callback methods doesnt work. However, creating a Handler in the UI Thread e.g. in the onCreate method connects it to the UI Thread and can be later used to post events to this thread.p  precodemListUpdateHandler  new Handler codepre  pThen, an inner class implementing the Runnable interface is needed where the UI tweaking is done.p  precodeclass UpdateListRunnable implements Runnable          Override         public void run              Log.iLOGTAG, UpdateListRunnable             FriendsActivity.this.updateLists                           codepre  pFinally, in the callback method we post the event with out UpdateListRunnable class to the main thread via the Handlerp  precodeOverride     public void entriesUpdatedCollectionltStringgt entries          Log.iLOGTAG, entriesUpdated         for String entry  entries              Log.iLOGTAG, entry   entry                  mListUpdateHandler.postnew UpdateListRunnable      codepre  pThanks to that the upadteLists method is run in the UI thread and everything works like a charm.p

Negative 8822 pIm a C newb struggling with a homework C problem. It is required that i creat a simple program that writes a struture type to a file and then reads the file recovering the data inserted previously. I got these two parts working. p  pThere is another funcionality that is required, that basically asks to replace a char type in the strutures previously entered in the file with another value. The desired effect is that it has a initial 0 value that enables that item to be showed, and when replaced with another vaalue, it isnt showed anymore.p  pIf anyone would be so kind to take a look at this to help me sort it out, Id be really thankful.p  pBTW, I emhaveem read other questions in SO regarding these kind of topics, and they all followed a replace the output file logic as far as I can tell.

Negative 8822 pIm working to design job estimation software for my familys home improvement business and have a bit of a conundrum about how to best organize my data.  There will, of course, be a db table for jobs that stores the job name, address, description, etc. p  pEach job has a series of measurements associated with it that will go on to be used to generate an estimate sent to the prospective customer and a loadout sheet used to determine what materials to take to the job site.p  pMy problem is that the measurements arent all consistent.  Heres a bit of code I put together to test the concept  notice that some measurements require multiple arrays see gutters amp shutters, and that many items require more than the standard keys quantity, unitofmeasure, description, price.p  pIts no secret that Im no coding whiz, but Im here to learn.

Negative 8822 pI have 2 versions of an app, free and paid, but have been maintaining the code separately. Ive finally moved the code into a library referenced by both to make maintaining the code easier.p  pI found that changing the codeAppwidgetProvidercode caused the launcher to delete any existing widgets, so I moved those classes back out of the library to keep the provider the same so users dont have to recreate their widgets. The launcher no longer deletes the widgets, but instead, they simply dont appear after updating.p  pIf I call codeAppWidgetManager.getAppWidgetIdscode for the componentname, as its always been, the appwidgetid is still there. The appwidgetprovider and service still get called to update the widget, and codedatasystemappwidgets.xmlcode still shows the widget, but the launcher never displays it.p  pIts not that its invisible, as long pressing in the widget location brings up the wallpaper chooser. I can create new widgets just fine, but I dont want to frustrate users by asking them to recreate their widgets. The logs dont show any errors thrown by the launcher or codeAppwidgetServicecode.p  pAny ideas why the widget stops rendering after updating Its somehow related to moving most of the code into a separate library. Thanksp  pEdit Im testing on an emulator, api level 15, stock launcherp

Negative 8822 pOk so Im learning C.NET and have thus far stuck to winforms, but WPF seemed suitable for this project.p  pI have a WrapPanel that displays an array of images.

By multiplying by the iteration, I always move wrapPanel1 up by 1 row.p  pimgLayout starts the process all over again, as each time I run through all the pages I need to check if there are any new images, and knock any old ones off the end. This is all handled in imgLayout.p  pI update the labels just so I can keep an eye on it while debugging, they return exactly the values Id expect.p  pAs you might have gathered from the question title, my problem is that with every iteration of my t2elapsed, the interval seems to increase. If I set the interval to 10ms just to observe its behaviour, it would appear that the delay increases exponentially. After 30s the delay is about 25s, up from 0.1 observed at first. RAM usage slowly climbs too which suggests to me that some resources arent being disposed of when the loop restarts, not sure if that is the cause or a separate problem.p  pHope someone can help If Ive done something stupid, just tell me, Im still learningp  pMany thanksp  pUPDATEp  pOk so I think its something to do with the p  precodewrapPanel1.Children.Clear  codepre  pline. I removed it and just let it fill up and up and I get no delay, but this obviously isnt the final solution. Wherever I put that line it reproduces the problem.p  pUPDATE strong2strongp  pWell I feel rather dumb now. Earlier in the imgLayout method where the timer is started I was usingp  precodet2.Interval  new TimeSpan0, 0, 0, 0, 5000 t2.Tick  new EventHandlert2Tick t2.Start codepre  pI was stupidly declaring the event handler every time the loop restarted. I set it in the WindowLoaded method instead and its working exactly as one would expect now, just tidied it up a bit and implemented a way of scrolling one whole page at a time instead of just one row.p

Negative 8822 pSo Im trying to update my RadRadialGauge.  It will display data using an animated Needle that is being retrieved on a realtime basis.  I have a RadChartView that currently works by using codeTimeStampcode and codeValuecode properties to draw the Chart.  When I add a chart, sometimes I might want to add a few based on the variable Im watching.  For instance, if I want to watch Motor Speed and Output Frequency, I have to add multiple vertical axes.  Part of my code to handle the data binding for the RadChartView is herep  precodevar lineSeries  new LineSeries lineSeries.CategoryBinding      new PropertyNameDataPointBinding  PropertyName  TimeStamp  lineSeries.ValueBinding      new PropertyNameDataPointBinding  PropertyName  Value  lineSeries.ItemsSource  chart.Chart as GuiAnalogQueue.Records codepre  pThe rest of the code is just appearance handling, and then at the end I add the LineSeries to my RadChartView.  p  pNow, Im trying to port this code, in a way, over to RadGauge.  Im not sure how to bind the values to the Needle so the needle moves when the Value changes.br In the XAML Ive tried codeValueBinding Valuecode Ive tried adding binding to the codeValueSourcecode varible.  Also I have done codeneedle.Value  chart.Chart.Valuecodep  pI cant figure it out, so any help is appreciated.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThis is what Im trying to accomplish.  My codeRecordscode collection has two properties, codeValuecode and codeTimeStampcode.  Im trying to bind my codeValuecode in the codeRecordscode to the codeneedlecode Value. This is my approach to do it programmaticallyp  precodepublic void InitializeChartsChartsVM charts, Theme theme      DataContext  charts     foreach cVM chart in charts.Charts              Binding value  new Binding         value.Source  chart.Chart as GuiAnalogQueue.Records         value.Path  new PropertyPathValue         needle.SetBindingNeedle.ValueProperty, value        codepre  pHowever, when I do this, it is not changing the codeneedle.Valuecode at all.  My codeRecordscode is the collection that uses NotifyPropertyChangedRecords, so I would expect my needle to change everytime Records is changed.  p  pAs you see in my original post, those three lines take care of binding the variables to ChartView charts, however I cant get the RadGauge to work.p

Negative 8822 pA little bit of context  Im creating a pocketsphinx application for android, using jsgf grammars though the problem persists with fsg grammars as well. My code is based on the pocketsphinx a hrefhttpcmusphinx.sourceforge.net201105buildingpocketsphinxonandroid relnofollowdemo for androida. p  pPocketsphinx is producing a bizarre issue where the accuracy appears to be degrading after only a couple of queries to the engine. The first query has near perfect accuracy  it can recognize relatively complicated and convoluted phrases without difficulty. However the second, and third recognitions can barely pick up a two syllable word, and by the fourth query to the engine, it simply fails to generate a hypothesis. p  pIm not quite sure whats causing the problem, the original demo appeared to work fine, and I have hardly altered the configuration of the speech engine, other than adding a grammar. Anyway, has anyone else ever experienced something like this, or even have a suggestion as to what I could try to remedy this p  pThanks p
Negative 8822 pThere are a few transports available for OpenEJB 4.0.0p  ol liejbdli liejbdsli lihttpejbdli ol  pWhich one is lighter on the networkp  pWhich one is fasterp  pAre there any pros and cons of choosing any one of thenp  pOur application as around 450 clients talking to remote EJBs on a OpenEJB 4.0.0 container. All in a local LAN but using cascading switches with some redundancy.p  pUpdatep  pThis question is not related to another one on timeouts. We dont have any timeouts or application problems that we could identify. The application works very well when we have a limited number of clients, but when we try it with hundreds we are facing what seems to be network errors the server logs show recurring IoExpcetion unkown byte received. Since CORBA ORBs has been reported to have broadcast problems, we were suspecting it might be a RMI over IIOP kind of problem. We are going to try other protocol options to compare against our current set up.p  pUpdate 2012oct08p  pwe have run hundreds of tests now, with 450 clients in a LAN. There is no one size fits all answer. If we have very few clients, EJBD is faster. If we have hundreds of clients, EJBD stops working it seems to cause switch saturation. With hundreds of clients, httpejbd still works it seems related to the fact that each remote call creates a short duration http request.p

Negative 8822 pIf I am trying to initialize a NSLocale with a certain locale identifier, how can I tell if it is a legit identifier  No matter what identifier I pass in, even a garbage one, NSLocale still gets initialized to something.p  pFor example, if you pass in arNO, a locale with language arabic and a invalid country code of NO, the NSLocale object that I get seems legitimate.  For example, if I call code[NSCalendar firstWeekday]code from a calendar with that locale, it will return Monday.  My question, is where is that coming from  Does iOS fall back to another locale in case it cant use the given identifier  I would think it would fall back to the base ar, but ar firstWeekday is Saturday, so that is not the case.p  pNote I know that the identifiers are specificed by ISO BCP 47 specifications and I know about the code[NSLocale availableLocaleIdentifiers]code function, but that doesnt really help me because if I use an identifier not in that list, I still get a NSLocale.p  pAnyone have any thoughts  Thanks in advancep

Negative 8822 pIve been attempting to undistort imagery from a fisheye camera if its relevant, Im using a GoPro using OpenCVs camera calibration suite. Ive got most of the process working and can generate undistorted images. However, when using remap, the undistorted image is the valid rectangle  in other words, the image returned is a cropped version of the original to avoid the curved black borders that are inherent in undistorted frames.p  pI have attempted to use getOptimalNewCameraMatrix to correct the situation, with very strange results. Im hoping one of you can shed some light on my problems.p  pI currently calibrate the camera as followsp  precodedouble error  calibrateCameraworldPoints, sensorPoints, processsize, cameraMatrix, distCoeffs, rvecs, tvecs, calibrationflags codepre  pwhich generates the cameraMatrix I need. This part works I think, because if I run this through initUndistortRectifyMap followed by remap, I get a valid image back. However, Im looking for the full image, so the next thing I do is try to correct my cameraMatrix as followsp  precodeint alpha  1 cameraMatrixcorr  getOptimalNewCameraMatrixcameraMatrix, distCoeffs, image.size, alpha codepre  pThen, I generate the X and Y maps for remap, as follows this is borrowed directly from the OpenCV 2.0 Cookbook, so Im fairly confident it works too.p  precodeinitUndistortRectifyMap     cameraMatrixcorr,   computed camera matrix     distCoeffs,  computed distortion matrix     Mat,  optional rectification none     Mat,  camera matrix to generate undistorted     image.size,   size of undistorted     CV32FC1,       type of output map     map1, map2    the x and y mapping functions codepre  pFinally, I remap my imagep  precode Apply mapping functions remapimage, undistorted, map1, map2, INTERLINEAR codepre  pHere are my results so far. If I use alpha  0 no change to the matrix, I get reasonable though cropped results.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfmSs7.jpg altImage alpha  1p  pIf I use alpha  1, which I think should give me an image with every original pixel mapped to the new image, I get the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9AblJ.jpg altImagealpha  0p  pSo, my question is this What am I doing wrong, and why can I not just get an uncropped, undistorted image out of the calibrationp  pThanks all for putting up with me, this is my first question here, but I tried to be as complete as possible. Let me know if I screwed up somehowp

Negative 8822 pI know the GAE scheduler is the subject of much scrutiny and attention.  I also know it is critical to the performance of my application.  I have spent the last week optimising and analysing my application.p  pI also understand that the scheduler is designed to work across the gamut of application sizes, and the algorithm may not be optimised for my relatively smaller scale application, in terms of concurrent users.p  pI believe the following description of pending latency is wrong, which leads to unavoidable delaysp  blockquote   pThe Pending Latency slider controls how long requests spend in the   pending queue before being served by an Instance of the default   version of your application. If the minimum pending latency is high   App Engine will allow requests to wait rather than start new Instances   to process them. This can reduce the number of instance hours your   application uses, but can result in more uservisible latency.p blockquote  pHow can it possibly be the case that with a pending latency of 15 seconds, and 2 idle instances, when I execute 10 requests in serial, all taking 13 seconds with mutlithreading enabled, that it spins up new instances  p  pWhy do I care  I could just put all my intialisation in my warmup code  Wrong.  I am using GAEJ with JDO.  It seems that the FIRST time EACH INSTANCE hits an ENTITY TYPE the  very FIRST time it incurs a validation overhead of a few seconds.  Most of the time you wont even know this is happening unless you set your JDO logging to INFO level.p  pstrongMy question is the followingstrongp  pstrongHas anyone else experienced the following situation relating to scheduler behaviour and its interaction with DS initialisation, and if so, can you suggest a solution so that I may avoid incurring such delaysstrongp  pSpecifically, the situation isp  ul liWith JDO  Each time a new instance touches an entity type for the first time it incurs an initialisation overhead if you are in doubt set your JDO logging level to INFO.  This overhead is of the order of 23 secsli liThe increased latency as a result of this overhead, coupled with the fact that the scheduler clearly ignores the Pending Latency parameters means it is more likely to spin up a new instance than calculate that existing instances can handle the request.li libecause the new request is being handled by a new instance the initialisation overhead described above is REPEATED.  Thus the vicious circle is perpetuated.li ul  pNote that I have already considered the following remediesp  ol limigrate to hibernate or similar  a huge undertaking and unclear if it will solve problems.li limodify my application architecture to use Backends to deliver all DB functionality as at least I can control how many I have running etc.li liperhaps there is some JDO config I am missing that will simply avoid the abovementioned overheadli ol

Negative 8822 pIm building a bunch of forms that have labels and corresponding fields input element or more complex elements. p  pLabels go on the left, fields go on the right. Labels in a given form should all be a specific width so that the fields all line up vertically.p  pThere are two ways maybe more of achieving thisp  ol lipemstrongRowsemstrong Float each label and each field left. Put each label and field in a fieldrow divcontainer. Set label width to some specific number. With this approach labels on different forms will have different widths, because theyll depend on the width of the text in the longest label.pli lipemstrongColumnsemstrong Put all labels in one divcontainer thats floated left, put all fields in another floated left container with paddingleft set. This way the labels and even the label container dont need to have their widths set, because the column layout and the paddingleft will uniformly take care of vertically lining up all the fields.pli ol  pSo approach 2 seems to be easier to implement because the widths dont need to be set all the time, but I think its also less object oriented, because a label and a field that goes with that label are not grouped together, as they are in approach 1. Also, if building forms dynamically, approach 2 doesnt work as well with functions like codeaddRowlabel, fieldcode, since it would have to know about the label and the field containers, instead of just creatingadding one fieldrow element.p  pWhich approach do you think is better Is there another, better approach than these twop

Negative 8822 pWe are successfully using the Jenkins CI server on Windows 7. It mainly does compiles using CodeWarrior. Using the Win32OLE library in Perl to automate the IDE, I recently added a new Unit Test job that compiles then also starts the debugger, runs a test thread on target hardware, then stops. It works fine when I start it from a command line under my user name, however when Jenkins starts the same task the IDE consumes all the CPU and never ends. Under the Windows Task Manager I see the IDE running as a SYSTEM user. I suspect theres a new popup message I havent accounted for in my OLE automation, but cant see it because its a background task now.p  pIs there a tool or technique to help debug windows that Jenkins starts as a system user but arent visiblep

AppDomainSetup domaininfo  new AppDomainSetup   Configure domaininfo.ApplicationName  PluginName domaininfo.ApplicationBase  MyPath domaininfo.PrivateBinPath  MyPath domaininfo.LoaderOptimization  LoaderOptimization.MultiDomain domaininfo.DisallowApplicationBaseProbing  false domaininfo.DisallowBindingRedirects  false domaininfo.DisallowCodeDownload  false domaininfo.DisallowPublisherPolicy  false  System.Security.Policy.Evidence adevidence  AppDomain.CurrentDomain.Evidence  Create the new application domain using setup information. domain  AppDomain.CreateDomainPluginName  Domain, adevidence, domaininfo  addin  token.ActivateltIOpenSourceAutomationAddInv2gtdomain codepre  pThis method allows me to tell each addin to run in a new app domain and I can specify where to look for additional assemblies.  This is important because each addin is in its own subdirectory and needs to look in the same directory as the host to load other assemblies.  The problem with this method is if an addin has an unhandled exception it will cause the host to crash since it is running in the same process.p  precodeAddInProcess process process  new AddInProcessPlatform.AnyCpu  addin  token.ActivateltIOpenSourceAutomationAddInv2gtprocess,AddInSecurityLevel.FullTrust codepre  pThis method loads each addin into its own process so it an individual addin crashes it doesnt affect the host.  The problem with this is I havent been able to figure out if it is possible to tell the addins where to look for additional assemblies.  They will only look in their directory instead of the hosts directory.p  pWhat is the best way to use MAF in order to accomplish what I am looking for  I need to be able to load my addins is such a way to separate them from the host because I am not writing the addins.  I dont have control over their code so I need to be sure they wont crash the host. I also need to be to able to specify where the addins should load assemblies from since they will be in their own subdirectory and need to load an assembly from the host directory.  I would also prefer to not use the GAC if possible.p

Negative 8822 pstrongSummarystrong How does the compiler statically determine the size of a C class during compilationp  pstrongDetailsstrong p  pIm trying to understand what the rules are for determining how much memory a class will use, and also how the memory will be aligned.p  pFor example the following code declares 4 classes.  The first 2 are each 16 bytes.  But the 3 is 48 bytes, even though it contains the same data members as the first 2.  While the fourth class has the same data members as the third, just in a different order, but it is 32 bytes.p  precodeinclude ltxmmintrin.hgt include ltstdio.hgt  class TestClass1    m128i vect   class TestClass2    char buf[8]   char buf2[8]   class TestClass3    char buf[8]   m128i vect   char buf2[8]   class TestClass4    char buf[8]   char buf2[8]   m128i vect    TestClass1 ptr1 TestClass2 ptr2 TestClass3 ptr3 TestClass4 ptr4 int main    ptr1  new TestClass1   ptr2  new TestClass2   ptr3  new TestClass3   ptr4  new TestClass4   printfsizeof TestClass1 is lut TestClass2 is lut TestClass3 is lut TestClass4 is lun, sizeofptr1, sizeofptr2, sizeofptr3, sizeofptr4   return 0  codepre  pI know that the answer has something to do with alignment of the data members of the class.  But I am trying to understand exactly what these rules are and how they get applied during the compilation steps because I have a class that has a codem128icode data member, but the data member is not 16byte aligned and this results in a segfault when the compiler generates code using codemovapscode to access the data.p

Negative 8822 pHeres my scenario  the app starts with an Activity A which is the main launching point. There are various other activity that are launched from A, say B amp C. Going from A to B should be reversible pressing back actually returning, so every I need A on the activity stack, same for A  C and back. All that works just fine by default. p  pNow heres where it gets tricky I have another activity, say X, which can be launched from a background process broadcast receiver. When X is launched, it should replace whatever is currently on the screen  that part is no problem. X can then either be dismissed by the user which ends with finish and startActivityA  so I dont have X on the stack. And it can also be finished by the background process broadcast receiver receiving another intent  and it is in the latter case where I have a problem.p  pI still call finish on X and now the following happens Whichever Activity was previously active say A, will show again. That is fine if A showed before X launched, however, if my app was in the background, once X is dismissed I want the state prior to launching X restored so either show the home screen, or show whichever app was running before X was launched. If youre wondering.. why am I interrupting the user  its for a good reason its a telephony app and incoming calls should interrupt.p  pIt seems to be that when I call dismiss on X, the app will return to whatever else is in the activity stack. That is fine if the app was in the foreground when X was launched, but if it wasnt, I want X to be dismissed and whichever app was active to be on top again.p  pHere are the intent flags Im using when launching X FLAGACTIVITYNEWTASK FLAGACTIVITYCLEARTOP FLAGACTIVITYNEWTASKp  pIve already tried FLAGACTIVITYMULTIPLETASK but the results were less than satisfactory if my app was running in the background, this prevents it from coming on top when X is dismissed without user intervention, but then in the app history, itll show X and X should never ever be shown there, plus if the user actually selects it, sure enough it launches X, and thats bad.p  pSo brieflyp  pPhone is in Status S1 X is launched X is dismissed without user interaction by calling finish Phone should return to Status S1p  pCan this be achieved somehowp

Negative 8822 pIm working on upgrading a legacy Rails app from 3.0 to 3.2, and have run into some really baffling behavior from ActiveRecord. I have two very simple modelsp  precodeclass Newsletter lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany newsletterentries    def []key      Weird old code, not related to NewsletterEntry   end     etc. end codepre  pandp  precodeclass NewsletterEntry lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto newsletter     etc. end codepre  pIn my Rails 3.0 branch, this all works fine. But in my Rails 3.2 branch, for whatever reason, calling newsletterentries on a newsletter always comes back empty. Looking through the SQL statements, it quickly became apparent that ActiveRecord is always searching  the newsletterentries table for entries with newsletteridNULL, regardless of the actual primary key of the Newsletter Im handling. Consider the SQL at the end of this console outputp  precodegt newsletter  Newsletter.create title gt Proof of Concept  SQL and irrelevant fields omitted gt ltNewsletter id 13, title Proof of Concept, createdat 20130228 004425, updatedat 20130228 004425gt   gt newsletter.newsletterentries   NewsletterEntry Load 0.4ms  SELECT newsletterentries. FROM newsletterentries WHERE newsletterentries.newsletterid IS NULL gt []  codepre  pAfter a lot of wailing and gnashing of teeth I traced the problem back to the custom [] method on the Newsletter model  remove it and everythings back to normal. That override was a code smell to begin with, and I can resolve the problem easily now that I know the source but the whole affair has left me morbidly curious about the role of [] in ActiveRecord relationships. Can anyone explain to me what exactly went wrong here p

Negative 8822 pI am using joomla 2.5 with an artisteer template, I have written a custom component which displays and sorts a list of products, the products themselves are also a part of the component and are saved in a database. what I am trying to do is set a different body background for specific products or product categories according to an if conditionp  precodeif productcategory  1    ltbody idbackground1gt    ... codepre  pbut the problem is that the codeltbody idsomeIDgtcode is loaded in the template.php before the component is loaded, so even if I set a body background in the component, the background will not change. however, if I delete the body css id decleration from the template.php and leave it as codeltbodygtcode instead of codeltbody idsomeIDgtcode, then the component codeltbody id...gtcode declaration sets the background correctly, but then any other page which is not related to the component has a blank white background.p  pwhat I think I need to do is find a way to set a default background in case a background is not defined elsewhere, or somehow override the current background and make to component load the body background again, I am relativly new to php and css but with a little help and I guidence I think I could find my way  any help would be very much appreciated thanks  p

Negative 8822 pIm working on a parentsub application structure in CFML Railo and Im struggling with extending my persistent ORM CFCs.p  pWhat Id like is for my persistent CFCs to live in the parent application. They would contain the various properties, and a few functions dealing with core functionality.p  pIn my sub app, I would like to extend the ORM CFCs declaring any sub app specific properties, and I would like to be able to add new functions specific to the needs of the sub app, as well as overriding any of the core functions if required, without touching the code in the parent apps CFCs.p  pThe sub app uses its own datasource, so Id expect to see the ORM tables generated in the subs database on application start. If I start the parent app which runs standalone and has its own datasource I can see the tables generated there without issue. If I start the child app however, the tables are not generated in either database.p  pIve tried adding codemappedSuperclasstruecode to the parent CFCs and creating CFCs in the child app that extend the parent CFCs.  Ive also tried adding the parent apps ORM folder to the array of CFCLocation folders in the ORM settings.p  pThe only thing Im able to use as an indication that the ORM is working, is to see whether the tables are generated in the database.

Negative 8822 pI am starting to use unit testing in my projects, and am writing tests that are testing at the methodfunction level.p  pI understand this and it makes sense.p  pBut, what is integration testing From what i read it moves the scope of testing up to test larger features of an application.  p  pThis implies that I write a new test suite to test larger things such as on an ecommerce site checkout functionality, user login functionality, basket functionality.  So here i would have 3 integration tests writtenp  pIs this correct  if not can someone explain what is meant.p  pAlso, does integration test involve the ui web application context here and would employ the likes of selenium to automate.  Or is integration testing still at the code level but tying together difference classes and areas of the code.p

Negative 8822 pI want to understand the best practice for end user authentication in an Android application hosted on AWS.

If the default  bundle file isnt adequate, you can specify an alternate file  using the cacert option. If this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in  the bundle, the certificate verification probably failed due to a  problem with the certificate it might be expired, or the name might  not match the domain name in the URL.

Negative 8822 pI am new to iOS programming and working on an iPhone application to capture video and stream it live through a media server. I got a sample code from a hrefhttpwww.gdcl.co.uk20130220iPhonePause.html relnofollowthis linka. But this code makes the iPhone as an RTSP server and the media server has to pull the stream from iPhone. Even though the present setup is working fine, I want iPhone to push the live stream to the media server as I believe in real time the server wont be trying to get the stream from all the iPhone users. The connection should be other way round to make it work Correct me if I am wrong. Please tell me whats the proper way to do this.

Negative 8822 pI have a table of data with some hoveractivated popups. These popups are simply codedivcode elements with codeposition absolutecode and codedisplay nonecode initially set a few lines of JavaScript then hide or show them based on mouse hovering. A flot line graph is attached to each popup.p  pThis works great and fast, except for one hitch. Flot has a bug which causes the xaxis and yaxis labels to overlap at the lowerleft corner when the graph is part of a popup like this. In short, the solution is to display the containing div before generating the graph.p  pI tried a solution in which I eliminated the initial codedisplay nonecode from the CSS for each popup div. I also eliminated the codebackgroundcolorcode and codebordercode style elements, effectively making these divs invisible. Then some simple jQuery generates the graphs and does the proper CSS styling for these popups setting the backgroundcolor, border, etc.. This works, functionally. The graph labels are now correctly positioned. But its emslowem. It easily triples the loading time of the page, which is unacceptable.p  pSimply adding codedisplay nonecode back into the initial CSS for the popup divs solves all the performance problems. So the jQuery code itself cannot be the bottleneck. But that of course causes the label formatting to be messed up again.p  pDoes anybody know how to overcome this issuep

Negative 8822 pYoure going to have to take a look at a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netqu82Z8 relnofollowstrongthe Fiddlestronga for this onep  pThe element Im having trouble with, codehoverHelpercode, is purposed to show codenextcode no matter what part of the body is hovered but only after the animation completesp  pWhen the animation ends, the floated to take it out of the element flow transparent overlay codehoverHelpercode is given an absurdly high width and height to cover the entire page in order to apply a codehovercode event to display the element codenextcode.p  pMy problem, in essence, is that when the floated element is hovered, it registers the hover and acts as it should, but the other elements are negatively affected. For some reason the browser makes all following elements treat it like an unfloated element even though it never loses codefloatleftcode. This means that the anchor and other succeeding elements are pushed thousands of pixels down, which is unacceptablep  pThe easiest way to see this behavior is to inspect the element and force codehovercode on codeactualHovercode. Then you will see how it treats the floated codehoverHelpercode like an unfloated elementp  pFollowing is my HTML and relevant CSSp  precodeltdiv idhoverHelpergtltdivgt ltdiv idactualHovergtltdivgt lta href idnextgtNextltagt ltdiv classothergtltdivgt  body  overflowhidden maxwidth200px maxheight200px hoverHelper      width0px     height0px     zindex1     positionrelative     floatleft     margintop1000px     marginleft1000px     animation hhAnimation .001s 3s forwards  actualHover      width50px     height50px     backgroundteal     animation yourAnimation 3s linear forwards  next      zindex2     display none  actualHoverhover  next, hoverHelperhover  next, nexthover      displayinlineblock  codepre  pAlso, I originally was using codepositionabsolutecode on the overlay, but that prevented the codenextcode button from being clicked which is also unacceptablep  pI realize what Im doing is unconventional, but to me this makes complete sense.

Negative 8822 pIm coming up with a rather trivial problem, but since Im quite new to python, Im smashing my head to my desk for a while. Hurts. Though I believe thats more a logical thing to solve... First I have to say that Im using the Python SDK for Cinema 4D so I had to change the following code a bit. But here is what I was trying to do and struggling with Im trying to group some polygon selections, which are dynamically generated based on some rules, not that important. Heres how it works the mathematical way  Those selections are based on islands means, that there are several polygons connected. Then, those selections have to be grouped and put into a list that I can work with. Any polygon has its own index, so this one should be rather simple, but like I said before, Im quite struggling there.p  pThe main problem is easy to explain Im trying to access a non existent index in the first loop, resulting in an index out of range error. I tried evaluating the validity first, but no luck. For those who are familiar with Cinema 4D  Python, I will provide some of the original code if anybody wants that. So far, so bad. Heres the simplified and adapted code.p  pedit Forgot to mention that the check which causes the error actually should only check for duplicates, so the current selected number will be skipped since it hal already been processed. This is necessary due to computingheavy calculations.p  pReally hope, anybody can bump me in the right direction and this code makes sense so far. p  pre classlangpython prettyprintoverridecodedef myFunc          sel  [0,1,5,12]  changes with every call of myFunc, for example to [2,8,4,10,9,1], etc.  list alway differs in count of elements, can even be empty, groups are beeing built from these values         all  [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]  the whole set         groups  []  list to store indiceslists into         indices  []  list to store selected indices         count  0  number of groups         tmp  []  temporary list to copy the indices list into before resetting          for i in rangelenall  loop through values             if i not in groups[count]  thats the problematic one this one actually should check whether i is already inside of any list inside the group list, error is simply that Im trying to check a non existent value                 for index, selected in enumeratesel  loop through sel and return actual indices. selected determines, if index is selected. boolean.                     if not selected continue  pretty much selfexplanatory                     indices.appendindex  push selected indices to the list                 tmp  indices[]  clone list                 groups.appendtmp  push the previous generated list to another list to store groups into                 indices  []  emptyreset indiceslist                 count  1  increment count         print groups     debug myFunc codepre  pstrongeditstrongp  pAfter adding a second list which will be filled by codeextendcode, not codeappendcode that acts as counter, everything worked as expected The list will be a basic list, pretty simple p

Negative 8822 pIm trying to send an RSA public key of 2048 bits 256byte to a server. I need to read the data as a byte stream. I dont seem to find a way.p  precodeBIO memBio  BIOnewBIOsmem  ASN1PCTX asn1ASN1PCTXnewuseless unless I know how to use it  BIOsetflagsmemBio, BIOFLAGSWRITE int retEVPPKEYprintprivatememBio,rsaAppKeys,0, asn1   BUFMEM bptr BIOgetmemptrmemBio, ampbptr BIOsetclosememBio, BIONOCLOSE  So BIOfree leaves BUFMEM alone  BIOfreememBio codepre  pIt prints in memory the key in a DER format, with hex bytes formatted as strings, and  between each byte, and a header. I could parse it but i think there must be a better way.  In the docs its written that by using a ASN1PCTX I can fine tune the output, but I cant find any documentation of it.p  pAny idea of a simple way to get the key as raw bytes Thanksp
Negative 8822 pI am prepopulating my Django app with two tables and using a hrefhttpsgithub.comedcrewedjangocsvimport relnofollowcsvimporta, which is great.

There are multiple Testresults per School.p  pThe two models have the class variable psid in common, which I want to use to link them.p  pEx. models.pyp  precodeclass Schoolmodels.Model     psid  models.CharFieldmaxlength5   its in the form of AB001     schoolname  models.CharFieldmaxlength200  class Testresultmodels.Model     psid  models.CharFieldmaxlength5     gradelevel  models.CharFieldmaxlength5     mathresult  models.DecimalFieldmaxdigits13, decimalplaces10     readingresult  models.DecimalFieldmaxdigits13, decimalplaces10 codepre  pMy question is, given that Im importing the data, how do I make sure these two tables are linked by the psid column If I were not prepopulating I would use ForeignKey, however I dont believe that will work here. Likewise, NaturalKeys dont seem like they would necessarily link the two models together with psid as desired.p
Negative 8822 pWe have a rails app on Heroku with the Postgres add on.p  pIn isolation no one query performs out of the norm. However in production some read queries perform very badly.p  pCurrently I can only assume that its the combination of concurrent queries that is causing a slow down. But, how can I prove this and diagnose furtherp  pNewRelic is just telling me that a query is slow. But I know its slow. My hypothesis is not that the queries are too slow, but rather that the db server is under too heavy a load. But are there any tools that would tell me that for surep  pThanksp

Negative 8822 pIm trying to use a pattern similar a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19259946wanteduptodateexampleforjsonpostwithbasicauthusingafnetworking2to this post which describes doing a PUTPOST for RESTful APIa, but for a GET.p  pMy original code looks almost the same, except I used a codeGETcode keyword. I quickly discovered that rather than sending a JSON body, it instead url encodes the parameters. This is not mentioned in the documentation of the codeAFJSONSerializercode class.

Negative 8822 pIve been working for a couple of weeks on an Agda project, glibly ignoring level polymorphism as much as I can.

Otherwise I have omitted them, just using codeSetcode directly. Now I have some client code that explicitly quantifies over levels codeacode and tries to pass some types of the form codeSet acode to my existing code, which is now insufficiently polymorphic. In the example below, codequibblecode represents the client code, and code[][]code and codeListcode are typical of my existing code which just uses codeSetcode.p  precodemodule Temp where  open import Data.List open import Data.Product open import Level open import Relation.Binary   Direct product of binary relations. [][]     Level A B C D  Set  A  B  REL A C   REL B D   C  D  Set    a , b [ R ][ S ] c , d  a R c  b S d   Extend a setoid A,  to List A. data List   Level A  Set   Rel A   Rel List A  where    []  List  [] []      x y  A xs ys  List A  xy  x  y  xsys  List  xs ys  List  x  xs y  ys  quibble  a   Level A  Set a  Rel A   Rel List A  A  quibble   List  x y  x [  ][  ] y codepre  pHere, I can extend the inductive definition of codeListcode with an extra level parameter codeacode so that it can take a type argument of type codeSet acode, but then Im unclear as to how the universes of the input and output relations should change. And then problem spills out to more complex definitions such as code[][]code where Im even less sure how to proceed.p  pHow should I generalise the signatures in the example given, so that codequibblecode compiles Are there general rules I can follow Ive read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15924509typehierarchyinagdarq1thisa.p
Negative 8822 pI am using JDeveloper 11.1.2.3.0 I have implemented afcalenar functionality in my application. My calendar is based in a ViewObject that queries a database table with a big number of records 5001000. Performing the selection through a select query to my database table is very fast, only some ms. The problem is that the time to load of my afcalendar is too long. It requires more than 5 seconds. If I just want to change the month, or the calendar view I have to wait approximately that amount of time. I searched a lot through the net but I found no explanation to this. Can anyone please explain why it takes so long Has anyone ever faced this issuep  pPS I have tested even with JDeveloper 12 and the problem is identically the samep
Negative 8822 pI have been handed an OLD ASP.NET website that I am working on that previously only worked on IE5IE9. I managed to fix it so that it could work in IE11. With the need of a serverside .NET hotfix. p  pNow I am also trying to get the website to work properly in Firefox and Chrome, but unfortunately the decapriated javascript doesnt work as intended and breaks some critical functionality entirely but is something I will work out later. p  pRight now Im trying to get the style sheet to work properly crossbrowser. Id like to touch as little code as possible and not break anything else. From what I can see is that the page that is delivered to the browser is different per browser. See these screenshots.p  pFirefox img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comG0a46.jpg altFirefoxp  pChrome img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJXWhV.jpg altGoogle Chromep  pIE11 img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGMHew.jpg altIE11p  pAs you can see the delivered code is different per browser. I am not sure if it is the browser itself doing this or ASP.NET. Is there a way to enforce a specific method This is the code on the ASP.NET side. Take note it is an ancient website.p  precode    ltdiv idmenuDiv runatservergt       ltaspMenu IDmenu runatserver StaticMenuItemStyleCssClassmenu VisibleFalsegt         ltStaticMenuItemStyle CssClassmenugtltStaticMenuItemStylegt       ltaspMenugt     ltdivgt codepre  pAnd this is the related CSS after trying to get it to display properly in firefox and IE11.p  precode.menu a  paddingleft 40px verticalalign middle width 100px color 0462a5 fontweight bold fontsize 14px textdecoration none paddingtop 7px display block textalign left height 20px color 0462A5 backgroundimage urlImageswebmenu.gif  .menu ahover  color 000 backgroundimage urlImageswebmenuover.gif  codepre  pSo again, how can I get these pages to return the same code or same style for every browser in ASP.NETp

Negative 8822 pI am trying to send a HTTPS request through a proxy which needs preemptive authentication using Apache HttpClient 4.3.1.p  pMy proxy blocks connections for some minutes from my IP when I am not directly authenticating myself in the first request.p  pI had no problems with normal HTTP requests, I just added the ProxyAuthorization header manually to the request.p  pBut when attempting to load a HTTPS page, HttpClient seems to use a HTTP Tunnel so the first request is a CONNECT command and after that my actual request is sent. Using the request.setHeader... method does not affect the headers of the CONNECT request, resulting in a HTTP1.0 407 Proxy Authentication Required response and the closing of my connection. After that, HttpClient again connects, this time adding the ProxyAuthorization header field with my credentials.p  pThe connection succeeds HTTP1.0 200 Connection established and my actual GET request is being executed. BUT when I run my program again after that, Ill get an IOExceptionp  blockquote   pInformation IO exception java.net.SocketException caught when   processing request Connection resetp blockquote  pIn Wireshark I can see, that the proxy is not responding to my CONNECT requests which do not contain credentials anymore.

Negative 8822 pContext I need to develop a block matching algorithm for MR images, Ill use these matches to reduce noise with fancy statistics.p  pI have an image that I divide into a grid. Each grid element is a part of this image and I need to find matches for each element. p  pI compare each element lets call this element X of this grid with the rest of the image or a region around the element for similarity with a normalized crosscorrelation. Note that with the rest of the image I mean the whole continuous image, so not just other grid elements. p  pAfter using this crosscorrelation, I have a set lets call it SX of images that is a match to element X. Some of these might coincide with other grid elements. I then move on to some element Y, and do the same thing, and I find SY.p  pThe problem is that Y might be a match of X, so Y might be an element of SX and therefore X will be an element of SY, or in general any element will have a set of matches, and these sets might overlap.p  pNaively Id just create a matrix that contains the coordinates of all matches for each element, and if it adds a match mXY to SX, it should automatically add X to SY. But then I would first have to check all of the matches so I dont do this twice first when I find the matches for X, and then when I find the matches for Y. Checking this might take a lot of time.p  pI cant seem to wrap my head around this problem and Id like to know if theres a general method to this kind of thing. It all smells like some equivalence class problem, but not really. p  pSummary of my questions is this double work a problem in the first place If so, is there an efficient algorithm that matches parts of an image which itself, while avoiding double work p
Negative 8822 pThanks for taking the time to help me. Were building similar site like Delivery.com, grubhub and seamless.com. Customers order food from restaurants. Restaurants receive orders by email and fax. They call our phone number, enter a code and that confirms that the order was received successfully by them. What do I need to register that confirmation on the backend in my db to show that the order has been confirmed I am not a tech person as you can tell. Is Twilio a valid option using their api with a WPF, can they call, enter the code and that will be converted into some script on our server to register the confirmation if not, any other services or scripts I need to buildp

Negative 8822 pImagine we have some parent container. We add children to it, one by one. Children widgets are placed according to some CSS may be as block elements, may be as inline elements.p  pA question is Can we calculate the supposed parent height and width BEFORE adding next child and manage to insert SHOW MORE widget instead of adding next childp  pI tried to add ResizeEvent handler to my container. It catches the event, but only at the very moment when child widget is added, but CSS rules are not applied yet That means that ResizeEvent is caught when all the children widgets are placed one on top of another as block elements, but in fact they should be placed as inline elements. After ResizeEvent Handler runs CSS rules are applied and childwidgets are reordered as inline elements, but this is not causing new ResizeEvents to parent container, which height is small again..p  pSo in fact I want to catch the moment of resizing of my parent container before it happens.. a kind of a if you add this child  parent needs resize or if you add this child  parent size is bigger than ... px trigger. p  pSo is it possible to solve this taskp

Basically the shared memory serves as kind of heap, I have only one array inside in which Im storing keys with meaningless values as hashed index, I just check Ah, its there already. Now my problem is that array can get quite big at times, but it doesnt always. I dont want to reserve a huge amount of memory I donT usually need, but rather resize dynamically.p  pI have registered an error handler that converts errors into codeErrorExceptioncodes, so I can codecatchcode the error thrown by codeshmputvarcode when the memory is to small to store the array  but unfortunatly PHP clears the segment when data doesnt fit in there, so all other data is lost, too. This isnt an option therefore.p  pBecause of this, I need a way to predict the size Ill need to store the data. a hrefhttpwww.php.netmanualenfunction.shmattach.php85085 relnofollowOne of the comments to codeshmattachcode at php.neta states that PHP appends an header of codePHPINTSIZE  4  8codebytes length, and one variable needs codestrlenserializefoo  4  PHPINTSIZE  4code emI have simplified the expression given in the comment, its equal to mine but was blown up unecessarilyembr While the header size seems to be correct any memory smaller than 24 byte results in an error at creation, so 24 bytes seems to be the size of the header PHP puts in there, the size of each variable entry doesnt seem to hold true anymore in recent versions of PHPbr   I could store 1 in a shared memory segment with a size of code24  strlenserialize1  3  PHPINTSIZE  4code byte note the strong3strong in there instead of strong4strong,br   I couldn NOT store 999 in one sized code24  strlenserialize999  4  PHPINTSIZE  4codep  pDoes anyone know a way to predict how much memory is needed to store any data in shared memory using the shm functions or has some reference on how shm stores the variables I read the whole contets using shmop functions and printed them, but since its binary data its not reverseengineerable in reasonable timep  pI will provide code samples as needed, Im just not sure what parts will get relevant  ping me if you want to see any working samples, I have tried much so I have samples ready for most casesp  hr  pstrong[Update]strong My C is pretty bad, so I odnt get far looking at the source a hrefhttpfossies.orgdoxphp5.2.17sysvshm8csource.html relnofollowsysvshm.ca and a hrefhttpfossies.orgdoxphp5.2.17phpsysvshm8hsource.html relnofollowphpsysvshm.ha, but I already found one issue with the solution that was suggested at php.net While I could simplify the complex formula there to what I have included here which was taken from the C sourcecode basically, this is NOT possible with the original one, as there are typecasts and no floating point math. The formula divides by codesizeoflongcode and multiplies with it again  which is useless in PHP but does round to multiples of codesizeoflongcode on C. SO I need to correct that in PHP first. Still, this is not everything, as Tests showed that I could store some values in even less memory than returned by the formula see above.p

Obviously showing and hiding them with jQuery would be trivial, but thats not what Im after.p  pI have two ideas, p  p1 trigger custom events from my router that removes all views and sends events that could be listened for in all views triggering a close method  and a main App view that then instantiates a specific view  ie p  precodeApp.Router  Backbone.Router.extend     routes            index,         addnew  addNew,         contactsid  singleContact,         contactsidedit  editContact     ,      index function          vent.triggercontactRcloseAll         vent.triggercontactRindex     ,      addNew function           vent.triggercontactRcloseAll         vent.triggercontactRaddNew     ,      singleContact functionid           vent.triggercontactRcloseAll         vent.triggercontactRsingleContact, id     ,      editContact functionid           vent.triggercontactRcloseAll         vent.triggercontactReditContact, id     ,   codepre  pnb  vent is extending the backbone events obj so I can pub  sub p  p2 or would  could  should I send a close all event and create an instance of the view in the router p  pNote Im looking to achieve this without delving into additional libraries or frameworks like marionette etc.p

Negative 8822 pSo I have searched everywhere to try and find an answer to my question but everyone seems to be OK with the way it selects cells by default in a box.p  pI am working on a hex editor and currently have SelectionMode set to default RowHeaderSelect and MultiSelect is set to true. My issue is that when you click on a cell and drag select, it selects cells in a box shape like excel. This is not how I need it to select cells. p  pI currently got around this by handling the following events, CellMouseDown, CellMouseEnter, CellMouseUp, amp MouseUp. This gives me the selection I am looking for but the default box selection style is still there during drag selection. p  pThis code sample is happening on CellMouseUp and is providing the selection style I am looking for. The first photo is what my selection looks like after the code below is ran CellMouseUp. The second picture is what happens as your dragging code below is ran on CellMouseEnter also to custom select while dragging but its producing this visual bug of unselecting an entire  column because its out of the default selection box style excel style.p  pEdit To clarify selection works after mouse up and mouse down occur   dgvMainBinary.ClearSelection then code below   This is a visual bug that is happening during dragging. Only thing I can think of is the default box selection mode running after my CellMouseEnter event.p  pAny help would be appreciated, Thanks. p  precode        for int row  startY row lt endY row                      int startColumn  0             int endColumn  15             if row  startY                              startColumn  startX                 if startY  endY                     endColumn  endX                          else if row  endY                              endColumn  endX lt 16endX15                          for int column  startColumn column lt endColumn column                              dgvMainBinary.Rows[row].Cells[column].Selected  true                       codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfq4E2.png altimage1p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTrUKW.png altimage2p

Negative 8822 pin my wordpress 3.9.0 installation, I have some problems regarding the formatting of the text the admin users enter. The default behavior is that it removes codeltpgtcode tags and codeltbrgtcode tags when switching betweeen HTML and text mode. I found some old questions that hinted to install the Tinymce advanced plugin, which I did.p  pSo, at this point, the text enters the database exactly I verified this in phpmyadmin as I want it. If it has double codeltbrgtcode, it keeps the double codeltbrgtcode. Also, when the text is displayed to a visitor, the double codeltbrgtcode stays a double codeltbrgtcode.p  pHowever, when I reload the text into the editor, every double codeltbrgtcode is converted to a codeltpgtcode tag. This is extermely annoying. I tried numerous plugins, also changed the tinymce configuration file with the coderemovelinebreakscode , codeconvertnewlinestobrscode and coderemoveredundantbrs optionscode to no avail.p  pI am quite sure wordpress sends the database content through some filters, however I have no idea which ones they are.

Negative 8822 pIm working on an Add In for Microsoft Excel in Visual Studio that records the balances for each account or Worksheet and saves them to a userspecified file. The ability to press a button and select a destination to save your work is an essential skill for any programmer, so Im perplexed as to why there is so little information on how to do it. The closest thing I found was a tutorial on MSDN that saves a button icon image.p  pThe code Im currently using is as followsp  precodeStringBuilder sb  new StringBuilder  if ThisAddIn.createdbudget      string budget  Budget    ThisAddIn.blake.budget      SaveFileDialog savebudget  new SaveFileDialog     savebudget.Filter  Data files .dat.datAll files ..     savebudget.Title  Save Budget     savebudget.ShowDialog      if savebudget.FileName                using StreamWriter sr  new StreamWritersavebudget.OpenFile                      sb.AppendLinebudget                 else      MessageBox.ShowControl disabled.  Budget does not yet exist.  codepre  pMy objective is to allow the user to designate a file path via codeSaveFileDialogcode and save a new .dat or .txt.

Something likep  precodesr.WriteLineAccount1.Name   Balance    Account1.Balance sr.WriteLineAccount2.Name   Balance    Account2.Balance etc... codepre  pI know this sounds complicated.  I have no problem saving data if Im using a predetermined file path, but thats not very helpful.  What I need to know is how to properly write files using codeSaveFileDialogcode.p

Negative 8822 pLets say I have a binary search tree with N nodes. Or an quad tree, or octtree, if these make any difference.p  pThen lets say I run an algorithm which changes all the keys in the tree. It seems to be complicated to move stuff around.

That is, a complete rebuild.p  pWhat time complexity can I expect to get for doing this kind of rebuilding There are codeNcode nodes and each insertion takes codelog Ncode time, but I cant wrap my head around what will happen as the tree grows.p
Negative 8822 pI have an array 3, 8, 10, 6, 15, 20, 16, 4, 18, 9.

My problem is that since every element in the array that is left of 15 cant be swapped over since it is less than 15 but there are elements on the right that need to be swapped. I think Im doing it wrong where I need to swap the elements with the pivot.p

Negative 8822 pI am working hierarchical data, as in the tree structure. i want to know what is the best way to store them in database.p  pI started with adjacency list, in MySQL. But the performance seems to dip as the data is increasing. I have around 20,000 rows stored in a MySQL table with parent child relationship and will increase in future. Fetching data is taking very long time as I have to write many self joins depending upon the depth of the tree. p  pSo I was searching for best way to store this kind of data. In once place I found Nested Sets is better way than adjacency lists. Then I was advised to look upon NoSQL, if that would solve my problem. So I am confused now whether to remain in SQL or go into No SQL or if there is any other best way to handle this kind of data.p  pSo can anyone suggest me what is the best wayp
Negative 8822 pI have implemented a poormanssearchbox using a combobox. The search expression is typed into the textfield and the user press enter. Then the search expression is added to the combo model, this is caught in the eventhandler which then runs the search, empties the combo list and populates it with the searchresults instead. However, the user then need to open the combo list manually by pressing the little downarrow to see the result. Itd be nice to open the list automatically, but I havent found out how to do that. Does anyone knowp  pAlso the search should be performed each time the user presses a key, and not only after enter is pressed.p

Negative 8822 pOk, ill try to keep this quick and to the point.p  pIn C Winforms, I have a GUI window which displays a datagridview and a textbox. Basically what I want to do is, when either the Up Arrow key or Down arrow key is pressed, to send this input straight to the datagridview in order to move up and down through the list. If any other key is pressed, I want to send this input to my textbox. p  pIve tried overwriting the ProcessCmdKey method and setting focus based on the keyData keycode, but what happens is the first key press will only set the control focus, then, the 2nd key press will actually work on the focused control. Id like the input to work immediately without that one key delay.p  pExtra detailsp  pThe GUI class is a generic class. p  pHope this makes sense I will edit if more details are needed Thank youp
Negative 8822 pMy ASP.NET MVC 5 application is using my local IIS Windows 7 which worked great until I had to start using the Microsoft.SqlServer.Types NuGet package. Because the package has native assemblies they have to be specialty loaded at runtime.p  pThe problem Im running into though is that after I rebuild the application and access it through the browser IIS loads and locks the native assemblies. If I make the change and rebuild again, Visual Studio fails and says the assemblies are locked by another process, IIS.

Negative 8822 pI am trying to find a best or common practice for creating a table of buttons from a database list.p  pFor my use I am creating more of a Point of Sale type screen.

Those buttons would add the items to, lets call it, a ticket.p  pThe solutions I found were few. I am also trying to code this so others can pick it up fairly quickly. I am extremely rusty and only code once in a while. So I try to follow common ways of doing it. I had some ideas but the code becomes hard to read, mostly because of me.p  pI saw the below link but was not sure if a ListBox was a good container for this. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2766875dynamicfillingwrappanelbuttonsfromdbsettingtheeventhandlersDynamic filling WrapPanel buttons from DB, setting the event handlersap  pI am sure a wrappenel is what I would have to use, but do I put it in a container or use it directly. Do I put it in Xaml or code it all, for issues like spacing between buttons I think I am overthinking it and need to skip for a little bit.p  pThank you,p

Instead, I get a box with no image.p  pNow, the image is in my public folder so if I browse to publicimagesdefault.jpg I do see my cat image, but Id rather serve images within my apiv1... route.p  precodeRoutegetimagesimageName, functionimageName     img  publicimages . imageName      return img     echo img . nn     ifFileexistsimg           return true          return Responsemakeimg, 200, arraycontenttype gt imagejpg          return Responsedownloadimg, imageName          Set headers         headerCacheControl public         headerContentDescription File Transfer         headerContentDisposition inline filename.imageName.         headerContentType imagejpg         headerContentTransferEncoding binary         stream the file out         readfileimg         exit      else          return false          return img      return Fileexistsimg      return FileisFileimages . imageName      return imageName      ifFileisFileimages  imageName       return Responsemakeimages  imageName, 200, arraycontenttype gt imagejpg        codepre

Negative 8822 pI was wondering about why and when we need a data warehouse, I mean the main goal of data warehouse is to provide a reporting from multidimentional view, but in some case there is a way to build a report using DBMS, it can produce a report from multidimentional view, about the size of the database, the size can be made incrementally, and about integration DBMS also can make integration from many data source and if they have a different key from many data source, dbms can fix it althought were not using data warehouse, from the peformance side, how much time it will take to generate a report from operational data store and generate a report from a data warehouse, are the processing time is having a big gapp  pSorry for bad english and weird question, Im still learning about data warehouse.p

I have access to the entire meaningful data area all cells containing names by the name entries and all meaningful entries in a given row by the name row.p  pIn my example above, strongallstrong codeTimcode and codeLucycode entries should be highlighted because they have duplicates in other rows. codePetecode, codeOscarcode and codeAnnacode are unique, so theyre not highlighted. codeFrankcode, while having duplicates, only has them in the same row, no other row contains codeFrankcode, so he should not be highlighted.

Negative 8822 pI am trying to get Gurobi to call back after an optimal solution is found using the Java interface.  p  pBackground I am working on an approach which requires 1 finding a very good solution and then 2 adding a lazy constraint to the problem. A good solution has to be found first since identifying a reasonable new lazy constraint requires a good solution in my case.p  pIn general, this is not a problem since Gurobi calls back with MIP, MIPSOL etc. I can then check the gap of the current solution and decide on adding the next lazy constraint.  p  pHowever, when looking for a very good solution, Gurobi sometimes finds an optimal solution for instance after cutting nodes off. In this case, there is no additional MIP, MIPSOL or any other usable callback which would me allow to add an additional lazy constraint.p  pI have already found that cutoffs can be identified using MIPNODESTATUS. I have however not yet found a way to check if this cutoff leads to the currently solution being proven optimal.p  pDoes anybody know to identify this case and still add a lazy constraintp

The program calculates fn  1  2  3...  n valid when n  0p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  const unsigned int MAXNUM  92681 Max input that will avoid int overflow later on  unsigned int sumunsigned int x   int mainint argc, char argv[]        unsigned int input  atoiargv[1]       if input lt 0  input gt MAXNUM          printfInvalid input Input must be less than 92682n         exit0 If input gt MAXNUM, quit program           unsigned int result  suminput      printfSum to d  dn, input, result      return 0   unsigned int sumunsigned int x      unsigned int sum  0     unsigned int y     for y  0 y lt x y          sum  y         printfCurrent sumtun,sum          return sum  codepre  pThe first thing I began to notice was integer overflow when fn  2147483648  aka the maximum value for a signed int.p  pI found the maximum values mathematically by hand for which the results generated by my program would be valid e.g. before integer overflow to be 65535 for signed ints and 92681 for unsigned ints.p  pRunning the program for signed ints produced the expected results  at 65535 the very large positive number became a very large negative number as the integer overflowed.p  pI then went through and changed every int to unsigned int. Despite this integer overflow occurs as if the ints were signed and not unsigned. p  pMy question is a Why is this b How can I make it so that my answer can use the whole range of unsigned int i.e. 0 through to 232  1 as I dont need negative values.p  pThanks very much p

Negative 8822 pI have two hive tables t1 and t2 that I would like to compare. The second table has 5 additional columns that are not in the first table. Other than the five disjoint fields, the two tables should be identical. I am trying to write a query to check this. Here is what I have so farp  precodeSELECT  FROM t1  UNION ALL select  from t2 GROUP BY somevalue HAVING count  2 codepre  pIf the tables are identical, this should return 0 records. However, since the second table contains 5 extra fields, I need to change the second select statement to reflect this. There are almost 60 column names so I would really hate to write it like thisp  precodeSELECT  FROM t1  UNION ALL select field1, field2, field3,...,fieldn from t2 GROUP BY somevalue HAVING count  2 codepre  pI have looked around and I know there is no codeselect  EXCEPTcode syntax, but is there a way to do this query without having to explicity name each column that I want included in the final resultp
Negative 8822 pI am using Indy IDFTP to make a directory.  I need to find a reliable way to determine if a directory exists and if it does not exist, to call MakeDir.

How can I determine if a directory exists and create the directory if it does not exist  p  precode Check to see if the publichtmlXXX  iDomain  Thumbnails directory exists      try       IdFTP1.Listnil, publichtmlXXX  iDomain  Thumbnails, False     except       on e EIdReplyRFCError do       begin          publichtmlXXX  iDomain  Thumbnails directory does not exist          StatusBar1.SimpleText  Making thumbnail directory...

Negative 8822 pI am using the ACEEditor and trying to figure it out how to make different text areas to find specific variables.

Now, I am trying to find the variable and its value one time only in AREA1 and one time only in AREA2. It mean, search the variable form AREA1 or search the variable from AREA2. The areas are not always in the same line number, so its not possible to do that with line number to line number.p  pIs there a possibility to do thatp
Negative 8822 pHas anybody managed to successfully combine Google authentication with Burt Beckwiths awesome Grailsbased Spring Security plugin recently I wanted to go down that path with Grails 2.4.3, and after some fooling around and recompiling the donbeave version of the plugin at a hrefhttpsgithub.comdonbeavegrailsspringsecurityoauthgoogle relnofollowhttpsgithub.comdonbeavegrailsspringsecurityoauthgooglea I was able to find a combination of references that would compile and run together. I ended up adding the following lines to my BuildConfig.groovyp  precodecompile springsecuritycore2.0RC4 compile springsecurityoauth2.1.0RC4 compile springsecurityoauthgoogle0.3.1 codepre  pI found, however, that the changes created by the initialization command grails s2initoauth dont give me all the modifications that I need in order to move forward. I ended up adding a block to my config.groovy that looked like thisp  precodeoauth      providers          google              api  org.grails.plugin.springsecurity.oauth.GoogleApi20             key  MY KEY             secret  MY SECRET             successUri  oauthgooglesuccess             failureUri  oauthgoogleerror             callback  baseURLoauthgooglecallback             scope  httpswww.googleapis.comauthuserinfo.profile httpswww.googleapis.comauthuserinfo.email                codepre  pThese config definitions specify a callback in my code referred to above as .oauthgooglecallback which didnt exist.  After I brought in a controller from the recommended example a hrefhttpsgithub.combagagegrailsgoogleauthentificationexample relnofollowhttpsgithub.combagagegrailsgoogleauthentificationexamplea, substituted springSecurityOAuthonSuccess for oauthgooglecallback, and registered by redirect URL through the Google Developers Console I found that my onSuccess method was indeed being called, but the data structures referenced in the controller were wrong, and it seemed as if I would need to largely rewrite the controller logic in order to get everything working.  I have to assume that other people want to accomplish Googlebased authentication in the same way that I do.  Is there an complete operational example somewhere Or can someone tell me where Ive gone wrong in my attempt to utilize the standard plugins  Thanks for any assistance.p

Negative 8822 pEven though it seems to point to the enormous number of lines of code 500,000, engineering is unconvinced why it takes 90 mins on a beefy Solaris box with 16GB RAM and dualCPU to finish one Sonar analysis.

Total time is 45  90 mins. p  pWhen i use the incremental option, the analysis time goes down and it does see that only one file has to be analysed.  However, as per the documentation, the diff analysis is not populated in the database, hence rendering that option useless for my purposes.  p  pHow can I reduce the time taken for each SonarQube analysisp

Negative 8822 pMy goal is to process audio data captured from web stream internet radio in Python 3.4.

Writing the stream to the file works fine, so the data are good. I need to decode them every single time new frame is captured to apply some processing in real time, without writing to file. I tried it with pyglet, but it accept only a name of the file as argument, and I dont want to change internal code of the library. PyAudio do not support encoded files. There was a solution like Pymedia, but it wasnt ported to Python 3. There is also GStreamer package, but I found solutions working only on saved files, not on binary data. I have found some other packages like decoder1.5XBWin32, but they work only on files or cant be used with python 3.

Negative 8822 pstrongUPDATE 3strong Before you start reading more, please note that I was able to fix the problem that I had It turned out that there was a memory error in the DLL itself.

And of course it needs lowercase so it breaks my search code.p  pUppercase breaksp  pa hrefhttpsjsfiddle.net362cz1z72 relnofollowhttpsjsfiddle.net362cz1z72ap  pLowercase worksp  pa hrefhttpsjsfiddle.net362cz1z73 relnofollowhttpsjsfiddle.net362cz1z73ap  pBoth give an error Uncaught TypeError undefined is not a function. I am totally confused. If you look at their examples in the docs, some are uppercase and some are lowercase.p

Negative 8822 pI just discovered something that I cant explain in C. When youre working with an array and you send it to a function, no matter how this function receives this array as an array, or as a pointer, it will act like its a pointer. I dont know if I am really clear so here is a little example.p  precodeinclude        ltstdio.hgt  void            modifychar foo[]    printffoos address  pn, ampfoo   printffoos value pointer  pn, foo   foo[0]  Z   int             main    char          foo[]  hello    printffoos address  pn, ampfoo   printffoos value pointer  pn, foo   modifyfoo   printfsn, foo  codepre  pHere is the output  p  precodefoos address  0x7fff9a1a47b0 foos value pointer  0x7fff9a1a47b0 foos address  0x7fff9a1a4798 foos value pointer  0x7fff9a1a47b0 Zello codepre  pIf I declare an array, as its address is the address of its first element, the two first printf calls will display the same thing. But when this array is received by the modify function, again as an array, the next two printf calls are not identical. In the modify function, foo is an array pointer. Going back in the main, the first letter of the array has been modified.  Could someone explain that behavior to me  I dont often work with array, but I thought that passing an array in paramater to a function, would simply make a copy of it like when using a char or an int.p

Expected orders will be loaded on a daily bases based on historical data. p  pShopWorkLoad table is aggregation of WorkLoad table. p  pCurrently I did it this wayp  ul liAdded after insertupdate trigger on Order table when order is createdupdated, if it meets certain conditions, it should be inserted in WorkLoad, otherwise remove it from workload if its in there and doesnt meet conditionsli liAdded after insertupdate trigger on Schedule table when order is scheduled, if it meets certain conditions, it should be inserted in WorkLoad, otherwise remove it from workload if its in there and doesnt meet conditionsli liRunning daily job that populates WorkLoad table with expected orders based on historical values li liFinal step is to create an strongindexed viewstrong vShopWorkLoadli ul  pMy biggest concern is usage of triggers which call pretty complex logic to determine whether item should be added to workload or not. p  pOne other option was to create vWorkLoad view and somehow make it an indexed view but currently I dont see a way of doing that because the query consists of 4 union select statements, below is pseudo example. But even if doing it that way, how to build aggregated indexed view on top of vWorkLoad indexed viewp  pThird option is to use sql agent job which would run every x seconds maybe 20 and it would execute all of these queries to populate WorkLoad table with delay of 1020 seconds, but I am still not sure if this is acceptable to the client.p  pFouth option is to create 3 or 4 indexed view where sum of them makes a workload. Then, ShopWorkLoad view would be built on top of these 3 or 4 indexed views, but in this case I dont know how this would affect performance since ShopWorkLoad query would be often queried.p  pAre there any other suggestions or I should stick with existing solution triggersp  pExample of workload queryp  precodeselect     WorkLoadType  Order in process,     OrderId,     ShopId,     ... from      Order      ...

Negative 8822 pIm trying to call rrdtool xport command on arbitrary number of files, so Im writing a script that reads in the rrd file names and builds the DEF argument.

I have populated the script with lots of alerts statements to try to debug this, but I can find only the symptoms, not the cause.   I have downloaded and installed Fiddler to examine the request and responses I can confirm that the requests are being sent from both IE8 and Firefox, and not only that that the web server is returning the EXACT same responses to both browsers  headers and body.p  pstrongSo the question isstrong Why is this not working  Ajax is no longer a new technology and if it works ok in IE8 6 years old then surely Firefox 31 1 year old should have no problem.  p  pstrongHere is my server request codestrongp  precode  function getServerTime        if http            var url       var userAgent  window.navigator.userAgent       var msie  userAgent.indexOfMSIE gt 0       var msieVerNum       if msie                 The string MSIE has been found so this script            is running under Internet Explorer.

Negative 8822 pI have to implement an extended wifi mutual authentication mechanism. However, I meet some troubles.p  pThis mutual authentication has to implement following requirements.p  blockquote   p1 A server carries a server certificate and a user has a client certificate. The mutual authentication in fact is to authenticate both certificates. I decide to use 802.1x EAPTLS in the project.p      p2 The users client certificate is a little different from general X509 certificate. There should be an attribute storing a hashed value hashed password in the certificate.p      p3 When initiating the mutual authentication, just like general eaptls authentication, the user has to type in his account and password. Then, he will request a server certificate from server and verify it. Next, the server will do the similar way to request a client certificate from the user. However, a difference is that the server will hash the password the user has typed in to compare with that in the client certificate. Two values being identical becomes a condition to finish the authentication.p blockquote  pBy now, I have set up freeradius on Ubuntu as the server and generated CA cert, server cert, and client cert general version, installing them on both Ubuntu and Windows7. Now I have two troubles.p  p1 I guess that maybe I have to use attribute extension in x509 to store a hashed value but I have no idea how operate. p  p2 In the project, a client has to type in a password when he initiates an authentication and then the server has to hash the password to compare with the hashed value in the client cert. I have no idea how to implement this function.p

Negative 8822 pI have thirty three SO2 readings from sensing equipments installed at 33 locations spread over a large region one observation per city.

Negative 8822 pIm a solo developer working at home Ive just rolled out a new server and domain for myself using WSE 2012 R2 Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials Edition. Unfortunately Ive run into some conflicts.p  pAs it turns out, OneDrive doesnt support Roaming Profiles. To make matters worse, File History doesnt support Folder Redirection. So it seems I have to choose between OneDrive and File History. OneDrive is about to win out, but I have an unresolved concern.p  pJust about the only thing Ive ever used File History for is to retrieve snippets of prior versions of code. I rarely work up a spreadsheet and even less often do any word processing. So if TFS can act as a File History of sorts, I should be OK.p  pTrouble is...  Ive never used TFS before yet. I have no idea what the user interface even looks like, let alone how to get around in it. In fact the drive behind this server move has been my need for a TFSBuild implementation. Now, on the way, I find myself having to make this decision.p  pSo. Will I be able to use TFS to locate and open for review without replacing current a single checkedin code file from, say, a given day two months priorp

Negative 8822 pSo Im solving a set of four differential equations in mathematica using NDSolve. I also use ArcSin as a part of the equations.

How do I avoid the cyclic behavior I know, that the condition should be like if ylt0, add pi to the solution.

Negative 8822 pI am looking for the best approach to solve the following requirements. Best here means that performance beats beautiful design, I am not afraid of ugly, but performant designs.p  pHere are the constraintsp  ul liI want to have several codePlayercode in my database. I expect to have 20k Players in there, at most.li liThere is a bunch of codeGamecodes there, too  its a list of about 500 Games. A game wont change once its in there, but occasionally, a game will have to be added. li liThe relationship between codePlayercode and codeGamecode is as follows The player either plays a game or he doesnt, and he has a skill Value from 1 to 5 for every game.li ul  pNow heres the part that really gives me headaches I want to be able to search for multiple codePlayercode by specifying multiple codeGamecodes, a min skill and a max skill. So potentially, I have those 500 games, all compounded by OR, which makes a very long query which isnt very fast. My approach is that I should somehow get rid of the ORs and replace them by ANDs, but if someone is emnotem looking for a specific codeGamecode, it means that he is looking for Players who play or dont play that particular Game Because the user is interested in other Games. p  pI really hope I am missing something obvious or some trick that prevents me from having hundreds of ORClauses in every search request...p  pI tried it with Parse hence the tag and got an error codecode154,messagetoo many or clausescodep

Negative 8822 pstrongADDED PREFACEstrongp  pHere I want better explain the scenario of my application.p  pI need a windows service to convert a SerialPort into a TCPPort. For instance lets say I have a serial ticket printer connected to a COM port for raw ascii stream and I want to access it by TCP sockets from network. The result should be that the serial printer becomes a network printer, my service should link many tcp sockets to com port.p  pThis is the scheme img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrREN0.png altenter image description herep  pThe main problem is that the COM port has a unique connection but here I can have many simultaneous connection from network clients. I need to synchronize  writes to COMport and get output from the COMport and copy that to all connected TCP clients.p  pWith TCPconnections I cannot know when a write stream is really close, because a network client can send a print job without closing its connection and send another job after a while. Serial printers are inline printer and there is not a startend command, it can simply receive ascii chars and they are printer in receiving order. This is because I need to be sure that network input will not be mixed and I want a timer that can understand that the job is really end before relase the synchronized write lock.p  hr  pstrongORIGINAL QUESTIONstrongp  pI have two threads strongAstrong, strongBstrong.p  pBoth threads have to write in a single output buffer by WriteToOutput method, and I want to be sure that the output will not be mixed if both strongAstrong and strongBstrong want to write in the output at the same time. For first I need a simple semaphorep  precodeprivate object locker  new object  public void WriteToOutputbyte[] threadBuffer      lock locker              ... copy threadBuffer to outputBuffer       codepre  pBut I need a little more safety to divide the outputs because a thread can empty its buffer but it can be filler right after the lock release.p  pSo in case of concurrency if the thread strongAstrong gets the lock, I want to wait the second thread strongBstrong for while, lets say a tick of 1s. If in this time the thread strongAstrong wants to write something more, it has the priority, and strongBstrong has to wait another tick. If the thread strongAstrong do not write for a n entire tick, then it can really relase the lock and the strongBstrong thread can get the lock.p

Negative 8822 pNote This code was not originally written by me, and I would prefer modifyinghacking over rewriting.p  pI have two Umbraco content pages NewListing amp UpdateListing which both use the same ASP.NET macro NewListing.ascx. A listing can be free, or paid, in which case it has ListingExtras attached to it. The workflow for both a new or modified listing with extras is as followsp  ol liUser chooses extrasli liUser clicks appropriate button Next new listing, or Update modifying listingli liPayment div with a special confirmation message and b subscription options is made visibleli liUser chooses one of aforementioned options, clicks Add to Cartli liUser sent to payment options page EFTetc.li ol  pNotesp  ul liThe subscription options do not appear if it is a listing without extrasli liFree listings get a Submit button at step 3 aboveli liFree listings have their own confirmation message in the payment div, just without subscription options.li liNext and Update are different buttons, handled in separate button handlers, made visible according to the UpdateMode property. However, the code is identical in these handlers  checks some categories, checks what extras were added and increments an amount variable, checks for a nonzero amount, adds month options as new listitems to a listcontrol, and changes visibility if there are nonzero listitems in that control.li ul  pSo, new listings go to sitenewlisting.aspx, and existing listings to siteupdatelisting.aspxrefnofoonum. PageLoad does not do any special handling, other than setting a hidden field value for the reference number if the pages UpdateMode property is true. p  pNewlisting works perfectly despite postbacks I just added some logging to PageLoad, but updatelisting just resets during the postback, meaning the amount gets set to 0, with no monthpayment options.p  pMy suspicion is that this is lifecycle driven, but Im not sure why it wouldnt work for one, other than that the path not matching the usercontrol must be problematic. Any ideas on getting around this other than writing an updatelisting usercontrol, or correction of my diagnosisp

All went fine, but yesterday the two of them got in a fight.p  pI have an codengrepeatcode in my application, but on this list theres a jQuery script that resizes all the buttons to a certain size based on the device and browser.p  pThis is the htmlp  precodeltdiv classlistwrappergt     lttablegt         lttheadgt             lttrgt                 ltthgtRestaurantltthgt                 ltthgtLocationltthgt                 ltthgtStatusltthgt                 ltthgtActionsltthgt             lttrgt         lttheadgt         lttbody classlistviewbodygt             lttr ngrepeatrestaurant in restaurantsgt                 lttdgt restaurant.name lttdgt                 lttdgt restaurant.location lttdgt                 lttdgt restaurant.status lttdgt                 lttdgt restaurant.actions lttdgt             lttrgt         lttbodygt     lttablegt ltdivgt codepre  pI have a jQuery function that checks how many rows there are inside codelistviewbodycode by running codeelement.lengthcode.
