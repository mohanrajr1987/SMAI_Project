Positive 317 pWe have mysql database with auto increment columnid as primary key for all tables and which is referred in another table as foreign key. We have planned to use index for some of the columns in order to increase the accessing time of the table.p  pIs it necessary to create index for auto increment columnid which is referred in another table as foreign key, or by default mysql using index mechanism internally for the column that is referred as foreign key. In any case, If we use index on foreign key, whether it will faster the accessing time p  pThanks in advance.....  p

Here is my code so farp  precoded[] for i,x in enumeratelist     if x[2]0         for j,y in enumeratelist             if x[1]y[1] and jgti and y[2]0                 d.appendy[0]x[0]     else d.append0  print d codepre  pI did this in excel using MATCH and OFFSET functions, but Im a bit lost transitioning to index and enumerate here.p  pMy first problem is that the nested for loop doesnt stop when it finds the first match, and so it keeps appending t value differences for every matching n value.  Id only like to find the first match.p  pMy second query is if theres a better way to do this, so the nested for loop isnt always starting at the beginning of my list, and instead starts at the index i.  Im dealing with quite large data sets.p  pEDIT I managed to make it work, though its quite inelegant times and notes are lists of the 1st and 2nd elements of each tuple in listp  precoded[] for i,x in enumeratelist     if x[2]0         d.appendnotes[i1].indexx[1]     else d.appendNA   dur[] for i,j in enumerated     if jNA         dur.appendtimes[ij1]times[i]     else dur.append0 codepre  pId appreciate any ideas on a cleaner solution.p

However, the database tables are huge and this has become a bottleneck.p  pIn this example, we could simply increase the codetotalreaderscode by one on each view, instead of actually counting the database rows. However, this is just a simplified model structure and we cannot do this in reality here.p  pWhat I can do, is creating another field in the Reader model called codebookauthoridcode. Thus, I denormalize data and can count the Reader objects without having PostgreSQL making the codeLEFT OUTER JOINcode with the User table. Finally, heres my question Is it possible to create some sort of database index, so that PostgreSQL handles this denormalization automatically Or do I really have to create this additional model field and redundantly store the authors PK in therep  pEDIT  to point out the essential question I got several great answers, which work for a lot of scenarios.

This is trivial in SQL. The problem is that my repository wont be able to read and fit this type of data into the model. Where do the max dates and the counts gop  pIm not asking how to do that. You can always do it emsomehowem add extra methods to the repository, add new classes, special entities, use LINQ etc., but I guess my question is the following. How come the repository pattern and the proper model driven development are so widely accepted, but yet they dont seem to address this seemingly very common and basic case. p
Negative 317 pI am currently trying to obfuscate my Eclipse RCP application with ProGuard. The problem is that it obfuscates the package names the class My.Package.Class turns into something like a.b.c, but keeps the package names in the ExportPackage section of MANIFEST.MF.p  pThis leads to the fact that my application which is a set of OSGibundles, actually cannot be run, as the package names specified in ExportPackage section of MANIFEST.MFs cannot be resolved.p  pHas anybody had any success with ProGuard obfuscating an OSGibased RCP application Basically, I see two choices either completely turn off package names obfuscation, or obfucate MANIFEST.MFs ExportPackage section, but I cant find the way to implement any of them. Proguard seems to obfuscate only BundleActivator class name in MANIFEST.MF, skipping all other sections. Thanks in advancep

Negative 317 pWhats the best way to have an actor sleep I have actors set up as agents which want to maintain different parts of a database including getting data from external sources. For a number of reasons including not overloading the database or communications and general load issues, I want the actors to sleep between each operation.

So I imagine a Thread.sleep in each actor would be a bad idea as would waste threads unnecessarily.p  pI could perhaps have a central actor with its own loop that sends messages to subscribers on a clock like async event clock observersp  pHas anyone done anything similar or have any suggestions Sorry for extra perhaps superfluous information.p  pCheersp  pJoep

Negative 317 pLets take a look at the infamous IDisposable interfacep  precode[ComVisibletrue] public interface IDisposable      void Dispose  codepre  pand a typical implementation, as recommended by MSDN I omitted the check if current object has already been disposedp  precodepublic class Base  IDisposable      protected virtual void Disposebool disposing              if disposing                       release managed                   release unmanaged         disposed  true           public void Dispose              Disposetrue         GC.SuppressFinalizethis           Base              Disposefalse        public class Derived  Base      protected override void Disposebool disposing              base.Disposedisposing         if disposing                       release managed                   release unmanaged         disposed  true       codepre  pProblem is I think this implementation is counterintuitive. And it is also significantly different in base and derived class. Derived class is supposed to emassumeem that base class implemented IDisposable properly and then override Disposebool, which is not even a part of the original interface.p  pI have to admit, I came up with this question because I usually ask junior programmers to implement IDisposable on a job interview. If they dont exactly know how its supposed to be done, they come up with something close to thisp  precodepublic class Base  IDisposable      public virtual void Dispose               release managed and unmanaged         GC.SuppressFinalizethis           Base               release unmanaged        public class Derived  Base      public override void Dispose               release managed and unmanaged         base.Dispose           Derived               release unmanaged       codepre  pTo me, this implementation is more clear and more consistent. Of course, the bad thing is that we have to release unmanaged resources in two different places, but the important point is that probably over 99 custom classes do not have anything unmanaged to dispose, so they wont need a finalizer anyway. I cant explain to a junior programmer why MSDN implementation is better because I dont really understand it myself.p  pSo Im wondering, what led to such unusual design decisions making derived class to override a different method than the one in the interface and making him think about unmanaged resources which it most probably doesnt contain. Any thoughts on this matterp

Negative 317 pThe question doesnt really concerne DDD but would like to know if there is any way to model a loosely coupled domain model. What I mean by that  I work for a software HR editor and were planning to start a new application from scratch. We did an audit of all projects we did for our 150 customers and the fact is that we cant say there is one valid domain model from the point of view of DDD. p  pWhy  Because each company deals with HR in different ways depending on how big the company is, etc. etc.p  pOf course we can identify commun entities in HR domain like job, offer, collaborator, skills, etc, but they are not linked the same way for the client A and the client B. So from the point of view of Domain Model we cant say that Entity A has a reference to Entity B which have a collection of skills because it wont be true for another customer.p  pEven if for 80 of our customer we can design a model that adresses 90 of needs we wont sacrify the rest of the customers and on the other hand would like to have a product witouht doing specific development to address differents concerns.p  pWe looked at BPM solutions but that doesnt fit well with our needs. On the other hand I cant imagine how you can handle what we need. In fact the links between entities should be done at runtime from a sort of parameter, xml, etc. for each client. We would like to not have to code another application because the domain model has slightly changed. This could be completely insane to not have a propper Domain Model but something based on messaging could help us.p  pWould like your thoughs about that. How did you deal with such a situations.p  pThanks,p

Negative 317 pIm after help on how to use complex objects either as return values or passed as parameters to C class methods exposed to unmanaged C as COM componentsp  pHeres whyp  pIm working on a project where we have half a dozen unmanaged C applications that each directly access the same Microsoft SQL Server database. We want to be able to use MSSqlOracleMySql with minimum changes and weve decided to implement a business logic plus data layer exposed via WCF services to get the required flexibility.p  pThis strategy hinges on being able to get the unmanaged C to interop with the WCF service. There are a number of ways to do this, but the strategy I want to follow is to create a C assembly exposed as a COM component which will act as a bridge between C and the WCF layer. This C assembly will be loaded into unmanaged C process as COM component.p  pThe C bridge assembly will contain a helper class which has a number of methods that describe the operations that were formerly expressed as direct sql or stored proc calls in the C code.p  pI have two problems to solvep  p1 For an INSERT, I need to pass an object representing the entity to be inserted. On the unmanaged C side, the I already know that one of the entities has about 40 properties which have to make it into SQL  I dont want a C method with 40 parameters, I want to pass an object I dont know how to marshal a C object via COM into C, so I thought about defining a Stuct on the C side and then make the Struct COM visible.p  p2 How to return the result of a SELECT this, that, other, ... . Ive seen two examples. One returns a struct[] and another returns a single struct containing a string[] for each column field and an int count member describing the length of the other member arrays.p  pOn the C side, I think it will be a case of defining and exposing a number of requestresponse structs which will be used to pass data inout. These structs will need to be decorated with attributes that cause their members not to change position as a result of optimization. And the struct members may need to be decorated with the attribute that hints to the marshaller how the member should be exposed in COM.p  pThen of course Ill have to work out how to instantiate and populate these structs as seen as COM objects from the unmanaged C, then Ill have to pass them in method calls and process them as return values.p  pThis is the most difficult part for me I grok C and some MFCATL but COM under C is a whole extra level of complexity.

I think the OS maintains its own buffer for receive UDP data, right for e.g., if a udp packet is sent to my machine, the OS will put it to a buffer and wait us to Socket.ReceiveFrom or UdpClient.receive, rightp  pHow can I change the size of that internal bufferp  pI have tried Socket.ReceiveBuffSize, it has no effect at all for UDP, and it clearly said that it is for TCP window.

For each packet, I create a thread a handle it. I used UdpClient or Socket to receive the packets.p  pI lost about 50 of the packets. I think it is a burst of the UDP sending and I cant handle all of them in time.p  pThis is why I want to increase the buffer size for UDP. say, if I change the buffer size to 1MB, then 27  10KB  270KB data can be accepted in the buffer, rightp  pI tried changing Socket.ReceiveBufferSize to many many values, and it just does not have effects at all.p  pAny one can helpp
Negative 317 pI have an Ext codeTreePanelcode which Im trying to add some serverside pagination to. Were using Ext 2.2.0.p  pWe have a customized tree which only has two tiers. We are listing 25 items under the tree itself the root, but each item node can have an unlimited amount of children. Im guessing these are the leafs. The item nodes are using a custom codeuiProvidercode, as are all of the children.p  pIve added some images for prevnext page to the codeitemNodeUIcode and added handlers which updates the item nodes attributes with the pageNumber. The codeDataUrlcode php file grabs these attributes and basically appends codeLIMITcode to the sql query.p  pEverything works as it should, except when you click on the nextprev images, the item node collapses. If you expand the node, everything is as it should be, but I either need the node to stay expanded, or have it automagically reexpand after load.

Negative 317 pWell, here we are. Yet another proposed practice that my C book has an opinion on. It says a returningvaluenonvoid function should not take reference types as a parameter. So basically if you were to implement a function like thisp  precodeint readfileintamp into    ...  codepre  pand used the integer return value as some sort of error indicator ignoring the fact that we have exceptions then that function would be poorly written and it should actually be likep  precodevoid readfileintamp into, intamp error   codepre  pNow to me, the first one is much clearer and nice to use. If you want to ignore the error value, you do so with ease. But this book suggests the later. Note that this book does not say returning value functions are bad. It rather says that you should either only return a value or you should only use references. p  pWhat are your thoughts on this Is my book full of crap again p
Negative 317 pI have an interfacep  precodepublic abstract class AuthorizerltTgt where T  RequiresAuthorization      public AuthorizationStatus AuthorizeT record               Perform authorization specific stuff          and then hand off to an abstract method to handle Tspecific stuff          that should happen when authorization is successful        codepre  pThen, I have a bunch of different classes which all implement RequiresAuthorization, and correspondingly, an codeAuthorizerltTgtcode for each of them each business object in my domain requires different logic to execute once the record has been authorized.p  pIm also using a UnityContainer, in which I register various codeAuthorizerltTgtcodes. I then have some code as follows to find the right record out of the database and authorize itp  precodevoid AuthorizeRequiresAuthorization item      var dbItem  ChildContainer.ResolveltIAuthorizationRepositorygt                                .RetrieveRequiresAuthorizationByIditem.Id     var authorizerType  type.GetTypeString.FormatFoo.Authorizer1[[0]], Foo,                              dbItem.GetType.AssemblyQualifiedName     dynamic authorizer  ChildContainer.Resolvetype as dynamic      authorizer.AuthorizedbItem  codepre  pBasically, Im using the Id on the object to retrieve it out of the database. In the background NHibernate takes care of figuring out what type of iRequiresAuthorizationi it is. I then want to find the right Authorizer for it I dont know at compile time what implementation of codeAuthorizerltTgtcode I need, so Ive got a little bit of reflection to get the fully qualified type. To accomplish this, I use the nongeneric overload of UnityContainers Resolve method to look up the correct authorizer from configuration.p  pFinally, I want to call Authorize on the authorizer, passing through the object Ive gotten back from NHibernate.p  pNow, for the problemp  pIn Beta2 of VS2010 the above code works perfectly. On RC and RTM, as soon as I make the Authorize call, I get a RuntimeBinderException saying The best overloaded method match for codeFoo.AuthorizerltBargt.AuthorizeBarcode has some invalid arguments. When I inspect the authorizer in the debugger, its the correct type. When I call GetType.GetMethods on it, I can see the Authorize method which takes a Bar. If I do GetType on dbItem it is a Bar.p  pBecause this worked in Beta2 and not in RC, I assumed it was a regression it seems like it should work and I delayed sorting it out until after Id had a chance to test it on the RTM version of C 4.0. Now Ive done that and the problem still persists. Does anybody have any suggestions to make this workp  pThanks p  pTerencep
Negative 317 pI have some code that is using reflection to pull property values from an object.

Negative 317 pIve got a strange issue with a server accepting TCP connections. Even though there are normally some processes waiting, at some volume of connections it hangs.p  pLong versionp  pThe server is written in Perl and binds a codesrvcode socket with the reuse flag and listen  5. Afterwards, it forks into 10 processes with a loop of codecltsrvgtaccept doprocessingclt cltgtshutdown2codep  pThe client written in C is also very simple  it sends some lines, then receives all lines available and does a codeshutdownsockfd, 2code Theres nothing async going on and at the end both send and receive queues are empty as reported by codenetstatcode.p  pConnections last only 20ms. All clients behave the same way, are the same implementation, etc. Now lets say Im accepting codeXcode connections from client 1 and another codeXcode from client 2. Processes still report that theyre idle all the time. If I add another codeXcode connections from client 3, suddenly the server processes start hanging just after accepting. The first blocking thing they do after codeacceptcode is codewhile ltcltgt ...code  but they dont get any data on the first try already. Suddenly all 10 processes are in this state and do not stop waiting. On codestracecode, the server processes seem to hang on codereadcode, which makes sense.p  pThere are loads of connections in codeTIMEWAITcode state belonging to that server 100 when the problem starts to manifest, but this might be a red herring.p  pWhat could be happening herep  hr  pAfter some more analysis It turned out that the client was at fault, not closing previous connections properly before trying the next one. The servers at the beginning of the loadbalancing list were left stale connections.p

Negative 317 pI have an aspx page and I want to access an application on the client after seeking user permission. Both the windows application and the website are to be made in VB.NET. Does any one have any idea as how to go about solving this problem  Thanksp  pEDIT Here is the problem. From my .aspx webpage in vb.net, a visitor clicks on a link on my site, and if my winform is not already loaded on their desktop, it is then loaded with the users permission. This application should autoload on the users site at boot up time and always be in the background running. Make it an extremely thin client, taking the least cpu and bandwidth from the user, and running as a silent background process until needed.p  pWhenever the user visits one of my many websites, IN ANY BROWSER, somehow  the app running in the background communicates with the .aspx on one of my sites, and exchanges a silent username password identifying client winform app to the online .aspx app on my website.p  pThen the .aspx on my site PASSES a url such as www.somewebsite.com to the app running in the background, the background app then does a http request from the clients computer, not from my .aspx server, so the clients cookies and ip are visible to www.somewebsite.com server. The client collects the html for that page, stores it as a string, and also saves the ascii of that webpage as another string.p  pBoth strings then are PASSED BACK to my .aspx website that the client is visiting, and the .aspx app then stores these results in a database.p

This all needs to happen in an HtmlWindow. I want it to act like a real web browser when it comes to loading images you see the frames and the images slowly appearp

Negative 317 pI am currently developing a WebGLbased application, and I am having some trouble with shader storagep  pI see in most examples that shaders are written in plaintext in the xHTML file itself. However this clutters the file and does not allow caching. Also, its not convinient to edit and reuse them. Having one file per shader is the best for organization. I can still insert them, with PHP, in the generated output, but it increases the size of the pages and cant be efficiently cached.p  pAnother solution is to fetch every shader with XmlHttpRequest, but Im afraid the number of HTTP requests for a fresh page load especially when you have dozens of shaders might quickly become a performance issue.p  pFinally, Ive been thinking about dynamically putting all the shaders in a file, then loading it with a XmtHttpRequest. Its only one request, for one file that can be cached locally by the browser. Yet, my JS is not that good and I dont know how I should do it.

Negative 317 pIm making a selfdubbed knowledge engine, where the user types in a question and online encyclopedias are searched, then returned with a simple answer.  How can a query be broken apart into parts of speech using PHP so the subject of the question can be identified  Say, for instance, the example query was, Who is the British Prime Minister  Obviously, Who is a pronoun, is is an auxiliary verb, the is an article so it could probably be ignored and the sentence would still make sense, and British Prime Minister would be the main query Im supposing.

Negative 317 pI have a puzzle game where the board is a rectangle and the border is made up of piece that are one grid unit long. I have a method that randomizes the images and wraps them around the level, but... its really terrible. And it has the strangest bug Depending on what version of Android is running it behaves differently. On 2.1, the borders arent aligned properly when the activity starts, but they fix themselves as soon as a piece is moved. Not when a piece moves, but when it is moved to a different position if I were to drag it across the screen and drop it back in the same spot, nothing would happen. When the piece is actually dropped MotionEvent.ACTIONUP is when the border corrects itself. In 2.2 it starts of correctly, but when I load a new level which doesnt start a new activity but calls createBorder again it acts the same way. Heres what it looks like  p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9n8oK.gif altenter image description herep  pHere is my createBorder method  p  precodeprivate void createBorderint h, int w, int

Like I said I know the page level headers can be removed withp  precode        jasperPrint.getPropertiesMap.setPropertynet.sf.jasperreports.export.exclude.origin.band.1, pageHeader         jasperPrint.getPropertiesMap.setPropertynet.sf.jasperreports.export.exclude.origin.band.2, pageFooter         jasperPrint.getPropertiesMap.setPropertynet.sf.jasperreports.export.csv.exclude.origin.band.1, columnHeader         jasperPrint.getPropertiesMap.setPropertynet.sf.jasperreports.export.csv.exclude.origin.band.2, pageFooter         jasperPrint.getPropertiesMap.setPropertynet.sf.jasperreports.export.csv.exclude.origin.keep.first.band.1, columnHeader codepre  pbut I am looking for a solution to remove them on table for CSV output only, not PDF.

Negative 317 pMy first problem is that the Web Service is slow the first time. I followed the other threadsp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions784918asmxwebserviceslowfirstrequestASMX Web Service slow first request.ap  pAnd got the right solution, but when I enable Generate serialization I get an error on compile SGENerrorCouldnotloadfileorassembly a hrefhttpbimbim.inpost20100906SGENerrorCouldnotloadfileorassembly.aspx relnofollowhttpbimbim.inpost20100906SGENerrorCouldnotloadfileorassembly.aspxa Which tells me to disable it to fix the error.p  pAnother thing Im not really sure on is that I have 1 browser open, and say the web service has a call that takes 10 seconds, it takes 10 seconds and if i load up another browser while the first browser is loading that 10 second method I cant see the webpage until the first page is done.p  pSo  One tab in browser sends requests to service that takes 10 seconds. Load another tab, same URL but it wont even load until the first request is completed. So I realize there must be some kind of instancing I should do herep
Negative 317 pI have the following problem.p  pI have a MMORPG game based on PHP and MySQL with now around 600 queries per second averagely.  I happen to have problems with tables which are locked too long and are holding up other queries. Update queries for example need to wait on Select queries and these have to wait so long that the memory is full.p  pThose queries are needed and I dont think I can optimize them anymore.p  pIs it a smart idea to use replication for MasterSlave Master for the writes and slave for the selects  Does the slave has less problems in performance with write statements from the logbin than the master And will it really help getting less table lock problemsp  pThanks in advance, Martinp  hr  pAh okay, thanks for answering.  So if I use InnoDB for those tables. Is it smart to mix them up with MyISAMp  pBecause a test table which was 70MB with MyISAM became 200MB with InnoDB. Id rather had some tables which have problems with tablelocks InnoDB and the others just MyISAM.p  pThanks in advance, Martin.p

Negative 317 pI need some guidance on adding  updating SQL records using EF. Lets say I am writing an application that stores info about files on a hard disk, into an EF4 database. When you press a button, it will scan all the files in a specified path maybe the whole drive, and store information in the database like the file size, change date etc. Sometimes the file will already be recorded from a previous run, so its properties should be updated sometimes a batch of files will be detected for the first time and will need to be added.p  pI am using EF4, and I am seeking the most efficient way of adding new file information and updating existing records. As I understand it, when I press the search button and files are detected, I will have to check for the presence of a file entity, retrieve its ID field, and use that to add or update related information but if it does not exist already, I will need to create a tree that represents it and its related objects eg. its folder path, and add that. I will also have to handle the merging of the folder path object as well.p  pIt occurs to me that if there are many millions of files, as there might be on a server, loading the whole database into the context is not ideal or practical. So for every file, I might conceivably have to make a round trip to the database on disk to detect if the entry exists already, retrieve its ID if it exists, then another trip to update. Is there a more efficient way I can insertupdate multiple file object trees in one trip to the DB If there was an Entity context method like Insert If It Doesnt Exist And Update If It Does for example, then I could wrap up multiple in a transactionp  pI imagine this would be a fairly common requirement, how is it best done in EF Any thoughts would be appreciated.oh my DB is SQLITE if that makes a differencep

Negative 317 pI am fairly new to WPF but have spent time researching WPF validation, and have not yet seen a good approach to conditional validation.p  pTo simplify the situation greatly, lets say I have two textboxes and a submit button. The user enters a string in the first textbox. If the user enters, for example ABC, then the second textbox should be a required field Id want the background to be a light blue color, to signify this, and the submit button should be disabled until that textbox is populated.p  pHow can this be done Is there an easy way to addremove validations in runtime DataAnnotations httpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.componentmodel.dataannotations.aspx seemed like a good starting place, however I cant mark a field with the [Required] attribute, as the field wont always be required. Basically, I need something like Required if Field1  ABCp  pThanksp

Negative 317 pCurrently, MySQL community edition server 5.5.16 is under GPL. This means that it might be used in projects that are open source projects too. Our project budget is very tight and we need to find a solution to use MySQL free edition in commercial project. I have several questionsp  p1 What earlier MySQL version would be solid and bugfree enough to use in commercial projects p  p2 About using current MySQL community edition server 5.5.16 with GPL if a project software architecture is designed with support for plugging many DBMSs then is it legal to have a project software under nonGPL license I mean, suppose the software is designed with multiple DBMS support and the software is put under commercial license. If the client chooses to use MySQL GPL version does he violate GPL licensep  p3 I heard some negative replies about PostgreSQL being buggy and nonoptimized for modifying and storing large sets of data. The only reason its still used in some small commercial projects is because its free. What are your opinions on thatp  pUPDATE also, we are planning to use several servers, so masterslave replication is also needed. p  pUPDATE2 I heard about one case there was used 1GB PostgreSQL DB. The database was heavily used  with updates by modifying almost all data. The problem was the database was constantly growing about ten times every 2.5 month. They have used PostgreSQL 8.3  CentOS. Also, AUTOVACUUM was used. After dumping database, destroying the old one, recreating database and importing they were able to reduce its size 10 times. Existing posts a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions924993postgresqldatabasesizeincreasingherea and a hrefhttpserverfault.comquestions278542postgresql9databasesizeswellingafterdailybulkupdatesherea show that this problem is relative even in latest PostgreSQL 9 version.

Negative 317 pCurrently I am working with a embedded system that has the Linux OS. I need to run multiple application at the same time, and I would like them to be able to run through one script. A fellow colleague already had implemented this by using a wrapper script and return codes.p  precodewrapperScript.sh command amp gt outputlog.txt wrapperScript.sh command2 amp gtoutputlog2.txt codepre  pBut the problem arises in when exiting the application. Normally all the application that are on the embedded system require a user to press codeqcode to exit. But the wrapper script rather than doing that when it gets the kill signal or user signal, it just kill the process. This is dangerous because the wrapper script assumes that the application has the proper facilities to deal with the kill signal that is not always the case and leads to memory leaks and unwanted socket connections. I have looked into automating programs such as expect but since I am using an embedded board, I am unable to get expect for it. Is there a way in the bash shell or embedded C to deal with multiple process have one single program automatically send the codeqcode signal to the programs.p  pI also would like the capability to maintain log and the output of the files.p  pEDITp  pSolutionp  pOkay I found the issue to the problem, Expect is the way to go about it in any situation. There is a serious limitation that it might slower, but the trade off is not bad in this situation. I decided to use Expect Scripting Language to implement the solution. There are certain trade off. p  pPros  Precise control over embedded application  Can Make Process Interactive to User  can Deal with Multiple Process p  pCons  Performance is slowp

Negative 317 pFirst, a clarification By interface, I mean any point of interaction between components, not necessarily the abstract type kind of interface. Although if I can use such an interface to do this, great.p  pIm writing a class which is designed to be extended. The problem domain is global optimization, so any enduserprogrammer who subclasses my class Ill call them Steve will be providing their own problem and algorithm to solve it I just provide the framework networking, user interface, etc.. Steves program might require any number of configuration settings I want my code to be able to get those settings from the user the same way it gets its own settings be that from a GUI control panel, an XML configuration file, or whatever. Steve should not have to duplicate any of my code, nor should he have to break Javas type safety or encapsulation model.p  pIdeally, Steve would be able to write something along these linesp  precodepublic class SteveClass extends MyFrameworkClass       Configurable     private int foo      Configurable     private String bar      private boolean baz       implementations of my abstract methods, etc.   codepre  pcodeConfigurablecode is an annotation that I would provide, that indicates that the annotated variable is a configuration setting that I should get from the user. As you can see, I also want Steve to be able to declare other instance variables for his own internal use, that I never touch.p  pI was going to implement this by including a method in codeMyFrameworkClasscode that would iterate through codegetClass.getDeclaredFieldscode and identify the fields that have codeConfigurablecode annotations. It would then writes the user input to those fields. It doesnt have to look exactly like this, with annotations and all, but you get the idea.p  pThe problem with this, of course, is that codefoocode and codebarcode are private and code in codeMyFrameworkClasscode cant write to them, even reflectively. It wouldnt help if they were packageprivate, since Steves code wont be in the same package as mine, and Id rather not require him to make them public, or to add any other interface that would allow anyone but me to access the fields.p  pIs there any way to do what I want, either by fiddling with codeSecurityManagercode or doing something completely differentp

The rest of the data in my database does make sense to be relational, however I believe I could scale much more easily and cheaply if I instead store pointers to flat files where each pointer is to a different text file stored in something like S3 instead of using the text field.p  pAn alternative that seems to be gaining popularity is a fully NoSQL documentbased solution e.g. CouchDB, MongoDB, etc.  I am wondering what are the tradeoffs scalabilityreliabilitysecurityperformanceease of implementationease of maintenancecost between simply using a SQL text field, having a pointer to flat files, or completely rethinking the entire system in the context of a NoSQL document storep

Negative 317 pOk so I know I am very very new to .NET remoting and I have a question as far as best practice goes. First, I already have an inhouse application that I have built and have dlls that I reference that handle all of the data for me. I want the Server version of my application to be able to utilize all of those classes and their methods and be able to pass those custom objects back and forth. p  pMy question is, should I, apply [Serializable] to all of my classes that I want to pass back and forth and then create special classes that specifically use my methods to Get, AddOrUpdate, Delete, etc p  pRight now, I have Get, AddOrUpdate, and Delete methods in all of my classes that communicate back and forth with my database. I have already learned that I cant MarshalByRefObject amp [Serializable] to all of those classes or I will run into issues. So, thats why I am thinking I need to create separate classes that do Management ex. Get, AddOrUpdate, Delete as opposed to having Property definitions as well as Method calls.p  pAn example of what I am thinking needs to be done.p  precode[Serializable]     public class Users          region Properties...         private int userID         private string displayName         private string userName         private string firstName         private string lastName         private string LogOnPassword         private ListltUsersgt Associates  new ListltUsersgt         private AuthenticationLevel authorizationLevel         private string userSettingsXML         private string active         private string signature         private int PhoneExtension         private int Index         private ListltUserAssignedRolesgt Roles  new ListltUserAssignedRolesgt codepre  pThen to actually create a list I would have a separate class called something like UserManagement.p  precodepublic class UserManagement  MarshalByRefObject       public ListltUsersgt GetUsers          codepre  pAny advice is greatly appreciatedp

Negative 317 pI am designing an app that will keep track of all users latlong.  For each user it will calculate the distance between all other users in a city.  I will be using python.p  pFor example My client will update a database with its longlat every x seconds.  Each time it updates it will have to recalculate the distance between itself and all other users that are logged on.p  pMy plan was to split up cities into their own tables, so as to keep the data set and calculations smaller.  But the more I think about this idea gets worse and worse.  I dont think it would scale at all if there were any signficant amount of traffic.  People would have to be confined to a major metropolitan area if they want to use the app which would limit the user base.p  pso my question isp  pIs there a storage backend that is optimized to do these calculations  I have just heard about PostGIS this morning but from what I have read it seems like it might be overkill All I plan on doing is calculating the distance between latlongs.

Negative 317 pI have a web application project referencing other projects and dll.  A while back, we had added the optimizeCompilationstrue flag to the web.config in order to decrease the wait time for the initial page refresh after making changes to one of the related files.  We got the wait time down to about 1520 seconds.p  pHowever, at some point, wait got much longer and I cant figure out whats the cause.  I read a bunch of articles on that flag and know one really describes how it determines when to recompile the entire site inside the Framework temp folder.  It seems that no matter what I recompile whether it be a referenced dlls or the web app dll itself, when I visit the first page, the entire contents of the framework temp folder gets recreated taking about 90 seconds.p  pIs there anyway to trackdown whats causing this.p  pOn thing that makes me thing the optimizeCompilation flag is not working is that when it was working, occassionally we would run into one of those side cases where a change would require the entire site to be updated and we would get an error.  At that point we had to do a rebuild to fix it. I cant remember the last time that has happened.p  pThe way I understand it, even if the Dlls change in the root, the entire site will NOT recompile if that flag is set.p  pAlso, I found something odd.  In the framework temp folder for the web site, theres a hash.web file containing a hash code.  Im assuming this is the code the compiler uses to see if something changed.  As a test, I recorded that code, made a change to a source file and compiled. I then checked the bin folder and noted that the only changed files were a few DLLs.  I refreshed my web page in my broswer and it took over a minute to refresh. I then checked the framework temp folder and mostly all the files had the current data, meaning they were all recompiled.  However, when I checked the hash code in hash.web, it was the same.  I would have thought that would have been different.p

Negative 317 pI have a lot of existing data in my database already, and want to develop a points mechanism that computes a score for each user based on what actions they do. p  pI am implementing this functionality in a pluggable way, so that it is independent of the main logic, and relies on Spring events being sent around, once an entity gets modified. p  pThe problem is what to do with the existing data. I do not want to start collecting points from now, but rather include all the data until now. p  pWhat is the most practical way to do this Should I design my plugins in such a way as to provide for an index method, which will force my system to fetch every single entity from the database, send an EntityDirtyEvent, to fire the points plugins, for each one, and then update it, to let points get saved next to each entity. That could result in a lot of overhead, rightp  pThe simplest thing would be to create a complex stored procedure, and then make the index call that stored procedure. That however, seems to me like a bad thing either. Since I will have to write the logic for computing the points in java anyway, why have it once again in SQL Also, in general I am not a fan of splitting business logic into the different layers.p  pHas anyone done this before Please help.p

Negative 317 pAll right, so I have made a basic game, in which I made a character go left and right using a and d and allowed it to jump. What Im trying to do right now is get it so that the terrain generated will allow the character to stop on top of it. For example, if the character jumps, then it will stop on top of a block when it touches it. What I really need is just some basic code that will work well for the code I have already written, not an entire rewriting. And as a side note, many have said to use KeyBindings instead of KeyListener, but the KeyListener works a lot better in the way Im handling this coding.

Negative 317 pA string abab could be thought of as a pattern of indexed symbols 0101.  And a string bcbc would also be represented by 0101.  Thats pretty nifty and makes for powerful comparisons, but it quickly falls apart out of perfect cases.p  pbabcbc would be 010202.  If I wanted to note that it contains a pattern equal to 0101 the bcbc part, I can only think of doing some sort of normalization process at each index to rerepresent the substring from n to length symbolically for comparison.  And that gets complicated if Im trying to see if babcbc and dababd 010202 vs 012120 have anything in common.  So inefficientp  pHow could this be done efficiently, taking care of all possible nested cases  Note that Im looking for similar patterns, not similar substrings in the actual text.p

It would be better if it would just tell me exactly why it failed.p  pDoes anybody know if such an error checking system exists for iostreams ostreams in particular Maybe in boostp

Negative 317 pIve got a doozey of a problem that Ive been working on for a few weeks. It involves stuttering UI performance whenever I save my Core Data managed object context. Ive gotten as far as I can on my own and am looking for some help.p  h1The Situationh1  pMy application uses two codeNSManagedObjectContextcode instances. One belongs to the application delegate and has a persistent store coordinator attached to it. The other is a child of the main MOC and belongs to a codeClasscode object, called the codePhotoFetchercode. It uses codeNSPrivateQueueConcurrencyTypecode so all operations performed on this MOC take place in a background queue.p  pOur application downloads JSON data representing data about photographs from our API. In order to retrieve data from our API, the following sequence of steps takes placep  ol liConstruct an codeNSURLRequestcode object and use the codeNSURLConnectionDataDelegatecode protocol to construct the data returned from the request, or handle errors.li liOnce the download of the JSON data is complete, perform a block on the secondary MOCs queue that does the following ol liParse the JSON using codeNSJSONSerializationcode into Foundation class instances.li liIterate over the parsed data, inserting or updating entities in my background context as needed. Typically, this results in about 300 new or updated entities.li liSave the background context. This propagates my changes to the main MOC.li liPerform a block on the main MOC to save emitsem context. This is to have our data persisted to disk, a codeSQLitecode store. Finally, make a callback to a delegate informing them that the response has been fully inserted into the Core Data store.li olli ol  pThe code to save the background MOC looks something like thisp  precode[AppDelegate.managedObjectContext performBlock     [AppDelegate saveContext] A standard save call to the main MOC ] codepre  pWhen the main object context saves, its also saving a fair number of JPEGs that have been downloaded since the last time a main object context save occurred. Currently, on the iPhone 4, were downloading 15 200x200 JPEGs at 70 compression, or about 2MB of data in total.p  h1The Problemh1  pThis works, and works well. My problem is that once the background context saves, the codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode running in my view controller picks up the changes propagated up to the main MOC. It inserts new cells in our codePSTCollectionViewcode, an opensource clone of codeUICollectionViewcode. While its inserting new cells, the main context saves and writes those changes to disk. This can take, on an iPhone 4 running iOS 5.1, anywhere from 250350ms. p  pDuring that third of a second, the app is completely unresponsive. Animations that were in progress before the save are paused and no new user events are sent to the main run loop until the save completes.p  pI ran our app in Instruments using the Time Profiler to identify what is blocking our main thread.

We switched to smaller JPEGs and saw a performance boost. Then, we decreased the number of JPEGs we download at a time from 90 down to 15. This also lead to a significant performance boost. However, were still seeing 250350mslong blocks on the main thread.p  pThe first thing I tried was just getting rid of the background MOC to eliminate the possibility that it might be causing problems. In fact, it made things worse since our updateorcreate code was running on the main thread and causing overall animation performance to degrade.p  pChanging the persistent store to codeNSInMemoryStoreTypecode had no effect.p  pCan anyone point me to the secret sauce that will give me the UI performance that background managed object contexts have promisedp

Negative 317 pI have searched the internet and got absolutely no results for this. My ios app is just a simple navigation controller with a indexpath that should send the title of the row selected of a custom dynamic cell  to a uilabel. The catch is that the datasource is from mysql that is xml parsed in an nsarray called coolarray. The error happens just before moving to the next view and is in the log as strongTerminating app due to uncaught exception NSInvalidArgumentException, reason [NSDictionaryI isEqualToString] unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x8887670.strong However, it does give the nslog result of indexPathrow0 or 1 or whatever was selected. It must be a problem with the delivery of the array to the uilabel, but I cannot figure it out I have left out the code for the custom cell, because that isnt likely the reason for the error and works fine plus is dead simple.

Negative 317 pI am trying to develop an application in which a Beaglebone platform captures video images from a camera connected to it, and then send them through an internet socket to an Android application such the application shows the video images.p  pI have read that openCV may be a very good option to capture the images from a camera, but then I am not sure how the images can be sent through a socket.p  pOn the other end, I think that the video images received by the Android application could be treated by simple images. With this in mind I think I can refresh the image every second or so.p  pI am not sure if I am in the right way for the implementation, so I really appreciate any suggestion and help you could provide. p  pThanks in advance, Gus. p
Negative 317 pMy WPF window contains a Grid that stretches to the entire window width and layouts some controls along the way. Inmidst of these controls, there should be displayed some lines with arrows on one end, that visualise some kind of flow. The lines span across multiple grid columns or rows and have some margin to each sides, to keep them away from the other controls. Multiple lines have certain connection points where they must touch. For now, I only need horizontal and vertical lines.p  pIve tried with the Line control, but that seems to require X and Y coordinates for both ends, in pixels. Thats not easy because the line may stretch as the user changes the window size.p  pNext was the Path control, but I dont know how to add arrow ends there. The Path data was M0,0 L1,0 with StretchFill, so if I draw an arrow in the path, it would stretch as well, which I shouldnt do.p  pWhat alternatives are there to stretch a line but not the arrow on itp

Negative 317 pI noticed an odd memory increase in one of my Activities. Hence I ran a little test I opened the dialog multiple times open  close  open  close .... and the memory kept increasing. So I used the DDMS to dump an HPROF file and opened it in a hrefhttpwww.eclipse.orgmatMATa Memory analyzer. The leak suspect report indicated, that the main reason for the growing memory consumption was thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2s4KD.png altenter image description herep  pSo I did a histogramm, to check that dialog I ran my tests on and whats keeping it alive. Turns out, its kept alive by its strongAutoCompleteTextViewsstrong, which in turn are kept alive by strongandroid.widget.TextViewIClipboardDataPasteEventImpl.strong However there are no immediate dominators for IClipboardDataPasteEventImpl except of course the GC Root. I tried to find that IClipboardDataPasteEventImpl  on the internet and I searched grepcode the android source, but the only thing I could come up with was this a hrefhttpsplash5.blogspot.de201203galaxys2memoryleakwithtextview.htmlblog entrya. I cant read whatever language that is, but what I could read are the English words thrown in, which indicates, that it might be a bug on the Samsung Galaxy SII the phone I am using, running android 2.3.x, related to the ClipboardManager. However I am unsure of this I want to fix this, hence I am disinclined to simply accept it to be an unfixable bug and I have no clue, where this Clipboard is spawned and why.

Negative 317 pI have created a simple table tennis game in jquery. I have hosted on the server for the users to play the game. Now what I want to do is to analyse the statistics of the game. Basically what I want to do is to record the time for the users to complete the game and store them in the database and periodically perform the analysis like average time for completion, etc. Where I am getting stuck is how to control the execution of the javascript and starting a timer to record the time needed for game completion and at the end of the game passing it onp  por should I just add a timer in the game itself recording time and thereafter on completion it would pass on the data to server and update the databasep

By the way, bear in mind that codeParentidcode is strongnullablestrongp  h3What I need to doh3  pI want to enforce a check before inserting a new entity into the DB. Instead of catching an exception I want to fire a query but I think it reduces performance... to check if an entity with same name and parent of newcoming exists in order to throw a decent exception. Despite performance, its still a chance to learn something new about LINQ providersp  pIn plain old SQL I would dop  precodeSELECT Id FROM entity WHERE Name   AND Parentid   codepre  pand this correctly supports NULL idsp  h3What I tried and failed, otherwise I wouldnt be hereh3  precodevar exInput  from Entity entity in entityRepository.Query     where entity.Name.ToLowerInvariant  newEntity.Name.ToLowerInvariant         ampamp entity.Parent.EqualsnewEntity.Parent     select new  ParentName  entity.Parent  null  entity.Parent.Name  null .FirstOrDefault codepre  pI thought NHibernate could be smart enough to accept a null value as codenewEntity.Parentcode and also smart enough to read codeentity.Parent.Equalscode as an expression instead of a method call which fails in case of null.p  pAnyway thats not the problemp  h3The errorh3  precodeSystem.NotSupportedException Boolean EqualsSystem.Object codepre  pI know NHibernate LINQ is not a full LINQ provider and doesnt support all methods Entity Framework supports.

It is my opinion that if the operands of comparison are of the same identity we can simply match their ID and if one of the entities is codenullcode generate codeNULLcode identity in HQL.

Negative 317 pIm trying to sort a multidimensional array based the current active depth of the sorting function.  If it was sorting the first array it came into contact with, the active depth would be 0.  If the sorting the second, it would be 1, and so on and so forth.p  pMy basic array structure is as followsp  precodearr[year][monthName][dayNumber]  somelink codepre  pI am generating the array using regular expressions in a for loop of filenames.. That part isnt whats important.p  pAs to the specifics of the array structure.. codeyearcode is a numeric value, such as 2012 or 2013, codemonthNamecode is the name of a month, such as April or March, codedayNumbercode is of course the number of the day, zeropadded, and finally, codesomelinkcode contains html markup, which isnt really important at the moment.p  pGetting into the actual question.. a part of this script Im not going to showunless requested, uses the current structure of the array to create a listbased menu.  Starting today, the script started acting strange April was appearing before March, and the day 16 before 1.  I tried to fix this with the function below to little avail I cant really.. figure out the logic to get this to work.p  pThe expected output is for the years to be lowesttohighest, starting from the top, the months to be sorted the same way, though by their number instead of their name, and days to be sorted the same way as years.  The last link doesnt really matter here, I dont plan on sorting that.p  pExpected output illustratedlinks not shown to keep this shortp  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecode2012  March       1       15       16  April  May 2013  March       1  April       1       15       16 codepre  pHeres what Ive tried so farp  pre classlangphp prettyprintoverridecodefunction monsorta,b      if daten,strtotimea  daten,strtotimeb  return 0      return daten,strtotimea gt daten,strtotimeb  1  1  function menusortarr,depth      newarr  array     if depth  0          ksortarr          else if depth  1          uksortarr,monsort          else            foreach arr as key gt value          if isarrayvalue              depth             value  menusortvalue,depth                  newarr[key]  value          return newarr  codepre  pI should also note as per the codemonsortcode function, that the 11 in the ternary operator doesnt quite matter, as Ive tried it both ways and it fails each time, so that cant be the problem.p  pIn case in the above, I didnt really.. ask a question, Im wondering what Ive done wrong here, and what I need to do to fix it.p
Negative 317 pI am working with someone who is trying to achieve a loadbalancing behavior using JMS Queues with IBM Websphere MQ.  As such, they have multiple Camel JMS consumers configured to read from the same Queue.  Despite that this behavior is undefined according to the JMS spec last time I looked anyway, they expect a sort of roundrobin  loadbalancing behavior.  And, while the spec leaves this undefined, Im led to believe  that the normal behavior of Websphere MQ is to deliver the message to only one of the consumers, and that it emmayem do some type of loadbalancing.  See here, for example a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13800829whenmultimessageconsumerconnecttosamequeuewebspheremqhowtoloadbalanWhen multi MessageConsumer connect to same queueWebsphere MQ,how to load balance messageconsumerap  pBut in this particular case, it appears that embothem consumers are receiving the same message.p  pCan anyone who is more of an expert with Websphere MQ shed any light on this  Is there any situation where this behavior is expected Is there any configuration change that can alleviate thisp  pIm leaning towards telling everyone here to use the native Websphere MQ clustering facility and go away from having multiple consumers pointing at the same Queue, but that will be a big change for them, so Id love to discover a way to make this work.p  pNot that Im a fan of relying on anything thats undefined, but if theyre willing to rely on IBM specific behavior, Ill leave that up to them.p

Negative 317 pIm building a kiosk contest that will run on an iPad, and Ive built it so that once the form loads, it can run offline by storing each entry using localStorage. p  pEvery 15 minutes, the webpage will attempt to send the entries back to the server, and if successful, the local records will be deleted from localStorage.p  pNow to the crux of itp  pFor safety purposes, I cant have the iPad issue a delete command unless were absolutely certain the server received all of the records.p  pIf bandwidth was not an issue, I would simply have the server send back all of the records it received, the ipad would check the received data from the server against what it sent to the server, and if the two match, we can be confident the server received all of the records and empty the localStorage variable.p  pSince bandwidth is an issue, Im wondering if there is a way to generate a checksum on the data, send the data, have the .asp receiving file generate a checksum as well and just send the checksum back as a response.p  pSo I guess my question is, is there a way to generate a checksum in jQuery that can be duplicated in .ASPp  pThanks, Bp

Negative 317 pIve been working on a character recognition program in MATLAB for sometime now and asked a couple questions on stackoverflow and received good feedback. So I figured I would try my luck again.p  pProblem Im getting this error in my train of the network.p  pInput 1 size does not match net.inputs1.size.p  pIm using the pictures below. I want to train my network using picture 1 to recognize the contents in picture 2. Before I can train the network, I preprocess the images. I wrote a program to extract each letter in the image and convert the image into a binary matrix. For example, if my grid for each letter is 10x10 then in my first image I would have a 10x10x4 matrix and the second image 10x10x2.p  pSo now I have a target matrix 10x10x4 and an input matrix 10x10x2.p  pTo train the network I need to reshape each 10x10 layer in the images so that each layer is converted to a row using the  operator. So now the target matrix has a size of 4x100 and the input matrix a size of 2x100.p  pTraining Its my understanding that in order for the network to get trained to recognize the characters in the first image targets, I need to train the network with those targets. Thusly, I use the following code.p  precode[net, tr]  trainNNet100, train, targets codepre  pTo perform the actual recognition, I simulate the net for each row in my input matrix and record the outputs using indices. So I step through the input matrix rowwise using a forloop, simulate the network, and send the outputs to my findmatch function. This functions purpose is to find the rows in the targets where the input array matches. This is not really important to this error.p  precode[r c d]  sizeinput  for k  1d     input  inputk,     outputs  roundsimnet,input      [matched,k, ind,k]  findmatchoutputs, targets end codepre  pI would like to know why I keep getting error Input 1 size does not match net.inputs1.size. This program works fine if I have only one letter in the input image. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIlqGe.png alttargetsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdXtlN.png altinputp  pEdit I mentioned above that I used the  operator. This is a mistake. I use the following code to reshape the matrix into what I need.p  precode[r c d]  sizeinput C  permuteinput,[3 2 1] newinput  reshapeC,d,rc,1 codepre  pSo for example, given the following matrixp  precodeinput,,1  [1 23 4] input,,2  [5 67 8] input,,3  [9 1011 12] codepre  pYou would getp  precodenewinput  [1,2,3,45,6,7,89,10,11,12] codepre  pAlso, I made a mistake in stating that this works for one letter. This works for one letter strongonlystrong if I train the network with the letter I am wanting to recognize. I trained using,p  precode[net, tr]  trainNNet100, input, targets codepre  pwhere input is would be 1x100 for one letter.p

Negative 317 pDoes CloudBees offer any JMS hosting or any 3rd party JMS hosting like IronMQ After perusing their a hrefhttpwww.cloudbees.complatformecosystemtechpartners.cb relnofollowPartner Ecosystema pages and developers docs, I dont see anything of the sort.

When a result arrives, Monitor.PulseAll is called on the shared object, and all request threads check to see if their number is up.pli ol  pThere may be other options, but please ignore them for the purposes of this question.p  pstrongQuestion strong When there are lots of queuing threadsp  ul liIs either method significantly more CPU efficientli liIs either method significantly more Memory efficientli ul  pThe lock objects are just new object instances.p  pMy gut feeling is scenario 1 is more efficient, since only one thread will act when a pulse happens, and base object instances are very resourcelight right.

Negative 317 pI am working with WPF and the MVVM Light framework. In my project I have a codeGameViewModelcode and an associated view for it that acts as the main screen of my game this is not my main ViewModel. Within the GameView, I would like to dynamically display other UserControls, triggered by button clicks or something of that nature, at a certain location within the grid. Im not entirely sure how to go about this. I thought about using a secondary ViewModelLocator or something similar which I wouldnt be sure how to go about doing at all, but before I dove into that I thought Id ask here and see if there are any more practical ways to do this. p  pSay a button is clicked, UserControl1 is displayed at 3, 3 on the grid, then another button is clicked and UserControl2 is displayed at the same location. This is essentially what Im trying to accomplish. While it is not imperative, I would like to use as much XAML and as little codebehind as possible, but anything that gets the job done in an MVVMfriendly manner will work perfectly fine for me. Any advice that you could give would be greatly appreciated. Im guessing the solution is probably a lot easier than Im making it out to be... it usually is. p

Negative 317 pIn short Is there a supported way to create an Android project for eclipse as you would get via the new Android project wizard programmatically  Or if not supported, then is there any way at all  this is being done within an eclipse plugin p  pIve been trying to do this for a while, and it is turning out to be much more difficult than expected.  I took a look at the source for both the New and the Import wizards for Android projects, and found that they both use the NewProjectCreator class.  There seem to be two ways to use this class one is via the static create method, and the other is to construct an instance of NewProjectCreator and call createAndroidProjects.  However, Im having trouble getting ahold of all the necessary parameters for either of these.  The static method requires both an IAndroidTarget and a ProjectPopulator, neither of which I can find implementations of There is an anonymous implementation of ProjectPopulator in the NewProjectWizard class, but pasting this into my code is disastrous in the number of classes and fields it cant find.  The instance method on the other hand requires an IWizardContainer, but I would like to be able to do this without bringing up a wizard.p  pAt the other end of the spectrum, Ive tried simply adding and Android nature to the project, but this causes all sorts of build errors, since it doesnt actually change the setup of the project to reflect whatever the Android standards are.  I guess another option is to take this route and try to set up the whole project manually, but I dont know if there are any guidelines for this, or whether the project standards are likely to change.p  pDoes anyone know how to do this  Thanks in advancep

But as you know, the two functions really differ in how they can update their parameters.p  pCan someone explains to mep  hr  pstrongEDITstrongbr I think I didnt interpret my question well. What I really care is why C doesnt allow these two functions simultaneously as different function since they are really different as to whether parameter can be written or not. Intuitively, it should bep  hr  pstrongEDITstrongbr The nature of empass by valueem is actually empass by coping argument values to parameter valuesem. Even for emreferencesem and empointersem where thee copied values are emaddressesem. From the callers viewpoint, whether emconstem or emnonconstem is passed to the function does not influence values and of course types of copied to parameters.br The distinction between strongtoplevel conststrong and stronglowlevel conststrong matters when copying objects. More specifically, strongtoplevel conststrongnot the case of stronglowlevel conststrong is ignored when copying objects since copying wont influence the copied object. It is immaterial whether the object copied to or copied from is emconstem or not.br So for the caller, differentiating them is not necessary. Likely, from the function viewpoint, the emtoplevel constem parameters doesnt influence the interface andor the functionality of function. The two function actually accomplish the same thing.

Negative 317 pfirst of all Id like to say thanks. Although Im still pretty new to it, Ive learned nearly everything I know about Access from this site. This is one of the most helpful forums Ive ever used.p  pIm having a problem importing data to my Access database from my Excel spreadsheet. I keep getting a key violation saying a particular field column in each row was deleted. I have two tables on my database and two coinciding sheets on my spreadsheet. Both sheets have this particular field. Sheet1 is importing fine, but Access wont import anything from that field on sheet2. All the properties for this field are the same and the data preview during import verifies that the data is coming from both sheets in the same form.p  pFrom this source a hrefhttpwww.utteraccess.comforumKeyViolationsAppendQt1918322.html relnofollowhttpwww.utteraccess.comforumKeyViolationsAppendQt1918322.htmla Key violations occur for 3 reasonsp  p1 when the record you are attempting to add to the table adds a duplicate value where the field does not allow duplicates  This cant be it because every value in the field is unique and the field is set to allow duplicate values. And my primary key is the Accessgenerated replication ID.p  p2 when the record has a field value that is null and the field in the table is a required field  the field on sheet1 is adding null values, and not all the values on sheet2 that wont add are null value. and the fields are set to accept null values.p  p3 Where a value is added that is not in a related table and referential integrity is set on the link between the tables  I have no relationships set in my database yet.p  pI have done this import successfully before a few times and Ive only made minor changes since then, the majority of which on the Excel file. Thanks for any replies, and thanks very much for any explanations.p

Negative 317 pI believe this is very simple, but I have spent a while Googling and looking at available API and I have not found a solution yet.  p  pI simply need to get a data element a double, in this case from a known SQL table, when I know the Column and Row to get the data from, into my C code.  For simplicity, lets say my table has 3 columns ProductID, Price, and Weight.  I have access in my C code to the ProductID, and I made a string which is the ProductID.  Now I simply need to get that ProductIDs corresponding Price into a double in my C code.p  pI am brand new to SQL, but I believe a pseudoquery would be something likep  precodeSELECT Price FROM tablename WHERE ProductIDid codepre  pNot too worried about the query but I would appreciate help with that as well.  I just really need to know how to make a double in C equal to that specific data element in the SQL table.  It should be dead simple, but I am making it harder than it is.  Here is some of the C code so farp  precodeSqlCommand sqlcommand  new SqlCommandSELECT Price FROM tablename WHERE ProductIDid double ItemPrice  sqlcommand.GetData codepre

Negative 317 pIn my previous question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18168040forloopfunctionsinpythonnoredirect1comment2663598518168040For Loop Functions in Pythona, I had trouble with putting functions that contained a command to draw a line for a hangman game. It didnt exactly draw the line, and I first suspected it was a problem with the for loop or the functions. Now I realize there is somewhat a glitch with Pygame.p  pI have tried solving the problem by using this code in the country, CANADAp  precodeb2  font.renderstrletters[1], True, red screen.blitb2, bPosition if hangman1x  500 and hangman1y  500     hangman1x  775, 250     hangman1y  775, 50     pygame.draw.linescreen, black, hangman1x, hangman1y, 5     pygame.display.flip     time.sleep0.5     bPosition  500, 500     b1.x, b1.y  500, 500 if hangman1x  775, 250 and hangman1y  775, 50     print hi     width  6     pygame.draw.linescreen, black, hangman1x, hangman1y, 5     print yay     pygame.display.flip codepre  pNow heres the weird thing.p  pWhen you press the B blitted onto the screen, it turns red, like its meant to, draws the line perfectly fine, but disappears, when the B disappears, and I understand why. After that, I added that extra if code. Notice that both codepygame.draw.linecodes are the same,  It prints hi and yay in the shell, but it does not keep the line. Anyway to solve thisp

There are 61  strong120strong options for that, we will need to test them all and return the shortest route founded. So it will look something like thatCities names are A, B, C, D, E, Fp  ul liOption 1  A  B  C  D  E  F  Ali liOption 2  A  B  C  D  strongFstrong  strongEstrong  Ali liOption 3  A  strongCstrong  strongBstrong  D  E  F  Ali liOption 4  A  strongCstrong  strongBstrong  D  strongFstrong  strongEstrong  Ali li.li li.li listrongOption 120strongli ul  pNow I am saying that after calculating option 1 and 2, you can skip over options 3 and 4. How do you do that Its simple When calculating option 1 you need to calculate what will be the shortest route starting from City D, finishing in City A, and going thru cities E, F, it actually calculating options 1 and 2. What we want to do is to build a map of 4 cities where we force what would be the first and the last city, in this example when calculating option 1 you create a map of D,E,F,A that holds the data of what would be the shortest path from D to A thru E,F. So now when you start calculating options 3 and 4 you can stop when reaching City D, because you already know what would be the shortest route starting at city D, finishing in City A and going thru cities E, F.p  pThis is the principle that I used in my algorithm. I run a brute algorithm and mapped all the sub results, strongthose results are not sub routesstrong, do not confuse there. They are just part of calculation that need to be done in order to find the shortest route. So each time I recognize I am doing the same calculation I used a solution from a map.p  pHere is an output of my algorithm running over 19 cities.

Here is the list of what I gotp  pColumn 1 is N, column 2 is my algorithm efficiency compare, column 3 is dynamic programming algorithm compare and column 4 is my algorithm efficiency multiply N compare.p  precode7   2.55769     2.72222     2.98397  8   2.40601     2.61224     2.74973  9   2.31562     2.53125     2.60507  10  2.2582      2.46913     2.50912  11  2.21972     2.42        2.44169  12  2.19258     2.38016     2.39191  13  2.17251     2.34722     2.35356  14  2.15701     2.31952     2.32293  15  2.14456     2.29591     2.29774  16  2.13424     2.27555     2.27652  17  2.12548     2.25781     2.25832  18  2.1179      2.24221     2.24248  19  2.11124     2.22839     2.22853  20  2.10533     2.21606     2.21614  21  2.10003     2.205       2.20503  22  2.09525     2.19501     2.19503  23  2.09091     2.18595     2.18596  24  2.08696     2.17769     2.17769  25  2.08333     2.17013     2.17014  26  2.08        2.1632      2.1632  27  2.07692     2.1568      2.1568  28  2.07407     2.15089     2.15089  29  2.07142     2.1454      2.1454  30  2.06896     2.1403      2.1403  31  2.06666     2.13555     2.13555  32  2.06451     2.13111     2.13111  33  2.0625      2.12695     2.12695  34  2.0606      2.12304     2.12304  35  2.05882     2.11937     2.11937  36  2.05714     2.11591     2.11591  37  2.05555     2.11265     2.11265  38  2.05405     2.10956     2.10956  39  2.05263     2.10664     2.10664  40  2.05128     2.10387     2.10387  41  2.05        2.10125     2.10125  42  2.04878     2.09875     2.09875  43  2.04761     2.09637     2.09637  44  2.04651     2.0941      2.0941  45  2.04545     2.09194     2.09194  46  2.04444     2.08987     2.08987  47  2.04347     2.0879      2.0879  48  2.04255     2.08601     2.08601  49  2.04166     2.0842      2.0842  50  2.04081     2.08246     2.08246  51  2.04        2.0808      2.0808  52  2.03921     2.0792      2.0792  53  2.03846     2.07766     2.07766  54  2.03773     2.07618     2.07618  55  2.03703     2.07475     2.07475  56  2.03636     2.07338     2.07338  57  2.03571     2.07206     2.07206  58  2.03508     2.07079     2.07079  59  2.03448     2.06956     2.06956  60  2.03389     2.06837     2.06837  61  2.03333     2.06722     2.06722  62  2.03278     2.06611     2.06611  63  2.03225     2.06503     2.06503  64  2.03174     2.06399     2.06399  65  2.03125     2.06298     2.06298  66  2.03076     2.06201     2.06201  67  2.0303      2.06106     2.06106  68  2.02985     2.06014     2.06014  69  2.02941     2.05925     2.05925  70  2.02898     2.05839     2.05839  71  2.02857     2.05755     2.05755  72  2.02816     2.05673     2.05673  73  2.02777     2.05594     2.05594  74  2.02739     2.05516     2.05516  75  2.02702     2.05441     2.05441  76  2.02666     2.05368     2.05368  77  2.02631     2.05297     2.05297  78  2.02597     2.05228     2.05228  79  2.02564     2.05161     2.05161  80  2.02531     2.05095     2.05095  81  2.025       2.05031     2.05031  82  2.02469     2.04968     2.04968  83  2.02439     2.04907     2.04907  84  2.02409     2.04848     2.04848  85  2.0238      2.0479      2.0479  86  2.02352     2.04733     2.04733  87  2.02325     2.04678     2.04678  88  2.02298     2.04624     2.04624  89  2.02272     2.04571     2.04571  90  2.02247     2.04519     2.04519  91  2.02222     2.04469     2.04469  92  2.02197     2.04419     2.04419  93  2.02173     2.04371     2.04371  94  2.0215      2.04324     2.04324  95  2.02127     2.04277     2.04277  96  2.02105     2.04232     2.04232  97  2.02083     2.04188     2.04188  98  2.02061     2.04144     2.04144  99  2.0204      2.04102     2.04102  100 2.0202      2.0406      2.0406  codepre  pSee how column 3 and 4 are almost the same.

Negative 317 pI use addTextChangeListener to filter a list items. When the user enters a character on the editText, items are filtered based on user input. For example, if the user enters stackoverflow, all items that contains stackoverflow are displayed.

The first being that I simply use the Makefile generated by Rice to install the shared object automatically into a standard directory that is already on LOADPATH. Super easy no hassle.

My codep  precodepublic boolean[] partycheck         Date dateET  new DatepartydateET.getYear, partydateET.getMonth, partydateET.getDayOfMonthDate is deprecated,         but easy to handle         this is used to test the date contained in the datepicker, partydateET.

I could say that if time  0000, then dont run, or use a listener to check if it has changed,             using a boolean value. But this would not really benefit the task much, so I havent. It would also             take more coding, and more complex coding.         else             returnarray[2]  true                  ifpartyvenueET.getText.length  0             returnarray[3]  false             returnarray[0]  false         else             returnarray[3]  true                  return returnarray         returnarray[0]  1st value in array  is used as toggle as to whether the party is ready or not.         returnarray[14] are used to indicate to the user which textbox is empty has a problem.         codepre  pHowever it does not do what I expect it to do when I return the boolean array.

Negative 317 pIf I add codeCProgram Files x86WinMergecode to the User codePATHcode variableby right click on computer  advanced system settings  environmental variables, once I open a new cmd shell WinmergeU.exe is not recognized. If I add that path to the System codePATHcode variable, WinmergeU.exe is correctly recognized instead. I though there was no difference between User and System, beside the fact that if I set it on System all the users will see it, while the User codePATHcode is local. Am I doing something wrong p  pEDIT 1p  pIn the follow you can see first the case in which codeCProgram Files x86WinMergecode is added to the System codePATHcode variable but not to the User, then when it is added to the User codePATHcode variable but not to the System. In the first case Winmerge window launch correctly not shown and as you can see the path is shown by the echo PATH command. In the second case it does not launch and the path it is not shown by echo PATH. note that I clearly confirmed with OK and closed the environmental variable windows before taking these screenshots, and I opened a new cmd right after changing PATH and pressing ok.

Negative 317 pstrongTLDR, The questionstrongp  pWhat effect on the execution of code can the presence of an extension method have in .NET e.g. JIToptimizationsp  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pIm experiencing a test failure in MSTest that depends on whether a seemingly unrelated assembly is also tested. p  pI noticed the test failure and by accident noticed that the failure only occured if another test assembly was loaded. Running mstest on both the Unittests and Integration test assemblies would start executing the integration tests and fail on the 21st integration test under the 4.5 CLR, whereas this does not happen under the 4.0 CLR same configuration otherwise.  I removed all the tests but the failing one from the integration test assembly. Execution now looks like this with both test assemblies loaded, mstest loads both assemblies then executes the single test in the integration test assembly, which fails.p  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecodegt mstest.exe testcontainerUnittests.dll testcontainerIntegrationTests.dll  Loading CProjTestsbinx86ReleaseUnittests.dll...

Results               Top Level Tests                 Passed                Proj.IntegrationTest.IntegrationTest21 codepre  pI thought it must be an code[AssemblyInitialize]code thing being executed on the UnitTests dll, or perhaps a some sort of static state in the Unittest.dll or a common dependency being modified when the test assembly was loaded. I find neither any static constructors nor assembly init in the Unittests.dll. I suspected a deployment difference when the Unittests assembly was included, dependent assembly deployed in different version etc. but I compared the passingfailing deployment dirs and they are binary equivalent.p  pSo what part of the Unittests assembly is causing the test difference From the unit tests I removed half the tests at a time until I drilled it down to a source file in the Unit tests assembly. Along with the test class, an extension method is declaredp  pApart from this extension class the Unittest assembly now contains a single test case in a dummy test class. The test failure occurs only if I have a dummy test method emandem the extension method declared. I could remove all of the remaining test logic until the Unittest dll is a single file, containing thisp  precode DummyTest.cs in Unittests.dll [TestClass] public class DummyTest      [TestMethod]     public void TestNothing             public static class IEnumerableExtension     public static IEnumerableltTgt SymmetricDifferenceltTgt        this IEnumerableltTgt this,                 IEnumerableltTgt that            return this.Exceptthat.Concatthat.Exceptthis      codepre  pIf either the test method emorem the extension class is removed, the test passes. Both present, and the test fails.p  pThere are no calls to the extension method made from either assembly, and no code is executed in the Unittests assembly before the integration tests are executed as far as Im aware. p  pIm sure the integration test is complex enough that JIT differences in optimization can cause a difference e.g. in floating point. Is that what Im seeing p

Negative 317 pI have a plugin architecture and I want to code against it, but I want each plugin to have its own solution in its own folder space.  Rather than build the framework assembly and toss it into each plugin directory, I thought it might be a good idea to fake the framework assembly Im coding against a couple of interfaces and some exception classes and store that in source control as long as I did not change the interfaces I was coding against, all should be good.  I think.p  pIs this a bad idea  I have many developers creating plugins, and they are storing them on their local machines in different places with relation to the framework project it makes source control management annoying.  I dont want to commit a .dll to source control though, as it is actively being developed against not this plugin interface though.p  pIt seemed this would be a good way to use Fakes, but I cant find any examples of how to do it, so maybe Im creating more problems than Im solvingp

Negative 317 pIve been wanting to experiment with platforming physics using freeglut, but before I would allow myself to start, I had an old problem to take care of.p  pYou see, I want to write a reshape handler that not only maintains the scale and eliminates any distortion of the view, but also allows all of the onscreen shapes to maintain their size even while the window is too small to contain them i.e. let them be clipped.p  pIve almost got all three parts solved, but when I scale my window, the circle I have drawn onto it scales strongjust slightlystrong. Otherwise, I got the clipping, and I have eliminated the distortion. emUpdateem What I want to achieve is a program that maintains scale and aspect ratio strongindependent of window sizestrong.p  pHeres my codep  precodevoid reshapeint nwidth,int nheight      glViewport0,0,nwidth,nheight     glMatrixModeGLPROJECTION     glLoadIdentity      here begins the code     double bound  1.5     double aspect  doublenwidthnheight      so far, I get the best results by normalizing the dimensions     double norm  sqrtboundboundaspectaspect     double invnorm  sqrtboundbound1aspect1aspect      ifnwidth lt nheight         glOrthoboundinvnorm,boundinvnorm,boundaspectinvnorm,boundaspectinvnorm,1,1     else         glOrthoboundaspectnorm,boundaspectnorm,boundnorm,boundnorm,1,1      without setting the modelview matrix to the identity form,     the circle becomes an oval, and does not clip when nheight gt nwidth     glMatrixModeGLMODELVIEW     glLoadIdentity  codepre  pemUpdateem As per Mr. Colemans suggestion, Ive tried switching out single precision for double. The scaling issue has improved along the vertical axis, but whenever I drag the horizontal axis in either direction, the shape still scales by a noticeable amount. Its still the same shape throughout, but a visual inspection tells me that the shape is not the same size when the window is 150x300 as it is when the window is 600x800, regardless of which glOrtho is being executed.p

Negative 317 pI got the sample Android project from the QuickBlox server and Checked in Android device. I got over all picture of the How to use the Sdk and other API in the Android application. I have some basic query, Please find below and clarify.p  p1 I can run and test the sample application and able to chat between two user, But whenever I run the application I need to login the user to start a chat, If i commented the login API after first time login, when I click on the any user to chat, it throws exception called Unauthorized user. So is there any way to store the login credential in the App and use it for next time, Since once user logged in they dont need to login again until they manually logged out.  p  p2 All the API required Access token, which is created after initializing the application, I read that It will expired in less than 2 hrs I hope. So is there any API like, the Access token auto created whenever user using the application. Or we need to manually call the Initialize API to get the token. If thats the case How to we know if the Previous token expiredp  p3 If one user not logged in, If another user trying to send a message to that user they are not receiving messages even after logged in. So how to handle this scenario p  p4 Is there any other way apart from Storing the Message in Custom Object for maintaining message history. Since using this custom object, I need to call the API for storing message details in the Custom Object whenever user send the message, I feel Its costly process, Since I need to manually call the API to add in the custom object, and again I need manually retrieve the data from custom object to display to other user.p  pKindly clarify the above questions.p  pGreat Thanks,p  pLakshmanan P.p

Negative 317 pi have a table in mysql which has a data type of timestamp as one of the columns, which gets a default value of CURRENTTIME upon insertion.  and i have another timestamp column that has a default value of CURRENTTIME upon update. i have these so that timestamp columns will get updated automatically on insertion and update which works fine.p  pnow i am using cxf, hibernatejpa, mysql, jackson to build a web service. i am simply creating a new record and retrieving it right away as below code shows.p  precodeSession session  getSession   sessionFactory.getCurrentSession String accountId  Stringsession.saveaccount Account newAccount  Accountsession.loadAccount.class, accountId logger.infocreated timestamp  newAccount.getCreatedTimestamp codepre  pafter above code is ran, i can see that new record is created in mysql with correct timestamps for createdTimestamp. however, logger.info line above throws an exception because newAccount.getCreatedTimestamp returns null. if i remove logger.info line, i can see that newAccount object is populated with correct values except for createdTimestamp which is null.p  pwhats more odd is that after above code is ran which is a part of HTTP POST operation, i call a HTTP GET service which just fetches a record that i just inserted by doingp  precodesession.getAccount.class, accountId codepre  pand it correctly shows timestampsp  pi tried to sleep before session.load or session.get thinking that there might be a delay in inserting timestamp, but that didnt do much.  is there something special about hibernate session management that does not retrieve columns that mysql generates what am i missing here please help. p

Negative 317 pWe are using Bcyrpt implementation that comes with Spring securityv 3.1.3 on our web application. We have a limited number of users that have their password encrypted using bcryptwe are still testing it. p  pWhen these users login to our site, it usually takes about 0.8 seconds for the user entered password to be encrypted we use log rounds of 12 used for the encryption. At times we see the time spiking to more than 5 minutes. p  pAt first we assumed it was related to the amount of traffic on our web servers but there are a number of scenarios where the traffic is similar and no performance issue was shown. We even had cases where bcrypt was very slow on offpeak hours. This performance issue is random and could not find any explanation why it is happening. p  pOne additional point to mention is that I couldnt recreate this issue in local environment. p  pOur production system uses Java 7, with tomcat servers being our app servers with Linux OS.p  pI am not sure where to look anymore. Any suggestions or ideas to debug this differently would be very welcome.  p  pThank you p

Negative 317 pIm creating an application that provides a visual representation of nodes and lines connecting them together. Both nodes and lines are represented by custom QWidgets, WidgetNode and WidgetLine, say.p  pIve implemented WidgetLine as a transparent widget that is large enough to contain the start and end point of the line, and a custom function to draw the line itself.p  pI would like it so that if the user clicks on or right next to the line then the WidgetLine receives focus, but if they click further away from the line but still over the rectangular area covered by WidgetLines geometry then the click is completely ignored by WidgetLine and passed on to the widget below.p  pI first tried doing this with a custom codefocusInEventcode function on WidgetLine, but found the mouse clicks werent propagating below. I then tried setting the focus policy to codeQtNoFocuscode and using a custom codemousePressEventcode using codesetFocuscode to manually set the focus when appropriate, but the mouse events are still not being propagated to widgets above even when I call codeignorecode on them.p  pFinally, Ive tried installing an event filter to reject mouse events, with this event filter functionp  precodebool WidgetLineFiltereventFilterQObject object, QEvent event      assertobject  mCord     if eventgttype  QEventMouseButtonPress              QMouseEvent e  dynamiccastltQMouseEventgtevent         asserte         if e                      QPoint mouseRelativeToParent  mCordgtmapToParentegtpos              calculate distance of mouse click to patch cord             QLineF linemCordgtline             float distance  distanceFromPointToLineQVector2Dline.p1, QVector2Dline.p2, QVector2DmouseRelativeToParent             qDebug ltlt distance             const float distanceThreshold  2.f             if distance lt distanceThreshold                              qDebug ltlt consuming mouse click for focus                 mCordgtsetFocusQtMouseFocusReason                 return true                          else                 qDebug ltlt mousepressevent too far for focus                 return QObjecteventFilterobject, event                                return false  codepre  pBut this still does not propagate the mouse events to the parent on the mousepressevent too far for focus case.

Negative 317 pIm a bit stuck with my graph problem and, not being an expert on the subject, I thought Id turn to the internet for help. I have two graphs A and B and I want to check whether B is a subgraph of A. I tried to do this with igraph but it seems to be claiming that B is a subgraph of A, even when it is not. Here is an example that illustrates thisp  precodefrom igraph import   def funcg1, g2, e1, e2     if g1.es[e1][color]  g2.es[e2][color]         return True     else         return False   a  Graph4, directedTrue a.addedge0,1,color1 a.addedge1,2,color1 a.addedge2,3,color1 a.addedge0,2,color2 a.addedge2,0,color2 a.addedge1,3,color2 a.addedge3,1,color2  b  Graph2, directedTrue b.addedge0,1,color1 b.addedge0,1,color2 b.addedge1,0,color2  t  a.getsubisomorphismsvf2 otherb, edgecompatfnfunc print t codepre  pThe program prints [[0, 2], [1, 3]]p  pI would think that B is not a subisomorphism of A because the color1 line from vertex 0 does not connect to vertex 2 but igraph seems to ignore this. Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug in igraph Im using pythonigraph 0.6.5 with Python 2.6.5p  pEdit I think that color can be ignored here. My problem is that in graph A there is a link from the 0th vertex to the 1st vertex so B is not a subgraph because that would require that in graph A the 0th vertex connects directly to the 2nd vertex.p  pEdit2 I suspect what I really want is a induced subgraph isomorphism. p

Negative 317 pI am going over some interview preparation material and I was wondering what the best way to solve this problem would be if the characters in the String or array can be unicode characters. If it they were strictly ascii, you could make an codeintcode array of size 256 and map each ascii character to an index and that position in the array would represent the number of occurrences. If the string has unicode characters is it still possible to do so, i.e. does the unicode character a reasonable size that you could represent it using the indexes of a integer array Since unicode characters can be more than 1 byte in size, what data type would you use to represent them What would be the most optimal solution for this case p

Negative 317 pIm performing logical delete when an item should be deleted from the database.p  pI have added an additional codeDateTimecode column to every table that we need to perform logical delete.

Negative 317 pIve got a Samsung RF711 Core i7 laptop running Debian Wheezy with an integrated usb Multi Flash Reader, but this question could apply to any system with an sd card reader on an usb port. Heres what lsusb saysp  blockquote   pBus 004 Device 004 ID 058f6366 Alcor Micro Corp. Multi Flash Readerp blockquote  pI want to use an old sd card and solder some wires onto it to allow it to communicate with a PIC via SPI when I plug it into the sd card port.p  pIm aware that the sd card voltages are 3.3v and that a voltage level converter would be needed to interface with a 5v SPI device.p  pI compiled a custom kernel to produce the spidev kernel module, now what I know its something to do with udev rules, usbmodeswitch but I cant see the wood for the trees.p  pIdeally the solution would be a program, lets call it sdcardspi. When the program starts it flips the drivers and creates an spidev device in dev. When it quits it restores the slot functionality to be able to read sdcards once more. It could be a daemon process  starting it converts the slot, stopping it converts the slot back to being an sd card reader.p  pIt seems like something the writers of spidev could easily do, as sd cards are initially probed in SPI mode.p  pJust to be clear, I want to open the sd card reader in SPI mode, so no card is detected and I can do SPI communication using an spidev device node, say devspidev.0.p

Negative 317 pI am relatively new to iOS development and have a question. I have the need to send a multi part SMS message. I understand that I can just take the long message and pass that into the MFMessageComposeViewController and it will break everything up for me accordingly. However, that will not work, because every message that I send has a specific delimiter and I need every single one of the messages to begin with that identical delimiter. So, what I have tried to do is use a for loop, and display each controller after the other. However, my MfMessageComposeViewController for the other message parts is not being displayed, it only shows the initial message. The warning that is displayed in the terminal is thisp  pAttempt to present lt MFMessageComposeViewController 0x126819200 on lt ViewController 0x12660ae80 which is waiting for a delayed presention of lt MFMessageComposeViewController 0x12683b200 to completep  pAny suggestions I tried using code blocks and synchronizing everything so that each Controller would be displayed in a synchronized fashion, however that did not work.

Negative 317 pThis question is very similar to some other questions that have been posted on here, but nonetheless, it does not seem to work when I implement previously suggested solutions.  I am writing what should be some simple software that can be used to read in one column or multiple columns of data from a .txt file in a function and pass it to the main program for further calculations.  The function call passes the file name to the function and reads in the data.  Since this version only reads in one columns of data I could use a return function for this specific example, but I plan on expanding this to read in multiple columns of data so that is why I am using a void function. The column of test data is shown below.p  precode103.816   43.984   2214.5     321.5      615.8      8.186     37.6  codepre  pThe for loop in the function ReadFile reads back the data from the file perfectly indicating that the function works fine and properly reads in the data.  However, when I try to display the same data using the same for loop in the main program i get an EXECBADACCESS fault.  To be clear the program compiles fine, but it is not passing the data to the main program, which indicates a pointer problem.

Negative 317 pIm using codeangularjscode and I cant get the following controller to save to a scope variable the data returned from an codeAJAXcode request to Flickr.  The codehttp.getcode makes a call to a locally saved json file.  Upon success, it uses the json returned in codesuccesscode to determine the appropriate url for the AJAX call to the Flickr API.  Upon success of that call, I log the data to the console.  So far so good, it returns an array of three objects.  However, Im trying to set that array to a scope variable codescope.photoscode so I can iterate over it my view template.  However, when I try outputing codephotoscode in the html there is nothing.  I suspect this is a promise issue, and the template is rendering before the AJAX returns the data from Flickr, but Ive been pouring over the docs with no success looked at codeqcode a little.  Im somewhat new to Angular and would appreciate your insight.

Negative 317 pIm developing an BLE app, based on the Gatt sample project provided by google a hrefhttpsdeveloper.android.comsamplesBluetoothLeGattindex.html relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.android.comsamplesBluetoothLeGattindex.htmla. So, I can send data writing in a characteristic successfully. Now I need to know when this characteristic change its value. I understand that I need to implement the setCharacteristicNotification method and the onDescriptorWrite method. But I cant do that this works. Searching, I found some ideas about that a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions17910322androidbleapigattnotificationnotreceivedAndroid BLE API GATT Notification not receiveda, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20907411whatarethestepstogetnotifiedbybluetoothlowenergybledeviceWhat are the steps to get notified by Bluetooth Low Energy BLE devicea, but still no luck I dont understand how it works, what parameter I need define or what I need to do. Some good soul can share me a complete project that do this. All that I need is visualize the value of the characteristic when the BLE device returns some data.p  pI read the official Android documentation, but it is not so specific about that.

Negative 317 pI have a codeContainerViewModelcode which inherits codeConductorltTgt.Collection.AllActivecode and a codePanelViewModelcode which inherits codeScreencode and whose lifetime is controlled by codeContainerViewModelcodep  pMy codeContainerViewcode uses a codetemplatedcode codeItemsControlcode to render a my codeCollectionltTgtcode managed by the conductor.

Negative 317 pI am using Twitter digits with an iOS app, and when the users signs in with digits, the callback passes back a DGTSession object, with authenticationToken and authenticationTokenSecret NSString properties. After reading the documentation, I know that I can use the endpoint codeaccountverifycredentialcode to verify these tokens. This endpoint requires authentication, and I read from a post twittercommunity.com that I need to Use the consumer key provided by TwitterKit, and the Digits tokens to sign the request. I know that the consumer is for the application, and I can get it with code[Twitter sharedInstance].authConfig.consumerKeycode What I am confused about is signing the request. Does signing a request mean setting HTTP Header values All I want to do is verify the authentication token and secret that is saved in the iOS Keychain.p

When it finds a Match, I want to create a new file with the Match as the name. If the code finds another file with the same Match the file already exists then create a new page within that document. p  pRight now the code works, however instead of adding a new page, it overwrites the first page of the document.

Negative 317 pstrongSSIS   Support of Multiple versions of our productstrongp  pOur Enterprise Data warehouse consolidates data from multiple data sources. We have a requirement that we should be able to support data collection from different version of these data sources at the same time. p  pEx. Customer has three different versions of our product installed 7.3, 7.3.1 and 7.3.2. The data warehouse would in this case would be on version 7.3.2, but should be able to collect data from prior versions of the data sources.p  pWe use stored procedures to collect data from sources into our staging area and then we transform and load it on to the warehouse. The design of SSIS packages are that, there is one main package that executes packages for each table that we collect data from the source. The main package is invoked per source that we need to collect data from, if there are three sources at run time there will be three instances of the main package running. These packages run on the warehouse machine to pull the data from the source system.p  pWe would like to maintain one version of these packages on the warehouse and support collecting data from different source versions. p  pChallengesp  ul liThe signature of stored procedures on the source system has changed between versions  li liThere are some additional fields returned by these stored procedures in the newer releaseli ul  pExamplep  blockquote   p7.3 version signature  [dbo].[PDWGetMediaAgentSummary]LastVersionID AS BIGINT,   InitializeDays as INT  60, NextVersionID AS BIGINT OUTPUTp      p7.3 Sp1 version signature  [dbo].[PDWGetMediaAgentSummary]LastVersionID AS BIGINT,   DataStartDate AS DateTime23, NextVersionID AS BIGINT OUTPUTp blockquote  pAlso, let us say in 7.3 this stored procedure returned 8 fields and 7.3 sp1 it is returning 10 fields.p  pThe way we are trying to accommodate is to use SQLCmd from variable option in the OLE DB source to cover the signature difference, but this option does not allow us to bind parameters to variables to get the output value. The second issue of additional fields or the lack of additional fields from the 7.3 procedure, we tried to turned off the metadata validation, but we get field not found error at run time when we run the SSIS package against 7.3 version. Looks like the only way we could solve is to duplicate the data flow tasks, based on the source version. Looking for better way to do this, since this could go out of control as the number of releases increases.p  pAppreciate help on thisp
Negative 317 pI am currently having an issue with my login flow.

Negative 317 pI find the import path in ES6 modules very confusing when using it in Ember CLI.  For example, if I want to import a model deep in my application, I end up doing something like thisp  precodeimport User from ..........modelsuser codepre  pThis is an exercise of trial and error, as its hard to easily visualize how deep in the folder tree Im using this from.  Even worse, if I refactor my files, everything breaks.p  pSo alternatively, I can use an absolute path like thisp  precodeimport User from appnamemodelsuser codepre  pI prefer not to hardcode the app name into the path, because it can change.p  pIs there a shorthand to specify the app rootp  pcode.code doesnt work because code.code implies current path.p  precodeimport User from .modelsuser codepre

Negative 317 pThis question may sound a little silly and unusual, but pardon me, as I havent been able to figure out the reason behind the problem. Just a simple case, I start a non UI fragment from onCreate method of an activity, everything works fine.

So, the question arises if theres a certain callback in an activity that I should use to commit fragment transactions. p  pThe code for fragment transactions try in a sample project  p  precode    Fragment frag     frag  new DownloadFragment     FragmentTransaction fr  getFragmentManager.beginTransaction     fr.addfrag, FR     fr.commit codepre  pwhere DownloadFragment is a non UI fragment in which I return null from onCreateView.p  pAny help would be appreciated, as I have gone through the developer docs for Fragment already.p

Negative 317 pI am making a simple game in SpriteKit, and I have a scrolling background. What simply happens is that a few background images are placed adjacent to each other when the game scene is loaded, and then the image is moved horizontally when it scrolls out of the screen. Here is the code for that, from my game scenes codedidMoveToViewcode method.p  precode self.gameSpeed is 1.0 and gradually increases during the game  let backgroundTexture  SKTextureimageNamed Background var moveBackground  SKAction.moveByXself.frame.size.width, y 0, duration 20  self.gameSpeed var replaceBackground  SKAction.moveByXself.frame.size.width, y 0, duration 0 var moveBackgroundForever  SKAction.repeatActionForeverSKAction.sequence[moveBackground, replaceBackground]  for var iCGFloat  0 i lt 2 i      var background  SKSpriteNodetexture backgroundTexture     background.position  CGPointx self.frame.size.width  2  self.frame.size.width  i, y CGRectGetMidYself.frame     background.size  self.frame.size     background.zPosition  100     background.runActionmoveBackgroundForever      self.addChildbackground  codepre  pNow I want to increase the speed of the scrolling background at certain points of the game. You can see that the duration of the backgrounds horizontal scroll is set to code20  self.gameSpeedcode. Obviously this does not work, because this code is only run once, and therefore the movement speed is never updated to account for a new value of the codeself.gameSpeedcode variable.p  pSo, my question is simply how do I increase the speed reduce the duration of my background images movements according to the codeself.gameSpeedcode variablep  pThanksp

Negative 317 pIm fairly new to OSX development. Im currently writing an app which has its own crossplatform custom XMLbased file type.p  pI want to write a quick look plugin so that things look good in the finder, and have found the tutorial on how this is supposed to work, but apparently I must be doing something wrong since I see in varlogsystem.log that I get a segfault when my Quick Look plugin is ran. Id like to see where its crashing, but I cant for the life of me figure out how to do that.p  pWhere does OSX store core dumps if it even does that Do I need to set some system option or something to enable thatp  pHow do I get Xcode to look at these core dumpsp  pIm lost.p
Negative 317 pI am attempting to make a drawingpainting app using codeTextureViewcode on Android. I want to support a drawing surface of up to 4096x4096 pixels, which seems reasonable for my minimum target device which I use for testing which is a Google Nexus 7 2013 which has a nice quad core CPU and 2GB memory.p  pOne of my requirements is that my view must be inside of a view that allows it to be zoomed in and out and panned, which is all custom code I have written think UIScrollView from iOS.p  pIve tried using a regular View not codeTextureViewcode with OnDraw and performance was absolutely horrible  less than 1 frame a second. This happened even if I called codeInvalidaterectcode with only the rect that changed. I tried turning off hardware acceleration for the view, but nothing rendered, I assume because 4096x4096 is too big for software.p  pI then tried using codeTextureViewcode and performance is a little better  about 510 frames per second still terrible but better. The user draws into a bitmap, which is then later drawn into the texture using a background thread. Im using Xamarin but hopefully the code makes sense to Java people.p  precodeprivate void RunUpdateThread      try              TimeSpan sleep  TimeSpan.FromSeconds1.0f  60.0f         while true                      lock dirtyRect                              if dirtyRect.Width gt 0 ampamp dirtyRect.Height gt 0                                      Canvas c  LockCanvasdirtyRect                     if c  null                                              c.DrawBitmapbitmap, dirtyRect, dirtyRect, bufferPaint                         dirtyRect.Set0, 0, 0, 0                         UnlockCanvasAndPostc                                                                Thread.Sleepsleep                   catch            codepre  pIf I change lockCanvas to pass null instead of a rect, performance is great at 60 fps, but the contents of the codeTextureViewcode flicker and get corrupted, which is disappointing. I would have thought it would simply be using an OpenGL frame buffer  render texture underneath or at least have an option to preserve contents.p  pAre there any other options short of doing everything in raw OpenGL in Android for high performance drawing and painting on a surface that is preserved in between draw callsp
Negative 317 pIm using vs2012 and have a project where I have an Entity Framework v4.4 model pointed at a Sql Server 2008R2 database. For a while I have been adding stored procs and functions to the database and using Update Model From Database to bring them into the model without any problems.p  pRecently another developer working on the project started having trouble adding new stored procs and functions  he is using VS2013. When he chooses Update Model From Database, new stored procs show up in the list of procs to add, but when Finish is pressed, they are not added to the model, and in fact if he chooses Update Model From Database again, they are still listed in the new stored procs to add. Same thing happens with new functions.p  pHe was able to get around this by modifying the edmx file manually, but we dont like this solution.p  pWe have looked on SO and seen messages regarding giving EXECUTE permission on the procs which we have not had to do before this. We tried giving the Execute permission, but that didnt change anything  same behavior.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 317 pI am editing an HTML site that includes several paragraphs in Arabic, and something strange is happening when I delete or replace existing words.  If I place a cursor in the middle of a paragraph and press backspace to delete a word letterbyletter, sometimes the cursor moves left and deletes letters to the left of the cursor as should be expected with a righttoleft language, but after the first word is deleted, the cursor starts moving right and deletes the word on the right.  Other times it happens vice versaright first, then left.  I dont speak Arabic using Google translate to replace outdated text, but I am still puzzled by this behavior.  p  pAdditionally, if I select a single word and paste another word into the selection, the entire line moves, and its obvious than more than the word I selected has been replaced.  I can verify that something is wrong because when I copy the resulting text  into Google Translate, it stops making grammatical sense.p  pAre there special rules I need to follow when editing righttoleft text in HTML files  I am using Notepad btw.p

Negative 317 pRyan Dahl has said he invented NodeJS to solve the file upload progress bar problem a hrefhttpsyoutu.beSAc0vQCC6UQ relnofollowhttpsyoutu.beSAc0vQCC6UQa. Using technology available in 2009 when Node was introduced, so before Express and more advanced clientside javascript libraries that automagically tell you progress updates, how exactly did NodeJS solve this problemp  pTrying to use just Core NodeJS now, I understand with the request stream I can look at the header, get the total file size, and then get the size of each chunk of data as it comes through, to tell me the percent complete. But then I dont understand how to stream those progress updates back to the browser, since the browser doesnt seem to update until request.end.p  pOnce again I want to wrap my ahead around how NodeJS originally solved this progress update problem. WebSockets werent around yet, so you couldnt just open a WebSocket connection to the client and stream the progress updates back to the browser.

Negative 317 pI was making a program and I stumbled across this twoinone problem, where the first problem leads to the other. I have not yet found a question where someone had both problems leading into eachother. Im still learing, and have learned a lot from other problems I had, but I cant find a solution to this problem.p  pIt has to do with threading. I want to make a thread, that can place something in a rich textbox every second or so, while I can still press buttons to start and stop it. But to make a function that a thread can run, I need to make the function static. Otherwise Ill get the error A field initializer cannot reference the nonstatic field, method, or property. But when a function is static, it cannot acces any of the created items, like richTextBox1. Because if I try to change its text, I get the error Error    1   An object reference is required for the nonstatic field, method, or property. And if I fix this by removing static, the thread will not work.p  pI made a demo program that is smaller than the full one, but has the same problem.

Negative 317 pI am working on an application that has some scalability requirements and consists of a webbased frontend along with a set of services and workflows.  In the architecture that I have designed, some of these services will perform necessary transformations on a given set of data, pull additional data from a database, and so on.p  pIn terms of documenting my architectural design, I am wondering if someone can suggest a couple books or some reading material on what are the best practices.  I am not looking for a guide on UML.  Let me clarify...p  pFor example I have a service... lets call it my Workflow service.  It will take a request, read some stuff from a database to look up that request, and trigger a workflow.  Sounds easy enough.  In terms of the architectural design, lets say I break off the database logic into its own module or package... should this just be called the blahblahblahDAO or blahblahblahBusinessObjectsp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 317 pWhen i try to link dynamically against glew, the linker will throw errors like codeundefined reference impglewGenVertexArrayscode. The basic meaning is clear  the linker cant find any address to link the function calls against.p  pWhat bothers me is that i used the normal glew.h header and linked against glew32 not glew32s  ill come to that later on. Not defining codedefine GLEWSTATICcode, Glew should link dynamically out of the box. But the undefined error indicates that somehow it is trying to link statically against them. So i fixed it by linking against codeglew32scode and added codedefine GLEWSTATICcode before codeinclude GLglew.hcodep  pBut this is in my opinion just a workarround  i want to know why glew assumes static linking, when not asked to.

I cant seem to go from working with each letter in a string to each word, targeting the first letter.p  precodeclass String   def leetspeak     word  self.split     newword  []      word.each do i       if i  e         newword.push3       elsif i  o         newword.push0       elsif i  I         newword.push1       elsif i  s ampamp word.findindex   1  s         newword.pushz       else         newword.pushi       end     end     newword.join   end end codepre  pOn the last elsif, I thought I could target the first letter using .findindex   1, but it doesnt work, and even if it did, it doesnt work for the very first letter in the string, if it was s. Any help would be appreciated. p

Negative 317 pI have a Cartesian rectangular grid defined asp  precodex0, x1, ..., xni1 y0, y1, ..., ynj1 z0, z1, ..., znk1 codepre  pIn this 3D grid, a closed triangulated surface is immersed. My goal is to find the boundary cells that have intersections with the triangulated surface. I was thinking of using a signed distance function and by setting the following criteria, identify those which are intersected by the surfacep  precodeabsd lt sqrt dxdx  dydy  dzdz codepre  pwhere codedcode is the signed distance function, and codedxcode, codedycode, codedzcode are the grid spacing in codexcode, codeycode, codezcode direction. May I know the communitys thoughts on my approach Thank you.p

Negative 317 pI need to create a website using Spring MVC so Im using STS for this purpose.

Negative 317 pUse Casep  pIm building a site where users can search records  with SQL. BUT  they should also be able to save their search and be notified when a new submitted record meets the criteria.p  pIts not a car buying site, but for example The user searches for a 1967 Ford Mustang with a 289 V8 engine, within the 90291 ZIP code. Cant find the right one, but they want to be notified if a matching car is submitted 2 weeks later.p  pSo of course, every time a new car is added to the DB, I can retrieve all the user search queries, and run all of them over all the cars in the DB. But that is not scalable.p  pRather than search the entire car table with every search query every time a new car is submitted, I would like to just check that single car objectarray in memory, with the existing user queries. p  pIm doing this in PHP with Laravel and Eloquent, but I am implementation agnostic and welcome any theoretical approaches.p  pThanks,p  pChrisp
