Positive 6439 pFor some reason, visual studio 2015 is VERY buggy when it comes to coloring. I did not have any of these issues with 2013. For example, if I typep  precodeint array  new int[100] codepre  pThen the new i will be black while nt is in blue. I would expect all of it to be blue or whatever colors you choose. It fixes this if I disable colorization semantics but that makes the colorization not recognize macros, parameters, and a bunch of other stuff so that isnt a solution. Any ideasp

Positive 6439 pAm creating an app, which changes its color, when the seek bar is raised.

Negative 6439 pThis is a difficult and openended question I know, but I thought Id throw it to the floor and see if anyone had any interesting suggestions.p  pI have developed a codegenerator that takes our python interface to our C code generated via SWIG and generates code needed to expose this as WebServices.  When I developed this code I did it using TDD, but Ive found my tests to be brittle as hell.  Because each test essentially wanted to verify that for a given bit of input code which happens to be a C header Id get a given bit of outputted code I wrote a small engine that reads test definitions from XML input files and generates test cases from these expectations.p  pThe problem is I dread going in to modify the code at all.  That and the fact that the unit tests themselves are a complex, and b brittle.p  pSo Im trying to think of alternative approaches to this problem, and it strikes me Im perhaps tackling it the wrong way.  Maybe I need to focus more on the outcome, IE does the code I generate actually run and do what I want it to, rather than, does the code look the way I want it to.p  pHas anyone got any experiences of something similar to this they would care to sharep

Negative 6439 pMy dev team is getting ready to start a new project. The shop has been a VB shop since the days of VB3, but the prevailing opinion now is that were a .NET shop and since C was created specifically for .NET, whereas VB.NET was a retrofit, weve decided to move forward writing C only. The controversy revolves around the question of whether the Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace has a legitimate place in new development or if it is only for backward compatibility for VB6 and older code. A further, and more interesting question is whether the code under the Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace is even .NET code of if it is really the old VB runtime carefully packaged in a .NET wrapper, making it in fact a COM interop control similar to how WinForms wraps the non.NET Win32 windowing API but exposes only .NET APIs for consumption.p  pTo make this even more confusing, our dev team has a Microsoft Consulting Services consultant telling us Microsoft no longer supports Visual Basic, strongincluding the VB runtime underlying the Microsoft.VisualBasic namespacestrong.p  pWhat Im looking for are links  preferably to unimpeachable Microsoft sources  to documentation that definitively answers this question one way or the other. Ive already tried several search permutations on Google and not gotten any closer to getting to the bottom of this question.p  pEDIT Apparently I didnt make my question clear. Im not asking if emVB.NETem is true .NET code.

Property Sheets vsprops do not seem to be able available for C projects and the SolutionDir variable is ignored. Are there any other methods to set properties across several C projectsp  pstrongUpdatestrong By Following the information in the answer by Bas Bossink I was able to set the output path of several projects by creating a common csproj and importing it into the individual project. A few other points p  ul liWhen building in Visual Studio if changes are made to the common project it is necessary to touchreload any projects that reference it for the changes to be picked up.li liAny properties which are also set in a individual project will override the common properties.li liSetting SolutionDir as the output path via the Visual Studio UI does not work as expected because the value is treated as a string literal rather than getting expanded. However, Setting SolutionDir directly into the csproj file with a text editor works as expected.li ul

Also involve hashing the password and msg data.li liSymmetric Encryption of the msg with static password stored on both sides, probably AES.li ol  pThere is no need for encryption as the msg would be publish online anyway.

It is a big factor for me. And the availability of the libraries available on both language are taken into account as well.p  pOr I can choose to rewrite the server side into java. Why not python The client side application need to be in javap  pWhat do you thinkp  phr p  pEDIT I would not treat this as a web application. The application does not serve any webpage. Most of the operations are not related to the web. Just the clientserver communication go through internet. And sending POSTGET via HTTP is what I thought of as the simpler albeit insecure way to do it. Feel free to suggest me any other alternative. p  pSSL is a secure way for encryption. But it does not prevent attacker from sending message to the server impose as the user. Anyone can initiate a HTTPS connection. And the content of the communication does not need to be encrypted. It will be published online by the server anyway. What I need is a way to authenticate the message and sender.p  pFor now I am lean to HMAC algorithm. RSA would be more secure but it comes with more developer efforts as well. Will see how it goes.p  pThank you.p
Negative 6439 pI am working in C and VS2008.p  pI have a WPF application containing a FlowDocument, which contains a paragraph, which contains a number of fairly short lines i.e. Spans and LineBreaks.

Negative 6439 pI currently use the nonstandard filter method of rendering opacity on my site in addition to the standard way, since IE still doesnt seem to support it and unless Im mistaken, opacity is part of CSS3 which isnt final anyway.p  pI guess this is more of annoyance, but Firefox correctly notes an error in parsing the value for filter, as it should since its not in the standard. This is great, except that I use this in about 10 places in my CSS sheet, so with every refresh when Im debugging my JavaScript I have to swim through a sea of useless filter warnings before I see anything relevant to what Im doing.p  pIs there a way to have Firefox specifically ignore a bit of CSS code and not throw out errors about it, if I know that its nonstandard and browser specific That would be the cleanest solution. I cant use the traditional server side method of just not outputting the code in the CSS file to begin with because Im doing most of this testing offline. p  pThanksp

Some but not all of the projects should be assignable to clients. p  pThis results in the following database schemap  precodeCompanies ID CompanyName  Clients  ID  CompanyID not nullable FirstName LastName   Projects ID CompanyID not nullable ClientID nullable ProjectName codepre  pThis leads to the following relationshipsp  precodeCompaniesClients 1n CompaniesProjects 1n ClientsProjects1n codepre  pNow, if a user is malicious, he might for example insert a Project with his own CompanyID, but with a ClientID belonging to another user, leaving the database in an inconsistent state. p  pThe problem occurs in a similar fashion all over my database schema, so Id like to solve this in a generic way if any possible. I had the following two ideasp  ul lipCheck for database writes that might lead to inconsistencies in the DAL. This would be generic, but requires some additional database queries before an update and create queries are performed, so it will result in less performance. pli lipCreate an additional table for the clientsProjects relationship and make sure the relationships created this way are consistent. This also requires some additional select queries, but far less than in the first case. On the other hand it is not generic, so it is easier to miss something in the long run, especially when adding more tables  dependencies to the database.pli ul  pWhat would you do Is there any better solution I missedp  pstrongEditstrong You might wonder why the Projects table has a CompanyID. This is because I want users to be able to add projects with and without clients. I need to keep track of which company and therefore which website user a clientless project belongs to, which is why a project needs a CompanyID. p

Negative 6439 pIm writing a program which reads text from a file, and determines the number of sentences, words, and syllables of that file. The trick is, it must only read one character a time, and work with that. Which means it cant just store the whole file in an array.p  pSo, with that in mind, heres how my program worksp  precodewhilecharacter  EOF      check if the character is a endofsentence marker .     check if the character is whitespace   t n     must be a letter now     check if the letter is a vowel  codepre  pUsing a statemachine approach, each time the loop goes through, certain triggers are either 1 or 0, and this effects the count. I have had no trouble counting the sentences or the words, but the syllables are giving my trouble. The definition for syllable that I am using is any vowel or group of vowels counts as 1 syllable, however a single e at the end of a word does not count as a syllable.p  pWith that in mind, Ive created code such that p  precodeif character  A  E ...  o  u     if the last character wasnt a vowel then     set the flag for the letter being a vowel.     so that next time through, it doesnt get counted     and add one to the syllable count.     if the last character was a vowel, then dont change the flag and dont     add to the count.  codepre  pNow the problem i have, is my count for a given text file, is very low. The given count is 57 syllables, 36 words, and 3 sentences. I get the sentences correct, same with the words, but my syllable count is only 35.p  pI also have it setup so that when the program reads a . or whitespace it will look at the last character read, and if that is an e, it will take one off the syllable count. This takes care of the e being at the end of a word not counting as a vowel.p  pSo with this in mind, I know there must be something wrong with my methodology to get such a vast difference. I must be forgetting something.p  pDoes anyone have some suggestions I didnt want to include my entire program, but I can include certain blocks if necessary.p  pEDIT Some code...p  pI have if  endofsentence marker, then else if whitespace, then the final else which entails that only letters which can form words will be in this block. This is the only block of code which should have any effect on the counting of syllables...p  precodeifchrctr  A  chrctr  E  chrctr  I  chrctr  O  chrctr  U  chrctr  a  chrctr  e  chrctr  i  chrctr  o   chrctr  u                      ifchrctr  E  chrctr  e                              isE  1                          else                              isE  0                          ifskipSylb  1                              endSylb  1                 skipSylb  1                          else                              endSylb  0                 skipSylb  1                               else                      endSylb  0             skipSylb  0           codepre  pSo to explain... endSylb if 1, later in the program will add one to the count of syllables. skipSylb is used to flag if the last character was also a syllable. If skipSylb  1, then this is a block of vowels and we only want to add one to the counter. Now I have an isE variable, which just tells the program next time around that the last letter was an E. This means, next time through the while loop, if it is an end of sentence, or whitespace, and the last letter was E so isE  1, then we have added one too many syllables.p  pHopefully that helps. p  pSince the value is actually lower then what it should be, i thought perhaps the statements where i minus from the count are important too.  I use this if statement to decide when to minus from the countp  precode ifisE  1                    countSylb           codepre  pThis statement happens when the character is whitespace, or an end of sentence character. I cant think of anything else relevant, but i still feel like im not including enough. Oh well, let me know if something is unclear.p

Negative 6439 pWithin my controller specs I am stubbing out valid for some routing tests, based on Ryan Bates niftyscaffold as follows p  precodeit create action should render new template when model is invalid do   Company.anyinstance.stubsvalid.returnsfalse   post create   response.should rendertemplatenew end codepre  pThis is fine when I test the controllers in isolation. I also have the following in my model specp  precodeit is valid with valid attributes do   company.should bevalid end codepre  pAgain this works fine when tested in isolation. The problem comes if I run spec for both models and controllers. The model test always fails as the valid method has been stubbed out. Is there a way for me to remove the stubbing of anyinstance when the controller test is torn down.p  pI have got around the problem by running the tests in reverse alphabetic sequence to ensure the model tests run before the controllers but I really dont like my tests being sequence dependant.p
Negative 6439 pIm currently working in Swing UI Assignment. This work involves showing large file content in JTextArea. The file size can be as large as 2 GB.p  pMy initial idea is to lazily load content from the file, say 1 MB of content will be shown to the user. As the user scrolls i will retrieve the next 1 MB of content to be shown. All these operation will be happening in background thread Swing Worker.p  pI looked at the JTextArea API, the method insert takes String and intposition of the insert as the parameter.p  pThis will suffice, but im worried about performance, because the content 1 MB at a time retrieved will have to be converted to String object.  p  pIs there any other work around or any other alternativebetter solution for this.p

Negative 6439 pI have a typical client server communication  Client sends data to the server, server processes that, and returns data to the client. The problem is that the process operation can take quite some time  order of magnitude  minutes. There are a few approaches that could be used to solve this.p  ol liEstablish a connection, and keep it alive, until the operation is finished and the client receives the response.li liEstablish connection, send data, close the connection. Now the processing takes place and once it is finished the server could establish a connection to the client to send the data. li liEstablish a connection, send data, close the connection. Processing takes place. client asks server, every n minutesseconds if the operation is finished. If the processing is finished the client fetches the data.li ol  pI was wondering which approach would be the best way to use. Is there maybe some de facto standard for solving this problem How expensive is opening a socket in Java Solution 1. seems pretty nasty to me, but 2. and 3. could do. The problem with solution 2. is that the server needs to know on which port the client is listening, while solution 3. adds some network overhead.p

                in which order they appear. If looks better when the longer word is above the other though. Plus, the way it breaks makes it unreadable when the longer word is on the bottom if the remainder of the text needs to span many lines.             ltpgt             ltpgt                 Another problem is when the bottom word                 ltphp createWordStacknomatter3,is,isnt gt                 longer than the top word but actually consists of a single word. It cannot wrap and therefore interferes with the following text.             ltpgt              ltpgt                 ltphp createWordStacknomatter4,It really becomes unusable and quite ugly if the top word happens to wrap and span over two or more lines. Of course, the first know issue shown above is enough to understand that THIS known issue doesnt mean a thing if it is the bottom that is too long as it will span over many lines no matter what since it is limited by the width of the shorter word above..,It still works gt                 .. and so, all in all, it is better to avoid long words altogether.             ltpgt             ltpgt                 Now, just to illustrate what I am saying above..                  ltphp createWordStacknomatter5,Look at this shit,It really becomes unusable and quite ugly if the top word happens to wrap and span over two or more lines. Of course, the first know issue shown above is enough to understand that THIS known issue doesnt mean a thing if it is the bottom that is too long as it will span over many lines no matter what since it is limited by the width of the shorter word above.. gt                 .. and so, all in all, it is better to avoid long words altogether.             ltpgt             lth2gtNoteslth2gt             ltpgt                 At least, the next paragraph                 ltphp createWordStacknomatter6,isnt,is gt                 pushed down too far.             ltpgt             ltpgt                 ltphp createWordStacknomatter7,It works,It doesnt work gt                 when I put the stackBottom BEFORE the stackTop, so I could also call them stackChosen and stackAlternate and just change the className in order to choose one or the other. This is what the javascript used to do when you click on the stack if the label is of class stackTop, it changes it to stackBottom, and viceversa. Now, only the colour is changed..             ltpgt         ltformgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pSo the question is How would I go about resolving the known issues explained in the test page Im sorry, I know this is no way of asking a question, but I just dont know how else to phrase it.

Negative 6439 pSo in my JAXRS application, I have 2 ExceptionMapper registered as Providerp  precodepublic class MyExceptionMapper implements ExceptionMapperltExceptiongt ...  public class MyCustomRuntimeExceptionMapper implements ExceptionMapperltMyCustomRuntimeExceptiongt ... codepre  pWhen my application throws a new MyCustomRuntimeException, the exception is caught inside the MyExceptionMapper, even though JAXRS spec says it should be caught inside MyCustomRuntimeExceptionMapper.p  pHeres what JAXRS says  p  pJAXRS supports exception inheritance as well. When an exception is thrown, JAXRS will first try and find an ExceptionMapper for that exceptions type. If it cannot find one, it will look for a mapper that can handle the exceptions superclass. It will continue this process until there are no more superclasses to match against.p  pAnyone have a clue, whats going on here Thanks.p

Negative 6439 pEvery time I write trivial getters get functions that just return the value of the member I wonder why dont oop languages simply have a read only access modifier that would allow reading the value of the members of the object but does not allow you to set them just like const things in c.p  pThe private,protected,public access modifiers gives you either full readwrite access or no access.p  pWriting a getter and calling it every time is slow, because function calling is slower than just accessing a member. A good optimizer can optimize these getter calls out but this is magic. And I dont think it is good idea learning how an optimizer of a certain compiler works and write code to exploit it.p  pSo why do we need to write accessors, read only interfaces everywhere in practice when just a new access modifier would do the trickp  pps1 please dont tell things like It would break the encapsulation. A public codefoo.getXcode and a public but read only codefoo.xcode would do the same thing. p  pEDIT I didnt composed my post clear. Sorry. I mean you can read the members value outside but you cant set it. You can only set its value inside the class scope.p

Negative 6439 pIve got a large folder on an offsite backup machine that gets populated with files by rsync through deltacopy every night running windows xp from the main work site. Ive discovered some annoying folders that cannot be opened, or deleted, or even checked for file sizes. I get the such and such a folder is not accessible, access is denied message when I try to click on it in windows explorer. According to the windows explorer tooltip they are also empty and the properties of these folders say 0 bytes and 0 files.p  pI currently have a C program that goes through every folder and file and tries to copy the whole backup directory to a dated backupbackup directory, which is how i discovered this problem in the first place. The regular System.IO library seems helpless against these blasted folders. Exceptions are thrown when I even try to access the folder path.p  pDoes anyone have any clue how I could, say, on an access denied exception in my existing copy code, force the delete of these folders so rysnc can recreate the directory again and get the whole thing synced againp

Negative 6439 pTo put some context, my game has been developped for android 1.5. So it was using the lowest resolution by default on any android phones. Which was great, game was running fast and all.p  pNow I added support for scoreloop which required my game to support android 1.6. When I runned the game I realized everything got smaller since I used unit dimension without looking at the screen density. p  pNow that I fixed sizing. I realize that my game seems a bit choppy. I believe that redrawing on the new screen resolution is the problem.p  pI draw my game in a Canvas in a SurfaceView. How can I make it faster I use default functions like drawCircle, drawLine...

Negative 6439 pI am working on some user registration code, and Im wondering where the best place is to put my validation code.  I can create a user validation object and pass the user model to it to validate, or I can just instantiate the validation object within the user model or even write the validation code into the user model, however, Im thinking that this would be wasteful as the validation objectcode is only used when registering, and editing user data.  Therefore, Im leaning to keeping the user validation object external.  Can someone advise me as to what the best practices are  Appreciate your helpp

The background is well lit and does not move.

Then dilate 4x to make the lighter areas in labels shrink. Then I do a binary threshold to get a big blog, followed by finding contours in this image. I then take the largest contour and draw it, which becomes my shape to either save to the accepted set or compare with the accepted set.p  pCurrently Im using cvMatchShapes, but the double return value seems to vary widely. Im guessing it is because it doesnt take into account rotation.p  pIs this approach a good one  It isnt working well for glass bottles since the edges are hard to find...p  pIve read about haar classifiers, but thinking that might be overkill for my task.p

Negative 6439 pWhat is the appropriate way for handling exceptions from libraries imported by other libraries in Pythonp  pFor example, I have a library called pycontrol that I import into my main program. pycontrol imports the suds library. The suds library, in turn, imports the urllib2 library. Ive noticed that when the suds library has trouble connecting to remote resources it is accessing through urllib2, these exceptions trickle up to my main program. p  pMy best guess at this point is to import urllib2 and suds into my global name space and catch typical exceptions that get thrown by them and arent handled in pycontrol. p  pIs there some other best practice as to how one might approach thisp  pA basic idea of what the snippet of code looks like without importing suds or urllib2 into global name spacep  precode    import pycontrol.pycontrol as pc      print Connecting to iControl API on LTM s...  ltm     try         b  pc.BIGIPhostnameltm, usernameuser, passwordpw,              wsdlswsdllist, fromurlTrue,             debugsoapdebug     except ltwhattocatchgt, detail         print Error could not connect to iControl API on LTM s... aborting  ltm         print Details s  detail         exitcode  1     else         print Connection successfully established. codepre  pHeres a sample tracebackp  precodeConnecting to iControl API on LTM s0bigip1lb2.lab.zynga.com...

Negative 6439 pCurrently Im experimenting with a little Haskell webserver written in Snap that loads and makes available to the client a lot of data. And I have a very, very hard time gaining control over the server process. At random moments the process uses a lot of CPU for seconds to minutes and becomes irresponsive to client requests. Sometimes memory usage spikes and sometimes drops hundreds of megabytes within seconds.p  pHopefully someone has more experience with long running Haskell processes that use lots of memory and can give me some pointers to make the thing more stable. Ive been debugging the thing for days now and Im starting to get a bit desperate here.p  pA little overview of my setupp  ul lipOn server startup I read about 5 gigabytes of data into a big nested Data.Mapalike structure in memory. The nested map is value strict and all values inside the map are of datatypes with all their field made strict as well. Ive put a lot of time in ensuring no unevaluated thunks are left. The import depending on my system load takes around 530 minutes. The strange thing is the fluctuation in consecutive runs is way bigger than I would expect, but thats a different problem.pli lipThe big data structure lives inside a TVar that is shared by all client threads spawned by the Snap server. Clients can request arbitrary parts of the data using a small query language. The amount of data request usually is small upto 300kb or so and only touches a small part of the data structure. All readonly request are done using a readTVarIO, so they dont require any STM transactions.pli lipThe server is started with the following flags RTS N I0 qg qb. This starts the server in multithreaded mode, disable idletime and parallel GC. This seems to speed up the process a lot.pli ul  pThe server mostly runs without any problem. However, every now and then a client request times out and the CPU spikes to 100 or even over 100 and keeps doing this for a long while. Meanwhile the server does not respond to request anymore.p  pThere are few reasons I can think of that might cause the CPU usagep  ul lipThe request just takes a lot of time because there is a lot of work to be done. This is somewhat unlikely because sometimes it happens for requests that have proven to be very fast in previous runs with fast I mean 2080ms or so.pli lipThere are still some unevaluated thunks that need to be computed before the data can be processed and sent to the client. This is also unlikely, with the same reason as the previous point.pli lipSomehow garbage collection kicks in and start scanning my entire 5GB heap. I can imagine this can take up a lot of time.pli ul  pThe problem is that I have no clue how to figure out what is going on exactly and what to do about this. Because the import process takes such a long time profiling results dont show me anything useful. There seems to be no way to conditionally turn on and off the profiler from within code.p  pI personally suspect the GC is the problem here. Im using GHC7 which seems to have a lot of options to tweak how GC works. p  pWhat GC settings do you recommend when using large heaps with generally very stable datap

Negative 6439 pi have a problem with Resource dictionaries and mergeddictionaries in general, especially when it comes to resourcelookup performance. After some performance testing i found that ResourceDictionary.getMergedDictionaries is the call with the most hits checked in ANTS profiler. We have around 300 resource dictionary xamls, and a lot of them are using merged dictionary to include other styles. Well the getMergedDictionaries count on one part of our application, where not much is happening, was around 10 million hits. So my guess is we are doing something completely wrong with Resource dictionaries in general. So i tried to refactor everything and i want to try to get rid of all the merged dictionaries.p  pNow to the actual question. I tried to get rid of the mergeddictionaries but i failed. My understanding is that when you use StaticResource the lookup needs the resource to be defined before the current one. I made the following short examplep  pOne main project and one custom control library.p  pthe custom control library contains 2 xamls.p  precodelt Colors.xaml gt ltResourceDictionary [stripped namespaces] gt     ltSolidColorBrush xKeymyColor ColorGreengt ltResourceDictionarygt  lt Templates.xaml gt ltResourceDictionary [stripped namespaces]gt     ltControlTemplate xKeymyTemplate TargetTypeButtongt         ltRectangle FillStaticResource myColorgt     ltControlTemplategt ltResourceDictionarygt codepre  pNow in the main project, the MainWindow.xaml looks like thisp  precodeltWindow xClassResourceTest.Window1     xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation     xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml     TitleWindow1 Height300 Width300gt     ltWindow.Resourcesgt         ltResourceDictionarygt             ltResourceDictionary.MergedDictionariesgt                 ltResourceDictionary SourceResourceTestLibcomponentThemesColors.xamlgt                 ltResourceDictionary SourceResourceTestLibcomponentThemesTemplate.xamlgt             ltResourceDictionary.MergedDictionariesgt         ltResourceDictionarygt     ltWindow.Resourcesgt     ltGridgt         ltButton TemplateStaticResource myTemplategt     ltGridgt ltWindowgt codepre  pThat is the desired goal. but unfortunately this crashes because the resource myColor cannot be found. I of course know how to fix it, add a mergeddictionary in Templates.xaml and reference Colors.xaml but i always thought, well i never really checked, that resources are looked up depending on the logical tree and the resources of the element. My understanding is Button is created try to lookup template .. found try to lookup color, not found on own resources, walk up and use the windows resources.p  pIt seems that im wrong.  So i hope someone can shed some light on this for me. We make heavy use of WPF and despite of this we accomplished a lot with it, but because of some wrong learned behaviour in the beginning, our performance is pretty bad just because of the resource lookup. Any help would be greatly appreciatedp  pThanks in advance Best regards Nicop

So in this light of usage of this table, do we really need to bother with creation of a clustered index over codeMyTableIdcode or two nonclustered indices over codeSomeTable2Idcode and codeSomeTable3Idcode are sufficientp

Negative 6439 pI have a following scenariop  pA method that gets the list of people from a certain class that are shorter than some height threshold. I am using Where extension method to filter them out. Since the predicate depends on some external data, codeclassIdcode and codeheightcode variables become a part of the lambda closure.p  precodepublic ListltPersongt getPeopleFromClassShorterThanLimitint classId, int height      Database db  new Database     return db.Persons.Wherep gt p.Height lt height ampamp p.ClassId  classId.ToList  codepre  pThe problem is that sometimes the predicate gets complicated so I want to extract it to another methodp  precodepublic ListltPersongt getPeopleFromClassLowerThanLimitint classId, int height      Database db  new Database     return db.Persons.WhereisLowerThan.ToList   private bool isLowerThanPerson person    codepre  pHowever, the closure here becomes the problem, because I cant pass the variables to the predicate function. I can make a delegate function inline not using lambdas so that the predicate looks like a function, but then this function must also be in the same method as the codeWherecode call. In most of the scenarios its ok, strongbut sometimes I want an external function unknown at compile time to be called as the codeWherecode predicatestrong.p  pThe closest I came to the solution is thisp  precodepublic delegate bool ExtendedPredicateltT, TArggtT argument, TArg[] arguments  public static class Extended      public static IEnumerableltTgt WhereltT, TArggtthis IEnumerableltTgt collection, ExtendedPredicateltT, TArggt predicate, params TArg[] arguments              foreach T item in collection                      if predicateitem, arguments                 yield return item                   yield break        public ListltPersongt getPeopleFromClassShorterThanLimitint classId, int height      Database db  new Database     return db.Persons.WhereisFromClassShorterThanLimit, classId, height.ToList   public bool isFromClassShorterThanLimitPerson person, int[] arguments      return person.Height lt arguments[0] ampamp person.ClassId  arguments[1]  codepre  pbut I find it somewhat too narrow and also, for each extension method a new overload would have to be written. In addition to all that, I guess the EntityFramework would not be able to convert such expressions into a reasonable SQL statement not sure about this, I am no expert in how EF generates SQL from lambdas, but thats a wild guess.  emvariable number of arguments may or may not be providedemp  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pWhat Id like know to is whether there is any smart way of achieving this with regular delegates not forcing compiletime defined functions to be used as a predicate without such hacks as one shown abovep

Negative 6439 pI recently implemented the levenshtein algorithm into our search engine database, but we have come across a problem. p  pAccording to the basic levenshteinp  pLevenshtein123456,12x456 is the same value as Levenshtein123456, 12345xp  pNormally this is fine, but for my specific problem that is incorrect. When someone uses our website, this is incorrect. Manufacturers of electronic components often make similar products with only a difference in the very last letter. If the first letter is different, its usually an entirely different category. Therefore I need an algorithm that considers matches near the beginning of the word more valuable than those in the back or in other words, mismatches that occur near the beginning should apply a larger penalty than those in the back. p  pIf anyone has any idea please let me know. p

Negative 6439 pI am implementing my own fsm to parse a file. I am new to fsm pattern so trying to learn about it. p  pMy fsm class takes a stream of the file that is being parsed along with the current state and a collection of all accepting states. p  pNow I am confused about couple of things. p  ol lipHow does the fsm move through states and keep track of what has been parsed so farpli lipWhat information should the state object store Right now they have a pattern that they match on the line and see if fsm can move to this state or not. pli ol  pExamplep  pFile to parsep  precodePerson  bob smith         Age 33         Location new York End person Person  Jane smith         Age 66         Location Chicago End person codepre  pSo I have a state for person start, age, location and end person.

Negative 6439 pFirst of all, I read a lot of these license questions and still it confuses me, I think there cannot be enough clarification...p  pI want to create a commercial closedsource application on Windows using Qt and some other unchanged LGPL libraries. The libraries used with dynamic linking and are distributed as DLL files with the application.p  pAs far as I understand the LGPL the application is a work that uses the Library and therefore falls outside the scope of the LGPL license. However, section 5 of the LGPL also statesp  blockquote   pHowever, linking a work that uses the Library with the Library   creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library because it   contains portions of the Library, rather than a work that uses the   library. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section   6 states terms for distribution of such executables.p blockquote  pQuestion 1 Well, the application emisem linking at some time, but dynamically. Is it correct that linking in section 5 refers to static linking only and not to dynamic linkingp  pAnd two other questions Im still not sure about when distributing dynamically linked LGPL libsp  pQuestion 2 In the Copyright section About Dialog, do I need to mention the used libraries and provide the LGPL license text or notp  pQuestion 3 Do I need to distribute the source code of the used libraries or provide the customer a way to receive the source code from me or not If yes, is a http link to the Website for example Qt enough for this purpose or notp  pThanks a lot for the clarifications.p  pChrisp

Negative 6439 pDone a search and I really didnt see a matched answer with this tricky problem.p  pHere I come, guys. Thanks for your help in advance.p  pI am trying to call a JPanel within a JPanels button by using actionlistener while it worked fine with the first button I added, it doesnt work for the other two

thought I only need to call the these two jpanels in different buttons without creating a totally new JPanel to contain each jpanel to draw a chart, and then call them like I call the another jpanel

Everything works beautifully.p  pI have a few projects that are dependencies for other projects, and I would like to tweak the Ivy config so that these dependencies can publish locally, and so that the downstream projects that depend on them can resolve them locally.

Negative 6439 pI have a high volume netty server that keeps consuming memory.  Using jmap, Ive tracked it down to the fact that pipelines just seem to keep growing and growing along with nio sockets, etc.  It is like the socket isnt ever disconnecting.   p  pMy initialization of the ServerBootstrap isp  precode    ServerBootstrap bootstrap  new ServerBootstrapnew NioServerSocketChannelFactorycoreThreads, workThreads, Runtime.getRuntime.availableProcessors2     bootstrap.setOptionchild.keepAlive, false     bootstrap.setOptionchild.tcpNoDelay, true     bootstrap.setPipelineFactorynew HttpChannelPipelineFactorythis, HttpServer.IdleTimer     bootstrap.bindnew InetSocketAddresshost, port codepre  pcoreThreads and workThreads are java.util.concurrent.Executors.newCachedThreadPool.  p  pIdleTimer is    private static Timer IdleTimer  new HashedWheelTimerp  pMy pipeline factory isp  precode    ChannelPipeline pipeline  Channels.pipeline     pipeline.addLastidletimer, new HttpIdleHandlertimer     pipeline.addLastdecoder, new HttpRequestDecoder     pipeline.addLastaggregator, new HttpChunkAggregator65536     pipeline.addLastencoder, new HttpResponseEncoder     pipeline.addLastchunkwriter, new ChunkedWriteHandler     pipeline.addLasthttp.handler , handler     pipeline.addLasthttp.closer, new HttpClose codepre  pHttpIdleHandler is the basic stock idle handler given in the examples except using the all.  It doesnt get executed that often.  The timeout is 500 milliseconds. aka 12 second.  The idle handler calls close on the channel.  The HttpClose is a simple close the channel on everything that makes it there just in case the handler doesnt process it. It executes very irregularly.p  pOnce Ive sent the response in my handler derived from SimpleChannelUpstreamHandler, I close  the channel regardless of keepalive setting.  Ive verified that Im closing channels by adding a listener to the channels ChannelFuture returned by close and the value of isSuccess in the listener is true.  p  pSome examples from the jmap output columns are rank, number of instances, size in bytes, classnamep  precode 3        147168        7064064  java.util.HashMapEntry  4         90609        6523848  org.jboss.netty.channel.DefaultChannelPipelineDefaultChannelHandlerContext  6         19788        3554584  [Ljava.util.HashMapEntry  8         49893        3193152  org.jboss.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpHeadersEntry 11         11326        2355808  org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioAcceptedSocketChannel 24         11326         996688  org.jboss.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpRequestDecoder 26         22668         906720  org.jboss.netty.util.internal.LinkedTransferQueue 28          5165         826400  [Lorg.jboss.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpHeadersEntry 30         11327         815544  org.jboss.netty.channel.AbstractChannelChannelCloseFuture 31         11326         815472  org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.DefaultNioSocketChannelConfig 33         12107         774848  java.util.HashMap 34         11351         726464  org.jboss.netty.util.HashedWheelTimerHashedWheelTimeout 36         11327         634312  org.jboss.netty.channel.DefaultChannelPipeline 38         11326         634256  org.jboss.netty.handler.timeout.IdleStateHandlerState 45         10417         500016  org.jboss.netty.util.internal.LinkedTransferQueueNode 46          9661         463728  org.jboss.netty.util.internal.ConcurrentIdentityHashMapHashEntry 47         11326         453040  org.jboss.netty.handler.stream.ChunkedWriteHandler 48         11326         453040  org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioSocketChannelWriteRequestQueue 51         11326         362432  org.jboss.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpChunkAggregator 52         11326         362432  org.jboss.netty.util.internal.ThreadLocalBoolean 53         11293         361376  org.jboss.netty.handler.timeout.IdleStateHandlerAllIdleTimeoutTask 57          4150         323600  [Lorg.jboss.netty.util.internal.ConcurrentIdentityHashMapHashEntry 58          4976         318464  org.jboss.netty.handler.codec.http.DefaultHttpRequest 64         11327         271848  org.jboss.netty.channel.SucceededChannelFuture 65         11326         271824  org.jboss.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpResponseEncoder 67         11326         271824  org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioSocketChannelWriteTask 73          5370         214800  org.jboss.netty.channel.UpstreamMessageEvent 74          5000         200000  org.jboss.netty.channel.AdaptiveReceiveBufferSizePredictor 81          5165         165280  org.jboss.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpHeaders 84          1562         149952  org.jboss.netty.handler.codec.http.DefaultCookie 96          2048          98304  org.jboss.netty.util.internal.ConcurrentIdentityHashMapSegment 98          2293          91720  org.jboss.netty.buffer.BigEndianHeapChannelBuffer codepre  pWhat am I missing  What thread is responsible for releasing its reference to the pipeline or socket channel such that the garbage collector will collect this memory  There appears to be some large hashtable holding on to them several references to hashtable entries that I filtered out of the above list.p

Negative 6439 pAs far as I understand, using works like a trycatchfinally, so I would expect that if an exception occurs in a using statement it would get caught which is kinda odd, because that would also mean that the exception is silently eaten.

Ive devised a simple test to demonstrate the issue.p  pHere is where I force an exception to occur inside the using statementp  precodeusing TcpClient client  new TcpClient       Why does this throw when the using statement is supposed to be a trycatchfinally     client.Connectnull  codepre  pAn exception is throw by codeclient.Connectcode meaning that it was not caught by the using statement or that it was rethrown p  precodeSystem.ArgumentNullException Value cannot be null.

Negative 6439 pIm new to webservice development.  Im using Netbeans 7.0 with the Axis2 plugin and Tomcat 7.p  pI created one project for the server components where I define the web methods, and then created another project for the client components.  The client was created in Netbeans by selecting New  Webservice Client.p  pWhen you select New  Webservice Client in Netbeans, it asks you right then for a WSDL URL.  So of course I gave it the WSDL URL from my local Tomcat installation.  But what about when I distribute this as a real application  The users arent going to point their clients at a hrefhttplocalhost8080axis2services relnofollowhttplocalhost8080axis2servicesawsdl.  I mean, when running the client from the IDE, it all works fine, but when I distribute this its a labor management application by the way where you clock in  out at one or more clients and time cards are written to a central DB, each client needs to be able to point at the webservice URL of whatever production server its supposed to connect to.p  pId like to store the webservice URL in a properties file, but dont really know what all to do programmatically at the client to make the call to the URL thats loaded from the properties file.  p  pIn my clients dist folder, if I open the JAR that netbeans created with WinZip, I see a file name jaxwscatalog.xml that has the URL in it which is pointed at localhost.  I assume this is where the URL thats used at runtime comes from.p  pSo whats the correct way to go about this  Ive searched around, but the things Ive found looking on google searches tend to show webservice calls being made in a completely different way than the autogenerated code that Netbeans puts together, and Id like some info specific to how Netbeans creates a webservice client so that I dont end up making changes just to have the IDE overwrite them.p  pThanks  Sorry for the long explanation.p  pJimp

Negative 6439 pLast night I updated from a trunk and merged 3 files and there was some errors not compile time while merging that I couldnt figure out. Before I figure out the problem I committed my changes which contained the merged files with others. p  pThe automatic testing server sends me a build error that it couldnt find one of the class. I deleted that class locally and created with a new one with different name and replaced its usages. Then I updated from the trunk again and committed my changes but still the build error from the testing server is referring to the old class I deleted which no longer exists in my local machine and of course I committed those changes. p  pHow should I fix this problemp

Negative 6439 pAs a school project i have taken up making an angry birds clone in matlab. After working on it a little bit, i have realized that perhaps i bit more then i could chew.p  pCurrently i am working on the physics of it, and while i understand the mechanics behind the game collisions, inertia and whatnot i dont know how i will implement it in the game. I am new to programming but i like it and have caught on to it fairly quickly.p  pIn angry birds we are dealing with collisions between several OBBs and i have an algorithm for detecting collisions. I have a function that checks all the corners of every box and looks to see if it is within another box. I realize this is not the best way to do it but since i couldnt visualize the separating axis theorem, i chose not to use it.p  pWhen the collision happens, the box is penetrating into another box, when this happens i do a liner interpolation between its previous point and the current point. I do this to all colliding points in one instance this is my method to resolve multiple collisions. Using the interpolation i detect the first collision that takes place and i implement a collision response. p  pMy issue currently is that when there is one box sitting on top of another, this method doesnt work so well, because at every instance the top box penetrates into the bottom one very slightly, and i bounce it back. This causes my entire thing to stop, because i go back in time, solve the collision, and then in the next instance the collision is happening again.p  pMy question is, how do i solve this problem of multiple boxes sitting on top of one another. p  pI have looked at all of the articles on physics by a hrefhttpwww.wildbunny.co.uk relnofollowhttpwww.wildbunny.co.uka and tried to understand his method but while i understand what he does, i have no clue how he does it. I also do not know any action script so much of his code is gibberish to me.p  pI have looked through several other guides on the internet but none of them seem to make sense to me.p  pHere is what would be of great help to me, if someone could tell me what sort of method is commonly used to implement the graphics of a game like angrybirds, specifically the multiple collisions method is mine good enough or do i need to do speculative contacts like wildbunny talks about in his blog, and the box resting on box problem.p  pIs this project difficult to do withing two weeksp

Ive tried a whole bunch of things with annotations and fluent api but I havent really gotten anywhere.p  pThe actual business case here is having a view displaying information from the BuildingUnit class, and then on that page it is possible to click a button and pop up a modal to add insurance information. Clicking the add insurance button on that modal will post the insurance information to the controller and at that point it should be saved and the relationship should be created between the BuildingUnit and the BuildingUnitInsurance. Any help with the controller code would be great too since I dont really know what I would have to do there to make those relationships happen.p
Negative 6439 pIm trying to come up with a nice in terms of coding amp apperance way of deleting a section from a table view. Ideally I would like to create a way of deleting sections that is similar to that of the process for deleting a codeUITableViewCellcode ie. the red minus button that shows the red delete button when pressed.p  pIs there any preexisting solution to this problem I have tried doing a bit of research into the are but I cant really find anything of much use. If there isnt a preexisting solution I was thinking I could try and implement one. My plan would be to create a custom header for each section. Within the custom header Id add the delete buttons that would react the same way as when deleting a row. Do people think this would workp  pSo to be clear, Im asking whether there is an existing solution for deleting sections in a codeUITableViewcode. If there isnt then Id like to know if people think my idea would be feasible or if there are any issues Ive overlooked with it.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 6439 pOn math.SE, a a hrefhttpmath.stackexchange.comq1549033733question about math notationa enerated a discussion of how programming languages interpret the set 1,...,n when n0p  pThe question asked for a mathematical notation to represent the R code code1ncodep  pAccording to the comments, the mathematical interpretation of 1,...,n when n0 is that this is an empty set. A subsequent comment suggested that C is consistent with this interpretation, because codefor int i  1 i lt n icode returns a empty set because it iterates 0 times. p  pIt is not clear to me what the equivalent statement in R is, but code10code returns the vector code[1,0]code p  pThus, codefor i in 10 printicode iterates over 1 and 0 I interpret as analogous to the C code abovep  pIs this because 1,...,n is not the correct notation for code1ncodep  pDoes this mean R violates a universal rulep  pIs there a consistent interpretation for this set among programming languagesp

Negative 6439 pI am creating a WPF desktop application with MVVM.p  pI have used a hrefhttpgallery.expression.microsoft.comBehavior relnofollowcodeBehaviorcodea to store the window state behavior. I want some dialogs to store the setting between application sessions.

Negative 6439 pForgive me to the obtuse title, as Im unsure how to describe this question.p  pRecently many iOS apps utilise a scrolling UI design pattern which helps to maximise screen realestate, typically hiding the header when the user scrolls downwards.p  pFor example, Instragrams main view has the Instragram header at the top. Scrolling upwards on this view keeps the header fixed at the top, and the view bounces back normally to the top of the content. But scroll down and the header acts as part of the content, making way for an extra 44 points of vertical space.p  pIts probably that I havent done much iOS work in a while, but I cant easily figure out how best to impliment this Apologies for the terrible description.p

Negative 6439 pWhats the best way to balance declared exports of packages from a bundle and the requirements of unit testingp  pConsider a bundle mybundle for which you want to write unit tests. The bundles source is stored in an IDEs project concept. For instancep  precodemybundle   srcjava     mybundle.package1       ...java   bnd.bnd codepre  pBy emunit testsem I mean tests of individual POJOs, irrelevant to the wider OSGi context in which these classes may be used within a bundle. Where possible, the tests should be runnable with vanilla classloading, such as by the JUnit runner in Eclipse.p  pAt development time, here are a few ways of packaging the unit testsp  h2Unit tests in the bundle sourceh2  pHere, the unit tests are added to a source folder in the projectp  precodemybundle   srcjava     mybundle.package1       ...java   testjava     mybundle.package1.test       ...java   bnd.bnd codepre  pNote the appended .test to differentiate packages and avoid split package problems.p  pTypically there will be some measure to ensure test classes dont end up in the built bundle JAR.p  h2Unit tests in a separate bundleh2  pHere a separate bundle is added, name suffixed with .test as is the general convention.p  precodemybundle   srcjava     mybundle.package1       ...java mybundle.test   testjava     mybundle.package1.test       ...java   bnd.bnd codepre  pThe trouble with this is that because the classes are separated, and the running of unit tests may not be knowledgeable of the OSGi environment e.g. using the Eclipse JUnit runner you will have to decorate the runtime classpath of the JUnit runner.p  h2Unit tests in a fragmenth2  pThanks HollyCummins. Here a separate bundle fragment is createdp  precodemybundle.fragment   testjava     mybundle.package1.test       ...java   bnd.bnd codepre  pThe fragment declares mybundle as its host, thus allowing it to share the classes in mybundle without the need of the packages being exported.p  pThe disadvantage of this is that because fragment loading is an OSGi concept, you need to run with an OSGi container or decorate the classpath.p  h1Export problemsh1  pThe problem comes when considering how bundles perform ExportPackage. a hrefhttpwiki.osgi.orgwikiExportOnlyAPIs relnofollowIt is considered good practice to export as few packages as possiblea. And yet it seems that unit testing forces extra packages to be exported.p  pThis is most obvious for the second option, having a separate testing bundle. The tests in the testing bundle must ImportPackage the classes under test, and the bundle under test must also ExportPackage all said classes under test.p  pSo the obvious solution is to lean toward having unit tests in the bundle source, but problems soon crop up in nontrivial situations. You may want to share testing code, for instance you might have OSGi integration tests in a separate bundle. To share code you end up having to ExportPackage the testing packages, and then of course you also end up with testing code in the built bundlep  pstrongWhat is the best way to organise OSGi bundlesprojects for testingstrongp

Negative 6439 pLong story short I have an executable jar, that calls codejni.dllcode which is dependent on codelib.dllcode. And Im getting the ohsodreaded codeUnsatisfiedLinkErrorcode.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma609257695656Thisa answer comes pretty close, yet it fails to solve the problem, from my experience. Even when the folder where the dlls reside is specified in codejava.library.pathcode, it will not work. I have to change the Windows codePATHcode environment variable as well. In fact, the default codejava.library.pathcode on Windows seems to be codePATHcode.p  pIs there any pretty way to fix this I want to build an installer for Windows and Im wondering how I would deal with this issue, so that the enduser will not have to do any manual work.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pWhat I implemented is the following the application ships with a folder called nativelibs which has dynamic libraries for all supported architectures. The structure is the followingp  precode  nativelibs     windows       x86         ...       x64          ...         linux       x86         ...       x64          ...         libs        ... codepre  pOn runtime, while the application initializes, the correct JRE architecture and System OS are detected and the proper library files are copied to the libs folder. The codejava.library.pathcode is being set on runtime as well using a common hack. Finally, the codePATHcode environment variable for windows is set using a native launcher.p  pAny room for improvement Maybe copying the dlls in the same directory as the codejarcode file would negate the need for setting the codejava.library.pathcode and codePATHcode variables I need to investigate loading the dlls with codeSystem.loadcode as well, which will negate the need to copy files.p

This way, the images wont always need to be titled image1.jpg, etc.p  precodeltscript type  textjavascriptgt         var days  730         var rotator  new Object         var currentTime  new Date         var currentMilli  currentTime.getTime         var images  [], index  0         images[0]  image0.jpg         images[1]  image1.jpg         images[2]  image2.jpg         images[3]  image3.jpg         rotator.getCookie  functionName               var re  new RegExpName[], i              if document.cookie.matchre                  return document.cookie.matchre[0].split[1]                 return                   rotator.setCookie  functionname, value, days               var expireDate  new Date             var expstring  expireDate.setDateexpireDate.getDateparseIntdays             document.cookie  namevalue expiresexpireDate.toGMTString path                  rotator.randomize  function              index  Math.floorMath.random  images.length             randomImageSrc  images[index]                  rotator.check  function              if rotator.getCookierandomImage                    rotator.randomize                 document.writeltimg src  randomImageSrc  gt                 rotator.setCookierandomImage, randomImageSrc, days                 rotator.setCookietimeClock, currentMilli, days                          else                  var writtenTime  parseIntrotator.getCookietimeClock,10                 if  currentMilli gt writtenTime  10000                       rotator.randomize                     var writtenImage  rotator.getCookierandomImage                     while  randomImageSrc  writtenImage                           rotator.randomize                                          document.writeltimg src  randomImageSrc  gt                     rotator.setCookierandomImage, randomImageSrc, days                     rotator.setCookietimeClock, currentMilli, days                                  else                      var writtenImage  rotator.getCookierandomImage                      document.writeltimg src  writtenImage  gt                                                rotator.check     ltscriptgt codepre  pCan anyone point me in the right direction My hunch is to use JQuery .get, but Ive been unsuccessful so far.p  pPlease let me know if I can clarifyp

Negative 6439 pDays, Ive spent working on this. Weeks, perhaps. Literally. p  pSo Ive got an image on an SD card that more than likely came out of the builtin camera. I want to take that image and downsample it to an arbitrary size but always smaller and never larger. My code uses standard Android Bitmap methods to decode, resize, recompress, and save the image. Everything works fine as long as the final image is smaller than 3MP or so. If the image is larger, or if I try to do several of these at once, the application crashes with an OutOfMemoryError. I know why thats happening, and I know its happening for a perfectly legitimate reason, I just want it to not happen anymore.p  pLook, Im not trying to launch a rocket here. All I want to do is resize a camera image and dump it to an OutputStream or even a temporary file. Surely someone out there must have done such a thing. I dont need you to write my code for me, and I dont need my hand held. But between my various programming abortions and days of obsessed Googling, I dont even know which direction to head in. Roughly speaking, does anyone know how to decode a JPEG, downsample it, recompress it in JPEG, and send it out on an OutputStream without allocating a massive amount of memoryp

Using the same spacing constraints for the image in all cells results in the image partially obscuring the cell borders for some cells, or leaving whitespace between the image and the border in others.p  pIf anyone can think of an easier way to attack this, Id appreciate it.p  pstrongSolutionstrongp  pPer the marked solution below, removing the image spacing constraints and then creating new constraints between the image and the cell.contentView did the trick. I removed the code to adjust the constraints from the codevoidlayoutSubviewscode method. I added the code to remove and make new constraints to codeawakeFromNibcode of the UITableViewCell subclassp  precode voidawakeFromNib      [super awakeFromNib]       Since Xcode 4.6.3 creates constrain relationships between the image and the cell, we need to delete and then recreate between the image and the cell.contentView      [self removeConstraintself.imageSpacingTopConstraint]     [self removeConstraintself.imageSpacingBottomConstraint]      self.imageSpacingTopConstraint  [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItemself.wineImage attributeNSLayoutAttributeTop relatedByNSLayoutRelationEqual toItemself.contentView attributeNSLayoutAttributeTop multiplier1.0 constant0.0]     self.imageSpacingBottomConstraint  [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItemself.wineImage attributeNSLayoutAttributeBottom relatedByNSLayoutRelationEqual toItemself.contentView attributeNSLayoutAttributeBottom multiplier1.0 constant0.0]      [self addConstraintself.imageSpacingTopConstraint]     [self addConstraintself.imageSpacingBottomConstraint]  codepre

So, the problem is like thisp  pI have a table structure made of four tables tables, rows, cols, values that I use to recreate the behavior of the informationschema in a way.  In php I am generating queries to retrieve the data, and the result would still look like a normal tablep  precodeSELECT    SELECT value FROM values WHERE col  3 and row  rows.id as col1,   SELECT value FROM values WHERE col  4 and row  rows.id as col2  FROM rows WHERE table  SELECT id FROM tables WHERE name  table1  HAVING col2 LIKE 4 codepre  pORp  precodeSELECT  FROM  SELECT    SELECT value FROM values WHERE col  3 and row  rows.id as col1,   SELECT value FROM values WHERE col  4 and row  rows.id as col2  FROM rows WHERE table  SELECT id FROM tables WHERE name  table1 d  WHERE col2 LIKE 4  codepre  pnote that the part where I define the columns of the result is generated by a php script. It is less important why I am doing this, but I want to extend this algorithm that generates the queries for a broader use. And we got to the core problem, I have to decide if I will generate a codewherecode or a codehavingcode part for the query, and I know when to use them both, the problem is my algorithm doesnt and I have to make a few extra checks for this. But the two above queries are equivalent, I can always put any query in a subquery, give it an alias, and use where on the new derived table.  But I wonder if I will have problems with the performance or not, or if this will turn back on me in an unexpected way.p  pI know how they both work, and how where is supposed to be faster, but this is why I came here to ask. Hopefully I made myself understood, please excuse my english and the long useless turns of phrases, and all.p  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pI already know the difference between the two, and all that implies, my only dilemma is that using custom columns from other tables, with variable numbers and size, and trying to achieve the same result as using a normally created table implies that I must use HAVING for filtering the derived tables columns, at the same time having the option to wrap it up in a subquery and use where normally, this probably will create a temporary table that will be filtered afterwards. Will this affect performance for a large database And unfortunately I cannot test this right now, as I do not afford to fill the database with over 1 billion entries that will be something like this 1 billion in coderowscode table, 5 billions in codevaluescode table, as every row have 5 columns, 5 rows in codecolscode table and code1code row in codetablescode table  strong6,000,006strong entries in totalp  pright now my database looks like thisp  precode  id  name    title      dets     1  table1  Table One            id  table  name     3      1  col1    4      1  col2   where table is a foreign key from table tables      id  table  extra     1      1           2      1          where table is a foreign key from table tables     id  row  col  value        1    1    3  13          2    1    4  14          6    2    4  24          9    2    3  asdfghjk   where row is a foreign key from table rows  where col is a foreign key from table cols  codepre  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pThe conditions are there just for demonstration purposesp  pstrongEDIT 3strongp  pFor only two rows, it seems there is a difference between the two, the one using having is 0,0008 and the one using where is 0.00140.0019. I wonder if this will affect performance for large numbers of rows and columnsp  pstrongEDIT 4strongp  pThe result of the two queries is identical, and that isp  precode  col1      col2    13        14     asdfghjk  24     codepre
Negative 6439 pI have a linq query in which I need to be able to select an variable number of fields from a datatable.  I do know all of the fields that could be included, but only two will for sure be in the datatable.  I also will know which fields are included in the datatable it will just be different depending on the users selections.  Right now I set up something like thisp  precodevar query  from item in dt.AsEnumerable             group item by item.FieldltstringgtID into g             select new                              ID  g.Key, required                 Status  g.Mini gt dostuffi,Status, not required                 Disc  g.Mini gt dostuffi,Disc, not required                 Loc  String.Joinltstringgt,, from i in g select i.FieldltstringgtLoc required               dostuffDataRow i,string field      try              return i.Fieldltstringgtfield            catch              return null       codepre  pSo dostuff basically is just checking whether or not that field exists in the dataset, and then I would just need to ignore the nonexistant fields when working with the query results, which would not be too difficult.  However, it seems like there is probably a better way to do this, but Ive had a tough time finding anything via Google about using a dynamic select clause.p

Negative 6439 pI have a search server that provides a test page where I can input a query and it returns the results in XML. I want to be able to go through the results in a more user friendly way so I started playing around with XSLT and I have a simple stylesheet now that turns a somehow bloated XML into a simple table showing just some of the data. This works fine when I do it locally  that is, adding the XSL declaration to the XML and then opening the XML in a browser like Firefox.p  pWhat I want to do though is to apply this transformation live in the browser, as soon as I fetch the results from the server through that test page. I investigated a bit and found that a hrefhttpwww.w3schools.comxslxslclient.asp relnofollowits possible to do this with javascripta.p  pThen I thought about Greasemonkey userscripts that can inject javascript into a page dynamically. I would just need a script that would kick in when I get the XML results from the test page.

Negative 6439 pI developed a WCF Service hosted in a Windows Service which would send a request to the thirdparty webservice and expects a response.So all i would be given is the urlwsdl information of the thirdparty service where its hosted.p  pI want to implement say a test service which would give response to my request and Create a single proxy of that service by adding service reference in the visual studio to the actual service.So there can be any number of third party applications which would provide their urls in the future for communication.p  pMy question about the WCF is can i create a single proxy client once and just send the request to a webservice based on the url on the fly  Is it possible to use the same proxy client for both HTTP and HTTPS by just passing the binding and address parameters dyanmically p

Negative 6439 pIm using the jQuery jTable plugin for a CRUD table within my ASP.Net MVC 3 application. Running the code on my development machine works fine. However when I move the code to the production server, I cannot add new eventsrows to jTable as I keep getting an error Form is not valid... which is being triggered in the controller by codeifModelState.IsValidcode. p  pSo next I grabbed the errors from the ModelState with codeModelState.Values.SelectManyv gt v.Errorscode and put them into a JSON response, and this is why my ModelState is invalid codeErrorMessageThe value 15082013 110000 is not valid for Timestamp.codep  pSo my question is, why is the that datestring okay for my development server but invalid for productionp  pAlso, the model which is invalid was created by EF Database First, so I havent set any DataAnnotations on my own. It seems that the default modelbinder doesnt work properly on my production system.p  pCould it possibly be due to the fact Im using DDMMYY instead of MMDDYY Its the Canadian way..p  pEDIT Ah ha It WAS because of the culture specific format, I first tried fixing it by switching the culture settings on the production environment from US to CA, but this still didnt fix it. So the next thing I did was added in a line into my codeWeb.configcode within the codesystem.webcode portion codeltglobalization requestEncodingutf8 responseEncodingutf8 cultureenCA uiCultureenCAgtcode and now things are working smoothly.

Negative 6439 pI have two small to medium sized files 2k that are for all intents and purposes identical.  The second file is the result of the first file being duplicated and replacing backslashes with forward slashes.  The new file is bigger by 80 bytes or one byte per line.p  pI did this with a simple batch script,and at first I thought the script might have unintentionally added some spaces or other artifacts.  Or maybe the fact that their extensions are different has something to do with it one has a codetmpcode extension and the other has a codelstcode extension.p  pFrom an editor, I replaced all  forward slashes in the new file with backslashes and saved it without changing the extension. p  pemAnd, hey guess whatem  The files were the same size again.p  pNow, before this is written off as a random fluke, I also see the same behavior exhibited in three other pairs of files in other words six files created in the same manner as the first.  They are all one byte bigger per line in the file.  The largest is about 12k bytes, and the smallest is about 2k.p  pI wouldnt think it has anything to do with escaping because I am on a Windows box using the Windows 7 codecmd.execode shell.p  pAlso one other thing.  I tried the following  p  precode  echo  gtgt a.txt   echo  gtgt b.txt codepre  pThe files matched in size 7 bytesp  pDoes anyone have an explanation for this behaviorp

Negative 6439 pI have been trying to connect my Windows Phone 8 app to Dropbox using DropNet. Unfortunately with little success. p  pAccording to the examples and the documentation on the DropNet Git Page I tried two different ways to connect the app the Dropboxp  pThe first was is classic solution presented directly on the DropNet Git Page. After getting the RequestToken a internal WebBrowser control is used to navigate to the Dropbox Login Page. However I was not able to get this working. Generating the token and and the request URL is no problem. But the page is not loaded correctly in the WebBrowser control. The control just flickers but does not show any content. The control is working correctly when I navigate to any other page like google or so. p  pThe second solution works pretty much the same. Instead using a WebBrowser control the URL is called directly and thus the build in Browser App is used. This workes without a problem. After the Login is complete the user is redirected to the app using a custom URL Scheme. However I do not know how to proceed after getting back to the app. The request result already contains an access token.

Negative 6439 pOk so Im trying to make a simple pong game. I have a paddle that follows the mouse and a ball that bounces around. I wrote a method codecollidesWithSprite scode inside of my Sprite class that checks if the ball collides with the paddle this works and isnt the problem. I have two objects extending my sprite class, a ball and a paddle object. So inside of my ball class Im trying to check if it collides with the paddle. So Ive triedp  precodeifthis.collidesWithpaddle  true     System.out.printlnThey touched  codepre  pIve also tried codeball.collidesWithpaddlecode and other combinations but it always says the same thing about the paddle and the ball when I use codeball.collidesWithcode codeCannot find symbol. Symbol variable paddleor ball. Location class Ballcodep  pSo if Im reading this right, it thinks that the paddle and ball are variables and its complaining because it cant find them. How can I make it understand I am passing in objects, not variablesp  pFor extra information, an earlier assignment had me make two boxes and for them to change colors when they were colliding. In that assignment I used very similar code to above withp  precodeifboxOne.collidesWithboxTwo  true       System.out.printlnyes  codepre  pAnd in this code it worked just fine. The program knew that boxOne and boxTwo were child classes of my Sprite class. Anyone know why they wouldnt work the samep

Negative 6439 pI want to have Java create a database and a user for me. I am using Netbeans so that I can see what databases exist.

If Netbeans sees it, why doesnt my Java program see it I found my error in the grant statement, so Ill fix it to be correct.p  pI have routines to drop databases and users. Here too if I drop a database, it disappears inside the Netbeans  Services  Databases.p  pThe situation with users is working with no problems.

Negative 6439 pI have been working on this project for a couple months right now. The ultimate goal of this project is to evaluate an entire digital logic circuit similar to functional testing just to give a scope of the problem. The topic I created here deals with the issue Im having with performance of analyzing a boolean expression. For any gate inside a digital circuit, it has an output expression in terms of the global inputs. EX codeAampBCampDEcode. What I want to do with this expression is then calculate all possible outcomes and determine how much influence each input has on the outcome.p  pThe fastest way that I have found was by building a truth table as a matrix and looking at certain rows wont go into specifics of that algorithm as its offtopic, the problem with that is once the number of unique inputs goes above 2627 something around that the memory usage is well beyond 16GB Max my computer has. You might say Buy more RAM, but as every increase in inputs by 1, memory usage doubles. Some of the expressions I analyze are well over 200 unique inputs...p  pThe method I use right now uses the compile method to take the expression as the string. Then I create an array with all of the inputs found from the compile method. Then I generate a list row by row of True and False randomly chosen from a sample of possible values that way it will be equivalent to rows in a truth table if the sample size is the same size as the range and it will allow me to limit the sample size when things get too long to calculate. These values are then zipped with the input names and used to evaluate the expression. This will give the initial result, after that I go column by column in the random boolean list and flip the boolean then zip it with the inputs again and evaluate it again to determine if the result changed.p  pSo my question is this Is there a faster way I have included the code that performs the work. I have tried regular expressions to find and replace but it is always slower from what Ive seen. Take into account that the inner for loop will run emNem times where emNem is the number of unique inputs. The outside for loop I limit to run 215 if emNem  15. So this turns into eval being executed codeMin2N, 215  1  Ncode...p  pAs an update to clarify what I am asking exactly Sorry for any confusion. The algorithmlogic for calculating what I need is not the issue. I am asking for an alternative to the python builtin eval that will perform the same thing faster. take a string in the format of a boolean expression, replace the variables in the string with the values in the dictionary and then evaluate the string.p  precodevalue is expression as string comp  compilevalue.strip, , eval inputs  comp.conames control  [0]leninputs  Sequences of random boolean values to be used randomlist  genrandbitsleninputs   for row in randomlist     valuedict  dictzipinputs, row     answer  evalcomp, valuedict      for column in rangelenrow         row[column]  row[column]          newvaluedict  dictzipinputs, row         newanswer  evalcomp, newvaluedict          row[column]  row[column]          if answer  newanswer             control[column]  control[column]  1 codepre

Negative 6439 pI am somewhat new to NSOperation. I have an existing app with a potentially long running task. The task downloads data via a web service. The task could take some time to complete especially in rural areas where connectivity is slow. We need to update this app so the user can cancel the download, or it can timeout on its own. p  pCurrently we are using GCD to perform the download, but a GCD operation cannot be cancelled. The class that downloads the data preferably will not be modified, but rather just treated as any long running operation.

Negative 6439 pIn my Controller I have a function called get which sends the client a file. When a user clicks a link which calls the get function it works properly. I have another function called getveeva which first downloads the file from veeva to the server, then calls the get function to send the file to the user. This does not work properly. getveeva downloads the file correctly, calls get, but the user doesnt receive the file, instead I just get a blank page.

Negative 6439 pI already implemented a solution using KineticJS of drag and drop of items from a toolbar or an accordion, it doesnt matter to a white area, a stage or canvas, the items are images and rectangles.

Negative 6439 pThe goal is to detect the bottom of a page for an infinite scroll feature, such as those used for social media feeds. The solutions already suggested mostly involve something likep  precodeif window.scrollTop  window.height gt document.height ... codepre  pThis works great on the desktop but on a mobile device, the bottom of the page isnt being detected consistently.p  pThe following are examples just to get an idea of what is happening. Both cases are occurring when fully zoomed out on a test page but the actual numbers vary depending on whether a page is zoomed in or not.p  ul liiPad Chrome In landscape mode, codewindow.scrollTop  window.heightcode would consistently be about 15px shy of codedocument.heightcodeli liGalaxy S4 Chrome In portrait mode, codewindow.scrollTop  window.heightcode would consistently be about 36px shy of codedocument.heightcodeli ul  pIn both cases, if the user was to zoom in sufficiently usually a little bit is enough on the page and then scroll to the bottom, the bottom of the page was detected and the infinite scroll goodness occurs. Needless to say, its not ideal to assume the user will zoom in to trigger the infinite scroll. Interestingly, detecting the bottom works fine on the iPad Safari.p  pIve tried different solutions, including a solution suggested in another post involving codegetDocHeightcode by a hrefhttpjames.padolsey.comjavascriptgetdocumentheightcrossbrowser relnofollowJames Padolseya to no avail. It didnt seem like James solution would help because it looks like the problem is at codewindow.scrollTopcode but I tried it anyway.p  precodeif window.scrollTop  window.height gt getDocHeight ... codepre  pA simple workaround is to just add a bit to the left side of the statement, e.g., 100.

For Example Lets say this is codeSessionScreencode one Session is  a hrefhttppostimg.orgimagexog0l04wl relnofollowhttppostimg.orgimagexog0l04wlap  pNow App requires one more feature, which is multiple Session. Lets say in Safari Browser we have multiple tab and we can switch from one tab to other. But in My app I can not add any tab because App dont need any tab Only codeSessionScreencodeshown above should be visible on whole screenvisibleView, no any codeTabViewControllercode.p  pCan I handle Multiple codeSessionScreencode using codeGesturescode instead of using tab like safarip  pFurtherp  pI will add a button on codeSessionScreencode Lets Say codeNewSessionButtoncode, it will again create one more Session just Like codeSessionScreencodep  pBut the problem is What kind of Layout should I use to display another codeSessionScreencode without using codeUITabViewControllercode OR or any tab like safari.p  pAnd User should able to switch from one codeSessionScreencode to another codeSessionScreencode to work in difference sessions.p  pLet me try to visualise you the working of App  when we double press Home Button to kill the app we can switch form one app to other app For visualise, see Pic a hrefhttppostimg.orgimage8tfqrrkr7 relnofollowhttppostimg.orgimage8tfqrrkr7a we can switch From Facebook to Skype. It is not necessary to implement the exactly same as it working, but App need something like this so that user can switch from one codeSessionScreencode to other codeSessionScreencode using codeGesturescode.p  pLet me summarise it again User able to create the Multiple Session,and able to switch from one session to other. I can not use TabViewController OR tab like Safari. I can use any of gestures for this.p  precodeAny Idea how can I start to implement this  codepre  pI also saw one link that implements TableViews inside the scrollview, not able to post here due to the lack of reputations, posting that in comments. Not able to get idea from that link. p  pI think it will make you guys more clear my concerns.p  pI am posting this question again because my previous question was closed due to wrong explanation it was declared as off topic.p  pIf it is still not clear then just comments here I will try to make it more clear. Please dont down vote or Close it. I am stucked here.p  pMy English is not good sorry for my mistakes if any.p

Negative 6439 pAs a student of jquery ui I am having troubles finding how to set a dialog button to submit.

The upper one in the form area is a typesubmit button. The lower one is created by the jquery ui dialog as followsp  precode    form0000.dialog       Var username  EMAIL0000.val,       PasswordPASSWORD0000.val,.       buttons            Sign On function  here I perform a .ajax to verify the email is in the data base. But the browser validation does not occur. .      codepre  pWhen the lower Sign On button is pressed, no browser validation occurs, all validation must be done in the jquery dialog using .ajax to access a php function to make server side data base queries. p  pFrom my research I dont believe jQuery UI has the capability to allow the setting of the button type attribute. All I can see that can be done is set the name of the button.p  pAt this point I believe my only option is to set a button in the form itself and indicate its a submit button and when pressed, the browser validation occurs, but then I have issues with verifying the existence of the email address and if the password is I can show an alert box, but not the look and feel that I want and once the processing of the is complete the dialog goes away, not allowing the user to select from one of the other dialog buttons to join, etc.p  pIs there someone that has worked around the limitation that can provide some insight to a solutionp  pI think I can remove the lower Sign on button and just use the forms submit button and maintain the processes off browser validation and programmable validation showing error messages and remaining at the dialog screen. I can move that code to p  precode btnSignOn0000      .clickfunction           move dialog sign on button code here.      codepre  pI would like to wait for some replies and avoid additional work if it is not necessary.p

Negative 6439 pI have fragmented MP4 streams of H.264encoded video which Im trying to reconstruct in Chrome using the codeMediaSourcecode API.p  pFor the sake of this discussion, I have two made such streams, both of which play correctly when included as the codesrccode of a codeltvideogtcode tag. However, when fed into codeMediaSourcecode, one of them does not work while the other one does. Looking in codechromemediainternalscode, both streams produce a bunch of codeSkipping unrecognized toplevel box mdatcode even though one is clearly playing fine so it cannot possibly have ignored them entirely.p  pIn any case, the one that fails to play get stuck at codekInitPrerollingcode without throwing any error. I want to get to the bottom of this, however this is proving difficult as diagnostic messages are printed as codeDLOGcodes and codeDVLOGcodes in the Chromium source and these are excluded from Chromes debug build.p  pWould someone be able to eitherp  ul liShed some light on why Chrome might be refusing the play the stream orli liGive some instructions on how I can see the DVLOGs from Chromes MediaSource pipeline preferably on OSX. Chrome Canary does not print out DVLOGs, while the Chromium build says H.264 is not supported, so I am assuming that the standard debugbuilding instructions wont give me an executable with H.264 support.li ul

Negative 6439 pI have an issue where a white space is being created where I think my app thinks it needs a status bar.p  pI have a codeUIViewControllercode, embedded in that is a UITabBarController. The codeUITabBarControllercode then just displays codeUIViewControllerscode as normal.p  pWhen the app first loads iPad iOS 7, everything works as expected, only inside that codeUITabBarControllercode, the codeUIViewControllercode displayed by the codeUITabBarControllercode is offset downwards by 20 pixels. The space for a codeUIStatusBarcode.p  pWhen I say offset, the codeUIViewControllercode doesnt fall off the bottom of the screen, it just gets shorter to add that 20 pixel space.p  pThis started happening after I enabled the status bar in my codeInfo.plistcode with codeView controllerbased status bar appearancecode  codeYEScode.p  pThe app only does this when it initially loads. After I change the tab to show a different codeUIViewControllercode, the space disappears.p  pAny ideas why this is happening and how I can stop this Thanks.p

Negative 6439 pI wanted to checked in a bug fix to Git, but I had already started working on another feature. I checked in the files for the bug fix correctly didnt check in the files I changed for the feature, which is not yet complete. Then, when I built the version in Git separately, I realized I had checked in one of the featurerelated changes too, by mistake. So, I first thoughtp  blockquote   pemLet me commit all the files. Although the feature is not complete, the code is compiling successfully and working.emp blockquote  pSo, I started checking in a few files related to the new feature coding.

Negative 6439 pIm running a hurdle type analysis on species distribution data which involves two fitting steps. The first step is to model m1 presenceabsence data using all data with familyquasibinomial. The second step m2 is to use positive presence only data with familyGamma. This works wonderfully until I try to predict using the second model m2 on the full dataset I receive an error due to new factor levels. I understand why I am receiving this error there are factor levels that appear in the full dataset that are not present in the reduce presence only dataset. My question is how do I work around this error so that I can get predictions using the second model on the full set  I am using mgcv. p  pEdit Updated with additional code and data. p  precode  Step1

Negative 6439 pI am trying to compare and contrast MongoDB vs Cassandra. Our project is Java based. Some of the differences i found out are p  pCassandra is highly available and partition supportive vs MongoDb is consistent and highly availablenot so good with partitions.p  pMongoDb is document based.Cassandra gives more flexibility in terms of modelling the data and also storing JSON like structures directly into it.p  pBut another difference someone told me is that Cassandra is Java stack based while MongoDB is Javascript based.p  pFrom a third party usersdevelopers perspective, how does the stack matter Considering that i work on a Java project, would a product build on Java stack provide me additional benefits If so what are thosep

Negative 6439 pMy application deals requires users to sign up before they can use the service and to do that they create an Application. The initial plan of the interface is as follows...p  pcodePOST UsersApplicationscode  Creates an application and returns a unique identifier.p  pcodeGET UsersApplicationsidcode  Retrieves an existing application.p  pcodePUT UsersApplicationsidcode  Updates an existing application.p  pcodeDELETE UsersApplicationsidcode  Deletes an existing application.p  pThis seems very clean and logical and makes best use of the HTTP verbs. However what if I now need to do other operations on an application e.g.p  ul lipActivateApplication  once all of the data is in the system by using PUT I now want the users to activate their application. This isnt just a matter of updating a status on the application using PUT, there are several additional jobs that should be done to activate an application such as emailing the HR dept. to inform them a new application has arrived.pli lipPrintApplication  when called from the client prints the application to the office printer. Not an ideal example but you get the idea Im surepli ul  pHow would I structure my REST interface to handle this type of request Maybe something like this...p  precodePOST UsersApplicationsidprint  POST UsersApplicationsidactivate codepre  p...for activate Im changing state so I believe I need to use POST. I understand REST is about documents but how do I structure my API when I need to perform operations on documents, not just get and update the document itselfp

Negative 6439 pWere using GA to measure the traffic on our intranet site and we would like to determine the geographical location of visitors. However, the stats dont make much sense because vast majority of users seems to be located in only two countries and we have much larger facilities elsewhere where there is no traffic at all.

After days of frustration I dont seem to get Moxy to perform the simple mapping. Even if I do make mistakes, I think Moxy can be made more friendlyaccessible for these simple kind of simple meta mappings. When adding multiple interfaces to the the PhoneNumber interface of Blaise its example below, I do get the same Multiple interface support error. I wanted to use Moxy as I use it in other places of the platform that concerns thousands of generated jaxb classes that work well. However, a simple mapping case seems hard.. p

Negative 6439 pI am a little confused with a behaviour I am seeing when using .NET to connect to a SQL Server. I believe this may have something to do with connection pools and I am hoping somebody may be able to explain why, and potentially make any suggestions on how to avoid this behaviourp  pI have an application running on multiple machines which opens some SQL connections to the server with Integrated Security. Then, when the account expires password requires change, the SQL connection continues to work on certain machines. On some machines, though, the connections will be rejected, as the account has expired. The latter is the behaviour I would expect.p  pThe configuration and connection mechanisms are exactly equal on all machines.p  pCould anybody help to explain why some queries work after the password has expired And are there any tips on avoiding this, or can it not be helpedp

The base API class doInBackground will return a string, theres a more specialized Json subclass that will call parent and return a JSONObject and do some parsing of the json response, theres specialized classes that extend the Json subclass and return List of custom objects, and so on.  The reason for this is if we need to swap in XML and XML processing the specialized sub classes will have both a JSON and XML implementation.  This is because we are reusing for a couple different apis overall.p  pSo I tried playing around with Generics but Im not 100 sure I understand the implementation in this case.  Its obvious when you want to do things like List and make a list of List but how do I apply it here  I think Im mainly confused about mocking up the code vs implementation, will everything just be T in the base and subclasses, than when I instantiate instances somewhere else like in the GUI thats when I specify the type of return I expect  Than I think I understand.  So what Im saying is when writing up the classes I only use T, never specify a Type and in the code where I instantiate instances thats when I specify a type and thats what the return type of doInBackground will bep  pI also want to be able to implement onPostExecute generically because I will use a callback setup so the GUI can easily subscribe to when the call is finished and process the result, but the interfact will also have a generic for the onPostExecuteT response.  So I can create new instances, pass this, and when the async task is finished it will call the callback with the result and the callback can handle the appropriate type. p  precodepublic class BaseltTgt extends AsyncTaskltString, Integer, Tgt          protected Callback callback  null interface implemented for processing response      public Base setCallbackCallback callback this.callback  callback return this       Override     protected T doInBackgroundString... uri                      do http call         String response           return response  raw string of server response           Override     final protected void onPostExecuteT result                   no overrides, same every time         if callback  null                       callback.finishedresult  forward generic result, but there it will be typed                public class JsonBaseltTgt extends BaseltTgt      Override     protected T doInBackgroundString... uri                      this will be a JSONObject returned         String result  Stringsuper.dpInBackgrounduri gives me back a string         return new JSONObjectresult                     return a json object             public class SpecializedBaseltTgt extends JsonBaseltTgt      Override     protected T doInBackgroundString... uri                      this will be a ListltStringgt returned         iterate over all json array strings and pass back         return new ListltStringgt        class FragmentFoo extends Fragment implements Callback      Override     protected void onViewCreate...

Otherwise all we can do is all the logic in the GUI or have another middle layer of wrappers...This is all just a primitive example illustrating my point and how we want this to work.p

Negative 6439 pSo Ive got a cell that Id like to colour orange if the date in that cell lets say that cell is C1 is later than a date in a cell lets say B1 somewhere on that same row. I can conditional format C1 to do this. All good. But then Id like to create an indeterminate amount of rows like this. The two dates which I want to compare are in the same column in every row, but are compared per row. So one date in C1 will compare to B1. Another in C2 will compare to B2. There doesnt seem to be a conditional formatting technique to achieve this. Helpp  pP.s A few things Ive tried is using If statements but I cant seem to work out how to do it. Ive also tried conditionally formatting one row and then using insert to replicate the condition formatting of the row above it but this seems to start comparing the inserted row to the date in the row above...p

Negative 6439 pIm trying to get a search bar and its scope in the navigation bar, as the way the view first appears. If you simply drag a UISearchBar onto you table view controller in interface builder, its placed in your table like a header cell. Then, when you tap it, it animates into the formation Im after below. The problem is I want it to start out this way without any tapping, with a back button on the left and no cancel button on the rightp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPsgeh.png altenter image description herep  pSo, to give the search bar immediate focus without tapping, I tried adding code[searchBar becomeFirstResponder]code in viewDidLoad which doesnt work. Next I triedp  precodeself.searchDisplayController.displaysSearchBarInNavigationBar  YES codepre  pThe search bar will indeed display in the navigation bar but the scope bar is gone, WHY APPLE WHY and there is an awkward gap. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7il8J.png altenter image description herep  pIve also tried subclassing UINavigationBar and making it taller. Its easy to change its size but the contents align at the bottom of the bar and overlap anything you try to add to it. p  pSo to reiterate, I need the search bar to display in the navigation bar with a scope control when the view first appears, without any tapping by the user. I should also specify that this is on a UITableViewController because the page has a UIRefreshConrol, so simply dropping a toolbar in above the table view isnt an option. Thanks.p

Negative 6439 pi am trying to write SELECT statement which would return some elements  date difference between current time and datecreated or dateedited. If field was edited i should grab dateedited from other table which updates after editing element, if it was not i should grab datecreated from current one because that element do not have relationship with other edited elements table, and calculate DATEDIFFNOW, datecreateddateedited. I have written select which brings me edited elements with correct date, and other select which brings all elements just if they were edited it brings me incorrect date difference. So all in all i need to form single table which brings me elements with calculated date difference.p  precodeSELECT table1.name, table1.salesstage, users.username, DATEDIFFNOW, table1edit.dateedited as DaysOnStage FROM table1 join users on table1.assigneduserid  users.id join table1edit on table1.id  table1edit.parentid WHERE table1.salesstage  table1edit.aftervaluestring codepre  pThis one brings all edited values with correct date calculated.p  precodeSELECT table1.name, table1.salesstage, users.username, DATEDIFFNOW, table1.datecreated as DaysOnStage FROM table1 join users on table1.assigneduserid  users.id codepre  pThis one brings me all elements but if they were edited ofcourse with bad date difference. Need somehow to combine these selects and form single table. Thanks in advance p

Negative 6439 pIm running into an unpleasant issue I dont know how to solve properly.p  pScenario p  pMainActivity has a method handleIncomingIntentp  pThis method parses the Extras coming in the incoming intent for service, or broadcast receiver and opens Child Activities based on an intent data. So, when the incoming Intent has data of type A it will startActivityActivityA.class, if of type B then startActivityActivityB.class if no data it will stay in MainActivityp  pProblem is when device is low on memory, MainActivity is destroyed, while in ActivityA or ActivityB. p  pTherefore when BackButton is used  the MainActivity gets restored and its incoming Intent is restored at the same state as before handling it despite the fact Im doing incomingIntent.removeExtrasKEY in the end of my handleIncomingIntent method. So the outcome is  its starting the Child Activity once again and its a loopp  pI realize that I can store some isIntentConsumed flag into memory inside onDestroy and then read it restoreSavedState and use it to dismiss the intent since its already consumed.p  pI just feel there must be a better way than a bandaid that I just described.p  pKind Regards,  Pavelp

Negative 6439 pI made an EF project DB first some time ago, using the legacy ObjectContext template.  This generates everything into one massive honkin file.  There are a few downsides to this, like if I ever want to view the file, the IDE takes a while to load it all into memory, and modifications take a while to refresh.  Plus it makes things difficult to see at a glance in source control history if I want to know what changed, I have to do a file diff between two versions of one enormous file, rather than simply seeing the changes in isolated files, generated as one per class.p  pSo I decided to try tinkering with creating a code template that will generate the strongidenticalstrong code, only with one file per class.

Negative 6439 pOk, so my friend and I have been working on this for a while and just couldnt figure out what the bug is. Basically, the story is we want to start with a list view of messages, and when you click on one of the messages you go to a detail page.

Negative 6439 pmy quest is to swap position of 2 modules in left column. I read that normally I should do this in administration panel  live edit The problem is that prestashop used by this web was little bit edited, some modules were deleted, so live edit does not work.p  pIn code i found, that both modules are displayed from variable HOOKLEFTCOLUMN Front controller assignes to this variable following datap  precodeHOOKLEFTCOLUMN gt thisgtdisplaycolumnleft  HookexecdisplayLeftColumn  , codepre  pI found that this gets from database names of modules, unfortunatelly I do not have access into the database  I was also searching in both modules and did not find that one includes another one.p  pSo my question is Does prestashop call modules in order they are set in database or is there any other way I can swap their positions.p  pThank you for your answers.p

Like this onep  precodeltphp namespace UserBundleEntity  use DoctrineORMMapping as ORM     UserBundleEntityStudent     ORMEntity   class Student extends User   codepre  pWithin this setup everything is just working fine. Now other bundles, seen as individual modules, should add up columns from the subclasses. Therefor I like to inherit from these classes like student.

Negative 6439 pI cant understand this question.p  pThe content of the top of memory stack is 5320. The content of the stack pointerSP is 3560.

Negative 6439 pI have an Intel Edison that I would like to use as a USB device capable of responding to queries made by a host. Currently, it is serving as a USB device providing functionality such as a serial com port, and a filesystem as well as providing power.

Alternatively, I could create another virtual com port to communicate with the host over serial. p  pHowever, I have scoured the internet, and poured over libusb, and still have no idea as to how I would do this.

Negative 6439 pMy understanding was, that each workgroup is executed on the GPU and then the next one is executed.p  pUnfortunately, my observations lead to the conclusion that this is not correct.  In my implementation, all workgroups share a big global memory buffer. All workgroups perform read and write operations to various positions on this buffer.p  pIf the kernel operate on it directly, no conflicts arise.  If the workgroup loads chunk into local memory, performe some computation and copies the result back, the global memory gets corrupted by other workgroups. p  pSo how can I avoid this behaviour p  pCan I somehow tell OpenCL to only execute one workgroup at once or rearrange the execution order, so that I somehow dont get conflictsp

Negative 6439 pWe are developing a CUDAbased system for a large statistical analysis. p  pI have a dualsocket motherboard, where each socket is assigned different PCI slots. 2x x16, 1 x8 for each LGA 2011 CPU i.e. 40 lanes each. My question is Can 1 CPU access GPUs on the others PCI slots p  pObviously, since each each CPU only has 40 lanes, thats the max bandwidth available for data motion. And part of the program is multiprocess, so we can utilize both CPUs and their GPUs. p  pBut other parts are single process, and could make use of all available GPU resources data contention aside if available. p  pThe other option is just buying a different MB with PLX support. p  pId test it, but we currently only have 1 CPU installed, and Id rather use the  to buy a different chassis and boardwith PLX switching, if this wont work.p  pThanksp
