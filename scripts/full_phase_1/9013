Positive 9013 pSo in my quest to get Stripe integrated, I find myself confused about how to properly use secret keys and environmental variables. To my understanding, I do NOT want to explicitly include my secret key in any public place and should be using a environmental variable instead.

I get the error still if I go and test making wwwdata a superuser for the web server so I dont think it is a problem with permissions and is a problem with pathing. The documentation for the NCBI standalone blast dictates an appendage to the PATH variable and an introduction of another env variable to the database files in the same folder as the executable file. Currently, I have added the path location to the bin where the executable file is stored as an addition to the PATH variable in etcenvironment on my web server and added the other environment variable and I have also tried adding the another Environment variable to etcapache2envvars but I am still unable to execute. Thus I am wondering if anyone knows definitively where I should create additional environment variables or specify paths for Apache p

Negative 9013 pI am writing an internal Java Applet to do file uploads via HTTP.  I started using the built in ClientHttpRequest which worked great if I want to post one after another.  When I try to have multiple threads post at the same time, something on the server side freaks out and the connection will hang for large files while still uploading the smaller files.  Large seems to be around 10 megs  After lots of looking, I would not able to find a timeout that I could set to recover from this error, but finally found ClientHttp from Apache which DOES provide a mechanism to set a timeout.  The problem with it is that while it claims to be able to work in a multithreaded program, it actually only does one request after another.  I have found lots of example code for HttpClient which says it will work for multiple threads and have made adjustments to my code to incorporate those changes, but none of them make any difference, and I am still stuck with essentially 1 thread.p  pWhile multiple threads really are not required for release HttpClient does seem to be a bit faster than ClientHttpRequest, it would be really nice to get that extra speed boost since there are a lot of smaller files that could be sent at the same time.p  pThe files are being sent over HTTP because we want to use the same authentication of the already logged in user using their session cookies.p  pSo I am looking for either a way to set a timeout with ClientHttpRequest or code for HttpClient that will actually send multiple requests at the same time as promised.p  pI am sharing the same HttpClient instance between threads and using the multithreaded connection manager it wont even work without this like the docs say and it doesnt help.p  pAny help would be appreciated and let me know if you need any clarifications.p
Negative 9013 pI have a thread running in the background that is reading events from an input device in a blocking fashion, now when I exit the application I want to clean up the thread properly, but I cant just run a pthreadjoin because the thread would never exit due to the blocking IO.p  pHow do I properly solve that situation Should I send a pthreadkilltheard, SIGIO or a pthreadkilltheard, SIGALRM to break the block Is either of that even the right signal Or is there another way to solve this situation and let that child thread exit the blocking readp  pCurrently a bit puzzled since none of my googling turned up a solution.p  pThis is on Linux and using pthreads.p  pEdit I played around a bit with SIGIO and SIGALRM, when I dont install a signal handler they break the blocking IO up, but give a message on the console IO possible but when I install a signal handler, to avoid that message, they no longer break the blocking IO, so the thread doesnt terminate. So I am kind of back to step one.p

Negative 9013 pI am trying to help a small business that has an application that could benefit from occasional or temporary database expertise.  The problem is, this company has all their IP in this database, so they are rightfully hesitant to give someone access it.  p  pThey would typically meet and gain trust in person, but the talent pool within physical proximity to them is pretty limited.  I would like to think that they could still somehow tap into the global DBA expertise though...p  pEven the crappiest DBA will be able to dance SQL Circles around these guys  so exposing only pieces of the database doesnt sound feasible to me, but I am hoping I just dont know how. p  pAnyone have any tips on how they could find a trustworthy company or individual  When I hire a programmer, I start them on basic stuff that if they mess up wont hurt too much.  With a database, is there something that I can start with that can limit their exposure.  Maybe Profiler output for analysis or somethingp

Negative 9013 pAfter a down vote, I humbly realized that my post was an enormous emrantem. So Ive edited it and summed this down to just the question Id really like to know.

Negative 9013 pI am trying to load a nonbmp image png in my case into a BitmapImage instance from a resource in my app. Since the Bitmap constructor only has an overload for a bitmap resource, this is what ive came aroundp  pI allocate memory on the global heap, and then copy the resource data into it. Then I create an IStream for that global memory block using CreateStreamOnHGlobal and use the ImageBitmap constructor that takes that stream. Basically it works, although i am not sure that this is the best way to do it Ive noticed that if I free that memory block after creating the image, it wouldnt be drawn Calling DrawImage wont produce anything. Which raises two questionsp  ol lipHow do I manage the lifetime of that memory block I doubt it would get deallocated upon the images destruction.pli lipDoes the ImageBitmap class uses the png data in its compressed form and translates it into raw data on each call to DrawImage Seems very unefficient.pli ol  pAny sugestionsp
Negative 9013 pIn the world of Java, BEA now Oracle has created LiquidVM which doesnt require an OS.

Negative 9013 pone of the fields on my form is a textbox that the user types an id. this is the foreign key to another table so I need to bounce the data against that table before letting them submit. Id rather not use textchanged as every letter they type may incur another query, focus lost would only show an error or validate when they are already in another field not sure if it would fire if they just clicked submit.p  pI would prefer not to force someones focus to stay in that field, but perhaps thats the best wayp  pIs there a method to sleep and wait to see if there is another incoming key event within X seconds if so can I peek to see if its a letter or number vs a tab or returnp  pIs there another event I should be hooking thats user friendlyp  pShould I pull down a copy of that column of the table and real time compare there I could handle adding a refresh button to pull a new cachep

Negative 9013 pIm wondering if productivity can be correlated to whether a programmer is a native English speaker or not. I work in Japan and I can tell you that Japanese programmers struggle in getting the English part of a language reserved keywords, function names, tutorials etc, its just not natural for them and their thinking process is slow down by a language mapping overhead. Can you share your experience in dealing with nonnative English speaker programmers, is it easy to overcome this barrier or will native English speakers forever have a little advantagep

Negative 9013 pI know that in WPF, FontSize  196 of an inch same as 1 pixel I think.  Is the FontSize dimension the height, the width, or diagonal size of a character  I would guess its the font height, but the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.controls.control.fontsize.aspx relnofollowMicrosoft documentationa doesnt really indicate what it is.p  pAlso, is there an easy way to get the height and width of a font sizep  pstrongAnswerstrong So it looks like the FontSize is the height, and the width can only be determined without knowing the actual character on monospaced fonts since proportional fonts have varying widths.p

Negative 9013 pIve got an eventdriven network server program.  This program accepts connections from other processes on other hosts.  There may be many shortlived connections from different ports on the same remote IP.p  pCurrently, Ive got a codewhile1code loop which calls codeacceptcode and then spawns a thread to process the new connection.  Each connection is closed after the message is read.  On the remote end, the connection is closed after a message is sent.p  pI want to eliminate the overhead of setting up and tearing down connections by caching the open socket FDs.  On the sender side, this is easy  I just dont close the connections, and keep them around.p  pOn the receiver side, its a bit harder.  I know I can store the FD returned by codeacceptcode in a structure and listen for messages across all such sockets using codepollcode or codeselectcode, but I want to simultaneously both listen for new connections via codeacceptcode strongandstrong listen on all the cached connections.p  pIf I use two threads, one on codepollcode and one on codeacceptcode, then when the codeacceptcode call returns a new connection is opened, I have to wake up the other thread waiting on the old set of connections.  I know I can do this with a signal and codepselectcode, but this whole mess seems like way too much work for something so simple.p  pIs there a call or superior methodology that will let me simultaneously handle new connections being opened and data being sent on old connectionsp

Negative 9013 pa lot of commandline .exe applications i use allow you flag optional inputs e.g. program.exe o outputfile.txt f F where o indicates an optional output file name different to the default, and where F indicates another option about the script. p  pso far ive been using the sys.arg[] variables to input file names and such to my python scripts, but that has to be in a set order is it possible to have flagged inputs into python scriptsp  p[this all comes about because i accidentally put input name and output name in the wrong order and overwrote my input file]p

Negative 9013 pI have a large Group which contains two rulers and labels for distances, and a varied amount of smaller groups consisting of images and labels. Now my task is to print the large group on a page with a header and a footer. The large group extends outside the edge of the page and pushes the footer off the page. If I was printing just the Group, I could use p  precodeprintJob.addObjectmyView, FlexPrintJobScaleType.SHOWALL  codepre  pto fit it all on one page, but that would scale the header and footer as well, which I dont want  Ill be printing more pages and want the header and footer sizes to stay the same.p  pIs there a way to scale only the group and its contents automatically before printingp

Negative 9013 pIn my database table I have a DATETIME field called startdatetime.p  pThe time portion is always stored based on 5 min intervals, with no seconds, for example 152500 or 121000 or 173000p  pNow I need to set up a CRON task which will send out an email exactly 2 days before startdatetime.p  pThere are a couple of issues herep  p1 First of all I need to FIND all records with a startdatetime that is exactly 2 days before NOW i.e. the time of running the queryp  p2 It should ignore any records that are more than, or less than 2 days away. Considering the times are based on 5 min intervals, I can only assume the CRON task would have to run every 5 mins This could be a problem because my hosting provider only allows a CRON to run once every hour max.p  pSo what is the best way to approach thisp

Negative 9013 pThe first thing i would like to say is that this is not exactly what I am trying to achieve.

I find that to be completely wrong. I would also like to note that if i only select TermDate and SourceSystemID instead of  that I get results in about 1 seconds.p  pIs there a reason that when using a variable instead of hard coding a value into the where that it is taking so much longer I am completely stumped on this and any help would be very much appreciated.p  pThanksp  pChristopher Hawsp
Negative 9013 pA brief background Im working on a webbased drawing application and need to draw 1px thick splines that pass through their control points.p  pThe issue Im struggling with is that I need to draw each of the pixels between p1 and p2 as if I were using a 1px pencil tool. So, no antialiasing and one pixel at a time. This needs to be done manually without the use of any linecurve library code as my brush system depends upon having a pixel coordinate to apply the brush tip to the canvas.p  pEssentially, I need to combine the one pixel stepping from something like the Bresenham algorithm with the coordinates returned by the CatmullRom equation. Im having trouble because the CatmullRom points are not uniformly distributed so I cant just say there should be 100 pixels in the curve and run the equation 100 times. I tried using an estimated starting value of the maximum of the X and Y deltas and filling in the gaps with Bresenham, but due to rounding I still end up with some dirty sections ie. the line is clearly moving up and to the right but I still get two pixels with the same Y component, resulting in a fat section of the line.p  pIm positive this has been solved because nearly every graphics program that draws splines has to support the clean pixel curves that Im after. After quite a bit of math research, though, Im a bit confused and still without a solution. Any advicep  pEDIT Heres an example of a curve that I might have to renderp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9Qlom.jpg altalt textp  pWhich might have an expected result looking like this note that this is an estimatep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtOeuw.jpg altalt textp  pUsing the CatmullRom spline equation, we need four points to create a segment. P0 and P3 are used as tangents for incoming and outgoing direction from the P1P2 segment. With a CatmullRom spline, the blue section is all that gets interpolated as t moves from 0 to 1. P0 and P3 can be duplicated to ensure that the green portion gets rendered, so that is not an issue for me.p  pFor simplicitys sake, I need to render the pixels on the curve between P1 and P2, given that I have tangents in the form of P0 and P3. I dont necessarily need to use CatmullRom splines, but they seem to be the right tool for this job being that control points must be passed through. The nonuniform distribution of interpolation points is whats throwing me for a loop.p  pEDIT2 Heres an example of what I mean when I say my resulting curve is dirtyp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdZICf.jpg altalt textp  pThe red arrows point out a few locations where there should not be a pixel. This is occurring because the X and Y components of the coordinate that get calculated do not change at the same rate. So, when each of the components gets rounded so I have an exact pixel location it can be the case that either X or Y doesnt get bumped up because the calculated coordinate is, say, 42.4999, 50.98. Swapping the round for a floor or ceil doesnt solve the problem, as it just changes where it occurs.p

Negative 9013 pIm looking for Wikpediastyle references to designs and implementations of lightweight publishsubscribe mechanisms that actually work. I will   update the question according to the answers and comments, and to my own research.p  pI researched my books and the Web for work done in Python and Delphi for publishsubscribe,  and wasnt happy with the results. The designs relied on function signatures or bitmaps or emslotsem for filtering messages or deciding what should be delivered to who, and were either too restrictive bound to a messaging server, or too promiscuous everyone can subscribe to anything.p  pstrongI dont want to write my own. I want to find something thats already welldesigned, debated, and fieldproven.strongp  pToday I implemented a design in Delphi Pascal because Delphi was what I needed first. Dispatching on argument type, as this API does, is not an original idea it is explained the emDesign Patternsem codeVisitorcode pattern, and I think I have seen something like this before but I dont remember where Taligent.

Negative 9013 pWhile it is readily documented that NULLs take up only 1 bit in the postgresql tuple header for the row, how much space does NULLs take up in the INDEX of a nullable column not the tuple, but the index Is it the same 1 bit within the index as in the tuple, or is it the full column data type size EG integer  4 bytesp  pThe context for the question is that I have a postgresql table that has 3 referencing columns EG fooid, barid and bazid and for any row, only one of those columns would have a value the other 2 columns would be NULL. However, I need all 3 columns to be indexed. Assuming that each column is an integer 4 bytes in postgresql, each row should occupy 4 bytes for the nonnull column plus 2 bits for the 2 null columns. However, if I were to add indexes for all 3 columns, the storage for the 3 indexes would either be 12 bytes if the index takes up the full 4 bytes for a null value or the same 4 bytes  2 bits as in the tuple itself.p

Negative 9013 pI have 2 types of site. The first is a data site, containing lots of items, updated centrally. The 2nd is a clone of the first, which can be modified by local admin to reflect local needs.p  pI want my local admin to be able to approve changes pushed through from the data site, but not to have access to any security tools managed centrally for all sites. So I have roles for my data site and different roles for my cloned sites. My local site admins should only have read acess to the data site.p  pThe problem is, that though Ive removed access to security tools for my local admins, if there is a change to item security for one of the data site items theyve cloned then this is pushed to them as a change they can reviewacceptreject. My local admins dont have administrate access to the local clone site so they shouldnt be able to do this. However, they can accept the change, in which case their clone will now have the same access settings as the item it was cloned from. This actually means that my local admin now only has readonly access to the clone.p  pIs there any way to turn this off, while still allowing local admins to accept content changesp

Negative 9013 pI am trying to add logging to a dll that seems to be get stuck running.  I have tried simply adding a couple subroutines to log to a filep  precodeSub PrepareLoggingByVal strAppName As String   Dim objFS As FileSystemObject   Dim objFolder As Folder   Dim objFile As File    Set objFS  New Scripting.FileSystemObject   gstrAppName  strAppName   If Not objFS.FolderExistsstrLOGPATH amp gstrAppName Then     objFS.CreateFolder strLOGPATH amp gstrAppName   End If    Set objFolder  objFS.GetFolderstrLOGPATH amp gstrAppName   For Each objFile In objFolder.Files     If Now  objFile.DateCreated gt 60 Then         objFile.Delete     End If   Next   Set objFolder  Nothing   Set objFS  Nothing End Sub  Sub LogActionByVal strMsg As String   Dim objFS As FileSystemObject   Dim objText As TextStream   Set objFS  New Scripting.FileSystemObject    Set objText  objFS.OpenTextFilestrLOGPATH amp gstrAppName amp  amp FormatDate, yyyymmdd amp .log, ForAppending, True   objText.WriteLine FormatTime, hhmmss amp    amp strMsg   objText.Close   Set objText  Nothing   Set objFS  Nothing End Sub codepre  pThe code will run, but it seems to just ignore all this logging functionality.  I know the code is correct, because it works in other dlls and exes where Ive added the module with these subroutines.  I tried adding a basic command to log directly to the event logp  precodeApp.LogEvent strMsg codepre  pBut that fails.  If I try to catch errors in the code with a Goto ErrorHandler sectionp  precodeErrorHandler   App.LogEvent Err.Number amp Err.Description codepre  pThe app completely fails, such that I cant even select any options after logging into the web service.  I know that the problem is not the application log being full, as it continues to have new events added to it.  Any suggestions or ideas on what is causing this would be greatly appreciate.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI appreciate the good suggestions, but they did not solve the issue.  I did, however, determine that for some reason, it does not like the linep  precodeSet objFolder  objFS.GetFolderstrLOGPATH amp gstrAppName codepre  pIf I remove that, as the part to delete old files, it works.  Id like to have that in there, to prevent hundreds of logs files being piled up on servers everywhere.p  pstrongEND EDITstrongp

Negative 9013 pA very basic question concerning dropBox integration into an iPhone app.p  pI followed the setup of the DropBoxSDK and everything works fine.

Negative 9013 pI understand that a fundamental aspect of fulltext search is the use of a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiInvertedindexinverted indexesa. So, with an inverted index a oneword query becomes trivial to answer. Assuming the index is structured like thisp  psomeword  [doc385, doc211, doc39977, ...] sorted by rank, descendingp  pTo answer the query for that word the solution is just to find the correct entry in the index which takes Olog n time and present some given number of documents e.g. the first 10 from the list specified in the index.p  pBut what about queries which return documents that match, say, two words The most straightforward implementation would be the followingp  ol liset A to be the set of documents which have word 1 by searching the index.li liset B to be the set of documents which have word 2 ditto.li licompute the intersection of A and B.li ol  pNow, step three probably takes On log n time to perform. For very large A and Bs that could make the query slow to answer. But search engines like Google always return their answer in a few milliseconds. So that cant be the full answer.p  pOne obvious optimization is that since a search engine like Google doesnt return all the matching documents anyway, we dont have to compute the whole intersection. We can start with the smallest set e.g. B and find enough entries which also belong to the other set e.g. A.p  pBut cant we still have the following worst case If we have set A be the set of documents matching a common word, and set B be the set of documents matching another common word, there might still be cases where A  B is very small i.e. the combination is rare. That means that the search engine has to linearly go through a all elements x member of B, checking if they are also elements of A, to find the few that match both conditions.p  pLinear isnt fast. And you can have way more than two words to search for, so just employing parallelism surely isnt the whole solution. So, how are these cases optimized Do largescale fulltext search engines use some kind of compound indexes Bloom filters Any ideasp

This is the code I used to write the filep  precodeFile root  Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory FileOutputStream fos  new FileOutputStreamroot  fileTest ObjectOutputStream oos  new ObjectOutputStreamfos oos.writeObjecttmxLoader.loadFromAssetmContext, tmxtest.tmx oos.close codepre  pThen I use this to read the file from the sd cardp  precodeFileInputStream in  new FileInputStreamroot  fileTest  ObjectInputStream os  new ObjectInputStreamin  mTMXTiledMap  TMXTiledMap os.readObject os.close codepre  pThe error I keep getting is a null pointer exception, which is what led me to believe that the file is not being read. I tested this method in java before using it in android and it works, however I was using strings. Is there something wrong with the code above Also is there a better method for storing these large objects Another thing I noticed was that the file on the sd card was around 3KB, but I have seen the TiledMap take a lot more space by using the DDMS, so does that mean the files are not being completely writtenp

Negative 9013 pIm in the process of developing a highly objectoriented solution, i.e., I want as little coupling as possible, lots of reusability and modular code, good use of design patterns, clean code, etc. I am currently implementing the clientserver aspect of the application, and I am new to it.  I know how to use Sockets, and how to send streams and receive them.  However, I am unsure of actually how to design my solution.p  pWhat patterns if any are there for TCP Java solutions  I will be sending lots of serialized objects over the network, how do I handle the different requestsobjects  In fact, how do I handle a request itself  Do I wrap each object Im sending inside another object, and then when the object arrives I parse it for a commandrequest, then handle the object contained within accordingly  It is this general design that I am struggling with.p  pAll the tutorials online just seem to be bogstandard, echo servers, that send back the text the client sent.  These are only useful when learning about actual sockets, but arent useful when applying to a real situation.  Lots of case statements and if statements just seems poor development.  Any ideas  Id much rather not use a framework at this stage.p  pCheers,p  pTim.p

Negative 9013 pEDIT QUESTION ANSWEREDp  hr  pSo I have a Thread controlling x and y and making it change. My problem is that when the snakes body gets put up in the GUI it puts it directly on top of the head instead of 12 spaces behind it. I know why its doing it but I am not sure how to fix this problem.p  pFrom what I understand, its drawing the body and then the head but its using the same x and y spaces...what really needs to happen is that it needs to draw the head, go through the Thread, then draw the body parts so that it does it a space behind the head because the head will have moved forward...so on and so forth...

The next involves using a TcpListener to listen on a specific port though it issues a warning saying that its deprecated, and I must include an IP address, it then waits for a new TCP connection, then creates either a new hashtable or new list to store the TcpClients. And thats all server side. Client side its pretty much the same, always trying to connect to the server.p  pSo, whats the best way to go about building one Also, should I use StreamReader and StreamWriter which some tuts use, or should I use NetworkStream, what should I use to transfer the messagesp

Negative 9013 pI have an app which is based on the Qt Graphics View framework.br Its a jigsaw puzzle game which basically cuts a pixmap into smaller pixmaps puzzle pieces and displays them as codeQGraphicsItemcodes in a codeQGraphicsViewcode. I want this app to run on smartphones and tablets. emIt already runs on the Nokia N900 and some Symbian phones. Not optimized for Symbian3 yet.embr The source is a hrefhttpsgitorious.orgcolorfulappspuzzlemaster relnofollowon Gitoriousa.p  pThe items inherit codeQGraphicsItemcode and codeQObjectcode, and have codeQPROPERTYcode macros for the codeposcode and coderotationcode of the codeQGraphicsItemcode to enable animating them with the Qt Animation framework.br I perform transformations on the items, such as scaling and rotating the latter only in the indevelopment multitouch branch, and I also use codeQGraphicsDropShadowEffectcode on them.p  pI use a codeQGLWidgetcode as viewport of the codeQGraphicsViewcode in order to enable OpenGL acceleration for the app.p  pThe problem is that despite being OpenGLaccelerated, the app is not smooth at all. Especially the animations and especially since I added the rotation transform to the multitouch branch. There are not many graphics items displayed, and there are no 3D operations or anything serious, just 2D drawing.br Im not a graphics expert at all, so I have no idea why this app runs slowly. Ive seen other games with lot more complicated effects run a lot smoother than this.p  pWhats the secret How could I optimize this appp

Negative 9013 pNew AS3Flash Builder user here. Im debugging an AS3 project using Flash Builder 4.5, and debug version of Flash plugin in Firefox. Im using a trace command, but its not outputting anything in the Console window of Flash Builder is that where its supposed to place stuff. However, Im wondering why the trace command is even needed because the Variables tab in the debug perspective contains all the variable values anyway. Is the trace command redundant or otherwise useful somehow in this environment, or is it intended for command line debugging, etc. nonFlash Builder environment. Any light someone can shed on this would be appreciated. thanks in advance. p

Negative 9013 pOk, so basically I have a jspf template file with a backing FragmentBean that I want to include multiple times in the same request page scope. When I include this template I pass it a different parameter value so I can identify which instance Im dealing with inside the template and store the data correctly in a session map. The problem Im having is any action I perform on one included instance of this template applies to all the other ones. So for example when I click a button to hide or unhide panels inside the template all of the included instances also hide and unhide their corresponding hidden panels. This lead me to realize that it is not creating new backing bean instances. It seems like Im probably misusing jspinclude but how do I get the desired codereuse of including a single jsp file multiple timesp  pIm limited to JSF 1.2, JSTL 1.1 and JBoss 4.0.4. So no RichFaces ajax trickery. And yes I realize we need to upgrade. Another battle for another time.p

Negative 9013 pWhat is a good way to share an instance of an object between several classes in a class hierarchy I have the following situationp  precodeclass texturemanager  class world      ...     stdvectorltobjectgt objects     skybox skybox  codepre  pI currently implemented texturemanager as a singleton, and clients call its instancing method from anywhere in the code. codetexturemanagercode needs to be used by codeobjectcodes in the codeobjectscode vector, by codeskyboxcode, and possibly by other classes as well that may or may not be part of the codeworldcode class.  As I am trying to limit the use of singletons in my code, do you recommend any alternatives to this approach One solution that came to mind would be to pass a codetexturemanagercode reference as an argument to the constructors of all classes that need access to it.

Negative 9013 pIm completely stumped with a problem using CoreLocation.p  pIve checked out some other questions and on Google but cant seem to find anyone with this particular problem Im having.p  pI am utilizing CoreLocation in my App and when I call code[manager startUpdatingLocation]code then the little blue arrow on the status bar appears and the service begins and all is well.p  pIn the app I have a UITabBarController, now only the first Tab makes use of CoreLocation so in my first Tab ViewControllers codeviewDidDisappearcode method, I call code[manager stopUpdatingLocation]codep  pNow here is where things go wrong, If I manually just tap the different tabs then the little blue arrow disappears and reappears as I go back and forth between the tabs as I would expect them to.p  pHowever, upon doing something on the first tab, it will automatically switch to another tab via code[self.tabBarController setSelectedIndex1]code, when this happens, the blue arrow on the status bar does NOT disappear, and even if I continuously go back and forth through the tabs, that arrow is now basically stuck there for as long as the app is active It does disappear if the app goes into the background though, but will reappear on any tab and stay stuck there as before if it becomes active again.p  pNow I thought, maybe changing the tabs programatically doesnt call codeviewDidDisappearcode, so I put a breakpoint there, but it does indeed get called.p  pThen I thought... Ok maybe if I call code[manager stopUpdatingLocation]code just before i call code[self.tabBarController setSelectedIndex1]code that would fix the problem, but that didnt do anything either.p  pNow Im lost for ideas and any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pP.S I have tested to see if the CoreLocation delegate methods are still being called, and they dont seem to be called anymore unless the initial tab is open, so it does seem as though CoreLocation has stopped. However, from a user perspective this wouldnt seem to be the case.p  pstrongEDITstrong Seems like this might be a problem with some third party libraries, so isnt really something that can be answeredp

Negative 9013 pBear with me for a moment, I want to layout the whole picture.

Ive made one managed code project in the .exe solution COM visible and the VB6 macro successfully calls a method on this managed code project COM stub.p  pMy COM stub receives the method call and runs Process.Start on the WPF exe passing in command line arguments the first time. My application starts as expected. I now need to send data from the VB6 macro, through my COM stub and into the WPF exe on successive calls. I added a WCF project to my WPF exe solution producing a netNamedPipeBinding service. Ive added a ServiceReference in the COM stub to talk to the WPF exe. Ive tested the WCF service separately with a console application and it works. Ive built the COM stub ServiceReference using the same Metadata Address as my test cases, and it constructed the reference normally.p  pMy test driver calls the COM stub method and the WPF application starts. My next call to the COM stub tries to instantiate the service client and I get the dreaded error Could not find endpoint element with name internal and contract SelectedStudentReference.ISelectedStudent in the ServiceModel client configuration section.p  pHere is the contents of my app.config in my WCF service project part of the WPF exe solution.p  precode ltsystem.serviceModelgt    ltbindings gt    ltclient gt    ltservicesgt      ltservice nameAwardManager.Service.SelectedStudentServicegt        lthostgt          ltbaseAddressesgt            ltltadd baseAddress  httplocalhost8080SelectedStudent gtgt            ltadd baseAddressnet.pipelocalhostSelectedStudent   gt          ltbaseAddressesgt        lthostgt        ltendpoint           nameinternal           addressnet.pipelocalhost           bindingnetNamedPipeBinding           contractAwardManager.Service.ISelectedStudent         gt        ltendpoint          addressmexpipes          bindingmexNamedPipeBinding          contractIMetadataExchange        gt      ltservicegt    ltservicesgt    ltbehaviorsgt      ltserviceBehaviorsgt        ltbehaviorgt          ltserviceMetadata httpGetEnabledFalsegt          ltserviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaultsFalse gt        ltbehaviorgt      ltserviceBehaviorsgt    ltbehaviorsgt  ltsystem.serviceModelgt codepre  pIve tried copying this into the WPF app.config, without success.

Negative 9013 pI have a large pipeline in google app engine that stores intermediate work on the Datastore. This quickly fills my daily quota writes.p  pInstead I am thinking of having a hash table db object stored in memcache that the pipeline uses to store all intermediate results and have cron jobs that loop through all entries of the hash table db and write them in the Datastore. I will then be using the db object to read my data and only if something is not there i will be going to the Datastore. p  pIs there a library that does this I am mostly interested in Java but python would work too.

But if I remove the breakpoints and press F5, I get an exception when my code executes webRequest.getResponse in the SECOND HttpPost call, probably because of a timeout, because the error takes about 60 seconds to appear.p  pThe exception is ErrorCode 10054  Connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.p  pThis is the class used by my Application the console application calls the method Searchp  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Text using System.Xml using System.Net using System.IO  namespace MyNamespace      public class MyClass              private string SearchId  get set          private string XmlOutputSearch  get set           public MyClass                      SearchId               XmlOutputSearch                     public string Search                      StartSearch             CheckResults             return XmlOutputSearch                   public void StartSearch                      string sInput  [myStartSearchXmlRequest]             string sOutput  HttpPostsInput              XmlDocument myXmlDoc  new XmlDocument             myXmlDoc.LoadXmlsOutput             SearchId  myXmlDoc.SelectSingleNodeSearchId.InnerXml                   public void CheckResults                      string sInput  [myCheckResultsXmlRequest using SearchId]             XmlOutputSearch  HttpPostsInput                   private string HttpPoststring parameters                      try                              HttpWebRequest webRequest  HttpWebRequestHttpWebRequest.Create[myURI]                  webRequest.ContentType  textxml                 webRequest.Method  POST                  byte[] bytes  Encoding.ASCII.GetBytesparameters                 Stream os  null                 try                   send the Post                     webRequest.ContentLength  bytes.Length   Count bytes to send                     os  webRequest.GetRequestStream                     os.Writebytes, 0, bytes.Length         Send it                                   catch WebException ex                                      throw ex                                  finally                                      if os  null                                              os.Close                                                        try                   get the response                       Here I get the exception, on webRequest.GetResponse, when HttpPost is called                       by CheckResults, if not in StepByStep mode                     using HttpWebResponse webResponse  HttpWebResponsewebRequest.GetResponse                                               if webResponse  null                          return null                          StreamReader sr  new StreamReaderwebResponse.GetResponseStream                         string sReturn  sr.ReadToEnd.Trim                         sr.Close                         webResponse.Close                         webRequest.Abort                          return sReturn                                                       catch WebException wex                                       This exception will be raised if the server didnt return 200  OK                        Try to retrieve more information about the network error                       if wex.Response  null                                              using HttpWebResponse errorResponse  HttpWebResponsewex.Response                                                      Console.WriteLine                                 The server returned 0 with the status code 1 2d.,                                 errorResponse.StatusDescription, errorResponse.StatusCode,                                 errorResponse.StatusCode                                                                                         catch Exception excep                              Console.WriteLineException in WebResponse.   excep.Message      excep.StackTrace                          return null           end HttpPost        codepre

Negative 9013 pI have a very simple text file that contains two comma separated values that is about 100 lines long.  This file is created by an automated process that I cannot control and I import this file into SQL via SSIS.  p  pMy job works very well except when there is a blank line within the file.  By this, I mean it is completely blank  no commas or other characters.  When this exists in the file, the record directly after it will be imported with strongtwo spacesstrong before the imported value.p  pFor example, if the text line contains this ABC,123, the imported SQL value will be   ABC for the first column.  I have tried to remove this by using a derived column with the TRIM statement, but that had no effect.  The REPLACE function also did not work.  The really strange part is that if I add a Data Viewer directly before the data flow Destination, the value looks fine.  I even added asterisks so that I could see the spaces if they exist, like thisp  precode  REPLACE[Column 0], ,   codepre  pThis is an strongextremelystrong annoying issue, and I would greatly appreciate any suggestions. Thank youp

Negative 9013 pI am trying to implement logging in DB table using Spring AOP. By logging in table I mean to write in special log table information about record that was CREATEDUPDATEDDELETED in usual table for domain object.p  pI wrote some part of the code and all is working good except one thing  when transaction is rolled back then changes in log table still commit successfully. Its strange for me because in my AOP advice the same transaction is using as in my business and DAO layer. From my AOP advice I called methods of special manager class with Transaction propagation MANDATORY and also I checked transaction name emTransactionSynchronizationManager.getCurrentTransactionNameem in business layer, dao layer and AOP advice and it is the same.p  pDoes anyone tried to implement similar things in practice Is it possible to use in AOP advice the same transaction as in the business layer and rollback changes made in AOP advice if some error in business layer occursp  pThank you in advance for unswers.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI want to clarify that problem with rollback occurs only for changes that was made from AOP advice. All changes that is made in DAO layer are rollbacked successfully. I mean that, for example, if some exception is thrown then changes made in DAO layer will be successfully rollbacked, but in log table information will be saved commited. But I cant understand why it is like that because as I wrote above in AOP advice the same transaction is using.p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pI checked with debugger the piece of the code where I am writting to the log table in AOP advice and it seems to me that JdbcTemplates update method executes outside transaction because changes had been commited to the DB directly after execution of the statement and before transactional method was finished. p  pstrongEDIT 3strongp  pI solved this problem. Actually, that was my stupid fault. Im using MySQL. After creation of the log table I didt change DB engine and HeidySQL set MyIsam by default. But MyIsam doesnt support transaction so I changed DB engine to InnoDB as for all other tables and now all is working perfectly.p  pThank you all for help and sorry for disturbing.p  pIf someone is interested, here is simplified example that illustrate my approach.p  pConsider DAO class that has save methodp  precodeRepositoryvaluejdbcUserDAO TransactionalpropagationPropagation.SUPPORTS, readOnlytrue, rollbackForException.class public class JdbcUserDAO implements UserDAO  Autowired     private JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate      LoggedOperationaffectedRows  AffectedRows.ONE, loggedEntityClass  User.class, operationName  OperationName.CREATE     TransactionalpropagationPropagation.REQUIRED, readOnlyfalse, rollbackForException.class     Override     public User savefinal User user          if user  null  user.getRole  null              throw new IllegalArgumentExceptionInput User object or nested Role object should not be null                   KeyHolder keyHolder  new GeneratedKeyHolder         jdbcTemplate.updatenew PreparedStatementCreator               Override             public PreparedStatement createPreparedStatementConnection connection                     throws SQLException                   PreparedStatement ps  connection.prepareStatementSQLINSERTUSER, new String[]ID                  ps.setString1, user.getUsername                 ps.setString2, user.getPassword                 ps.setString3, user.getFullName                 ps.setLong4, user.getRole.getId                 ps.setString5, user.geteMail                  return ps                      , keyHolder          user.setIdLong keyHolder.getKey          VacationDays vacationDays  user.getVacationDays         vacationDays.setIduser.getId           Create related vacation days record.         vacationDaysDAO.savevacationDays          user.setVacationDaysvacationDays          return user       codepre  pHere is how aspect looks likep  precodeComponent Aspect Order2 public class DBLoggingAspect       Autowired     private DBLogManager dbLogManager      Aroundvalue  execution com.crediteuropebank.vacationsmanager.server.dao.....               ampamp annotationloggedOperation,  argNamesloggedOperation     public Object doOperationfinal ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint,             final LoggedOperation loggedOperation throws Throwable           Object[] arguments  joinPoint.getArgs                     This should be called before logging operation.

Negative 9013 pI have a serious issue owing to a 6 month gap between creating the problem and recognizing the problem.  Back at the beginning of the year, I was asked to add some graphics and change some text in a flash only website.  The site was quite complex and I certainly was notam not up to the level to create such code from scratch, but I did have some prior experience with Flash and seemingly was able to add the graphics and update some of the internal text.  In the process of adding the graphics, I had to enlarge the mainmc which contained all the elements, including the new ones. Unknown to me at the time, but now discovered, changing the properties of the mainmc symbol seems to have disabled a complex Tweening action created in a separate Main.ac file.  I did not touch the Main.ac file and I did not make any code changes to the corresponding FLA file which contains the mainmc and new graphics, but I have determined that somehow these changes have put the crimp on the tween because I have put an older version of Main.swf into my development environment and the actions work again even though they are triggered by children SWF files.p  pHere is the

You can click on the buttons, e.g. Legal, and it will drill down to the sample topic.  In the old working version, you would click on the final topic, e.g. Litigation, and the screen would animate to stageright and you would be presented with an image of a document in english appearing to come out of a printer.  Then the user could hit the translate button and a second image in German would come out.  Clicking on Choose Again would animate you stageleft back to the primary screen.  Of course, this isnt working.p  pIve put a working version up at a dev location removedp  pI will probably remove the dev copy in a day or so.p  pI would really appreciate some help on sorting this out.p  p[edit] I should probably add that the old mainmc was 2359x1692 and the new one is 2967.65x1939.35.  The location on the stage is the same 800 x 0.  Not exactly sure how the new dimensions were arrived at as it was 6 months ago now, but enlargement was required to fit the extra graphic elements.  The client required a large area from the original developer to look nice on widescreen monitors.p  pThanks.p

Negative 9013 pI am having an issue with detecting the visibility of a navigation link within a twitter bootstrap responsive navbar when it is in the collapsed state.p  pThe root of the issue is that the .collapsed div has an overflowhidden rule set to it. This means that although the navigation ul has nonzero dimensions, it is still hidden, because the .collapse container has zero height set in style attribute in the closed state.p  pThe problem is that if somenavlink is one of the li items in the .nav ul it would be matched by somenavlink visible, because it does not know that the element is hidden by the overflow.p  pIs there a fool proof way to check visibility of element that could account for thisp  pI tried relying on elementFromPoint using the li .fn.offset method, but it is not good enough in cases where the li would have some padding, for example, in which case the elementFromPoint return one of the parents of the li.p  pNOTE  My code is thirdparty code on the relevant website, so I cannot change anything in how the nav bar works.p  pstrongIMPORTANT UPDATEstrong I am looking for a solution that is independent of the mechanics of how the twitter bootstrap collapse works. That is a general solution to the issue of determining the visibility of an element which is in the overflowing part of a child of an overflowhidden element. I felt that itd be better to tie this to the concrete problem which prompted this question, but if the current question will be deemed confusing I am open to revising it accordingly. I hope this update would be enough though.p  pThanks for reading, I am looking forward to some clever solutionp  pHere is a fiddle showing the check for visible returns true when collapsed a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netVDR3Y relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netVDR3Yap

Rails 3.2.0 and less  my application works fine  3.2.1 or greater causes the stack level too deep issue.p  pUPDATE 2 Found the issue.

I have a UserVariables table which stores important data related to the current user Im not using the session to store this data as the session only lasts for so long this way the users data is persisted across logins. I want to select data, such as the ID of the client theyre currently viewing, without having to pass the user ID into each stored procedure. Call it laziness, if you likep  pIve searched for this quite a bit, and looked at various articles, but theyre all about either global variables which we cant change or something unrelated.p  pBasically what I want to do is set the user ID at the beginning of the page load may even move this into the sessionstart method at some point and then access this variable during all subsequent stored procedure calls or queries.p  pEdit What Im after is like when you set a variable at the beginning of an asp page my application is written in good ol classic asp and you then use it throughout the page and any includes. Think of the asp page representing the connection and the includes representing the stored procedures, if you like.p

Negative 9013 pIm writing a control that will simplify some of the editing process in a dotConnect DbDataTable component.p  pPart of the editing process is being able to call BeginEdit and EndEdit on the current row. Many articles make it clear that the current row is not managed in the DataTable, however Im wondering if that isnt completely accurate or whether the DbDataDable from dotConnect adds this layer.p  pI can create a DbDataTable in the form of an OracleDataTable on a form, and attach 1 a DataGridView and 2 a set of data bound controls such as TextBoxes and CheckBoxes using the DataSource property on both.p  pThis means that when the current row changes in the grid, the values in the data bound controls also change. The data bound controls arent aware of the selection in the DataGridView, yet their values change accordingly.p  pIve looked at all the properties and inspected everything about the table but I cannot find anything remotely useful. The only lead I had was the DefaultView property which suggests it can include a cursor position, but nothing more is exposed about this.p  pThe documentation for dotConnect is pretty lacking in terms of usage examples so I was not able to find much there either nor in Google.p  pDoes anyone have any information on whether this data can be extracted from a DbDataTable component or will my component not work without associating the DataGridView as well which makes it a lot less flexible. Another option would be to create a BindingSource, but then I have to change the bindings on all the controls to use that binding source.p

The visualization consists of a graph that represents connections between what I call artefacts the nodes of the graph by what I call keywords the edges. These artefacts can be a variety  of things. For example, they can represent photos and the edges would represent tags between the photos. For illustration purposes imagine Photo A connected to Photo B by Tag 1. This means that the Photo A and the Photo B both have the Tag 1.p  pNow, I have an operation called expansion that works this wayp  pA user double clicks on a node in my example a photo and the program queries the database for every new connection to that node. In the example above if a user double clicked on Photo B the expansion would generate, for example, Photo C and Photo D with Tags 2 and 3, respectively. The problem is that this can generate a lot of data leaving me with the solution of grouping nodes. The ideal would be to group with the maximum common keywords edges possible. For example, imagine now that Photo C and D both had the tag 5 there would be a group with C and D with the edge 5. But if Photo D and E both had tag 5 and 6, the group be D and E with edges 5 and 6, and then Photo C with edge 5 edges can be repeated. To illustratep  precode                             5,6 AB gt expand B gt ABDE    1                    1                              5                                                        C codepre  pMy problem is getting this algorithm done.

Negative 9013 pFrom a video recording it was possible to extract the trajectory of the strongheadstrong of a pedestrian moving through a bottleneck. Since, pedestrians sway while moving the trajectory contains nasty oscillations that I would like to eliminate. The smoothingalgorithm is not relevant for this question   p  pThe results are shown in this a hrefhttppostimage.orgimagemt83l9lu3 relnofollowfigurea.p  pSo, my goal is to get a smoothed trajectory using the blue points called nullpoints. To do that I thought of a spline. Unfortunately, scipys function emsplrepem has the restriction that the data should be sorted with respect to the xaxis why.p  pHowever in my case, sorting the data points is not a good idea, then it deforms the real trajectory.

Negative 9013 pRight, so i have this codep  precode Byte[] bin  p.GetAsByteArray  File.WriteAllBytesCReport.xlsx, bin codepre  pNow codepcode is an codeExcelPackagecode object, which is a class to manipulate xlsx files.p  pthough codepcode has data the following command just doesnt create the file and no errors occur.p  pI Believe it has something to do with the fact that im running this on windows 7, however im only debugging via VS.p  pIm using .Net 4.5,  Anyone knows what can be the issuep
Negative 9013 pWeve decided on a version control system  using Mercurial clients and Bitbucket for repositories. But its just occurred to me we have a problem I didnt consider.p  pWe have an internal development LAMP server Ubuntu and all the developers work on websites stored on it, which means all developers share a single file source and we are all working from it. Its rare that two different developers will work on the same site at the some time, but it does happen occasionally. This means that two developers can easily overwrite each others work if they are working on the same file at the same time.p  pSo my questions is what is the best solution to this problem Bearing in mind we like the convenience of a single internal server so that we can demo sites internally, and it also has a cron job running for backing up the files and databases.p  pI am guessing each developer would have to run their own LAMP or WAMP servers on their individual workstations, commit, and push to bitbucket repository. And of course whenever working on a different site, do a pull and resolve any differences as per usual. This of course takes away the convenience of other team members non developers being able to browse to 192.168.0.100 the LAMP server IP address and looking at the progress of websites, not to mention that some clients can also access the same server externally Ive set up a port forward and limited to their IP addresses to see the progress of their websites too.p  pAny advice will be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks in advance.p

This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCPIP for Windows.   This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each  entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should  be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.  The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one  space.   Additionally, comments such as these may be inserted on individual  lines or following the machine name denoted by a  symbol.

Please see the documentation at   ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2vhostsgt  for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.   You may use the command line option S to verify your virtual host  configuration.    Use namebased virtual hosting.

Negative 9013 pI work with two computers.  One without AVX support and one with AVX.  It would be convenient to have my code find the instruction set supported by my CPU at runtime and choose the appropriate code path. Ive follow the suggestions by Agner Fog to make a CPU dispatcher a hrefhttpwww.agner.orgoptimizevectorclass relnofollowhttpwww.agner.orgoptimizevectorclassa.  However, on my maching ithout AVX compiling and linking with visual studio the code with AVX enabled causes the code to crash when I run it. p  pI mean for example I have two source files one with the SSE2 instruction set defined with some SSE2 instructions and another one with the AVX instruction set defined and with some AVX instructions.  In my main function if I only reference the SSE2 functions the code still crashes by virtue of having any source code with AVX enabled and with AVX instructions.  Any clues to how I can fix thisp  pEdit Okay, I think I isolated the problem.  Im using Agner Fogs vector class and I have defined three source files asp  precodefile sse2.cpp  compiled with archSSE2 include vectorclass.h float funcsse2const float a      Vec8f v1  Vec8f.loada     float sum  horizontaladdv1     return sum  file avx.cpp  compiled with archAVX include vectorclass.h float funcavxconst float a      Vec8f v1  Vec8f.loada     float sum  horizontaladdv1     return sum  file foo.cpp  compiled with archSSE2 include ltstdio.hgt extern float funcsse2const float a extern float funcavxconst float a int main      float fpconst floata      float a[]  1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8     int iset  6     ifisetgt7           fp  funcavx            else           fp  funcsse2          float sum  fpa     printfsum fn, sum  codepre  pThis crashes.  If I instead use Vec4f in funcSSE2 it does not crash.  I dont understand this.  I can use Vec8f with SSE2 by itself as long as I dont have another source file with AVX. Agner Fogs manual says p  pThere is no advantage in using the 256bit floating point vector classes Vec8f, Vec4d unless the AVX instruction set is specified, but it can be convenient to use these classes anyway if the same source code is used with and without AVX. Each 256bit vector will simply be split up into two 128bit vectors when compiling without AVX.p  pHowever, when I have two source files with Vec8f one compiled with SSE2 and one compiled with AVX then I get a crash.p  pEdit2 I can get it to work from the command linep  precodegtcl c sse2.cpp gtcl c archAVX avx.cpp gtcl foo.cpp sse2.obj avx.obj gtfoo.exe codepre  pEdit3 This, however, crashesp  precodegtcl c sse2.cpp gtcl c archAVX avx.cpp gtcl foo.cpp avx.obj sse2.obj gtfoo.exe codepre  pAnother clue.  Apparently, the order of linking matters.  It crashes if avx.obj is before sse2.obj but if sse2.obj is before avx.obj it does not crash.  Im not sure if it chooses the correct code path I dont have access to my AVX system right now but at least it does not crash.p

I know that would go against everything that is supposed to be done but this is expected I was trying to use a DatagramSocket because i can open up that kind of socket, send packets over it, close the socket and terminate the App. I thought there would be some system buffer holding the packets until someone calls receive on a DatagramSocket with the same port.  Would that even be possible or will the system throw all packets away when nobody is receiving them immediately p

Negative 9013 pOn my site the codeh1code tags are smaller than the codeh2code tags. Perhaps its the WordPress theme Im using and this would be an easy fix in the CSS file.p  pMy first instinct was to use codeh2code tags in place of the codeh1code tags, codeh3code tags in place of codeh2code, and so on because it makes sense design wise.p  pIve since looked around and feel based on my reading that I need to stick with the normal structurep  precodeH1 H2 H3 codepre  pHowever, Im still stuck with an codeh2code tag that is larger than the codeh1code and text that is currently wrapped in codeh2code tags that seems better fit for h3.p  pI dont understand how to approach things.

Negative 9013 pI am currently using Spring 2  Hibernate 3.p  pQuestion 1 What is the good reason to use hibernate framework within Springs IoC p  pQuestion 2 Why not separate hibernate framework from Springs IoC frameworkp  pQuestion 3 For those who experienced using hibernate in Spring 3, is there any pain I noted that Spring 3 has much lesser configurationp  pThe reason why I ask this question is that I think using hibernate within Springs IoC caused hibernate to be tightly coupled with Spring and caused the configuration file to be much complicated. Please enlighten me.p

Negative 9013 pI need to shade an OUTSIDE area, ie the shapes I draw in the shader are drawn normally, and their inverse is then shaded. Its easiest to explain with an example, and noting the bit that is not workingp  precode canvasBackground is the actual background  canvasBackgroundContext is its context  To make it simple, I will fill it with green  canvasBackgroundContext.fillStyle  00FF00 canvasBackgroundContext.clearRect0, 0, canvasBackground.width, canvasBackground.height   I also have a the shader  canvasShader and canvasShaderContext with same width and height as canvasBackground canvasShaderContext.fillStyle  rgba0, 0, 0, 0.25  Black but slightly transparent canvasShaderContext.clearRect0, 0, canvasShader.width, canvasShader.height   Everything so far is great  now the problem   This is wrong, because when I create the area I want to create clear, it does not work  because when you draw a shape it does not work like clearRect, as it does not set each pixel to a clear pixel canvasShaderContext.fillStyle  rgba0, 0, 0, 0.0   Create the only non shaded bits in the shader, overlapping rects canvasShaderContext.fillRect10, 10, 50, 50 canvasShaderContext.fillRect40, 40, 50, 50   So when I do this, it should shade the entire background except for the two 50x50 overlapping rects at 10,10 and 40,40 canvasBackgroundContext.drawImagecanvasShaderContext, 0, 0 codepre  pI dont want to go to a pixel by pixel basis using getImageData, as that is slow.

The following code does not even compilep  precode    does not compile    let z  runST foo    let w  runST  add1 z    print w codepre  pIt gives the following error among others hashtable.hs3119p  precodeCouldnt match type a with C.HashTable s Text Int   a is a rigid type variable bound by       the inferred type of z  a at hashtable01.hs317 Expected type ST s a   Actual type ST s HashTable s Text Int In the second argument of , namely foo In the expression runST  foo In an equation for z z  runST  foo codepre  pThis is probably due to the codescode constrain in the type, and my guess is that its probably there for precisely that reason. If we would later use codezcode it would not have the same value, since the codeadd1code operated in place, and thus it would not be pure. Is this correctp  pBut then, the ST Monad in this particular case is only useful for a situation wherep  ul liYou give a fixed inputli liYou calculate the new value based on it, using mutable data structuresli liYou freeze the result, making it imutable again.li ul  pAny further change requires a toListfromList that efectively copies the values and keeps the original imutable. As I am writing this, Im thinking  duh, this is the definition of a pure function, as used everywhere in haskell, and thus the use case for the ST Monad have I reached ST enlightenmentp  pSo, i guess the real question in this case is isnt this toListfromList operation expensive 2xOn, and couldnt it there be another way to operate on a copy without the toListfromList pair of functions. Or am I overcomplicating, and I should just use the IO version of Hashtablesp

Negative 9013 pIm using EC2 instance and S3 buckets for my application. In the app, clients can upload images and these images are put on a canvas. After, the client quit the app, im done with these images so they can be deleted.p  pFirstly, in my design, clients upload image via web form and it goes to EC2 instance and EC2 instace upload it to S3 bucket and return S3 url. So, in this design file is uploaded twice and i think it will not be efficient if EC2  S3 upload is not very fast.p  pIf i choose not to save them in S3 and return a url directly points to EC2 instance, the images will stay in EC2 Volume and i will not delete them as easy as S3 rules.

The records are displayed when you view the codeSubReportcode individually, and the codeSubReportcode is linked, but nothing is displayed in the main report, and the resulting document is 84 pages.  I dont know why the result is 84 pages.  The codeSubReportcode I am currently using is only 24 pages.p  pI was able to get static content to show by selecting All Sections, No Detail in the properties, but with an SQL Query in the codeSubReportcode, there should be data to display.  How can I accomplish thisp
Negative 9013 pWhen I try to log outboth using my own button and the one provided in the SDK I am able to log out. The reason I use the quotation marks is that when I will try to log in again, it is automatically logging me in as the previous logged in user. Thus, I am not able to change user. Im assuming that this is some cache issues in the web browser or something like that. Anyone know if this will be fixed when the sdk is out of its alpha Any help appreciatedp

Negative 9013 pI have an AsyncTask running. If the application is strongstoppedstrong phone call, app switch etc. my understanding is that onPostExecute will never be called. So, as long as strongcanceltruestrong is used to cancel an AsyncTask, the running task will be notified of the cancellation.

My understanding is that strongonProgressUpdatestrong runs on the main UI thread.  p  pDoes that mean that any calls to strongpublishProgressstrong will crash the app if it has been stopped Or is it just any UI updates emwithinem onProgressUpdate that will cause a crash when the app has been stopped.p  pThe reason Im asking is because Im wondering if I have to qualify each strongpublishProgressstrong call with a check for strongisCancelledstrong or can I just check once in strongonProgressUpdatestrong before actually attempting to update any UI components.p

Negative 9013 pPowershell is clearly a lot better than cmd but it hides basic functionality.  I normally use it to figure out how to use commands that I want in scripts but it breaks a large number of basic things and I end up using both side by side if I hit a sticky spot.p  pToday this was removing a directory  rd or rmdir  both of which are broken in powershell in favour of one its undocumented from the commandline cmdlets RemoveItem.  I seem to run into it all the time though  sc for mucking around with services where for finding what program is being called when you type a command etc etc.p  pHilariously I actually got the problem with sc and then googled to find out the command where only to discover that didnt work in powershell either  That was a confusing dayp  pIn some cases once you know this is whats going on you can type the full exe name for instance where.exe will work whereas where on its own wont.p  pThis isnt the case with rmdir however.  Although interestingly typing where rmdir in cmd doesnt work.p  pSo... my question is this  Is there a way of turning off preferably all cmdlets in powershell and just getting the normal stuff insteadp

Negative 9013 pI need some serious help or advise on something that Ive spend countless hours on researching and coming up empty.p  pI have a project where I need to pull data from an MDB database using PHP. I have succeeded in connecting to the database, I can query the database and display the results in a table and I can even search the database using a text input.p  pMy client wants an advanced search functionality with multiple dropdowns. These dropdowns are getting the values from the database. All this is still fine. I can populate the dropdowns from the database.p  pThe database is a vehicles database Id, Stock Number, Make, Model, Year, Price, Features etc. Unfortunately all the vehicle data is in one table. So for example, there are four ASTON MARTIN cars in the database, each with its own ID and model.p  pI know that it would be best to have at least two separate tables make and model. But the database is generated by a third party application which saves a copy of the database to the server and thats the one I connect to.p  pThe question is using PHP and AJAX, would it be possible to have cascading dropdowns when drawing data from the same table So for example, if I chose ASTON MARTIN from the Make selection, the second dropdown would only show the models related to ASTON MARTINp  pPlease see the below attempt at trying this... This script successfully loads the Make column from the database to the first dropdown, and the Modal column from the database to the second dropdown, but they are not linked. As it currently is, the first option is ASTON MARTIN and its corresponding model is CORSA Thats not at all correct.p  precode     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt            function loadXMLDoc            var xmlhttp            if window.XMLHttpRequest              code for IE7, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari             xmlhttpnew XMLHttpRequest         else  code for IE6, IE5            xmlhttpnew ActiveXObjectMicrosoft.XMLHTTP                   xmlhttp.onreadystatechangefunction       if xmlhttp.readyState4 ampamp xmlhttp.status200           document.frm.modelSelection.innerHTMLxmlhttp.responseText                              var makevaluedocument.frm.makeSelection.value          xmlhttp.openGET,ajaxmakemakevalue,true         xmlhttp.send                           ltscriptgt              ltphp               dbName  Cxampphtdocsnewdbsavvyautoweb.mdb               Throws an error if the database cannot be found             if fileexistsdbName              dieCould not find database file.

Negative 9013 pI experiment with metaclasses to generate the class with the custom special method  particularly, codecallcode. The generation of the class depends on the parameters the constructor was called with. Ive faced a strange effect, simplified example is belowp  precodedef trickself, args, kwargs     print Works  class Test1Factorytype     def newmcls, name, bases, namespace         namespace[call]  trick         return type.newmcls, name, bases, namespace   class Test1object     metaclass  Test1Factory      def initself, value         self.value  value   t1  Test11 t1  Works codepre  pIt works, but it is not really useful, because there is no access to constructor arguments within codenewcode. codetype.callcode should do the trickp  precodeimport types class Test2Factorytype     def callself, args, kwargs         obj  type.callself, args, kwargs         setattrobj, call, types.MethodTypetrick, obj, Test2          return obj  class Test2object     metaclass  Test2Factory      def initself, value         self.value  value  t2  Test22 t2.call  Works t2  TypeError Test2 object is not callable codepre  pAs far as I understand, codeinstancecode is similar to codeinstance.callcode, but it is not the case here. Using codenewcode static method of the class does the same. I have a workaround that does not use metaclasses at all, but just want to understand the phenomena. Python version is 2.7.5p
Negative 9013 pWe have a PDF document processing system, implemented in AppleScript where we call the scripts from the shell using osascript. In some of the scripts, we call Acrobat Preflight Droplets from the Applescript. p  pThis does usually work without problems. However, in some cases, where the processed document is big orand complex. the droplet returns control to the script before the report is written and the document is moved to the success or failure folder. The consequence is that the process continues, but without the moved file, it eventually fails.p  pThe workaround so far has been to add a delay after those droplet calls. This does help, but it is a waste of time for small documents, and there will always be a document big and complex enough to take longer than the delay.p  pWe also found out that the time needed for finishing writing the report and moving the document depends on the speed of the system had to be expected.p  pThe workaround would be to calculate the delay from the document size, its number of pages, and a machinedependent parameter. Document size, and number of pages are no big deal they can be retrieved in the Applescript. p  pThe problem is the machinedependent parameter, which can be determined experimentally. But how do I make that parameter available to all the scripts needing itp  pIncorporating it into the scripts is not an option, because we have a number of systems installed, and if we would do that, wed end up in a maintenance nightmare. Passing it as an argument in the initial system call is also not possible, because the calls are many, and again would lead to a maintenance nightmare.p  pSo, is there a way to set up a place where that machine parameter can be stored and easily called from any Applescript, no matter how it itself is called.p  pThanks a lot for your advice.p

Negative 9013 pIm wondering what is the best way of writing the jQuery I need. Heres the task at handp  ul liNew content is loaded via AJAX, 12 objects at a time. Each object with have a link, some text and an image. li liThe new content is inserted into an codeltligtcode element, with various classes and a codeltspangtcode element nested inside. The HTML shell is all made using jQuery.li liIm currently using jQuerys code.eachcode method to loop through the objects.li ul  pSo, Im wondering what the fastest script is for the job. I will need to create all the new HTML on each iteration of the loop, and I was hoping I could create the HTML once, and then reuse it, just adding in the different classes and content each time. I dont know if this is possible, or if this would even improve performance, but it seems logical to me. Secondly, whats better  appending to the parent codeltulgtcode on each iteration, or appending all 12 items at once at the end. p  pYou can see a very stripped down version of this idea on a jSfiddle Ive put together a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netD52EY relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netD52EYap

On another VM named VM2 I have installed another linux OS and configured the JBoss IDE to work with OpenShift. Then I have successfully created and hosted an app on my local OpenShift PaaS cloud. Here is where the problem startsp  pOn VM2 the one running linux where I developed the app I have no problem accessing my account webpage on OpenShift, viewing what apps I have created and testing them.p  pFrom any other PC on my network I can log in to the OpenShift web console and view my apps by simply entering the IP of VM1 in my case 192.168.1.107. There I can see the URL to launch my app a hrefhttplocaltest2mydomain.openshift.local relnofollowhttplocaltest2mydomain.openshift.locala . But when I click on it, I get a message saying that the web page is not available. Again, if I use this link in VM2, it works like a charm.p  pI tried changing the system32driversetchosts file so that and link ending in openshift.local will be sent to the IP address of VM1, but it doesnt work.

Negative 9013 pIm confused about the rules Pandas uses when deciding that a selection from a dataframe is a copy of the original dataframe, or a view on the original.p  pIf I have, for example,p  precodedf  pd.DataFramenp.random.randn8,8, columnslistABCDEFGH, index[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] codepre  pI understand that a codequerycode returns a copy so that something likep  precodefoo  df.query2 lt index lt 5 foo.loc[,E]  40 codepre  pwill have no effect on the original dataframe, codedfcode. I also understand that scalar or named slices return a view, so that assignments to these, such as p  precodedf.iloc[3]  70 codepre  por p  precodedf.ix[1,BE]  222 codepre  pwill change codedfcode. But Im lost when it comes to more complicated cases. For example, p  precodedf[df.C lt df.B]   7654321 codepre  pchanges codedfcode, butp  precodedf[df.C lt df.B].ix[,BE] codepre  pdoes not.p  pIs there a simple rule that Pandas is using that Im just missing Whats going on in these specific cases and in particular, how do I change all values or a subset of values in a dataframe that satisfy a particular query as Im attempting to do in the last example abovep  hr  pNote This is not the same as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq17960511656912this questiona and I have read a hrefhttppandas.pydata.orgpandasdocsdevindexing.htmlreturningaviewversusacopy relnofollowthe documentationa, but am not enlightened by it. Ive also read through the Related questions on this topic, but Im still missing the simple rule Pandas is using, and how Id apply it to  for example modify the values or a subset of values in a dataframe that satisfy a particular query.p

Negative 9013 pBefore I tried to used PocketSphinx for Android, I used Googles voice recognition API. I didnt need to set a search name or a dictionary file.

But I can only find how to set recognition for one word, Or to set dictionary The ones available in the demo project have only few words that the recognizer think these are the only words exist, Which means that if someone says something similar, The recognizer thinks its the word that listed in the dictionary.p  pI just want to ask, How could I set a few search names, Or how could I set it to recognize all the words available or even a large amount of them Maybe someone has a dictionary file with a big number of wordsp  pThanks and sorry for my bad English.p

Negative 9013 pI have an Eclipse Link JPA application that use Postgres as the DBMS.  By default, when the application deploys it builds s Sequence table that holds a single row counter.  Keys for all tables are generated from this single table.  The alternative is that multiple sequences are used  one for each table.  This will result in a structure very much like MySQLs autoincrement feature.  Is there a determinant of the most appropriate approach or is it very much a matter of style  A single sequence seems to be cleaner and simplier.p

Negative 9013 pThis question has been asked at least as many times as Ive searched for the answer but never to my satisfaction. I have a view with 52 subviews representing a deck of cards. The cards appear in the center of the screen, split into two stacks of cards and then merge together as a shuffled deck.p  pIf I call codeself.standardShufflecode from codeviewDidAppearcode, after instantiating the card images, it works just fine.p  pBut if I call codeself.standardShufflecode 2 times in a row, the second call catches the first animation in flight and and the animation is ruined. There has to be a way to block the calling thread until the animation chain completes. Timers get too unwieldy and I cant put all of my code inside animation blocks and it doesnt work, anyway. p  pAnybody have the real answer Please.p

He was too     busy for that. While the Mighty Folk were spending their time in idleness, drinking     nectar and eating ambrosia, he was intent upon plans for making the world wiser and     better than it had ever been before.ltpgt     ltpgtHe went out amongst men to live with them and help them. Ah, how very poor and wretched they were He found     them living in caves and in holes of the earth, shivering with the cold because there     was no fire, dying of starvation, hunted by wild beasts and by one anotherthe most     miserable of all living creatures.ltpgt     ltpgtIf they only had fire, said Prometheus to himself, they could at least warm     themselves and cook their food and after a while they could learn to make tools and     build themselves houses. Without fire, they are worse off than the beasts.ltpgt    ltpgtThen he went boldly to Jupiter and begged him to give fire to men, that so they     might have a little comfort through the long, dreary months of winter.ltpgt     ltpgtNot a spark will I give, said Jupiter. No, indeed Why, if men had fire they     might become strong and wise like ourselves, and after a while they would drive us     out of our kingdom. It     is best for them to be poor and ignorant, that so we Mighty Ones may thrive and be     happy.ltpgt     ltpgtPrometheus made no answer but he had set his heart on helping mankind, and he did     not give up. He turned away, and left Jupiter and his mighty company forever.ltpgt      ltpgtAs he was walking by the shore of the sea he found a reed, or, as some say, a tall     stalk of fennel, growing and when he had broken it off he saw that its hollow center     was filled with a dry, soft pith which would burn slowly and keep on fire a long     time. He took the long stalk in his hands, and started with it towards the dwelling     of the sun in the far east.ltpgt     ltpgtMankind shall have fire in spite of the tyrant who sits on the mountain top, he     said.ltpgt     lt ltpgtHe reached the place of the sun in the early morning just as the glowing, golden     orb was rising from the earth and beginning his daily journey through the sky. He     touched the end of the long reed to the flames, and the dry pith caught on fire and     burned slowly. He called some of the shivering men from their caves and built a fire for them,     and showed them how to warm themselves by it and how to build other fires from the     coals. Soon there was a cheerful blaze in every rude home in the land, and men and     women gathered round it and were warm and happy, and thankful to Prometheus for the     wonderful gift which he had brought to them from the sun.ltpgt     ltpgtIt was not long until they learned to cook their food and so to eat like men     instead of like beasts. They began at once to leave off their wild and savage habits     and instead of lurking in the dark places of the world, they came out into the open     air and the bright sunlight, and were glad because life had been given to them.ltpgt gt  ltdivgt  ltdiv idnewsgt lth2gtNewslth2gt ltulgt ltligtltstronggtPandora opens the boxltstronggtltbr gt Disease and sorrow released to plague mankind for eternity. lta hreffoogtMore...ltagtltligt ltligtltstronggtWelcome to Hellenes.ltstronggtltbr gt Son of Prometheus escapes the great flood and creates a new society from tossed stones. lta hreffoogtMore...ltagtltligt ltligtltstronggtA Tangled Webltstronggtltbr gt  Arachne loses weaveoff is changed into a spider. lta hrefgtMore...ltagtltligt ltulgt ltdivgt  ltdiv idfootergt ltpgtContent taken from ltcitegtOld Greek Storiesltcitegt by James Baldwin 1914.

There will always be a default url in the .php file. whenever the file is opened in the browser, the default statistics will be shown... only when the user enters new url and clicks submit, the stats should change.p  pHow can I achieve this I am behind this since more than a couple of hours now and not sure how to get this done. Please help me.... Thank you.p  pEDIT Can I have two .php files one for the user to enter url and submit and another one to get the entered url and echo it If yes, how If I understand this logic, i can get a start for what I am doing.p

Negative 9013 pSo some quick background information to describe my problem.  I have a project named codePearcode that contains a basic Spring project, using Maven.  I put this exact project into a SVN repository, and then imported it into this same EclipseSTS instance under the name of codeSpringTestRepocode.p  pThe problem is, this imported repository contains no Run options that the one I created in Eclipse originally has.  For example, in the codePearcode project, codeRuncode  codeRun Ascode gives the option to run on an embedded Tomcat server.  In the codeSpringTestRepocode project, I have no options  anything past codeRun Ascode is greyed out.p  pAnother thing that Im having a problem with in the difference between the two projects is that the one I imported via SVN SpringTestRepo has no little S or M by the name of the project.  Its also missing several handy annotations, such as a list of methods underneath my codeHomeController.javacode class.p  pHere is a picture to help illustrate my problem.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comj6OoH.png altenter image description herep  pAny ideas as to how to resolve this issuep  pEdit Just to be clear, its a little hard to see but just above the codePearcode project there is a little Maven M and a little Spring S symbol.  p

Negative 9013 pI have a MVC action which streams JSON data over HTTP to clients, the data can be as large of 400,000 to 600,000 records.p  pI am facing a performance issue when it comes to streaming the data. for example for 10,000 records I have managed to minimize the mapping to 1.3 seconds and JSON generation to 1.5 seconds.p  pHowever I facing a problem when it comes to streaming the data to the client, it takes about 7 seconds to stream the data to the client.

Negative 9013 pI need to write a .NET client that communicates with a Java Axis2Rampart service. The service has a security policy in place that uses a certificate on the service side. The client already has the public key of the service, it generates a symmetric key, encrypts the message with it, encrypts the key with the public key of the service and sends everything to the service.p  pThe problem is that the service policy doesnt specify any signatures and WCF automatically signs every message, regardless of the binding I choose. There is nothing I can do to change the policy, I have to adapt to it.p  pIn summary, I need a .NET client WCF or WSE that uses WSSecurity over http to encrypt the message but does not sign any part of it.

Negative 9013 pI want to create an openGL 2D texture and set the RGBA values of every pixel by its own. Can someone give me an explanation for my problem I didnt find one in the internet.p
Negative 9013 pI have collected data using Kinect v2 sensor and I have a depth map together with its corresponding RGB image. I also calibrated the sensor and obtained the rotation and translation matrix between the Depth camera and RGB camera.p  pSo I was able to reproject the depth values on the RGB image and they match. However, since the RGB image and the depth image are of different resolutions, there are a lot of holes in the resulting image.p  pSo I am trying to move the other way, i.e. mapping the color onto the depth instead of depth to color.p  pSo the first problem I am having is that the RGB image has 3 layers and I have to convert the RGB image to grayscale to do it and I am not getting the correct results.p  pCan this be donep  pHas anyone tried this beforep

Negative 9013 pI have an odd situation in which Report Builder is refusing to group some rows in a tablix, even though the values Im telling it to group on match exactly. The background is, I have a table of data with a row per day on which a person is absent, with nothing to relate one day of absence to another. I cannot amend this table or the query that fetches the data which is basically just codeSELECT ...code and nothing else so cant do anything clever there. Heres a representationp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhzIEL.png altenter image description herep  pWhat I need to achieve is to return a row per PERIOD of absence, with Period defined as consecutive days of absence. So if there are 5 rows with consecutive dates, I need to represent that as a single row in my report.p  pTo achieve this, Im using some custom code to create a hashtable with Staff Code as key, and an array of Date and a randomly generated string as value, then for each row it encounters fetch the date in the hashtable for the Staff Code of that row, and if the Date of the row is 1 day later than the Date in the hashtable for that Staff Code, return the randomly generated String.

That raises a few questionsp  ol liWhy is this behavior enforced by the JVMli liIs it important that the super class gets loaded  initialized before the subclass Cant this be ensured before the constructor is called at subclass initialisationli liIn the case of codeObjectcode, the class should already be loaded at any given point, so why the need to call its constructorli liIs this useless call optimized away by the JIT Compilerli ol  pEDIT The Bytecode of codeObjectcodes constructorp  precodepublic void ltinitgt    L0     LINENUMBER 37 L0     RETURN     MAXSTACK  0     MAXLOCALS  1 codepre  pAs you might be able to see, this constructor does nothing at all.p

Negative 9013 pIt seems like I am completely confused by OpenGL format conversions related to image loadstore. I came from DX world, where things are relatively clear. For example p  ol liYou create a texture with some specific format say codeRGBA32FLOATcodeli liYou declare an RW texture in your shader codeRWTexture2Dltfloat4gtcode that matches the formatli liYou readwrite tofrom textureli ol  pYou can also bind say codeRGBA8UNORMcodetexture to codeRWTexture2Dltfloat4gtcode and DirectX will perform format conversion in an obvious and clear way.p  pNow say I want to do the same thing in OpenGL. So Ip  ol liCreate GL texture with GLRGBA32F internal format li liIn my shader, I declare codelayoutrgba32f uniform image2D myImgcodeli liI bind my texture to image in shader with codeglBindImageTexture ..., GLRGBA32Fcodeli ol  pSo I counted four places where I specify the format p  ol liWhen I create the textureli lipTwo times when I declare image unitp  ul licodelayoutrgba32fcodeli licodeimage2Dcode itself tells me that all loadstore operations will take codevec4code not codeivec4code or codeuvec4codeli ulli lipWhen I bind image with codeglBindImageTexturecodepli ol  pI cannot understand what is the purpose of codelayoutrgba32fcode, which seems totally redundant. It seems that knowing internal texture format is enough to perform all format conversions. What layout do I need to specify if my internal texture format is normalized codeRGBA8code and image is defined as codeuniform image2D myImgcode And why do I need to specify the layout at all, isnt it clear what kind of format conversions should be performed  The only idea I have that justifies these layouts is to perform data reinterpretation like writing raw codeRGBA32Fcode data to codeRGBA32Ucode texture, which does not seem to be very useful for me. Besides, you have functions like codefloatBitsToIntcode that do that work. p  pWhat is the purpose of passing the format to codeglBindImageTexturecode is a complete mystery for me.p  pSo all these layouts is a huge source of confusion for me.

Negative 9013 pIs the following valid GNU Cp  precodeint foo const int bar attributealiasfoo codepre  pIn other words, can I have a codeconstcodequalified alias for an object thats mutable The motivation would be to avoid spurious reloads of an object thats only written at program initialization time, in cases where compiler barriers or memory barriers would otherwise cause the compiler to reload.p  pGCC does not issue any warning or error for the above, but C explicitly forbids in the sense that the behavior is undefined misdeclaring an codeexterncode object codeconstcode when the actual definition is not codeconstcode, presumably because doing so could cause valid transformations omitting repeated loads to change the behavior of the program, and using the alias seems like a way to cheat and get around the formal UB while allowing and in my case, requesting the exact same dangerous transformations.p  pIs there any official word on whether GCC supports such usagep

Seems Im its my override doesnt work, but when I vardump result[0]status, it shows. Did i missed somethingp

Negative 9013 pI have been using vagrant for some time now and have came across bugs that I would like to understand more in depth.p  pthe situation I encountered was that when provisioning a base box that I have created the etcexports file was loaded with the wrong IP, The file was given the IP the base box had while I was creating it, And once I packaged the base box, every time I did vagrant up and provisioned it there was an error because vagrant used the IP the base box had and the new box I was spinning up had a different random IP that i wanted vagrant to use.p  pSo my question is, where does vagrant or virtualbox hold that data about the base box why does it sometimes stick like that and sometimes doesnt And when Ill understand where that data is stored, Is it holding any more data I can manipulatep

Negative 9013 pI am displaying a webpage within my own webpage using an iframe. The webpage displays a graph with svg graphics, specifically circles. the internal webpage is a kibana dashboard that displays a graph This means that I am unable to change the html inside of the page but I have found a way to add javascript to elements within the iframe.p  pSome existing behavior When you hover the mouse over the circle a box with information appears which tells me that it is possible to have a jquery event triggered from the graphic element.p  pUsing the developer tools I found the alleged function that causes this effect but it is part of a much larger function that tosses references around like willynilly. I believe that there is a much cleaner way to accomplish my goalsp  pI want to perform my own event lets say console.logp  pOnce again, I suppressed the same origin policy for testing and I have verified that I can create events for elements inside.p  pHowever I am having difficulty accessing svg elements. The circles which I am trying to reach do not have ids and I dont know of a way to select by the type of graphic it is.p  pTypical solutions for adding javascript events use ids to select specific svg graphic objects or add a script within svg tags. This is not possible as I cannot alter the existing svg code.p  pCould you please offer me a solution in which a script outside of the svg tags is able to access each of the circle objects and associate onclick events Bonus points if I can target the circles with radiuses of 12 and exclude those with radiuses of 2.p  pThe html which I am unable to change with two encapsulating divs is as follows.

Negative 9013 pI am designing a web app where the server generates batches of data, and the client periodically checks whether new batches of data are available for download. The way I am doing this is that whenever the server generates a new batch of data, it is available at a particular URL. The client periodically checks the URL to see whether a new batch is available for it. I am currently not using web sockets. This batch of data is in the format of a JSON object. p  pSince I have very little web experience, Im a bit confused about what to do when the client visits the URL. How should the client know whether the batches of data at the URL are new in which case the client should download them or old in which case the client should ignore them, since it has already downloaded them in the past p  pAlso, there may be multiple clients working with the same server, so the solution should work regardless of the number of clients.p

Negative 9013 pI am using Reactjs with angular for a large commercial app which needs to scale well in future. React components will replace the traditional angular partials. What will be the best way to communicate between react components and angular controllers for things such as xhr requests, model updates Is passing the controllers this to react parent component through props a good idea or using a pubsub event based system be better.Please suggest if I should look in another direction.I want to consume angular services while getting the best of react components for rendering.p

Negative 9013 pSuppose that I want to check a webpage for the presence of an arbitrarily large number of keywords. How would I go about doing thatp  pIve tested the xpath selector codeif response.xpath[text[contains.,red or contains.,blue or contains.,green]]code and it works as expected. The actual set of keywords that Im interested in checking for is too large to conveniently enter by hand, as above. What Im interested in is a way to automate that process by generating my selector based on the contents of a file filled with key words.p  pStarting from a text file with each keyword on its own line, how could I open that file and use it to check whether the keywords it contains appear in the text elements of a given xpathp  pI used the threads a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12152890xpathcontainsvalueaorvaluebXpath contains value A or value Ba and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions472966xpathmultipleelementfiltersXPATH Multiple Element Filtersa to come up with my manual entry solution, but havent found anything that addresses automation.p  pemClarificationemp  pIm not interested in just checking to see whether a given xpath contains any of the keywords provided in my list. I also want to use their presence as a precondition for scraping content from the page. The manual system that Ive tested works as followsp  precodeiteminfo  ItemLoaderiteminfocategories, responseresponse if response.xpath[text[contains.,red or contains.,blue or contains.,green]]     iteminfo.addxpathtitle, .somexpathtext     iteminfo.addxpathdescription, .someotherxpathtext return iteminfo.loaditem codepre  pWhile alecxes solution allows me to check the text of a page against a keyword set, switching from print to if and attempting to control the information I extract returns codeSyntaxError invalid syntaxcode. Can I combine the convenience of reading in keywords from a list with the function of manually entering themp  pemUpdateexploring Frederic Bazins regex solutionemp  pOver the past few days Ive been working with a regex approach to limiting my parse. My code, which adopts Frederics proposal with a few modifications to account for errors, is as followsp  precodeiteminfo  ItemLoaderiteminfocategories, responseresponse keywords  .joinre.escapeword.strip for word in openkeys.txt r  re.compile.s.  keywords, re.MULTILINEre.UNICODE if r.matchresponse.bodyasunicode     iteminfo.addxpathtitle, .somexpathtext     iteminfo.addxpathdescription, .someotherxpathtext return iteminfo.loaditem codepre  pThis code runs without errors, but Scrapy reports 0 items crawled and 0 items scraped, so something is clearly going wrong.p  pIve attempted to debug by running this from the Scrapy shell. My results there suggest that the codekeywordscode and codercode steps are both behaving. If I define and call codekeywordscode using the method above for a .txt file containing the words red, blue, and green, I receive in response coderedbluegreencode. Defining and calling codercode as above gives me codeltsre.SREPattern object at 0x17bc980gtcode, which I believe is the expected response. When I run coder.matchresponse.bodyasunicodecode, however, I receive no response, even on pages that I know contain one or more of my keywords.p  pDoes anyone have thoughts as to what Im missing here As I understand it, whenever one of my keywords appears in the response.body, a match should be triggered and Scrapy should proceed to extract information from that response using the xpaths Ive defined. Clearly Im mistaken, but Im not sure how or why.p  pemSolutionemp  pI think I may have this problem figured out at last. My current conclusion is that the difficulty was caused by performing coder.matchcode on the coderesponse.bodyasunicodecode. The documentation provided a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2libraryre.html relnofollowherea says of match p  blockquote   pIf zero or more characters at the beginning of string match the regular expression pattern, return a corresponding MatchObject instance. Return None if the string does not match the pattern note that this is different from a zerolength match.p      pNote that even in MULTILINE mode, re.match will only match at the beginning of the string and not at the beginning of each line.p blockquote  pThat behaviour was not appropriate to my situation. Im interested in identifying and scraping information from pages that contain my keywords stronganywherestrong within them, not those that feature one of my keywords as the first item on the page. To accomplish that task, I needed codere.searchcode, which scans through a string until it finds a match for the regex pattern generated by codecompilecode and returns a codeMatchObjectcode, or else returns codeNonecode when no match for the pattern.p  pMy current working code follows below. Note that in addition to the switch from codematchcode to codesearchcode Ive added a little bit to my definition of keywords to limit matches to whole words.p  precodeiteminfo  ItemLoaderiteminfocategories, responseresponse keywords  .joinrb  re.escapeword.strip  rb for word in openkeys.txt r  re.compile.s.  keywords, re.MULTILINEre.UNICODE if r.searchresponse.bodyasunicode     iteminfo.addxpathtitle, .somexpathtext     iteminfo.addxpathdescription, .someotherxpathtext return iteminfo.loaditem codepre
Negative 9013 pSay I have a table called exampletable in postgresql with a 100 citext typed fields, lets call them field1, field2 etc...

You can retrieve it as a string by marking it as unknown, please see the FAQ...p blockquote  pTo overcome this I could manually cast all the fields to text in the sql query like sop  precodeselect field1text, field2text, ... field99text, field100text from exampletable codepre  pAs you can see this is extremely verbose and cumbersome. Would I have to manually cast all fields to text in my query or is there some easier way to configure npgsql to allow citext types in the transfer How would I handle other nonstandard extension types in postgresqlp  pAny help will be appreciated.p  pstrongBonus questionstrong I have tried finding the FAQ referenced in the exception message but I have failed to find anything.

Negative 9013 pIm making a todo list with Rails. Therefore I made a usermodelemail and password. I want that the user will be able to edit there account so I made a edit and update action on the user controller I also have a user model. Everything works great but my issue is that on the settings view the textfield for updating the email is already prefilled with their current email adress in the model. I want to disable the prefilling because of design aspects content of the placeholder should be readable right away. I know that when I will solve this problem, there will be another issue with the user model. For example if a user only wants to change the password the user will get an error message such as  Email cant be blank and Email is Invalid... I was able to modify the minimum length validation for the password if the password is blank because I knew that hassecurepassword enforces presence validations upon object creation. So I knew new users wont be able to sign up with blank passwords.
