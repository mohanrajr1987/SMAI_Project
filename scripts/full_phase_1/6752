Positive 6752 pI have what I think is a coding error but Ive gone a bit blind to it. It is possible it may be a compatibility error though or needs recoding. Please look at the following linkp  pa hrefhttpfreedomtocycle.co.ukshopformehooklow1 relnofollowhttpfreedomtocycle.co.ukshopformehooklow1ap  pAt the bottom of the product are three tags, description, specification and product tags. The first and last are displaying correctly, the specification tab in the middle is in the code and displays on all browsers apart from Firefox. As far as I can see the coding is okay and it cant be awful or it wouldnt show in any browser but Im sure its a rookie error somewhere I have missed, the annoyance is compounded by the fact the other two tabs are working. Could it be that table that is causing the problem Any ideas welcome Thank you.p

Negative 6752 pI have a bit of a hybrid situation on my hands. Im writing an intranet asp.net web app. I dont want to use full blown Windows Authentication, because I dont have proper groups set up in Active Directory to be able to authenticate users simply based on what group they are in. Up until now, I had created a membership database, and was manually authenticating users based on their NT Login. The app is getting more complex, and Im looking at using the Membership and Roles providers to authenticate users. Heres my issue I want to be able to authenticate users just based on their NT, but I dont want to use Windows Authentication. I want to write my own provider to plug into the membership and roles providers, and use Forms authentication, but make it transparent. Based on a Users table, I want to be able to authenticate the user or redirect them based on their NT alone. Is this possible, or am I stuck writing my own small framework to accomplish this I would like to take advantage of the provider framework if at all possible.p

Negative 6752 pI have an SSIS data flow conditional split transformation that is returning a  result when it should be returning a  result.p  pFrom the beginning... My SSIS package executes a SQL task that stores a maxdate from one table in variable Usermaxdate of type DateTime that has package scope.  p  pMy package then proceeds to execute a Data Flow task which has a conditional split transformation in it that has the condition codedate gt [Usermaxdate]code.  The result set is always a single row which has the DateTime value equal to Usermaxdate, that is it returns the row that contains maxdate if no more rows have been added with more recent dates than maxdate.  Which is the unexpected behaviour.p  pFurthermore, the other output from the conditional split is incorrect  its all the rows with codedate lt [Usermaxdate]code and not all the rows with codedate lt [Usermaxdate]code as one would expect.p  pWhy is this happeningp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIve figured out how this is happening, but not why.  codeUsermaxdatecode is storing a DateTime and my codedatecode value from my Data Flow task is a codeDTDBTIMESTAMPcode.

Negative 6752 pI am concerned with using CSS classes that are defined in style sheets with my jQuery selectors. The reason for this is when a CSS class is defined in a style sheet there are many reasons for a developerdesigner to change the name of the class or how it is used in the html that is detached from the jQuery selector that also uses the class. There is nothing obvious that tells the developerdesigner that they need to account for JavaScript functionality when making this change. p  pWould it be better to just avoid coupling jQuery selectors with legit CSS classes, but instead use CSS classes that are not tied to any styles and have a say a prefix like j that makes its purpose obvious that is to be used exclusively as a jQuery selector This would make the coupling less fragile at the cost of an extra class name in the markup. This would also make validation engines that find undefined classes less useful but the prefix would hopefully make it obvious that those classes serve a purpose as jQuery selectors.p  p....p  pI understand that CSS classes should be named based on their functionality. I do not however believe that naming the class that way solves the problem. DevelopersDesigners will still change the name even though their new name is still describing the same functionality, or they may modify where it is used. In these cases it is not obvious that these changes will impact the JavaScript functionality.p

Sure, you can manually add namespaces to pretty much anything, but visual studio will fight you every step of the way. With generated code such as ADO.NET DataSets and such, this gets very hard to control. Eventually you will give up and just let VS put everything in the default namespace. In large applications this gets very annoying, especially if you like a well structured application.li ul  pAppreciate if anyone could show a sample here.p

Negative 6752 pSuch a service would act similar to a payment gateway, but not actually authorize or charge the card, and would make our lives easier when it comes to PCI compliance.p  pOur clients want us to hold onto the card information but not act on it. A month later or so, if the customer doesnt hold up their end, they use the card details to charge the card by entering the information into your standard retail card machine.

Negative 6752 pI have Windows 7 64 Bit Professional Edition on a computer I built myself so there is no manufacturer to ask. I am using an onboard sound card which has 7.1 and Optical outputs. The optical output is plugged into a Denon amp which controls the speakers.p  pI have got a speaker system plugged into my computer through the optical port on my sound card. When I use standard windows drivers I only get stereo output so I installed the Realtek HD audio driver. This gives me surround sound successfully however it does not tie this as a standard speaker so when I plug in headphones and define them as headphones nothing happens the audio still goes to the speaker system and nothing to the headphones.p  pI have discovered that if I disable the Digital output device in the playback devices list the audio is automatically rerouted through the headphones. Therefore I have been trying to find a way of disabling or enabling this device. I have a programmable keyboard so I can map a program or script to a spare key therefore I am trying to write a program to check if the device is enabled or disabled then change this to whatever it is not i.e. if on turn off and if off turn on. p  pI attempted to locate the hardware IDs which arebr1.

I am happy to use any language to do this. Im sure there must be a way of doing this from c but I have been unable to locate any information on this. I would appreciate any suggestions. I am quite happy to write the program myself but if someone could at least point me in the right direction to an api or something like devcon or some way in some language to do this.

Negative 6752 pA disclaimer first This might be a very fundamental question, but I have started learning Winforms Application Development on my own .net 3.5,C, and I have this resizing question.p  pI am developing a small Winforms application that has a standard tab control along with many other controls placed in the form. It has 5 TabPages The AutoScroll property for the TabPage has been set to True. On reading up what I got to understand is that this will enable the scrollbars to show up at run time while resizing. i.e if the height of the form is reduced it will cause the vertical scrollbar to show up within the TabPage.p  pWhile the application is running, what I noticed is that if I reduce the height of the form using the little double headed arrow, the scroll bar does not stay on top, i.e if I adjust the height from below, the bottom end of the scrollbar is no longer there. More precisely I am just looking for a way to keep both ends of the scrollbar on top within a TabPage when the form containing the Tab control is resized.p

Negative 6752 pIm a bit at a loss here. Im supposed to write an implementation of codejavax.sql.RowSetcode for a specific purpose and Im trying to unittest it as well as far as I can.p  pNow, a codeResultSetcode has a cursor that can be on a normal row or before the first or after the last or on the insert row. codemoveToInsertRowcode saysp  blockquote   pOnly the updater, getter, and insertRow methods may be called when the cursor is on the insert row.p blockquote  pNothing is said on what is supposed to happen then. codenextcode is less helpful by not even pointing that case outp  blockquote   pMoves the cursor froward sic one row from its current position. A codeResultSetcode cursor is initially positioned before the first row the first call to the method next makes the first row the current row the second call makes the second row the current row, and so on. p      pWhen a call to the next method returns codefalsecode, the cursor is positioned after the last row. Any invocation of a codeResultSetcode method which requires a current row will result in a codeSQLExceptioncode being thrown. If the result set type is codeTYPEFORWARDONLYcode, it is vendor specified whether their JDBC driver implementation will return codefalsecode or throw an codeSQLExceptioncode on a subsequent call to codenextcode. p      pIf an input stream is open for the current row, a call to the method codenextcode will implicitly close it. A codeResultSetcode objects warning chain is cleared when a new row is read.p      pstrongReturnsstrongbr   codetruecode if the new current row is valid codefalsecode if there are no more rows p      pstrongThrowsstrongbr   codeSQLExceptioncode  if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed result setp blockquote  pI have no prior experience with the JDBC APIs and therefore have no clue whether thats intentionally unspecified undefined behavior maybe or just an oversight.p  pCurrently I think Id just throw an codeSQLExceptioncode even though thats nowhere specified and thus maybe codeUnsupportedOperationExceptioncode would be better as codeSQLExceptioncode signals a DB error or a closed codeResultSetcode  neither of which would be the case here.p  pOr did I just miss a bit of documentation somewherep

Negative 6752 pThis could be a very basic question, but hopefully someone will be able to answer it.p  pI am receiving messages HL7 using a custom receive pipeline. Inside my custom pipeline, I am promoting properties into the context. I have set up a map where I need to access these properties. However, I would like to access these properties on the send side. The reason why it needs to be on the send side is because I am attaching my map to the send port, so I assume that the message will have already hit the MessageBox and will be mapped on the send side. Hopefully that makes sense...p  pI know that there are a few 3rd party tools I can use, but I was hoping that theres a simple functoid, or some code I can enter in a scripting functoid that will access the context for me.p  pWould someone be able to point me in the right direction with thisp

Negative 6752 pCurrently I am working on a Cclr application that is slowly making progress.  When I change a shared value in the GUI thread, its very easy for the main thread to see it has been changed as it would be running through a loop and checking for changes each time or every few, depending on how quickly it goes through the loop among other things.  p  pI run into the issue the other way around though.  When my main thread changes a shared and synchronized value, how do I notify my GUI that the value has been changed if there is no message loop I can see to insert a function into for checking  I have been looking into events but Im not very familiar with them and how thread safe they are, but it looks as though using them may be my only option.

Negative 6752 pIve been investigating this issue for hours and hours and I cannot come up with a decent solution or an explanation as to why this exception java.net.SocketException Socket closed is getting thrown. My last approach is now to ask you guys.p  pIve created a simple serverclient app for testing purposes the real application uses the same logic though, see below.p  pIf I repeatably invoke the same testcase for example through TestNGs eminvocationcountem annotation parameter or by using a simple forloop, at some point there will be a strongemjava.net.SocketException Socket closedemstrong.p  pThe test case below basically just starts the server opens the server socket, waits a couple of millis and then closes socket again. Closing the server socket involves opening a socket so that the server will return from the ServerSocket.accept method see Servershutdown.p  pI though it might be a multithreading issue with the code right after the ServerSocket.acceptline. So Ive surrounded it temporarily with a synchronizedblock  didnt help either.p  pDo you have any idea why this exception gets thrownp  pBest, Chrisp  pemstrongServer.javaemstrong looks like thisp  precodepackage multithreading import java.io.IOException import java.net.ServerSocket import java.net.Socket import org.apache.log4j.Logger  public class Server   private ServerSocket serverSocket private boolean isShuttingDown private final static Logger logger  Logger.getLoggerServer.class  public void start throws Exception      try          serverSocket  new ServerSocket5000         isShuttingDown  false      catch Exception e          throw new RuntimeExceptionStarting up the server failed  aborting, e           while true          try              Socket socket  serverSocket.accept              if isShuttingDown                  new Threadnew EchoRequestHandlersocket.start              else                  logger.infoServer is going to shutdown                 break                       catch IOException e              logger.errorError occured while waiting for new connections, stopping server, e             throw e                 public synchronized boolean isRunning      if serverSocket  null ampamp serverSocket.isBound ampamp serverSocket.isClosed ampamp isShuttingDown          return true          return false   public synchronized void shutdown throws IOException      if isRunning          isShuttingDown  true         if serverSocket  null ampamp serverSocket.isClosed              try                                     since the server socket is still waiting in its accept                   method, just closing the server socket would cause an                   exception to be thrown.

Negative 6752 pIm working on a prototype site and the client just wants to see how the nav will work. Im building an accordion with sprites and I need for the submenu items to not close the entire submenu when they are clicked. I have already applied some JQuery and Im happy with how its working so far... I would like to expand on that code. Right now the accordion has an active class on the first menu item to keep that menu item open on pageload. The other part of the Javascript is modifying existing classes to make it so the class keeps the menu item highlighted when clicked.

Negative 6752 pIs there a preimplemented linked list out there that would have been implemented using ids instead of array indexesp  pMOTIVATION what I want to accomplish here is a linked list from witch cells can be removed by multiple threads in parellel. The problem with javas LinkedList is that the references are index refs. p  pTo clarify lets say I have three threads and a LinkedList of three cells. Thread number one produces to cell number one or 0 but anyway..., ...and thread number three produces to cell number 3. so basically threads produce stuff to their cells that work as buffers. Now if thread number 2 removes cell number two for a business logical reason the reference of thread 3 changes to 2. Naturally this cant be done if thread 3 is still working on cell 3, so synchronization is needed and even if thread 3 isnt currently using its cell, the thread still needs to be told that its going to use cell 2 from now on.p  pThe solution if the linked list would have been implemented using ids instead of array index references the other threads would never see the changes, i.e. the cell number two could be safely removed since thread 3 would use its cell something like this linkedlist.addid 3, C cell instead of like this addint index, C cell.p  pI guess something like this is already implemented somewhere but after a while of googling, I couldnt find it.

Negative 6752 pI need to record the user voice in good quality many times. I can not use AudioRecordAudioTrack approach, because I got huge size files and it is not appropriate for me. 3gp format  nb encoder give me poor quality of recording.

I tried to use methods setAudioSamplingRate and setAudioEncodingBitrate, but they did not affect on record quality. I put different values for these method 16, 20, 16000, 40000, 44100, 96000 without any result. Maybe  this is device specific behavior  I use Samsung Galaxy Tab.

I also want to know if you think  it may make a difference but such a tiny one that I shouldnt worry about it.

Negative 6752 pI have a java program that accesses a database with columns codeID, FirstName, LastName, Agecode. ID is the primary key, no two elements in the database have the same ID.p  pIn part of my program, a codeServletcode displays all of the elements in the database in a HTML table, except it only displays the ID and codeFirstNamecodefields. I have set up the ID field to be a hyperlink. So far so good.p  pHowever, when the user clicks the ID hyperlink, I want this to forward them to a codeServletcode that displays codeID, FirstName, LastName, and Agecode of the particular element they clicked on. So, lets say this is the table the HTML displays p  ul liRow 1 code[ID1, FirstNameJim]code, andli liRow 2 code[ID2, FirstNameJoe]code.li ul  pThe actual data in the database is p  ul liRow 1 code[ID1, FirstNameJim, LastNameSmith, Age25]code, andli liRow 2 code[ID2, FirstNameJoe, LastNameChang, Age37]code.li ul  pIn the display table ID fields are hyperlinks for both Jim and Joe. This is all working so far.p  pHowever, when I actually click one, it doesnt do what I want. Say I clicked on the hyperlinked 2, in front of Joe. Then I would expect it to display 2, Joe, Chang, 37, from the database, but I dont know how to do this.p  pAll the hyperlink is doing is forwarding the request to a codeServletcode, whose URL pattern is codeDisplayPerson.docode, and attempting to get the ID parameter so it can get the element with that ID and display all of the other fields.p  pI know how to display all the fields IF I can get the ID parameter but I dont know how to set or send different ID parameters when each different hyperlinked ID is clicked, they all just forward to the same codeServletcode but this doesnt know which one the request was sent from.p  pI would also like to avoid URL appending if possible, but if thats the only way to do it then I could do that. Can someone explain how this can be done or even ifp

This meansp  ol liCD to the root of the projectli liSet back up any tabs  splits I had set, at their same locationsli liReopen the files I was working on last.li liIm going to explore Conque Shell today httpcode.google.compconque and if that works, I would want those shells to also reload and fire off their startup commands. CD to the project root, fire up the rails server, tail a log, etc.li ol  pSuggestions  Im looking to streamline my process so that I can just click a shortcut or run a command and after a few seconds be staring at my dev environment right where I left it last.p  pBonus I often use windows too, so being able to do the same in GVim would be great as well.p  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 6752 pI am trying to customize default TFS build process by adding a step where a database is deployed using the database project.

Negative 6752 pI just wrote my first servlet filter and am already ahving problems. What I wanted to do was to make the filter handle authentication so that if a protected page was being requested, the filter would cut in and redirect to a login page. If the login succeeded, the filter would then redirect the user to the original page requested.p  pTo give an example, one of the pages in question is a blog page. When a user clicks on Leave a comment, he is redirected by the filter to a login page if he hasnt logged in already. Up until here, the filter does its job. Then the user logs in and the usernamepassword is checked. If theyre ok, a session variable is set in the jsp and the page redirected to the comments page again. That request goes through the filter where I check the session variable. But no matter what, the session I get from the request seems to be a new one with no attributes set. Ive tried calling request.getSessionfalse and that seems to always return null. So not giving me the same session back that my jsp pages share.p  pIm using tomcat 7.0.2. I dont know if this is tomcat specific or that there is just some very obvious thing that Im missing.p  pHope you cna help me.p  pGislip  p Update p  pHere is my code. Guess that would be quite helpful .p  pBasically, I have a login page, a blog page and a comments page. On the blog page, I have this linkp  precodelta hrefpagebloggkomment.jspidltblog.getIDgtgt Leave comment ltagt codepre  pIn my filter, I have thisp  precodepublic void doFilterServletRequest req, ServletResponse res,         FilterChain chain throws IOException, ServletException       TODO Autogenerated method stub HttpServletRequest request  HttpServletRequest req HttpServletResponse response  HttpServletResponseres HttpSession session  request.getSessionfalse  Object userObj  null if session  null       userObj  session.getAttribute username   String contextPath  request.getContextPath String queryString  request.getQueryString String url  request.getRequestURI  String page  request.getParameterpage  String user  ltusergt if userObj  null      user  userObj.toString  if page  null      page  ltpagegt  if userObj  null ampamp page.indexOf bloggkomment.jsp   1       session.setAttribute destPage, page      response.sendRedirect index.jsppageblogglogin.jsp    System.out.println , Time                       new Date.toString     page     user  chain.doFilterreq, res  codepre  pSo far, so good. This does redirect me to the login page. There, I do thisp  precode    String user  request.getParameter username      String pass  request.getParameter password       if blog.confirmUser user, pass          session.setAttribute username, user        Object destPageObj  session.getAttribute destPage        String destPage  xxx       if destPageObj  null            destPage  destPageObj.toString       response.sendRedirect index.jsppage  destPage         gt       User exists lt          else  gt     User does not exist lt      codepre  pThe string User exists is never supposed to be printed out, but it always appears and I get the login page back. p  pThis is what I dont understand. I set the session variable username so that when the next request hits the filter, that variable should contain a value. But it always seems to be empty. In fact, when I called getSessionfalse in the filter, I always got null back. Even though the session variable is supposed to always exist in the JSP if it hasnt expried. p  pI have tried passing session variables between pages and that works perfectly. But to set a session variable in a page and read it back in the next redirect always fails.p  pI feel like theres something terribly obvious thats staring me in the face and Ive just worked too long on this to see itp  pHope you guys can helpp  p Further update p  pToo little space to write as a comment . What I want to do is this. I wanted to make my jsp pages independent of the login page. I.e. I wanted the filter to act as intermediary. So that when I send a user to my comments page, I dont need to worry about if hes logged in or not. If hes not logged in, the filter should redirect him to a login page and then send him on to the original destination. My blog is not the only thing that will require authentication and I wanted to have this logic all in the same place.p  pI dont want to pass the usernamepassword, as request parameters for security reasons. I want both to remain as session attributes. p  pI dont understand what you mean when you say that what Im doing in the login page should be done in the filter. I need a page to ask the user for his username and password and I dont want to send those along with the request. I saw an example here, a hrefhttpprideafrica.blogspot.com200704simpleauthenticationservletfilter.html relnofollowlinka which is exactly what I want to do. Except that this doesnt work for some reason because I cant seem to be able to access the same session where I stored the username.p  pIf Ive totally got it wrong, could you point me to a web page where this is done properly Ive spent hours googling and all I have found are examples that seem to work for everyone but me .p

This means that when I try to destroy and recreate the database for the next test, the drop database fails Active connection.p  precodeselect spid, status, loginame, hostname, blocked, dbnamedbid, cmd from master..sysprocesses where dbnamedbid  TESTDATABASE  54  sleeping IIS APPPOOLASP.NET v4.0   PETE    0   TESTDATABASE   AWAITING COMMAND codepre  pIm assuming this is some kind of connection pooling that IIS and SQL Server handle to reduce the overhead of all the opening and closing of connections from web requests I guess I wouldnt want to mess with this in the context of deploying a webservicep  pHowever, for the tests, I would like to kill off this connection so I can rebuild my database.p  pWhat is the best way to handle this Is this something I need to set in IIS, or in the test db Can I define it in the connection string so it happens on test onlyp  h2For infoh2  pSolved by adding the following code to the test teardown methodp  precode            if data.DatabaseExists                      data.ExecuteCommandALTER DATABASE TESTDATABASE SET SINGLEUSER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE             data.ExecuteCommandALTER DATABASE TESTDATABASE SET MULTIUSER             data.DeleteDatabase                           codepre  h2Updateh2  pI found that I can bypass this issue by adding Poolingfalse to the connection string in the Unit Test App.Config. This seems to work much better than force closing the connections because when you force close them sometimes the db isnt avaliable for the next test int he suite you get a no serice on the other end of the pipe type error because SQL has gone away but .net thinks its still there.p

Negative 6752 pIm really a newbie with javascript and Im having trouble developing code that will allow my website to automatically update certain weather values that are provided by another website as a text file on a daily basis. I know that there are many ways to read a text file from another url, but Im only interested in the values in the last line of the text file, particularly. The text file gets longer by 1 line each day as a new set of data is added. Each line in the text file always contains 16 pieces of data separated by spaces as shown below. p  p2012 03 08  140     86     1330      0    999   B6.5   6  0  0  4  0  0  0 2012 03 09  146     96     1240      1    999   B8.8  10  1  0  1  0  0  0 2012 03 10  149     89     1120      0    999   B7.0   9  1  0  4  0  0  0 2012 03 11  131    103     1260      2    999   B5.6   4  0  0  1  0  0  0 2012 03 12  115     89      650      0    999   B4.7   4  0  0  2  0  0  0p  pWhat Im interested in ultimately doing is outputting the fourth data element in this case, 89, on to my webpage.   p  pAs I see it, I have three problems to solve 1 access the text file at the other webwsite, 2 Read the last line of the file into a string variable, 3 Place the fourth data element of the last line into a string variable and output it to the webpage.p  pCan someone show me a relatively quick way to do thisp

Negative 6752 pWhen I need to build some third party library to be used in several of my projects under different version of MSVC, I usually build it for emeveryem MSVC version and for embothem Debug and Release configurations. Thats what boost does, and thats what we have been done for our whole life in my team.p  pHowever, I still dont get, why couldnt I just build this library with like... whatever. All I need is function prototype and object code, right Since Im linking CRT statically, I have no external dependencies. But when Im trying to link library built in Release under MSVC8 with my project in Debug under MSVC10 I have this annoying already defined linker errors which we all hate so much.p  pBut why Can I just encapsulate all this functions inside lib and do not export them so that my project will take only what it needs from the lib Why can I have precompiled version of libpng and zlib which I can link in every project Yes, they are not build using MSVC, I guess, but the still uses the same functions of CRT. So can anyone please explain in depth or share a link to some enlightened explanation of this issuep

Negative 6752 pI think Im doing it wrong. I am creating threads that are suppose to crunch some data from a shared queue.  My problem is the program is slow and a memory hog, I suspect that the queue may not be as shared as I hoped it would be.  I suspect this because in my code I added a line that displayed the size of the queue and if I launch 2 threads then I get two outputs with completely different numbers and seem to increment on their ownI thought it could be the same number but maybe it was jumping from 100 to 2 and so on but after watching it shows 105 and 5 and goes at a different rate. If I have 4 threads then I see 4 different numbers.p  pHeres snippet of the relevant parts. I create a static class with the data I want in the queue at the top of the programp  precodestatic class queueclass          int number         int[] data         Contextint number,  int[] data              this.number  number             this.data  data               codepre  pThen I create the queue after sending some jobs to the callable..p  precodestatic class processthreaded implements CallableltVoidgt       queue with contexts to process     private Queueltqueueclassgt queue      processthreadedqueueclass request          queue  new ArrayDequeltqueueclassgt         queue.addrequest           public Void call          whilequeue.isEmpty              System.out.printlnin contexts queue with a size of   queue.size             Context current  contexts.poll             get work and process it, if it work great then the solution goes elsewhere             otherwise, depending on the data, its either discarded or parts of it is added back to queue             queue.addnew queueclassk, datalist  codepre  pAs you can see, theres 3 options for the data, get sent off if data is good, discard if its totally horrible or sent back to the queue.  I think the queues are going when its getting sent back but I suspect because each thread is working on its own queue and not a shared one.p  pIs this guess correct and am I doing this wrong p

However, there was only one real source conflictthe changes have very little overlapso I thought things were going OK.p  pUnfortunately, all the fairly major changes Ive been making in the branched code are now, apparently, not under version control.

I am using Tortoise and Eclipse under Windows.p  pI did try one idea, which was to create one of the unversioned folders in a secondary copy of the repo using Tortoise this led to a different conflict when I tried to do an update, where it said the unversioned folder clashed with the versioned one.p  pLast time I merged something, ten years ago, it was not this painful, though admittedly we did it through a command line.

Negative 6752 pI have a mouseover event which triggers a tooltip I would like this tooltip to go away when the mouse is removed. onmouseout works well, emexceptem when the element goes away.p  pHere is a distilled example which uses background changes instead of tooltips so you can easily run itp  precodeltdiv idbargt   ltdiv onmouseoverdocument.bgColorgray onmouseoutdocument.bgColorwhite styleborder1px solid blackgt    ltspan onclickdocument.getElementByIdbar.innerHTML  gtRemove meltspangt   ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pThe problem is this when I click Remove me, my mouse is no longer over the div, but the onmouseout doesnt trigger, because it has gone away. What I would like is for this example to revert to a white background when I click Remove me.p  pThere is an obvious solution, which I would like to avoid. I do not want the onclick handler which removes the element to manually fix up the document. This is because there may be arbitrarily many handlers which could remove the div with the onmouseout. In general, all of the mouseout and removal handlers may be generated dynamically, and need to know about each other. To complicate things further, I might have a case where removable elements are nested in each other, and any of them could be removed. I might be able to remove this constraint, but it will take a little work.p  hr  pHere is an example of a solution that could work on mouseover, register the modal dialogue as active then whenever elements are removed, iterate over all modal dialogues and look for ones which are no longer in the document. But this requires me to keep a global store of dialogues, and takes time Onm, where n is the number of active dialogues, and m is how deeply nested the dialogue is in the DOM. Furthermore, I need to run this operation whenever I remove elements, even if its pretty obvious nothing is affected.p  pHere is another solution that could work if you can implement an onremovedfromdocument event, then we just copy the onmouseout handler to be the onremovedfromdocument event, and the example will work correctly too. I hear jQuery might support this, but I need to interoperate with nonjQuery code.p  pHere is yet another possible solution have each modal dialogue repeatedly poll to see if its parent is in the document. When it is not, have it commit seppuku. But polling is really ugly. I guess Id be willing to do this if theres nothing betterp  pHeres another idea use event capture to allow the onmouseout element to capture the click element first, and setup a timer to check if it is still in the document after the click is done.p  hr  pFor reference, here is what Im really trying to do I have a JS widget which builds a complicated tree structure. Many of the edits to the widget involve clicking some button in the tree, which then adds or deletes from the tree possibly deleting itself. However, some of the nodes need more complicated edit procedures, so I would like to bring up a tooltip with instructions and possibly more buttons when the user mouses over them, or even keep the dialogue around if the user clicks them. But the user may change his mind and decide to delete the node, or any parent of the node, in which case the dialogue should go away.  You can view an implementation of what I currently have a hrefhttplogitext.ezyang.scripts.mit.edulogitext.fcgiproving.28forallx.2CP.28x.29.29.7C.2D.28existsx.2CP.28x.29.29 relnofollowherea, where the dialogues are being manually created. I would like to start using a nice tooltip library, but all of them have the bug which I described above.p

I have simply been trying to get something communicating in a bidirectional manner.p  pThere are a few components. A standalone server which the java debug in Eclipse connects to. This server is configured to know where its heading based on the port connected to. So if port 1166 is hit, it knows to connect to a servlet on machine x.p  pi.e. Eclipse Debugger  Debug Proxy Server  Application Servlet  Application JVMp  pSo far for my efforts, I appear to be able to connect, but the streams are not fully functional. Eclipse sends a JDWPHandshake to the JVM, which is supposed to reply with JDWPHandshake back. Im finding that when JDWPHandshake is sent by Eclipse, it is written to the Debug Proxy Server and then relayed onto the Servlet, but it appears this is then being ignored in the servlet. The logs I am receiving are the followingp  precode[INFO] Started Jetty Server 20120618 100053,356  INFO ProxySocket   Connection received, forwarding to tidevwls031166 via httplocalhost8080tunneldebugproxy 20120618 100053,361  INFO ProxySocket   Connected to httplocalhost8080tunneldebugproxy 20120618 100053,603  INFO ProxyServlet   Received incoming http connection, attempting to forward to endpoint tidevwls031166 20120618 100053,604  INFO ProxyServlet   Connecting to endpoint tidevwls031166 20120618 100053,613  INFO StreamProxy   [endpointread gt httpwrite    ] beginning proxy transport. 20120618 100053,613  INFO StreamProxy   [httpread     gt endpointwrite] beginning proxy transport. 20120618 100053,619  INFO ProxySocket   Response Header HTTP1.1 200 OK 20120618 100053,619  INFO ProxySocket   Response Header ContentLength 0 20120618 100053,623  INFO ProxySocket   Response Header Server Jetty6.1.22 20120618 100053,624  INFO StreamProxy   [clientread  gt servletwrite  ] beginning proxy transport. 20120618 100053,624  INFO StreamProxy   [clientread  gt servletwrite  ] J 20120618 100053,624  INFO StreamProxy   [servletread gt clientwrite   ] beginning proxy transport. 20120618 100053,624  INFO StreamProxy   [clientread  gt servletwrite  ] D 20120618 100053,624  INFO StreamProxy   [clientread  gt servletwrite  ] W 20120618 100053,624  INFO StreamProxy   [clientread  gt servletwrite  ] P 20120618 100053,624  INFO StreamProxy   [clientread  gt servletwrite  ]  20120618 100053,624  INFO StreamProxy   [clientread  gt servletwrite  ] H 20120618 100053,624  INFO StreamProxy   [clientread  gt servletwrite  ] a 20120618 100053,624  INFO StreamProxy   [clientread  gt servletwrite  ] n 20120618 100053,624  INFO StreamProxy   [clientread  gt servletwrite  ] d 20120618 100053,624  INFO StreamProxy   [clientread  gt servletwrite  ] s 20120618 100053,624  INFO StreamProxy   [clientread  gt servletwrite  ] h 20120618 100053,624  INFO StreamProxy   [clientread  gt servletwrite  ] a 20120618 100053,625  INFO StreamProxy   [clientread  gt servletwrite  ] k 20120618 100053,625  INFO StreamProxy   [clientread  gt servletwrite  ] e codepre  pIm wondering if I need to change my thinking on this so that the streams are broken up into multiple requests and a session based connection is used. One request would become a never ending downstream i.e. infinite response, then when the client sends to the servlet, it would create a new request each time. Is this the key to getting this workingp  pBelow is the code for the Debug Proxy Server that can either run standalone or I have temporarily configured it to run as a servlet on a Jetty server for quick testing turn around time.

Negative 6752 pThe Android browser, since 2.2, supports fixed positioning, at least under certain circumstances such as when scaling is turned off.

Negative 6752 pCan you tell me where we should use modules and where classes I mean what is the usability and applicability principle for modules in Rubyp
Negative 6752 pI was looking through the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavautilLinkedList.htmlmethodsummary relnofollowLinkedList APIa for Java 7 and noticed something curious.  there does not appear to be a remove before or after type of method.  For example, If I have a 100 element LinkedList, and I want to remove the first 20 elements, Java seems to force you to remove them one at a time, rather than moving the start pointer to the 21st element and deleting the link between 20 and 21.  It seems like this is an operation that can be done in O1 time, instead of On time as Java seems to force you to do it.p  pAm I missing something here, or is it just a glaring hole in Javap  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI am aware of the codesublistint, intcode method in the List interface.  I still think that this will be slightly less efficient than the generic chop off the first or last n use case.p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pTouche to everyone who pointed out that finding the nth element is not O1.  Regardless of the ease of chopping off the first n1 elements, it still takes On time to find the nth.p  pHowever, as Dilum Ranatunga points out, there is the possibility that an iterator already exists at the given position.  In this case, it would still be useful to say I am here, remove all before me.p

Now, I transform the code a little, so that, it runs in Android. However, the logic underneath is the same. Here also, when a new client connects, a new thread is created. The Youtube APP is still the client. So now, the YouTube APP would request a proxy server residing in the same Android machine. As before, ProxyDroid is configured so that, YouTube APP knows where my Proxy server is running.br The code for Android looks like This code is modified accordingly after I got the first answer and it is not complete, because before completing the code has started showing serious errorsp  precodepublic class ChallengeAndroidProxyActivity extends Activity       public static final int SERVERPORT  4453     public static int threadName  0      Called when the activity is first created.

Negative 6752 pI have been looking over a couple of classes I have in an android project, and I realized that I have been mixing logic with data. Having realized how bad this can be to the readability and the testability of my project, I decided to do some refactoring in order to abstract away all services logic to separate services modules. However, since I have been relying on Javas polymorphism, I got lost and need some guidance. p  pSuppose I have this tobechanged layout for a super data class, and two subclassesp  precodepublic class DataItem       some variables        public saveToDB Some Arguments            do some stuff            public render           render the class         public class ChildDataItemA extends DataItem      Override     public saveToDB Some Arguments           super.saveToDB           more specific logic to ChildDataItemA            Override     public render           render logic for ChildDataItemA         public class ChildDataItemB extends DataItem      Override     public saveToDB Some Arguments           super.saveToDB           more specific logic to ChildDataItemB            Override     public render           render logic for ChildDataItemB        codepre  pNow, I thought about moving the codesaveToDBcode and coderendercode methods to a service class. However, sometimes I need to be able to call these method into instance of compiled type codeDataItemcode without knowing its runtime type. For instance, I might want to make the following callp  precodeListltDataItemgt dataList  for DataItem item dataList      item.saveToDB     item.render  codepre  pAdditionally, I thought of doing the followingp  precodepublic class ChildDataItemB extends DataItem      Override     public saveToDB Some Arguments           super.saveToDB           more specific logic to ChildDataItemB           Service.saveToDBB           Override     public render           render logic for ChildDataItemB          Service.renderB       codepre  pWhere I still keep dummy methods in each subclass that would call an appropriate service method. However, I do not think that this really achieves the separation I want since data classes will still know about services bad. p  pAny ideas on how to solve thisp  pEdit Note that coderendercode and codesaveToDBcode are just generic examples of what these methods can be, so the problem is not really about choosing an ORM or SQL related techniques.p

Negative 6752 pOk, I will attempt to explain what I am trying to do as best as I can. p  pUsing Webkitoverflowscrolling I am creating a list that has stackable headers, much like the effect that iPhones contact app gives. E.g. A stays to the top until B moves it out of the way etc. This is relatively easy to do on desktop or while the user is still scrolling.p  pHowever once the user flicks the scroller, it scrolls by itself with a slow deceleration, no events are fired during this period, until the scroller comes to a complete stop, by then its too late.p  pAfter much research I see that the flick deceleration duration is always the same about 2.4 seconds, just the end position changes. I can also see that many people get around this by creating their own library to mimic the iOS behaviour, which may be my only option. p  pI am attempting to work out the scroll top of the element using, as it scrolls by itself, by getting p  ul liTouch start positionli liTouch end positionli liThe time difference between these two gesturesli ul  pThis should allow me to keep track of the position and the end result before it has happened. However I am a bit stuck on how to use this information correctly to get the desired result. Any information or pointers would be extremely helpful. p  hr  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAfter getting stuck with physics I asked on a hrefhttpphysics.stackexchange.comPhysics stackexchangea and received this a hrefhttpphysics.stackexchange.comquestions33323endpositionofmovementfactoringindecelerationanswerap  pTherefore I believe this code should work.

Therefore I must not be giving the formula that correct information. p  pNot sure if its the position I am picking up or how i am executing the formula.p  hr  pstrongEDIT 3strongp  pI think that the scroller velocity does reduce at a factor of 0.95 every 325ms. I have found this information from this useful a hrefhttpariya.ofilabs.com201110flicklistwithitsmomentumscrollinganddeceleration.html relnofollowarticlea.p  blockquote   pThis observation led me to believe that the momentum scrolling is a sort of exponential decay. It is characterized by the speed of the decay. There are two different ways to express it halflife remember radioactive decay or time constant. For the latter, it is very much related to the step response of a first order system. In other words, the deceleration system is just an overdamped springmass system. Turns out, everything is still based on physics.p blockquote  precodeamplitude  initialVelocity  scaleFactor step  0  ticker  setIntervalfunction      var delta  amplitude  timeConstant     position  delta     amplitude  delta     step  1     if step gt 6  timeConstant          clearIntervalticker      , updateInterval codepre  blockquote   pIn fact, this is how the deceleration is implemented in Apples own PastryKit library and now part of iAd. It reduces the scrolling speed by a factor of 0.95 for each animation tick 16.7 msec, targeting 60 fps. This corresponds to a time constant of 325 msec. If you are a math geek, then obviously you realize that the exponential nature of the scroll velocity will yield the exponential decay in the position.

Negative 6752 pI needed to delete rows from a JTable on the delete keypress. So the use case is quite simple, the user select some rows, press the delete key, the rows get deleted. The code is also very simple p  precodeDefaultTableModel tableModel  DefaultTableModel table.getModel     int[] selectedRows  table.getSelectedRows     for int i  selectedRows.length  1 i gt 1 i          tableModel.removeRowselectedRows[i]      codepre  pThe problem is that after the deletion gets finished well hear a sound beep Im on windows, typical windows beep, as when pressing the delete key in an empty text box or when the caret is at the end of the text. What I thing is happening is that the key press is dispatched further to the text component that displays the text content of the cellthe first cell after the deleted ones. The beep is fired by the DefaultEditorKitDeleteNextCharActionactionPerformed method because there is no character ahead the dot. As a hack I modify the event in the listener p  precodee.setKeyCodeKeyEvent.VKSHIFT  see JTableprocessKeyBinding codepre  pthe event does not get forwarded further, so the beep dissapear but I think its a bad solution and theres a better one. But which is that better solution p

Negative 6752 pI need a wordpress loop that for every post checks a meta numeric variable previously assigned to each of the taxonomies of the post and returns the sum of these meta variables. To do so, I think I need a dynamic variable name for the total. I mean something likep  pvariablerelatedtopost  metataxonomy1  metataxonomy2  ...  metataxonomynbr echo variablerelatedtopostp  pHow can I do that Is it possible to generate a dynamic numeric variable via loop and HOW can I refer to it in a general way, without adressing it with its namebr Thanks everyone And sorry for possible English mistakes Pp  pEDIT I just realized the code by Alex is not what I wanted. I need a variable which changes name at every post and which value is always  0. Is there a solutionp

They do all of the DOM modifications with jQuery. Instead of completely refactoring most of this working and dependable code, Id like to be able to simply port it to python enabling simple and effective automation.p

That means different binary packages must be used with different operating systems unlike most Java programs.p  pAs we dont know much about which platforms used by Google, Its unlikely to use Xuggle. p  pSo, can you please tell me some other solutions  p  pThanks.p

Negative 6752 pI am wondering if there is a way that the Dropbox API can be utilized to grant access rights globally for an app.p  pHere is my scenario.  I am developing a Java application that will allow a teacher to have his students submit assignments.  The application will perform a plethora of tasks, but then it will upload the file to the teachers Dropbox account.p  pI have been able to get the application to authenticate and upload to each specific users DropboxAppsLabTab folder, but is there a way that I can make it so that the application always connects to the teachers dropbox and uploads to his DropboxAppsLabTab folderp  pI guess an easier way of stating it is to say that I want a way for a user to grant global access to unauthenticated requests from my single application.p

Negative 6752 pI have an application in which I have to scroll up in case of the keyboard showing. to get the keyboard size, Im registering the strongUIKeyboardWillShowNotificationstrong event like sop  precode   [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter]      addObserverself      selectorselectorkeyboardWillShow      nameUIKeyboardWillShowNotification      objectself.view.window] codepre  pThis does work, the problem is, it is being called after the strongtextFieldDidBeginEditingstrong was called. So, I cant get the actual keyboard size, but only after the field is already in edit mode, which defeats the whole purpose of registering this event on the first place. Im sure Ive called the strongUIKeyboardWillShowNotificationstrong and not the strongUIKeyboardDidShowNotificationstrong, although switching these two yield the same results first call was made to the delegate method and only then to the notification method. Any idea on how to turn this around Currently Im hard coding the size, which is very bad practice...p

Negative 6752 pI understand that Google Cloud SQL can be access through JDBC externally, thats nice, but I have been using various SQL GUI clients to view and manage mostly MySQL databases.  Tools like Navicat, Sequel Pro, etc. are familiar to me.

Also searched for ODBCJDBC bridges, but most are expensive tools.  p  pAny suggestion  I just want to develop apps with Django and relational db, and not to deal with all these complexities.

Negative 6752 pIm writing a little game using OpenGL in Java through JOGL, but I hardly think that matters, and I have lately been getting quite some error reports of people getting OpenGL errors 1285, which seem to indicate out of memory. I catch this when checking codeglGetErrorcode after having created new textures, which lends me the feeling that Im running out of texture memory.p  pHowever, this surprises me a bit. Isnt OpenGL supposed to manage texture memory for me, swapping textures between the GPU and process memory as necessary The specifications for codeglTexImage2Dcode, for sure, does not include any out of memory error as any of the possible error conditions.p  pIs this generally accepted practice for OpenGL drivers in spite of the specifications Are only some drivers doing this in spite of the specifications Do I need to take care to delete textures that havent been used for a while if I catch this error after codeglTexImage2Dcode Or am I perhaps seeing something completely else here that OpenGLs error reporting doesnt quite concisely convey to mep  pEdit For further information, I cannot, unfortunately, debug the problem myself, because Im not getting it. Reading from the reports people send me, the vast majority of those afflicted by this appear to be using Intel cards, but Ive spotted a few nVidia cards as well even a 680.p

Negative 6752 pI have a view containing a containerView gray, which contains a UILabel blue.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comupIai.png altenter image description herep  pI have layout constraints such that the containerView is always 8 pixels larger than the label on each side, and the containerViews borders lefttopright are fixed. The container view stretches appropriately when the device orientation changes.p  pThe labels numberOfLines property is set to 0. I am setting the labels text in code. The labels height grows to accommodate the text, as expected.p  pHeres the problem When I rotate the device to landscape, the labels width grows to fit into the screens available width, and the text will fit on 2 lines. But the UILabel does not shrink its height to fit snugly around the text. Notice the extra space above and below the text in the label.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJKdHQ.png altenter image description herep  pSo how can I make the labels height shrink with the device is rotated to fit snugly around the textp  pI have tried calling code[myLabel sizeToFit]code in the codeviewWillDidLayoutSubviewscode method, but this had no visible effect.p
Negative 6752 pBasically, I want to have an interface for converting Objects tofrom their XML or JSON String representation, something likep  precodepublic interface IStringifier      Converts the Object to its String representation, e.g. XML or JSON     public String toStringObject o      Converts from the String representation e.g. XML or JSON to an Object     public Object fromStringString s, Classltgt clazz  codepre  pSuch an interface would be fairly simple to implement in GSON, XStream etc. but by abstracting it you are abstracted from knowing just what is going on underneath.  And you are decoupled from one of the many many XML or JSON libraries, so clients are freer to pick their favorite.p  pIs there any standard Java interface for this  Something in Guava, Apache, etcp  hr  padded  None of the answers were what I really wanted yes, in javax.obscure.interfaces theres what you want but thanks for the replies.

Negative 6752 pIm using pbkdf2 in node.js for hashing passwords. p  pMy problem is that Im responding to a request for authentication and Im in the middle of authenticating if the passed credentials are correct. Im presuming that pbkdf2 is async as it could potentially take a large amount of time dependant on the size of the iterations. However moving the remaining authentication logic into a separate method to utilise the callback seems a tad ugly.p  pIs there a better approach than either using a timer or throwing all the consecutive authentication logic into a separate function  I know most will say that I should use the callback, but in my use case this just doesnt make sense. I cannot continue authentication until I have applied pbkdf2 to the passed password.p

Negative 6752 pOk so here is my situation. Im a PHP developer recently turned Rails developer. In PHP code the use of abstract classes as base classes is a pretty common pattern. When moving onto my current Rails application I did a lot of the preplanning with PHP ideas in my head which are now giving me a bit of a headache. p  pI have many different types of Invoices. In PHP I would create an abstract class and have my different types of Invoices that extend that class. I would DRY things up by keeping duplicate code in the abstract class and life is good. In rails things work a bit differently. p  pI cant seem to find a pattern that fits perfectly to my preconceptions. STI is nice but I HATE the idea of all the Null fields since each invoice will have many different fields. I have come close with Polymorphic associations using a module to DRY up my code. However, everywhere I look polymorphic associations are used differently then the way I intend. For example, in the railscast there are three different classes that each need to use comments. Its not exactly the same thing. p  pSo here is my question I already know how to use a module to DRY up my code, but how can I use polymorphic associations to provide similar modularity to my code as the base classes do in php FYI I cant use STI because there is no limit on how many different types of invoices could end up coming into existence. For now its 1, but in a month it could be 20. p

It works, but it isnt ideal. Im still open to other suggestions on this one.p  pIf an codeUpdatePanelcode doesnt work, Id still like to internally send the object to another file like an ashx file that could then send the file. Right now Im using the URL querystring to send enough information to rebuild the object in my ashx file. Needless to say, that isnt a very pretty solution.p

Negative 6752 pIm trying to figure out exactly how codeschemescode work in codexcodecode and what theyre for. I have a crossplatform product thats built on OS X using an external build system  codesconscode . Id like to be able to strongbuilddebugstrong it from codeXcodecode, mostly because of the symbol search and the debugger. Ive been using codeeclipse CDTcode which mostly works well, but has some quirks.p  pI can mostly get this to work by creating an empty project and adding an strongexternal build systemstrong target. Then, as part of the strongInfostrong of the target, I specify the strongBuild Toolstrong as strongusrlocalbinsconsstrong, and the strongArgumentsstrong are the build parameters that I send to scons. Basically I have the following build variables called codeTARGETcode and codeBUILDTYPEcode that vary according to whether the build is debug or release, so those can be specified as conditional strongBuild Settingsstrong. p  pThe problem is Id like codeMenugtProjectgtCleancode to work. It looks like codeXcodexcodebuildercode use the codeACTIONcode variable to pass this on  where codeACTTIONcode is either strongbuildstrong, strongcleanstrong, or some other build actions. See a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationDeveloperToolsReferenceXcodeBuildSettingRef1BuildSettingReferencebuildsettingref.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40003931CH3SW45 relnofollowxcodebuild ACTIONa. Scons is a bit different  it has a builtin clean action thats invoked on the command line with codescons ccode. So my first thought was to use a conditional strongBuild Settingstrong to pass this parameter, but it turns out that conditional strongBuild Settingsstrong dont seem to vary based on the build codeACTIONcode  just the build architecture and SDK. p  pIs it possible to add an expression to a strongBuild Settingstrong in codeXcodexcodebuildercode Is there another good way that I could get strongCleanstrong to work in codeXcodecode with sconsp

Negative 6752 pThe scopecontext of this question I am to develop a JavaJava EE based distributed serverside application that is scalable a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiScalabilityHorizontalandverticalscaling relnofollowscaleup,a rather than scaleout.p  pMy application comprises of servlets utilizing multiple instances of distributed backend services for processing client requests. If I need to achieve more throughput, I want to be able to strongjuststrong add more instances of these distributed services strongJVMs on the same or another machinestrong and expect to see an increase in throughput.p  pTo achieve this, I was thinking of a looselycoupled asynchronous system. I thought I would use Async Servlets servlet 3.0 and an applicationmanaged threadpool that places client requests on JMS queues, which would be picked by one of the distributed service instances and processed. The responses can be relayed back to the client using JMS, from the service instances to a responsethread in the servlet container.p  pHowever, an asynchronous system seems to be obviously more complex than a synchronous one ex errorhandling and errorrelaying to the client, request tracking etc. I am also worried about the future maintainability of the designcode.p  pSo, a question arises  strongDoes it make sense to do this synchronously, while still remaining distributed, scalable and looselycoupledstrong   If the answer is yes, then pls also share possible ways of achieving this while remaining constructive.p  pIf I can do this well in a synchronous way, then it will simplify the entire system.  I dont want to add complexity to the system unnecessarily.p  pAssuming it makes sense One possible implementation I could think of is using RMI. For ex A service registry for the distributed service instances to register and have a loadbalancer distribute the RMI calls across all the available instances. But it feels to be a oldgeneration solution. Are there any better options available p  pEdit  Other details about the scope of this question p  ul liThe clientside is browserbased does not demand an asynchronous serverside.  li liI dont need serverpush.li liAt any time, I wont have more outstanding requests than maxworkerthreads of the popular web servers even Apache.li liFor the above reasons, the usecases mentioned in a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2162783asynchronousservletsvssynchronousservletsrq1related questiona dont seem to apply to my scenario.li ul

Negative 6752 pI am modifying the CSS of an existing web page. The navigation menu is in the form of a list in which the items have a certain background color under normal circumstances and another color when active or hoveredover. The CSS code for this is as follows p  pre classlangcss prettyprintoverridecodenavigation li ahover, navigation liactive a      background 104E91  codepre  pSome of the menu items list items, in this case have dropdown menus with links to subpages. Im trying to make the navigation menu items have the active background color not only if they are themselves active, but also if one of their subpages is open.

Negative 6752 pTo prevent clickjacking from happenning for your website, I have noticed several different methods.

Negative 6752 pI would want to seriously begin multithreadedparallelconcurrent programming in emreal worldem. By that I mean like trying to solve emrealem problems in parallel and concurrently and not just learning about lowlevel details of codepthreadcode or codeMPIcode, locks, races and the like or academic, textbook examples. Regarding low level mechanism of parallel programming, in fact I would rather not know anything about them and just stick with something more like Actor model .p  pI have heard that some programming languages are inherently like what I am looking for and their paradigm  is to look at the problem at hand in a parallel concurrent, multithreaded, multiprocessed fashion and provide language level tools and constructs to implement the task in parallel e.g. Erlang has a concept of codeprocesscode as a language construct.p  pI fancy a language with a type system like that of Scala ... I know PHP very well and I used to do a lot of coding in CC. I have a working knowledge of Scala and Java and I can read Haskell but Im not particularity proficient at it. Im quite familiar with Functional paradigm and Im willing to learn much more. I am also interested in high level theoretical discussions about parallelismconcurrency.  p

Negative 6752 pI am trying to use a MPIAllgather kind of functionality among openmp threads. That is all the threads will collectively have a copy a databut each will generate only a part of it.p  pInfact by using the thread id in tag field of MPISEND and MPIRECV, communication between openmp threads is possible. But MPIAllgather does not seem to work that way.p  h2Exampleh2  pI have 2 MPI process. Each process has 2 openmp threads. Now each of these 4 threads computes part of data.

Negative 6752 pI was handed a new requirement and this one is new to me. After a day or two of research, Im still unable to figure this one out. The requirement is to find a way to send our Report page as an email. This report page has multiple gridviews and multiple SqlDataSources connected to it. This page is very heavy on the asp controls. This page does belong to a website that uses Forms authentication. I was able to make this page viewable to unauthenticated users. I recommended just sending the link to the page and everyone, even if they dont have a login, are able to see the page. This idea seemed to be over looked as they are now printing this page, scanning it in as a pdf, then emailing it. It seems like it is defeating the purpose. I have placed a Send as Email button inside the aspx page and one click Im trying to send this page as the body of the email. This is what I have tried so far..p  precodeprotected void btnEmailClickobject sender, EventArgs e                      using System.IO.StreamReader reader  System.IO.File.OpenTextServer.MapPathReportingReport.aspx                              string fromAddress  fromaddresssomething.com                 string toAddress  toaddresssomething.com                 System.Net.Mail.MailMessage sendMail  new System.Net.Mail.MailMessagefromAddress, toAddress                 sendMail.Subject  Testing                 sendMail.IsBodyHtml  true                 sendMail.Body  reader.ReadToEnd                  SmtpClient smtp  new SmtpClientmail.something.com                 smtp.SendsendMail                        codepre  pThis sends the email, but unfortunately, it only sends a single word which is Back and that is the link button that is in my aspx page.

Negative 6752 pIs it possible to generate individual INSERT statements for SQL Server records using just Management Studio or Visual Studiop  pYou can generate scripts to get the data for the entire table in SSMS, but not just a single row or filtered set of rows.p  pIn Visual Studio 2012, if you select the table data in SQL Server Object Explorer, you get a Script button, which generates insert statements for the grid results, which is either 200, 1000, or All records  but I cant find a WHERE filter, like there is in SSMS.p  pIs there any trick that Im missing Either SSMS or VS would be great  ideally Id be able to filter a specific row or set of rows, then generate INSERT statements specifically for these rows.p  pTheres SSMS Toolpack, RedGate, Toad, and Im sure a handful of other paid products that can do this, but Im hoping theres some builtin way.p  pThis question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions982568whatisthebestwaytoautogenerateinsertstatementsforasqlservertablehas been addressed beforea, but all I can find was prior to 2012, so maybe something has been introduced since then.p

Negative 6752 pIm writing a batch file to map multiple servers to drives on my PC. Using the NET USE command, I have managed to map the drives successfully.p  pWhen viewed in Windows Explorer, each drive shows the letter assignment and the server name. Id like to display a userfriendly plainEnglish name for each server in the Explorer view also this is different from the volume label. I can rightclick on each drive individually in Explorer and rename but this is a bit longwinded.p  pIs there any way that names can be assigned to the drives from the command prompt and therefore from a batch file rather than rightclicking and renaming in Explorerp

Negative 6752 pI am trying to set up global variables that would be accessible by any of the threads in Django. I know there are endless posts on stackoverflow about this, and everyone says dont do it. I am writing a web application which does some file processing using the a hrefhttpspypi.python.orgpypiacora relnofollowAcoraa Python module.  The Acora module builds a tree of sorts based on some input data strings. The process of building the tree takes some time, so Id like to build the Acora structure at application start up time, so that when files are submitted to be processed, the Acora structures would be ready to go. This would shave 30 seconds from each file to be processed if I could pull this off.p  pIve tried a few methods, but for each request, the data isnt available and I think its because each request is processed in a separate thread, so I need a cross thread or shared memory solution, or I have to find something other than Acora. Also, Acora cant be pickled or serialized as it is a C module and doesnt expose its data to Python. Ive tried Django cache and cPickle, without luck because they use Pickle.  Thoughtsp

Negative 6752 pNote This is NOT about dynamic ranges. Rather, it is about dynamically naming ranges based on the values of a dynamic range.p  pSo, what I want to do is to create ranges based on the names of a list. These ranges should then be used to filter the workbook on several sheets.p  pCurrently, I have a document with info about employees, skills, applications etc for an entire unit divided into 2 teams. To easily switch between the entire unit and each team I have filtered certain rows and columns in several worksheets, depending on what team each employee belongs to. This works well but it now occurred to me that it will be a nightmare to maintain this document if people quit, start, change roles etc. Therefore, what I want to do isp  pLoop through headers of rowcolumn depending on worksheet.p  pIf headername equals any name in defined name list, add rowcolumn to range Filter ... With this info, hideunhide all the named ranges with the click of a button, like thisp  precodeSub FilterUnit1 If RangeUnit1.EntireColumn.Hidden  True Then     RangeUnit1.EntireColumn.Hidden  False ElseIf RangeUnit1.EntireColumn.Hidden  False Then     RangeUnit1.EntireColumn.Hidden  True End If codepre  pWhere range unit1 are all the columns in different worksheets where the header belongs in the Unit1list where the people in each department are specified.p  pSo, if my list contains Peter, Sarah,James in sheet3, hide columns in sheet1 with headers Peter, Sarah, James. If Peter is removed from the list in sheet1, redefine range in sheet1 etc.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciatedp  pEDIT So I wrote a long description with images but it wont allow me to post it. How to get reputation as a beginner if you can neither ask nor reply to questions reallyp  pAnyway, based on three pictures where the first one is just the list with names and the other ones have column headers with the names in the list.p  pIn the first picture, I define what names belong to what unit. With this information, name the following rangesp  pColumns BD and rows 811 in sheet Experience as emUnit1Experienceem p  pRows 35 and possibly columns EI in sheet LearningGoals as emUnit1LearningGoalsem p  pSame procedure for names in unit2 list.p
Negative 6752 pWhile implementing a find or search method in a repository class, is is better to accept a domain model or is it better to implement specific find methodsp  pFor example we have a codePersoncode class with the attributes codenamecode, codeidcode.p  pIn the repository we could have a codefindcode method that accepts a person as a parameter. That method will use the given model to search for an existing person.p  pThe other approach is to implement a find method per attribute codefindbynamecode, codefindbyidcode.p  pSince I will be implementing this in Python I could also implement a method accepting keywords. This will resemble the acceptamodel approach codefindnameharrycodep  pAs a side question, when the find method concerns an indexed value codeidcode, is it better to use codegetbyidcode which implies indexes or codefindbyidcode which is more abstract.p

Negative 6752 pI am trying to use coderequirejscode in an Apple TV project. We have a lot of coderequirejscode modules written for web, would be cool if we could reuse them.p  pApple TV platform has certain limitations and its sorta impossible to use requirejs as is. Theres no DOM in common sense.  One possible way I found to overcome the problem is first to load require.js itself and then override its code.loadcode method, so whenever coderequirefoocode gets called it would load codefoo.jscode via a simple XHR callp  precode requirejs.load  context, moduleName, moduleUrl gt     reqModule  new XMLHttpRequest     reqModule.openGET, appRootmoduleUrl, true     reqModule.sendnull     reqModule.onreadystatechange  gt      if reqModule.readyState is 4 and reqModule.status is 200           fn  new FunctionreqModule.responseText  parse module                                        context[moduleName]  fn           context.completeLoadmoduleName codepre  pSo this works for normally defined modules like thisp  precode  define [], gt        someField empty field codepre  pEven works for self executing functions like this with shim configuredp  precode  myFoo  gt       someFieldempty field    codepre  pemfor example codeUndercore.jscode contains itself in a self executing wrapperemp  pHowever, that doesnt work with modules defined like thisp  precode myFoo  gt     someFieldempty field codepre  pQuestion how can I make it work for all 3 cases When used in browser, requirejs successfully loads all of them.p  pOne solution I found is to wrap the function in codedefinecode block for nonwrapped modules like in the last example, so instead of doing  codefn  new FunctionreqModule.responseTextcode I would dop  precodefn  define [], new Functionreturn reqModule.responseText codepre  pBut then that would break codeloadcode for both first and second cases. Is there a way to find out if a function wrapped in a selfexecuting block or not How can I distinguish first two cases from the last onep
Negative 6752 pI have the following method which takes the plain text and the key text.

But for example if it performs XOR on G amp M, which is 71 XOR 77 it returns 10. And 10 stands for emLine feedem. This is then actually not represented by a character in my output. This leads to a plain text of a length being encrypted to a cipher string which is only 2 characters long, in some cases. I suppose this would make a decryption impossible, even with a key Or are the ascii characters 0  31 there but simply not visiblep

Negative 6752 pDoes anyone know how to implement a word suggestion popup menu so that when you type letters it will open up popu menu and suggest words that you can choose from and when chosen you can continue typing much like the word suggestion in for example text messages.

Negative 6752 pThis is a question to try and resolve a UI caching issue with Knockout mentioned as an aside in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma12647270761388this answera.  p  pTake the below binding based on the previous answerp  precodeko.bindingHandlers.amountValue     init function element, valueAccessor, allBindingsAccessor      var underlyingObservable  valueAccessor      var interceptor  ko.computed       read function           return   underlyingObservable       ,        write function newValue          var current  underlyingObservable,             valueToWrite  Math.roundparseFloatnewValue.replace,   100  100          if valueToWrite  current             Clear the observables value to force a UI refresh           underlyingObservablenull                   underlyingObservablevalueToWrite                  ko.applyBindingsToNodeelement,  value interceptor      codepre  pThe write function strips the dollar sign, converts it from a string to a number, and rounds the amount to 2 decimal places, storing the result in the observable.p  pHowever, if the user is entering a value which, after parsingconversion, results in the same value as that currently stored in the underlying observable then there is a problem. Essentially, Knockout decides that as the value has not changed, therefore the UI need not change.  The UI and the underlying observable are out of sync. strongTHIS IS BAD.strongp  pExample current underlying Amount 1 value is 22.45. User enters 22.45111. On update the Amount 1 value is set as 22.45. However the onscreen field value is left as 22.45111. i.e. It is out of sync with the underlying Amount 1 value.p  pI have a workaround for this issue which is also implemented in the above bindingp  precode        if valueToWrite  current             Clear the observables value to force a UI refresh           underlyingObservablenull          codepre  pThis checks if the codevalueToWritecode to the observable is the same as that currently stored in the observable and, if it is, clears that value out by setting the observable to null.  Then it subsequently sets the observable back to that old  new value which in turn refreshes the UI.p  pThis works but it feels wrong.  Surely there must be a better way  Im assuming that Ive overlooked something but I dont know what.  p  pI dont believe that codevalueHasMutatedcode  codevalueWillMutatecode is the answer.  Is there a codeforceUIRefreshcode method hiding out in Knockout that I havent spottedp  pThis is illustrated in this a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netjohnnyreillykr78m relnofollowjsfiddleap

We will calculate based on sell through percentage.  For eg. I sent a 10pcs of Product A to store X. And the weekly report says that 6pcs of Product A sold in store x. So the sell through percentage is 60 and the stock in store X reduced to 4pcs of Product A. So from the warehouse I have to send 6 more pieces to store x immediately. This is for one store is okay.

Id like to avoid that extra dependency. The resulting executable stops responding on SDL initializations or some OpenGL calls unless Visual Studio launches the release build. So Ive got some kind of multithreading issue but Im not close to understanding it. Little help p  pUPDATE FORCEMULTIPLE allows the project to be compiled with MT. But just like with MD, the resulting executable crashes unless visual studio launches the release build. What does that meanp  pUPDATE2 Use MD in SDL projects. Crash was just a memory error the debugger wasnt catching. Linking was unrelated.p

Negative 6752 pI am supposed to store and keep track of a lots of counters multiple counters for each meter, there are multiple meters spitting readings. p  pIs it OK to use one HashMap for each type of counter, so that the key becomes the meter id and  value becomes the counter. In this case I will have as many HashMaps as type of counters. p  pOr shall I use something like a HashMap of a HashMap. p  pAnd is there any way I can simply use Arrays for such a use case. For that I would need to replacemap Array index to meterid.  Not sure if that is possible at all, but it will be much efficient if I am not wrong as HashMap uses Array itself so Array got to be faster. p

Negative 6752 pIm working on a side project using python and Django. Its a website that tracks the price of some product from some website, then show all the historical price of products.p  pSo, I have this class in Djangop  precodeclass Productmodels.Model   price  models.FloatField   date  models.DateTimeFieldautonow  True   name  models.CharField codepre  pThen, in my views.py, because I want to display products in a table, like sop  precode....  Name      Date 1  Date 2  Date 3 ...     .... ....  Product1  100.0   120.0   70.0    ...    .... .... ... codepre  pIm using the following class for renderingp  precodeclass ProductViewobjects   name     pricehistory   codepre  pSo that in my template, I can easily convert each productview object into one table row. Im also passing through context a sorted list of all available dates, for the purpose of constructing the head of the table, and getting the price of each product on that date.p  pThen I have logic in views that converts one or more products into this ProductView object. The logic looks something like thisp  precodedef conversion   resultdict     allproducts  Product.objects.all   for product in allproducts     if product.name in resultdict       resultdict[product.name].appendproduct     else       resultdict[product.name]  [product]    So resultdict will be like     Product1[product, product], Product2[product],...   productviews  []   for products in resultdict.values      Logic that converts list of Product into ProductView, which is simple.    Then Im returning the productviews, sorted based on the price on the     latest date, None if not available.   return sortedproductviews,                  key  lambda x getlatestpricelatestdate, x,                 reverse  True codepre  pAs per Daniel Roseman and zymud, adding getlatestpricep  precodedef getlatestpricedate, productview   if date in productview.pricehistory     return productview.pricehistory[date]   else     return None codepre  pI omitted the logic to get the latest date in conversion. I have a separate table that only records each date I run my pricecollecting script that adds new data to the table. So the logic of getting latest date is essentially get the date in OpenDate table with highest ID.p  pSo, the question is, when product grows to a huge amount, how do I paginate that productviews list e.g. if I want to see 10 products in my web application, how to tell Django to only get those rows out of DBp  pI cant or dont know how to use django.core.paginator.Paginator, because to create that 10 rows I want, Django needs to select all rows related to that 10 product names. But to figure out which 10 names to select, it first need to get all objects, then figure out which ones have the highest price on the latest date.p  pIt seems to me the only solution would be to add something between Django and DB, like a cache, to store that ProductView objects. but other than that, is there a way to directly paginate produvtviews listp

Negative 6752 pCurrently I have a table that has a usertype column and will only show the row if the user matches that usertype. I want to make it so there can be multiple usertypes set without duplicating the data and without creating another table. I thought that I could convert the column from an int to varchar and have it be a comma separated list of user type IDs.p  pSo far it has been working great. That is as long as I know what the usertype is beforehand because then I can specifically use that when checking if I should display to the userp  precodeSELECT  FROM perm WHERE usertype50     OR usertype LIKE 50,     OR usertype LIKE ,50,     OR usertype LIKE ,50 codepre  pThe issue comes when I am trying to join tables on the value. When I tried using codeINcodep  precodeSELECT p. FROM perm p JOIN [user] u ON u.type IN p.usertype codepre  pI get the error codeConversion failed when converting the varchar value 50,40,30 to data type int.code So I decided I would go back to the codeLIKEcode method which I have been using abovep  precodeSELECT p.

It only happens on binding expressions and only when using HTML entities on a string between some other code or not.p  pWhile I suspect to know why this happens, Im looking for a further explanation.

Negative 6752 p[Edit this is now solved, albeit with an outstanding query  see updates.]p  pIm developing a small WPF application  an alarm clock  and have a problem with representing my WeekDays enum as checkboxes in my Alarm Editor window.

When the Save routine gets to this bitp  precodebinding  this.cbSun.GetBindingExpressionCheckBox.IsCheckedProperty binding.UpdateSource codepre  pthe source is updated, whereupon the targets are updated. This means all user changes are lost apart from any change to the first target Sunday in my code.p  pWhat I would like is a combination of OneTime and OneWayToSource binding Targets should be initialised from the source, but are not subsequently updated from the source, and the source is updated from the targets upon save.

The value converter stuff is really neat, but Ive now had to implement the conversion logic in two places, once in the value converter, and once in my initialisation code.p  pI would have thought that the scenario here is pretty common an editor window where values need to be loaded from some collection, then messed around with by the user, and only committed back to the collection once the user clicks Save. But theres no binding mode that supports this and Ive had to hack around the lack of it. Im new to WPF so I may well be missing something  Id like to know if theres any better approach which makes use of the value converter in both directions.p  pOtherwise, hopefully this little tweak to PaulJs approach from the linked question at the beginning, which is necessary in the case where UpdateSourceTriggerExplicit, will be useful.p

Negative 6752 pIve been assigned to make a Black Jack game. I want it to be replayable by pressing a button when the round is over. Ive set it up so that I have a method named initGame that plays each player and the dealer a card each, and enables players[] buttons. It then runs runGame, which is supposed to check if a player is done playing over 21pressed stay.p  pWhen all players are deone it then sets running to false, enabling the resetbutton, which then runs initGame.

Negative 6752 pIm going to try my best to explain my problem using a scenariop  pI have ClassA which contains only one nonstatic instance of ClassB, many nonstatic methods that affect that instance of ClassB that we can call EFFECTS and one last nonstatic getter method that returns that instance of ClassB.p  pI have ClassC which contains a nonstatic array of instances of ClassB. In ClassC I have two nonstatic methods, one that gets a single instance of ClassB from the array and another that sets a single instance of ClassB by the given index value.p  pWhat Im trying to do I want to have a ClassD that you can create instances of and which acts like an List of EFFECTS, and ClassD would have a nonstatic method that takes in ClassC as a parameter.

Finally this method returns the ClassC with changed ClassB values in its array.p  pMy current solution but I dont know how to get it to work is create an Enum with method references as constants And then be able to store these in ClassD And somehow call them But Im not extremely familiar with enums, and Ive searched online for this but cant find out how to make this work.p  pExample of Scenariop  precodepublic class ClassA      ClassB classB     public ClassB get  return classB       public void effectA          affects classB instance           public void effectB          affects classB instance           public void effectC          affects classB instance        public class ClassB      Code for ClassB   public class ClassC      ClassB[] classBs      public ClassCint size          classBs  new ClassB[size]           public ClassB getBint index          return classBs[index]           public void setBint index, ClassB classB          classBs[index]  classB           public int getSize          return classBs.length        public class ClassD      ArrayListltEffectsgt effects      public ClassD          effects  new ArrayListltEffectsgt           public void addEffectEffects effect, int effectIntensity                     public void removeEffectint index          effects.removeindex           public ClassC applyEffectsClassC classC          for int i  0 i lt classC.getSize i              ClassB classB  classC.getBi             Apply all effects from effects ArrayList to classB             classC.setBi, classB                  return classC        public enum Effects       Code related to effect methods from ClassA  codepre  pWhere the question marks are thats where I dont know how to do this to achieve what Im trying to do.p

Negative 6752 pI have a ton of identical SKSpriteNodes added to my scene, all with the same zPosition, layered on top of each other according to the order they are added to the scene.  I need to be able to pick one SKSpriteNode, and add another at the same index plus or minus one.  I know I can use codescene.insertChildmySpriteNode, atIndexindexcode but how do I get that index from a SKNode or SKSpriteNode I have looked through the documentation, and online, there must be something I am missing, it seems like it would be so simple My ideal solution     codescene.insertChildmySpriteNode, atIndexsomeSpriteNode.siblingIndexcode  but I do not see a property on SKNode like siblingIndex, or maybe it would be called indexInParent.p  pI suppose I could keep count of every node I add to the scene, and subclass SKSpriteNode and set my own index, but I add nodes in a couple different places.  This would be tedious and easily broken if I try and change my code later.p  pMaybe I could iterate through the entire children array property on the scene until I found the node  the node I am searching for, but this is very expensive and inefficient.p  pAnd using the zPosition is not ideal because I am using zPosition for a few other layers in the app, and the amount of SKSpriteNodes that can be added is unlimited, so eventually I would break through to the next layer.p  pHopefully someone tells me I have simply overlooked this property somewhere Any help is appreciated thanksp

Ive played around with both codeusrbinexecsnoopcode and codeusrbinnewproc.dcode and stripped down versions, that just install a single probe codesyscallposixspawnreturncode and do nothing else e.g. no prints. p  pThese do great job getting me the info I need, strongbutstrong when I start an app that kicks off multiple processesquickly execs multiple commands e.g. VMWare Fusion  the probes seem to noticeably impact the system. Specifically codekerneltaskcode consistently spikes to 50 CPU usage for a few seconds and the OS UI mouse, etc noticeable slowslags...if the dtrace probes are not installed, this behavior is never observed.p  pSo a few questionsbr 1 any way to avoid this perf issue dtrace pragmasbr 2 are dtrace probes cumulative if I install dtrace probes do I need to manually uninstall them, or does ctlC cleardisable them br 3 any way to see what dtrace probes are currently installed p  pIm not attached to using dtrace  but am not aware of another nonpolling way to get the pidprocess name of things that are started on OS X p

Negative 6752 pHas anyone had any luck getting angularbootstrap modals working in angular1.3.xp  pMy modals work completely fine in angular1.2.x.  However when I upgrade to angular1.3.11 the modals dont appear.p  pWhen I click the button that opens the modal, the scrollbars dissapear like the modal is open.  When I highlight over where the modal would be, my mouse cursor changes like its over the modal I have draggable elements inside the modal.  If I click the modal, it appears normally.  p  pSimply put, the modal is there, its just invisible with angular1.3.11 until I click it.  After which, the modal functions completely normally.  p  pI would like to use angular1.3.x since theyve implemented the whole bindonce thing.p  pTo me it seems like its a styles related issue.  Im not sure why the difference in angular versions would cause this though.  If I revert back to 1.2.x, they display fine again.  p  pI know angularbootstrap doesnt support angular1.3.x yet, but considering the functionality still works, it seems like a small, doable fix.  I just cant figure out how to fix it.  Any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 6752 pi am trying to have apache in OSX to have override. With MAMP is properly working but with my apachectl dont work. So my .htaccess is proper. Ty for any help. Confs below. p  petcapache2httpd.confp  precode  This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the  configuration directives that give the server its instructions.  See ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4gt for detailed information.  In particular, see   ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4moddirectives.htmlgt  for a discussion of each configuration directive.   Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding  what they do.  Theyre here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure  consult the online docs. You have been warned.     Configuration and logfile names If the filenames you specify for many  of the servers control files begin with  or drive for Win32, the  server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do not begin  with , the value of ServerRoot is prepended  so logsaccesslog  with ServerRoot set to usrlocalapache2 will be interpreted by the  server as usrlocalapache2logsaccesslog, whereas logsaccesslog   will be interpreted as logsaccesslog.    ServerRoot The top of the directory tree under which the servers  configuration, error, and log files are kept.   Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point  ServerRoot at a nonlocal disk, be sure to specify a local disk on the  Mutex directive, if filebased mutexes are used.  If you wish to share the  same ServerRoot for multiple httpd daemons, you will need to change at  least PidFile.  ServerRoot usr    Mutex Allows you to set the mutex mechanism and mutex file directory  for individual mutexes, or change the global defaults   Uncomment and change the directory if mutexes are filebased and the default  mutex file directory is not on a local disk or is not appropriate for some  other reason.   Mutex defaultprivatevarrun    Listen Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses andor  ports, instead of the default. See also the ltVirtualHostgt  directive.   Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to   prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.  Listen 12.34.56.7880 Listen 80    Dynamic Shared Object DSO Support   To be able to use the functionality of a module which was built as a DSO you  have to place corresponding LoadModule lines at this location so the  directives contained in it are actually available before they are used.

UserGroup The name or number of the usergroup to run httpd as.  It is usually good practice to create a dedicated user and group for  running httpd, as with most system services.  User www Group www  ltIfModulegt   Main server configuration   The directives in this section set up the values used by the main  server, which responds to any requests that arent handled by a  ltVirtualHostgt definition.  These values also provide defaults for  any ltVirtualHostgt containers you may define later in the file.   All of these directives may appear inside ltVirtualHostgt containers,  in which case these default settings will be overridden for the  virtual host being defined.     ServerAdmin Your address, where problems with the server should be  emailed.  This address appears on some servergenerated pages, such  as error documents.  e.g. adminyourdomain.com  ServerAdmin youexample.com    ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.  This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify  it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.   If your host doesnt have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.  ServerName www.example.com80    Deny access to the entirety of your servers filesystem. You must  explicitly permit access to web content directories in other   ltDirectorygt blocks below.  ltDirectory gt     AllowOverride none     Require all denied ltDirectorygt    Note that from this point forward you must specifically allow  particular features to be enabled  so if somethings not working as  you might expect, make sure that you have specifically enabled it  below.

By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but  symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.

Options FollowSymLinks Multiviews     MultiviewsMatch Any            AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.

If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a ltVirtualHostgt  container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be  logged here.  If you do define an error logfile for a ltVirtualHostgt  container, that hosts errors will be logged there and not here.  ErrorLog privatevarlogapache2errorlog    LogLevel Control the number of messages logged to the errorlog.  Possible values include debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,  alert, emerg.

If you do not define any access logfiles within a ltVirtualHostgt      container, they will be logged here.  Contrariwise, if you do      define perltVirtualHostgt access logfiles, transactions will be      logged therein and not in this file.          CustomLog privatevarlogapache2accesslog common            If you prefer a logfile with access, agent, and referer information      Combined Logfile Format you can use the following directive.          CustomLog privatevarlogapache2accesslog combined ltIfModulegt  ltIfModule aliasmodulegt           Redirect Allows you to tell clients about documents that used to       exist in your servers namespace, but do not anymore. The client       will make a new request for the document at its new location.      Example      Redirect permanent foo httpwww.example.combar            Alias Maps web paths into filesystem paths and is used to      access content that does not live under the DocumentRoot.      Example      Alias webpath fullfilesystempath           If you include a trailing  on webpath then the server will      require it to be present in the URL.  You will also likely      need to provide a ltDirectorygt section to allow access to      the filesystem path.            ScriptAlias This controls which directories contain server scripts.       ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that      documents in the target directory are treated as applications and      run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to the      client.  The same rules about trailing  apply to ScriptAlias      directives as to Alias.          ScriptAliasMatch cgibiniwebobjects.

AddType applicationxgzip .tgz           AddEncoding allows you to have certain browsers uncompress      information on the fly. Note Not all browsers support this.          AddEncoding xcompress .Z     AddEncoding xgzip .gz .tgz           If the AddEncoding directives above are commentedout, then you      probably should define those extensions to indicate media types          AddType applicationxcompress .Z     AddType applicationxgzip .gz .tgz            AddHandler allows you to map certain file extensions to handlers      actions unrelated to filetype. These can be either built into the server      or added with the Action directive see below           To use CGI scripts outside of ScriptAliased directories      You will also need to add ExecCGI to the Options directive.          AddHandler cgiscript .cgi       For type maps negotiated resources     AddHandler typemap var            Filters allow you to process content before it is sent to the client.           To parse .shtml files for serverside includes SSI      You will also need to add Includes to the Options directive.          AddType texthtml .shtml     AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml ltIfModulegt    The modmimemagic module allows the server to use various hints from the  contents of the file itself to determine its type.

I feel like i am missing something obvious. p  pAlso , depending on how I exit out of the app , sometimes when I come back to it , when I click the button, the button itself gets focus , and any typing does not appear in the editText. p  precodeltRelativeLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     xmlnstoolshttpschemas.android.comtools     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent     toolscontextrelativePackage.activityClass gt      ltButton         androidididbutton1         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidlayoutcenterHorizontaltrue         androidlayoutmarginTop110dp         androidonClickshowKeyboard         androidtextButton gt      ltEditText         androididideditText1         androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent         androidlayoutheightwrapcontent         androidlayoutalignParentLefttrue         androidlayoutalignParentToptrue         androidlayoutmarginLeft37dp         androidems10           androidclickableFALSEgt          ltrequestFocus gt     ltEditTextgt  ltRelativeLayoutgt codepre  pJAVAp  precodepackage com.example.textfield      import android.app.Activity     import android.content.Context     import android.os.Bundle     import android.view.Menu     import android.view.MenuItem     import android.view.View     import android.view.inputmethod.EditorInfo     import android.view.inputmethod.InputMethodManager     import android.widget.Button     import android.widget.TextView      public class MainActivity extends Activity       Button btn     TextView txt      Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.activitymain          btn  Button findViewByIdR.id.button1         txt  TextView findViewByIdR.id.editText1         txt.setFocusablefalse         txt.setClickablefalse         txt.setImeOptionsEditorInfo.IMEACTIONDONE             public void showKeyboardView v           txt.setFocusabletrue         txt.requestFocus         InputMethodManager imm  InputMethodManager getSystemServiceContext.INPUTMETHODSERVICE         imm.toggleSoftInputInputMethodManager.SHOWFORCED, 0                codepre

Negative 6752 pBoy, am I confused. We are using Node, with Express, with Redis. We are using AWS Elastic Cache with Redis. I have a write node, and one read node, could end up with more read nodes.p  pI am currently creating a new redis client whenever I want to connect in my code. Im getting a lot of network connections, and we have been having issues. I have been reading about Redis and Node here, and a common recommendation is for one connection, that is reused, as Redis is single threaded. There are a few connection pooling modules for node and Redis, which confuses me even more. Why are they necessary, if the previous recommendation worksp  pWith Elastic Cache, if I have multiple end points, one write, any number of read, do I create one redis client connection for each, and then just endlessly reuse them I can easily roundrobin them.p

Negative 6752 pRecently I decided to develop a web application about giving away accounts for a game a metacommunity and chose Parse as my backend service. I was a newbie in network security. At first I implemented all the authentication as variable in client code and soon realized by myself that I could bypass them easily.p  pThen I moved every authentication step to Cloud Code, set up CLP and ACL. Now the client is only responsible for collecting data, putting them as parameters and calling Cloud Functions, and finally receiving the response and represent it. This was all achieved through pure JavaScript both client and cloud code.p  pNow come the other part PHP. My friend has always advised to try working with PHP instead. I also have my own dedicated server which supports PHP and also an SQL database, but we are not going into that. Now Im really teared up as Im aware of some limitations with Cloud Code like execution time limit.p  pSo my question is, what can PHP and Cloud Code do that the other cannot, and should I be too worried about either one of them Also, if you use Parse, what responsibility do you often give to PHP and Cloud Codep  pEDIT the code is not really relevant but I will try to provide some examples.

Negative 6752 pI have a below code.

I have been warned to nest data, but here it seems necessary to nest codebookscode under codeuserscode or vice versa and have a lot of duplicated data.p  pThis seems icky to me for several reasons. One is that it would require a lot of extra time to iterate over users, because their entire library would need to be iterated over as well. Second, I would need to duplicate a lot of data, because I want to display the books in their library in full, along with the synopsis and character lists, etc.p  pDo I actually need to make another segment, called codelibrarycode, where I list codeuserscode and nest their codebookscode under them Is that a valid approachp  pOr have I missed something essential here Can I actually refer to data as with a foreign key even in noSQL including Firebasep

Negative 6752 pI know that codestrlencode counts the number of characters up until and excluding the null character code0code or code0code and that codesizeofcode gives the amount of space needed to store the string including the null character, but am confused with the output of my code.p  h3Questionh3  pI expect the result of codestrlencode to be consistently 1 less than the result of codesizeofcode because my strings are nullterminated, but it only seems to be the case for the string of length 4 and 8, excluding 0 i.e. the 3rd and 5th results below.

Negative 6752 pIn C on Linux, from what I understand, if the same signal is delivered multiple times, its possible that the signal handler will be called only once. Is it possible to override this behavior Say, for example, that I have several file descriptors, and I want to be notified by a SIGIO whenever there are events on these file descriptors. So I call codefcntlcode with the command codeFSETOWNEXcode on each of them. But if there are simultaneous events on 2 file descriptors I might get only one SIGIO and then never know that an event occoured on the other file descriptor.p  pNow I know you might wonder why I want to use signals at all, rather than jusgt codeepollcode or something. The thing is Im interested in the exact time that the events happen, so I was thinking of calling codeclockgettimecode from the SIGIO signal handler to record the exact time of the event.p

Here is the code of secondActivityp  precodeImageView imageView7  ImageViewfindViewByIdR.id.imageView7 Picasso.withthis.loadR.drawable.img1.intoimageView7 codepre  pAlso when I have tried without using Picasso directly using codesetImageDrawablecode directly but in that case my app crash because of memory issues. I want to know why Picasso is unable to display my Image. In the previous activity those 10 images are displayed using Picasso and it works perfect there.p
Negative 6752 pI am new to WCF and I learned that using WCF you can communicate between two or more distributed systems over various protocols and message formats. So far for practice purposes I have used basicHttpBinding. But for demonstration purposes I want to be really convinced where to use netTcpBinding or etc. Please tell me the scenario where net.TcpBinding becomes really useful and almost a must to opt for.  Also as far as I know it is one of the major advantages that WCF offers over its traditional various counterparts such as ASP .Net Web Services that it can seamlessly communicate over various protocols which other traditional Web Services cant.  Is it true  Please clarify.p

Negative 6752 pAfter hours spent on this subject and also dozens of pages visited i am forced to ask for a help. I have seen a lot of posts on this subject, but i couldnt fix problem i get.p  pBasically, i want to do very simple thing load assembly from my folder to application. p  hr  pHere is question in short all other details are explained in rest of text I want to use Assembly.LoadFrom method to load my assembly same assembly file is referenced with project, but with CopyLocal false, but although assembly is loaded when method using it is invoked, program tries to load assembly from default locations. If it is found, then 2 same assemblies are loaded, and program uses last one, if it is not found then FileNotFoundException is raised. But, when i use same idea in Autocad plugin, everything works and exception is not raised, although files are not found.p  hr  pI have test solution with 2 simple projects TestExe console application and TestDlldll library. I want to use types from TestDll in TestExe so ive added reference to TestDlli am not referencing TestDll project, but file on specified location, but i want to load TestDll manually in the runtime. Why this is needed is explained at the end of text, with Autocad example.p  pAs far as i understand, Assembly.LoadFrom method can be used for this purpose. So basic idea is Load TestDll before method in TestExe is using it, so when method is called we have already loaded assembly. This way, whether referenced dll exists in default directories or not, we already have assembly loaded and it is going to be used.p  pFrom MSDNp  blockquote   pIf an assembly with the same identity is already loaded, LoadFrom returns the loaded assembly even if a different path was specified.p blockquote  pSo i understand that if i load dll once, every next load of same assembly also from other location will know that it is already added, so first one will be used.p  hr  pProject TestExep  precodeFile Program.cs using System namespace TestExe      class Program              static void Mainstring[] args                      Console.WriteLinenew ClassExe.ExeMethod                    File ClassExe.cs namespace TestExe      class ClassExe              public string ExeMethod                      return new TestDll.ClassDll.DllMethod                codepre  pProject TestDllp  precodeusing System.Reflection  namespace TestDll      public class ClassDll              public string DllMethod                      return Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly.Location                codepre  hr  pAs you can see, task is simple display location of called assembly.p  pLets say TestDll.dll is copied to application folder ExternTestDll.dll.p  pIf i set property CopyLocal false of reference to TestDll in TestExe project, program fails with FileNotFoundException. 1 Is it because assembly is  searched only in default directories application dir and TestDllTestDll.dllp  pThen i tried to load assembly manually, before using itp  precodestatic void Mainstring[] args              Assembly.LoadFromExternTestDll.dll         Console.WriteLinenew ClassExe.ExeMethod      codepre  pBut i get same FileNotFoundException, although TestDll has been loaded a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comwCU9h.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwCU9h.jpg altenter image description hereap  pWhen i set attribute CopyLocal true, then program works. But, it loads TestDll.dll again, from default location, and ignores assembly which is already loaded. a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com7MCkF.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7MCkF.jpg altenter image description hereap  pThe only way i managed program to work how i wanted to be used assembly ExternTestDll.dll is with using AppDomain.AssemblyResolve event.p  hr  pI have Autocad plugin which uses 10 different dlls, from different solutions. So i have plugin.dll which references 10 dll files across Documents folder, and set CopyLocal true. But, when deployed to customer, i keep only plugin.dll in application folder, and all other dlls are in Libraries subdirectory. In static constructor of plugin class, i put Assembly.LoadFrom to be loaded from Libraries subdirectory, and everything works fine.p  pSorry for long post but i wanted to explain it with details.p  pAnd thanks for any feedback  p

This function gets the state of the    person visiting this page and can return one of three states to    the callback you provide.  They can be       1. Logged into your app connected    2. Logged into Facebook, but not your app notauthorized    3. Not logged into Facebook and cant tell if they are logged into       your app or not.

Negative 6752 pIm attempting to write a vim plugin using the vim python module that handles basic bracket completion I know this exists, its more of a learning exercise.  Ive run in to an issue where Id like to remap  to a function in insert mode.  Co is an option, but when it leaves insert mode, it moves  the cursor to the left which trashes the cursor position.  As far as I can think, its impossible to tell if the  was entered at pos 0 or pos 1, because either will end up with pos of 0 while in the function call.p  pIve tried implementing it with expr or Cr, but the issue is Id like to control cursor position after the insert of the bracket i.e. move to the right of the bracket and edit the buffer both of which arent allowed in when using expr or Cr.p  pSo, is there a way to either call a function in insert mode that allows editing the bufferchanging cursor position  If not, is there a way to capture the cursor position prior to leaving insert modep

Negative 6752 pIm developing a photo sharing application with rails. Since the application will be focused on photo sharing, image upload time is important. From two points, a user shouldnt wait more than 34 seconds for an image upload and when hundreds of people are sharing photos at the same time, that shouldnt matter also.p  pA guy is talking about some good information for me a hrefhttpaaronvb.comarticlespaperclipamazons3backgrounduploadusingstarlingandworkling.html relnofollowherea.p  pFor my situtation, if I basically use paperclip gem with AWS, that means every image will be queued and if many people are posting images, they would be wait for minutes... Also I have to take care about heroku timeout...p  pSo is this true that AWS or Paperclip is not suitable for me, or what should I do to handle thisp
