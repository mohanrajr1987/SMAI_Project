Positive 6525 pThere are lots of delightful opinions about macros in Lisp, but I really cannot find a primer I can use in my every day workflow. Im web developer, but use emacs for about 10 years. And I want to understand if macros are really useful for everyone, or it is just killer feature for very specific tasks.p  pMost of the primers using macros are tryings of making DSL on top of the lisp. Well it can be useful sometimes, but creating syntax extensions in commercial development is a bad practice as far as I understand. Most of languages has standard features like for, if, while, foreach operators, common conceptions like classes, namespaces, modules, closureslambdas. So all programs are typically built from such pieces, and new programmer examining your code already knows that pieces and can operate them. And in case of DSL built upon macros, the programmer needs not only to explore business logic, but also learn your DSL. Commercial development gravities to typical solutions with easy support and high replaceability of programmers.p  pNext  creating template engines on top of the macros. Well, the industry standard now is Twig, Jinja2, Template Toolkit  you can create your own template system, but... It is 2015 now, not 2001 when Paul Grahams Viaweb was created. Modern templating systems are very similar to each other  they was developed for years and they have lots of conceptions like blocks, filters, inheritance, i18n. So in 2001 creating own templating engine had sense, but now there complex templating engines for all suddens of life.p  pNext  using macros to create algorithms independent on data passed to them. This conception makes sense, but does it really need macros For example most of scripting languages support of passing functions by reference  that means you can create abstract function which will accept data and dataprocessing function as arguments. Of course you will need to create few dataprocessing functions to support all needed data types, but you will be able to pass all those ones to abstract function which will be short as comparable lisp macro.p  pNext  algorithms itself. Nowadays 90 of us, webdevelopers, are just using ready libraries and algorithms. So even if Im totally wrong in previous paragraph, the role of macros is very small in our job.p  pSo do you really use macros everyday, or you just arely shoot some problem with macros very elegantly and extrapolate that hapinees on next few monthesp

Positive 6525 pSo, in weaklytyped C IIRC, 0 is evaluated as false in a boolean context like a conditional expression and everything else is truthy. Modern dynamic languages seem to split on whether or not zero is falsy python, php, and javascript say yesruby, lua, clojure, and racket say no.p  pQuestion is, why I googled for my question title and found a hrefhttpsnews.ycombinator.comitemid2266083 relnofollowthisa thread on hacker news which had interesting stuff but not the answer to my question. Substituting lisp for clojure in my search yielded no historical reference.p  pSo to be more precise in formulating my question is there an actual technical advantage to zero evaluating as true in a conditional expression, or did it just become a quasistandard in dynamic languages that werent as influenced by C courtesy of the early lisps Its definitely a bit odd to a programmer used to Cpythonjavascript.p

Negative 6525 pThe situationp  pWe have a library project that houses much of our code for the various integrations we work on.  Many of the integrations consume web service apis, and my supervisor doesnt want 5 gazillion web service references added to the project.p  pWhat we generally do, then, is add a reference to a new project and copy the References.vb to the solution and just call the generated code.  Not terribly convenient if changes are made to the service, but it works.p  pRecently, I ran into a problem where we have to use 3 web services for the same integration.  2 of these contain the same class definitions, however, theyre in different namespaces because they belong to different services.  This became a problem for me because one of the services searches a user based on user ID, and the other pulls back blocks of users.  Both return an object, or list of, that is exactly the same semantically.  And I need to process the data the same, whether it came from one service or the other.p  pMy solution, was to strip out the duplicated classes in the service and replace them with classes inherited from common base classes.  This allowed me to work with both objects as if they were the same, however, it required modifying the generated web service proxy.  Therefore this change will need to be made every time I need to regenerate the proxy.p  pIm curious what you all might think a better solution to this would be.p

All these routers have the same password I know, its wrong, and the script needs to know that password in order to be able to connect to the routers.

Negative 6525 pI have written a Google App Engine application that programatically generates a bunch of HTML code that is really the same output for each user who logs into my system, and I know that this is going to be inefficient when the code goes into production. So, I am trying to figure out the best way to cache the generated pages. p  pThe most probable option is to generate the pages and write them into the database, and then check the time of the database put operation for a given page against the time that the code was last updated. Then, if the code is newer than the last put to the database for a particular HTML request, new HTML will be generated and served, and cached to the database. If the code is older than the last put to the database, then I will just get the HTML direct from the database and serve it therefore avoiding all the CPU wastage of generating the HTML. I am not only looking to minimize load times, but to minimize CPU usage.p  pHowever, one issue that I am having is that I cant figure out how to programatically check when the version of code uploaded to the app engine was updated. p  pI am open to any suggestions on this approach, or other approaches for caching generated html.p  pNote that while memcache could help in this situation, I believe that it is not the final solution since I really only need to regenerate html when the code is updated as opposed to every time the memcache expires.p

Negative 6525 pIve done a bit of Linq programming with TDD ASP.Net MVC and loved it.  Digressing, Im now learning webforms against stored procs and cannot use linq.  I would like to retain some of the loose coupling and testability enjoyed with MVC.  p  pI didnt have the time to learn and setup a dependency injection infrastructure so instead I created an object factory that can be configured to create either mock or actual instances depending on what is required.  p  pThe problem with this approach is the factory serves new instances of my test repositories, so when entity A asks for the repository for entity B it gets a fresh instance without the changes made in the context of my unit test  this is the problem.  Since my test instances have no persistence mechanism and Im not using dependence injection, I need a way for the Entity A to access the current data context of my unit test so it can get the    dirty repository of Entity B.  For desktop apps Id usually create my dataContext as a singleton but due to concurrency issues with webapps Ive ruled that out. p  pIm looking for a nice pattern to follow instead.  As a stop gap Ive required that all repositories and business objects be instantiated with a data context creating a kind of hierarchy where dataContext instantiates repository with dc which in turn instantiates business objects with dc.  p  pIve not used a composite pattern, inheritance or interfaces except for mocking.  Im not much of an OO programmer but this looks pretty ugly.  Has any one got any nice pattern suggestions I should follow that could tidy up my solutionp  pTIAp

As far as I understand, there is a service which should be located in the server side, but this is not possible for various reasons including the fact that it is a linux machine. Furthermore, I have yet to figure out how to make a mysql sync provider.p  pMy solution, and this is an ugly one mind you, is to create a Java web service on the server that is responsible for tracking each Windows Mobiles sync requests and respond appropriately. Here is how I think it will gop  pEach Windows Mobile device will contain a local database SQL Compact. When there is an active internet connection, it will send a request to the web service to sync their database sending along their username and password. The web service will look for the last sync request from these credentials which is a dump of the database at the time of the request and compare it with the current database state. The service will only send the changes as a response. Once the response is sent, it will store the current database state as the users last sync request for the next one. All the Windows Mobile device has to do is follow the response simple CRUD statements.p  pSo, my question, finally, is strongHow can I store the database state in order to later compare it with a future statestrongp  pOf course, needless to say, if there is a better solution that can be done quickly, I can discard this whole idea. p  pFor this case, here is what you need to know the server is running linux. The database on it is MySQL and I cannot modify the schema. I can however install software on the server, like a webservice. Finally, the Windows Mobile devices are currently running SQL Compact. And of course, this should not cost anything since it will not be the final solution which will use the Microsoft Sync Framework once I get to figure out some things.p  pThank you very very much.

Negative 6525 pHi i would like to know how to create custom values for the dataTable. For example I want to do some calculations for the values that will be placed in the dataTable. But what happens is that I get an error  emERROR errors.GrailsExceptionResolver   Executing action [dataTableJSON] of controller [com.MeetingController]  caused exception org.hibernate.QueryException could not resolve property editedDate of com.Meeting org.codehaus.groovy.grails.web.servlet.mvc.exceptions.ControllerExecutionException Executing action [dataTableJSON] of controller [com.MeetingController]  caused exception org.hibernate.QueryException could not resolve property editedDate of com.Meeting.em p  pIt cannot sort properly the specified field for the emlist mapem if it isnt a field of the domain class. Okay, for example i passed a static keyvalue pair of fooKey 2  in the list map that will be passed as a JSON. What happens is that it cant figure out how to sort it since it isnt an attribute of the domain class. or even if the key has the same name in the domain class eg., editedDate but if we do some calculations or change stuff here eg., new Dateit.editedDate it still cant figure out how to sort these values properlyp  pI really dont know whats the problem since Im a noob here in grails, web dev, hibernate, and  yui javascript stuff. I would appreciate if you could help me figure out or understand some concepts here that Im not yet familiar of.p  pWhat I want to do is to sort the list of meetings in order of the recent update. SO given the lastEdited field of the Domain Class Meeting, I can sort it that way with sortOrder desc but what happens is if I click the next page or page 2 for that matter, the new ordering will become asc which is contrary to what the ordering of the first list. For example p  pMeeting A , last edited  301pm Meeting B , last edited  302pm Meeting C , last edited  303pm Meeting D , last edited  304pmp  pso if the datable is sorted in descending order by editedDate with a maximum of two rows per page. the result will bep  pFirst Page current page shown ul liMeeting D li liMeeting C li ulp  pSecond Pageul liMeeting B li liMeeting A li ulp  pBut what happens after page 2 is clicked, it will becomep  pFirst Page ul liMeeting A  li liMeeting B li ulp  pSecond Page  current page shown ul liMeeting C li liMeeting D li ulp  pinstead of showing the following second pagep  pFirst Page ul liMeeting D li liMeeting C li ulp  pSecond Page current page shown ul liMeeting B li liMeeting A li ulp  pSo Im thinking of a workaround so that I will be needing data that will use asc order instead of desc so that the list of meetings will be ordered by recently editted. And that is to subtract the current time with the editedDate attribute of Meeting.Hmmm.. its like saying that i can order the list of meetings by descending order with the editedDate or i could use an ascending order of meetings by their ago time ie, the time passed starting the time now and the time it was last editted, new Date.getTime it.editedDate . But the problem here is that if I tamper the value of the editedDate, the table cant sort it properly hence, the aforementioned error.p  pstrongOk, so my main problem is how to sort using the guidataTable by recently editted Meetings and would work properly with pagination.strongp  pSub problemsp  ul li using a sortOrderdesc with the pagination, since its default are asc li lihow to add a customized value of the data Table so that it can sort properly if i clicked the headers li ul  pSorry for the long inquiry.

Negative 6525 pIn my web app, users can input text data. This data can be shown to other users, and the original author can also go back and edit their data. Im looking for the correct way to safely escape this data.p  pIm only sql sanitizing on the way in, so everything is stored as it reads. Lets say I have dj vu in the database. Or, to be more extreme, a codeltscriptgtcode tag. It is possible that this may be valid, and not even maliciously intended, input.p  pIm using codehtmlentitiescode on the way out to make sure everything is escaped. The problem is that html and input fields treat things differently. I want to make sure its safe in HTML, but that the author when editing the text, sees exactly what they typed in the input fields. Im also using jQuery to fill form fields with the data dynamically.p  pIf I do thisp  precode ltpgtlthtmlentitiesdj vugtltpgt  ltinput typetext valuelthtmlentitiesdj vugtgt codepre  pThe page source puts codedampeacutejampagrave vucode in both places I had to backtick that or you would see deacutejagrave vu The problem is that the output in the codeltpgtcode is correct, but the input just shows the escaped text. If the user resubmits their form, they double escape and ruin their input.p  pI know I still have to sanitize text that goes into the field, otherwise you can end the value quote and do bad things. The only solution I found is this. Again, Im using jQuery.p  precodevar temp  ltdivgtltdivgt.htmllthtmlentitiesdj vugt input.valtemp.html codepre  pThis works, as it causes the div to read the escaped text as encoded characters, and then the jquery copies those encoded characters to the input tag, properly preserved.p  pSo my question is this still safe, or is there a security hole somewhere And more importantly, is this the only  correct way to do this Am I missing something about how html and character encoding works that make this a trivial issue to solvep  h3EDITh3  pThis is actually wrong, I oversimplified my example to the point of it not working. The problem is actually because Im using jQuerys val to insert the text into the field.p  precodeltinputgt ltscriptgtinput.vallthtmlentitiesdj vugtltscriptgt codepre  pThe reason for this is that the form is dynamic  the user can add or remove fields at will and so they are generated after page load.p  pSo it seems that jQuery is escaping the data to go into the input, but its not quite good enough  if I dont do anything myself, a user can still put in a codeltscriptgtcode tag, killing my code and inserting malicious code. But theres another argument to be made here. Since only the original author can see the text in an input box anyway, should I even bother Basically the only people they could execute an XSS attack against is themselves.p

Negative 6525 pHey guys, Im moving to subversion.p  pI have 2 different websites based on the same codebase with heavy differences they differ about 15. Sites both have 10K files. When I develop something for A, I sometimes synch B with changes, or changes may be specific to A, or vice versa.p  pSo I think it will be logical to have them as two branches in the same repo, and the trunk may be empty for now.p  pI know a similar compression will apply for the svn file system anyway, but will it be completely ok if I initially commit these as two branches Or should Ip  ul licreate amp commit the default folder structure,li licommit A as the first branch,li licopy 1st branch as 2nd branchli liupdate the working copy,li lidelete the 2nd branch in the working copy,li licopy B site to the 2nd branch in the working copy,li licommitli ul  pso the server will know or not unchanged files between branches, and keep them as lazy copiesp  pBtw, some file dates may differ though they have the same content, as usual.p

Negative 6525 pI am having a compilation problem with my code in Delphi 2006. I am using a static String arrayp  precodefsinames  array [0..FSINUMVARS1] of string codepre  pIn a procedure I call at the start of the program, I assign values to this array. This code is automatically generated by a script that I wrote. It consists of lines similar to the next onep  precodefsinames[idFSIFLIGHTPATHANGLE]  FSIFLIGHTPATHANGLE codepre  pThere are overall around 2000 elements to be assigned in this array. I couldnt find out  the magic number where the compiler dies, but it works with 1853 and doesnt with 2109.p  pThe thing is that I need this array to convert an ID which is the index to the array to a name as a string for various applications.p  pI know that if I would split the list of assignments and put the parts into different procedures, then it works out. But since the code is autogenerated and changes often, this method is not quite comfortable.p  pI also thought about putting the contents into a file and read it at runtime, but I would rather keep the number of files I have to ship to a minimum. Also, I would like to protect the contents from the average user, so that he doesnt mess with it.p  pDo you have an idea how I could either overcome the limitation of the compiler, or change my code to achieve my goalp  pHelp is very much appreciated.p

Negative 6525 pA while ago I created a small cardgame web app for fun. The player plays against the computer and mostly it works fine. Sometimes though the computer player gets into a loop, the point of the game is to lose all your cards and if you dont have a card to play you take the pile. Sometimes the computer plays x,y,z, takes the pile, plays x,yz, takes the pile etc. p  pI keep track of the moves Ive made, so at any point I have an array that looks something like  [C2,D5,strongH2,S4,C5,H2,S4,C5,H2,S4,C5strong]p  pIn this case I can see that Ive gotten into a loop of playing H2,S4,C5, then taking the pile and then repeating.p  pSo, the generalized problem is, whats the best way to detect repeating patterns in a list I could probably whip something up using a simple for loop, trying to find the card Im about to play and if I find that in position x then I could check whether the pattern from x to n repeats at position xnx to x, but this seems like the kind of problem that could have a nice algorithm for it.

Of course, we have to sacrifice many features, e.g. constraints, transactions, unique key generation, etc. But compared with what we get, these can also be compensated or patched, one way or another. p  pSo, I guess my question is, does anyone really have any real problem with using such combo as a database in a serious appp

Negative 6525 pI have an upcoming project in which a core requirement will be to mutate the way a method works at runtime. Note that Im emnotem talking about a higher level OO concept like shadow one method with another, although the practical effect would be similar.p  pThe key properties Im after arep  ul lipI must be able to modify the method in such a way that I can add new expressions, remove existing expressions, or modify any of the expressions that take place in it.pli lipAfter modifying the method, subsequent calls to that method would invoke the new sequence of operations. Or, if the language binds methods rather than evaluating every single time, provide me a way to unbindrebind the new method.pli lipIdeally, I would like to manipulate the atomic units of the emlanguageem e.g., invoke method codefoocode on object codebarcode and not the assembly directly e.g. pop these three parameters onto the stack.

Negative 6525 pHey all, I seem to have these types of methods everywhere.p  pThe method below wants to do these simple tasksp  ol liOpen a DB connection IntLMPDB objectli liRead a simple record off a small DB table the DB table is keyed with strings, because each string is the name of method, so I want just one row of each in the table, the rest of the row is a series of timestamps that tell me when things happned.li liIf you cant find the record, then return an exception because theres nothing that can be done.li liIf you find the record, look at the second date if its just plain missing, then set to true because this is the first ever run. li liOr finally get to the meat, if the first date is greater than the second set to True because its been updated and its time to run. Else if not, set to False because theres no update yet.li ol  pSo heres the code... What I am trying to do is pare this down to the best and quickest way to run through these checks. I am not concerned about like DB connection issues or anything like that.p  precode    private static bool isLastIntervalNewerThanDBstring muiMethod             using var db  new IntLMPDB                       Try to load a matching record.             LastIntervalUpdated liRec  db.LastIntervalUpdateds.FirstOrDefaultrec gt rec.method  muiMethod              If it could not be loaded, exit because theres no way to determine if we should run.              if liRec  null  throw new Exceptionstring.FormatCould NOT find LastIntervalUpdated record for muiMethod 0, muiMethod              else                               we have a valid interval record, so lets check that it has been updated since the last webPostTime.                  put another way, there are three datetime values in the LastIntervalUpdated table. First is the                  interval itself, second is the retrievalTime and third is the webPostTime. Whenever the MUI is                   checked for a new interval if one is found then the code updates the retrievalTime to the current                  instant in time. This tells us what the last interval this application found on its last run was.                  The thrid value is the webPostTime, this time instant is only updated by this very method were in                  right here. We can use this logic if the retrievalTime is greater than the webPostTime then theres                  a newer interval that we havent yet processed and inserted into the databse. So we should run the                  method below and update ALL of the syncable values into the databse. Then well set the dbPostTime to                   the current instance. As it goes, if this program then runs again before the interval is updated                  then the dbPostTime will be greater than the retrieval time and well know to do nothig. Simple Right                    or check here includes a NULL check on dbPostTime because its possible that dbPostTime is NULL,                  in the example of the first time the system runs. It might have run a LastUpdate sync and not yet                  done this method, so dbPostTime would be NULL. None of the other columns are allowed to be null.                 if liRec.dbPostTimeEST  null  liRec.retrievalTimeEST gt liRec.dbPostTimeEST                  return true                  else  return false                            codepre

This works fine and I am able to receive messages and then echo them back to the client.p  pMy problem is though that Im not sure the best way of transferring a message from one client to another through the server. p  pI think my biggest issue is that codereadcode blocks, so I wont be able to send a message to a client until the client sends some text to the server so that read stops blocking.p  pIs there any way around this My initial thought was to make one thread for reading from the client and one for writing to the client but if read is blocking in one thread and then I try to write to the same file descriptor then wont this cause issuesp  pAppreciate any help p

Negative 6525 pIs there a way to get some details regarding exception safety aspects of Javas standard classes Mainly working with C and C, Im confused with Java exception specifications, so I need to understand the proper way of working with exceptions.p  pTo be more specific, lets consider codeServerSocketcode. It starts listening for incoming connections as soon as its object is constructed. Then, you should use codeacceptcode to accept the connection if someone tries to connect.p  pIn case youve previously configured your server socket with codesetSoTimeoutcode, theres a change that codeacceptcode will throw codeSocketTimeoutExceptioncode because nobody tried to connect in a specified period of time. Thats fine, server socket is still usable, so you just call codeacceptcode once again.p  pBut codeSocketTimeoutExceptioncode is not the only thing that codeacceptcode may throw. What does all the other exceptions mean If I wrap call to codeacceptcode with 2 catch clauses for codeSocketTimeoutExceptioncode and codeIOExceptioncode, can I still emsafelyem use the related codeServerSocketcode instance after I got into codeIOExceptioncode clausep  pId really appreciate both Javawide and ServerSocketspecific answers.p

Negative 6525 pI am using EmguCV 2.3.0 and am querying frames at random intervals from a Capture to be saved to hard drive. The problem is when I call the Capture.QueryFrame or Capture.QuerySmallFrame it is delayed by a frame. To make this more clear I start the program and query a frame pointed at my face. My face appears in the .jpeg. I then point the camera away from my face and query another frame, and my face appears in the .jpeg again. I then point it back at my face once more, query a frame and the .jpeg contains the image pointed away from my face. There appears to be a 1 frame delay in a query. Is there some underlying buffer What is causing this And most importantly how can I solve this problem without querying multiple frames for a single captured imagep  pAnother question I have is that when I set the webcam resolution to 1600x1200, the program and computer begins to lag  even without making use of the images or querying frames. Is that caused only because I create a Capture and keep it in memory Is there a way to lessen the affects of thisp  pNote This solution is not sufficient for quick acquisition of frames, the question continues here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7514715systemtypeinitializationexceptionusingemgucvincSystem.TypeInitializationException using Emgu.CV in Cap
Negative 6525 pI have a Django app that gets nearrealtime data tweets and votes, although updates occur only every minute or two on average.  However we want to show the data by updating the site and api results right when it comes in.p  pWe might see a whole ton of load on this site, so my initial thought is of course cachingp  pIs it practical to have some sort of Memcached cache that gets invalidated manually by another process or event  In other words, I would cache views for a long time, and then have new tweets and votes invalidate the entire view. p  ul liDo the perhaps modest performance enhancements justify the added complexityli liIs there a practical implementation I could create I work with other developers, so hacking tons of stuff around each response call isnt a good optionli ul  pIm not concerned about invalidating only some of the objects, and I considered subclassing the codeMemcachedCachecode backend to add some functionality following a hrefhttpcode.google.compmemcachedwikiFAQDeletingbyNamespacethis strategya.

However, if we open the RTSP stream on the Galaxy Tab, there is a lag of 67s.  I have tried to set down the bitrate encoding even the lowest doesnt work, the streaming lag results the same.

Negative 6525 pIve been searching a long time for some guidance or examples of web form design of large forms dozens of fields  maybe 50 for a user base that will be trained on the application.  p  p99.9 of the guidance seems to be geared toward accessibility or intuitiveness which are, by all means, valid goals.  The issue is that a form that will be used on a oneoff or infrequent basis by users who will likely be encountering it for the first or only time has much different considerations required compared with a form for data entry to a business application that will be used repeatedly all day long by users who are trained on the app.  p  ul liIf Im designing for a oneoff say a signup form then I want to focus on designing the form so that the user cant help but flow naturally through the steps and end up completing their goal and feeling all warm and fuzzy.  li liIf Im designing for an experienced user that will use the form 20x a day, they are going to want it designed to minimize the clicks and navigations, etc.  They dont care [as much] about looks or flair and subtle cues to help them work through the form.  They know the form like the back of their hand and just want to be able to enter data as quickly as possible and see as much as possible in one view.li ul  pThe requirements that Im getting from the users is that they want to see everything on one screen.  They dont want to have to scroll.  They want to minimize clicking to other pages to continue working.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestionslinksdirewarningsp  pThanks, Davep

I dont want to allow all certs for security reasons. I am not sure about why this exception is thrown but it seems that either verisign is issueing the wrong root certificate or android has not implemented the root in its truststore.

Negative 6525 pIm trying to setup SimpleCov to generate reports for 3 applications that share most of their codemodels, controllers from a local gem but the specs for the code that each app uses are inside each .spec and not on the gem itself.p  pFor a clearer example. When i run bundle exec rspec spec inside app1 that uses the shared models from the local gem I want to getaccurate reports for all the specs that this app1 has inside .spec.p  pThe local gem also has some models that belong exclusively for app2, inside a namespace, so i want to skip the report for those files when i run the test suite inside app1.p  pIm trying to achieve this with something like the following code in app1specspechelper. p  precode This couple of lines are needed to generate report for the models, etc. inside the local gem.

Kind of unexpected.p  pBut since this file was on app2 i decided to add a filter on the SimpleCov.start block on app1 spechelper, likep  precodeaddfilter app2namespace codepre  pI moved then to the app2 folder and started setting up SimpleCov and see what results i would get here. And they turned out weirder. p  pFor the same model i got 100 coverage, i did the same test of emptying the mymodelspec.rb file and still got the 100.

Negative 6525 pI made a whole bunch of changes to one of the branches. Now I am trying to merge these changes with the trunk. In order to do that I created two working folders on my machine called BRANCH and TRUNK. I did an svn co of branch in the BRANCH directory and an svn co of trunk in the TRUNK folder. Once the check out was complete, I went ahead and opened up the subversion history of all the checkins I did on the branch. Once I got the version numbers for all my checkins, I went within my TRUNK folder and issued the following commandp  precode svn merge dryrun r1xx01xx1 svnsshpathtomybranch codepre  pThe funny thing is that the above command executes without any output, which essentially indicates my branch and my version do not have any differences. Which is not possible since the content of the files for the version I am trying to merge are different.p  pDoes somebody have some ideas on what might be going wrong herep  pThanksp

Negative 6525 pIm starting a small project, basically a multiplayer as in more than two players variation of the classic Battleship game.p  pOne problem that Im trying to resolve before I dive into coding is the problem of communication between the multiple players. A current possibility is to use a central HTTP server as the central hub for communication coupled with the Android C2DM API to allow push communication from the HTTP server to the devices. This seems a nice solution, because in theory as long as you have access to the Internet it should work perfectly, whether you are behind a NAT or not.p  pHowever, the proposed solution has the disadvantage of existing one single point of failureextra load the webserver. So Id like to try other options. I thought of making direct connections using Sockets between the clients with the webserver just being used as an initial meeting point, however this would only work well if all the devices were in the same network. Considering that today we are almost always behind the NAT of a router how can I achieve direct communication Ive been reading about hole punching but I cant find any good library that is well documented containing good examples of use and that works on Android for sure. Also most if not all hole punching techniques STUN, ICE, etc... widely available only work with UDP, which is fine for audiovideo and real time multiplayer games that can lose some messages, but for a multiplayer turnbased game its important to guarantee the delivery of the data of each turn something that its not possible directly with UDP.p  pSo any ideas how to achieve a reliable hole punching preferably over TCP between strongAndroidstrong devices behind NAT It doesnt have to work on 100 of the cases some stranger NATs may not be supported but it would be nice if it worked on most cases.p

Negative 6525 pI have an Ntier application, ASP.Net front end, then a .Net C Business and Data Access Layer. I have created a simple custom logging library. This logging library is then used throughout my application i.e. Log.LogException and Log.LogMessage.p  pFor this logging library I want to define the custom path for the logs folder created by my application. I initially thought the correct approach was to use an App.Config for my Logging library and then read in the path from there but the problem is that when I publish my Web App to its Target Location it copes all the binaries across including the logging DLL but not the accompanying App.Config.p  pThis leads me to believe that this is not the right approach. I could do some hack to copy it across but that is a bad idea if it is not the best design approach.p  pIs this a supported design or am I going down the wrong routep  pThanks   p

Negative 6525 pIm developing a Zend MVC on my local machine, and am using a DreamHost site for staging. As per the a hrefhttpframework.zend.commanualenzend.application.quickstart.html relnofollowzend quick starta, on my local machine I set my APPLICATIONENV to development from within a .htaccess file in the public directory of the project, like thisp  blockquote   pmyprojectpublic.htaccess contains this line, p      pSetEnv APPLICATIONENV developmentp blockquote  pThis works just fine locally. But when I try to use my appenv in my staging server its not there to use. This a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5764469zendsetenvinhtaccessnotworkingthreada suggested that perhaps suexec was running in the background. I did some digging and sure enough, a hrefhttpwiki.dreamhost.comSuexec relnofollowDreamhost blocks custom environment variablesa.p  pI tried the first workaround that DH suggested, by prepending HTTP to APPLICATIONENV, and then adding another conditional within publicindex.php to check for both the original and the dreamhost version.p  precode Define application environment definedAPPLICATIONENV  defineAPPLICATIONENV,    getenvAPPLICATIONENV  getenvAPPLICATIONENV     getenvHTTPAPPLICATIONENV  getenvHTTPAPPLICATIONENV  production codepre  pThis didnt seem to work for me. Even in ssh, when I run env in the command line, my applicationenv isnt listed. Since Im not working with CGI script I didnt bother with the second and third workarounds.p  ptldrp  pSo, as far as I understand it, my options are to either create my own config system save appenv to a different file, load that file in publicindex.php which seems like more work than its worth considering option 2 or just hard code the appenv into the default position  meaning, instead of production in the code example above it would just say staging. If I went with the latter, Id have to .gitignore my publicindex.php file, which just seems a little strange. Before this, Ive never had to change that file and would assume that its better if I dont mess with it, let alone completely leave it outside of my repository.

Im curious why Chrome works like this. Serving the original unmodified DOM after using the back button makes sense, but why is the only select option not selectedp

I thought that codein[idx] amp in[idxN]code leads to noncoalesced access, because of accessing noncontiguous memory. But in fact, codein[idx]code and codein[idxN]code are loaded in two coalesced steps. codeNcode can be any multiple of 16, because uchar4 is 4 bytes long, and for coalesced access address must be aligned to 64 bytes on 1.1 device.

Negative 6525 pIm trying to build into a little app the ability to type text and copy it over to the canvas.    Best bet is to look at this demo a hrefhttpwww.websanova.comdemo relnofollowhttpwww.websanova.comdemoap  pClick on the T icon then start typing some text, youll notice when it actually copies over to the canvas as it will jump a few pixels.p  pThe alignment as far as the canvastextarea should be okay and the few pixels the text jumps can vary on font sizefamily and whether bolditalics is enabled or not, so basically hard coding some kind of offset will not workunless we cover all scenarios individually.  Not to mention it also varies between browsersp  pFrom what I can gather this is because of the textBaseline property but it seems that the way it aligns in a textarea and the way canvas handles it are different.p  pIve tried setting it to hangingalphabeticideographicmiddletop but cant find anything consistent between font sizefamily etc...p  pDoes anyone know of a way to possibly calculate this somehow so that it consistently positions properlyp  pCan be forked on github as well here a hrefhttpsgithub.comwebsanovawPaint relnofollowhttpsgithub.comwebsanovawPaintap

Negative 6525 pA lot of people like me are used to JavaScript in the respect that code is executed in the order of loading, i.e. from top to bottom, so if an element hasnt yet loaded it is impossible to manipulate it, or if a function has not yet been defined it is impossible to call it. Since JS and VBscript, but thats not too popular is the only internet clientside programming scripting, if you wish language, and therefore the only language to come across the problem of having to be loaded from a different location, I assume that no other language does that, i.e. one can call a functionmethod in the language, while having defined it later on in the document. Is this assumption correct, or are there other languages that do that toop  pEDIT for those who dont understand what I mean, heres an example in Javap  precodepublic class MainClass      public static void mainString[] args          SomeClass SomeObject  new SomeClass         SomeObject.changeSomeVariablesomeValue       class SomeClass      String someVariable     void changeSomeVariablenewValue         someVariable  newValue       codepre  pNote how the class defining the object goes emafterem the line where the object is created.

Negative 6525 pI am working on a .NET application for processing geographic data that uses ESRIs ArcObjects COM library via ESRIs own .NET interop assemblies.p  pWhen running in production, the process can crash during some operations due to reaching the 2GB perprocess memory limit. ArcObjects is a 32bit library. This is because some of the processing steps can create many temporary ArcObjects geometry objects. It will leak memory and eventually run out of memory despite manually releasing these objects using a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.runtime.interopservices.marshal.finalreleasecomobject.aspx relnofollowcodeFinalReleaseComObjectcodea and associated helper methods. However, I can force the GC to release the memory by calling a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.gc.waitforpendingfinalizers.aspx relnofollowcodeWaitForPendingFinalizerscodea, and calling it regularly along with codeGC.Collectcode and codeFinalReleaseComObjectcode keeps the memory usage under control. Otherwise, many objects remain in memory until the process exits normally or abnormally.p  pstrongFirst questionstrong why isnt the memory held by the ArcObjects COM objects released immediately Or, why does the GC allow the process to crash instead of finalizing the released COM objects and reclaiming the memory before it crashesp  pThe application runs in production on Windows 2008 64bit, while I develop using Windows 7 32bit. I can get the process to crash on the production boxes, but not on my development box. I thought that this may have been because locally I usually run in Visual Studio with a Debug build, but I have also tried it without the debugger Start Without Debugging using a Release build but even then it didnt use anywhere near as much memory as in production and wont crash.p  pstrongSecond questionstrong Whyp  pEDIT In my previous experiments, I worked out that codeGC.Collectcode by itself is not sufficient, even though I was calling it explicitly. I have a utility method that calls codeGC.Collectcode followed by codeGC.WaitForPendingFinalizerscode and calling it after every algorithm iteration keeps memory usage down.p

My typical use scenario is User opens web page GAE and request some info from remote device Device gets message, and sends it back to user through web page.p  pSending messages to phone is piece of cake thanks to GCM. Hard part is return response to user. The only one idea I have is inserting response to datastore, then it query repetitively, But there are some disadvantages delay in the communication and excessive usage of the datastore and its quotas.p  pI have heard and read about channels API, but when I when using GAE there is strong possibility, that both clients will connect to different machines.

Message is addressed to user logged in with GWT and another servlet and having its own session instance.

I just need to implement some kind of mailbox. At this moment I see memcache in this role. Perfect for it should be some service like amazon sms, but having my app dispatched between many servers makes me a bit unhappy. Queues are other idea, but not those from GAE.

This is what I have checked.p  precodeCGRect frame  [[UIScreen mainScreen] applicationFrame] UIInterfaceOrientation orientation2  [[UIApplication sharedApplication] statusBarOrientation] UIInterfaceOrientation orientation  [[UIDevice currentDevice] orientation] codepre  pBasically I want to know the orientation a photo is taken in but if the camera picker is loaded up in portrait and phone is turned to landscape after that the result orientation of photo is portrait. I was hoping to be able to check the actual device orientation at moment the photo was taken and transform it accordingly. Any ideas on how to approach this p  pedit I am going to look into using the gyro for this will report back how that goes.p  pedit sorry i should have mentioned that the phone itself is in fixed portrait orientation.but is there a way of getting around that to see what it actually isp

Negative 6525 pI am trying to create an editor where the user can either select an existing item or create a new one inline. For example, imagine the typical personaddress relationship. I want a form where the user, when editing a person, can either select an address from a set of existing addresses or create a new address without moving to a separate form.p  pNaively, this seems to require two different editors for the same property. Say I have a codePersoncode which has codeAddress getAddresscode and codesetAddressAddresscode. My codePersonEditorcode class would need to have two subeditors named codeaddresscode of differing types one to select an existing person and the another a composite of editors to descend into the codeAddresscode type and allow editing of its properties.p  pFrom reading the documentation on a hrefhttpgooglewebtoolkit.googlecode.comsvnjavadoc2.5comgooglegwteditorclientCompositeEditor.html relnofollowcodeCompositeEditorcodea, it seems like I have to make use of it to dynamically select the subeditor. However, the documentation isnt detailed enough for me to really understand how I should implement the interface. Ive tried looking at how a hrefhttpgooglewebtoolkit.googlecode.comsvnjavadoc2.5comgooglegwteditorclientadaptersListEditor.html relnofollowcodeListEditorcodea and codeOptionalFieldEditorcode are implemented for clues, but to avail. codeListEditorcode doesnt seem like a straight fit as my subeditors edit different paths.p  pFor instance, trying to use codeCompositeEditorcode, Im unclear on what codecreateEditorForTraversalcode and codegetPathElementcode should return in my case.p  pHow do I dynamically attach one of two emdifferentem types of editors to one propertyp

Negative 6525 pI have three tables Im dealing with for a signup form [months], [members], and [monthsmembers]. That last one is simply a join table. They look something like thisp  precode[months]  [id] INT Primary Key [name] VARCHAR50 [date] DATE  [members]  [id] INT Primary Key [fname] VARCHAR50 [lname] VARCHAR50 [email] VARCHAR300  [monthsmembers]  [id] INT Primary Key [monthid] INT [memberid] INT codepre  pSo, pretty simple, conceptually. Theres a set list of members, and they can sign up for certain months. The form that I have, which allows them to sign up for different months, actually lets administrators enter or change all of the signups all at once. And so I was hoping to use a MERGE statement to get the data into the database with a single query, rather than iterating through multiple queries.p  pSo heres what I started to write even though I know this is not correct syntaxp  precodeMERGE INTO [monthsmembers] mm INNER JOIN [months] mo ON mo.[id]  mm.[monthid]  USING      SELECT 1 AS [monthid], 1 AS [memberid] UNION ALL     SELECT 2 AS [monthid], 3 AS [memberid] UNION ALL     SELECT 4 AS [monthid], 4 AS [memberid]  AS u ON mm.[monthid]  u.[monthid] AND mm.[memberid]  u.[memberid]  WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN      INSERT [monthid], [memberid] VALUES u.[monthid], u.[memberid]  WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE AND DATEPARTYEAR, mo.[start]  2013 THEN      DELETE codepre  pHopefully that illustrates the problem Im running into. I want to insert any new data from the codeUSINGcode subquery into the code[monthsmembers]code table. And I also want to delete anything from the code[monthsmembers]code table that is emnotem present in the codeUSINGcode subquery  but emonly ifem it corresponds to a month in the current year. If there is data not present in the codeUSINGcode subquery that corresponds to a different year, I do emnotem want to delete that. I want to leave that historical data alone. So the codeDATEPARTcode condition is the kicker.p  pSo Im inserting into one table, code[monthsmembers]code, but I also need it to be aware of the code[months]code table. Is there any way to accomplish this Or will I have to concede and iterate through a number of SQL queriesp

Negative 6525 pI am writing a WCF service that has source data from multiple sources.  These are large files in various formats.  p  pI have implemented Caching and setup a polling interval so these files are kept up to date with fresh data.  p  pI have constructed a manager class that basically is responsible for returning XDocument objects back to the caller.  The manager class first checks the cache for existence.  If it doesnt exist  it makes the call to retrieve fresh data.  Nothing big here.  p  pWhat I would like to do to keep the response snappy is serialize the file previously downloaded and pass that back to the caller  again nothing new...however...I want to spawn a new thread as soon as the serialization is complete to retrieve the fresh data and overwrite the old file.  This is my problem...p  pAdmittedly an intermediate programmer  I came across a few examples on multithreading here for that matter...The problem is it introduced the concept of delegates and I am really struggling with this.  p  pHere is some of my codep  precodethis method invokes another object that is responsible for making the      http call, decompressing the file and persisting to the hard drive.     private static void downloadFilestring url, string LocationToSave              using WeatherFactory wf  new WeatherFactory                      wf.getWeatherDataSourceurl, LocationToSave                    A new thread variable     private static Thread backgroundDownload      the delegate...but I am so confused on how to use this...     delegate void FileDownloaderstring url, string LocationToSave      The method that should be called in the new thread....     right now the compiler is complaining that I dont have the arguments from     the delegate Url and LocationToSave...     the problem is I dont pass URL and LocationToSave here...     static void InitFileDownloader download              backgroundDownload  new Threadnew ThreadStartdownload         backgroundDownload.Start      codepre  pId like to implement this the correct way...so a bit of education on how to make this work would be appreciated.  p

One thing that is frustrating is that allowpush will only take a list of usernames rather than a group.p  pTo that end, I was wondering if itd be possible to use a hook to carry out this task. i.e. by passing in the authenticated username, you could check on demand whether the user has the appropriate access. Thats all fine if you can pass the username into the hook, for examplep  precode[hooks] prechangegroup  echo username codepre  pUnsurprisingly, this always returns the account that IIS is running on.

I have the Enter key working, but Im not sure how I should construct the list or extract the Href from the list etc.. or should I have a second, hidden list which just contains the pure URLp  pHere is the code so far with the relevant section marked p  precodeltscriptgt  var resultslist    function callbackresult      resultslist.show     var items  []     .eachresult, function i, item          items.pushltligtlta hrefviewraw  item.collection    item.classname    item.id  gt  item.Title  ltagtltligt          resultslist.appenditems.join   var listselected var li    .search.eachfunction       this.keyupfunction e          var searchtype  this.attrname         resultslist    searchtype  list         li  resultslist.children         var keycode  e.keyCode         if .inArraykeycode, [37, 38, 39, 40] gt 1              if e.which  40                  if listselected                      listselected.removeClassselected                     next  listselected.next                     if next.length gt 0                          listselected  next.addClassselected                      else                          listselected  li.eq0.addClassselected                                       else                      listselected  li.eq0.addClassselected                               else if e.which  38                  if listselected                      listselected.removeClassselected                     next  listselected.prev                     if next.length gt 0                          listselected  next.addClassselected                      else                          listselected  li.last.addClassselected                                       else                      listselected  li.last.addClassselected                                        else                relevant section              if keycode  13    what to do here                 window.location  listselected.html                            else                  resultslist.empty                 var params                       searchtype searchtype,                         q this.val                                  if this.val                      ajaxThissearchbox, params, callback                                               ltscriptgt codepre
Negative 6525 pI took a 13.3MB image and added it to XCode. Im aware that when compiling, XCode performs some tricks to bring down the file size.

Negative 6525 pI have run into a fairly weird openMP problem.p  pThe task is to take a vector of strings and split each element into its contained kMers all contained substrings of length k. This should parallelize trivially along the elements of the vector, as the kMerification procedure happens independently for each element. I want to store the results in a mapset STL data structure codestdmapltlong long, stdmapltstdstring, stdsetltunsigned intgt gt gt localforReturncode , and I allocate a threadlocal variable for that.p  pThe achieved parallelization behaviour, however, is surprisingly bad  top on linux shows CPU usage of  200, despite running with 40 threads on a 40 core machine. And I have tested that the codeomp criticalcode section is not the bottleneck.p  pMy hunch is that this might be related to false sharing, as the actual data contained in my localized mapset STL classes will end up on the heap. However, I have neither an idea of how to test my intuition, or how to reduce false sharing for STL constructs if this is the problem. I would greatly appreciate any ideasp  pComplete codep  precodeinclude ltstringgt include ltassert.hgt include ltsetgt include ltmapgt include ltvectorgt include ltomp.hgt include ltiostreamgt  int threads  40 int k  31  stdstring generateRandomSequenceint length char randomNucleotide stdvectorltstdstringgt partitionStringIntokMersstdstring str, int k  int mainint argc, char argv[]       generate test data     stdvectorltstdstringgt requiredSEQ     forunsigned int i  0 i lt 10000 i              stdstring seq  generateRandomSequence20000         requiredSEQ.pushbackseq            this variable will contain the final result     stdmapltlong long, stdmapltstdstring, stdmapltunsigned int, intgt gt gt forReturn      ompsetnumthreadsthreads      stdcerr ltlt Data generated, now start parallel processingn ltlt stdflush       split workload ie requiredSEQ according to number of threads     long long maxi  requiredSEQ.size  1     long long chunksize  maxi  threads     pragma omp parallel              assertompgetnumthreads  threads         long long thisThread  ompgetthreadnum         long long firstPair  thisThread  chunksize         long long lastPair  thisThread1  chunksize  1         ifthisThread  threads1 ampamp lastPair lt maxi                      lastPair  maxi                   stdmapltlong long, stdmapltstdstring, stdmapltunsigned int, intgt gt gt localforReturn          forlong long seqI  firstPair seqI lt lastPair seqI                      const stdstringamp SEQsequence  requiredSEQ.atseqI              const stdvectorltstdstringgt kMersInSegment  partitionStringIntokMersSEQsequence, k             forunsigned int kMerI  0 kMerI lt kMersInSegment.size kMerI                              const stdstringamp kMerSeq  kMersInSegment.atkMerI                 localforReturn[seqI][kMerSeq][kMerI]                                   pragma omp critical                      forReturn.insertlocalforReturn.begin, localforReturn.end                    return 0      stdstring generateRandomSequenceint length      stdstring forReturn     forReturn.resizelength     forint i  0 i lt length i              forReturn.ati  randomNucleotide          return forReturn   char randomNucleotide      char nucleotides[4]  A, C, G, T     int n  rand  4     assertn gt 0 ampamp n lt 3     return nucleotides[n]    stdvectorltstdstringgt partitionStringIntokMersstdstring str, int k      stdvectorltstdstringgt forReturn     ifintstr.length gt k              forReturn.resizestr.length  k1          forint i  0 i lt intstr.length  k i                      stdstring kMer  str.substri, k             assertintkMer.length  k             forReturn.ati  kMer                   return forReturn  codepre

Negative 6525 pI have a project that has a splash page that points to two separate sites.

But I dont know exactly how to do this. I have to say that its a shared hosting server, so I can only use htaccess and modrewrite to accomplish this, rightp  pSo, in the webhosts admin interface I pointed www.MySite.tld to the splash folder. Then I put the .htaccess in that folder and rewrite requests to the virtual folder site1 and site2, something like thisp  precodeRewriteEngine on  RewriteCond REQUESTURI site1site2 [NC]  RewriteRule . homeuser1234publichtml1 [L] codepre  pThis doesnt work because, as far as I know, one cant rewrite to files outside the current DOCUMENTROOT splash with modrewrite only. So I tried to point www.MySite.tld one level up to publichtml instead of splash. Now requests to site1 and site2 work for sure but request to  returns a 404 on default because there is no index file in there as you can see in the folder structure above. So I also put the .htaccess one level up in publichtml with the following rules p  precodeRewriteEngine on  RewriteCond REQUESTURI  [NC]  RewriteRule . splash [L] codepre  pNow the splash page is accessable but that appends a splash at the end of the url what I dont wantp  pI have been searching for a solution for many hours and tried many of the suggestions I found so far, but none of these solved my problem. Last thing I tried was to set up some a hrefhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2rewritevhosts.html relnofollowvirtual host with modrewritea, but I couldnt get that to work too. Probably Im just not confirm enough yet with modrewrite and all this other apache stuff. p  pOr maybe I am missing just something fundamental like setting a correct RewriteBase...Can this url  folder structure be accomplished at all with modrewrite only If yes, what rewrite rules do I have to set If not, are there any alternatives I can use Any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 6525 pLets say I want to implement Passive View design pattern. I have a view which contains a listbox which I perhaps will swap with listview or something else in the future. Now, with Passive View one should make the view as dumb as possible. Lets say I want to change the selection. I will put the logic for this in the presenter, thus I add a property to the views interface to get and set SelectedIndex property of the views listbox. But if I in the future want to swap the listbox with a listview I am in trouble, because listview does not have a SelectedIndex property. Do I then implement some logic in the view essentially making it a little less dumb something likep  precodepublic int SelectedIndex      get              if myListView.SelectedIndices.Count gt 0                      return myListView.SelectedIndices[0]                  return 1       codepre  pOr do I put some kind of adapter between the view and the presenter. What would be the most logical approachp

Negative 6525 pIm learning JavaScript by writing a Chrome extension for a website. The website has a section that displays a list of 4 videos, with a button to load more videos. When you click this button, it loads a new list of videos via an AJAX call.p  pI have a function, codegetNextVideocode, which gets the URL of the next video in the list. For example, if you are on the third video, then itll grab the URL for the fourth video. If youre on the fourth video, then itll simulate a click which loads the new list of videos via a function codegetNextVideoListcode and then grab the first in the newly loaded list after a 1s timeout to wait for the DOM to update I tried to use mutation observers but it was too complicated for my skill level.p  precodefunction getNextVideo      if getVideoPosition  4               function ad                      getVideo1                   setTimeoutad, 1000          getNextVideoList          else              var index  getVideoPosition  1         return getVideoindex       codepre  pcodegetVideoPositioncode gets the index of the video in the list using some simple jQuery nthchild selectors. It returns the values code1code, code2code, code3code, or code4code.p  pcodegetVideoncode takes the index of the video 1, 2, 3, or 4 and returns the URL of that video. The returned value looks like this in the console codehttpvideo.example.comvideoidcodep  pMy problem is that when I run codegetNextVideocode on a video that is 4th in the queue, I get codeundefinedcode returned in my console. How do I make the codegetNextVideocode function return the URL of the first video in the list after the AJAX call and subsequent DOM updatep
Negative 6525 pIn our production system SQL Server 2008  R2 there is a table in which generated documents are stored.p  pThe documents have a reference codevarcharcode and a sequencenr codeintcode. The document may be generated multiple times and each iteration gets saved in this table incrementing the sequence number. Additionally each record has a data column codevarbinarycode and a timestamp as well as a user tag.p  pThe only reason to query this table is for auditing purposes later on and during inserts.p  pThe primary key for the table is clustered over the codereferencecode and codesequencenrcode columns.p  pAs you can probably guess generation of documents and thus the data in the table since a document can be generated again at a later time does not grow in order.p  pI realized this after inserts in the table started timing out.p  pThe inserts are performed with a stored procedure. The stored procedure determines the current max codesequencenrcode for the given reference and inserts the new row with the next codesequencenrcode.p  pI am fairly sure a poor choice of clustered index is causing the timeout problems, since records will be inserted for already existing references, only with a different sequencenr and thus may end up anywhere in the record collection, but most likely not at the end.p  pOn to my question would it be better to go for a nonclustered index as primary key or would it be better to introduce an identity column, make it a clustered primary key and keep an index for the combination of reference and codesequencenrcode   p  pKnowing that for the time being and not at all as far as we can foresee there is no need to query this table intensively, except for the case where a new codesequencenrcode must be determined.p  pEdit in answer to questions Tbh, Im not sure about the timeout in the production environment.

Negative 6525 pI have a Windows Store App, currently obfuscated with a hrefhttpwww.preemptive.comproductsdotfuscatoroverview relnofollowDotfuscatora. As of right now, we are not including the public debug symbols in the release package, for fear that they can be used to undermine the obfuscation and possibly assist in reverse engineeringdisassembling our application. Unfortunately, this makes it difficult to deal with crash dumps that MSFT provides us.p  pIs this fear warranted Should we be including the debug symbols What are the implications of leaving the debug symbols inp  pIve attempted to use the unobfuscated public symbols with the crash dumps, but they do not load in Windbg or the Visual Studio Debugger.

Negative 6525 pIm relatively new to WPF and I am trying to make a control where I display data from multiple source objects. The source objects are stored in a collection in my view model and each item has a name and a collection of data objects. Each data object has some properties representing it. The data structure looks something like thisp  pIn the view modelp  precodeObservableCollectionltMySourceObjectTypegt sourceItems get set codepre  pMySourceObjectTypep  precodeSomeType Name get set SomeType Number get set IListltMyDataObjectTypegt get set codepre  pMyDataObjectTypep  precodeSomeType data1 get set SomeType data2 get set SomeType data3 get set codepre  pI want my grid to look something like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5Jd0A.png altSample grid layoutp  pIn addition to that layout, the control needs to support reordering the column groups that correspond to each source object and all rows need to scroll vertically together as if they were all in the same datagrid. The column and group headers also need to be frozen to the top so that they are visible regardless of the scroll position. The individual columns should not be able to be reordered relative to one another and the column groups must always stay together. The source items can be an arbitrarily sized collection so I cant predefine the groups, but the columns within each group are predefined and wont change. p  pCurrently I have this working by using a ListBox with its ItemSource bound to sourceItems. The item template is a dockpanel with a text box for the super header and a datagrid to display the data for each item. I can reorder them with drag and drop with a bunch of event handlers and I synced the scrolling with event handlers as well. The reordering currently is getting a reference to the source collection and reordering that when the drop happens which violates the mvvm.p  pI want to know if there is a better, cleaner way to do this other than using a separate DataGrid for each item. I have played around with having auto generated columns for each item and then the cell template would be another DataGrid. I couldnt figure out how to make it work and doesnt seem any better other than the group reordering being taken care of by the DataGrid itself.p  pMy current thought is that I will have to create a custom control for a GroupedDataGrid or whatever and give it the ability to reorder groups, but Id definitely be interested in an easier way to accomplish the task.p  pMy basic requirements are that it must follow strict MVVM and my main xaml layout can have no code behind. I imagine if the code behind is minimal and purely UI manipulation I can squeak it by, but no code behind is ideal.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 6525 pIm using the css columncount feature to break my section into two columns. On one page, I have an h3 heading at the bottom of the first column and the following p paragraph at the top of the next. Id like to keep the heading with the first few sentences of the paragraph. I can keep it with the entire paragraph by wrapping both in a div styled with inlineblock. This would work with short paragraphs, but not with long ones. I could also arbitrarily break up the paragraph, but I might have to put it back together if additional content was added before the heading forcing it to the next column. I wouldnt be surprised if its not possible as columncount is new.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pBased on a suggestion by Jon below, I tried breakinside from examples I found on the Web now that I knew the key word.p  pCSSp  precode.headingwithtext        webkitcolumnbreakinside avoid    mozcolumnbreakinside avoid    breakinside avoid  codepre  pHTMLp  precodeltsection classheadingwithtextgt     lth3gtBlah, Blahlth3gt         ltpgtwoof, woofltpgt ltsectiongt codepre  pOn an OS X platform, it didnt work at all in Firefox 24.0. In Safari 6.0.5 and Chrome 30.0.1599.66, It moved the heading to the next column so that it was above the text. However, no matter how much text I added to the paragraph, the browsers wouldnt put a break in the paragraph. It worked just like inlineblock. I guess they took avoid to mean avoid at all costs. This approach appears to be correct way. Its just not well supported at this time.p

The problem is that sometimes the LEDs just stay on or off and I have to click the box a few times before it responds again, or reset my circuit...p  pI was trying to do some faultfinding, but couldnt get to the root of the problem is it my app or is it the Arduino codep  pHere are the relevant pieces of my codep  precodeprivate void sendValueint RW, int Pin, int Val send from my app to serial port      if CommPort.IsOpen              CommPort.WriteLineRW.ToString  ,  Pin.ToString  ,   Val.ToString        private void chP9CheckedChangedobject sender, EventArgs e call the sendValue routine      if chP9.Checked                  sendValue1, 9, 255 Write, to pin 9, On          else              sendValue1, 9, 0 Write, to pin 9, Off       codepre  pThis is my C code, it compiles a commadelimited string to send over the serial port to be read by the Arduino.p  pHeres the Arduino codep  precodeint RW    0 to read pin, 1 to write to pin int PN    Pin number to read or write int Val   Value to write to pin  void setup    Serial.begin38400   void loop    ReadIncoming   ProcessIncoming    void ReadIncoming    ifSerial.available gt 0        RW  Serial.parseInt     PN  Serial.parseInt     Val  Serial.parseInt      whileSerial.available gt 0 Clear the buffer if any data remains after reading        Serial.read      void ProcessIncoming    ifRW  0        pinModePN, INPUT      else        pinModePN, OUTPUT     analogWritePN, Val     codepre  pparseInt just takes out the first integer value it finds, stores it and throws away the comma, and does it again and again, but it seems a bit counterintuitive.p  pI think my problem lies herep  precode  whileSerial.available gt 0 Clear the buffer if any data remains after reading        Serial.read    codepre  pI think the App is sending data faster than the Arduino code could handle, especially with this loop, but what do I do with excess datap  pI dont like to use the parseInt, but its the only way I could find to read my instructions correctly.

Negative 6525 pI saw a great speech from Commonswares Mark about multithreading and using wakeful services yesterday at AppsWorld London. He recommends using a hrefhttpsgithub.comcommonsguycwacwakeful relnofollowWakefulIntentServicea or a hrefhttpsdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidsupportv4contentWakefulBroadcastReceiver.html relnofollowWakeFulBroadcastReceivera in some situations to ensure your app will be able to continue some long processing and prevent the device to go to sleep.p  pI have an a hrefhttpsplay.google.comstoreappsdetailsidorg.gpo.greenpower relnofollowappa that does some background processing regularly when the device screen is off. I use a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidappAlarmManager.html relnofollowAlarmManagera to have it get the stuff done regularly. Since I have a large user base 200.000 active users, I get to see all kind of weird cases when users send me some logfile. Among others I could see that on some devices after the alarm will be triggered, the app starts doing his job and then suddenly just doesnt do anything for many seconds, or even minutes no entry in the logfile for a while. I assume this is because the phone goes to sleep. What bugs me is that this happens only on some devices, for instance it would happen a lot on Samsung SGS2, but not on SGS2, SGS3 or SGS4. p  pSo what Im wondering is what is the policy to decide when to put the phone to sleep Is it Android deciding or is it lower at the Linux level How much tweaking from the manufacturer is allowed Shouldnt the sleep policy be part of the a hrefhttpsource.android.comcompatibility relnofollowAndroid Compatibilitya definition Extra question Are there some levels of being asleep, like several levels of CPU speed, or is it just boolean sleeping  not sleepingp

Negative 6525 pI have a camera that needs to orbit locally around an object. This object has an arbitrary rotation, described by a normal vector. Imagine a spherical planet, with a camera looking down at a certain triangle on that planet.p  pMy current implementation is to use the classic vector crossing method to generate a rotation matrix from the triangles normal, then use that matrix as the basis for the standard orbit camera. This works fine near the equator of the planet, but once it gets near the poles, it starts blowing up, with the camera behaving increasingly erratically the closer that it gets to the very center of the pole. p  pIve determined that this is due to the first vector cross, as the two vectors are close to one another in that case  Im not sure what the technical name for the phenomena is. If first vector is 0,1,0, the craziness happens when the normal is close to 0, 1, 0 or 0, 1, 0.p  pIve found quite a few descriptions of this problem, but no working solutions. The closest Ive come was here a hrefhttpxboxforums.create.msdn.comforumsp1327813278.aspx relnofollowhttpxboxforums.create.msdn.comforumsp1327813278.aspxa It mentions that to handle the singularity, use a different vector when it is detected. I can easily determine when the camera is on planet face that will cause this to happen as my planet sphere is generated from 6 quadtrees projected to spherical coordinates, but there is a very noticeable snap when I switch to a new vector.p  pHeres the current codep  precodeVector3 triNormal the current normal of the target vertex Vector3 origin  Vector3.Forward Matrix orientation.Forward  origin  orientation.Up  triNormal orientation.Right  Vector3.Crossorientation.Up, orientation.Forward orientation.Right.Normalize orientation.Forward  Vector3.Crossorientation.Right, orientation.Up orientation.Forward.Normalize codepre  pIve experimented with detecting when triNormal is on one of the pole faces, and setting origin to something else such as Right. The camera then behaves properly once it is on the face, but is immediately snapped to a new rotation as it crosses over. This makes sense, as its reference vector has just changed, but needs to be eliminated for a smooth user experience. I tried figuring out how to offset the cameras yaw for the orbit camera to counteract the new coordinate system, but it doesnt seem to be a constant value, depending on where on the sphere the camera is currently aiming. Im not sure how I could calculate what the difference is.p  pAlso note that as its in XNA and C, Im using a righthand coordinate system.p

Negative 6525 pIn mechanical CAD software which uses concepts similar to autolayout constraints, you can often add a derived constraint.  This has no effect on the layout, but will allow you to directly read the value of an important dimension.p  pFor example, consider the following layout for a view with two subviewsp  precode     32       64      [imgOne][imgTwo]             w codepre  pThe width of the view is the sum of the default edge spacing on the left and right, the default spacing between image views, and the two width constraints 32 and 64 applied to the image views.p  pI would like to know codewcode at runtime.p  pIn theory, this should be codeview.boundscode.  However, its not always safe to read that property as the view may not have updated its layout constraints yet.p  pIs it possible to add a constraint which has no effect on the view size, but which will have its code.constantcode property updated once the layout is completep  pI have tried adding a width constraint to the view with a priority of code1code, but code.constantcode always reads the nominal value, instead of the actual value.p

Negative 6525 pI have a CakePHP application hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Because of the multiple EC2 instances I will use in the future I want to store my PHP sessions in a database. AWS provides a very nice library for storing PHP sessions in their DynamoDB database. See a hrefhttpgoo.glURoi3s relnofollowhttpgoo.glURoi3sap  pNow I putted the AWS SDK in my vendors folder and created an access wrapper for it a pluginp  precodeltphp  Configureloadaws  requireonce VENDORS . autoload.php use AwsCommonAws  class AwsComponent extends Component      private aws      public function construct              thisgtaws  Awsfactoryarray             key    gt ConfigurereadAws.key,             secret gt ConfigurereadAws.secret,             region gt ConfigurereadAws.region                    public function getClientservice              return thisgtawsgtgetservice       codepre  pThe wrapper is working well, I already implemented some S3 stuff. Now for the session handler i added the following code to my AppController.phpp  precodepublic components  arrayAws.Aws  public function beforeFilter      thisgtsetSessionStorage   private function setSessionStorage      client  thisgtAwsgtgetClientdynamodb      clientgtregisterSessionHandlerarray         tablename gt sessions       codepre  pThe AWSs internal registerSessionHandler is executed tested it but the session is not beeing stored into the DynamoDB table. Of course I created the table before and if I add the call to the AWS library directly to my webrootindex.php before dispatcher is loaded everything works fine.p  pI think the problem is that my code is executed after CakePHP calls sessionstart. So what is the best way to implement that a hrefhttpgoo.glkUFUIR relnofollowhttpgoo.glkUFUIRa doesnt help me, I dont want to rewrite the AWS library for beeing compatible with the CakePHP interface.p

Im using IE9 emulation, but that same unresponsiveness happens with IE10 in IE9 mode, and with native IE9, with high CPU usage  but steady memory usage.p  pIn a lighter way, it happens in IE8 too img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9el0X.png altenter image description here But the repainting takes much less time perhaps it repaints smaller parts of the page and the responsiveness isnt compromised.p  pAs you can see, no script is running, just some random garbage collection. In IE10, IE11 and Chrome theres no repaint involved.p  pIf I disable the images did this in IE10, dont know how to do that in IE11, IE9 doesnt keep repainting, embutem if I disable or hide all the images through the style sheets it keeps hogging the CPU. Disabling hardware acceleration makes things even worse, as expected.p  pWhat may cause this odd behaviour in IE9 and partially IE8p

Negative 6525 pI have a small problem in a script I cant solve on my own.

Instead of declaring a variable as global inside a function to be available outside the function, it has to be declared as global outside the function to be available inside the function.  p  pThe Problem is that the value of codeacode is created in codemyfunctacode, so I cant global it before the value is known.br Because of that, I tried to do it like thisp  precode global variable, but no value assigned yet global a  function myfuncta      Do stuff    global a    a  1     return a   function myfunctb      Do other stuff    global a    return a  b  codepre  pThis also didnt work.

And how costly the query would be without a START WITH clause. I have read that in this case, oracle with treat each row as the root row and then connect accordingly. But I wanted to have a better understanding of the use case.p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 6525 pI am looking for a way using programming in Python to extract from a Radius sniffertrace the EAP packetflow, which includes e.g the Server Hello and therfore Server certificate. So far I am using tschark to extract the Radius packet containing EAP Server hello with the fragments already reassembled. I can store this packet in PDML format.

Negative 6525 pIve been searching on this site and all over the internet on how to convert a java program that uses GUI into an applet. Ive found general tutorials, like for basic programs, but mine uses OpenCV a hrefhttpopencv.org relnofollowhttpopencv.orga to generate the image, and then a JFrame makes it into a GUI. Ive managed to put all the code into one class file, so that I could make modifications to it in order to make it run like an applet such as getting rid of the main method and using public void init, then there was the whole process of trying to put it into HTML code, where I tried just straight  tags, and also tried creating a jar file and using that with both  and deployJava.js the java deployment script for applets. I have managed to get nothing to run off of a browser page. All I would need it to do is run as soon as the html page loads, at most from the click of a button but only if necessary. From notfound exceptions to security exceptions to InvocationTargetException. So any help in how I can put this program onlinep  precodeimport java.applet. import java.net.  import java.awt. import javax.swing.  import java.awt.Graphics import java.awt.image.BufferedImage

Negative 6525 pRecently I was working on a nodeJS project and I was thinking how to go about and implement the security module of my mobile application.

We dont have any front end and update database directly using emdbForge Studioem db editor.p  pThe previous developer had designed the table so that the unique id column also serves as sequence number. It also forms part of url. E.g. xxxexercise12 specifically looks for actual 12th row with id12 he assumed all ids are incrementing with 1 and are in sequence in the database rather than row with codeid12code.p  pThe obvious problem with this is when we want to add an exercise to table lets say after emexercise 5em then we add it manually after 5, AND THEN have to manually update the ids for all the following exercises so that they are in sequence. Ideally, we should just add a row in the table and strongemsomehowemstrong explain the php code know that this exercise should appear after emexercise 5em.p  pSimilarly, for example, if we delete an exercise at number 17, then from url codexxxexercise17code the content wont be served. Ideally, id18 is now at spot 17 in sequence, so it has to be served that content.p  pstrongattemptsstrongp  pI have thought of adding another column sequence which will tell in what sequence to serve. But then again I am back to square 1, because Ill have to update the sequence numbers upon adddelete.p  pI have also thought of creating another table and storing id numbers in whatever sequence we want to serve the content.

Negative 6525 pI am getting a software developed for a pick up and delivery service. The business model allows the customer to place order where he can ask to pick up parcels from multiple restaurants and deliver at his doorstep. The operation is such that, when an order is received, a person will be sent from the HUB that is servicing the customers location. From there, the restaurant nearest to the HUB will be visited first and accordingly the other pick up points will be visited considering which is the nearest next and the last visit should be the customers house where the parcels will be delivered and thereafter the delivery boy returns to his HUB. I need to calculate the total distance traversed by the delivery boy, basis which I will charge the customer.p  pThe programme is being developed in PHP. Could you please tell me how to use a GOOGLE API to get this thing done Is there any PHP coding availablep  pRegards, Santanup

This is mostly a performant way to retrieve relations and avoids the codeN1 select issuecode.p  pHowever, its still possible to have the codeN1 select issuecode when a developer mistakenly forgets to do a left join. The relations will still be fetched because the codePersonDTOMappercode will iterate over the codeInvoicescode of a codePersoncode for converting to codeInvoiceDTOscode. So the data is still fetched because the codeDTOMappercode is executed where a Hibernate Session is active managed by codeSpringcodep  pIs there some way to make the codeHibernate Sessioncode not active in our codeDTOMapperscode We would face a codeLazyInitializationExceptioncode that should trigger the developer that he didnt fetch some data like it should.p  pIve read about codeTransactionalpropagation  Propagation.NOTSUPPORTEDcode that suspends the transaction. However, I dont know that it was intended for such purposes.p  pWhat is a clean solution to achieve this Alternatives are also very welcomep

Negative 6525 pWhen a user tabs through the fields they have to tab through a LinkLabel to get to the next field.  I would rather them go straight from field to field without stopping on the LinkLabel.  However, in .NET 3.5 the LinkLabel does not have a TabStop property to set equal to false.  Upgrading to .NET 4.0 or .NET 4.5 is not an option today.p  pIve tried two other possible ways of skipping the LinkLabel that do not work.p  ol lipPut the LinkLabel on a panel and set the TabStop property on the panel to false.  The LinkLabel still gets tabbed to.pli lipProcess the Enter event on the LinkLabel and use SendKeys or some such nonsense to continue to the next control.  This doesnt work because it makes the Click event stop firing.pli ol  pI also considered setting the TabIndex for all LinkLabels on the form to a much higher value than the rest of the controls.  However, that would not work eitherp  pEach field is a TextBox or ComboBox on a panel with a Label.  The ComboBox fields have an additional control on the Panel with them a LinkLabel that says Edit Items.  Each of these Panels are on the main FlowLayoutPanel.  p  pCorrect me if Im wrong.  The way I understand tab order of controls on nested panels is that each Panel would have its own Tab Order.  Then the tab order of each is combined in series based on the TabIndex of each Panel to determine the effective tab order of the controls on the form.  Right  So setting the TabIndex of each LinkLabel to a number in the high 200s would not fix the original problem, the way I see it.p  pHas anyone seen this challenge before  How did you solve it  I feel like I may have to do something drastic like subclass the LinkLabel control.

Negative 6525 pAs preface, I am recreating the barebones of an old game project. It was written in C, and I am doing my best to convert what I had into C. I am also using Visual Studio Professional 2013. In this instance, I had a Coordinate class that could dynamically get and set values to its X and Y properties.

But the more I try to recreate the getset principle established in the C, the more I get confused on whether or not something should go in the .h or the .cpp. Im also pretty noobish when it comes to familiarity with the library and how to use it, so I dont know if theres another way to go about it. None of the exmaples Ive been able to find online come close to having my problem, or answering my question, or are largely too generic or specific to help.p  pThere is a secondary issue of a class called TilePattern that is comprised of a list of Coordinates, but I feel like I will be able to solve that on my own once I figure out this Coordinate issue.p  pSo am I overlooking something really simple Is it a novice mistake Is this just a much more complicated in C Is there a tool in the library that Im unaware of that could fix all of thisp

I could see that Facebook has used SKStoreProductViewController to accomplish this.p  pIf the user installs the app, it seems like the app should open on its own after the download with the correct alapplinkdata, but I never see this happening.  The app never opens on its own its up to the user to open the app on his own.p  pAs far as know applicationopenURLsourceApplicationannotation wont be called until the device registers the custom URL on its first launch.

Negative 6525 pI am new to Cassandra and trying to see if it fits my data query needs. I am populating test data in a table and fetching them using cql client in Golang.p  pI am storing time series data in Cassandra, sorted by timestamp. I store data on a perminute basis.p  pSchema is like thisbr parent    stringbr child     stringbr bytes     intbr val2      intbr timestamp datetimebrp  pI need to answer queries where a timestamp range is provided and a childname is given. The result needs to be the bytes value in that time rangeSingle value, not series I made a primary keychild, timestamp. I followed this approach rather than the columnfamily, comparatortype with timeuuid since that was not supported in cql.p  pSince the data stored in every timestampevery minute is the accumulated value, when I get a range query for time t1 to t2, I need to find the bytes value at t2, bytes value at t1 and subtract the 2 values before returning. This works fine if t1 and t2 actually had entries in the table. If they do not, I need to find those times between t1, t2 that have data and return the difference.p  pOne approach I can think of is to select  from tablename WHERE timestamp lt t2 AND timestamp  t1 and then find the difference between the first and last entry in this array of rows returned. Is this the best way to do it Since MIN and MAX queries are not supported, is there is a way to find the maximum timestamp in the table less than a given value Thanks for your time.p

Is there something equivalent in PHP p  pThe way I am doing it at present is as below  p  p1.loginController.php has the main page and it includes login.phpp  p2.login.php resubmits the data back to loginController.php sorta recursive submitp  p3.Then there is ifthenelse logic to determine whether next redirect needs to go to home.php or just include login.php once again with error messagesp
Negative 6525 pI am trying to make a GUI with one button to connect and accept incoming connections. I like to code the buttons action listener like thisp  precodebutton1.addActionListenernew ActionListener       public void actionPerformedActionEvent evt               try                       socket  serversocket.accept  accepts incoming connections             socket  new Socketip, port   tries to connect if                                             servsock.accept times out         catch Exception e                           codepre  pIf serversocket.accept times out it causes an Exception so the next line is skipped. Must I put them in two different try blocks or is there a better way to do it I cant throw Exceptions here, but if Exceptions emwereem thrown would it allow the code to continue to the next line when an Exception shows upp  pI dont want to code my own exception handler, should i just use two try statementsp

Negative 6525 pIm having problems using a Spring Data Jpa repository inside a Spring Batch tasklet. Id expect to have a valid hibernate transaction in the codeMyOrderTaskletscode codeexecutecode method using the codemyTransactionManagercode that is configured for this step. But as soon as codeflushcode is called or if the execute method is left without explicitly calling codeflushcode. I get a  p  precodeTransactionRequiredExceptionno transaction is in progress. codepre  pWhen debugging I see that a transaction gets created by spring batch before entering the tasklets execute method and that a valid hibernateTransaction is created and put in the codeorg.hibernate.jdbc.JDBCContextcode instance by calling codegetJpaDialect.beginTransactioncode in codeorg.springframework.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManagerdoBegincode.p  pWhen methods of the codeorderRepositorycode are called, I see that the call to codeAbstractPlatformTransactionManagergetTransactioncode finds an existing transaction and calls codehandleExistingTransactioncode. But later on codeorg.hibernate.ejb.AbstractEntityManagerImplisTransactionInProgresscode returns false because no hibernateSession can be found.p  pI see that different Hibernate sessions and codeEntityManagerscode are created for transaction around the tasklets execute method and for the calls to the repository. The outer hibernate transaction which is bound to the outer hibernate session cant be found by the inner hibernate session.p  pAny ideas how to solve this How can the same hibernate session be used for the tasklets execute method and the calls to the repository Can the codehibernateTemplatecode maybe be propagated to other sessions somehowp  pHeres some code extract to show my setupp  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeConfiguration EnableTransactionManagement EnableJpaRepositoriesbasePackageClasses  MyRepositoryConfig.class ComponentScanbasePackageClassesMyRepositoryConfig.class public class MyRepositoryConfig       Autowired     private InfrastructureConfiguration infrastructureConfiguration      Bean     public EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory throws SQLException          LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean factory  new LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean         factory.setJpaVendorAdapterinfrastructureConfiguration.hibernateJpaVendorAdapter         factory.setPackagesToScancom.example.model         factory.setDataSourceinfrastructureConfiguration.dataSource         if StringUtils.hasTextinfrastructureConfiguration.getSchema              factory.getJpaPropertyMap.puthibernate.defaultschema, infrastructureConfiguration.getSchema                  factory.afterPropertiesSet         return factory.getObject           Beanname  transactionManager, myTransactionManager     public PlatformTransactionManager transactionManager throws SQLException          JpaTransactionManager txManager  new JpaTransactionManager         txManager.setEntityManagerFactoryentityManagerFactory         return txManager           Bean     public HibernateExceptionTranslator hibernateExceptionTranslator          return new HibernateExceptionTranslator           Bean     public MyRepositoryService myRepositoryService          return new myRepositoryServiceImpl        Configuration public class DefaultInfrastructureConfiguration implements InfrastructureConfiguration       Valuemy.schemaMYSCHEMA     private String defaultSchema      Valuenovis.jdbc.urljdbcoraclethinexample.comexample     private String jdbcUrl      Valuenovis.jdbc.usernamescott     private String jdbcUsername      Valuenovis.jdbc.passwordtiger     private String jdbcPassword      Valuenovis.jdbc.driverClassNameoracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver     private String jdbcDriverClassName      Valuenovis.hibernate.databaseORACLE     private String hibernateDatabase      Bean     Override     public DataSource dataSource          BasicDataSource ds  new BasicDataSource          ds.setDriverClassNamejdbcDriverClassName         ds.setUrljdbcUrl         ds.setUsernamejdbcUsername         ds.setPasswordjdbcPassword         ds.setTestWhileIdletrue         ds.setValidationQuerySELECT 1 FROM DUAL          return ds           Override     public HibernateJpaVendorAdapter hibernateJpaVendorAdapter          HibernateJpaVendorAdapter vendorAdapter  new HibernateJpaVendorAdapter         vendorAdapter.setGenerateDdlfalse         vendorAdapter.setDatabaseDatabase.valueOfDatabase.class, hibernateDatabase         return vendorAdapter           Override     public String getSchema          return defaultSchema        Configuration ImportMyRepositoryConfig.class public class OrderManagerConfig      Autowired     QualifiermyTransactionManager     private PlatformTransactionManager myTransactionManager      ....

Negative 6525 pI am using a ViewPager to create a UI where the user swipes between pages of grid like cells, each containing a news story. The first page is a Header fragment, it has one much larger cell for the featured story. The rest are Standard fragments and have 12 uniform cells in them. The ViewPager lives in my TabletFragment class this ui is only for tablets, phones use a standard list view, and the only element in that fragments layout is the ViewPager itself. For fragments loaded into the ViewPager, it can be a header or standard fragment as stated above. TabletFragment calls upon Volley to populate a ListArray with news items from a json feed, then it sends that list along to the child fragments header and standard. TabletFragment keeps a list of fragments in the viewPager, and if notifyDataSetChanged is called on the adapter, it then calls a method called loadFragments in all the fragments, so theyll actually load the cells in and draw them to the screen. This is called by the volley response when it is through parsing through it. This model seems correct in my head, and it works for the Header fragment and the FIRST Standard fragment. They draw just like I would expect them to. All subsequent Standard fragments, however, just display blank. The news items arent inserted to the FrameLayouts properly. Before some earlier tinkering, it seemed that all the cells were actually being drawn over top of one another in the first Standard fragment. Changing add to replace fixed that, but I still dont understand why those views were being used when there are other created pages they should be registered to I will include as much code as I can below to help make what Im describing more clear, if there are additional files or methods you would like to see point them out and Ill include them in an update. Any guidance on where Im going wrong would be greatly appreciated, it seems each fragment should be drawing in their own individual cells but this unfortunately isnt the case at the moment.p

Is this correct I had assumed every unique instance of a fragment would have its own unique instances of the views within the layout those are ids for FrameLayouts, these are being loaded into a list by onCreateView when the page is created. Is there another way I should go about this to ensure that the proper, unique identifiers are loaded for each unique pagep

Negative 6525 pI have a block of code that I copied from another site, which is used to parse filter expressions for for a BindingSourceView.

Negative 6525 pI have a site in which jobs are managed by a workflow manager. One type of job is a parent job that spawns children jobs, which are created by adding data to multiple database tables.p  pOne case I am running has 6 parent jobs, in total spawn about 140 sub jobs. If the parent jobs are started sequentially, so one after the other, everything works fine. There are no DB errors and all children jobs get created properly.p  pI am having a problem where if the site is running multiple parent jobs in parallel, the Django commands which save data to the database begin to fail. The script that creates the children jobs uses with transaction.commitmanually with tryexcept statements when writing data to the DB. It records an error count every time a .save operation on one of the model classes happens. As mentioned, when 6 jobs are running in parallel, some of the .save commands begin to fail, which triggers a transaction.rollback so the child jobs never get created.p  pThe process of creating a child job involves writing a few thousand lines to various DB tables.p  pSo the error seems specifically related to when processes are running in parallel. So my question, is what should I look at Djangowise or MySQLwise to figure out why this may happening Im not a MySQL expert by any means, so am not sure where to start.p  pEDIT The problem is that while in parallel mode, the .save command are returning MySQL Deadlock errors. The commands are just adding rows to the table, so not sure whats up..p  pThe total sub job creation process takes about a minute. So, transaction.commitmanually is executed, and throughout the next minute it is trying to add rows.p  pSOLVED It was a deadlocking issue in MySQL. Repeating the transactions until they went through solved the problem.p  pThanks.p

Negative 6525 pI am new to websockets and loadbalancing, but Ill try to explain my constraints and what I tryhave to achieve.p  pWe have a web page that serves a lecture in flash.br On mobile devices, we call an app installed on the device to serve the lecture and once its done, we switch back to the browser for the user to proceed to the next page.br We want that transition to be automatic.p  pThe solution I came up with is to have a websocket clientserver and get a signal from the app to the server that relays to the browser to transit to the next page.br The browser generates a key and connects to the nodejs websocket.io server.br It then fires up the application and provides it the same key.br When the application finishes, it send a get request to the nodejs server that relays through websocket to the browser.p  pIt works already like a charm on our dev server, but in production, we have a load balancer to deal with.p  pMy issues arep  ul liWe dont have access to the loadbalancer.li liWe dont have information about what it is, name or whatever.li liHow can I know that websockets will go throughli ul  pWhat I knowp  ul liThe loadbalancer provides a cookie that tells what client connects to what http server behind.li liWe may have a big number of concurrent clients and dont want to stress the machines their average load is quite high most of the time alreadyli ul  pMy real questions arep  ul liis there a way to simulate such load balancing with a nodejs module for example, say httpproxy I tried for half a day, but I had strange results like creation of infinite sockets from the same opened pageli liif it is possible with httpproxy, any interesting link that could help me find my way Ive followed few tutorial on httpproxy git page already, didnt work as I expectedli liif its not possible, is there a risk that socket.io is not let through the loadbalancer Ive seen we can use xhrpolling settings for example but dontcant really go that wayli liany other possibility to connect a websocket behind a loadbalancer new toys to me, dont really know where to start...li ul  pI thank all helpers in advance, any income is welcome.p

Negative 6525 pI have a plot where three lines are shown. Each line has a marker that identifies its type. The user can choose a type of line and click on the plot to create those lines. No problems this far. p  pThe problem is that i need one of those lines to have two distinct types of markers, for example, the user can right click somewhere on the plot, which will open a context menu and choose one option that would create a point with a special marker for that line. The question is is it possible to mix markers on the same LineSeries If the answer is yes, how can I do thatp  pThank you.p
Negative 6525 pI have an app which uses or googlemaps or openMaps offline depending of connection state. p  pIn each case there are markers, for places or point of interest or I want that the user can display or hide some category of markers.p  pWhen using google maps I have a menu and in the action bar when some item is selected it toggles between showing or hiding the markers from the correpondent category As for google maps that works easily amp perfectly using  codeisVisiblecode p  pAs for osmdroid i have not found in the doc any equivalent to codeisVisiblecode, neither any codeshowcode or codehidecode method. So I have tried to use as a workaround codesomemarkers.getAlphacode amp codesomemarkers.setAlphacode, toggling between code0code amp code1code alpha values. p  pNo error occurs but the visibility of markers remains the same, not toggling, or only randomly when i tap 10 or 20 times on the action icon. p  pIn the log i get codeInputEventReceiver Attempted to finish an input event but the input event receiver has already been disposedcode which seems to me to be the cause. p  pBut what to do to avoid thisp  pKitKat, SonyXperia Zp

Negative 6525 pI have a TVirtualTreeview in my application still D2007 based which sets RootNodeCount to the desired value and in OnInitNode event I assign an Object to the node which is otherwise being stored in a TObjectList in my busines logic class. The object is taken from the business logic class by the Nopdes ID which acts as index into the TObjectList.p  pNow I added sorting capabilities to the VST which for instance meant to add a comparison method to my business logic class which takes the objects attached to the two nodes the OnCompareNodes event gets passed. So far so good, the VST itsself sorts.p  pSince Id like the business logic to have the same sorting as that can print or export data and it should do so in the same way it is being displayed I thought Id use the TObjectLists .exchange method and simply give it the IDs of the two nodes passed to OnCompareNodes.p  pThat fails. The output I get and the debugger supports this is quite different. Im quite puzzled about the possible reasons. of course I could implement sorting of the TObjectList in my business logic class separately and apply this at the end of the OnHeaderClick event, but thats some additional effort Id like to avoid.p  pAny ideas about what I might do wrong or where Im wrongp

Negative 6525 pI want to know if there is a way to test for the empresenceem of AESNI in the host systems CPU from C.NET.p  pLet me say up front that this question is strongnotstrong asking about how to emuseem AESNI from .NET. It turns out simply using codeAESCryptoServiceProvidercode will use AESNI if it is available. This result is based on independent benchmarks I did comparing the performances of codeAESCryptoServiceProvidercode against the benchmarks provided in TrueCrypt, which does indeed support AESNI. The results were surprisingly similar on both machines with and without AESNI.p  pThe reason I want to be able to test for it is to be able to indicate to the emuserem that their computer supports AESNI. This would be relevant since it would reduce support incidents involving questions like but my friend has a Core i5 also but his is a lot faster If the programs user interface could indicate to the user that their system does or does not support AESNI, it would also be possible to indicate that slower performance is normal since this system does not support AESNI.p  pWe can thank Intel for all of the confusion with different processor steppings  p  pIs there a way to detect this information, perhaps through WMIp

Negative 6525 pI need to allow files to be downloaded, but have to track the number of times they were downloaded by each user.p  pI have a simple chunk of code here that allows users to download a file, and then the callback increments the counter in the datastore for that user when its done.p  pThis works fine if a user is NOT using a download manager. But if they are ie DownThemAll then the manager makes multiple HTTP requests and the callback gets called everytime. This spikes the download count and makes it unreliable. Ive tried short circuiting multiple requests by watching a session variable  which in theory would have cut multiple requests down to just one. But it appeared DownThemAll didnt share the same session across requests, so it didnt work.p  pIs there a way to make this workp  precode    return Responsestreamfunction use stream, file, callback          while feofstream              echo freadstream, 1024                  fclosestream         LoginfoResource downloaded, [resource gt file]         if iscallablecallback              calluserfunccallback              , 200, headers codepre

Negative 6525 pThere are several upvoted questions here how to fetch all the remote branches, and the short upvoted answer seems to be that codegit clonecode and codegit fetchcode should do this by default, and that one can see the remote branches by running codegit branch rcode.  However, Im still a bit at short.p  pIve cloned an upstream central repository, and then Ive cloned this clone again.  Say, we have repository A on github, B is a clone of A and C is a clone of B.  The problem is that C contains only branches local at B.  I want to clonepull A  B  C, with C having all the branches of A.p  pIm partly expecting a why would you want to do that in the comments.  I think that given the distributed nature of git, it just ought to be possible.  However, consider bandwidth to be expensive, the repository to be huge, B and C to live on the same filesystem or LAN, and most of the work to be done in branches  in this circumstance its not desirable to clone AB and AC, neither to pull from AB and AC, as it means twice as much network traffic.  There can also be other reasons, i.e. firewalls making direct pull from AC impossible.p

Negative 6525 pI have requirements to let users create their own tables and to create their own forms dynamically inside application. One can image that there can be 3 separate tables userrelations, userrelationfields, userrelationfieldvalues. Together they can satisfy requirements. But apparently such solution is involved, each select requires lot of joins. It is easy to create tables dynamically and it is easy to create CRUD SQL statements dynamically from the set of fields which have been defined by users. I prefer to use annotations instead of configruation XML files, therefor dynamic update of configuration files may not be necessary.p  pThe question is  how to create ORM JPA, Spring Repository mapping to dynamically created tables. Is it possible dynamically create entities and insert them as part of already running application Is it possible to dynamically create code of facelets pages and insert then in application Is it good practice. p  pLot of ERP type applications allow some kind of flexfields or extensibility features so this should be possible.p  pI have heard that Grails is dynamic Java with metaprogramming features maybe it is more appropriate to create such application in Grails especially because it uses Spring and Hibernatep  pAny hints or suggestions are welcome. I guess it should be possible to do but some initial ideas would be helpful. Thanksp

Negative 6525 pDo MySQL unbuffered queries really use no PHP buffering at all And do buffered queries really buffer the whole result set before PHP has access to the datap  pFrom what Ive read about MySQL buffered queries, this isnt what I want because I want to start working on the results right away and not have to wait for all of the results to be buffered before I begin. But from what Ive read about unbuffered queries, this isnt what I want either because I do want it to buffer the results on the client so that MySQL isnt being held up longer than it has to, I just dont want it to wait for the results to be fully buffered before I can begin working on the results. So help me understand.p  pDo buffered queries in MySQLPHP really buffer the whole result set before PHP is allowed to begin using the results And do unbuffered queries really use no buffering at all so that MySQL server is constantly waiting for PHP to request the next result before it is sent to the client If this is true, why isnt there a way to begin using the results immediately and yet still buffer the results to take the load off of MySQLp  pMy MySQL server is a shared server with many different client nodes. So it doesnt make sense to not use buffering on the client side. But the queries are large and so they shouldnt need to wait for the whole result set to be returned to begin using the result.p  pSo do I understand this right Theres no way to do what I want here Theres no way to handle this in a practical wayp

Negative 6525 pThis might actually just be an HTMLJS implementation question, but couldnt find anything about it. Im displaying an unknown number of series, and each series has a unique coloring. However, it seems that I need to hardcode in an array of colors to use for this. For instance, right now Im using the array [red, blue, green, orange] but this means I can only have up to 4 series. I could also do something with the RGB values such as rgb203n... but this makes every 2 colors similar. Is there a way to automatically get a unique color set without hardcoding itp

What I gathered is that you normally dont let a background thread sleep because the system takes care of it.p  pHowever in my case this method seems to be beneficial to me.p  pCan someone elaborate on possible issues with this implementationp  pAny input is appreciated.

Because of this, I am getting errors during cube processing.p  pAdditionally EmployeeNAME is defined as key.p  pstrongWhat I tried so farstrong I added a new attribute EmpID and my plan was to make this attribute key attribute. But when I tried to save the changes I go the error that say something like the corresponding attribute in cube is defined as WCHAR, and the key column in dimension as INTEGER as I mentioned, I tried using EMPID as key column. Then I wanted to check how the dimension connects to cubefact tables. I tried by opening both the cube and the data source view. In both cases, the tableview which the Employee dimension is using is not connected to any other tables  its an island table. I did tried by right clicking on the table and selecting the option Show Related Tables, and no connected table showed.p  pI would appreciate an elegant advice about solving this problem.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Afer following instructions from Jo Douglass, I got the following error message when I tried to save  the changes I am translating from German, so the translation may differ a little from the exact error messagep  blockquote   pDimension Employee cannot be saved because of the following errors   Error in MetadataManager.

Negative 6525 pI have been trying to use serial communication with my Arduino Uno and have used the library jSSC2.6.0.

But If I try and wait till there is some data in the linked list the program just keeps on looping and the SerialEvent never adds bytes to the LinkedList, it even does not even register any bytes being received.p  precode    This works and the correct bytes are sent by Arduino received by SerialEvent and printed to the Console     whiletrue                  t.writebyte 0x41                    But this method just stucks at this.available which returns the size of the LinkedList,  as in no data is actually received from the Arduino or receieved by the serialEvent     public boolean testComm throws SerialPortException             if this.serialPort.isOpened  if port is not open return false                 return false                              this.writeSerialCOM.TEST  SerialCOM.TEST  0x41              whilethis.available lt 1  we wait for a response              if this.read  SerialCOM.SUCCESS                 return true             return false          codepre  pI have debugged the program and sometimes debugging, the program does work but not always. Also the program only gets stuck when i try and check if there is some bytes in the linkedlist i.e whileavailable lt 1. Otherwise if I dont check I eventually receive the correct response of bytes from Arduinop

The base module further uses 56 other modules to handle sub tasks. Each of these modules need to make queries to the DB.

Or should I get a connection from the pool in the base module and pass the same connection around. Or if there is a better way to share a common mysql connection pool across modules in nodejsp

Negative 6525 pI have a demo to create which needs to have 3 different log on types. I am not very familiar with PHP and have been using the google app engine with endpoints quite recently. p  pI am looking to have a simple log on system with a user name and password and i have set up 3 different entity types admin, merchant and store manager.p  pThe only problem is that all the objectify queries that are created need to be pre defined and cannot search for a user with a username and password matching the correct one specified on the index page which means i cant retrieve the data from the datastore using the APIs unless i filter it before had which wont work for a log on system. p
Negative 6525 pI have never done this before so I am asking for the best way how to do it. p  pI have mysql table this one is for simplification, honestly I have 3 tables and I make joins between them p  blockquote   pID, PRICE, TYPE, TIMEMILLISp blockquote  ptime when inserted to dbp  pNow I would like to produce graphs with structured data, so if I want to produce monthly graph I need data ordered by months JanDec, if daily 131. So I think data should be somehow grouped. And then I should be able to select between TYPEs as well. p  pI tried simple select for all data from db in preferred date range and then to group it with php foreach cycle but I think this is not optimal for a lot of lines in db up to 1 000 000 and it is not computing power effective.p  pI just need to find best way how to write mysql select for this not the right javascript graph engine.p

Negative 6525 pIm trying to populate a TreeView component in VB.NET from a XML file. Its a large XML file and I chopped it up in order to give you guys an idea about how it is structured. Im new to VB.NET so Im having a hard time to figure this out. Below theres an image of the order I expect this data to be shown in the TreeView, and I added some arrows so you can understand where the data is supposed to come from in the XML structure.p  pI found and tried to adapt a code I got from a Microsoft tutorial, but its based on a much simpler XML structure and its not working with my file.p  pThe arrows in the image are being shown out of synch with the XML tags amp nodes but my goal was to avoid the arrows and rectangles overlaping each other making the picture unreadable.p  pWhen we have a node named Cutter its a different type of component, and more than one may be comprised within the current Cutter or Holder node, so they are separated by the Reference tag. If its named Holder its another component type on the tool stackup... Every new tool starts with an element named Tool. p  pBelow the picture what Im trying to do in the codep  pa hrefhttpwww.screencast.comtucr4Z4a77L7 relnofollowTree View Explanationap  precodePrivate Sub btnSearchTLSClicksender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles btnSearchTLS.Click          Try              SECTION 1.

Negative 6525 pstrong6.30.15  HOW CAN I MAKE THIS QUESTION BETTER AND MORE HELPFUL TO OTHERS FEEDBACK WOULD BE HELPFUL. THANKSstrongp  pI have a dgrid connected to a store with a very large data set. Currently over 137,000 rows. I expect there to be a delay. When I first connected the store  the data populated the dgrid. However I keep getting a pipe break now. I didnt change anything between it working and not working. Currently this is running on a virtual machine. I have three separate clone testing environments, all virtual machines. And I get the same issue with all of them pipe break.  I created the clones BEFORE they started breaking in each one. I get an errno 32 broken pipe message or nothing  it just keeps trying to load but not. p  pI am using FireFox, Dojo 1.10  OnDemandGrid. Does the same thing in Google.p  pWhen the dgrid WAS working I had some issues with it locking up the browser every time I tried to scroll using the scroll bar or if I did a search on the data. p  pAny recommendations I can give more information if needed.p  pADDED NOTE I have also tried Grid and Pagination  and doing smaller amounts of data. I consistently get a broken pipe message now. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfP9kN.png altenter image description herep  pNow Im getting this endless GET request in the browser when trying to load data. p

Negative 6525 pThe intro is a bit tedious, but is just for clearity Some might even learn something from it or get some handy insights. My question is found at the bottom. I really hope someone can help mep  pI have this interfacep  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic interface IEFEntity      object GetPKValue     bool PKHasNoValue  codepre  pAll my automatic genereted EF classes implement this interface and implement the 2 methods. This is done via a separate file using partial classes so the implementation is not gone when regenerating the EF classes. This is not important for the question but I have put an example of the setup of two EF classes, codedebiteurcode and codeschakelingcode below.

Negative 6525 pI have a problem with my pygame display. I am making it the same size as my screens dimension, so when I fullscreen it there will be no black borders around the edges. I am using currentw and currenth before generating a pygame display to do this. But when I run the game the display is to big and I cant see it all in fullscreen. It is not a problem with the fullscreen though, if I turn fullscreen off the window is too large and cant fit onto my screen. I have printed out the results of currentw and currenth, getting 1920 and 1080, which are the right numbers, my computer screen resolution being those numbers. The problem doesnt seem to be with the fullscreen or the resolution, so I have no idea what is wrong.p  pSo to sum my problem upp  ul liI want a pygame display with the same size as my screen resolutionli liThe display is to large, unable to fit onto my screenli liDespite this, the displays dimensions match up with those of my screen resolutionli ul  pAny help will be greatly appreciated, thanksp  pThe code I am using to get my screen size and create the display arep  precodeinfoObject  pygame.display.Info display  pygame.display.setmodeinfoObject.currentw, infoObject.currenth codepre  pI have tried fullscreen, as I mentioned previously, like thisp  precodedisplay  pygame.display.setmodeinfoObject.currentw,inforObject.currenth,pygame.FULLSCREEN codepre

Negative 6525 pIm working on my footer and I have some contact info floating to the right and the text is aligned right. p  pBelow that I wanted to put social media links. I wanted Follow me at then icons for Facebook and Instagram. I gave these icons as well as others in my footer the class icon. In my css I targeted them and gave them color, pseudo classes, size, etc. For some unknown reason, the first icon isnt being targeted. I even copied and pasted the code for the second over the first one and its still no targeted. Is there a rule Im missing I havent messed with spans much, so I may be screwing that up.

Negative 6525 pI have an hform in my page and have another page embedded using uiinsert. Im using foundation 5 and my page has a modal. Now this modal opens as I click a button on the page. I fill the content in this modal and the values dont go across to the bean session scoped cdi unless I add hform there in the modal. I understand this isnt valid in html, but I couldnt avoid doing this. So far no problems. Until now when I try to complete an action on the modal, after the action completes, it is supposed to close conditionallyif a certain list becomes empty. so I added a function in the onevent of ajax request, which closes the modal if data.status  success, checks for list empty condition and escapes to the main page and clicks a tab as it should from the javascript. The problem is, the model values get updated, even the form components I render using render attribute of fajax, are updated, meaning displaynone is applied to my buttons style, but the button remains on the page. This button is supposed to disappear, but it does not until I refresh the page. Also there are other components on the page which are supposed to disappear but dont until I click the button or refresh the page.p  pOne other scenario is that as I finish a save function from this modal from a button, it escapes to the main page and updates a list and other components on the page, on my local server. But when I commited this code to remote serverdevint env, things on the main page become unresponsive and freeze until a manual page refresh. No code difference between local and server.p  pTried clearing browser cache,p  ul li  li ul  pBut no use. I forced a form submit and button click through the javascript, which I shouldnt have to do, the form submit does it but I also do a click on a tab after that and that does not work.p  pI have looked for some solution on the web extensively but I cant seem to find any related post. Dont know what I am not doing. Any help will be much appreciated because right now Im superstuck here. p
