Positive 1136 pI have a Java Eclipse RCP program in which I have a a long string inside a JFace combobox. Now when I am in the same view,The combobox attaches a scroll over it to show the full name. but as soon as I re size the window of the application, the combobox stretches itself to accommodate the lengthy string. p  pHow do i make the combobox stay the same size. Like the size of it should remain fixed even after I resize the window. Here are two screen shots to demonstrate the issue. p  pP.S.

Positive 1136 pI tried the two sets of example code in p  pa hrefhttpwww.eclipse.orgarticlesarticle.phpfileArticleUnderstandingLayoutsindex.html relnofollowhttpwww.eclipse.orgarticlesarticle.phpfileArticleUnderstandingLayoutsindex.htmlap  pthat uses first GridLayout and then FormLayout to display the dog show entry   window. I put each one into a Part in parallel Part Sash Containers.  When I shrink the window to resize it, the GridLayout implementation preserves the location of widgets and they become no longer visible as the window shrinks   which intuitively seems right    whereas the FormLayout implementation seemingly renders some widgets overlapping others to fit them into the smaller window space. p  pI noticed the same effect in another FormLayout part that I tried.    p

Positive 1136 pyet a new Eclipse Scout question from mep  pIn my Scout Application which is roughly based on the template Outline Tree and Table Form I managed to add new instances of a searchform with a click on a node. My forms display properties are configured like thisp  precode  Override   protected int getConfiguredDisplayHint  return DISPLAYHINTVIEW        Override   protected String getConfiguredDisplayViewId  return VIEWIDPAGEDETAIL  codepre  pIm not adding the forms to pages with the builtin methodse.g. setDetailFormIForm form, but I set them as a new attribute to the pages and start them via their FormHandler. In this way I achieve that the Scout renderer tabs the forms next to each other and this is exactly what I want. Adding them as forms to the page causes the renderer to close the other forms whenever a page is activated, so only one form is displayed at one time.p  pMy problems with this implementation arep  ol liReactivation of the tabs is only possible in the RAP client. For the RAP client it is enough to call the activate method of the form to reactivate and focus the corresponding tab.  On the other hand the SWT client which I depend on doesnt seem to care at all about the activate call and therefore does not reactivate the page. So Im searching for a safe and easy way to persuade the SWT renderer of    ol litabbing the forms next to each other preferably without the use of a Scout TabField. As described above, this is already working, but Im not sure if this is the recommended way.li lireactivate the tabs on a NodeClick as the RAP client already doesli olli liReceive events when clicking on the tab closing the tab Xbutton in SWT, no button in RAP ., or whatever. I think this question is bit broader as it is a general problem in Scout to step into productspecific processes which are not part of the abstract programming model of Scout. Nevertheless, it would be nice to process those event and others out of the global client without tweaking the specific rendering products.li ol  hr  pA screenshot of my programs UI to make things easier to follow a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.commw0Ed.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commw0Ed.png altScreenshot of the Scout applicationap  pIn the screenshot the fifth form is activated as a view and the corresponding node in the outline tree on the left is also marked. As you see, there are multiple forms added which all belong to a node in the outline tree. When I click a node in the tree, I want the corresponding form to be activated and focuse if it hasnt been openend before. Apart from that the tabs should stay the same. I dont want to reinitialize the forms that already exist.p  hr  pIm using Scout Version 5.0p

Is there any solutionp  pEDIT So if there is not solution to the EVAL problem, how else can it be donep  pEDIT There was a question about what exactly I am try to do.  I am writing a compiler.  I want to accept an sexpression with variables closed in the lexical environment where the expression is defined.  It may indeed be better to write it as a macro.p
Negative 1136 pWe are in the process of porting a legacy system to .NET, both to clean up architecture but also to take advantage of lots of new possibilities that just arent easily done in the legacy system.p  pstrongNote When reading my post before submitting it I notice that I may have described things a bit too fast in places, ie. glossed over details. If there is anything that is unclear, leave a comment not an answer and Ill augment as much as possiblestrongp  pThe legacy system uses a database, and 100 custom written SQL all over the place. This has lead to wide tables ie. many columns, since code that needs data only retrieves what is necessary for the job.p  pAs part of the port, we introduced an ORM layer which we can use, in addition to custom SQL. The ORM we chose is DevExpress XPO, and one of the emfeaturesem of this has also lead to some problems for us, namely that when we define a ORM class for, say, the Employee table, we have to add properties for all the columns, otherwise it wont retrieve them for us.p  pThis also means that when we retrieve an Employee, we get all the columns, even if we only need a few.p  pOne nice thing about having the ORM is that we can put some propertyrelated logic into the same classes, without having to duplicate it all over the place. For instance, the simple expression to combine first, middle and last name into a display name can be put down there, as an example.p  pHowever, if we write SQL code somewhere, either in a DALlike construct or, well, wherever, we need to duplicate this expression. This feels wrong and looks like a recipe for bugs and maintenance nightmare.p  pHowever, since we have two choicesp  ul liORM, fetches everything, can have logic written onceli liSQL, fetches what we need, need to duplicate logicli ul  pThen we came up with an alternative. Since the ORM objects are codegenerated from a dictionary, we decided to generate a set of dumb classes as well. These will have the same number of properties, but wont be tied to the ORM in the same manner. Additionally we added interfaces for all of the objects, also generated, and made both the ORM and the dum objects implement this interface.p  pThis allowed us to move some of this logic out into extension methods tied to the interface. Since the dumb objects carry enough information for us to plug them into our SQLclasses and instead of getting a DataTable back, we can get a List back, with logic available, this looks to be working.p  pHowever, this has lead to another issue. If I want to write a piece of code that only displays or processes employees in the context that I need to know who they are ie. their identifier in the system, as well as their name first, middle and last, if I use this dumb object, I have no guarantee by the compiler that the code that calls me is really providing all this stuff.p  pOne emsolutionem is for us to make the object know which properties have been assigned values, and an attempt to read an unassigned property crashes with an exception. This gives us an opportunity at runtime to catch contract breaches where code is not passing along enough information.p  pThis also looks clunky to us.p  pSo basically what I want advice on is if anyone else has been in, or are in, this situation and any tips or advice you can give.p  pWe can not, at the present time, break up the tables. The legacy application will still have to exist for a number of years due to the size of the port, and the .NET code is not a in3yearsrelease type of project but will be phased in in releases along the way. As such, both the legacy system and the .NET code need to work with the same tables.p  pWe are also aware that this is not an ideal solution so please refrain from advice like you shouldnt have done it like this. We are well aware of this p  phr p  pOne thing weve looked into is to create an XML file, or similar, with contracts. So we could put into this XML file something like thisp  ul liThere is an Employee class with these 50 propertiesli liAdditionally, we have these 7 variations, for various parts of the programli liAdditionally, we have these 10 pieces of logic, that each require property X, Y and Z X, Y and Z varies between those 10li ul  pThis could allow us to codegenerate those 8 classes full class  7 smaller variations, and have the generator detect that for variation 3, property X, Y and K is present, and I can then tie in either the code for the logic or the interfaces the logic needs into this class automagically. This would allow us to have a number of different types of employee classes, with varying degrees of property coverage, and have the generator automatically add all logic that would be supported by this class to it.p  pMy code could then say that I need an employee of type IEmployeeWithAddressAndPhoneNumbers.p  pThis too looks clunky.p

Negative 1136 pI am in the middle of solving a problem where I think its best suited for a decorator and a state pattern. The high level setting is something like a sandwich maker and dispenser, where I have a set amount of ingredients and a few different types of sadnwiches i can make. Each ingedient has a cost associated with it. The client would be someone who will use the machine to select ingredients to make a particular swndwich and the machine would dispense it.p  pSo far I have created the ingredients and the different types of sandwiches using the decorator patternp  precodepublic abstract class Sandwich      String description  Unknown Sandwich      public String getDescription     return description           public double cost     return 0.0       codepre  pEach ingredient is modeled this thisp  precodepublic abstract class Ingredient extends Sandwich      public abstract String getDescription  codepre  pAnd further more, a concrete ingredient would bep  precodepublic class Cheese extends Ingredient      private Sandwich sandwich      public CheeseSandwich sandwich     this.sandwich  sandwich           public String getDescription      return sandwich.getDescription  , cheese           public double cost      return 0.25  sandwich.cost       codepre  pA specific type of a sandwich can be modeled like thisp  precodepublic class BLT extends Sandwich      public BLT     description  Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato       codepre  pSo a client would create a specific sandwich like thisp  precodeSandwich orderablt  new Tomatonew Lettucenew Baconnew Breadnew BLT codepre  pAs a next step I will create a Dispenser object which will act as an automatic machine, which is preloaded with a specific number of ingredients which are measured in generic units and a user can press a button to choose one of the preset selectionsp  pFor example p  ul liBLT 1 unit of tomato, 1 unit of lettuce, 1 unit bacon, 1 unit breadli liSUB 1 unit meatballs, 1 unit cheese, 1 unit italiansauce, 1 unit breadli lietc..li ul  pMy Dispenser machine will come preloaded with a fixed number of units per ingredientp  ul litomato 10li lilettuce 10li libacon 10li lietc..li ul  pAnd a list of buttons for the user to select a specific kind of sandwichp  ul li1BLTli li2SUBli li3BBQli li..etcli ul  pThe idea is to keep track of the internal capacity of ingredients and be able to tell the user that, say, we dont have enough bacon left to make another BLTp  pNow, my initial thought is do create the Dispenser object based on the state design pattern, but I have hit a problem trying to combine the objects of the Ingredient class with some kind of a storage within the Dispenser class. At first I though a map with namevalue pairs the ingredient typeingredient quantity. But I am not sure how to combine those patterns together so I can decrement automatically after every use.p  pDo you perhaps have a general idea on how to go ahead and implement such a concept First of all am I on the right track with decorator and state patterns Would there be a more efficient approach I hope I have explained the problem clearly.p  pThank you for any direction, I appreciate any thoughtsp
Negative 1136 pIm designing a shopping cart. To circumvent the problem of old invoices showing inaccurate pricing after a products price gets changed, I moved the price field from the Product table into a ProductPrice table that consists of 3 fields, pid, date and price. pid and date form the primary key for the table. Heres an example of what the table looks likep  precodepid    date     price 1      1109   50 1      2109   55 1      3109   54 codepre  pUsing codeSELECTcode and codeGROUP BYcode to find the latest price of each product, I came up withp  precodeSELECT pid, price, maxdate FROM ProductPrice GROUP BY pid codepre  pThe date and pid returned were accurate. I received exactly 1 entry for every unique pid and the date that accompanied it was the latest date for that pid. However, what came as a surprise was the price returned. It returned the price of the first row matching the pid, which in this case was 50.p  pAfter reworking my statement, I came up with thisp  precodeSELECT pp.pid, pp.price, pp.date FROM ProductPrice AS pp INNER JOIN      SELECT pid AS lastPid, maxdate AS lastDate FROM ProductPrice GROUP BY pid  AS m ON pp.pid  lastPid AND pp.date  lastDate codepre  pWhile the reworked statement now yields the correct price54, it seems incredible that such a simple sounding query would require an inner join to execute. My question is, is my second statement the easiest way to accomplish what I need to do Or am I missing something here Thanks in advancep  pJamesp

Negative 1136 pId like to know how delayed commit functionality works on CI servers that are not integrated with the source control repositories. Conceptually, the process works like follows   p  ol liCheck in code changesli liCI server builds the changesli liIf the build passes, the code is committed to source control repositoryli liIf the build fails, the code is not committed to the source control repositoryli ol  pMost CI servers work by polling the source control repositories for changes and then pulling down the code. So in the delayed commit scenario, are developers checking their code into the CI server rather than an actual source control repositories and then the CI server is passing on the code to the repository Or alternatively are the CI servers just rolling back changes if the build failsp  pIm thinking of two continuous integration systems in particular. Team Foundation Server is going to offer this functionality in the next version, but it makes sense because the Team Build CI system within TFS is integrated with the source control repository. However, in the case of Team City, TC is able to connect to any source control system and is not necessarily integrated with or even on the same server as the source control repository.

Negative 1136 pIn the last month, weve had a persistent problem with the Python 2.6.x multiprocessing package when weve tried to use it to share a queue among several different linux computers.  Ive posed this question directly to Jesse Noller as well since we havent yet found anything that elucidates the issue on StackOverflow, Python docs, source code or elsewhere online.p  pOur team of engineers hasnt been able to solve this one, and weve posed the question to quite a few people in python user groups to no avail. I was hoping someone could shed some insight, since I feel like were doing something incorrect but are too close to the problem to see it for what it is. p  pHeres the symptomp  precodeTraceback most recent call last   File vardjangorootdevcombrightscopedataprocessesdaemonsdeferredupdatesserversqueueserver.py, line 65, in getfromqueue     return queue, queue.getblockFalse   File ltstringgt, line 2, in get   File usrlocallibpython2.6multiprocessingmanagers.py, line 725, in callmethod     conn.sendself.id, methodname, args, kwds IOError [Errno 32] Broken pipe codepre  pIm showing where our code calls queue.get on a shared queue object, hosted by a manager that extends SyncManger.p  pWhats peculiar about the issue is that if we connect to this shared queue on a single machine lets call this codemachine Acode, even from lots of concurrent processes, we never seem to run into an issue. Its only when we connect to the queue again, using a class that extends multiprocessing SyncManager and currently adds no additional functionality from other machines lets call these codemachines B and Ccode and run a high volume of items into and out of the queue at the same time that we experience a problem.p  pIt is as though pythons multiprocessing package handles local connections even though they are still using the same manager.connect connection method in a manner that works from codemachine Acode but when remote connections are made simultaneously from at least one of codemachines B or Ccode we get a Broken pipe error.p  pIn all the reading my team has done, we thought the problem was related to locking.  We thought maybe we shouldnt use codeQueue.Queuecode, but instead codemultiprocessing.Queuecode, but we switched and the problem persisted we also noticed that SyncManagers own shared Queue is an instance of Queue.Queue.  p  pWe are pulling our hair out about how to even debug the issue, since its hard to reproduce but does happen fairly frequently many times per day if we are inserting and .geting lots of items from the queue.  p  pThe method we created codegetfromqueuecode attempts to retry acquiring the item from a queue 10 times with randomized sleep intervals, but it seems like if it fails once, it will fail all ten times which lead me to believe that .register and .connecting to a manager perhaps doesnt give another socket connection to the server, but I couldnt confirm this either by reading the docs or looking at the Python internal source code.p  pCan anyone provide any insight into where we might look or how we might track whats actually happening p  pHow can we start a new connection in the event of a broken pipe using codemultiprocessing.BaseManagercode or codemultiprocessing.SyncManagercode p  pHow can we prevent the broken pipe in the first placep

Negative 1136 pThe scenario is that I have a UIViewController containing multiple InteractiveUIImageViews inherited from UIImageView each containing their own UIImage. In InteractiveUIImageView I have iplemented methods for touchesBegan, touchesMoved and touchesEnded to handle their movement and behaviour on screen. Certain objects of this type will be set as containers think recycle bin with the objective being that when one image is dragged onto it, it will be removed from the screen and placed inside it to be potentially retrieved later.p  pMy current thinking would be to call a new method in UIViewController from the touchesEnded method of my InteractiveUIImageView but being new to all this Im not really sure how to go about doing that e.g. calling a method from the parent or indeed if this is the best way to achieve what I want to do.p  pThanks in advance for any advice.p

The byte array is guaranteed to be relatively small, between a few bytes up to a max of 1800 bytes. The array is read exactly once completely between each call to the read method. There is no need for any error checking in getBits, such as exceeding the array etc.p  hr  pIt seems my initial question above isnt clear enough. A bit sequence of N bits forms an integer of N bits, and I need to extract those integers with minimal overhead. I have no use for strings, as the values are either used as lookup indices or are directly fed into some computation. So basically, the skeleton shown above is a real class and getBits signature shows how the rest of the code interacts with it.p  hr  pExtendet the example code into a microbenchmark, included blitzpastas solution fixed missing byte masking. On my old AMD box it turns out as 11400ms vs 38000ms. FYI Its the divide and modulo operations that kill the performance. If you replace b8b with b3b and b8b with bamp7B, both solutions are pretty close to each other jdk1.7.0ea104.p  hr  pThere seemed to be a bit confusion about how and what to work on. The first, original post of the example code included a read method to indicate where and when the byte buffer was filled. This got lost when the code was turned into the microbench. I reintroduced it to make this a little clearer. The idea is to beat all existing versions by adding another subclass of BitArray which need to implement getBits and prepareBitGet, the latter may be empty. bDo not change the benchmarking to give your solution an advantage, the same could be done for all the existing solutions, making this a completely moot optimization reallybp  pI added a Version0, which does nothing but increment the bitGet state. It always returns 0 to get a rough idea how big the benchmark overhead is. Its only there for comparison.p  pAlso, an adaption on MSNs idea was added Version3. To keep things fair and comparable for all competitors, the byte array filling is now part of the benchmark, as well as a preparatory step see above. Originally MSNs solution did not do so well, there was lots of overhead in preparing the int[] buffer. I took the liberty of optimizing the step a little, which turned it into a fierce competitor  You might also find that I deconvoluted your code a little. Your getBit could be condensed into a 3liner, probably shaving off one or two percent. I deliberately did this to keep the code readable and because the other versions arent as condensed as possible either again for readability.p  hr  pbConclusionb code example above update to include versions based on all applicable contributions. On my old AMD box Sun JRE 1.6.021, they come out asp  pV0 no implementaion took b5384b msbr V1 Durandals original took b10283b msbr V2 blitzpastas adapted took b12212b msbr V3 MSNs posted took b11030b msbr V4 MSNs halfbuffer modification took b9700b msp  pNotes In this benchmark an average of 7.5 bits is fetched per call to getBits, and each bit is only read once. Since V3V4 have to pay a high initialization cost, they tend to show better runtime behavior with more, shorter fetches and consequently worse the closer to the maximum of 16 the average fetch size gets. Still, V4 stays slightly ahead of all others in emallem scenarios. In an actual application, the cache contention must be taken into account, since the extra space needed for V3v4 may increase cache misses to a point where V0 would be a better choice. If the array is to be traversed more than once, V4 should be favored, since it fetches faster than every other and the costly initialization is amortized after the fist pass.p

Once it was in datatable it worked flawlessy.p  pNow has come the time to bind a standard Dropdownbox to 1 field of a collection IList of Products but it appears i am having issues again.p  pSo this has brought me to the conclusion that i must be doing something wrongp  pI cant believe that it isnt possible to BIND ASP.NET controls to a collection IList of a class in my case products that is returned from NHibernate.p  pI would really appreciate any feedback anyone has on the situation... I am at a lossp  pThank youp

I cannot store the mementos in memory because I dont have enough memory so I write the mementos to disk instead. This works fantastic except for the above pausing problem as it means the UI is forced to wait for the IO to finish and 1.5s of lag is too much to hide from the user. I know there are other was to implement undoredo but every approach has flaws.p

Negative 1136 pIm helping a friend build a dictionaryofsorts for a project hes working on. Part of the project is to create a Search functionality. The database is in MySQL, backend in php.p  pNow, running our simple query was a piece of cakep  precode SELECT ,              CASE WHEN word LIKE query THEN 1 ELSE 0 END          CASE WHEN defin LIKE query THEN 1 ELSE 0 END      AS relev     FROM dictionary     WHERE word LIKE q     OR defin LIKE q     ORDER BY relev DESC codepre  pIt produced good results for example, inputting fire gave us fire, firemen, firetruck, on fire, etc. However, we also want room for error We want the mistake prnk to give us prank, prink and also pink, or the word mule to also suggest the word mole.p  pQuite surprisingly, we werent able to find any information on it. The relevence system is entirely superficial because we dont need actual relevence just an overall pointer, but we do need something and thats why we went for the LIKE statement and not the MATCH...AGAINST statement, where we found nowhere to sort by relevence.p  pThe database only consists of three things id, word, defin. Simple as that, as that was the required complexity or simplicity.p  pThanks to anyone in advance.p

Negative 1136 pSay I have a graph network of nodes, with weightings on the following 1. travelling one way on a link between two nodes. 2. travelling the other way on a link between two nodes these might be different. 3. changing from one link to another.p  pAlso, some of the nodes are oneway only.p  pIn this case, what would be the best algorithms for a finding a minimum spanning tree b finding the shortest route between two nodes c finding the travelling salesman path i.e. the shortest route that goes everywhere, with minimum duplicationp  pAlso, would it be best to treat the bidirectional thing as two singledirectional paths, rather than a bidirectional path with different weightings in each directionp  pan examplep  precode              3   A lt23gt B lt32gt C    1        23                 14       43                 3         4 8 D lt35gt E   2    1 31         F codepre  pWhere lt23 means weight of 2 travelling left and 3 travelling right. 14 means 1 travelling up and 4 travelling down.

The cost on the edge is the journey time on a train between two stations, and the costs on the nodes are how long the interchange time is which may vary between edges even at the same node, depending on how far away the platform is, how regular the service is, etc.p

Negative 1136 pThis is what I have to do p  pTo build a CADlike application that loads a point cloud i.e. thousands of 3D points representing a 3D object from file, allows the users to manipulate the points i.e. change the shape by moving the points, do a lot of calculations the points on the points e.g. finding the intersection points between lines and surfaces, detect a point is above or under a surface etc., measure the distances between points, or points to surface etc., and then save the modified points to file.p  pIt also provides basic CADlike UI features such as zoom inout, pan the view, rotation the camera etc.p  pSpeed is the major concern.p  pInstead of writing my own functions for matrix operation and defining my own pointlinesurface classes, I would like to use existing librariesAPIs to do the job.p  pI know WPF, XNA and SlimDX provides the API to do 3D geometric calculations and all of them are finally calling DirectX, but Im just newbie to all of them. Im wonderingp  ol lipWhich one or some other suggestion could give better performance in speed.pli lipMy understanding about DirectXs 3D functions is that it mainly deals with gaming graphics  screen outputs, is it also suitable for datalevel calculationsi.e. use the 3D functions to manipulate the point data, calculate the distances etc., but not outputting it on the screen By suitable, I mean if I create thousands of DirectX vertexes and mainpulate them, would it be much slower than using my own data types and structures Pls correct me if my understanding is wrong.pli lipIf I use WPF, do I need to use XNA as well Im kind of mixing up these two things.pli lipThe application is supposed to run in research labs PC which doesnt have powerful gaming display card, so does it mean XNA is not preferredpli lipAn suggestion about the technologies should be used for this applicationpli ol  pThanksp  pupdatep  pTo make it clearer, the app will load 108,000 points in 3D, and every points will form surfaces with other adjacent points, so roughly the the same number of 3D surfaces are involved Im not generating them at the same time. I will do a lot of 3D geometric and matrix calculations with the point and surfaces, such as intersection, interpolation, transformation etc. , so the speed of the calculations is my major concern. Most of the time I will only draw the final result to the screen and the drawing is mainly lines and points, the speed of drawing is not a big concern . so it is not really a graphicintensive app, but a geometriccalculationintensive app. p  pAfter reading the answer and comments, I think of two options p  ol lipstore amp calculate the data with primitive datatypes, and convert data to the WPFXNASlimDX data structures when drawing them on screen, or pli lipuse these APIs data structures to store, calculation and drawing all those points.pli ol  pwhich one is betterp

Negative 1136 pIs it possible with reflection to create a dynamic IF statementp  pI have seen examples with BeanShell like this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2838801dynamicifstatementevaluationproblemwithstringcomparisonDynamic if statement evaluation problem with string comparisona but i would like to know if it was possible to do it without BeanShell, and be pointed to some examples to adapt to my needs.p  pBasically i have a statement of the form A operator B.p  pA and B can be numbers Doubles or ints or strings, but always A is the same type as B. operator can be , , , , lt ,lt, and even others which behavior may be defined trough a class of their own, another reason why i will use reflection, since i can take that string and use reflection to invoke the appropriate method.p  pI want must to avoid branching if and switch because the variations are too many and will change constantly with user generated input.p
Negative 1136 pAll is in the title. I try to create my own OpenGL font system, and I need to get the size of each character I want to include in a Sprite texture. All works well and accurately, except for the character amp ascii 38. Even if I change the font, this character always return zero for the width. Height is good.p  pThe strangest thing is that, if I try to measure the concatenation of ampamp Chr38 amp Chr38, the result seems good  I havent check to see if the same code point in another range of the same font product the same error, so I dont know if the workaround if char is 38 test the size on 3838 will always work.p  pEDIT Sorry,Im so stupid. I completely forgotten to say Im under VB.Net but can understand C and I use OpenGL with OpenTK for the binding. TextRenderer is a class of GDi. I use this to create my font texture. This is really not an OpenGL issue.p

Negative 1136 pI look after builds of our products and have been asked to come up with a way of customising an existing build definition to build different branches when required. p  pThe build process for this product has several custom steps and actions already and the product has a large amount of project files that are built so its not effective to set up a new build definition for every new branch that is created.p  pThe build definition is set up to build from the Main branch. The aim is to enter a particular branch using a workflow argument that can be entered when a build is queued which will then be built instead of the default Main branch without having to edit the build definition.p  pI have a separate test program that I use for testing all my custom build activities and procedures on. In the workflow for this build definition, I have added a fair few build messages for logging purposes so that I can view the values of variables used in the build process. p  pI have also created a branch based on this test program ready for testing of a build definition that can be used to build more than one branchp  pfirst off, I ran a build for the original test solutions project files from the original branch, then changed the build definition so that the same would be done using the new branch and ran another build.

Negative 1136 pIm developing a game that is using box2d physics pretty intensively and my beta tester reported sloppy performance when there were a lot of objects on the screen. I was practically always hanging with the DEBUG version of the app and had pretty stable 60 fps all the time.  After fiddling with practically all the build settings I noticed that in the DEBUG build mode a flag codeONLYACTIVEARCHcode was codeYEScode whereas in RELEASE it was codeNOcode. After building RELEASE version only for ARMv6 and installing it on an ARMv7 capable device, we had stable 60 fps. Trying to build for ARMv7 Thumb gave a sloppy 30  50 worse performance again. There was also a slight performance hit visible in non physics simulated environments. The testing devices were iPod Touch 4, iPhone 4 and iPhone 3GS. Can you please share your opinions on why that could be so I have no idea  p

Negative 1136 pIm working on a crossplatform Firebreath plugin which is crashing on Windows. I use a static library containing classes which reference boost.asio. When I link this library against the plugin dll, I observe crashes when interacting with the ioservice subsystem ie, during socket construction. When I link the static library against an ordinary executable, the problem does emnotem occur. When I compile the contents of the static library directly into the plugin dll project, the crash does emnotem occur. I have gone to great lengths to ensure that all aspects of my build environment on Windows are consistent build modes, version of Visual Studio, etc. In addition, Ive firewalled the boost.asio headers, so that the plugin dll code has no visibility of the boost.asio subsystem to no effect, unfortunately, vs2008 and vs2010. As far as I can tell, Ive done everything possible to ensure that the build environment is well behaved but the problem persists. p  pCan the community offer any advice on potential risks or approaches which could expose or solve the problemp

Negative 1136 pI have a database with a simple flyweight table referenced by another table. Lets call them, respectively, Category and Product.p  pThe Product table has several columns, one of which is a foreign key column complete with constraint to the CategoryID to a row of the Category table. Its simple, and I have many of them in this particular database. p  pI am using Linq in Visual Studio 2008 to represent this data in my application. Both tables appear as normal, and neither have anything special in their properties that would indicate the behaviour Ill describe.p  pIn the database itself, there are several Product rows which have codeCategoryID1code. There are two or three that have codeCategoryID2code. However, when the data is loaded into my application through Linq, iterating through codecontext.Productscode shows that the first three have codeCategoryID1code, codeCategoryID2code and codeCategoryID3code, and all the rest of the rows have codeCategoryIDNULLcode. This is not how it appears in the database. There are no other anomalies in this database.p  pHelpp  pedit Ive posted an answer below, but maybe the DevExpress guys can chime in Im happy its now working correctly but Im not happy that I still dont understand what went wrong.p

Negative 1136 pCurrently as a trail effect in my game I have for every 5 frames a translucent texture copy of a sprite is added to a Listlt of trails. p  pThe alpha values of these trails is decremented every frame and a draw function iterates through the list and draws each texture. Once they hit 0 alpha they are removed from the Listlt.p  pThe result is a nice little trail effect behind moving entities. The problem is for about 100 entities, the frame rate begins to drop drastically. p  pAll trail textures come from the same sprite sheet so i dont think its batching issue. I profiled the code and the CPU intensity is lower during the FPS drop spikes then it is at normal FPS so I assume that means its a GPU limitation p  pIs there any way to achieve this effect more efficientlyp  pHeres the general code im usingp  precode fade alpha malpha  intgameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalMilliseconds  10.0f   draw if malpha gt 0       p is used to alter RGB of the trails color mtint depending on alpha value     float p  floatmalpha255.0f     Color blend  new Colorintmtint.Rp, intmtint.Gp, intmtint.Bp, malpha                     draw texture to sprite batch     Globals.spriteBatch.Drawmtexture, getOrigin, mrectangle, blend, getAngle, new Vector2mrectangle.Width2, mrectangle.Height2, mscale, SpriteEffects.None, 0.0f                  else           flag to remove from Listltgt         misDone  true                 codepre  pI guess i should note, the mtexture given to the trail class is a reference to a global texture shared by all trails. Im note creating a hard copy for each trail.p  pEDIT If I simply comment out the SpriteBatch.Draw call, even when im allocating a new trail every single frame for hundreds of objects there is no drop in frames... there has got to be a better way to do this.p

Negative 1136 pI am looking to make a small rpg game using phpmysqljavascript but I have a quick question, would it be better to store all data for items etc in the database. For instance a table called items, where the name, cost, sell cost, stats etc are in it for each item. Or would it be better to make php classes for each item and just store the item type and level in the database. If it is the last one, how would I go about doing this in the right way, I know how to make classes etc, but dont understand how they would work in this situation.p  pAny advice would be nice, thanks.p
Negative 1136 pI am trying to figure out how to manage codeitemscode in my program. I want to have a unified codeinventorycode system that knows where every codeitemcode is. Then have codecontainercode objects that actually hold the inventoried codeitemscode, and have everything locateable by codecontainercode id.p  pMy thought was to have codeitemscode held inside the codecontainerscode inside codeboostptrvetorscode, and then hold a pointer probably the same one inside a hash table inside the codeinventorycode object, now shifting things around in terms of the codeinventorycode is easy that just changing a single value, and moving things from codecontainercodeX to codecontainercodeY is just a matter of removing from one pointer vector, and passing it to the other container, or doing all the work in one codecontainercode, or another.p  pThe problem that I am having trouble considering is when it comes time to get all the stuff out. I have only really ever dealt with having a pointerobject held in one place at a time not multiple, and I know that if I try to delete something that has already been deleted it will cause a crash at the least. The first thing that comes to mind is to remove all the references from the codecontainerscode, and still have it reside in the codeinventorycode, and then step through, and delete the codeinventorycode. Is this feasible, or am I not considering this right, and need to reconsider this then what if I only need to remove a single thing keep the rest p  pI am concerned about devalidating the pointers in either case.p

Negative 1136 pI feel the difference between Safari 5.1.5 and Google Chrome 18.0 on Mac OS X 10.7.3 are very noticeable.

Negative 1136 pIm writing an app that does some audio analysis for use as a guitar tuner with the addition of chord estimation and some other stuff, but Im having some trouble with the GUI. The first problem is that I have a button which, upon clicking should change its displayed text. When it is clicked, the text does not change, but the line of code that should change it is definitely reached.p  pAnother thing is that I need a SwingWorker to execute repeatedly restarting once it has finished and update the GUI each time. As my code is at the moment, I have a while loop repeatedly executing my SwingWorker, but this is causing the GUI to become unresponsive since it is running in the EDT presumably. What would be the best way to have the SwingWorker repeatedly execute Should I just create a new thread to run the loop in, or something elsep  pCode for my inner ActionListener class is as followsp  precodeprivate class TunerListener implements ActionListener      private boolean firstUpdate  true     private volatile boolean executing  false      private final SwingWorkerltVoid, Voidgt tunerWorker  new SwingWorkerltVoid, Voidgt           Override         protected Void doInBackground              model.update             return null                   Override         protected void done              if this.isCancelled                  prev.setTextmodel.getPrev                 currentNote.setTextmodel.getNote                 next.setTextmodel.getNext                 frequency.setTextmodel.getFrequency                 switch model.getOffset                      case 2                         light2.setIcononRed                         light1.setIconoff                         light0.setIconoffBig                         light1.setIconoff                         light2.setIconoff                         break                     case 1                         light2.setIconoff                         light1.setIcononRed                         light0.setIconoffBig                         light1.setIconoff                         light2.setIconoff                         break                     case 0                         light2.setIconoff                         light1.setIconoff                         light0.setIcononGreen                         light1.setIconoff                         light2.setIconoff                         break                     case 1                         light2.setIconoff                         light1.setIconoff                         light0.setIconoffBig                         light1.setIcononRed                         light2.setIconoff                         break                     case 2                         light2.setIconoff                         light1.setIconoff                         light0.setIconoffBig                         light1.setIconoff                         light2.setIcononRed                         break                                                   Override     public void actionPerformedActionEvent ae           if ae.getActionCommand.equalstune              if executing                  tune.setTextStop Tuning                 executing  true                  while executing                      tunerWorker.execute                     firstUpdate  false                                  firstUpdate  true              else                  tune.setTextStart Tuning                 executing  false                 tunerWorker.canceltrue                 firstUpdate  true                              codepre  pstrongEdit The button text issue seems to have been fixed now, but I still cant get this SwingWorker to work properly.

Negative 1136 pI have observed that when I add more than 18 parameters to a Play Framework Formclass I get a long and for me incomprehensible compilation error.p  pIs this a documented limitation I need to take in as much as 29 parameters in a form post. I dont decide on the design and number of parameters as I am implementing a protocol from an open standard.p  pIm mapping like thisp  precodeval registration  Formmapping     clienttype gt nonEmptyText,     clientid gt optionalnonEmptyText,     ... up to 29 args, all optionalnonEmptyText      clientType, clientId ... gt RegistrationRequestclientType, clientId ...        req gt None  codepre  pMy strategy was to do the mapping this way instead of applyunapply and create an heirarchy of case classes. The reason is to work around the 22 arguments limit in Case classes, which was the first seemingly arbitrary limit I ran into. Up to 18 args mapping works, after that I get a long compilation error.p  pThe error message can be found here too long to include a hrefhttpsgist.github.com2928297 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.com2928297ap  pIm looking for suggestions on how I can get around this limitation.

I then use the resulting Map[String, String] and continue processing with the form class, doing validation etc as usual. This allows me to use nested case classes in the mapping and get below the 18 params limit.p  pBeware ugly code ahead I should probably not show early hacky code like this, but Im hoping it will help someone else who wants a workaround.p  precodedef preprocessFormParamsprefixString, replaceStringimplicit requestRequest[AnyContent]Map[String, String]  request.body.asFormUrlEncoded.map .filterKeys .startsWithprefix.map m gt m.1.patch0, replace, prefix.length  gt m.2.head .getOrElseMap.empty def unprocessedFormParamsprefixesSet[String]implicit requestRequest[AnyContent]Map[String, String]  request.body.asFormUrlEncoded.map .filterKeys prefixes.contains .map m gt m.1 gt m.2.head .getOrElseMap.empty codepre  pSo these functions should probably be for comprehensions or split up, but here goes preprocessedFormParms takes a prefix and replaces itp  precodeval clientParams  preprocessFormParamsclient, client. clientid gt val1, clienttype gt val2 becomes client.id gt val1, client.type gt val2 codepre  pWhen I have the parameters in the form of group.key1, group.key2 I can nest the case classes in the form like sop  precodeFormmappingclient gt mappingtype gt nonEmptyText     id gt optionalnonEmptyText,     secret gt optionalnonEmptyText     RegisterClient.applyRegisterClient.unapply     ... more params ...

If your parameters dont have the same prefix for easy grouping like my problem, then you can still use the same basic approach but filter on other criterias.p

Negative 1136 pIve come across a problem to which the simplest solution would be to extend the length of a UIGestureRecognizer. What I mean is that I need the iOS device to still believe the user has their finger on the screen for about 0.1 seconds after they release it. I need the device to think that the finger is in the exact same position for the 0.1 seconds as it was when the user released this. Any help as to weather this is possible would be greatly appreciated Thank youp  pEDIT Sorry for the late reply, Ive been really busy with work.p  pTo elaborate, Im using a set of classes made by Alan Quartermain called AQGridView. Its a class that strongly resembles UITableView however, it displays data in a grid instead of a list. There appears to be a bug where if I understand correctly, and I may very well not the data of the grid is reloaded before the delegate method, that is called when a user ends a UIGestureRecognizer, finishes if the user releases their finger while dragging a cell from one grid index to another very quickly. This causes a graphical glitch which can be recreated in the springboard example that comes with the class set where the dragging cell appears to settle one cell before or after its appropriate location, and then quickly jumps to its proper location. I believe this is because there is a brief period, when the user releases their finger, where the grids count is 1 of what it is when the cell settles. This is a poor explanation of the problem, but the best I could come up with. As well, Im a relatively new developer and could be way off on the cause of the problem. That is why I believe the most appropriate fix would be to extend the gesture length by a very small amount. If anyone wants to take a look at the AQGridView classes httpsgithub.comAlanQuatermainAQGridView I would really appreciate it But if possible a simpler fix would just be to simulate the touch that the user inputed right before they released their finger so that the desired animation occurs.p

My question is Can I implement codeGetHashCodecode in my abstract base class to provide a suitable override for any concrete implementation  I.e. to avoid overriding codeGetHashCodecode in each concrete class.p  pIm imagining a method in my abstract base class something like thisp  precodepublic abstract class FooBase      private static readonly int primeseed  13     private static readonly int primefactor  7      public override int GetHashCode               Seed using the hashcode for this concrete class Type so          two classes with the same properties return different hashes.         int hash  primeseed  this.GetType.GetHashCode          Get this concrete class public properties.         var props  this.GetType.GetPropertiesBindingFlags.Public         foreach var prop in props                       Factor in each of this concrete class public properties hashcodes.             hash  hash  primefactor  prop.GetHashCode                  return hash       codepre  pThis seems to work in some basic equality unit tests but I feel like Ive overlooked something.  I still have to provide an override in each concrete class to avoid the compiler Warning about not overriding GetHashCode, but at least this way I dont have to manually write an implementation for each one.p
Negative 1136 pIm in the design phase of creating a php mysql database where groups will need to share a member table but will need to have their own tables for other data like messages, setting, attendance and so on. p  pI was thinking that I could create all the tables in one database and give each of them a groupid that would allow you to filter by that group and only show that data.

Negative 1136 pIve always understood that codestrtokcode should be regarded with caution due to the fact that it modifies its input string by inserting NULLs at the last token locations.

Negative 1136 pIm using ASIHTTP in my project, and I need to support SSL connections with or without client certificate. From my view, four cases are possible during SSL handshakep  ul lipcase A server presents a trusted certificate but doesnt ask client to present one e.g a hrefhttpswww.gmail.com relnofollowhttpswww.gmail.coma, ...pli lipcase B server presents a selfsigned certificate but doesnt ask client to present one e.g. a hrefhttpswww.cacert.orgimagescacert4.png relnofollowhttpswww.cacert.orgimagescacert4.pngapli lipcase C server presents a trusted certificate and asks client to present onepli lipcase D server presents a selfsigned certificate and asks client to present onepli ul  pASIHTTP supports case A without problem.p  pCase C is also supported but I have to give a SecIdentityRef before starting the requestp  precode[request setClientCertificateIdentityidentity] codepre  pOther cases are not supported without completely turning off certificate validation at CFStream level, that I dont want to do.p  pFor me the normal behaviour that I want from ASIHTTP is to ask delegate for case B, C and D.  For case B and D, the delegate should be asked to trust or not the server certificate like it is done in a web browser. For case C and D, the delegate should also be asked to provide a certificate.p  pASIHTTP is based on a CFStream connection. Is there a way to configure CFStream so that it returns differents errors from case B, C and D  And then, detects these errors and notify delegate with the right callback p  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 1136 pIm working on implementing a neural network for a class project and I was just wondering if it is possible to do multiclass classification with a neural network without using softmax When I asked the TA about this he said that having multiple output layers isnt mathematically sound, but then I saw that Andrew Ng included a picture of a neural network with multiple outputs in his UFLDL tutorial on autoencoders, and then I see a lot of people talking about multiclass classification with neural networks without mentioning softmax. So I guess what I would like to know is whether it is appropriate to use multiple output layers without using softmax, and if so how would you do it and how would you interpret the results. p  pUFLDL link a hrefhttpufldl.stanford.eduwikiindex.phpUFLDLTutorial relnofollowhttpufldl.stanford.eduwikiindex.phpUFLDLTutorialap  pA big Thank You to all of you,p  pMichaelp

Negative 1136 pSo, we may be streaming tons of data from an http server through an http server to a client.  So http chunking  tcp flow control comes to mind.  Normally to be a man in the middle like this, our man in the middle would read from a downstream asynch socket and try to write upstream and if the write was async, we would need a callback. We would NOT read from the downstream socket again until the write callback is called which would cause tcp flow control to automatically take affect once the nic buffer fills upat least I have seen this occur before correctly.p  pSo I think I have two questions reallyp  ol liDoes any version playframework have a write callback so we know when the write has officially been sent through such that we can continue processing again.  li liDoes anyone know of a java http client that calls a hasData and I have to invoke a read next chunk until I stop which calls the typical hasHeadedHeaders h, hasStatusHttpStatus, hasChunkHttpChunk chunkli ol  pWell 2 would be ideal but anything close would be nice.p  pAlso, if I am wrong on any points, feel free to correct me.p  pthanks, Deanp

Negative 1136 pI was not able to find this answer by myself and I apologize if my search was not deep enough.p  pAfter so much time Ive been lurking in stackoverflow, I finally have the chance to drop my own question actually it makes me sad as Im fairly happy to show no one how dumb I am.p  pIm working on this website a hrefhttpitalianliving.fi relnofollowhttpitalianliving.fia pick english language and by far everything I needed is working as I think its supposed to. My issues comes with catalogs page, after I open one colorbox to display some external content, my footer seems not working as supposed to. Theres a [  ] at the bottom right which is supposed to openclose the footer it works well until I call any colorbox, after that call it goes messed up, it slides the footer up but as far as it opens it, it closes it as well. My code for that isp  precodefootertoggle.clickfunction         if this.text [  ]                      this.text[  ]             footer.animate height 240px , 400                     else              this.text[  ]             footer.animate height 20px , 400                  return false      codepre  pbut Im fairly sure the problem is with Colorbox itself. Any hint about how to proceed Any other way to toggle the footer otherwise Thank you very much in advance.p

Negative 1136 pI want to check if a character exists in a string. So codeAtomcode is the string and codeChcode the character. codenamecode is a predicate that converts the string in a list of numbers according to the ASCII code. p  pcodefindelementcode is a predicate that is supposed to be true only if element codeXcode is part of a list. codeCcode is a counter that tells us where exactly element codeXcode was found.p  pThis is the result I am getting p  precode existsprolog,g. [103][112,114,111,108,111,103] false. codepre  p 103 is the ASCII code of letter g and the list code[112,114,111,108,111,103]code is the list that represents the string prolog. The question codeexistsprolog,gcode should have provided a true response.p  pHowever the codefindelementcode predicate is working correctly. I dont understand why this is happening because when I type for example p  precode findelement5,[3,4,5,6,5,2],X. codepre  pI am getting codeX 3  X  5  false.code  p  pwhich is absolutely fine because it tells me that 5 is the 3rd and the 5th element of the list.p  pSo the problem is that codefindelementcode is working when I type something like code findelement5,[3,4,5,6,5,2],Xcode but it is not when I try to call the predicate exists which calls codefindelementcode.p  pThis is the codep  precodefindelementX,[XT],1.  findelementX,[HT],C findelementX,T,TEMPC, C is TEMPC 1.  existsAtom,Ch nameAtom,[XT], nameCh,Z, writeZ, write[XT], findelementZ,[XT],Count. codepre  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1136 pI have created the following parallax animation using stellar.js and waypoints. I am animating images instead of backgrounds and Im also fading in and out some text when switching slides. This all works when scrolling downwards but not when scrolling from slide 4 upwards.p  pIts as if when going up waypoints fires before the slide moves, so when going from slide 4 to 3 it still thinks the dataslide is 4.

Negative 1136 pstrongA synopsis of my questionstrongp  pIs it possible to use your own, custom variables the way that you can use [TARGETDIR] in the Registry screen of a Windows Setup project in VS2010 Specifically, I need to store my assemblys strong name and assembly version in the registry, in order to register a COM object on a machine without the installing user having admin rights.p  pI already tried using a custom action, and Id rather not continue down that road if possible.p  pstrongHere are the specifics, and what Ive triedstrongp  pRecently, my employer started blindly removing all employees admin rights from their machines.p  pI had created a COMexposed C class that Id been using on a few of my workstations, which is no longer able to be registered, because I no longer have the appropriate permissions under HKEYCLASSESROOT.p  pThrough Googling, I found out how to register all of the appropriate keys under HKCU, but now Id like to implement this in my deployment project.p  pI understand how to use the Registry screen within Windows Setup, but there are custom keysvalues that need to be stored install folder, assembly strong name, version.p  pI could use a custom action, but ideally, I want Windows Setup to manage my registry settings, because a its better than I am at automatically removing all the proper keysvalues upon uninstall, b during the install, registry changes are transactional amp rolled back upon install error, and c the logic for registry key installremovaltransactions is already written by Microsoft, and I wont have to rewrite it myself.p  pThe project was in VS2008 until today, but I just upgraded it to VS2010, so perhaps something has changed between 2008 and 2010 that might allow this behavior.p  pSo, rather than using a custom action, is there a better way to do thisp  pstrongEDITstrong I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma1801639864414thisa answer, which seems to suggest that you can access the Windows Install Registry table within your install project.

Negative 1136 pIS there some kind of non blocking timer I can use in my main thread that would invoke a function that would read a message queue to see if any worker threads had given me useful information to update the GUI With p  pOr would I have to resort to old fashioned polling  update when needed. p  pIs there some way of scheduling updates  I know you cant have cross thread call backs i.e my worker thread runs the call back on the main thread and Im not sure you can do this even with a continuation class.p  pI was wondering however if I could use a abstraction layer to pull it off, for instance in iOS I can easily run things on the main GUI Thread using GCD and Windows 8 has a way of having a function running once a future has completed on the thread it was invoked from. And Im guessing for Android because you are using JNI to interface to the VM, none of the C threads are the GUI Threads so it doesnt actually matter.p  pSo I could write a piece of code that abstracts this for each platform p

What is the proper way for the actor system to call the nonactor codep  pWhat Im trying to do is expose the immutable payload of an actor message directly to the nonactor world. For example, actor A retains the immutable payload say a map of a message that it receives from actor B as a volatile instance variable, and then exposes that variable to the nonactor world for performance reasons via a normal getter or a facade. That map is immutable, so its inherently threadsafe and thus does not require the overhead of routing messages, etc. Actor A is accessed by lots of nonactor threads and every once in a while, it receives an updated map from Actor B.p  precodepublic class ActorAFacade extends UntypedActor implements MapltString, Stringgt      private volatile MapltString, Stringgt immutableMap  Collections.emptyMap      Override     public String getObject key         return immutableMap.getkey           Override     public String putString key, String value          throw new UnsupportedOperationExceptionRead Only           ...

Negative 1136 pI have a Windows Form app with a handful of fields, including a Company Field and a Contact Field.

Negative 1136 pIm creating a WPF data access layer that probably doesnt require full MVVM at this stage but I might implement it.p  pIve successfully created a ComboBox that data binds to a foreign key value of a related table using a CollectionViewSource as the data source See my XAML below, the combo box works fine but the TextBlock doesnt.p  pI only want to display the ComboBox as the cell editing template and use a TextBlock for displaying the data when it is not being edited.

Negative 1136 pI have a Java application and i would like to spawn a new processstart a .bat file, that will essintially do the same thing as by doubleclicking on it. p  pI have tried both codeRuntime.getRuntime.execcode and codeProcessBuildercode in order to spawn that process. Both those approaches work they can start the .bat file, ibbut my problem is thatib they do not actually do the exact same thing as by double clicking on it. p  pMore specifically, this .bat file starts up a JVM java.exe MyMainClass which is configured to run using Windows SxS side by side. Thus, i have created appropriate bjava.exe.configb and  bjava.exe.manifestb files. When i doulbe click on that, the java application starts and the appropriate .dlls are loaded succesfuly reason i need SxS.p  pMy problem is that when i start the exact same .bat file with the exact same arguments and process environment, either by using codeProcessBuildercode or codeRuntime.getRuntime.execcode, it doesnt seem to take into consideration my SxS configuration, thus the .dlls that i need are not loaded at all, resulting in errors. p  pDoes anyone have any clue how to launch this .bat file the same way as windows laucnhes it when i am double clicking on it  Additionally, does anyone have any experience with Java SxS deployment I cannot really understand why ProcessBuilder ignores my SxS configuration.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 1136 pI have a NSMutableArray of NSDictionaries. I would like to be able to filter dynamically. For example. I have 3 types of filtersp  precode area  item  type codepre  pif area is chossen then I would like to filter the Array with the area predicate, However if the user then chooses to filter item too, the currently filtered area array will then have the item filter applied too it.p  pHowever if the area filter is removed then I would like to show the new item filter.p  pit gets even more complicated when type is introduced, however I am struggling to get this to work correctly and dont really know where to start with the logic of it. p  pI can get the array to filter based off the last selected predicate. So if I choose area then items the current filter will only be items not both.p  pany help, tips or example code would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1136 pI am working on a operating system project for my lab where Ive to work with the instruction pointer and instruction opcode. Right now all I need to know is what type of instruction it is. For that Im reading the data from the address pointed by instruction pointer. The first byte from this data gives me the instruction type. For example if first byte is code0xC6code it is a codeMOVBcode instruction. Now there are some cases when the first byte of instruction pointer is code0x0Fcode. According to documentation code0x0Fcode which means it is a two byte instruction. My problem is with this type of instruction. Im not sure how to find out the instruction type for two byte instruction.p  pAfter that my 2nd priority is two find out the operands of the instruction. Ive no knowledge of doing that from code. Any sample code will be appreciatedp  pThird comes the need to find out the size of the instruction. As x86 is variable length, I want to know the size of each instructions. At first I planned to use a look up table where Ill maintain the instruction name and its size. But then I discovered that the same instruction can have variable length. For example when I used object dump on a code.ocode file I found two instruction codeC6 00 62code which is for codeMOVB   0x62,EAXcode amp codeC6 85 2C FF FF FF 00code which is for codeMOVB   0x0,0xD4EBPcode. Look here both instruction type is samecodeC6code but the are of different length.p  pSo Im in need of answers to those questions. Itll be highly appreciated if someone can give me some solutions.p

Negative 1136 pIm new to Android and am following the example a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingbasicsfirstappstartingactivity.html relnofollowherea. I can get the Layout fine, and the button event fires, but Android Studio doesnt seem to work in the same way as Eclipse does in their example. p  pI add a new Activity but Android Studio forces a new Fragment to be added as well.

Negative 1136 pI currently dont implement namespaces will probably switch in the future but I wanted to get the same benefits out of phpdocumentor using packages and subpackages.  Otherwise it will just live everything under the default one  and its messy.p  pI want to be able to assign some kind of logical ordering,p  pRoot   libs     libsstuff     libsother stuff   content     contentmore content   etcp  pSo its better organized.  But when I use package and subpackage it doesnt do anything, Ive tried full pathing everything and playing around with different combinations, regenerating, and clearing my browser cache.  It never changes the organization unless I explicitly use namespaces in my code and it parses it, than it fixes the organization.p  pI didnt think that was the case when I read the docs on phpdocumentor, I thought it said subpackages was a workaround and not to use both for maintainability ie if you use namespaces dont use subpacakge tags.p  pAm I wrong  Can someone show me a few examples of a working organization using package and subpackagep  pThe reason Im not using namespaces is because it broke my auto load stuff and I wanted to avoid people having to do Iwanttocontstructthisobject for example...so I need to read more up on namespaces, auto loading, and real world applications because I want to make things as simple as possible for people extending the code.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1136 pSee a hrefhttpjsbin.comsicir2editthis JSBina in IE10 or 11.p  pIf you inspect the codetestcode element, youll see that it shows the transition property as codewebkittransformcode and the transition does not happen. If you comment out the codetransition webkittransformcode declaration, as shown a hrefhttpjsbin.comsicir3editherea, then the transition works.p  pWhy is IE not dropping the vendorprefixed value as an invalid property value Incidentally, if I do something similar on Chromeput, say, codemstransitioncode after codewebkittransitioncodeit drops it as it should, and uses only the codewebkittransitioncode declaration. It seems to only be on IE that this is a problem.p

Negative 1136 pI am new to Git, and trying to determine how to best implement it.p  pI have the following four machinesp  ol liLinux server running GitLabs which stores my main repository.li liLinux production server running Apache, etc.  I am not currently concerned about this part.li liLinux development server running Apache, etc.  It also runs Samba and maps varwww to Windows.  It is located in my home and is on a LAN.li liWindows 7 PC running a PHP IDE happens to be PhpED.  It is located in my home and is on the same LAN as the Linux development server.  It directly edits the files in the Samba folder on the Linux development server, as well as uses this folder for debugging, and does not have code directly on it. The IDE has some basic Git functionality via TortoiseGit, however, I dont yet know how strong it is.li ol  pI am currently not concerned about sharing files, but only version control.p  pIve read that Git is all about being local. Giving my configuration, does that mean Git is run on the Windows PC even though my working directory is not located on it Or is it handled just using Linux between varwww and the GitLab repository How do you envision I implement Git under this configurationp  pThank you p

Negative 1136 pI really had struggled on this issue as Ive been reading through lots of threads here , but none seemed to really fit my needs. So, I havep  precode     mydomain.com which is the portal of the game, global setting and stuff game.mydomain.com which is the the actual game codepre  pThe problem is that I want to set a cookie that is available globally, on codegame.mydomain.netcode, codemydomain.netcode and whatever subdomain im going to create in the future.p  pIve been trying to set the cookie from another subdomain as Ive read that subdomains can set cookies to parent domains but not vice versa which is wierd and I guess Ive read it wrong. Whatever, so Ive done another account.mydomain.com from which Im making an ajax call form mydomain.net so the user can authenticate and Im usingp  precodesetcookiesession, value, time  2592000 one month, , .tribul.net codepre  pThen, return the success message and refresh the main page on mydomain.net so it can read the new cookie value.. problem is, theres no cookie set. Ive also been trying to set the cookie from mydomain.com as .tribul.net so it can be avaialable on all subdomains but its available only on the main domain.. so.. bare with me. Whats wrong p  pI need to connect all subdomains and the domain to the same cookie, TO BE NOTICED, I am setting the cookie in a backend file named process.php placed in account.domain.com as result of an ajax request.p

Negative 1136 pI need to learn Mockito for my current project and am struggling mightely. I might add that ive also never been taught anything on unit testing either and very little in java for that mater, haha so I seem to have to learn multiple things at once. I have spent awhile looking at a number of resources on Mockito but could still use some help. Below I have created a small example that Im hoping someone can answer for me on creating a JUNIT for it in Mockito.p  precodepublic class Animal      public numberOfTeethAnimalType animal           if animalAlive                Teeth tooth animal.getNumberOfTeeth                 iftooth null                           throw new ValidationExceptionInvalid Tooth                                           codepre  pPlease excuse the syntax errors, this is a quick made up example for learning.p  pSo lets say animalAlive is a private method in the Animal Class and getNumberOfTeeth is a public method in some other class.

Negative 1136 pWe are having an app running and identify our users using Facebook Login. Unfortunately Facebook Login isnt the best way to log in to an app and our users want something different. So, were trying to discuss a new way of logging into our app. We came up with a passwordless login solution which is basically a webthing and not yet very common in smartphone apps.p  pOne idea is to let the user enter his username and email on registration and save this to our web service. The user gets an email with his login credentials or a link with a token that identifies him within the app. The problem might be that email is the wrong medium for an app login confirmation.p  pA second idea is to generate a local token and use this as password which is synced across the users devices via e.g. iCloud. This way we have no clue if the user is actually real.p  pOur third idea is a bit of a mix where the user only needs a password when he wants to login on an different device.p  pSo, what do you think could be the best way to implement such a mechanism into a crossplatform smartphone appp  pHave we completely missed something importantp  pI would appreciate productive suggestions.p

Negative 1136 pIs there a way to get Cobertura to gather testcoverage over several .jarfiles. The problem I have is that after a refactoring of classes that where covered, being in the same .jar, are no longer being reported as covered since they now are in a separate .jar. p  pSo, the question, for a earproject, containing several sourceprojects .jar, is there a way to get the actual coverage for the earproject instead of a sum of of .jarcoverages. p  pBasically, the tests reflects behaviour, not codestructure. Since we only changed structure, the behaviour isnt changed. Therefore the tests should not need to change and since the tests are not changed then the coverage should not change.p

Even Ive set up a codesetTimeoutcode, so I can detect timeout, too.p  pUpon timeout, I should abort the request. Browsers have limit on image request per same domain, and the stucked images should eat this limit up, pausing further image downloads.p  pIve tried codedeletecode the image element, remove from the DOM, setting new value to code.srccode attribute, but neither helps.

Negative 1136 pMy question Will my solution work longterm and with different type of attachmentsp  pI have a very simple Access 2007 database where we store projectrequests. When en existing request is changed, I save the original request in a history table, by copying the whole record in the event FormBeforeUpdate. One of the fields is of the type Attachment, which I cannot copy to the historytable with a simple SQL. I run the function listed below after the copying of all other fields are done. I could use the methods LoadFromFile and SaveToFile, but I want to avoid that as I think it will be slow.  I have concluded that the Attachment is actually a recordset, so I experimented by just copying all the fields in it, and it seem to work. I tried with different file types excel, word, text, xml...br The keycode is to simply assign all the fields inside the Attachment recordset. I got an error on all fields except FileData and FileName, so I simply put the On Error Resume Next to not make the cope stop.p  pAs I have developed this by experimenting, I dont know if something in the code is a timebomb... p  precodeSub MoveAttachment2HistProjID As Long, UpdDate As Date  Purpose    Copy the attachments from the Projects table to the Projects Hist table Expects    ProjID  The project ID for which we should copy the attachments            UpdDate The UpdDate on the row in the Hist table.

Negative 1136 pOkay so I found some code that lets me trigger the default mail client using MAPI from my winform application.  This works pretty well... except for some unexpected behaviour with the popped up window.p  pInitially I was triggering the email client popup window from a Modal Dialog within my application.  This opened an outlook window with my attachment and recipient.  The only slight problem with this approach was that the outlook window is also modal and I cant interact with the application until it is closed. A little annoying but not a major issue.  p  pThe real problem I have is when I decided to remove the modal dialog and launch the popup directly from the main application form.  The popup window opens as I expect, and I can click onto and write into the body text, however I cannot seem to interact with any other buttons on the popup window. It also cant be closed unless I open up Task Manager and then suddenly the minmaxclose buttons for the window become clickable.  Can anyone tell me why the window behaves differently depending on where I launch it fromp  pThe following code was originally triggered from a button click event on a modal dialog.  I changed it to be triggered by a click event on a picture box.p  precode    [DllImportMAPI32.DLL]     static extern int MAPISendMailIntPtr sess, IntPtr hwnd, MapiMessage message, int flg, int rsv      int SendMailstring strSubject, string strBody, int how              MapiMessage msg  new MapiMessage         msg.subject  strSubject         msg.noteText  strBody          msg.recips  GetRecipientsout msg.recipCount         msg.files  GetAttachmentsout msg.fileCount          mlastError  MAPISendMailnew IntPtr0, new IntPtr0, msg, how, 0          Cleanupref msg         return mlastError      codepre

Negative 1136 pHello I am using openCV image processing tools with Visual Studio 2013 and I added necessary libraries and paths to my solution and created a project in that solution. However, when I want to create another project in that solution with the same preferenceslibraries etc, these do not get added. p  pI really dont understand why since I do not create a new solution but I simply create a new project in the same project.  Do I have to manually add all of these libraries again Or is there an easier way to do this Also, wouldnt be a lot better and easier to use same preferences inside the same solutionIsnt that the sole purpose of having a new solution How can I fix this problem p

Negative 1136 pI am new to programming.  p  pI am working with WPF, Entity Framework, XAML, and C.  I built a DataGridView in XAML to display data from a CollectionViewSource.  I also wanted to edit this data in the DataGridView.  Regarding 2 of the DataGridViews columns, I wanted to edit via a ComboBox that is dynamically linked to a list of items that can be input into that cell.p  pI bind the DataGridView control and its columns to these CollectionViewSources.  p  pThe problem is with the first EditTemplate and the dbGradeComboBox.  After selecting an item from the ComboBox and losing focus ie. editing another cell in the row, the cell immediately goes back to displaying the TextBlock which is bound to the old data from the store.  It doesnt keep the EditTemplate and the newly selected ComboBox item.  p  pContrary to this dbGrade ComboBoxs behavior, the dbContraComboBox selection correctly remains on display while I edit other cells in that row.  Only upon leaving the selected row in the DataGridView will I confirm and Save to the datastore.  Hence I want all the edits to remain displayed until confirmcancel is triggered.p  pPartial Copy of XAML.  I can post more code if needed.p  p         p  pThe EditTemplates switch the cell from displaying the contents from the datastore to a ComboBox with items in a dropdown list.

Negative 1136 pIm building a basic table view on iOS 8. I watched the WWDC 14 video on the topic of autosizing cells and am trying to reproduce the concept, but am having some issues. On viewDidLoad I am callingp  precodeestimate for my cells though they may vary  self.tableView.estimatedRowHeight  300.0  self.tableView.rowHeight  UITableViewAutomaticDimension codepre  pWhen my view and table load up, performance is ok. When I click on a cell, the program takes me to a detail view. When I hit the back button on that view and return to the table view, thats when things start acting weird. The cells then start jumping while I am scrolling. By jumping I mean that they dont scroll smoothly  they tend to jerk or jump from one place to the next. p  pI should add that memory is not a concern since the cells are being reused and there is little data in the background. The constraints on my cells in storyboard file are also blue and I am seeing no autolayout constraint exceptions in the debugger.p  pHas anyone else seen this kind of behavior with strongemUITableViewAutomaticDimensionemstrong Is it just an Apple bug or is there more to it Thanks.p

Negative 1136 pI have a .gml file at my hand and an xml file as well. I want to compute the betweenness centrality of a node for which I borrowed a code from the internet. The code is in python and makes use of networkx. The input to this betweenness function must be in the .gml format. However the .gml file I have for the network doesnt have a necessary attributeedge weights to input to the betweenness function. Incase I have the edge weights as an attribute in the .gml file, the betweenness function works more efficiently. So, I tried collecting the edge weights from the .xml file I havein the form of a dictionary edgeID cost, edgeID, cost....... and using them to create a new .gml file altogether with this added attribute. But, Im totally confused about how to proceed. I would be glad if someone could help me in creating the modified version of the .gml file. I shall post a few lines of the filep  precode      edge [     id      14     source  6     target  11      graphics [       fill   000000       width  1       style  standard     ]   ]    edge [     id      15     source  7     target  9      graphics [       fill   000000       width  1       style  standard     ]   ] codepre  pIf I can just add another line called costs and put its value there, my work would be done.

Negative 1136 pThis is more of a general question regarding Git, but Im applying it towards SS so thought Id ask here. Im a designer learning Git.p  pIm looking for best way to work dev environment and live server. My setup now is to use composer and GitHub for Mac locally to work on projects on my Mac. I then use a hrefhttpsgithub.comheydaybeam relnofollowBeama to deploy to live server.p  pThe issue Im having is I cant commit SS modules to my repo for the project. Using GitHub for Mac, and it says failed to add emmodulenameem to index. Im still not clear on why this is happening. Because theyre submodules with gitp  pSo what I do is use Beam to deploy things like theme, custom code to live server, then from live server I login and run composer to install and update modules. It would be ideal if I could just push everything from my dev server live, and not have to login and run composer commands on live server. This would also help for client sites that dont have composer installed on crappy shared hosting.p  pSo is there a workaround or better method for deploying to live servers I am unaware ofp

If I open a file by pressing Enter in the speedbar window, then the new file always get opened in the same buffer window B which I opened last. Can I somehow specify that the new content should be opened in buffer window Ali liCurrently the speedbar window refreshes itself automatically to the new location whenever I open a new file using Cx Cf. This is actually pretty useful, but sometimes I dont want this when I am quickly trying things out in a tmp file. And the refresh also destroys my treeview of the speedbar, where I expanded the directory contents rather than opening them directly.

So far my code takes in a command, splits it up using strtok into an array argv and then I call fork to create a child and execute the command. Im working on this in ubuntu where most of the commands are in the bin directory, so I append the program name for example binls and use that for the first arg of execvp and then I give it the argv array. My program works if I type in the command ls, but when trying other commands or even ls l Im getting an ls invalid option.

The problem is that if hes standing on the coal and pressed space more than one time the coal gets added more then one time to his inventory, AND thats the problem.He can mine more coal even no more is there. I have searched google but the only thing that i found out was that i have to use flag , some boolean values ...but HOW  p  pI know the code is written were dirty,ugly etc...can be optimized...p

Negative 1136 pFrom all my readings and research on OO designpatternsprinciples Ive found that the general consensus is that loose coupling and high cohesion is the almost always the better design. I completely agree speaking from my past software project experiences.p  pBut lets say some particular software company which I dont work at has some questionably designed large scale software that interacts with some hardware. The modules that I never worked on are so tightly coupled and function calls that goes 20 levels deep to manage states. Class boundaries are never clearly defined and use cases poorly thought up. A good software developer not me would bring up these issues but only get turned down by the more senior developers that development practices like SOLID or TDD doesnt really apply because the software has worked for years using the traditional methodology, and its too late to change. And the biggest complains from the customers which I dont know who they are are of the quality of the product.p  pBecause of the above unrealistic scenario I was never apart of, I thought about if there are cases where tight coupling is preferred or even required When are there cases where developer needs to cross module boundaries and share states and increase dependency and reduce testability What are some examples of systems thats so complex that would require this I couldnt come up with a good case myself so Im hoping some of the more experienced craftsmen can help me out.p  pThanks. Again, I dont know this company.p

Negative 1136 pI am creating a game for the iPhone, and the main screen is a list of games that the current user has in progress. I want to use the parse local datastore because my queries take a long time when there are a lot of games in progress. I have a question about the datastore that does not seem to be answered clearly in the docs.p  pWhen the app opens, I query my table of games in the background, sort them based on status your turn, their turn, over, and display them in a table. In order to speed this process up I would like to pin all of these objects to the local datastore.p  pWhen the user refreshes the tableview to see if any of the game statuses have changed, I would like to query the datastore to retrieve all of the relevant objects, but then also query the network for any emchangesem in the objects, and for any new ones. However, it does not seem that there is anyway to make the local datastore uptodate. The only way I have seen is to query the network completely, unpin currently stored objects, and pin the newly retrieved objects. If this is the case, I do not see the point in using the local datastore because my queries will be just as slow.p  pBasically, everytime the user pulls to refresh the table, I would like the datastore to be queried, and then the network to check for any new objects or changed columns.p  pSo, is there a way to query the local datastore and subsequently update those objects andor add new ones from the networkp  pI have also realized that I am doing quite a bit of sorting. Could this have an affect on the long wait time for the table to loadp

Negative 1136 pIm using a CLI tool to build hybrid mobile apps which has a cool upload feature so I can test the app on a device without going through the app store its ioniccli. However, in my company like so many other companies TLS requests are resigned with the companys own custom CA certificate which I have on my machine in the keychain OS X. However, nodejs does not use the keychain to get its list of CAs to trust. I dont control the ioniccli app so I cant simply pass in a  ca  property to the https module. I could also see this being a problem for any node app which I do not control. Is it possible to tell nodejs to trust a CAp  pI wasnt sure if this belonged in Information Security or any of the other exchanges...p

Negative 1136 pIm a little lost on exactly what route to take in order to achieve my goal here.

Now I want to take that idea, and apply it to a feed so it can be updated daily, and displayed in table format. But somewhere along the way, the user needs to input at least 2 variables. p  p...I emthinkem that would take care of most of my issue.p  pThe point is that a user comes to the site and sees a table populated with data. The user needs to be able to input a variable, which will then be applied to the displayed data. p  pI dont know if I need to use a mySQL db for this, or if I can just use the plugin.p  pI dont know if I need to import the data into this plugin, and output it to another plugin, then bounce it back to the wpDataTables plugin to be displayed.p  pOverall, I feel like Im over complicating things as there must be a plugin that does exactly this.p  pOr, the thought crossed my mind because I dont know much about Databases or MySql, would it be possiblebest to simply import the xml feed into the DB, and have IT apply the calculation, but leaving a field empty for the users variable to be entered, which could be automatically appliedp  pIm pretty lost as you can tell lol. Any help in pointing me in the right direction, or at least giving me a starting point, would be so very greatly appreciated. Thanks so much everyonep

Negative 1136 pI fully expect this is really simple, but I am finding myself overwhelmed and buried in excessive information  Can somebody please point me to, or just write a simple getting started with Office 365 APIs in C  .Netp  pA really specific task Id like to accomplish is to simply open Visual Studio, create some sort of C project, and programmatically create a Distribution Group in Office365. I would expect, I just go to NuGet, add some Assembly, and be on my way. But Im having difficulty finding the right thing to do...p  pI found this article a hrefhttpblogs.office.com20140512netandjavascriptlibrariesforoffice365apis relnofollow.NET and JavaScript libraries for Office 365 APIsa which suggests I need to install Office 365 API Tools for Visual Studio, but when I did that, I got a web installer with simply hundreds of things in it that I could install  and none of them seemed to be the right thing. I emmayem have gotten what Im looking for by just running that installer and not selecting additional addons, but I would never know, because theres nothing suggesting what to do next. Do I need to create a project from a particular template Go to some new menu under Visual Studio that wasnt there before Install a NuGet package Im lost...p  pThanks for pointers.p  pSidenote The article I mentioned says to tag stackoverflow questions with codeOffice365APIscode but when I try that, stackoverflow says emCreating the new tag Office365APIs requires at least 1500 reputation.em So I cant.

Negative 1136 pIm confused about how to decide the delta values on eight significant decimal digits.p  pInstruction  p  pFor the JUnit test cases, base the delta value on eight significant decimal digits. This will be the limit of accuracy required to pass the JUnit test.p  pVery Important Note Eight significant decimal digits is not the same as eight places after the decimal point. It does work out that way for a few numbers. In other words, the value of delta used in the test should be approximately proportional to the expected output value, n. Actually, the correct order of magnitude is sufficient for this case.p  pLets say were working with the square root of nine million. The expected answer n is three thousand.p  pWhat should delta be Not 0.00000001 1e8.  n is 3e3, right So delta should be Xe5, where X is between 1 and 9.99.  So, 1e5 would be good.p  pSo, if n is 10000000000000000000 1e19, what should the delta value be Or if n  0.000000000000000001 1e18p

Negative 1136 pI am writing a gem for Rails, which includes a generator to create a model. Under certain circumstances, the generator is supposed to call itself, and it uses the codegeneratecode method to do this. This works fine when actually using it.p  pI am using RSpec 3.2 with codegeneratorspeccode to try and test this functionality, but being a gem, when it gets to the codegeneratecode call, it complains that Rails doesnt existp  precodepathtoruby No such file or directory  binrails LoadError codepre  pSo I have been trying to stub the codeGeneratorgeneratecode method to make it do the same thing as coderungeneratorcode in the spec, immediately before the coderungeneratorcode calls that call codegeneratecode in the middle of them. However, for all of my potential solutions, I have run into problems.p  h3Outright overriding the class  cant use the spec method.h3  precodeclass Generator   def generateargs     rungenerator args[1..1]   end end codepre  pThis raises codeundefined method rungeneratorcode. Not surprising.p  h3Using a partial double  instantiated too late.h3  precodeallowgenerator.to receivegenerate  args rungenerator args[1..1]  codepre  pThis would be perfect, but coderungeneratorcode calls a emclassem method behind the scenes, so the codegeneratorcode in question doesnt exist yet.p  h3Using an instance double  disallows other methods.h3  precoderecursible  instancedoubleGenerator allowrecursible.to receivegenerate  args rungenerator args[1..1]  testcaseinstance.generatorclass  recursible codepre  pHowever, using a double requires you to stub emallem the methods on it that are going to be used  and all the rest would simply be calling their original implementations. That seems difficult and unnecessary. Is there any way to get round itp

Negative 1136 pI am a new user to Kafka and have been playing around with it for about 23 weeks now. I believe at the moment I have a good understand of how Kafka works for the most part, but after attempting to play around with and design my own Kafka consumer this is obscure but Im following the guidelines for the new KafkaConsumer that is supposed to be available for v 0.9, which is out on the trunk repo atm Ive had latency issues consuming from a topic if I have multiple consumers with the same groupID. p  pIn this setup, my console consistently logs issues regarding a rebalance triggering. Do rebalances occur when I add new consumers to a consumer group and are they triggered in order to figure out which consumer instance in the same groupID will get which partitions or are rebalances used for something else entirelyp  pI also came across this passage from a hrefhttpscwiki.apache.orgconfluencedisplayKAFKAKafka0.9ConsumerRewriteDesign relnofollowhttpscwiki.apache.orgconfluencedisplayKAFKAKafka0.9ConsumerRewriteDesigna and I just cant seem to understand it, so if someone could help me make sense of it that would be much appreciatedp  blockquote   pRebalancing is the process where a group of consumer instances   belonging to the same group coordinate to own a mutually exclusive   set of partitions of topics that the group is subscribed to. At the   end of a successful rebalance operation for a consumer group, every   partition for all subscribed topics will be owned by a single consumer   instance within the group. The way rebalancing works is as follows.   Every broker is elected as the coordinator for a subset of the   consumer groups. The coordinator broker for a group is responsible   for orchestrating a rebalance operation on consumer group membership   changes or partition changes for the subscribed topics. It is also   responsible for communicating the resulting partition ownership   configuration to all consumers of the group undergoing a rebalance   operation.p blockquote

Cant post any image directly here, Id need more reputation on StackOverflow.p  pI was thinking overcomplicated for something that could be done by improving the way the data were arranged. It needs further work, but the problem I had is now solved.p  hr  pstrong[Original post]strongp  pI have GPS data all over Europe that I would like to plot on a map. The points were collected in batches, emi.e.em, when a GPS point was recorded, there are good chances that 5 or 6 other GPS points were saved nearby lets say lt 2 km further. When plotted on a map of such a large region, these batch points are too close to each other to be distinguished, and I dont need a high accuracy for the map anyway, but Id like to see all the points. Ive tried jittering the points but then, even if the accuracy is not mandatory for this particular map, Im not comfortable with jittering GPS coordinates. p  pAnother way to show all the points would be a sunflower representation for instance, or piecharts would be even more appropriate here because I could display slices of different colors on each pie, one color being associated with one level of factor variable for each data point. But then to group the nearby points I needp  ol lipto round the coordinates so that close points will actually have the exact same coordinates but finding the sweet spot to round the data will be tricky,pli lipto set a buffer around points so that, when several buffers are     superimposing, then the associated points all are plotted at the     averaged coordinates. Perhaps a clustering method on a distance     matrix computed from the coordinates would work too.pli lipto calculate the centroid of each group I could use an existing     factor variable for grouping points by region to plot the piechart there, but then the     piechart slices would still have to gather data from the individual     points.pli ol  pThe second and third solutions seem to be the most robust to me but Im not sure, please tell me, but I have absolutely no clue on how to do it. Any ideas For solution 3, I calculated the centroid of each group of points group  Region, a factor variable so that each row in the data frame also contains the centroid coordinates of its corresponding group. Then I could plot piecharts at these coordinates one pie per group, but then I dont know how to proceed if I want the pie slices to represent values taken from the individual rows in each group.p  pIve created the map already, using an updated version of worldHires of the emmapsem package. My data points are displayed individually on the map at the moment. I am not experienced with pie charts, but I guess I could find something by myself here, or ask further questions when the first problem about groupint the points is solved.p  pMany thanks in advance for your help andor suggestionsp

Negative 1136 pI am interested in developing a library that would sync a core data model across devices via the Parse mobile backend.

I am looking for feedback on my plan which is outlined below. This design is based off of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10168045isthisafunctionalsyncingalgorithmthis SO answera. p  pGeneral design of the library p  ol lipThe library would provide a standard core data stack that would set up the persistent store coordinator and managed object context. All of the standard core data CRUD operations would proceed through an interface provided by the library. pli lipEach time CUD operation takes place, a sync operation object would be saved to Parse in the background that includes all of the information needed to reproduce the operation. This includes the type of operation that took place, a unique identifier for the object that was operated on, and in the case of a create operation, the parent object and relationship would be provided. pli liEach operation would have a changeid number associated with it. Every time the device downloads and executed an operation, it would store the latest changeid associated with that operation. li liPrior to uploading each sync operation, the device would send a request to the server to ensure that the changeid number stored matches the one stored locally. If the changeid on the server is higher, it would first download all of the sync operations and execute them then upload its own sync operations. li liConflicts two devices editing the same value while offline would be resolved by determining which device changed the value last. li ol  pAm I missing anything here What are some potential pitfalls with this approach I hear that sync is hard, should this type of undertaking be left to the most experienced developersp

Negative 1136 pIs there a way in d3s packing layout to set the radius of a child node manually, with a size relative to the parent radius, and then have the other children set their radius based on the remaining space and using the existing size by number of childrenp  pWhat I would like to do is 1. for each node add a node to the children array with the same name as the parent 2. set the radius of this extra child to have a significant enough radius to contain text and ensure no overlap from its neighbors 3. set fill and stroke to none on this extra node 4. set the click interaction via css to none on this extra node 5. use only these extra nodes to display their names aka their parents namesp  pThe result would be a packed circle with a specially designated space for its labels. This does not work without a manual setting of the extra child nodes radius because its size is automatically determined based on the number of children. adding children unfilledunstroked nodes to compensate is extremely inefficient. The second hack for the first hack just wouldnt be worth it I dont thinkp

After failing to find a good solution with manual code along with downscaling my images to super low quality, Ive tried a number of different libraries, including SDWebImage, LRImageManager, Haneke, and PINRemoteImage. I just want to get a good idea or approach on tackling my apps memory management. How is it that other apps can load hundreds of fair quality photos in a dequeueable view Is it rocket sciencep

Negative 1136 pIs there any way to do a rollingupdate with a replication controller that has 2 or more containers  p  pFor example, I have Jenkins setup to automatically do a rolling update on a rep controller in our dev environment once a successful build takes place using the image flag specifying the new containers image stored in GCR.  This method doesnt work when there are two containers in the same pod and there is no c flag to specify the container you wish to update on the rollingupdate command as there is on other commands such as exec or logs.  p  pThe reason Im looking to have multiple pods is to implement a logging sidecar as in a hrefhttpsgithub.comkubernetescontribtreemasterloggingfluentdsidecares relnofollowhttpsgithub.comkubernetescontribtreemasterloggingfluentdsidecaresa  p  pThe only alternative I can think of is to bake the fluentd config into each container, which feels decidedly unkubernetes to me.  p

I had always thought matplotlib can take any arraylike inputs but apparently thats not quite true if the data is not simple numbers that require some internal gymnastics.p  pstrongUPDATE2strong I also tried to follow stronga hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers3666197user3666197user3666197astrongs suggestion thanks for the editing tips btw. If I understood correctly, I first converted codexcode into a series of matplotlib style daysp  precodemx  mPlotDATEs.date2numlistx codepre  pwhich then allows me to directly callp  precodescattermx, y, sz codepre  pthen to label axis properly, I callp  precodegca.xaxis.setmajorformatter DateFormatterYmd HM codepre  pcall codeshowcode to update the axis label if interactive modep  pIt worked quite nicely and feels to me a more proper way of doing things, so Im going to accept that as the best answer.p

Negative 1136 pOk, so generally, when searching for a substring in a table, you can search for something similar using wildcards i.e. abc will return emanythingem that contains that substring abc.p  pHowever, if Im looking for a specific format perhaps abc123 can I use a regex match to search for the additional string data Egp  precodecmd.CommandText  SELECT  FROM [tbl] WHERE [name] LIKE Param  Regex r  d cmd.Parameters.AddWithValueParam, abc  r codepre  pThis would then check all of your strings, and depending on the regex, it would compare the stringsp  ul liabc123  Matchli liabcd123  No matchli ul  hr  pstrongPost notestrong Im not really looking so much into the syntax of the regex right now, Im more interested to know whether or not this kind of process is empossibleem.p
