Positive 9780 pI was wondering if I write something like thisp  precodeType ampvar  database.getltTYPEgtname codepre  pAssuming that codedatabasecode is a container able to store datablocks of different datatypes. To get a reference to that datablock, the codenamecode as codestdstringcode is passed to get so that at different places with that call I have a way to access certain global variables. I have get as a template method and I would like to keep it that way.p  pWhat I want to do is shorten that call an elegant way like thisp  precodeType ampvar  database.getname codepre  pSo the template deduction is automatically performed. Now I could create a macro for that, but this is not what I want to do, as I do not consider it elegant for such case.p  pThat deduction though does not work, because we need a template parameter. Why cant the compiler take what is set for the variable and pass it as template parameter automatically Is there a way to do this I dont want to have any type conversions in this case. Can we omit itp

Is this possible  I dont want to go all the way down the road of researching SQL Reporting Services 2008 only to find that it doesnt do what I need it to do.  Also, I will have a ton of DB partitions that the data will need to be pulled from.

Negative 9780 pI have a query in a large MySQL table 4 million rows. This query is used in a stored procedure and it searches by surname and another numeric field. When I use different combinations of these search parameters, I get quick results between 1 and 2s but with some particular values, I get a query which takes 9s to return results on the production website. The following is what I got out of the EXPLAIN statementp  pre id, selecttype, table, type, possiblekeys, key,       keylen, ref,   rows, Extra  1,  SIMPLE,      Names, ref,  IXName,       IXName,   17,      const, 3173, Using where pre  pSurame is declared as varchar40 and the other field is unsigned smallint6. The index which is being used is IXName which consists of the prefixes of surname15 and forename10p  pI am not sure what I can do to improve the performance. Is there anything noticeably wrong with the EXPLAIN output above The query runs slowly only on rare combinations of the surname and the other field, but it is consistent in that they are always the same slow queries.p  pI tried dropping all indices and recreated them but this did not solve the problematic queries.p  pThe query plan shows that the index is being used and on different surnames and various values for the other numeric field the query can be instantaneous. However, it doesnt like when I search for the surname Fischer and a particular value for the numeric field this is one particular slow query.

Negative 9780 pI have an application that uses CoreData and Im trying to figure out the best way to implement tagging and filtering by tag.

Quite straightforward.p  pBut, is there a way to do this in CoreData and utilizing codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode It doesnt seem that codeNSPredicatecode give you the ability to filter through joins. codeNSPredicatescode arent full SQL anyway so Im probably barking up the wrong tree there.

Negative 9780 pMy app launches with a view controller and a simple view consisting of a button and a subview. When the user touches the button, the subview is populated with scrollviews that display the column headers, row headers, and cells of a spreadsheet. To draw the cells, I use CGBitmapContext to draw the cells, generate an image, and then put the image into the imageview contained in the scrollview that displays the cells. p  pWhen I run the app on the iPad, it displays the cells just fine, and the scrollview lets the user scroll around in the spreadsheet without any problems. If the user touches the button a second time, the spreadsheet redraws and continues to work perfectly, If, however, the user touches the button a third time, the app crashes. There is no exception information display in the Application Output window.p  pMy first thought was that the successive button pushes were using up all the available memory, so I overrode the DidReceiveMemoryWarning method in the view controller and used a breakpoint to confirm that this method was not getting called. My next thought was that the CGBitmapContext was not getting released and looked for a Monotouch equivalent of Objective Cs CGContextRelease function. The closest I could find was the CGBitmapContext instance method Dispose, which I called, without solving the problem. p  pIn order to free up as much memory as possible in case I was somehow running out of memory without tripping a warning, I tried forcing garbage collection each time I finished using a CGBitmapContext. This made the problem worse. Now the program would crash moments after displaying the spreadsheet the first time. This caused me to wonder whether the Garbage Collector was somehow collecting something necessary to the continued display of graphics on the screen. p  pI would be grateful for any suggestions on further avenues to investigate for the cause of these crashes. I have included the source code for the SpreadsheetView class. The relevant method is DrawSpreadsheet, which is called when the button is touched.p  pThank you for your assistance on this matter.p  pStephen Ashleyp  precode  public class SpreadsheetView  UIView

Negative 9780 pIm trying to longterm serialize a bunch of objects related by a strong class hierarchy in java, and Id like to use protocol buffers to do it due to their simplicity, performance, and ease of upgrade.  However, they dont provide much support for polymorphism.

Is there a better way to handle polymorphism, or is this as good as Im going to getp

Negative 9780 pI am using Cucumber as the BDD framework with rspecmocha mocking. Ideally we would not mockstub behavior in cucumber specs however the scenario is exceptional here. To give you the brief idea of problem here I have two features product feature and cart feature.p  pCart feature is currently mocking some of the product fetch from 3 party system. And in cucumber run cart feature runs before product feature. Product feature uses real call for some scenarios. Ideally we would expect that Class level stubs like Product.stubfind would be cleared once the scenarios are completed however that is not the case. Class level stubs linger on to the next cucumber scenario run and interfere with the call.p  pI interchangeably used mocha and rspec to induce the stubs but no avail in either case the stub remains and prevents my product feature to run after cart feature. Both of them run fine in isolation. p  pHas anyone faced similar issue of stubs not being reset in cucumber Is there a way, I can restore the original class behavior p  pAny help will be appreciated.p  pCheersp

Negative 9780 pThis is actually a two part question, hope my explanation is clearp  pI have an NSViewController which can be configured to show a different custom view on part of its view. For example, its view can show either CustomViewA or a CustomViewB.p  pI was able to make this work by creating an NSViewController for each of the custom views and initializing  MyViewController with either an NSViewController which handles the CustomViewA or an NSViewController which handles the CustomViewB. I use an NSBox and set its contentView to the view provided by the given NSViewController. p  pThe problem with this approach is that I have an NSBox whos contentView will hold the MyView and then inside MyView I have another NSBox which will hold either the CustomViewA or the CustomViewB.p  pThe other problem is that Id like MyViewController to handle both the CustomViewA and the CustomViewB, opposed to having a separate NSViewController for each one of them.p  pHere is sample code of my current solutionp  precode How I initialize the NSViewControllers CustomViewControllerA cvc  [[CustomViewControllerA alloc] initWithNibNameCustomViewA bundlenil] MyViewController controller  [[MyViewController alloc] initWithCustomViewControllercvc nibNameMyView bundlenil]  ...

Negative 9780 pIm trying to learn how to write Windows GUI programs in C, using Visual Studio 2008, but I havent found any more comprehensive tutorial for beginners.p  pThe more comprehensive tutorials I have found are either only about how to make buttons, menus, etc. OR only about how to write basic C console programs.p  pWhat I havent found is a more comprehensive tutorial for beginners on how to combine buttons, menus, etc. with C code.p  pIn other words, Im looking for answers to the question How do I link menus, buttons etc. to C codep  pIf you know where I can find answers to that question, post them here, pleasep  pNote Graphical User Interface GUI Includes such things as icons, panels, and interactive windows, to enable users to perform such actions as opening files and creating applications with the click of the mouse a hrefhttpwww.intoweb.co.zaetlinuxtips.htmlintoweb.co.zaetlinuxtips.htmla.p  hr  pIm currently reading a C tutorial at a hrefhttpwww.techotopia.comindex.phpCSharpEssentialstechotopia.coma, that seems to include not only C basics but also useful information on how to use C to get buttons, menus. etc. to actually do something. I only started reading the tutorial, though, so how useful it actually is I dont know yet. p  hr  pIve now finished reading the C tutorial at a hrefhttpwww.techotopia.comindex.phpCSharpEssentialstechotopia.coma and learned some basic facts about how to actually make controls on a windows form do something. Had I known what I now know about C earlier, I most likely would have chosen to learn that language before I started learning C.p  pIts beyond me why each and every C GUI programs tutorial for beginners arent written in the same style as the tutorials at a hrefhttpwww.techotopia.comindex.phpCSharpEssentialstechotopia.coma. I see no reason why C GUI programs tutorials for beginners cant be both crammed with basic facts AND explain even the simplest things to people like me, that need such explanations to understand a new subject. Well, there probably are such tuturials, only I havent found them.p  hr  pNow is the time, I think, to make a short list of what steps I have taken to get where I am today when it comes to computer skills in general and ability to write computer programs in particular. Im posting the list here for the benefit of people who wants to become good at writing computer programs but dont know how to reach that goal or have mislead themselves, as I have time and time again. Its not a final list in any way. Its just a short account of what have worked for me.p  pStep 1. Use lots of computer programs word processors, image editors and what else youre interested in to see what can be done with a computer.p  pStep 2. Write web pages with HTML and CSS. HTML, Hypertext Markupup Language, are used to tell browsers things like the beginning and end of paragraphs, the structure of tables and where to include images. CSS, Cascading Style Sheets, are used to add things like textsize and backgroundcolor to web pages.p  pStep 3. Improve your web pages with PHP. PHP, Hypertext Preprocessor, reminds of C and C and is a serverside scripting language. Serverside means that something is done to a web page before it is sent to a visitors browser, like adding code that makes it possible to send a message. PHP is easier for a beginner than C and C. Also, if you have written some HTML pages, you can gradually add PHP to these pages. In other words, you can learn how to use PHP in a familiar context.p  pStep 4. Learn C. Reminds of PHP and C. More difficult for a beginner than PHP but easier than C. This is where I am right now. These links may be of at least some usep  ul lia hrefhttpwww.codestore.netstore.nsfunidBLOG201006030518Quick And Dirty Guide To Migrating PHP Code To Cali lia hrefhttpwww.csharpstation.comTutorial.aspxC Station C Tutoriala on how to write console programsli lia hrefhttpdotnetperls.comdotnetperls.comali lia hrefhttpwww.syncfusion.comfaqwindowsformsDefault.aspxGeorge Shepherds Windows Forms FAQali lia hrefhttpwww.csharpcorner.comC Cornerali lia hrefhttpwww.csharpexamples.netexamplescsharpexamples.netexamplesa very short code snippetsli lia hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarykx37x36228vVS.9029.aspxVisual Ca at msdn.microsoft.com probably more useful when youre no longer an absolute beginner at least I think soli lia hrefhttpbeta.mkforlag.comengprojectscSharpSome basic C tutorialsa written by me and not amongst the best tutorials you can find however, I would have found a page similar to this one useful when I first started learning Cli ul  pStep 5. Learn C. Reminds of PHP and C. More difficult for a beginner than PHP and C. Allows the programmer to control more than C. Some people say its faster than C, while other people dont. This is where I hopefully will be within a year or so.p  pSince there are as many roads as there are budding programmers, these steps may not be right for you. Hopefully, though, the list above is of at least some assistence to you when you decide what steps to take to reach your goal.p  pIf you know more about programming than I do and disagree with the list above, feel free to provide your own list.

I can see from LogCat that the MediaPlayer is loading the stream and buffering, as I see the following messagesp  precodeAwesomePlayer  I  calling prefetchergtprepare AwesomePlayer  I  prefetcher is done preparing codepre  pBut my onPrepared method never gets called. If I add a timer and try to call play on the MediaPlayer at some point after I see the above log messages, the media players plays, so it is indeed entering into the Prepared state.p  pIf I replace the call to prepareAsync with prepare, the player just works. This is all on 2.2, which I have been reading seems to have some issues, but the problem Im having doesnt seem related, as the stream works fine when prepare is used.p  pI did notice that the ContentLength on the the stream is quite large 450MB, but since I can call play on the Media Player without getting an exception, it appears to be handling this OK.p  pThe only other change is that in the NPR app, the service is being bound to and the playback started from inside a View object while in my app, this happens inside an Activity.p  pAny thoughts on what I could be doing wrongp

Negative 9780 pI am not able to understand the meaning of the variable lowmemreserveratio by reading the explanation from Documentationsysctlvm.txt. I have also tried to google it but all the explanations found are exactly similar as present in vm.txt.p  pIt will be really helpful if sb explains it or mention some link about it. Here goes the original explanationp  precodeThe lowmemreserveratio is an array. You can see them by reading this file.   cat procsysvmlowmemreserveratio 256     256     32  Note  of this elements is one fewer than number of zones. Because the highest       zones value is not necessary for following calculation.  But, these values are not used directly. The kernel calculates  of protection pages for each zones from them. These are shown as array of protection pages in proczoneinfo like followings. This is an example of x8664 box. Each zone has an array of protection pages like this.   Node 0, zone      DMA   pages free     1355         min      3         low      3         high     4                       numaother   0         protection 0, 2004, 2004, 2004            pagesets     cpu 0 pcp 0           These protections are added to score to judge whether this zone should be used for page allocation or should be reclaimed.  In this example, if normal pages index2 are required to this DMA zone and watermark[WMARKHIGH] is used for watermark, the kernel judges this zone should not be used because pagesfree1355 is smaller than watermark  protection[2] 4  2004  2008. If this protection value is 0, this zone would be used for normal page requirement. If requirement is DMA zoneindex0, protection[0] 0 is used. zone[i]s protection[j] is calculated by following expression.  i lt j   zone[i]gtprotection[j]    total sums of presentpages from zone[i1] to zone[j] on the node      lowmemreserveratio[i] i  j    should not be protected.  0 i gt j    not necessary, but looks 0  The default values of lowmemreserveratio[i] are     256 if zone[i] means DMA or DMA32 zone     32  others. As above expression, they are reciprocal number of ratio. 256 means 1256.  of protection pages becomes about 0.39 of total present pages of higher zones on the node.  If you would like to protect more pages, smaller values are effective. The minimum value is 1 11 gt 100. codepre
Negative 9780 pI need to implement TabControllike behaviour with manual on event, on a button click for example pages switching and having all pages designed and implemented as separate forms. A form to be incorporated as a panel control inside main form and replaced by another form as needed.p  pHow to achieve thisp  pPS The reason why I dont want to use TabControl instead is because there are going to be too many tabs  Id prefer to present the list of them as a TreeView and instantiate on demand.

Negative 9780 pI have a question regarding createEmptyMovieClip in AS2. I have a flash file separated out into sections with labels and menu buttons which allow you to move you to the relevant framesection which contains the informationcontents relevant to that section. This works fine. What I cant work out is that if I manually put a movieclip on the stage in my about section and then add contents to it via AS2 then it only exists within the about us section. If I do it using createEmptyMovieClip within the actions for the about frame this works fine but it then always exists on every other frame of the project. I assume this is because it isnt actually creating it within this frame but I cant work out how to make it do this, even when i use this.createEmptyMovieClip it has exactly the same effect. I can obviously remove the movieclip completely each time a user moves to another frame that doesnt contain it but I dont want to do this as it contains a youtube video and leaving it means it doesnt have to be reloaded each time they come back.p  pI would be massively grateful if anyone could shed any light on this for me as I know im not getting how to place it correctly but im not sure how I should be doing itp  pThanks so much in advance,p  pDavep

Negative 9780 pI came across a question today of search efficiency for large sets today and Ive done by best to boil it down to the most basic case. I feel like this sort of thing probably relates to some classic problem or basic concept Im missing, so a pointer to that would be great.p  pSuppose I have a table definition likep  precodeCREATE TABLE foo     id int,     type bool,     reference int,     PRIMARY KEYid,     FOREIGN KEYreference REFERENCES fooid,     UNIQUE KEYreference  EngineInnoDB codepre  pPopulated with n rows where n2 are randomly assigned type1. Each row references another strongwith its same typestrong except for the first, which has referencenull.p  pNow we want to print all items with type 1. I assume that at some point, it will be faster to recursively call something likep  precodefunction printFoo1ref     ifrefnull         return     q  SELECT id, reference FROM foo WHERE id.ref     arr  mysqlfetcharray mysqlqueryq      echo arr[0]     printFoo1arr[1]  codepre  pAs opposed top  precodefunction printFoo2ref     q  SELECT id FROM foo WHERE type1     res  mysqlqueryq     while id  mysqlfetcharrayres          echo id[0]       codepre  pThe main point here being that function 1 searches for id, which is indexed, whereas function 2 has to make n2 comparisons that dont result in a hit, but that the overhead of multiple queries is going to be significantly greater than the single SELECT.p  pIs my assumption correct If so, how large of a data set would we need before function 1 outperforms function 2p

Negative 9780 pIve been banging my head against xsdID not allowing a colon  in an id attribute.  I first noticed this when using James Clarks nxmlmode in Emacs as it validated an XHTML file I was working with.  I then ran the XHTML file against the RNG provided with nxmlmode20041004 using Jing and received the following errorsp  precodeerror value of attribute id is invalid must be an XML name without colons codepre  pMost of the W3 pages Ive seen indicate that a colon is valid. Then I found this, a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgXMLxml19980210errataE98 relnofollowhttpwww.w3.orgXMLxml19980210errataE98a, which I take to mean you shouldnt use a colon in an id attribute, but you should be allowed to.

Negative 9780 pIm currently designing a system which handles the processing of different types of files.

If any of these checks fail an exception will the thrown to the controller, as the entire file is seen as invalid.p  pHowever once the top level validation has been successful the component will process each line in the file. From this point onwards it is acceptable for an individual line to fail processing i.e. validation, and the rest of the process to continue. p  pThis is where the problem lies, I am wondering if its best to log that validation errors have occurred and then throw an exception at the end of the process, or to change the ProcessFile signature to return an enum one of Processed, UnProcessed, ProcessedWithErrorsp  pFrom what I have read it seems that exceptions are the preferred route over status codes, however in this particular circumstance where a process can continue it seems wrong to use an artificial exception at the end to state the process did not complete 100.p  pI would be really interested in peoples thoughts on this.p

Negative 9780 pIm using codegittfscode, and I was wondering if it is possible to merge two TFS branches using codegittfscode. I have two branches MyCompanyDev amp MyCompanyRelease3.3. Release3.3 originates from the Dev branch. Both are checked out as different git repositories using git tfs.p  pId like to reincorporate the changes back into the Dev branch. Can this be achieved with codegittfscode or will I have to resort to trying to do it using TFS toolsp

Negative 9780 pi have a realy huge problem for me.  I display some tooth im my 3d Glscene World. The positions of the tooth are saved in an extra db and the program load this positions at start of the 3dscene. p  pAt the moment the camera style is perspective. But the problem is, if i rotate the scene the neare tooth nearer to the camera looks deformed.  i tried playing around with focallength but get no good results. p  pSo i decide to switch the camerastyle from perspective to orthogonal, this is the solution for my deforming problem, but now the positions of the tooth are wrong.  I know the position of the tooth did not change but the look of the tooth in the scene. p  pSo, my question is  Is there any way to convert the look of the perspective tooth to the orthogonal mode.  Here is an example of my problem.

You are nearly right, if i am playing around with the camera distance and i have no deformationen in perspective view if i create a long distance and edit the scalefactor of the whole scene. But now the back teeth looks like there are moved they arent moved. But the distance to the camera show it like this.  I am playing around with focallength but no result.  Is there some way to prevent the deformation in perspective view, without loosing my optical seetings you can see in the second image original viewbr [image with problem description] a hrefhttpwww.bilderhochladen.netfilesbigj3cp2c81e.jpg relnofollowhttpwww.bilderhochladen.netfilesbigj3cp2c81e.jpga p  pThanks a lot for all answers. p

Negative 9780 pIm basing this on performance characteristics Ive recently found out about codeDictionarycode, so Im using codeDictionarylttype, boolgtcode where the codeboolcode is ignored but supposedly I could use codeHashSetcode instead.p  pFor examplep  precodeDictionaryltbounds, boolgt overlap  class bounds      public float topleftx, toplefty, width, height      public bool equalbounds other              return upperleftx  width gt other.upperleftx ampamp         upperleftx lt other.upperleftx  other.width ampamp         upperlefty  height gt other.upperlefty ampamp         upperlefty lt other.upperlefty  other.height           public ... GetHashCode              ...       codepre  pHere Im not using equal to check for equality but instead for overlapping, which is bound to be annoying elsewhere but there is a reason why Im doing it.p  pIm presuming that if a value can be looked up from a key in O1 time then so can a key from itself.p  pSo I could presumably put thousands of bounds into overlap and do thisp  precodeoverlap.ContainsKeynew bounds... codepre  pTo find out in O1 time if a given bound overlaps any others from the collection.p  pId also like to know what happens if I change the x, y position of a bound, presumably its like removing and then adding it into the set again performance wise, very expensivep  pWhat do I put into the GetHashCode functionp  pstronggoalstrongp  pIf this works then Im after using this sort of mechanism to find out what other bounds a given bound overlaps.p  pVery few bounds move in this system and no new ones are added after the collection has been populated. Newly added bounds need to be able to overlap old ones.p  pstrongconclusionstrongp  pSee the feedback below for more details.p  pIn summary its not possible to achieve the O1 performance because, unlike the default equals, a check for overlapping is not transitive.p  pAn interval tree however is a good solution.p

Negative 9780 pI wrote an implementation for a priority queue I needed, and now I would like to test it.

Quite often i make a single branch the new treeby setting a child of the root as the root, so the rest of my tree become garbage.p  pIm wondering if it is better to let the garbage collector do his work i suggest him to start collecting with System.gc when i change the tree root or implement my own pool for TreeNodes, and when i change the root, recycle all the now useless nodes.p  pThe answer can be read as is the android garbage collector very optimized or is it preferable to limiting the creationdestruction of object, even if this is quite consumingi would need to traverse all the tree, and append each useless node to a stack for my poolp  pI read that android GC is not as evolvedit basically runs when you have low memory.

Negative 9780 pI have an 8 bit digital output board used for device controlling. Each external device needs one bit and is controlled by a different application. I have written a class library and the class DigitalOutputPort VB 2010  that envelopes the driver that manages the 8 bit port. Each device application uses this class, creating its own instance.p  pIn order to set a bit of the digital output port, I have to write a byte to that port this byte is the bit mask for all 8 bits together to set HIGH the bit number 0  1  2, I have to write 7 on the port, to set HIGH all 8 bits, I have to write 256, and so on...p  pAll works fine when only ONE application uses the class. But if two applications want to set its own bit on that port, I get problems because I do not know the current value of all bits set by other applications the driver has not such function and, of course, I cannot change one bit without changing all the other if I do not know the current bit maskp  pNormally this looks like a typical case of sharing data between two application and my first idea was to write the current value of the port in a file on the disc, where all application can access and read it. But it seems to be too much heavy for this simple problem. Moreover it could also creates performance ans reliability problem.p  pThen I though about using a shared field property in the class. A shared field preserves its value between all instances of a class but is it also true between instances from different applications I cannot find more info about this last point, I have to make same test.p  pA third way would be that I create just only ONE instance of the class DigitalOutputPort, one for all applications. The first application that needs it, create the object, all other applications will used the already created object. I like more than other this way, but I do not know if and how it can be done.p  pWhich should be the right approach in your opinionp  pThank you for replying.p
Negative 9780 pI have a C application that needs to get variablelength data passed back from a C DLL. Typically I solve this problem as follows for each entity type such as a string or a bitmap I have a persistent C variable of the appropriate type. The C app then calls something like QueryBitmapByNamestring bitmapName, and the contract is that C must process this variable before it calls another function in the C DLL. This has always worked in the past, but I have recently hit a stumbling block I dont understand when returning multiple bitmaps.

Negative 9780 pi am very new to coding so forgive my hopefully simple question.p  pI am attempting to implement media queries into a website to make it fully responsive and despite following numerous tutorials seem to be having a very basic problem that is no doubt easily solved but a mystery to me due to my inexperience.p  pThe site is built using the 960 grid system, below you can find my media queries css page.p  pBasically, i can get the media queries to work, in so much as when for example the browser is reduced to 960px or less, the site reacts correctly to the media query css page becomes  width 94 and left right margins of 3  but as the page continues to be resized, it isnt fluid and doesnt follow the browser edge. It stays at 960px basically, rather than scaling down until the next media query 650px is triggered. Widthauto seems to not be working, as currently the media queries only resize the page when the width is set at percentages or pixels etc for each resolution.p  pBelow is the css and html, again please forgive my presumably novice coding, this is my first site.p  pMany thanks ]p  precodemedia screen and maxwidth 960px    .container12  width 94  margin 0 3 0 3   header  width 100  .grid10 alpha omega  width78        media screen and maxwidth 650px    header  width auto  .grid10 alpha omega  width auto          media screen and maxwidth 480px     header  width auto  .grid10 alpha omega  width auto        codepre  pHTMLp  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN           httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt  lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt ltheadgt ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetutf8 gtltmeta    nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth gt lttitlegttitlelttitlegt   ltlink hrefhttpfonts.googleapis.comcssfamilyQuicksand400,700 relstylesheet typetextcssgt  ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefreset.css gt ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss href960.css gt ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefstyles.css gt ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefmediaqueries.css gt    ltheadgt ltbodygt   ltdiv classcontainer12 idcontainergt ltdiv idheadergt ltdiv classgrid2 alpha idlogogt lth1gtlta hrefgtHomeltagtlth1gtltdivgt  ltdiv classgrid3  omega idnavigationgt ltul classnavigationgt  ltligtlta hrefmenu1gtmenu 1ltagtltligt  ltligtlta hrefmenu2gtmenu 2ltagtltligt  ltulgt ltdivgt    ltdivgt ltdiv classgrid10 alpha omega idmaincontentgt lth2gthellolta hrefmenu1.html classh2boldgt world.ltagt Lorem Ipsum.lth2gt ltpgtLorem Ipsum.ltbrgt Lorem Ipsum.ltpgt   ltdivgt ltdivgt  ltbodygt  lt[if lt IE 9]gt ltscript srchttpcss3mediaqueriesjs.googlecode.comsvntrunkcss3mediaqueries.jsgtltscriptgt lt[endif]gt  lthtmlgt codepre  pUPDATE this is my main styles.css, as it seems the problem hasnt been possible to replicate with what i provided.p  precodecharset utf8  CSS Document    Page Styles   body      backgroundcolordeeee9    .container12   backgroundcolorfefefe    p  fontfamilyVerdana, Geneva, sansserif fontsize10px lineheight 18px    p alink  textdecorationnone fontweightbold color000000    p ahover  textdecorationnone fontweightbold colorfa5e45    p avisited  textdecorationnone fontweightbold color333    h2  padding 120px 0 13px 0 fontsize23px fontfamily Quicksand, sansserif letterspacing 1px fontweight100   h3  padding 0 0 3px 0 fontsize19px fontfamily Quicksand, sansserif letterspacing 1px fontweight100    h2 alink    fontfamily Quicksand, sansserif color000000 textdecorationnone fontweightbold    h2 ahover   fontfamily Quicksand, sansserif colorfa5e45 textdecorationnone       Header   header   height 100px  marginbottom 120px  borderbottom 1px dashed    logo     textindent9999px   logo a   display block  margintop15px  border none  background transparent urlimageslogo.png  norepeat  width 76px  height 76px  borderimage initial     navigation   floatright    .navigation   margin 0  padding 0  liststyletype none  float right     .navigation li   margin 0  padding 0  display inline  float left    .navigation alink  textdecorationnone color 000000    .navigation ahover  textdecorationnone color fa5e45    .navigation a   margintop 30px width 100px height 47px border none lineheight 47px float right fontfamily Quicksand, sansserif letterspacing 1px texttransform uppercase fontsize 14px textalign right textdecoration none       Homepage       maincontent p  fontfamily Quicksand, sansserif fontsize19px lineheight 24px letterspacing 1px   maincontent p alink    fontfamily Quicksand, sansserif color000000 textdecorationnone  fontweightbold   maincontent p ahover      fontfamily Quicksand, sansserif colorfa5e45 textdecorationnone       menu 1   .workwrapper  displayblock clearboth    .workwrapper p paddingtop13px    .workurl  fontfamilyVerdana, Geneva, sansserif fontsize10px     .workurl a fontfamilyVerdana, Geneva, sansserif fontsize10px fontweight bold textdecorationnone colorfa5e45    .workurlnull  fontfamilyVerdana, Geneva, sansserif fontsize10px     .workurlnull a fontfamilyVerdana, Geneva, sansserif fontsize10px fontweight bold textdecorationnone color999     .workexample   floatright    .image  paddingbottom 40px positionrelative floatright textalignright     menu2   .multicolumn1   mozcolumncount2  Firefox  webkitcolumncount2  Safari and Chrome  columncount   .aboutimg  paddingtop 30px   aboutimg2  padding 30px 4px 0 4px   codepre

Negative 9780 pIve been trying to implement the HashCash algorithm in Go For those of you who dont know  p  blockquote   pHashCash is a method to stop spam. Basically, a header is constructed of some environment variables known both to the client and server email, timestamp etc.. A random nonce is appended to the end of the header. The client tries to bruteforce a partial hash collision e.g. where the first emxem bits are 0 by changing the nonce. p      pHashCash works because its not as expensive to find strongpartialstrong hash collisions. When the server receives this header, they verify the information in it so it can be used only for one session and compute the resulting hash. If the first emxem bits are 0, then a good amount of time has been expended on the clients machine, computing the collision which wouldnt happen on a spambotp blockquote  pFor me, Im just wanting to write a program which finds the time it takes for a client to find a partial hash collision of emxem bits. p  pI wrote this code which will return truefalse if the emint64em has a hash collision of emxem bits.p  precodefunc partialAllZeroes zeroCount uint8, val int64 bool, os.Error      setBitString  1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111     unsetBitString  0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000     setBitString  setBitString[0zeroCount1]     unsetBitString  unsetBitString[0zeroCount1]      zeroTest, e  strconv.Btoi64setBitString, 2  64 0bits     zeroes, e    strconv.Btoi64unsetBitString, 2  64 1bits      if e  nil          return false, e          result  val amp zeroTest     switch          case result  zeroes             return true, nil         case result  zeroes             return false, nil           return false, os.NewError  codepre  pMy current problem is Im having alot of type conversion issues. For example, I am only able to operate on the emint64em type, because thats what emstrconv.Btoi64em returns. Another issue that Im also looking at is that the hash function returns as a byte array, and I have no idea how to convert that into an emint64em. p  pBelow is my current hash code  p  precodehasher  sha1.New baseCollisionString  BASE COLLISION STRING nonce  12345 hasher.Write[]bytestrings.JoinbaseCollisionString, nonce testCollision  hasher.Sum  Somehow I must convert the first x bits of testCollision into an int64 type, so I can use partialAllZeroes with it codepre

Negative 9780 pI am using a standard grouped style UITableView that returns a custom header view for one of its sections using the tableViews delegate method viewForHeaderInSection. The view that is returned for the section header contains a control. It displays an image and is a control so it can tapped to let the user change the image. My desired UI is similar to the photo for a contact in the Apple Contacts app a floating imageViewlike control in a grouped style table. p  pThe problem Id like to solve is that touches on the tableView section header go straight to the control. Id like the table to get a chance to determine if the touch is actually the beginning of a scroll gesture. If not, then the table can pass the event to the section header view for processing. p  pThis is how all the rows in the table behave since I have delaysContentTouches for the table on. I suspect the problem is because the section header view is not in the tables view hierarchy. So everything is probably working per spec. just not the way I want. p  pstrongI want the section header view to behave regarding touches just like rows do table gets first chance to process.strongp  pBTW I am not placing this control in a table row which would solve the problem because I want the rounded rect grouped style for all table rows, but not for this one UI element. This control is in the center of my table header for section 1 which is why I want drags on it to scroll the table.p

Negative 9780 pIm in the processing of moving over a mysql database to a postgres database.

Both databases were generated by Djangos syncdb, although the postgres db is more or less empty at the moment. I tried to migrate the tables over using Djangos built in dumpdata  loaddata functions and its serializers, but it doesnt seem to like a lot of my tables, leading me to believe that writing a manual solution might be best in this case. I have code to verify that the column headers are the same for each table in the database and that the matching tables exist that works fine. I was thinking it would be best to just grab the mysql data row by row and then insert it into the respective postgres table row by row Im not concerned with speed atm. The one thing is, I dont know whats the proper way to construct the insert statement. I have something likep  precodetablename  retrievetable columnheaders  getheaderstablename can return a tuple or a list postgrescursor  postgrescon.cursor rows  mysqlcursor.fetchall       for row in rows row is a tuple    postgrescursor.execute codepre  pWhere  would be the insert statement. I just dont know what the proper way is to construct it. I have the table name that I would like to insert into as a string, I have the column headers that I can treat as a list, tuple, or string, and I have the respective values that Id like to insert. What would be the recommended way to construct the statement I have read the documentation on a hrefhttpinitd.orgpsycopgdocsusage.html relnofollowpsycopgs documentation pagea and I didnt quite see the way that would satisfy my needs. I dont know or think this is the entirely correct way to properly migrate, so if someone could steer me in the correct way or offer any advice Id really appreciate it.p

In example  M1 should connect through N1 M2 should connect throught N3 M3 should connect through N5 M4 should connect through N6 M5 should connect throught N7p  pand the rest gateways should be available.p  pBetween the machines and the gateways should be a server that forwards each machines traffic to the correct gateway.

Negative 9780 pThe tests at my new job are nothing like the tests I have encountered before.p  pWhen theyre writing their unit tests presumably before the code, they create a class starting with When. The name describes the scenario under which the tests will run the fixture. Theyll created subclasses for each branch through the code. All of the tests within the class start with should and they test different aspects of the code after running. So, they will have a method for verifying that each mock DOC is called correctly and for checking the return value, if applicable. I am a little confused by this method because it means the exact same execution code is being run for each test and this seems wasteful. I was wondering if there is a technique similar to this that they may have adapted. A link explaining the style and how it is supposed to be implemented would be great. I sounds similar to some approaches of BDD Ive seen.p  pI also noticed that theyve moved the repeated calls to execute the SUT into the setup methods. This causes issues when they are expecting exceptions, because they cant use builtin tools for performing the check Python unittests assertRaises. This also means storing the return value as a backing field of the test class. They also have to store many of the mocks as backing fields. Across class hierarchies it becomes difficult to tell the configuration of each mock.p  pThey also test code a little differently. It really comes down to what they consider an integration test. They mock out anything that steals the context away from the function being tested. This can mean private methods within the same class. I have always limited mocking to resources that can affect the results of the test, such as databases, the file system or dates. I can see some value in this approach. However, the way it is being used now, I can see it leading to fragile tests tests that break with every code change. I get concerned because without an integration test, in this case, you could be using a 3rd party API incorrectly but your unit tests would still pass. Id like to learn more about this approach as well.p  pSo, any resources about where to learn more about some of these approaches would be nice. Id hate to pass up a great learning opportunity just because I dont understand they way they are doing things. I would also like to stop focusing on the negatives of these approaches and see where the benefits come in.p
Negative 9780 pAfter looking around a bit, I couldnt find an answer to this question, though I suspect its been asked before.  The closest I could find is this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9080584functionpointersinobjectsFunction pointers in objectsa though it doesnt get quite what Im after.p  pSuppose we have a piece of code like thisp  precodevar foo  function    some code   codepre  pnow, Im assuming that during evaluation time the name foo is bound in its environment to an internal representation of the function, that is then looked up during application time.p  pNow suppose we have , a little later in the program, an objectp  precodevar obj   obj.func  foo codepre  pAt this point, there should be two copies of the same function object in the environment, one bound to foo, the other bound to obj.func.  But lets say I dont want two copies of that function, but rather have obj.func point back towards foois there a way to do this This is what Ive come up withp  precodevar obj   obj.func  function   foo  codepre  pWould this work  Is there a better wayp  pMany thanksp  pstrongEDIT FOR CLARIFICATIONstrongp  pApologiesI dont think I was being clear enough.  I hope this helps.p  pIm not sure how the Javascript evaluation process works, but lets say it keeps track of some internally represented environment, which well represent abstractly here as a set of key value pairs.p  pNow, when the evaluator sees some code such as p  precodevar foo  function    some code    codepre  pit constructs this in its environment [foo  [function object]].  And then, later on, when it sees something like thisp  precodevar bar  foo codepre  pit looks up foo in the environment to retrieve its value, a function object, and then augments the environment like so. [foo  [function object], bar  [function object]]. Now the same function really is there twice in the environment.  Is this how javascript sets up its environment  If not, then how does it do sop  pMy motivation for asking is as follows.  Lets say we define some functions, and then later an object that we export that functions as an interface to those functions, and which we know were going to instantiate many times.  It would be more efficient if the object contained pointers to functions, rather than the functions themselves.p

Negative 9780 pOk, so I have a bit of a quandry... First, allow me to describe what I am doingp  pI have a plugin for Sketchup that I have created.  This plugin consists of some Ruby scrips that need to be installed into the Sketchup directory, there is no actual app just these Ruby files.  On the PC, I have created an executable installer that automatically takes these files and installs them in the correct directory, and has an update service that notifies the user of updates, and can push them if the user chooses to accept.p  pOn the Mac, I have to take the same few Ruby files and have them copied into the LibrayApplication SupportGoogleSketchup 8plugins folder.p  pPrevious to Mountain Lion, I had created a Package Installer to accomplish this.  It worked nicely, although because my package didnt contain an App I was not able to use any of the third party update services for Mac to push updates...p  pSo now, fast forward to Mountain Lion.  Package Maker is no longer included in XCode, while you can still get it from Apple, its clear to me that in the near future they dont want people using it.  They want Apps and they want them in their app store.p  pI agree with them, and I WANT to be in the Mac App store.  Itll get me good exposure, and I can push updates.p  pHere is the problem I am seeing, my plugin is a plugin for Sketchup, its not an app, not even an official Mac Plugin its literally a couple of Ruby files that need to go into the Sketchup directly we do the rest in the cloudp  pAnother hurdle I rand into is that my package isnt signed so its hard for Mountain Lion users to install it unless they know there way around the Security pane.p  pSo heres the big questionp  pWith the move towards sandboxing apps on Mac, and the Mac App Store, is my Sketchup plugin going to be rendered useless unless its an App  With app sandboxing, will dumping files into the Application Support directory even be allowedp  pThese may be elementary questions, but I am a Sketchup guy, not a Mac developer, so any help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 9780 pI have a specific Adobe CQ5 5.5 content template that authors will use to create pages.  I want to exclude any page that is created from this template from the dispatcher cache.  As I understand it currently, the only way I know to prevent caching is to configure strongdispatcher.anystrong to emnotem cache a particular URL.  But in this case, the URL isnt known until a web author uses the template to create a page.  I dont want to have to go back and modify dispatcher.any every time a page is createdor at least I want to automate this if there is no other way.  I am using IIS for the dispatcher.  The reason I dont want to cache the pages is because the underlying JSPs that render the content for these pages produce dynamic content, and the pages dont use querystrings and wont carry authentication headers.  The pages will be created in unpredictable directories, so I dont know the URL pattern ahead of time.p  pstrongHow can I configure things so that emanyem page that is created from a certain template will be automatically excluded from the dispatcher cachestrongp  pIt seems like CQ ought to have some mechanism to respect HTTP responsecaching headers.

This one for example needs  codecode to be emtwoem parameters.  Could it be passed in as codeobjectcode somehow  I have a feeling it could be possible, but if so it needs some real reflection magic.p

Negative 9780 pIm writing a rich JS application, Id like broad advice as to how to structure the JSPHP. Im not sure how to split up this question, sorry if its asking too many things. Im suffering from information overloadp  pI expect the JS will requests JSON objects from a single PHP file. Id like a minimal but effective pattern for PHP to respond to requests that is concise and effective. Perhaps the JS would invoke modellike objects which query a database and return JSON to the client. p  pWhat would be a good pattern for the PHP side Ive hacked together a PHP file which messily has a large switch statement parsing for instructions from the client, with associated data. A single request could contain multiple instructions. For example, javascript sends a requestp  precode.ajax     url ajax.php, dataType json,     data instructions [         instruction newPerson,         data               name person.name,              email person.email              city person.city              ],     success callback, error ajaxFail  codepre  pThe callback would be a global handler dealing with any objects the PHP returns, from this request or others. For example, the above might receive a new person object with the person ID generated by PHP inserting into the DB, as well as a city object also with its ID. Other requests might also return those objects, so a single handler makes sense One question would be how the javascript associates the returned objects with the insertion submittedp  pIm ashamed by my PHP page code, but it looks something like thisp  precodereturn  array instructions  REQUEST[instructions] foreach instructions as instruction     switchinstruction[instruction]         case findPoeple             data  instruction[data]             res  DBqueryselect player from person where player like .

Can anyone point me to concise patterns specifically demonstrating this kind of approach for JSPHP that uses OOP to implement this in a respectable way p  pMVC made sense to me until rich JS apps became possible, the boundaries seem very blurred, any enlightenment would be a god send, Im starting from scratch here now.p  pThank youp
Negative 9780 pMy first question on stackoverflow, so my apologies if Im missing something.p  pI read in a reply in another J2ME transparency question from 2009 here at stackoverflow that You should note that alpha is sometimes ignored on some implementations and sometimes quantized to ugly levels Some motorola phones snap alpha values to the nearest 2bit value.p  pI am currently experimenting with transparency in J2ME, testing on rather new devices at least in the J2ME world.p  pThey all return 256 when I call Display.numAlphaLevelsp  pYet, I only count max 8 actual levels and mostly only 5 I can tell apart when I set an image to slowly fade in. And it seems it is, as the above quote states, the nearest 2bit value 1 visible at level 23 3 visible at level 47 6 visible at level 816 12 visible at level 1631 25 visible at level 3263 50 visible at level 64127 100 visible at level 128255p  pTested on Sony Ericsson Aino, Vivaz, and a Nokia N8, with both an 8bit PNG and a 24bit PNG. I consider those devices to be some of the latest models that can run J2ME.p  pThe above quote makes it sound like its not all J2ME enabled phones that behaves like this though. And thats why I ask my questionp  pCan anyone confirm that this is just how alphalevels are with J2ME enabled phones If not, then how is it set up on other phones, and which phones are they Do you know of any J2ME enabled phone that actually have all the 256 levels Or one that can give e.g. 75 visibilityp  pThanksp
Negative 9780 pUsing CentOS 6p  pI have 2 Apache httpd services running. The first one provides REST interfaces and a UI to manage the operating system startstop services, execute system command using suid, modify system settings, etc.. This httpd service running on port 5555 will only be accessible from a certain ip range firewall since it will be used for administrative purposes.p  pThe second httpd service port 80 and 443 will be visible on the Internet. It will serve a web application to external customers.p  pThe first httpd needs selinux policies that give it more access to the OS filesprocesses. The second needs selinux policies that are strict to what it is allowed to do within its context. The second needs to be this way for better web application security and prevent any web app exploits from even being able to touch the OS.p  pBoth of the httpd processes are running as different users.p  ol liCan selinux be used with 2 different sets of policies for the same httpd executableli liHow do Iis it possible to set the httpd process context to switch to another set of policies when httpd startsli liIs it just a matter of making a copy of the httpd binary and change its selinux context that uses all new policies relabel the httpd binary, but Im sure it will take more than thisli liWhat are the steps to copy the existing httpd selinux settings to a new nameli ol  pI think this comes down to needing a httpdpublic and httpdprivate selinux context.

Negative 9780 pI have a project that is built using the MasterDetail template for the iPad.  When it was developed using iOS 5.0, it was easy to update the popoverview by just adjusting the view controller inside the popover by doing ex p  precodeself.contentSizeForViewInPopover  GCRect500.0, 500.0 codepre  pThis would take the default popoverview that is displayed and make it much wider, so that I could fit more content on the screen on less rows.p  pHowever, once I checked on iOS 6, I noticed that the actual popoverview is completely different, and looks more like a sliderover view, as once you click the button at the top, the popoverview now slides over from the left hand side to the right and the size isnt updated anymore.  What do I need to do to get this slider to be widerp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHZBd1.png altenter image description herep
Negative 9780 pSo basically, my problem is that I have a speech signal in .wav format that is corrupted by a harmonic noise source at some frequency. My goal is to identify the frequency at which this noise occurs, and use a notch filter to remove said noise. So far, I have read the speech signal into matlab usingp  precode[data, Fs]  wavreadsignal.wav codepre  pMy question is how can I identify the frequency at which the harmonic noise is occurring, and once Ive done that, how can I go about implementing a notch filter at that frequencyp  pNOTE I do not have access to the iirnotch command or fdesign.notch due to the version of MATLAB I am currently using 2010.p

Negative 9780 pI am re factoring a project and part of what I am doing is replacing inline SQL with calls to stored procedures. I have run into an issue. I am using PHP version 5.3.5 and MySQL version 5.0.7p  pThe project has members, members can have requests. I want to get all requests for a specific member and return them as an array of Request objects. p  pI have created a static method that calls a stored proc that returns all request ids, which I in turn use to instantiate new Request objects. The problem is I am getting an errror regarding unbuffered queries, here is the errorp  precodeGeneral error 2014 Cannot execute queries while other unbuffered queries are active. Consider using PDOStatementfetchAll. Alternatively, if your code is only ever going to run against mysql, you may enable query buffering by setting the PDOMYSQLATTRUSEBUFFEREDQUERY attribute   codepre  pI have done as the error message suggested and used fetchAll but I am still gettting this problem. Here is a simplified version of the relevant PHPp  precodeclass Request      public function constructrequestid              as you can see this is still inline          db  Databasegetinstance         sql  SELECT field1,field2,field3 FROM requests WHERE requestid           stmt  dbgtpreparesql         stmtgtexecutearrayrequestid         row  stmtgtfetchPDOFETCHASSOC         ifemptyrow                      populate properties             foreachrow as keygtvalue                              thisgtkey  value                                      public static function getrequestsbymemberidmemberid              array to hold results         requests  array         this is just a PDO object         db  Databasegetinstance         sql  CALL getrequestsbymemberid         stmt  dbgtpreparesql         bind the param          stmtgtbindParam1,memberid,PDOPARAMINT,10         stmtgtexecute         iterate through adding new Request objects to the array                foreachstmtgtfetchAllPDOFETCHASSOC as row                      here is where the problem occurs             requests[]  new selfrow[requestid]                   return requests            codepre  pAnd a simplified version of my stored procp  precodedelimiter   CREATE PROCEDURE getrequestsbymemberidmemberidin INT BEGIN     SELECT requestid      FROM requests       WHERE cr.memberid  memberidin END delimiter   codepre  pAs I noted above the problem occurs when I try to instantiate a new Request to add to the array. This appears to cause the cursor problem that I am seeing however because I used fetchAll should that not resolve the problem Is there a best practice for handing this type of scenario Any advice would be very much appreciated. Thanks muchp
Negative 9780 pI am creating an app that has photo sharing, and I am trying to add in the functionality to mention or tag users. Twitter is what originally starting using  with a username to tag users but now everything from Facebook to Instagram is using it. Is this something that is implemented on the iOS side or in the back end I am currently programming the back end in Django, but for some reason I think this would be accomplished on the iOS end. There is surprisingly very little information out their on how to mention users in either Django or iOS.p  pBasically, when creating a post, Id like to create a user mention by typing  followed by a username with no spaces between which would display their name in the post like this username which would be clickable, leading back to that users profile. If I am unclear in any way with my question please let me know. Any help, such as pointing me in the right direction of where to start with something like this, would be much appreciated. Thanks p
Negative 9780 pWhats the best practice in NHibernate to delete an object by id. You can do bothp  precodepublic void Deleteint id       Session.Deletenew MyEntity  Id  id   codepre  pOr you could dop  precodepublic void Deleteint id       var entity  Session.GetltMyEntitygtid     Session.Deleteentity  codepre  pThe second option feels cleaner to me, because youre not composing a new object just for deletion, but on the other hand youll execute two SQL commands, instead of one.p

Negative 9780 pIm working on a Java EE web application where I use Spring MVC and Spring security. Until now, I succeeded in implementing the common security features using a custom userService which retrieves the information from my database but Im now facing a new security issue and I dont really know whats the best way to tackle it...p  pHere is what I need to do Users who are authenticated in my app are allowed to navigate through their projects but should only be able to open the projects they have authorizations to and open what is inside but no other project. p  pMy current implementation deals with it with the navigation user interface offering only the list of the authorized projects to the user. However if a clever user directly edits the URL to open a project with another id then no authorization test on the project id and the user is done so that it opens the project without trouble.p  pSo, what I would like to add is a control on every requests for opening a project or something inside it. This control will test if the project id requested can be opened by the current user or not. If not, it will return to the user an access denied page. This control is easy to implement in itself but as it is a bit of code which could be in many methods of my app I would like to find the cleanest way to do it p  pWhat do you think is the best way to implement that  I considered several possibilities but I need advicep  p1 Use servlet filters p  p2 Add a special access on Spring security with a custom authenticationManager  something like p  precode ltsecurityintercepturl patternopen accesscanOpen gt  codepre  pbut Im not sure how to define this and if I would be able to get the parameters coming from the original request...p  p3 Use Aspect Oriented Programming  but I read somewhere that it does not work on controller callsp  p4 Use Spring interceptors p  p5 other ideas p  pThanks in advance for you helpp

If anyones interested in this, what I do is to replace my service reference with a RhinoMocks Mock object.

If I were to attempt to create one by hardcoding all the property values by hand then this would probably take me the best part of a whole day.p  pHowever, what I can very easily do is to capture the XML serialized response from this service.  I could then easily edit its values and store this XML in one of my unit tests.  p  pWhat Im after is an easy way to then deserialize this test XML into a response object and use this to program the response from my Stub.p  pAny help would be much appreciated.p  pThanksp  pGriffp

Negative 9780 pI am required to develop a program that takes as input a text file java source code and checks the codes against the syntax rules for java.  Following that, the program should underline the SYNTAX errors present in the original source code and provide a new version of the code with the errors solved.

It contains the rules for the java language and stuff but i have no idea of how to use it. I have vainly tried to look for some online tutorials.

In the jquery mobile listview docs they state the following p  blockquote   pNote that the refresh method only affects new nodes appended to a list. This is done for performance reasons. Any list items already enhanced will be ignored by the refresh process. This means that if you change the contents or attributes on an already enhanced list item, these wont be reflected. emIf you want a list item to be updated, replace it with fresh markup before calling refresh.emp blockquote  pShould I repopulate the whole list every time I edit one item or is there any way to programmatically replace the listitem codeltligtcode with fresh markupp  pRight now I am getting the index of the listitem that is clicked and removing it, creating an new one, and inserting it at the right position and then refreshing the listview with ul.listviewrefresh.p  pTanks,br  Johnp

I want the database to change view and show me that members details.p  pAll the online guides Ive found online only talk about the Edit and Delete key.p  pA picture showing my database in VS10. a hrefhttpi46.tinypic.comszznmq.png relnofollowhttpi46.tinypic.comszznmq.pngap
Negative 9780 pOn a distributed Hadoop cluster, can I copy the same hdfssite.xml file to the namenodes and datanodes p  pSome of the setup instructions Ive seen i.e. Cloudera say to have the dfs.data.dir property in this file on the datanodes and and the dfs.name.dir property in this file on the namenode.  Meaning I should have two copies of hdfssite.xml, one for the namenode and one for the datanodes.p  pBut if its all the same Id rather just ownmaintain one copy of the file and push it to ALL nodes anytime I change it. Is there any harmrisk in having both dfs.name.dir and dfs.data.dir properties in the same file  What issues might happen if a data node sees the property for dfs.name.dir  And if there are issues, what other properties should be in the hdfssite.xml file on the namenode but not on datanode and vice versa.p  pAnd finally, what properties need to be included in the hdfssite.xml file that I copy to a client machine who isnt a tasktracker or datanode, but just talks to the Hadoop cluster p  pIv searched around, including the Oreilly operations book, but cant find any good article describing how the config file needs to differ across different nodes. Thanksp

Negative 9780 pstrongEDIT Please read my answer below first, before you decide to read and try to understand the text below. You may not find its worth it when you see what was going on strongp  pI have a weird problem SQL Server 2008 R2 keeps complaining about an invalid column that is indeed not there anymore, but Im not using it eitherp  pI cant update any rows in that table anymore from within my own application, where no reference to the column can be found, because I always get this error now. I then wanted to update straight in SSMS as a test, but when I edit the rows there, I still get this error.p  pWhat happened before I made a column called CertcUL varchar1, and that worked. After a while it appeared I needed it to be a varchar30, so I edited the table design and turned it into a varchar30.p  pFrom that moment I saw that I could only update this column when I stored 1 character. When I tried to store more, I got an error warning me about string or binary truncation. So somehow, the previous varchar1 info was still present in the DB.p  pWhen I renamed that column to CertcUL2 or CertcUL, the same things kept happening So changing the column name does not change the underlying cause. Also when just trying to add some characters straight in SSMS.p  pWhen I deleted the column, and added a new one with varchar30 straight away, and called test, the same problem remained This column still only allows me to store one character The column was the one but last column. Making it the last column does not help either. Only when creating an new column while keeping the other column, I can have columns that behave properly.p  pSo somehow, SQL Server saves some meta data about a column, even when it has been deleted. And does not look at the name, but rather at the order in which the columns are created.p  pDoes anyone have an idea how this can happen, and how I can fix this besides probably dropping and recreating the whole tablep  pThanksp

Negative 9780 pIm trying to learn ASP.NET MVC programming. Ive been using default MVC 4 mobile application template for my experiments. At some point Ive decided to update the scripts to their latest versions from 1.1.1 to 1.2.0 in case of jqeurymobile. For some reason the styling of the page is now gone. I know that this has nothing to do with my changes since Im pretty much made none, so it has to be solely due to update. I was wondering if someone could point out to me what should I look at in order to figure out this problem, because honestly, at the moment Im completely lost and dont even have a clue where to start looking or how to debug these kinds of problems. Theres just too many magic strings in this template for me to wrap my head around.p

Negative 9780 pI currently have 2 different sections for this program, the first half takes the users input from a web page and then transfers it over onto a PHP side which will access MySQL and display the requested information.p  pExample If I enter AX12 for the ID it will display information for that ID which does infact exist, but if I enter AX13 which doesnt it will display blank information, so Im wondering if someone can show me how I can validate this once the information has been transferred over onto the PHP side. So if it detects that the information youve submitted does not exist simply display a message saying ID DOES NOT EXIST or something along those lines.p  pHeres the code for the PHP side if you need it for more information.p  precodeltphp  partnumber  GET[txtInput] partdescription unitsonhand itemclass warehousenumber unitprice  query resultset connection record  echo lthtmlgt echo ltheadgt echo lttitlegtSQL Applicationlttitlegt echo ltstyle type  textcssgtbodytextalign center backgroundcolor CC3333 color 660000 fontsize 30ltstylegt echo ltheadgt echo ltbodygt  echo ltcentergtlth1gtSQL Applicationlth1gtltcentergt  echo ltbr gt echo ltbr gt echo ltbr gt  connection  mysqlconnectlocalhost,mstanicic,         or die nn PROBLEM CONNECTING TO DATABASE n . mysqlerror . nn  mysqlselectdbmstanicicdb  query  select  from part where partnumber   . partnumber .   resultset  mysqlqueryquery         or die nn PROBLEM WITH QUERY . n . mysqlerror . nn  record  mysqlfetchassocresultset  ifpartnumber              else          partdescription  record[partdescription]         unitsonhand  record[unitsonhand]         itemclass  record[itemclass]         warehousenumber  record[warehousenumber]         unitprice  record[unitprice]          echo ltcentergt         echo lttable border1 width400 style tablelayoutfixed cellpadding5 cellspacing0gt         echo ltcol width  200gt         echo ltcol width  200gt         echo lttrgt         echo ltth colspan2gtDETAILS OF THE PART YOU REQUESTEDltthgt         echo lttrgt         echo lttrgt         echo lttdgtpartdescriptionlttdgt         echo lttdgt . partdescription . lttdgt         echo lttrgt         echo lttrgt         echo lttdgtunitsonhandlttdgt         echo lttdgt . unitsonhand . lttdgt         echo lttrgt         echo lttrgt         echo lttdgtitemclasslttdgt         echo lttdgt . itemclass . lttdgt         echo lttrgt         echo lttrgt         echo lttdgtwarehousenumberlttdgt         echo lttdgt . warehousenumber . lttdgt         echo lttrgt         echo lttrgt         echo lttdgtunitpricelttdgt         echo lttdgt . unitprice . lttdgt         echo lttrgt         echo lttablegt         echo ltcentergt          mysqlcloseconnection   echo ltbr gt echo ltbr gt echo ltbr gt  echo ltinput type  button value  RETURN style  width 75px height 75px onclick  javascriptwindow.location.href  jdpset14.htmlgt  echo ltbodygt echo lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 9780 pWorklight 5.0.6.1p  pWe are having a specific requirement from our client about using a PCI Appliance from Intel a hrefhttpinfo.intel.comrsintelimagesIntelExpresswayTokenizationBroker.pdf relnofollowhttpinfo.intel.comrsintelimagesIntelExpresswayTokenizationBroker.pdfa to avoid a PCI Audit for the application and server.p  pTherefore, the Adapter calls that have something to do with payment data would need to go through this hardware appliance before hitting the worklight server. All other adapter calls should go to the worklight server directly to not overload the appliance. The idea is to have two different URLs but the same worklight server in the background. It is assumed that the calls through the appliance will be transparent for the worklight server, so worklight functionality should not be impacted.p  pMy questions around this would bep  ul lipa Worklight bestpractice for having two different URLs for the same worklight server and alternating those URLs from the client for Adapter invocations only not direct update or anything else, since we assume this is executed nativepli lipis it possible to dynamically overwrite the worklight server URL that is used for an adapter invocation through JavaScript code in the client code e.g. overwrite a specific JS function that getsreturns the worklight URL from somewhere before the WL.Client AJAX adapter invocationpli ul  pWe are also looking into having a loadbalancer switch the route based on a regex of the AdapterName that is being invoked or so. But it is not sure right now if that is possible and what the performance impact is.p

Negative 9780 pI am working with a grouped codeUITableViewcode each containing a subclassed codeUITextFieldcode as its content view.  The subclassed codeUITextFieldcode only contains an additional property codeindexPathcode to store its position within the table.p  pThe issue I face is that I want to record which text field is the current responder so I added a codeUITextFieldcode property to my view controller. I implemented the codetextFieldDidBeginEditingcode delegate method and when the method is called the codetextFieldcode pointer argument is stored as the first responder property of my view controller.p  pWhen in use the field is initially focusable, however if I end editing by pushing codeReturncode on the keyboard, the keyboard disappears and I am no longer able to bring the focus back to the original text field or any of the other text fields in the table.p  pIf I remove the line codeself.firstResponder  LKCTableViewTextField textFieldcode from the codetextFieldDidBeginEditingcode delegate method all works as expected but I do not have the pointer to the text field set as first responder.p  pHas anyone had this issue or know of whats going onp  pThanks,p  pEricp

The codeproguardcode is setup according to emMopubem guidelines.p  pI have added the following to codeproguardcode for my projectp  precodekeep class com.google.ads. keep class com.millennialmedia.android. keep public class com.mopub.mobileads. keepclassmembers class com.millennialmedia.android.  public   codepre  pIn the release build, when I try to display an ad I get the following logs p  precodeIMoPub   29856 Fetching ad network type admobnative DMoPub   29856 Loading custom event interstitial adapter.

Negative 9780 pIm stuck with a little development annoyance. I have crated an application to extend Sitecore authoring interface.  The application queries some internal services and asks few additional questions from a content author before creating an new content item in Sitecore.  I have modeled the app on Sitecore.Shell.Applications.Templates.CreateTemplate.CreateTemplateForm. p  pThe problem Im having is, as soon as an item is created my WizardForm is reloaded to load newly created item.  What I want is for the wizard to go through to the Final page and reload the main UI once the modal dialog is closed.  Exactly how new OOTB template wizard works. I know that if I comment my item creation code out the UI behaves as expected.  Looks like a create of an item generates some events in the background that UI is responding to and reloads my modal dialog with the newly created item. I have tried the following solutions a hrefhttpsdn.sitecore.netForumShowPost.aspxpostid29092 relnofollowhttpsdn.sitecore.netForumShowPost.aspxpostid29092a, a hrefhttpsdn.sitecore.netForumShowPost.aspxpostid29968 relnofollowhttpsdn.sitecore.netForumShowPost.aspxpostid29968a, however this does not seem to solve it for me.p  pThe original code seems to disable events like sop  precode        this.CreateTemplatePicker.DisableEvents         TemplateItem templateItem  Client.ContentDatabase.Templates.CreateTemplatethis.TemplateName.Value, selectionItem         this.CreateTemplatePicker.EnableEvents codepre  pI have tried the followingp  precode        Client.Site.Notifications.Disabled  true         var item  container.AddItemUtil.ProposeValidItemNamethis.Title.Value, Settings.ProductImageTemplateID         Client.Site.Notifications.Disabled  false codepre  pAND OLSOp  precode        Item item         using new EventDisabler                      item  container.AddItemUtil.ProposeValidItemNamethis.Title.Value, Settings.ProductImageTemplateID          codepre  pAll with the same result. The wizard modal dialog is reloaded as soon as I get to the page where the item is created.  Using fiddler I can see the command to reload the windows is sent to the client. I just cant figure out how do I tell Sitecore UI to ignore the events or alternatively prevent events from being generated in the first place. The first command being sent to the UI below tells the page to load Content Editor, exactly the thing Im trying to prevent.p  precodecommands[     commandSetLocation,valuesitecoreshellsitecorecontentApplicationsContent20Editor.aspxfo7b186F686EA8FF4303B59F4D284A5A01967dampdbmasterampid7B186F686EA8FF4303B59F4D284A5A01967Damplaenampvs1,     commandSetDialogValue,value186F686EA8FF4303B59F4D284A5A0196,     commandSetStyle,valuenone,idConstraints,namedisplay,     commandSetStyle,value,idLastPage,namedisplay,     commandSetAttribute,valuetrue,idNextButton,namedisabled,     commandSetOuterHtml,valueltbutton idCancelButton classscButton TabIndex0 onclickjavascriptreturn scForm.postEventthis,event onkeydownjavascriptscForm.handleKeythis, event, null, amp3932amp39gtFinishltbuttongt,idCancelButton,     commandFocus,valueCancelButton,scrollintoview0,commandEval,valuescUpdateWizardControls,     commandSetAttribute,valuetrue,idBackButton,namedisabled,commandEval,valuescAlignWizardButtons     ] codepre  pJust a little info about my Sitecore environmentp  precodeSitecore started Sitecore.NET 7.0. rev. 130810  CInetpubwwwrootsc71WebsitebinSitecore.Client.dll Sitecore CMS, Sitecore Client Application, 7.0 rev. 130810 CInetpubwwwrootsc71WebsitebinSitecore.Kernel.dll Sitecore CMS, Sitecore CMS Kernel Library, 7.0 rev. 130810 CInetpubwwwrootsc71WebsitebinSitecore.Nexus.dll Sitecore.Nexus  Operating system Microsoft Windows NT 6.2.9200.0  Microsoft.NET version 4.0.30319.18051  Process id 8040 Windows identity used by the process NT AUTHORITYNETWORK SERVICE.

Negative 9780 pI am trying to perform a relatively simple calculation for groups of data within a csv. I have a feeling the function I need to be using is contained within the collections lib, but having been through the documentation for this library several times a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2librarycollections.html relnofollowhttpdocs.python.org2librarycollections.htmla. I cannot work out how to use this library in order to achieve my desired output. Perhaps there is another wayp  pWhat I need to do efficiently is for each codeUniqueclasselementcode group identify the largest number in column 4 zero based column reference. Then for each row within that group calculate the difference between this large number and the number for column 4 in this row. For the first three rows in codeUniqueclasselement1code it would be, code6code code15code amp code2code 111 minus 105,96 amp 109 respectively.

Negative 9780 pSay you have a list of gps coordinates for every restaurant on earth, and you have the coordinates for your current location. You want to find the closest n restaurants. Obviously it could take forever to search through an unsorted list, they need to be indexed somehow.p  pHow should they be storedindexed to be able to find the closest ones easily I was thinking some kind of a double dictionary by latitude and longtitude or a double hash of some kind, but Im sure this problem has been tackled before, and Im wondering if theres an optimal solution.p

Negative 9780 pI recently tried to implement a cascading dropdown into my application with this tutorial on petermac.com a hrefhttpwww.petermac.comrails3jqueryandmultiselectdependencies relnofollowhttpwww.petermac.comrails3jqueryandmultiselectdependenciesap  pThe tutorial basically talks about doing a cascading dropdown, where every dropdown box is an a separate partial and gets loaded with an jQuery onChange event when the parent select is changed.p  pNow I got this to work without a problem. But actually my select boxes have quite complicate relationships between them.p  pSo, the form I belongs to a Model called AuditFunction and as the name says is for auditing. Every audit has a source and a target, which can be compared via several commands. The source as well as the target are selected via 3 select boxes. The first box selects the type of database the field is in. The second box selects the table and then the third box selects the field. As the field box can contain thousands of options I tried to implement the cascading dropdown to make it easier for the user to select the field.p  pTo give you an overview, this is what my actions look likep  precode new.html.erb  lt simpleformfor auditfunction do f gt   lt f.input database1, as gt select, collection gt databases, includeblank gt true gt   lt render partial gt databases1  gt   lt render partial gt fields1  gt   lt f.input database2, as gt select, collection gt databases, includeblank gt true gt   lt render partial gt databases2  gt   lt render partial gt fields2  gt lt end gt codepre  pThe javascript for this looks like thisp  precode jQuery  ltscript typetextjavascript charsetutf8gt jQueryfunction     when the country field changes   auditfunctiondatabase1.changefunction      var database1  selectauditfunctiondatabase1 selected.val     ifdatabase1   database10     jQuery.getauditfunctionsupdatedatabase1idselect  database1, functiondata         database1id.htmldata          return false      ltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript charsetutf8gt jQueryfunction     when the country field changes   auditfunctiondatabase2.changefunction      var database2  selectauditfunctiondatabase2 selected.val     ifdatabase2   database20     jQuery.getauditfunctionsupdatedatabase2idselect  database2, functiondata         database2id.htmldata          return false      codepre  pp  pNow Im only going to show you the partials for database1id and field1id, but they look the same as database and field 2.p  precode databases1.html.erb  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt   jQueryfunction    auditfunctiondatabase1id.changefunction    var database1id  selectauditfunctiondatabase1id selected.val   ifdatabase1id   database1id0   jQuery.getauditfunctionsupdatefield1idselect  lt params[id] gt  database1id, functiondata     field1id.htmldata      return false       ltscriptgt  lt simpleformfor auditfunction do f gt   lt if params[id] gt lt if params[id]  imp gt   lt f.input database1id, collection AdOriTbl.all.orderorifilename asc.collect a [a.orifilename,a.id] gt   lt elsif params[id]  ori gt     lt f.input database1id, collection AdOriTbl.all.orderotbfilename asc.collect a [a.otbfilename,a.id] gt   lt elsif params[id]  mod gt     lt f.input database1id, collection AdQryMod.all.orderqrymodtext asc.collect a [a.qrymodtext,a.id] gt   lt end gt lt end gt   lt end gt codepre  pAnd now the file containing the target field.p  precode fields1.html.erb  lt simpleformfor auditfunction do f gt   lt if params[id] gt     lt if params[id].gsub1d1,z,    mod  gt       lt f.input field1id, collection AdQryFld.whereadqrymodid params[id].gsubAw1,1, .toi.orderorderid asc.collect f [f.qryfieldtext,f.id] gt     lt else gt       lt f.input field1id, collection AdOriFld.whereadoritblid params[id].gsubAw1,1, .toi.orderid asc.collect f [f.otbcolhdg,f.id] gt     lt end gt   lt end gt lt end gt codepre  pThe controller then contains all the actions triggered in the javascriptsp  precode auditfunctionconroller.rb  def new   authorize new, auditfunctions   auditfunction  AuditFunction.new    functions  [[I18n.ttext sum,sum],[I18n.ttext quantity,quantity],[I18n.ttext largestvalue,largestvalue],[I18n.ttext smallestvalue,smallestvalue]]   databases  [[I18n.ttext originaldatabase,imp],[I18n.ttext archivedatabase,ori],[I18n.ttext querydatabase,mod]] end  def updatedatabase1idselect   if params[id]  mod     type  mod   elsif params[id]  ori     type  ori   elsif params[id]  imp     type  imp   end   render partial databases1, id type end  def updatefield1idselect   type  params[id]   render partial fields1, id type end codepre  pNow, as messy as all of this looks, the good thing is that it gets the job done.

But when I try to edit an object only the field with the database type database1 and database2 are filled. The select boxes for the IDs of the databases are not rendered, while the boxes for the fields are. But all four ID fields are empty.p  pNow I already tried to fill the boxes by hand with a jQuery that basically looks similar to the ones I already have, but instead of getting triggered onChange, I trigger it when my auditfunction has a databaseid and render the select box and fill it with the value according value of databaseid. This works as well.p  pThe problem is that I cant do this with the fieldid, because in the partial of database1id where the jQuery for the fields get triggered, I dont have the auditfunction object at hand and also it seems to interfere with the other javascripts.p  pBesides that Id also like to think that there is a better way to do this, then my way. But I already tried other tutorials and ways and they either dont work when you dont have your straightforward CountryStateCity relationships or they dont work when editing.p  pSo, any help would be really appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 9780 pObviously Spotlight is a very useful resource in finding documents because it has the ability to search for text strongemwithinemstrong a document as well as text in the title. This process, however, must require a large amount of processing power and time. Furthermore, a certain document, lets say a pdf is generally encrypted, and if spotlight had to decrypt every .doc or .pdf in order to search through it, this would be incredibly slow. This implies that somewhere, macs store a cached version of files such as our pdf. Does anyone know where Or can anyone disprove this ideap  pThanksp

Negative 9780 pI met exactly the same issue as in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19504723androidbuildineclipsenotgeneratingtherightresourceidsinrjavaAndroid Build in Eclipse not generating the right resource ids in R.javaa, since that link doesnt have a renderscript tag, I reported it here again with some additional info.p  pIn sum, if I create a library project and added some custom renderscripts the following issue will occur. If I link the library project with another UI project by adding p  precodeandroid.library.reference.1..xxx codepre  pin the UI projects project.properties file, then calling findViewById in that UI project will always return null, no matter what I did. If I remove the custom renderscript in the library project, the UI project works fine.p  pI also tried to delete all the possible resources in the library project only the renderscript resource was kept, the same issue occurs. So this proves that the issue was caused by renderscript.p  pIm working with the latest SDK bundle adtbundlewindowsx8620131030 and Android SDK Tools version 22.3, Platform tools version 19, Build tools version 19.p  pThe same issue occurs in the earlier SDK versions as well.p  pIs this a bug with Eclipse ADT Is there any workaround solution before a fix. Thank youp  pstrongUpdatestrong Some updates. I found a solution to this issue. If I use the old adtbundlewindowsx8620130729 SDK bundle to compile and launch the application it will success and then switch back to the adtbundlewindowsx8620130917 or the adtbundlewindowsx8620131030 the new ones, this problem will disappear I tried this in two machines and it all behave like that. I dont know the reason why but hope this will help you if you meet the same problem.p

Negative 9780 pI have a client who wants to have an XRay effect that reveals clickable data points. A slider would be used to move a viewing window over an image, that would reveal an xray, or secondary image as the slider is moved. Ive adapted Eli Kirks XRay effect a hrefhttpelikirk.com20131202draggablexrayeffectusingcssjavascript relnofollowhttpelikirk.com20131202draggablexrayeffectusingcssjavascripta to get what I have so far a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netxfxLx3 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netxfxLx3a. The jQuery UI portion of it is easy enoughp  precodevar artWidth  300 document.readyfunction    .xraySlider.slider     slide functione, ui        var newLeft  ui.value  100  artWidth  100       .xrayWindow.cssbackgroundposition newLeft  1  px 0px, left newLeft  px         codepre  pThe problem Im having is making clickable data points that would be revealed by the window as it is slid across the main image.

Negative 9780 pIm attempting to access data from two different database tables and then join them together on two fields using LINQ in C.  I believe that I have a logically sound overall working approach.  Part of the problem Im running into is that Im filtering the data from both tables prior to joining them, because the tables have far too much data and it would cause a crash.p  pThe main problem is that for one of the tables I need to pull only data that has a timestamp column value of today.  The timestamp value is of type System.DateTime.p  pIve tried a few different waysp  precode        DateTime currentDate  System.DateTime.Now          var seconddata  from b in this.database.table             where EntityFunctions.DiffDaysb.timeStamp.Value, currentDate  0             select b codepre  pIm under the impression this doesnt work because theres no function in the database to handle it.  Inner Exception FUNCTION database.DiffDays does not existp  precode        var seconddata  from b in this.database.table             where b gt b.timeStamp.Value.Date  DateTime.Now.Date             select b codepre  pThis doesnt work because The specified type member Date is not supported in LINQ to Entities. Only initializers, entity members, and entity navigation properties are supported.p  precode        var seconddata              this.database.table.Wheresd gt sd.timeStamp.Value.Date  DateTime.Now.Date codepre  pBut this again fails because of the use of .Date.p  pUnfortunately, because I dont have the memory to hold all that data, the possibility of of pulling all the data first and then running date logic on it is out of the question.  If anyone could give any insight on how I might be able to solve this problem it would be greatly appreciated, thank you.p

Negative 9780 pIve been going crazy over this particular problem. What I am trying to do is make an HTTPS Call to the server after a user clicks the sign up button. The server must add the new user to the database and send me back a user key. Ive tested the httpClient class with a local LAMP server without HTTPS. Works fine. When I try to connect to the productions  server with SSL I GET A 404  NOT FOUND. I have double checked that the URL, CONTENT and Authorization is formatted well. As a matter of facted I codded it in a console application and it connects to the production server every time. It just does not work with the windows phone emulator or my windows phone. Been monitoring everything with fiddler. Ive also used the WebClient class to no avail.

Negative 9780 pI think Im having a similar issue to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19546035canvasdrawimagenotdrawingimagetocanvasthis questiona, but I would like a little help understanding how to use a callback function and how to implement it for my particular situation. Im trying to have an image get drawn to a canvas on demand, i.e. any time a certain function is called. The image is associated with an object I call a Block. A Block has dimensions, coordinates, and a url.p  precodevar canvas  document.getElementByIdmyCanvas var context  canvas.getContext2d  function Blockx, y, width, height, url          this.x  x         this.y  y         this.width  width         this.height  height         this.url  url         this.drawBlock  drawBlock         function drawBlock                var blockSprite  new Image               blockSprite.src  url               blockSprite.onload  context.drawImageblockSprite,x,y,width,height             codepre  pYou can see a demo a hrefhttpjsfiddle.neth7pbx1 relnofollowherea. Oddly enough, it works if I link to an image on the web, but fails if I link to an image on my disk. I believe that this is because the onload event occurs before drawBlock is called, and that I need to use callbacks or promises to fix this, but Im very new to Javascript so Id like a little guidance here. Any help or advice would be appreciated.p

Negative 9780 pa hrefhttpmayaposch.wordpress.com20111101howtoreallytrulyuseqthreadsthefullexplanation relnofollowThis articlea detailing the proper use of QThread saysp  blockquote   pBy the way, one extremely important thing to note here is that you should NEVER allocate heap objects using new in the constructor of the QObject class as this allocation is then performed on the main thread and not on the new QThread instance, meaning that the newly created object is then owned by the main thread and not the QThread instance. This will make your code fail to work. Instead, allocate such resources in the main function slot such as process in this case as when that is called the object will be on the new thread instance and thus it will own the resource.p blockquote  pI understand the first part that the allocation of heap objects and thus running a constructor happens in the thread that created the QObject. Only after that it is pushed to the QThread using QThreadmoveToThread.p  pHowever I dont quite understand the ownership issue mentioned, specificallyp  blockquote   pmeaning that the newly created object is then owned by the main threadp blockquote  pIt certainly is not referring standard ownership of resources because in Qt that can be easily controlled by parentchildren mechanism.p  pDoes it mean underlying memory management mechanisms of multithreading or QThread although that is just a wrapper of OS thread implementation as far as I know As in that there is a different memory segmentcache for each thread where its resources are storedp  pIf that is the case I could see the problem but I cannot find the full answer or explanation. Thanksp

Negative 9780 pI understand that Angular really naturally allows user interactions to update a model. In fact, there are lots of questions about it already on SO, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14409815modifyinganarraywithinanobjectthatsdisplayedinangrepeatheres one of those questionsa.p  pIn that scenario, the user must interact with the model through the view.p  pBut how can I modify a model in the collection as a result of something programmatic from the controller for instance... lets say Im building a loader of some kind with a unique progress number associated with each loader. When the user starts to load something, the load event is added to the collection of past load events. and now, I want to make some updates to the loader.progress via ajax.p  pSo the view would show something like thisp  precodeLoading Assets  Loader 1  53 Loader 2  91 Loader 3  9 Loader 4  43 codepre  pand the collection of models is something like thisp  precodescope.loaders  [      asset somePicture.jpg, progress 53 ,      asset movie.mov, progress 91 ,      asset someProgram.torrent, progress 9 ,      asset etc.txt, progress 43  ] codepre  pand when I first initiate a new loader, i would add it to the collection this wayp  precodescope.loaders.push asset reallyCoolSong.mp3, progress 0  codepre  pAnd naturally, the next step would be to update codereallyCoolSong.mp3codes progress after ajax functions complete.p  pHow do I do thatp

Basically all I want is that whenever I commit a transaction, there is a mechanism that doesnt allow transaction to get committed if it would break the constraint that i wrote about.

Negative 9780 pIm using PHP to write an application where the user can encrypt his text several times with several possible algorithms to use. At first i thought this was really simple, but then i thought of the problem that occurs, when data is padded to blocksize, encrypted and then decrypted.p  pAt first i thought i could just remove the nullbytes after every decryption process to get the original data before padding. Now if the data has several nullbytes at the end itself, then removing the nullbytes after the decryption process will just remove parts of the original data and end in losing data and maybe wrong decryption too the last point depends on the blocksize of the following decryption algorithms. Although the possibility that the data or data after several encryption processes contains several nullbytes is nearly zero, I am looking for a solution to solve the problem described above.p  pIf I dont want to strip nullbytes from the data, I will also get some annoying results depending on the blocksizes of used algorithms. To show that i wrote a python programm, which has three cryptographic algorithms, one operates with a blocksize of 2 bytes, another operates on a blocksize of 3 and the last one has a blocksize of 4, so you can compare them to 128, 192 and 256bit algorithms. I started with some random bytes and encrypted them several times, then decrypted them without removing nullbytes after every decryptionprocess. The programm printed the bytes after every decryptionencryptionprocess in hexadecimal format, here is the output with some comments from mep  precode48 61 6c 6c 6f                      thats our data at the start da b4 28 fe 9e 4a                   now the 3byte algorithm was run gt padded to 6 bytes 5e 62 04 72 1a d8 d2 a4             used the 4byte algorithm gt padded to 8 bytes cc a1 43 e0 f5 e7 40 eb 81          3byte algorithm used again gt padded to 9 bytes 48 61 7a 07 71 1e 3f 0f 05 8d 98 a4 at last used the 4byte algorithm gt padded to 12 bytes cc a1 43 e0 f5 e7 40 eb 81 00 00 00 first encryption done, notice the three nullbytes and the similarity to line 4 5e 62 04 72 1a d8 d2 a4 00 92 0f 2a secound encryption done, not removed nullbytes decrypted, but the rest goes well, as seen in line 3 da b4 28 fe 9e 4a 00 00 84 1a 8d 03 third encryption done, same as above, decryption of nullbytes results in chaos, but original data still the same 48 61 6c 6c 6f 00 92 0f ae 88 98 be last encryption, we got original data with some near random bytes codepre  pYou can see that the first decryptionprocess goes well, the secound one too, except for the 3 paddingbytes that get decrypted. So, after each encryption process, we come closer to our original data, but we keep decryption these padding bytes. Note If someone doubts my encryptiondecryptionfunctions, I tested them several 100 times and they worked every time, I can also post the source code if required or doubtedp  pTo put all this to a simple question,  when I decrypt data, how can I know, which nullbytes are part of the original data and which are added by the encryption algorithm Do you have any ideas how I can do thatp

Negative 9780 pI am trying to understand how clientside emulation prepared statement in MySQL JDBC driver works.p  pstrongPart 1strong I read online that for prepared statements, there are four steps involved when a relational database handles a JDBCSQL query and they are as followsp  ol liParse the incoming SQL queryli liCompile the SQL queryli liPlanoptimize the data acquisition pathli liExecute the optimized query  acquire and return datali ol  pThe preexecution of steps compiles the SQL statement and hence provides preoptimization.

Finally class Salary is supposed to do the balancing part and class payment will handle payment part banking.

And scroll indicators never appear. p  pWhat am I doing wrong. Which attributes do I have to set in the UIScrollView, so that scrolling is enabled. It seems that the interface editor of XCode sets some attributes, which prohibit scrolling.p

This worked Great.pli lipOn each fieldset i introduced a range input. I am going to perform a calculation and it forces the user to enter a numeric value.pli lipI then followed another tutorial in order to introduce a bubble displaying the selected value of the range control.pli lipWhen the page loads it draws the bubble at the side of each range control. However when i navigate to the second frameset the bubble for all the items is drawn in the middle of the page not in the correct position and all on top of each other.pli lipwhen the user selects a vale from the range control the bubble is then redrawn in the correct position.pli ol  pI would like to automatically redraw all of the bubbles on the second stage of the quote when the user navigates away from the first stage.p  pI would assume that this is failing because I reset the value of the range input on the change event which is only triggered when the user changes the valuep  pCould

Negative 9780 pIm trying to have a horizontally scrolling UIScrollView with horizontal paging kinda like a UIPageController but managed by a single UIViewControllerp  pBecause Im using Auto Layout I have set up everything by using constraints for the views inside, and the scrollview works just fine. However what is odd is that the paging works in a weird way.p  pSpecifically the scrolling becomes really slow and it takes over 5 seconds for the scroll view to snap in place. I am absolutely puzzled by this because I have done this before with a smaller view about three pages as opposed to 6 and it worked flawlessly.p  pI have created a sample project to illustrate this just build it and try scrolling left and right  it works best if you just flick once.br  a hrefhttpmbx.cmtMmLIi relnofollowhttpmbx.cmtMmLIiap  pThe only thing that seems to prevent this is having the viewcontroller manage the scrollview directly as opposed to have it inside a UIView, but Im sure the problem lies elsewhere so I figured Id try my luck to see if any Auto Layout gurus can help me out on this one.p

Negative 9780 pI am still trying to wrap my head around exactly how views work and when it is best to use a view vs querying a table directly.  Here is my scenariop  ol liAll of the underlying data resides in a single table that stores three months worth of datali liThe table includes four columns  TagName, Alarm, Timestamp, and Value  TagName and Timestamp are indexedli liThere is a view of this table no other tables involved that shows one weeks worth of data and combines Alarm and Value into a single column.li liThe database used in this scenario is SQL Server.li ol  pI only need to retrieve 5  30 minutes worth of data.  Is more efficient to write a query against the underlying table that combines Alarm and Value into a single column like the view and sets the time range dynamically, or query the existing view by passing in a time range  To me, the former seems like the way to go since the latter essentially requires two queries.  Furthermore, in the second scenario, the first query i.e. the view would load an unnecessary number of values into memory.  p

Negative 9780 pI have an interface between a client and a server where a client sends 1 an unsigned value, and 2 a flag which indicates if value is signedunsigned. Server would then static cast unsigned value to appropriate type. p  pI later found out that this is implementation defined behavior and Ive been reading about it but I couldnt seem to find an appropriate solution thats completely safe Ive read about type punning, pointer conversions, and memcpy. p  pWould simply using a union type work A UnionType containing signed and unsigned int, along with the signedunsigned flag. For signed values, client sets the signed part of the union, and server reads the signed part. Same for the unsigned part. Or am I completely misunderstanding somethingp  pSide question how do I know the specific behavior in this case for a specific scenario, e.g. windriver diab on PPC Im a bit lost on how to find such documentation.p

Negative 9780 pI know that this topic has been discussed a lot, but I believe that Ive found a new variation of it I have a Rails 4 application, which was upgraded from Rails 3, and which has the coderailsujscode and codecsrfmetatagscode setup correctly.p  pOnce the coderooturlcode is loaded in the browser, there is a javascript that fires a GET and a PUT, each one to its respective controller API in the application. By the moment those 2 API calls are fired, the session SHOULD have the codecsrftokencode there. And this is true, most of the times. Keep reading.p  pThe problem is that, SOMETIMES, not always, we see some InvalidAuthenticityToken exceptions happening for the PUT request. yes, Im using codeprotectfromforgery with gt exceptioncode on our API base controllers.p  pAnalyzing the dump from codeexceptionnotificationcode, I can see that the codeCSRFTOKENcode is setup correctly in the request header, but the most intriguing thing is that the session has only the codesessionidcode on it. Everything else is gone, including the codecsrftokencode.p  pRemember this is happening intermittently So I believe that it must be some kind of race condition.p  pThis app is hosted on Heroku and running on Unicorn. Im unable to reproduce the problem in my local environment. Ive also read a lot of Rails code on github trying to understand the flows in which it resets the session, but I could not find the answer, since all CSRF protection is setup correctly and the problem happens intermittently.p  pIts also worth mentioning that we did not setup codeconfig.secretkeybasecode yet. But as this problem is happening intermittently, I dont think that this may be the root cause of it.p  pAlso, I believe its worth mentioning that we have two controller hierarchiesp  p1 all normal application requests go through controllers which inherits from codeApplicationControllercodep  p2 all API requests go through controllers which inherits from ApiBaseController, which inherits from codeActionControllerBasecode directlyp  pI believe this controllers scheme is the most common for everybody...p  pThe API endpoint for the GET request is rendering a json response. The API endpoint for the PUT request is returning codehead okcode.p  pWell, I would love if some Ruby on Rails expert could help on this.p

Negative 9780 pThere are several similar questions but none of the answers seem to work. I have 3 different web sites one page each built using Visual Studio Express 2013 Web. They all use signalR. In fact one is the example SignalR.Sample that can be downloaded from Nuget. They all work on IIS Express. They all USED to work on IIS. They all give the above error on IIS  using Internet Explorer set to debug. FireFox and Chrome just give the webpage without starting signalR. The exact same 3 sites work on IIS on a separate computer.p  pSo I think it is my setup of IIS that has changed and is wrong.p  pPrevious to the problem I had loaded Abyss Web Server to try to get the site running on that I failed and I had deselected IIS so that it could not possibly be interfering.p  pI have now removed Abyss and reinstated IIS making sure that ASP.Net and  .Net 4 is being used.p  pCan anybody direct me where to look for the problemp  pJust for the record I show below the jQuery files being loadedp  precode ltScript references. gt ltReference the jQuery library. gt ltscript srcScriptsjquery2.1.1.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltReference the jQuery.color library. gt ltscript srcScriptsjquery.color2.1.2.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltReference the SignalR library. gt ltscript srcScriptsjquery.signalR2.1.1.jsgtltscriptgt ltReference jonson2 for old Browsers script. gt ltscript srcScriptsjson2.jsgtltscriptgt ltReference the autogenerated SignalR hub script. gt ltscript srcsignalrhubsgtltscriptgt ltReference the StockTicker script. gt ltscript srcAPRS.jsgtltscriptgt ltReference the sorting jquery script. gt ltscript srcsorttable.jsgtltscriptgt codepre
Negative 9780 pThe question might sound a little bit odd. The background is Im working on some performance tuning tasks of our iOS Mobile App, and I noticed that some of the concurrent requests are blocked until the prior ones are finished. and the number of allowed concurrent live connections seem to vary from different network conditions, e.g. 3G4G network, Edge, home broadband cable and etc. p  pI know from NSURLConnection, there is a limitation from the iOS SDK, no more than 5 live connections to one same host. But Im wondering if there is additionaldifferent restrictions from network carrier.p  pDoes any one know how to check the number outp
Negative 9780 pIn my app, there is currently a section that holds a fragment that queries the database for a list of objects and then displays them using a codeListViewcode.br When a user clicks one of the objects in the list, the section grows bigger in height to incorporate a different fragment that code.replacecodes the codeListViewcode fragment and moves up.  p  pThis new fragment displays information related to the object the user clicked.br One of the views in this fragment is a codeViewPagercode that contains only 2 fragments at most  p  ol liA timer fragment.li liA calendar fragment.li ol  pThe timer fragment is a fragment that simply uses a codeCountDownTimercode and changes a codeTextViewcodes text codeonTickcode. This fragment may or may not be shown, depending on the object.p  pThe calendar fragment however, contains an heavier view  a custom calendar view.br The calendar is supposed to show the days a year before and after the current date now.p  pThe calendar fragment or view, actually, since there is no logic strongat allstrong in the fragment causes the animation that fires when a user clicks on an object to stutter and it looks bad.   This only happens in the first time an object is clicked. In the second time its smoother I guess its thanks to the codeViewPagercode saving the fragments state, but Im not sure....p  pI was wondering whether there is any specific bottleneckproblem in the code that would cause it to behave like that. My best guess is that there are just too many views being loaded together.p  pThe first solution I thought of, is to basically move the animation inside the fragment and fire it only after the fragment is fully loaded and ready to be displayed. That, however, would mean that I will be controlling the parent the container of the fragment from within the fragment itself... not sure whether this is a good design or not. I could create a listener for that, and place its call in the end of codeonCreateViewcode, though.p  pAnother possible solution, and this is just a theory of mine, but creating all of the views on a separate thread, and only then adding them to the UI in the main thread could maybe slightly speed up the process. Although, Im not really sure how better that would be in terms of performance, if at all, and how much of a good practice this is.p  pHow can I optimize my codeCalendarViewcode or maybe my whole Object View Fragment in order to allow the animation to work properlyp  h1CalendarView consists ofh1  ul liA vertical codeLinearLayoutcode that contains 2 subviews ol liA topbar which is a

Negative 9780 pI have been trying to make images resize proportionally, leaving whitespace, so they are always fully seen in the browser window without having to scroll.  All of the solutions I have found so far can resize the image based on the browser window width, but if the proportions of the browser window dont match the image, then it will cut off the image and the user will have to scroll down to see the rest.  I know that there is also backgroundsize cover but I dont want the image to be clipped.  Any ideasp

I have to make the object become a string to send it, and for that purpose I use codeJSON.stringifycode. It decodes the encoded string. So code2Bcode becomes codecode again and It is not sent to the server via POST. p  pon the other hand If I use codestringifycode first and the codeencodeURIComponentcode it generates signs like  and   that shouldnt be encoded and the string is not a well written JSON p  pHow do you that Is that a way without using jQuery Do I have to build my own stringify functionp

Negative 9780 pI am managing a server providing web administration pages and communicating with client apps. I designed the web part which allows the public access through the 80 port. However, I was told from my client that they want the server to allow only the access from their intranet other than outside the company. I thought it can be done if Tomcat has an ability to filter the access to web pages based on IP address. However, I ended up in failing to find out a proper solution for that. I know Tomcat has already provided the filtering function according to a web project. I came up with a way of getting around this problem and used it as follows I make two service tags in server.xml likep  precodeltService nameCatalinagt  ltConnector port80 ...gt  ltService nameCatalina2gt  ltConnector port8080 ...gt  codepre  pAnd make another clone for the additional service. Then, I block all the external accesses through 8080 port by the firewall setup. This lives up to my clients needs. However, this is not a common way, I guess. Even, sometimes, the setting allows the external accesses which shouldnt happen. On top of this, its not an efficient way from the maintaining point of view.p  pAnyhow, I dont like it. It would be appreciated if someone told me the way. Thanks for reading the question.p

Negative 9780 pSay we have this for instancep  precodestring p p  new string[2] p[0]  Aa p[1]  Bb codepre  pWhat I understand I need to create a temp dynamic array to store what p has, delete p, and then create a new p with a row 1 size bigger than temp, and then copy temp into p.p  pWhat I do not understand How would I increase the size of p WITHOUT knowing the original rowsize in this case 2 and still keep the original data. Ive read about doing tricks such as sizeofarraysizeofdataType, but since I have a dynamic array, I have no idea how to find its size. realloc would format my original data, plus it acts funny with strings.p  pJust a heads up I do not want to use any form of linked lists, vectors, or things of that nature.p

Negative 9780 pWe have an existing web application thats been built on MVC amp SQL Membership provider for user authentication. The application also includes admin management screens for creatingediting users, resetting passwords, activating accounts etc... Its quite a mature system and has been in production for 2.5 years.p  pWe now have a new requirement to expose some data from the system via API, and were looking at WebApi as a candidate technology.p  pOne of the issues Im running into is around the authentication. Id like to leverage the existing userrole management functionality in our application, to create and manage the API accounts. However since the preferred option for WebAPI is to use ASP.NET Identity claimsbearer tokens etc... Im a bit confused about what the best options would be.p  pWould it be possible or a bad idea to somehow shoehorn in the existing membership provider userpassword authentication into the web api auth mechs. Theres a method in the codeApplicationOAuthProvidercode, that looks like I could manipulate by replacing the line codeIdentityUser user  await userManager.FindAsynccontext.UserName, context.Passwordcode with a call to the MembershipProvider. This seems very emcludgyem though.p  pThought amp options would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 9780 pIm developing a messaging system in delphi using TidTCPServer and TidTCPClient.p  pFirst all clients log in with a username and a password. The server searches for the user data in SQL server using ADO components.

I think that the TCP server is working asynchronously and multiple access to ADODataset at the same time is the problem. What should I do Should I put the incoming requests into a list and process them one by one until the list is clearp

At this point Ive created an entity successfully called Employees with all the supporting files that JHipster provides. Ive also managed to add the fields that I wanted to that entity which proved to be more difficult than I originally anticipated, but wasnt able to eliminate the sample fields without creating an error, so Ive left them there. p  pNow, maybe Im missing something here, but when I go and save a group of values in my entity, as soon as I terminate my application, those values evaporate.

Negative 9780 pIm having some difficulties about how to emcorrectlyem design and implement two methods.p  pI have 2 methods, A and B. Method A does 2 things and method B does only 1 thing. One of the things that method A does is the same as what method B does, so it is very reasonable to call method B from within a method A.p  pNow the problem is that both methods need to send exactly one email to a user. When I invoke A, I want to receive 1 email and when I invoke B, I also want to get 1 email. This means that if I call method B inside A, I will now get 2 mails while doing 1 action  invoking A. To make it even more tempting to simply include B in A, the set up procedure is truly the same for both methods and so instead of redoing the set up in the B, I could simply call method B with these set up data from A. But I have no setup data to provide when calling the B directly and so in this case Id need to do the setup anyway.p  pWhat is the best approach to solve such a problem Should Ip  ol liAdd a parameter to method B in which I will say whether it should send the email or not and another parameters for the setup datali liKeep the two methods separated, because method B is not doing emexactlyem the same thing in the two contextsli li... other suggestionsli ol  pPS. Im not sure if stackoverflow is actually suitable for such a question, let me know if theres a better stackexchange platform for this.p  pThanks for any ideasp

Negative 9780 pWe are using the petapoco repository pattern similar to this a hrefhttpprogrammerdave.commvc3petapocorepository relnofollowblog posta.  As the page loads we open up the repository, run the query, dispose and then carry on processing.  This is fine on light pages, but when this happens a few times in the page we get quite significant performance degradation.p  pI had, perhaps wrongly, assumed that connection pooling would cope with this, which is enabled.p  pI ran a couple of tests.p  pThe page its on its an aspx page takes around 1.2 seconds to load as it is at the moment. The page is running around 30 database queries...and, looking at the profiler, is doing a login and logout per query even with connection pooling. p  pIf I persist the connection and dont close until the page ends, this drops to around 70ms, which is quite a significant saving.p  pPerhaps we need to keep the Database object hanging around for the request, but I didnt think PetaPoco had this much of an overhead...particularly with the connection pooling.p  pI have created a a hrefhttpsgithub.compaulallingtonPetaPocoPerformance relnofollowtest appa to demonstrate it.p  pThis demonstrates that loading a user 1000 times takes 230ms if the repository is reused, but takes 3.5seconds if the repository is recreated every time.p

Negative 9780 pIve viewed a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma212007663130747This posta but I dont really understand the terms used nontrivial function dependency, superkeyp  pFrom what Ive read 2nd normal form seems to relate to composite keys whereas 3rd normal form relates to primary keys. p  pIm not sure if this is correct though. p  pSo 2nd normal form  theres a composite key and all fields in the table must relate to both of the composite key fields. If something doesnt relate then it should be refactored into another table. p  p3rd normal form  everything has to be dependent on the primary key  so Im guessing that in 3rd normal form theres only 1 key rather than in 2nd normal form where there can be composite keys p  pAny advice appreciated. p

We put this into a special  section so we can force the header to be in the start of the final program.  You dont need to understand all these details as it is just magic values that  is documented in the multiboot standard. The bootloader will search for this  magic sequence and recognize us as a multiboot kernel. section .multiboot align 4     dd MAGIC     dd FLAGS     dd CHECKSUM   Currently the stack pointer register esp points at anything and using it may  cause massive harm. Instead, well provide our own stack.

It  doesnt make sense to return from this function as the bootloader is gone. section .text global start start      Welcome to kernel mode We now have sufficient code for the bootloader to      load and run our operating system. It doesnt do anything interesting yet.      Perhaps we would like to call printfHello, Worldn. You should now      realize one of the profound truths about kernel mode There is nothing      there unless you provide it yourself. There is no printf function. There      is no ltstdio.hgt header. If you want a function, you will have to code it      yourself. And that is one of the best things about kernel development      you get to make the entire system yourself. You have absolute and complete      power over the machine, there are no security restrictions, no safe      guards, no debugging mechanisms, there is nothing but what you build.       By now, you are perhaps tired of assembly language. You realize some      things simply cannot be done in C, such as making the multiboot header in      the right section and setting up the stack. However, you would like to      write the operating system in a higher level language, such as C or C.      To that end, the next task is preparing the processor for execution of      such code. C doesnt expect much at this point and we only need to set up      a stack. Note that the processor is not fully initialized yet and stuff      such as floating point instructions are not available yet.       To set up a stack, we simply set the esp register to point to the top of      our stack as it grows downwards.     mov esp, stacktop       We are now ready to actually execute C code. We cannot embed that in an      assembly file, so well create a kernel.c file in a moment. In that file,      well create a C entry point called kernelmain and call it here.     extern kernelmain     call kernelmain       In case the function returns, well want to put the computer into an      infinite loop. To do that, we use the clear interrupt cli instruction      to disable interrupts, the halt instruction hlt to stop the CPU until      the next interrupt arrives, and jumping to the halt instruction if it ever      continues execution, just to be safe.     cli .hang     hlt     jmp .hang codepre  h2kernel.ch2  precodeif definedcplusplus include ltstdbool.hgt  C doesnt have booleans by default.  endif include ltstddef.hgt include ltstdint.hgt   Check if the compiler thinks if we are targeting the wrong operating system.  if definedlinux error You are not using a crosscompiler, you will most certainly run into trouble endif   This tutorial will only work for the 32bit ix86 targets.  if definedi386 error This tutorial needs to be compiled with a ix86elf compiler endif   Hardware text mode color constants.  enum vgacolor      COLORBLACK  0,     COLORBLUE  1,     COLORGREEN  2,     COLORCYAN  3,     COLORRED  4,     COLORMAGENTA  5,     COLORBROWN  6,     COLORLIGHTGREY  7,     COLORDARKGREY  8,     COLORLIGHTBLUE  9,     COLORLIGHTGREEN  10,     COLORLIGHTCYAN  11,     COLORLIGHTRED  12,     COLORLIGHTMAGENTA  13,     COLORLIGHTBROWN  14,     COLORWHITE  15,   uint8t makecolorenum vgacolor fg, enum vgacolor bg      return fg  bg ltlt 4   uint16t makevgaentrychar c, uint8t color      uint16t c16  c     uint16t color16  color     return c16  color16 ltlt 8   sizet strlenconst char str      sizet ret  0     while  str[ret]  0          ret     return ret   static const sizet VGAWIDTH  80 static const sizet VGAHEIGHT  25  sizet terminalrow sizet terminalcolumn uint8t terminalcolor uint16t terminalbuffer  void terminalinitialize      terminalrow  0     terminalcolumn  0     terminalcolor  makecolorCOLORLIGHTGREY, COLORBLACK     terminalbuffer  uint16t 0xB8000     for  sizet y  0 y lt VGAHEIGHT y               for  sizet x  0 x lt VGAWIDTH x                       const sizet index  y  VGAWIDTH  x             terminalbuffer[index]  makevgaentry , terminalcolor                 void terminalsetcoloruint8t color      terminalcolor  color   void terminalputentryatchar c, uint8t color, sizet x, sizet y      const sizet index  y  VGAWIDTH  x     terminalbuffer[index]  makevgaentryc, color   void terminalputcharchar c      terminalputentryatc, terminalcolor, terminalcolumn, terminalrow     if  terminalcolumn  VGAWIDTH               terminalcolumn  0         if  terminalrow  VGAHEIGHT                       terminalrow  0                 void terminalwritestringconst char data      sizet datalen  strlendata     for  sizet i  0 i lt datalen i          terminalputchardata[i]  void kernelmain      terminalinitialize      Since there is no support for newlines in terminalputchar yet, n will        produce some VGA specific character instead.

Negative 9780 pSince I havent found anything related to that which would have lead me to inspiration, I thought Id come up with this here.p  pI recently worked a lot with the a hrefhttpquartzscheduler.org relnofollowstrongQuartz Job Schedulerstronga which Ive already implemented within a RESTful Java Servlet that is supposed to offer a Sencha ExtJSbased UI for job creation. We use an Authenticator class in combination with a DatabaseManager that take care of authenticating users and all other databasespecific stuff using Hibernate.p  pSince we want to use it within the Java enterprise applications we develop, we need to run this thing for every customer. We also require the use of JobStoreTX for persistent data on MySQL databases obviously for clustering, so volatile RAMJobStore implementation is a taboo. I am aware of the official documentation and that Quartz itself doesnt seem to support multitenant implementation see a hrefhttpwww.quartzscheduler.orgdocumentationquartz2.xconfigurationConfigJDBCJobStoreClustering relnofollowstrongQuartz Clusteringstronga.p  pOur setup looks kinda like this simplfied br  1 production Tomcat serving application logic br  1 production Apache serving ExtJS frontend and static content br  n databases one for each customer brp  pTo add something even more tricky br we have legacy modules that are customerspecific each customer gets his own application hosting, while more uptodate modules are hosted centralized with customerrelated access. p  pIn my opinion, it wouldnt be sufficient to created the Quartzrelated tables on every customer database, since we want to stick with an easy, straight forward setup which means e.g. same table prefix for each customer etc just to not complicate the deployment of Quartz throughout the farm. p  pI already thought about combining it with strongMariaDB MaxScalestrong and using strongfiltersstrong to route Quartz to each customer database based on RegEx or something similar, with Quartz only talking to the MaxScale proxy, but this seemed a little bit too much overhead for what I try to achieve and I am not even sure if this would work at all.p  pIs there something that would give me strongmultitenancy with Quartzstrong Could you suggest an approach that would make Quartz being able to handle this, since we need to run jobs for each customer, but on one Tomcat which is actually clustered and loadbalanced Or is there another productframeworklibrary that supports multitenancy out of the boxp  pAny lead, idea or help is very much appreciatedp

Then when you click it again to open it, it is appearing from the bottom again.

Negative 9780 pI am writing a small Spring 4 MVC app.  Im new to it and thought I might try and get some advice about a point apologies Ive been looking at javespring for a couple of months now and I have a mixed level of unconsolidated knowledge which leaves me wildly fluctuating between jargon and lack of understanding.  p  pI am adding a header jsp or jspf to all the pages jsps.  At this early stage I am adding them with a  tag as the includeprelude stopped working at some point although I may go back and sort this out if I get time.  I dont think that is relevant though...p  pIn the header.jsp I just want to include a logo, title, link to a help pdf and the date the underlying data was last updated ideally updated once a day.  This last has got me thinking...p  pFirstly is it reasonable to include data in a header  And if it is presumably it makes more sense to call the date once and store it somewhere in the application It is not mission critical that it refreshes if it changes but Im sure there are reasonable ways to do this which ever way it goes.p  pSecondly, if it is reasonable, what would be the best way of doing this   Would I create a bean with one property and fill the date on application load I could call it appConfig and add more properties if they are needed I guess.  p  pThirdly, If this is reasonable then, and I have a horrible feeling this is a complete numpty question..., how would I access this objectdata from the header. Or should I give up and just add it as a dependency injected field into the home page and give up putting it in the header.p  pThanks if anyone does have time to help...p

Negative 9780 pId like use Canvas2D to make a glyph texture for WebGL. A glyph texture is a texture full of letters that you use to render text.p  pThe problem Im running into is I cant see, given the Canvas API, how to do this in a cross platform good way. What do I mean Well for example if I was using some old 8bit font where I knew each character was 8x8 pixels exactly, then Id know if I wanted say 32 glyphs Id need a texture some multiple of 32 8x8 cells. Like say 256x8 or 128x16 or 64x32 etc.. Id put the character for each glyph in each cell and be done.p  pUnfortunately I cant see any good way to figure out the size of letter using the canvas2D api without a ton of work.p  pFor example Lets say I want 8x16 EGA like glyphs. Well lets check. I tell the browser I want an 8px monospace font.p  precodevar ctx  document.createElementcanvas.getContext2d ctx.font  8px monospace var dim     minWidth 100,   maxWidth 0,  for var ii  33 ii lt 128 ii    var letter  String.fromCharCodeii   var t  ctx.measureTextletter   dim.minWidth  Math.mint.width, dim.minWidth   dim.maxWidth  Math.maxt.width, dim.maxWidth  console.logdim codepre  pIt printsp  precode Object minWidth 0, maxWidth 4.80078125 codepre  pThats clearly not what I want. On top of that AFAICT the size of the font is browser and platform dependent. Im not even sure if I use my own font if that guarantees what size the glyphs will be rendered for a given font size specification.p  pOne way is to try different sizes, measure their characters, then pick the closest match. That sounds very inefficient. p  pAnother would maybe to just pick a size and render all of the character and just use them the size they are scaling when used in WebGL. In this case though picking 8px monospace would make a pretty ugly font, at least in Chrome. I can iterate until I find something that looks good but then I have no idea if it will look good in another browser or on another platform.p  pIs there some official way to know the size a font will render so if you want to make glyphs you can Or is there some other reference for how to do this in general Like how a nonbrowser native app would deal with this.p  pI suppose for most native apps youd just let the user pick a font size and then clip or wrap when you run out of space. But for a game you often need your text to fit in some specifically sized space and so you need to pick a font that will fit that space well and there in seems to be the issue.p  pBTW this question came up making a hrefhttpwebglfundamentals.orgwebgllessonswebgltextglyphs.html relnofollowthis article about text in WebGLa.p

Negative 9780 pSo I launched a 3 node Cassandra Cluster via the community version of the DataStax AMI.  I am running m3.2XL boxes for all the nodes.  I have enabled batch loading in the configure file.  I installed the latest version of TitanHadoop2 as well and pointed it to the the local Cassandra instance.  I am running OpCenter as well and monitoring the cluster, etc...p  pMy issue is that I have a graph saved in MySQL that I dumped and pushed to s3 as flat files.  A set of files under a specific namespace on s3 for verts and another for edges.  I wrote a gremlin script to ingest verts and edges and it works fine.  The issue comes in that one 256mb file takes roughly 1015 minutes a piece and I have thousands of them... edges and verts combined.  The s3 connector, via s3fs was too slow so i pulled the files locally mounted drive thinking that that would speed things up but it hasnt. p  pAm I missing something  I have an EMR cluster that I could theoretically pull the data into and push it over to the Cassandra cluster but Im not sure how that would work.  p  pOne thing that also confuses me is that is Titan already using hadoop as its engine OR do I have to turn it on somehow  I get some warning messages via hadoop when i test and run jobs through gremlin such as WARN  org.apache.hadoop.util.NativeCodeLoader   Unable to load nativehadoop library for your platform... using builtinjava classes where applicablep  pThanks for the helpp
Negative 9780 pI have a real life situation which seems like a variant of TSP In a graph which is symmetric, and fully connected, all n vertices have to be covered only once. There is a start point and end point given to us. And the most important condition given is that of all possible arcs that can be covered, few arcs have to be necessarily covered as a given condition, i.e. the requirement is that few pairs of vertices are such where vertices in each pair have to be necessarily travelled through in successive order. I am looking forward to existing work in literature, or if someone can suggest some algorithm to solve this. Thank youp

Negative 9780 pIm trying to add a scrollview to my ViewController so that I can zoom and then scroll, but the SV wont size correctly inside the view. First, I have a xib with a standard view for my VC. Then I add a scrollView and pin it to that view. I pin a new view to that SV its content view, and then pin all my subviews inside that content view. However, despite the fact that everything is pinned to the first view, the scrollview expands beyond these pins. You can see the orange dotted line in this image that shows how the scrollView will expand. How can I get this scrollView to stay inside the phones screenp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwddM9.jpg altenter image description herep
Negative 9780 pI run a set of automated tests every night via TestExecute TestCompletes headless test runner.  The tests are ran via command line .bat file  Windows task scheduler on an RDP VM.  TestExecute then uses TCs Automatice RDP Session login functions to log on to a slave VM and run tests that way.  p  pThe problem is that over the weekend the screen resolution of the slave computer is being set to something really low the resolution of my laptop when its not docked, actually and, since the Application Im testing is an internal app that has to be set to 1920x1080, all of the tests are failing.  I have NO idea why this is happening, nor do I have any idea how to fix it.  My best guess is to somehow force the slave VM to always use a set resolution no matter what, but I have no idea if that is even possible.  p  pThanks very much for your help.  p

Negative 9780 pI have a codeUIViewcode that should be contained many different circular elements as subview or sublayer. Circular elements are just small shapes that are just filled circle with capability of taping on them and doing some actions. I can add them to the view as codeCAShapeLayercode or codeUIViewcode, but I have no idea which approach is better in terms of performance.p  pThe elements should be animated when they are going to appear at the first time afterwards they should recognize the tap gesture on them. Both codeUIViewcode and codeCAShapeLayercode or codeCALayercode objects are capable of animation, but considering the count of these elements which could be up to 30 items and concurrence of animations, which approach do you suggest considering performance and reliability issuep  pIve searched around a lot but the information was not enough to be able to make a certain decision.p  pThanks in advancep

SmsManager smsMng  SmsManager.getDefault     smsMng.sendTextMessagecfg.phoneNumberFormsg.level, null, msg.content, pi, null  codepre  pIt gets to the SmsManager.sendTextMessage method fine but strongnothingstrong happens, even if I hardcode the phone number and dont pass any PendingIntent the SMS strongstill doesnt gets sentstrong. It emmightem be because the IntentService ceases to exist after the method callp  pThe receivers both just grab the broadcasted Intent, fetch the data inside, and start appropiate actions in the IntentService to delete the SMSs if they have been sent, and to broadcast the applications PendingIntent so the UI can give some feedback to the user SMS sent, Error, etc.p  pMy TCP implementation of the same thing pretty much just has a Socket write instead of that sendTextMessage, it blocks the IntentService until its done and works fine.p  pAny ideas on why the SMS isnt being sent or how to better implement thisp

Negative 9780 pSo I was just playing with the idea of user plugins. I wrote a simple class that prints out a String. Then I wrote an interface which requires a single method for editing that String. Now, Id like to have the user be able to insert a Jar file into a folder packaged with the program and my program reads it in, and uses it as a class which implements the interface which I created. So basically I am looking for a way of reading in a jar files contents, and using its class as one of my programs classes. Apologies in advanced for any incorrect terminology, I am very new to this. If this is the wrong way to approaching the problem let me know, Im open to a better way.
