Positive 1 pI need to define a layout page. Currently I have index.cshtml and I am using ngroute. But on opening any opening any other link and after refreshing all the master contents of Index.cshtml are removing. How can I use layout page with angularjs appp
Positive 1 pI have three assemblies. A main executable, a common library and an extension. In the extension, I need to implement a certain interface coming from the common assembly in order to register the class as a service in a static codeKernelcode class. p  pThe only problem, I dont have access to some types needed to implement the interface. For instance, the interface codeAcode has a method codeDoWorkcode that has a return type codeBcode. The extension assembly doesnt have the codeBcode type in its references and it cannot be added. p  pIs there a way to implement the interface, make the method throw a codeNotImplementedExceptioncode and have the extension assembly compilep  pNote, the main assembly needs to reference the extension in order to register it, so I cant reference the main assembly in the extension and declare the type in the main one.p

Positive 1 pGiven a database schema with two tables codeCompanycode and codeEmployeecode, where the codeEmployeecode table has a foreign key to the codeCompanycode table, what is the correct code to change the company a particular employee is associated withp  pstrongMethod 1strongp  precodecompany1.Employees.Removeemployee company2.Employees.Addemployee codepre  blockquote   pstrongProblemstrongp      pThis appears to work but is horribly inefficient as the reference to codecompany1.Employeescode loads all of the employees for codecompany1code, and the reference to codecompany2.Employeescode loads all of the employees for codecompany2code.p blockquote  pstrongMethod 2strongp  precodeemployee.Company  company2 codepre  blockquote   pstrongProblemstrongp      pRaises the exception emMultiplicity constraint violated.

It still has the value it had previously.p blockquote  pIm working with welltested code in a large application that uses my emMethod 1em and I am trying to optimize it after performance issues have been found. I understand there may be other factors that influence the results I am getting. I am looking for someone with more insight into the inner workings of Entity Framework to suggest how they would approach this.p  hr  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIve now been told by more than one person that my emMethod 1em does not load all related employees. But I have run multiple tests on this that show that it does. Ive even created a simple test application. Here is my code.p  precodevar website  context.Websites.FirstOrDefault var ranking  website.Rankings.FirstOrDefault codepre  pSeems that some people assume the second line will only load one row from the codeRankingscode table. However, here are the queries generatedp  precodeSELECT TOP 1  [c].[ID] AS [ID],  [c].[Title] AS [Title],  [c].[URL] AS [URL],  [c].[AliasForID] AS [AliasForID],  [c].[ActiveState] AS [ActiveState],  [c].[Alert] AS [Alert] FROM [dbo].[Website] AS [c] codepre  pAndp  precodeexec spexecutesql NSELECT  [Extent1].[ID] AS [ID],  [Extent1].[WebsiteID] AS [WebsiteID],  [Extent1].[PageRank] AS [PageRank],  [Extent1].[AlexaRank] AS [AlexaRank],  [Extent1].[AlexaReach] AS [AlexaReach],  [Extent1].[DateAdded] AS [DateAdded] FROM [dbo].[Ranking] AS [Extent1] WHERE [Extent1].[WebsiteID]  EntityKeyValue1,NEntityKeyValue1 int,EntityKeyValue11 codepre  pNote the second query. It returns all rows from the codeRankingcode table that are linked to the codeWebsitecode entity. It does not filter to return only the first row. In the same way, accessing codecompany1.Employeescode to call the codeAddcode method will load all employees related to codecompany1code because codeWebsite.Rankingscode is of type codeICollectionltgtcode and not codeIQueryableltgtcode.p  pLazy loading is completely unrelated. Lazy loading simply means that the collection is not loaded until the code references this collection or any other property that refers to data from a related table. But once the code references this collection, all related entities are loaded.p  pI would love someone to show me how this is untrue or how to prevent this. So far, the only people who are saying it is untrue are not willing to back it up andor just insult me when I asked them to back up their claims. Not understanding how this works can lead to major performance problems.p

Positive 1 pIm working with some unmanaged type libraries and reference files in a C .NET application to get information out of them, such as the interfaces, functions, enums, etc, that they contain. I currently have an object of type ComTypes.ITypeInfo that represents a coclass. Ive already written some code to get the coclasss name, however what I really want is a list of all the names of the interfaces contained within that coclass.

Positive 1 pI have a Visual Studio 2015 solution with 3 C projects that depend on each otherp  pProject A  Project B  Project Cp  pI would like each of these projects to have their own independently versioned NuGet packages in TeamCity. I also would like to automatically build and publish NuGet packages for downstream projects. p  pFor example, assuming all projects start at version 1.0.0.1, if Project A is updated from v1.0.0.1 to v1.0.0.2, then Project B should be incremented to v1.0.0.2 and rebuilt to reference Project A v1.0.0.2, which in turn triggers Project C to be incremented to v1.0.0.2 and rebuilt to reference Project A v1.0.02 and Project B v1.0.02.p  pBut if Project C is updated from v1.0.0.2 to v1.0.0.3 in isolation, then neither Project A nor Project B should be built and their versions numbers should not be incremented.p  pI am aware of the IncludeReferencedProjects NuGet option, but I am not sure how to prevent TeamCity from patching the AssemblyVersionInfos of upstream projects. p  pIs there a good way to do this in TeamCity or is there an alternative solution to my problemp

Positive 1 pIn Npgsql V2, I could use the following code to update a record, and return the updated record values using a single Npgsql command.p  pThe codecommand.CommandTextcode property contains both an UPDATE statement and also a SELECT statement. The idea being that when codecommand.ExecuteReadercode is called both commands will run, but the results from the SELECT command will be returned since it was the last command.p  pAfter upgrading to Npgsql version 3 the value in the datareader from the SELECT statement is still the original value, and not the updated one the codeReturn dractioncode line in the code. I have tried every different IsolationLevel and they all give the same results as though the SELECT statement is not seeing the updated value from the INSERT statement. The value is properly updated in the database if I requery the record it has the updated value.p  pI can split this and use two separate NpgsqlCommand one for the INSERT, and a second for the SELECT, but I dont want to create a second roundtrip to the server.p  pThis is a simplified function, the purpose of the real function is to update a record on the DB server, and then update the object in the application with any other fields that the server updated such as the lastupdated timestamp field which is updated on the server each time a record is updated.p  pIs there a way to make this work with Npgsql V3p  precodePublic Function UpdateRecordExampleid As Guid, newAction As String As String         Using conn As New NpgsqlConnectionConnection String Here             Using trans  conn.BeginTransactionIsolationLevel.ReadUncommitted                 Dim command  conn.CreateCommand                 command.UpdatedRowSource  UpdateRowSource.FirstReturnedRecord                 command.CommandText  Update pm.actionitem SET actionaction WHERE idid SELECT  FROM pm.actionitem WHERE idID                 command.Parameters.AddNew NpgsqlParameterid, id                 command.Parameters.AddNew NpgsqlParameteraction, newAction                 Using dr  command.ExecuteReader                     If dr.Read Then                         Return draction This is still the original value and not newAction                     Else                         Throw New DBConcurrencyException                     End If                 End Using             End Using         End Using     End Function codepre
Positive 1 pI have a C desktop application, which needs to make multiple simultaneous http requests to the same web server. Heres the test I performed to check whether my requests actually do happen simultaneouslyp  ol lipOn the web server, created a test page that sleeps for 3 seconds simulates some longrunning task, then returns current datetime. Heres the code VB.Netp  pltsystem.threading.thread.sleep3000ltnow pli lipIn the C app, I have a function MakeRequest which uses System.Net.Http.HttpClient to make a web request, and returns the response as string.pli lipThen in the C app theres a function invoked by a button click, that calls MakeRequest multiple times asynchronouslyp  pvar responses  await Task.WhenAllMakeRequest, MakeRequest, MakeRequest pli ol  pIn the above example, MakeRequest is called 3 times. What I see on the web server when I monitor the Requestssec performance counter, is that it gets 2 requests, and then 3 sec later 1 more request. Thats by design, because the default value for System.Net.ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit is 2, so my C app can only send 2 requests at a time, though I asked for 3. Overall time the C app took to complete the button click was 6 sec.p  pNow in the C app, I set ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit  1000000. This time Requestssec on the web server shows 3, and the button click in the C app completes in 3 seconds. All good so far.p  pNext I change the C app to make 60 simultaneous calls rather than 3. Thats where things get interesting. When I click the button, I expect to see Requestssec on the web server to spike to 60, and the C app to complete the button click in 3 sec. What I get instead is web server Requestssec showing something like 5, after 3 seconds 5 more, etc., until all 60 requests have been made. When I click the button again, the same picture except for Requestssec spike to 10 or 15, and the button click obviously completes faster. Click again  this time Requestssec show two spikes to 30, and the button click completes in 6 sec. Subsequent button clicks result in the Requestssec spiking first to 40 then to 20 for the total of 60 requests, then 50 and 10, then maybe 55 and 5, and eventually my C app starts sending all 60 requests in one go. The button click completes in 3 sec, and Requestssec on the web server shows one spike to 60. If I continue pushing the button, I consistently get all 60 requests being made simultaneously.p  pBut thats not all. If I stop pushing the button, my C app seems to forget its previous achievement. I do not restart the app, just stop pushing the button for a minute, and on the next push I go back to 5 requests at a time, and the above scenario would repeat if I keep pushing the button continuously.p  pI also performed the above test from MVC  just copied and pasted the code from the C app to a MVC page. Got exactly the same result.p  pCan anyone please explain whats going on Thank youp

Positive 1 pI see a previous post with the same question from over a year ago, but no correct answer posted.p  pOn Thursday morning, I tried to access my fb acct as I always do about 20 times everyday for years now. I received a mssg Sorry, something went wrong. We are working to fix it.  The help button does nothing. I have cleared my browser cache on IE v 11 Nokia win 8.1 ph. I have deleted the fb app from the ph and redownloaded it with same results when trying again. I have used IE v11 on laptop win 8.1, pending win 10 with same results. I have gone to help center, yet the moment acct credentials are entered, the same results. I have created a new fb acct and gone to help center, but probably ip address causing same results. I have used new fb acct to report a problem or bug with no response. I am regularly receiving text and email alerts that someone in Houston, TX is accessing my original acct, however, when I select to view the activity contest or report it wasnt me, I get the same message that something went wrong again. I was able to change the password to the original account, how can this be. I have access to the credentials, but upon logging in, I continue to get the mssg. I have searched online for answers, seeing the question over and over. Some answers indicate account blocked or suspended, based on the fact other people continue to use their accounts fine. I have searched online for answers as to how to tell I your account was suspended, and have received no answers. Noone seems to know. I have been unable to locate an email address for facebook to report the problem, ofcourse no ph number either.  I realm want my account back as my life is on it, watching my kids grow and sharing it with friends for years, my extended family communicates on it, my marriage and life documented on my fb wall. My husband can see and still post to my fb wall.  Please assist me in finding out where the problem lies. I want to say that its a fb server issue, but theres no real evidence of it.  Please help.p

Positive 1   pGreetings everyone,p  pI am developing a strategy game in C and while I was working on UI behaviour, I thought about a construction that allows code being written like thisp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeThis is running in a parallel thread.  Vector2 targetPosition  UI.ChoosePosition waits for position being picked tank.GoTotargetPosition instructs the tank to go to that position codepre  pThe code above is running in a seperate thread than the main UpdateDraw loop. For clarity I will call the thread with the UpdateDraw loop the main thread, and the thread that runs the above code will be called parallel thread It is never actually run simultaneously to the main thread  a construction of semaphores allows me to give the control to the parallel thread and back to the main thread as soon as the parallel thread is waiting. As long as the parallel thread is working, the main thread is waiting.p  pThe current thread stops when ChoosePosition is called and continues when a position is picked and the main thread allows it to continue running. All this works great, and I am quite content how clean the code looks. You can simply read it from top to bottom, which is far worse when such behaviour is programmed into an Update method that runs in a loop.p  pYou see that I dont actually need threads for this  I just want to have multiple stacks at once. The part about threads that cares about speeding up programs through parallel code execution is irrelevant for me. I guess that this causes some overhead, as I have to wait for the OS to switch to the parallel thread and back. I am not quite sure how much overhead though.p  pNow I thought about using a similar construction for unit behaviour, which would allow me to write code of similar cleanness, e. g. like thisp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeShooting behaviour of the tank. Again, this is running in a parallel, but synchronized thread. whiletarget.IsAlive ampamp tank.IsDisrupted      tank.TurnTurrettargetDirection suspends current thread until turret is turned correctly     tank.WaitForShotReady suspends thread again     tank.Shoot     soundSystem.StartSoundEffecttankshooting     particleSystem.EmitParticlestank.TurretMuzzlePosition  codepre  pThe problem is that this would require an own stack for every active unit, and that means an own thread for every active unit. Aditionally, as stated above, I fear some OS overhead from the thread switching. This leads me to my first questionp  h2Is there a class in the .NET framework that allows me to have a seperate stack without having the overhead of a threadh2  psupsubStack obviously referring to the call stack, and not to the data structure.subsupp  pAFAIK the strongThreadPoolstrong and strongTaskstrong classes which internally either uses a new thread or the ThreadPool are not suited for longrunning tasksthreads as they provide a limited number of threads and therefore a limited number of stacks. According to MSDN, a task marked as longrunning just creates a thread in the background.p  pOf course I benchmarked the performance implications of running a lot of threads that are not in the readyqueue. It turns out that they are quite acceptable the creation of 10k threads takes a bit under a second, and as I can reuse threads for new units once an old one dies, this performance overhead comes only at loading time. The frame time overhead of 10k threads seems to be about 12 ms per frame although I tested with a very high framerate, Im not sure how this scales, which isnt that great, but probably acceptable, considering 10k units will require a lot of performance anyway and therefore be more like the upper bound of units existing simultaneously.p  pAnd before you ask yes, memory consumption was a few hundred megabytes, but thats relatively low compared to the memory the rest of the game requires. Its not designed for lowend computers anyway  p  pSo my result is basically Performance overhead is not great, but acceptable even with threads. But The performance was terrible like, literally a hundred times worse when I ran the benchmark with Visual Studio debugging, because the VS 15 UI displays all the threads and a lot of threadrelated events. I like this behaviour in general, because it makes debugging multithreaded applications much easier, but when displaying emtheseem threads, performance is kill. So my second question which would be answered by the first one, too isp  h2Is there a possibillity to hide a thread from Visual Studioh2  pYou might now argue that threads are not made for mass production and constant blocking, and that this approach is an abuse of threads. That might be true, but there are several reasons against thisp  ol liMy task manager shows me more than 1.5k threads running right now, while just having a browser and Visual Studio open. This doesnt seem to cause any performance issues, and I bet that most of these threads are not in the ReadyQueue but are currently blocking. I cant look it up in the Windows task manager, but when using htop on Linux its visible that most threads are not actually doing anything. Not only my benchmarks, but the system I use everyday shows me that having a lot of idle threads in the background is no problem at all.li liMSowned Windows Forms works in a kind of similar way when a dialog box is opened, the current thread stops, but certain OS threads keep the window semiresponsive make noise when clicked. This requires a vastly smaller amount of threads though.li liEven if threads are not really designed for this use case, they might still work just fine. If you say dont use threads, they arent made for this, I would prefer a reason that refers to the properties of the concept or implementation of the thread, and not to the incentive of the author of threads  because an incentive alone doesnt neccesarily break anything li ol  pI guess that I am not the only person on earth encountering this kind of situation. Is there maybe a pattern that could be applied here p  pI know that I could probably use some scripting engine. But I really like C and its ecosystem, and I would like to not have even more external dependencies.p

Whats the procedure  I need some nittygritty kind of help.p  pDo I start a fresh C solution, and only have the CustomVisualFrameworkElement there  Where in Solution Explorer do I put the DLL  Why cant I just compile the C code and have XAML reference it  Where can I find the created DLL  Is it in the bin or debug folder  p
Positive 1 pIm trying to add my first CLR routine to SQLServer 2008 will upgrade to 2014 soon.

Negative 1 pI am developing a JSF web application on a Windows box using Emacs as my editor but I far prefer to use Emacs in a Linux environment.  In the somewhat distant past it was a nobrainer to use a remote X display to accomplish this very useful programming aid.  Cygwin helps out somewhat but true remote X is the preferred solution.  However, in recent Fedora and Ubuntu distros, remote X is a royal pain in the butt Google remote X or XDMCP and you will see there are now many configuration settings for GDM, XDM and KDM not to mention xhost and the firewall configurations that make remote X more difficult than convincing Barry Kelley that this type of question is TRULY programming related.p  pNow, I am running Fedora 10 with an XFCE environment and KDM as my display manager.  I have turned the firewall off, selinux off, enabled XDMCP in etckdekdmkdmrc, but I still get Cant open display when testing using Cywin  export DISPLAY myfedora10box0.0 xclock.  The test works fine when I remote display to another windows box running CygwinX.  So the problem is clearly a configuration setting in Fedora 10. p

Negative 1 pIve been using yuicompressor.jar on my test server for onthefly minimisation of changed JavaScript files. Now that I have deployed the website to the public server, I noticed that the servers policies forbid the use of exec or its equivalents, so no more java execution for me.p  pIs there a decent onthefly JS compressor implemented in PHP The only thing resembling this that I was able to find was Minify, but its more of a fullblown compression solution with cache and everything. I want to keep the files separate and have the minimised files follow my own naming conventions, so Minify is a bit too complex for this purpose.p  pThe tool, like yuicompressor, should be able to take either a filename or JavaScript as input and should either write to a file or output the compressed JavaScript.p  pEDIT To clarify, Im looking for something that does not have to be used as a standalone i.e. it can be called from a function, rather than sniffing my GET variables. If I just wanted a compressor, Minify would obviously be a good choice.p  pEDIT2 A lot has changed in the five years since I asked this question. Today I would strongly recommend separating the frontend workflow from the server code. There are plenty of good tools for JS development around and except for the most trivial jQuery enhancements its a better idea to have a full workflow with automated bundling, testing and linting in place and just deploy the minified bundles rather than the raw files.p

Negative 1 pIm having trouble building an Entity Framework LINQ query whose select clause contains method calls to nonEF objects.p  pThe code below is part of an app used to transform data from one DBMS into a different schema on another DBMS.

My DBMS has no idea how to call a method on a Dictionary class, but why cant EF simply make those Dictionary method calls after its already pulled data from the DB  Sure, if I wanted to compose multiple EF queries together and put custom .NET code in the middle, Id expect that to fail, but in this case the .NET code is only at the end, so why is this a problem for EF  I assume the answer is something like that feature didnt make it into EF 1.0 but I am looking for a bit more explanation about why this is hard enough to justify leaving it out of EF 1.0.p

Negative 1 pIm trying to implement a Blind Source Separation BSS algorithm and Im running into trouble determining the efficacy of the algorithm. p  pIm trying to create test cases where I work backwards and start with a signal vector bsb, which is normally unknown, and then create a mixing matrix bAb, which I use to transform bsb to create the observation vector bxb, which is what is normally observed by things like sensory equipment. Therefore I have a model that looks like p  pbx  A  sb. p  pI then put bxb into the BSS algorithm and get bsb, which is a reconstruction of the signal vector. p  pNow this is where I have a lot of problems how can I compare bsb and bsb, and get a iquantitative measurei of how similar the two vectors are The algorithm I am studying can only reconstruct the signal vector up to a negative sign therefore it is possible for bsb to be similar to bsb, or stated in another way, for bsb to be similar in shape to bsb but flipped and cannot guarantee the preservation of the amplitudes of the signals. So I want to compare the shapes of the signals to each other, while also anticipating the fact that while their shapes might be similar, they might be flipped.p  pJust to clarify, when I say signal, I really mean a matrix that could be something like 50 x 10000 50 different channels with 10000 data points taken over time. Another problem that arises from the BSS algorithm is that the ordering of the channels is not guaranteed to be preserved. So given s1, s2, s3, ... , sN, which would be the different channels of bsb, might be reconstructed again, perhaps flipped and of different amplitudes compared to the original channels in bsb, but the ordering is not guaranteed to be preserved. So s1 might correlate instead to s23, and s2 to s5, and so on and so forth. p  pSo I was wondering if theres a fast and efficient way of comparing the similarity between two different matrices, which are assumed to be composed of vectors that should correlate to one another, although not in the same order, sign, or amplitude. p  pWhat would be the best way to solve this Appreciate the helpp

Negative 1 pI didnt figure out a better title for the question. Let me explain it better nowp  pThe project I am working on is going to connect to a remote server, encrypt the session and sendreceive data packets. Id like to make it modular enough, so I thought itd be nice to use 3 distinct classes. These would bep  p1 A socket wrapper class with some virtual methods such as OnReceivedData and OnConnected.p  p2 An inherited class of the socket wrapper, implementing the encryption of data before it is sent and decrypting data on its arrival.p  p3 The main object itself, which should override any one of the above classes depending upon its need to be encrypted or not, so it could receive the OnReceivedData and OnConnected events notification as well and act based upon it.p  pSo the problem is HOW do I make my program to know it has to first call the event on the encryption object and then call that same event on the main object Because I guess if I override the socket wraper with the encryption and then override the encryption with the main object, it will probably just call the main object method it would call the OnReceivedData directly on the main object, not passing through the decryption object first, right.p  pIs this called multiple inheritancep  pBTW if you think it is a bad project design, I would appreciate any better approaches.

They said I should always join customer.id[serial] to transactions.id[integer]. p  pWhen a customer pawns merchandise, clerk queries the master using wildcards on name. The query usually returns several customers, clerk scrolls until locating the right name, enters a D to change to detail transactions table, all transactions are automatically queried, then clerk enters an A to add a new transaction.p  pThe problem with using customer.id joining transaction.id is that although the customer table is maintained in sorted name order, clustering the transaction table by fkid groups the transactions by fkid, but they are not in the same order as the customer name, so when clerk is scrolling through customer names in the master, the system has to jump allover the place to locate the clustered transactions belonging to each customer. As each new customer is added, the next id is assigned to that customer, but new customers dont show up in alphabetical order. I experimented using id joins and confirmed the decrease in performance. p  pThe drawbacks of using name joins vs. id joins is if you change customer name, the join with their transactions is severed, so I dont allow updating the name. Anyway, how often does one need to change a customers name The other draw back is name requires 30 chars where id is INT, so .dat and .idx are larger. Every morning an sql proc is executed which unloads customer and transactions in sorted name order, dropsrecreates the tables, loads the unloaded data and all indexes are recreated which keeps performance optimized. p  pHow can I use id joins instead of name joins and still preserve the clustered transaction order by name if transactions has no name column p  pThe following is an example of how the data sits in customer.dat and transactions.dat when using pkfk name, as described in the above schemap  precodecustomer.id customer.pkname               transaction.fkname            transaction.ticketnumber               2ACEVEDO BERMUDEZ, FRANCISCO J.

Then the clerk will press D to make transactions the active table and press A to add a new transaction, or clerk may scroll through all the customers transactions to update one in particular or just provide customer with info. p  pWhen using the pkfk name method, as the clerk scrolls through customer names to locate the desired customer, response is immediate. Whereas when using the pkfk id method, response time lags, even with supported indexing, because the engine has to jump to different locations in the transactions table to locate the corresponding group of transactions belonging to each customer as clerk scrolls through each customer name in the master p  pSo, it seems like having the customers transaction rows grouped together and in the same sorted order as the customer rows allows the indexing to locate the transactions quicker as opposed to having to jump all over scattered groups of each customers transactions. If each customer could remember their customer i.d. number, then my issue would be academic, but in the realworld, we even gave each customer an i.d. card with their customer number on it, but most of them lost their cardsp  pHeres an example of the daily reorg executed every morning before pawnshop opens for business p  precode ISQLSE customer and transactions table reorg  oncedaily, before start of       business, procedure   unload to UUNLCUSTOMERS.UNL     select  from customer   order by customer.pkname    unload to UUNLTRANACTIVES.UNL      select  from transaction where transaction.status  A    order by transaction.fkname, transaction.trxdate    unload to UUNLTRANINACTIVES.UNL      select  from transaction      where transaction.status  A         and transaction.trxdate gt today  365    order by transaction.fkname, transaction.trxdate desc    unload to UUNLTRANHISTORIC.UNL      select  from transaction       where transaction.status  A         and transaction.trxdate lt today  365    order by transaction.trxdate desc    drop table customer        drop table transaction   create table customer     id serial,   pkname char30,   [...]     in SPAWNSHOP.DBSCUSTOMER    create table transaction      fkname char30,   ticketnumber serial,   trantype char1,    status char1,    trxdate date,    [...]    in SPAWNSHOP.DBSTRANSACTION    load from UUNLCUSTOMERS.UNL      insert into customer     gt4800 nrows  load from UUNLTRANACTIVES.UNL   insert into transaction 500600 nrows avg.   load from UUNLTRANINACTIVES.UNL insert into transaction 65007000 nrows avg.   load from UUNLTRANHISTORIC.UNL  insert into dsshistoricgt500K nrows    create unique cluster index custpknameidx on customerpkname  create        cluster index trancustidx    on transactionfkname    this groups each customers transactions together, actives in    oldest trxdate order first, then inactive transactions within the last year in most     recent trxdate order. inactives older than 1 year are loaded into historic     table in a separate database, on a separate hard disk. historic table     optimization is done on a weekly basis for DSS queries.    create unique index tranticketnumidx on transactionticketnum   create        index trantrxdateidx   on transactiontrxdate   create        index transtatusidx     on transactionstatus   [...]   [grant statements...]    update statistics  codepre  pIf you have time, I CHALLENGE ANYONE TO TEST THIS..

I have enhanced the code so that I can search and replace the necessary content using regular expressions.

For instance, if I replace a 1 with a 2 everything works.  However, if I replace a 1 with a 10 thereby increasing the message size by 1 then I receive an error from ArcGIS Server that the format is unsupported.p  pThis has brought two concerns to my attentionp  ol liThe current implementation does not handle chunked requests.  That is, if the request sie is large enough Read may be called multiple times for a single request.  strongHow should chunking be handled in this scenariostrongli liWhat is the root cause of the error message Is the problem related to the content length being different than the stream length  strongHow do I correctly modify the content so that changing its length is not an issuestrongli ol  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 1 pSay I have a store that sells products that fall under various categories... and each category has associated properties... like a drill bit might have coating, diameter, helix angle, or whatever. The issue is that Id like the user to be able to edit these properties. If I wasnt interested in having the user change the properties, and I was building the store for a certain set of categories, Id have one table for drill bits, etc. Alternatively, I could just modify the schema online but that doesnt seem to be done very often unless were talking phpmyadmin or something, and plus that doesnt fit in well at all with the way models are coupled to tables.p  pIn general, Im interested in implementing a multitable database structure with various datatypes because diameter might be a decimal, coating would be a stringindex into a table, etc, within mysql.

Negative 1 pIm posting my first question here after having viewed many useful exchanges by others its very exciting  Im thinking that this question will be fairly straightforward to answer, but I hope that someone can shed some light on it since its vexing me.  p  pI have a function that accepts an array of bytes passed in as a byte pointer, multiple layers of the program lower.  The variable is a member of the class defined as p  precodemGpsInputBuf[GpsInputBuflen] codepre  pThe function in question receives a pointer to that array as shown in the code below.  The function just shifts the bytes in the array to the left when the checksum for the packet is not validated and another sync character for the data packet is located within the body of the packet.  All questions as to the purpose of the function aside though, the point that Im interested in is the copying of the temp array to the parameter byte array pointer.  p  pThe copy to the pPacketbuf variable takes place just as Id hoped, but when the function terminates, the pPacketbuf variable that exists at the calling level of the ScanAndShift function is unaffected.  This is related to the argument to ScanAndShift being a copy of the pointer variable, I believe, but Im too close to the problem to understand it right now.  Any insight  Code belowp  precodeint CFlirPumpDlgScanAndShiftBYTE pPacketbuf  int idx3  0 BYTE tempGpsInputBuf[GpsInputBuflen]  forint idx  1 idx lt GpsInputBuflen idx      ifpPacketbuf[idx]  CFlirPumpAppGPSStart              idx3  idx          forint idx2  0 idx2 lt GpsInputBuflen  idx idx2                      tempGpsInputBuf[idx2]  pPacketbuf[idx3]                   pPacketbuf  BYTE amptempGpsInputBuf         return GpsInputBuflen  idx        return 0  codepre

Negative 1 pIn my application I have a JTable and a List.p  ul lipstrongThe Liststrong The list is populated using a JPA query. The user can reexecute the query by changing attributes in the GUI. Lets assume the query has a named parameter year and the user can change this. Then the following happens simplified by leaving out exception handlingp  precodemyList.clear mylist.addAll myQuery.setParameteryear, 2010  codepre  pAs the list changes, the binding fires the required handlers and the table now reflects the new dataset.pli lipstrongThe JTablestrongp  pThe contents of the JTable come from a BeansBinding more precisely a codeJTableBindingcode. The binding source is the aforementioned list.pli ul  pThe query is only executed for intensive tasks. Like applying a rough filter on a huge dataset. The earlier example with the year is a good example. This will always return a manageable chunk of data to the client. Now, to have a more responsive user experience, more finegrained filters happen in the JTable itself. This avoids unnecessary roundtrips to the database.p  pNext, assume the following scenario A user selects a row in the table and hits the delete button.

My AndroidManifest.xml is, AFAIK, using the right permission, RECORDAUDIO I dont know how to confirm thisp  precodeltapplication androidicondrawableicon androidlabelstringappname androiddebuggabletruegt     ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.RECORDAUDIOgt     ltactivity androidname.SphinxMic               androidlabelstringappnamegt         ltintentfiltergt             ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.MAIN gt             ltcategory androidnameandroid.intent.category.LAUNCHER gt         ltintentfiltergt     ltactivitygt ltapplicationgt codepre  pI do the following to create the AudioRecordp  precodebufferSize  AudioRecord.getMinBufferSize8000, CHANNELINMONO, ENCODINGPCM8BIT audioRecorder  new AudioRecordAudioSource.MIC, 8000, CHANNELINMONO, ENCODINGPCM8BIT, 50bufferSize if audioRecorder.getState  AudioRecord.STATEINITIALIZED   throw new ExceptionAudioRecord init failed codepre  paudioRecorder.getState returns 0 ie STATEUNINITIALIZEDp  pI have not found any complete examples of using this API and Im very much an Android beginner so the solution may well be something simple.  What can I do to find out why it failsp  pA few people have asked similar questions, but they must have been having different problems than me because the fixes they approve havent helped me.  Most notably a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4161666androidaudiorecordfailstoinitializethisa.  But the approved solution is perplexing and didnt work for me anyway.  I have also tried a variety of bit rates 8000, 16000, 11025, 44100, both mono and stereo and 8 and 16 bit.  No combination comes back as successfully initialized.p
Negative 1 pThe C spec states that an argument type cannot be both covariant and contravariant at the same time.p  pThis is apparent when creating a covariant or contravariant interface you decorate your type parameters with out or in respectively.  There is not option that allows both at the same time outin.p  pIs this limitation simply a language specific constraint or are there deeper, more fundamental reasons based in category theory that would make you not want your type to be both covariant and contravariantp  pstrongEditstrongp  pMy understanding was that arrays were actually both covariant and contravariant.p  precodepublic class Pet public class Cat  Pet public class Siamese  Cat Cat[] cats  new Cat[10] Pet[] pets  new Pet[10] Siamese[] siameseCats  new Siamese[10]  Cat array is covariant pets  cats  Cat array is also contravariant since it accepts conversions from wider types cats  siameseCats  codepre
Negative 1 pI have had similar questions and concerns as to how to convert between Hibernate entities and data transfer objects to be returned by a web service as are discussed in this questionp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1086204isusingdatatransferobjectsinejb3consideredbestpracticeIs using data transfer objects in ejb3 considered best practiceap  pOne of the factors mentioned here is that if the domain model changes, a set of DTOs will protect consumers in the case of a web service.p  pEven though it seems like it will add a substantial amount of code to my project, this reasoning seems sound.p  pIs there a good design pattern that I can use to convert a Hibernate entity which implements an interface to a DTO that implements the same interfacep  pSo assuming both of the following implement Book, I would need to convert a BookEntity.class to a BookDTO.class so that I can let JAXB serialize and return.p  pAgain, this whole prospect seems dubious to me, but if there are good patterns out there for helping to deal with this conversion, I would love to get some insight.p  pIs there perhaps some interesting way to convert via reflection  Or a builder pattern that Im not thinking ofp  pShould I just ignore the DTO pattern and pass entities aroundp

Negative 1 pand thanks in advance for your time.p  pWe are using CSLA 3.5.1, although, ultimately, this problem may not have much to do with CSLA.p  pMy company has gone a long way down the road of a common modeling error and is finally having to face it. Ive simplified the domain objects below to clarify the problemp  pWe have 3 classes defined as suchp  pclass Person  BusinessBasep  pclass Student  Personp  pclass Teacher  Personp  pWe are using NHibernate for our ORM, and the Student and Teacher classes are joined subclasses of Person in our mappings we have Person, Student, and Teacher tables, using the PersonID as a derived key.p  pThe problem, as you may have anticipated, is now we have a situation where a Student can also be a Teacher. Under the current object and data models, this causes a primary key violation when we try to add a Student that is already a Teacher or viceversa.p  pQuestion One Is there any CSLA magic I can perform on the business object before saving the new record to prevent this situationp  pIf not...p  pIn researching this problem, Ive seen two suggestions to solve it, The first is to favor composition over inheritance. To my understanding, this means Student and Teacher would each contain a Person property.p  pQuestion Two In order to get this to work, is it correct to assume the Student and Teacher tables would need a foreign key into the Person table I guess I dont have a complete understanding of this solution, and would like some guidance.p  pThe second solution involves thinking of Student and Teacher as Roles a given person plays. From what Ive seen, the Person class would need a Roles collection, and link table PersonRoles is used to map the records in the Student and Teacher tables to the Person.p  pQuestions Three What do the Role base class and the PersonRoles table look like I believe the Student and Teacher subclasses would just contain their appropriate properties. Is this correctp  pAny opinions on a solution If anyone can find a fleshedout example on the web, Id love to see it.p  pThanks,p  pWill.p

Negative 1 pI have two spinner and EditText controls within a table layout view on a separate row. The spinners are populated with data. My problem is the data texts that are populated into the spinners are too lengthy to fit the screen size. Therefore, the spinners are forced to stretch unnecessarily stretching other controls on another row.p  pIts a must for me to show the texts in the spinner. Hence using ellipses is not an option. If its possible how can I wrap the lengthy text on the spinnersp

Negative 1 pThe company I work for has recently upgraded from Rails 2 to Rails 3, during the same period we also migrated from rjs to jquery. We are adopting a new pattern which is intended to improve view reusability. I will use editupdate as example to illustrate the new way and the old way of doing AJAX in the projectp  pA. strongOld waystrong  Edit action template does not render any update specific javascript logic to client. Update template renders both html content and action replace a element. this is very similar to RJS approach but in jQuery. p  pPros br  1. AJAX html content and javascript code that does the DOM manipulation are organized in same .rb file, easy to maintain.br  2. View specs can test if proper DOM manipulation js code were rendered in update AJAX response.p  pCons br  1. Because html content and js code are coupled and assume certain DOM structure on target page, its harder to reuse on a different page. p  pB. strongNew waystrong  the update action template for AJAX request only returns a JSON document, which contains escaped html content. the js code that manipulates DOM is rendered from edit action template and listening on AJAXsuccesserror virtual event. So the content and behavior are separated.p  pProsp  ol liAJAX html content and javascriptbehavior are decoupled, so the content can be tweaked and manipulated slightly different on different page.li ol  pConsp  ol lipThe html content and js code are now organized in 2 different files js in edit action template, html content in update action template, its harder to maintain than before.pli lipWe can no longer easily test view behavior  the update template now only render AJAX html content, but the code that manipulates it is in a different view edit.pli lipSince the response is in JSON format, we can no longer use format to tell if the client is expecting html wrapped in JSON or just JSON API call. p  pThese are things I have learnt so far, I am wondering if someone with more experience on this topic could shed some light on this  which approach is better in general and how to improve them.pli ol  pThanksp  pXiaotianp

Negative 1 blockquote   pstrongPossible Duplicatestrongbr   a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions350470whattoolsdoyourecommendtoprofilerailsappsWhat tools do you recommend to profile Rails appsa  p blockquote    pMy rails app is taking 2 seconds to respond to POST requests, and I cant figure out why. When I use traditional profiling tools like newrelic or things that hook into unit tests, they tell me that all of my requests are fast, taking under 20 ms. But when I actually time the requests, they are taking 2 seconds. GET requests are fast. This happens in both development and production mode, using mongrel. So my suspicion is that some gem is doing needless work. How can I track this down If this was some other sort of server rather than Rails, I would just profile the running server, but the Rails profiling solutions all seem to just profile the controller code.p

Negative 1 pI havent found any resources that exactly answer what I am trying to understand with an issue I saw in a piece of software I am working on, so Ill ask the geniuses herep  pFor starters, Im running with VxWorks on a PowerPC processor.p  pIn trying to debug a separate issue, I tried throwing some quick and dirty debug code in an interrupt handling routine. It involved a double precision floating point operation to store a value of interest namely, how long it had been since I saw the last interrupt come in which I used later outside the handler in my running thread. I didnt see a problem in this sure, it takes longer, but timewise I had pleanty the interrupts arent coming in too quickly however VxWorks sure didnt like it. It consistently crashes the when it reaches that code, one of the bad crashes that reboots the system. It took me a bit to track down the double operation as the source of the issue, and I realized its not even double operations, even returning a constant double from a routine called in the interrupt failed miserably.p  pOn PowerPC or other architectures in general are there generally issues doing floating point operations in interrupt handlers and returning floating point or other type values in functions called by an interrupt handler Im at a loss for why this would cause a program to crash.p  pThe workaround was to delay the conversion of ticks since last interrupt to time since laster interrupt until the code is out of the handler, since it seems to handle long integer operations just fine.p

Negative 1 pI have an existing code base for an embedded system with no operating system. Im trying to get it to build with the x86 gcc instead of just the cross compiler, as a first step toward being able to unit test on the host. Unfortunately there are direct register reads and writes all over the place, instead of using the provided abstraction layer. One option of course is to fix that replace the direct register access with calls to the GPIO access functions. Im hoping to get up to speed faster by introducing a macro used in the x86 build only to redefine pieces of the code like  p  precodemyvar  GPIOCgtIDR gtgt 6 amp 0x03    Read bits 6 and 7 GPIODgtCRL amp 0xFFFFFF0F codepre  pto something likep  precodemyvar  myGpiocIdrReadFunc gtgt 6 amp 0x03    Read bits 6 and 7 myGpiodClrWriteFunc amp 0xFFFFFF0F codepre  pGPIOxs are defined as pointers to a physical address. Of course if I try to read and write directly to addresses on my PC with an executable built with x86, that would be access violation. Unfortunately if I try something like thisp  precodedefine GPIOCgtIDR  myGpiocIdrReadFunc  codepre  pthe compiler doesnt like that , saying missing whitespace after the macro name.p  pIf youve solved this kind of problem before, how did you do itp

Negative 1 pI have three entities User, Office and PhoneNumber. The user has many phone numbers, and the office has many phone numbers too.p  pThe problem is how to represent these entities relations in Doctrine 2. p  ol lipAt first I tried to use bidirectional onetomany associations User  has many  PhoneNumbers Office  has many  PhoneNumbers, the PhoneNumber has two mapping fields, one for User and anotherone for Office. This solution doesnt work since one of the mapping foreign keys couldnt be null.pli lipMy second approach was to use two entities and one superclass for PhoneNumber. The PhoneNumber superclass has defined all common fields except the mapping field. Entities UserPhoneNumber and OfficePhoneNumber extended the PhoneNumber entity and specified the different mapping field and different table. one table for OfficePhoneNumbers, anotherone for UserPhoneNumbers p  pThis solution actually works, but it is quite ugly to have 3 classes to represent one simple entity.pli lipMy third approach is to use unidirectional onetomany mapping. This will eliminate the need of mapping field for the PhoneNumber entity. The problem is that when I use cascade remove for the manytomany field, it violates the integrity constraint when deleting records. p  pWhen I omit the cascade remove option, after removing User or Office, the PhoneNumber remains in the Database but the record in mapping table is removed. pli ol  pWhat is the best way to handle this type of associationp  pThanksp

Negative 1 pIn my iPhoneiPad project, Im showing some data from SQLite database. This database is under my codeSupporting Filescode folder in my Xcode project.  p  pBut my application also has a feature like embookmarkingem items. I intend to save embookmarkedem records by codeIDcode in a text file or whatever, then when user wants to see them, call the array in the text file and get the records from database.  p  pBut theres a possibility that my application might need update later. Ive been researching about it and I think I should use a web service to check the current version and notify the user that theres a new version.  p  pAnd also since the database is under my project folder, I expect the database to be modified too.  p  pSo far everythings all right, but what about my text file that I store users embookmarkedem items ids Can I copy this outside of the folder so it doesnt get updated when user installs the new version of the application Otherwise all the embookmarkedem values will be reset.  p  pBtw if theres any other effective version about releasing new versions and informing the user, Im eager to hear.

The easiest way I can see of tackling this problem is to create a constructor overload that just sets these parameters to default objects which I will probably do just to fix the issue at hand for now, but I feel so dirty doing it but I would like to get input from people on the correct way to handle this. Im relatively new to MVC. Thanks in advancep  pstrongEDITstrong I wanted to add that in my [HttpPost] methods where the processing is done, even though I am using a model for MVCs editing on the view, I am receiving back a FormCollection and use that to update the model, rather than have MVC edit the model directly.p  precode     ltsummarygt      Add this person, then go to the next page where more people can be added.      ltsummarygt      ltparam namemodelgtltparamgt      ltreturnsgtltreturnsgt     [HttpPost]     public ActionResult IndexFormCollection fc, HttpPostedFileWrapper upload           Uri requestUri  Request.Url.ToString.Contains127.0.0.1  Request.Url  new Uri...

Negative 1 pNote that Ive searched online for the warnings Im describing below, and have come up with next to nothing about them.p  pIm working with API level 10.

In fact, as long as it takes more than roughly 500 ms to run it works fine. Note that I tried using startActivityForResult to no greater effect  the same problem occurs.p  hr  pThe goal is that the user selects a preference item, they change its setting, some processing takes place, and then the user is left back at the preference menu they started on.p  pIm betting its a race condition... the order in which the windows are destroyed varies depending on that runtime... and I get the impression that when the subActivity closes before its parent ListActivity the warnings get thrown. But sprinkling a 1s sleep in isnt a reasonable solution unless this is some sort of Android bug unlikely, but then again Ive reproduced a couple of those today already.p  pstrongSo, whats the flaw in this my that leads to this stream of warningsstrong Itd be nice to say on preference, do this, then do that, then finish but I think what Im doing is the equivalent. Maybe not... thoughtsp  hr  pEdit I decided to try doing this ListActivity as a custom Dialog... that was one of the more painful things Ive tried to do lately getApplication doesnt work and lots of other things seem to go wrong... it may be inexperience to some extent, but dialogs really werent meant for this either...p
Negative 1 pI am currently doing some template metaprogramming. In my case I can handle any iteratable type, i.e. any type for which a codetypedef foo constiteratorcode exists in the same manner. I was trying to use the new C11 template metaprogramming for this, however I could not find a method to detect if a certain type is missing.p  pBecause I also need to turn onoff other template specializations based on other characteristics, I am currently using a template with two parameters, and the second one gets produced via codestdenableifcode.

For example simply doingp  precodetemplatelttypename Tgt struct FooltT, typename Tconstiteratorgt      void dostuff ...   codepre  pdid not work, because in those cases where this specialization should be used, the invalid default case was instantiated instead.p  pHowever I could not find this codeexistscode anywhere in the new C11 standard, which as far as I know simply is taking from codeboosttypetraitscode for this kind of stuff. However on the a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1470libstypetraitsdochtmlindex.htmlhomepagea for codeboosttypetraitscode does not show any reference to anything that could be used instead.p  pIs this functionality missing, or did I overlook some other obvious way to achieve the desired behaviorp

My algorithm to do it, looks like thisp  precodeint pos wordkeyt charkey wordkeyt key  0 const char raw  word.cstr  cout ltlt Entering getKey loop with  ltlt raw ltlt endl for pos  0 raw[pos]  0 pos      if raw[pos] gt A ampamp raw[pos] lt Z          charkey  raw[pos]  A      else if raw[pos] gt a ampamp raw[pos] lt z          charkey  raw[pos]  a      else          throw new runtimeerrorUnrecognised Character           key  charkey  1  powCHARSINALPHABET, pos   cout ltlt word  ltlt raw ltlt  ,score  ltlt key ltlt endl return key codepre  pIt appears to work,p  pa1 b2 ab53 ac79.p  pI believe this is correct.p  pHowever, Im having problems trying to decode it. This is my best attempt and it isnt working. I believe I need to be using pow26,position and decrementing from the end of the string but Im just struggling to achieve this.

Negative 1 pIf there are some kind of limitations for array keys in PHP  Length  Not acceptable strings p  pIn the a hrefhttpwww.php.netmanualenlanguage.types.array.php relnofollowofficial documentationa found only this, but there is no information about keys limitations.p  blockquote   pA key may be either an integer or a string. If a key is the standard representation of an integer, it will be interpreted as such i.e. 8 will be interpreted as 8, while 08 will be interpreted as 08. Floats in key are truncated to integer. The indexed and associative array types are the same type in PHP, which can both contain integer and string indices.p blockquote

Negative 1 pApparently, Windows eats my errors. Literally. I have this C .Net 4.0  VS 2010 application Im working on and it eventually crashed.

When the application was supposed to crash, it just quit, no errors, no nothing.p  pAnyway, I knew what the error was and I fixed it. It was all ok for a few days.p  pBut today, I implemented some simple threading via ThreadPool. What happens is that something crashes in my thread and heres the awesome stuffp  pVisual Studio navigates in the solution, opening the file AND THE FUNCTION which crashes, but then its strongstops shortstrong of breaking my application and showing me the error. It just opens the proper file, the proper function, and my thread quits, the progress bar on my window keeps spinning forever and thats it... stuck in limbo...p  pTo make matters even more complicated and this happens even in strongsinglethreadedstrong scenarios, check this out I tried trapping THE ENTIRE program. This should technically catch strongANYstrong error that occurs. Well guess what, it doesnt. I see no Error written in my Error Log.p  pWhats interesting is that it seems to happen only when accessing the database via my strongtyped datasets which use the MySQL libraries for .Net. Other errors are logged successfully. p  pBut I used strongthe samestrong MySQL libraries on Windows XP a few months ago and I always had all errors logged and, when debugging with Visual Studio, shown to me at runtime.p  precode  try Main application loop.

Negative 1 pI am rather new to servlets and currently Im struggling with adding cookies. I believe this is a result of a modular approach i am taking in that I built a header utility class that simply inserts all the header information into the servlet so I want to take the same approach with adding cookies. p  pI also have a crediential validator class that excepts the user name and password, validates it, then returns a validinvalid response. Here i believe lies the problem. In the login form that passes the username and password to the credential validator, I have the form action directing to the credential servlet and the form method as a post. p  pDoing it this way provides a problem if i want to send a value from the form to another servlet, or does it p  pThe goal of this project, for school, is to create a simple website strictly with servlets then we get to use JSP to ease the pain. p  pIs there another approach i should be considering Is it possible to have these classes that perform a variety of functions on forms when the form action and method are utilized p  pThank you for any help and guidance. p  pBest Ep

Negative 1 pRegarding the question on SO a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8636597howtooverloadthecallingprocessofanyfunctionHow to overload the calling process of any functiona. The accepted answer is in fact not working as is. The problem lies in the fact the passed in variable fn is a string instead of a function. But if I changed fn to NS[fn] , it would create an infinite loop. Another way is to use a var inside the for loop to keep track of the old values of foo and bar, but it wont work too because of closure. I ended up adding a new array to keep track of the old functions as belowp  precodeNS      foo  function console.logfoo ,    bar  function console.logbar     lt new code goes here  NS.foo NS.bar   new code below, that should go after definitions but before the calls  function     var pre  function console.logpre ,        post  function console.logpost      var temp  new ArrayAdded line 1     for var fn in NS        temp[fn]  NS[fn]Added line 2      original answer NS[fn]  functionfn return function pre fn post  fn       NS[fn]  functionfn return function pre temp[fn] post  fn        NS.fooAdded line 3 NS.barAdded line 4 codepre  pMy question is are there other ways to do similar thing I am not talking about a caller function as given by another answer to the quoted question.

Negative 1 pI have a project which requires creating Classes dynamically at runtime, where the only information available is the Class name in String form. Im testing right now with some dead simple Reflection library methods, but my question is, why do I have to provide a fully qualified Class name if the Classes Im trying to dynamically load are in the same directory Im using linux, no development environment, just all the Classes Im trying to invoke in the same directory with no package declarations whatsoever. Do I have to set up a package system to use Reflection Heres this little code snippet....p  precodepublic class ReflectionTest      public static void mainString[] args          try              Class nodeClass  Class.forNameNode             System.out.printlnnodeClass.toString          catch ClassNotFoundException cnfe              System.out.printlnError                codepre  pNow, this throws the error. But when I create an instance of Node, and then get its fully qualified Class name with codeNode.getClass.getNamecode, I just get Node in return. So I dont understand why the Reflection library doesnt work the same as invoking the JVM with java, where if no package name is supplied it simply looks in the same directory. Im not sure how to use this library with userdefined Classes when none of my Classes emhaveem an associated package name.p

Negative 1 pstrongExplanationstrongp  pMy app basically uses a mapview with an overlay of polygons that represent buildings, coupled with an annotation. So for this it imports a custom class called Annotation that handles the popup details when the annotation is tapped, meaning it store the buildings name and address. At this time the callout the blue disclosure button loads an empty DetailViewController object as theres not really any data to pass through.p  pI soon added a new feature in the form of a searchable table that loads custom objects of the Building class with similar properties to Annotation, plus images and more details that then loads in the aforementioned DetailViewController class with the buildings details.p  pSo to summarise, the MapVC contains multiple annotations, which when the relevant disclosure button is tapped open the DetailVC. SearchVC is accessed by a button on the MapVC and has a table of Building objects, which loads a DetailVC with the relevant data, like sop  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commVV7X.png altBasic diagram of the apps functionalityp  pstrongNext Stepstrongp  pSo now I want to implement functionality into the blue disclosure button on the callout, so when the user taps it itll load the building details. At the moment all it has is the annotations details. I could add the extra properties to the annotation to make it complete but I think its much better to just work with one custom class called Building, which has a MKAnnotation nature. Then this Building class is loaded for the annotations and searchVCs table. p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pSo finally, whats the best way to go around this I want all the data to be stored independently of any of the VCs in the diagram. I followed a tutorial from Apple the BirdSighting one which uses a separate Datacontroller class, which Id then load into other classes. Is this the best approachp

Negative 1 pI have an Android IntentService that is behaving strangely.  I am sending it an intent via a call to startServiceintent.p  pI apologize, Im away from my desk and cant paste any actual code.p  pWhen I make the above call nothing happens.  Neither the constructor nor the onHandleIntent methods are called in the Intent Service.  There are no compiler warnings or errors and I see nothing of interest in the Console or Log.p  pAs I continue to investigate this, I was just wondering if there is a short list of likely reasons why an IntentService would not start like this with no obvious evidence of why.  Is the problem likely in the manifest filep

Negative 1 pHappens with some occasion. Running Windows 8 x64, with Visual Studio 2012 Professional also happened before in VS 2010. C console project being debugged with Enable native code debugging.p  pPressing F5, debugging some code, reaching breakpoints, etc. then pressing ShiftF5 Stop Debugging and the Visual Studio does not return to editing mode as normally, it just hangs for a while and then gives an option to terminate the hanging operation dialog window strongA remote operation is taking longer than expectedstrong with progress bar and Terminate button. If I dont click to terminate, it stays there just updating the progress bar. If I click to terminate the operation, VS returns back to editable mode but the debugged process is still visible in Task Manager and its not killable. This pending debug process locks certain files it uses e.g. DLLs so further rebuild is not possible. The only way to kill this process is to restart the machine.p  pInterestingly it happens when the breakpoints are reached in debugged code and debugging is performed step by step. If I just run the debugging process without breakpoints then the hang does not occur.p  pSolutions in the following thread didnt help a hrefhttpsconnect.microsoft.comVisualStudiofeedbackdetails504538httpsconnect.microsoft.comVisualStudiofeedbackdetails504538ap

Negative 1 pI am very new to Java, I have only been studying it for a couple of weeks, and this project has me puzzled. The instructions were to create a minefield game that generates a random start point, a random finish point, and two mines. The user must navigate from start to finish without hitting a mine. My goal was to test if the user made a valid move, then change the color of the button he clicked on. Thus, making a path from start to finish. When he hit the check button, it would tell him whether or not he clicked on a hidden mine, and whether he won or lost.p  pHere is what I have so far.p  pAny help with the methods, or suggestions on how to make this more efficient would be greatly appreciated. p  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeimport java.awt.BorderLayout import java.awt.Color import java.awt.Container import java.awt.GridLayout import java.awt.event.ActionEvent import java.awt.event.ActionListener import java.util.EventObject import java.util.Random  import javax.swing.  public class MineField extends JFrame implements ActionListener      private JFrame main  new JFrameMineField Game      private JPanel top  new JPanel     private JPanel bottom  new JPanel     private int y         private int x     return the grid   public JButton[][] getGrid      return grid      param grid the grid to set   public void setGridJButton[][] grid      this.grid  grid  JButton[][] grid names the grid of buttons  public MineFieldint width, int length constructor with 2 parameters         Container container  getContentPane         container.setLayoutnew GridLayout2,1         top.setLayoutnew GridLayoutwidth,length set layout of frame         gridnew JButton[width][length] allocate the size of grid          Generates 4 random numbers for coordinates.

Negative 1 pThe collatz function a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCollatzconjecture relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiCollatzconjecturea is a function which takes an odd positive integer n to 3n1 and an even positive integer n to n2.

Negative 1 pI had an Idea and I was wondering if it was possible. Ive googled it and cant seem to find any existing solutions. I was thinking of having a Bluetooth mesh network.

My coding experience is limited to a bit of Java and mathstat languages like R and MATLAB. I have zero experience with webmobile development, servers, etc., but I am willing to learn. What Im hoping to get from this forum is not a completely specified solution, but instead just some general direction. If someone can give me a sense of how this should be done, how much work it would be, what languages I would need, etc., that would be immensely helpful.p  pTwo more things I should probably mention 1 This program is only for my personal use, so the resulting application, whether it be on my phone or desktop, can have very minimal functionality beyond the ability to sendreceive notifications. 2 If it makes things easier, I think I can eliminate the dependency on R and write everything in Java.p  pAny help will be greatly, greatly appreciated. p
Negative 1 pI wanted to know if it was possible to create a custom TextView that centers text perfectly, no matter what the font is. Thats my major issue right now, but Im also wondering if its possible to set the specific height using pixels so that the height would also be consistent. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWCj5a.png altComparing text fonts This picture shows how different fonts are sized and centered. The longest black line in the picture is the middle of the white space. Letters in the picture are the same in every way except for the fonts. The text size is the same codetext.setTextSizeTypedValue.COMPLEXUNITPX, 450code, and theyre all centered. I hope someone knows the answer to these questions If you need any code from my app, just ask. Thanksp  pEDIT I am aware of codeandroidgravityveritcalcentercode, but that only works to an extent. What you see above is that implemented in the codetextviewcode, but each font has a different center of gravity, so codeandroidgravityveritcalcentercode wouldnt really make all of these center perfectly along the screen. Im looking for a way to create a custom codetextViewcode that somehow measures the height of text and centers it with those parameters. A suggestion by vmironov in the comments works, but only if the codetextviewcode has one character. I have not been able to mess around with his code, but I will when I get a chance and Ill post here if I find anything. Thanksp

Negative 1 pMy app sometimes inserts objects into the managed object context that are not meant to necessarily be saved. For example, when I launch an add entity modal, I create a managed object and assign it to the modal. If the user saves from that modal, I save the context. If he cancels, I delete the object and no save is necessary.p  pI have now introduced an import feature that switches to my app using a URL scheme and adds an entity. Because one of these modals might be open, it is not safe to save the context at this point. The transient object created for the modal will be saved, even if the user cancels, and there is no guarantee that the deletion from the cancel operation will be saved later  the user might quit the app.p  pSimilarly, I cant simply save whenever my app quits. If the modal is open at that point, the temporary object will be incorrectly saved.p  pTo address this I am attempting to use a child context, as discussed a hrefhttpwww.cocoanetics.com201207multicontextcoredataherea. Having read all I could find on SO, I sill have a few questionsp  ol lipWhich concurrency type should I be using for each context Remember that I am not doing this for performancethreading benefits. I know I can not use NSConfinementConcurrencyType for the main context if it is to have child contexts, but Im not sure which of the other two options is best suited. For the child context, does it need to match Or can I even use the confinement type here Ive tried a variety of combinations and all seem to work ok, but I would like to know which is appropriate for my requirements.pli lipside issue Why can I only get this to work if I use a class iVar I thought I should be able to declare the temporary context in the method where it is created, and then later refer to it using entity.managedObjectContext. But it seems to be nil by the time I come to access it This is rectified if I instead use an iVar to hold the reference.pli lipWhat is the correct way or propagating the change to the main context I have seen various comments using different blockwrapped implementations on each of the contexts. Does it depend on my concurrency type My current version isp  precodesave the new entity in the temporary context NSError error  nil if [myObject.managedObjectContext saveamperror] NSLogError  unable to save new object in its temporary context  propogate the save to the main context [self.mainContext performBlock     NSError error2  nil     if [self.mainContext saveamperror2] NSLogError  unable to merge new entity into main context ] codepreli lipWhen my user saves, it sends its delegate my main view controller a message. The delegate is passed the object that was added, and it must locate that same object in the main context. But when I look for it in the main context, it is not found. The main context strongdoesstrong contain the entity  I can log its details and confirm it is there  but the address is different If this is meant to happen why, how can I locate the added object in the main context after the savepli ol  pThanks for any insight. Sorry for a long, multipart question, but I thought somebody was likely to have addressed all of these issues previously.p

Negative 1 pIve been tasked with developing a tool that scans a large collection of Java projects 7000 code.javacode files for the use of deprecated methodspropertiesAPIs. Its been specified that the tool scans in a single file at a time, performs some analysis, and outputs a list of offending files, along with the line number the deprecated piece of code appeared at. Ive been using the Eclipse JDT Java parser to effect this, however I just cant seem to figure this out.p  pBecause each file is scanned in one at a time, the compiler doesnt know which methods are deprecated and which arent, so I cant just call some codeisDeprecatedcode method and leave it at that. p  pI compiled a list of all the deprecated methods to look for in the code, and checked that against every method invocation in the code base there are a lot of them, but that was an ugly solution and produced an unacceptably large number of false positives, due to either the limitations of the parser or the limitations of my knowledge of the parser. p  pWould I be able to just build each individual project and output the compiler warnings to some code.txtcode file or something This is my first time dealing with projects of this scale so Im not really sure how stuff like this works.

Negative 1 pI am currently working on a platform which makes heavy use of dynamic byte code modification routines via the ASM library. I have been able to successfully instrument all required system classes apart from the array class. i.e String[], int[], etc this is because the array class is, itself, a dynamic type thus there is actually no class file in the rt.jar to instrument as far as im aware. p  pHowever, It did occur to me that even the array type extends java.lang.Object so although modifying the Object class would be less than ideal, not least because it would cause any changes to be propagated to all sub classes, it would possibly allow me to indirectly add an extra primitive field to the array class which, incidentally, is all im seeking to achieve.p  pAside from the obvious caveats Ive mentioned would this cause any other platform related problems p

Negative 1 pI have an android app project that uses an android lib project from third party dont have source. The ant clean release generates the apk and the app runs well. Now a java property file is added into the lib project, locates under the root of the project folder. Build and install apk, log shows the newly added property file is not loaded. Unzip and dex2jar the apk, cannot see the property file from anywhere. So seems like the property file is not included in the apk build. So my question is how to include the property file into apk, should I do anything extra Thanks for the help.p
Negative 1 pSo Ive got the template files working correctly. Sort of.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2komJ.png altenter image description herep  pThe static resource does render. But when I make changes to the file, I MUST hit save in the Modx ui before the changes show up in the output. Is there any way I can turn the cache off all together Or atleast have some kind of watch system that refreshes the cache on file save I would really like to start using modx, but so far the templating work flow is really painful.p  pThere has got to be a package for this. But so far my googling has come up short. p  pThanks SOp

Then I have a class called ItemList that extends Item and puts objects of the class Item into an ArrayList.

Does this make sense  Does anyone have any advicep

Negative 1 pI have developed serveclient model based on UDP. Client are connected to server on random basis. I mean number of clients alive at a time is not fixed.  Any new client can communicate any time. It means, there could be 1 live client or 100 clients or any number of clients.p  pNow in such model, I need to add HTTP requests. Browser could send request to server and then server will forward that to any of client based on some identification. Is there any method or readymade serverlike nginix or lighttpd, which I can use for this requirement.p  pMy big worry is that, destination client are not fixed, they keep changing. Most of server nginix or lighttd have static entries for destination address. p

How Do I manage a situation like thisp  pCan I use pub to install library D for A, B and C on my local development machine whilst it isnt published and how do I publish A, B and C when they are complete without publishing D, seen as D is not particularly useful if it isnt being used by A, B or Cp  pI have read the a hrefhttppub.dartlang.orgdoc relnofollowgetting started guidea and a hrefhttppub.dartlang.orgdocpackagelayout.html relnofollowpackage structurea documentation but neither seemed to cover this type of situation, i.e. how to manage private libraries.

Negative 1 pI am trying to strip the symbols so that we can distribute our code to external developers without disclosing our functionality. We are in the process of hiding our symbols so that when we issue nm command, the symbols shud not be visible. The idea is to give a static library with all the symbols hidden except for very few ones. I am able to create a shared library with all the symbols stripped. But i am unable to get it for a static library. I tried following the below link but was unsuccessful,p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3276474symbolhidinginstaticlibrariesbuiltwithxcodegccSymbol hiding in static libraries built with Xcodegccap  pI have two files file1.c and file2.c and file1.c makes a function call to file2.c. I want to hide the some  symbols in file2.c. If I use the ld r option, i am still able to see the symbols when i use nm command. I have tried using the strongattributestrongvisibilityhidden before the function which I want to hide. Can anyone please tell me the exact steps to get a .o file which will have the symbols stripped but internally linked.p

For example JQuery calles codewindow.setTimeoutcode  so even if my code called codeJQuerycode from within angular context the timeout callback is called in non angular context and my codewatchcode callback will not be executed afterwards.p  pBy the way, even angular themselves call codewindow.setTimeoutcode in their codeAnimatorServicecode...p  pemstrongSo my question isem  How can I make sure a codedigestcode cycle is always performed after any code is executed even when the code is a 3rd party code...strongp  pI thought about overriding the original codewindow.setTimeoutcode method butp  ul liIt feels a bit ugly and dangerous.li liIm afraid it wont cover all use cases.li ul  pAdding a a hrefhttpplnkr.coedit2MMpqtIclepYw67MmtKDppreview relnofollowplunkera. The plunker sample containsp  ul liAn element which can be hidden using JQuery codefadeOutcode method.li liA button which executes the codefadeOutcode call for hiding the element.li liA text showing the element display status codeShowncode or codeHiddencode. This text is updated by codewatchcodeing on the element codedisplaycode property.li liA button which does nothing but to initiate some angular code so that a codedigestcode cycle is called.li ul  pstrongFlowstrongp  ul liClick the codeFade Outcode button  the element will be hidden but the status text will remain codeShowncode. You can wait forever now  orli liClick the codeDo Nothingcode button  suddenly the text will change.li ul  pstrongWhystrongp  pWhen clicking the codeFade Outcode button codeJQuery.fadeOutcode calls the codewindow.setTimeoutcode method. After that my codewatchcode callback is called but the element is still not hidden. The element is only hidden after the timeout callback is called  but then there is no codedigestcode cycle and i have no way that i know of to trigger one. Only on the next time an angular code will run my codewatchcode function will be called again and the status will be updated.p

FireGetImageViewCallback returns an UIImageView via a delegate which I set in the classs constructor. Cache is a Dictionary , locker is just an object, rwl is a ReaderWriterLock instance.p

Negative 1 pSo I have a number of different potential object that can output data strings. What I want to be able to do, is to Run a generic Output.WriteLine function, with the potential arguments that define where you want it to be outputted to. What Ive got for code  p  precodeDefined in static class Const public enum Out  int  Debug  0x01, Main  0x02, Code  0x04   static class Output      private static Listltobjectgt RetrieveOutputMechanismsConst.Out output              Listltobjectgt result  new Listltobjectgt      if DEBUG         if bitmaskoutput, Const.Out.Debug             result.Add1Console I want to add Console here, but its static     endif         if bitmaskoutput, Const.Out.Main             if Program.mainForm  null                 result.AddProgram.mainForm.Box          if bitmaskoutput, Const.Out.Code             if Program.code null                 result.AddProgram.code.Box          return result           public static void WriteLineColor color, string str, Const.Out output  Const.Out.Debug amp Const.Out.Main              Console.WriteLine         Listltobjectgt writers  RetrieveOutputMechanismsoutput         foreach object writer in writers             writer.WriteLinestr, color       codepre  pThe point of this, is that the output destinations are not always existent, as they are on forms that may or may not exist when these calls are called. So the idea is to determine which ones youre trying to print to, determine if it exists, add it to the list of things to be printed to, then loop through and print to all of them if they implement the WriteLine method. p  pThe two problems that Ive come across, arep  ol liThat Console is a static class, and cant properly as far as my knowledge goes be added to the object list.li lipI dont know how I can assert that the objects in the list define WriteLine, and cast them to something that would apply to more than one base Type. Assuming I can get Console to work properly in this scheme, that would be the obvious problem, its not of the same base type as the actual Boxes, but also, if I had something that wasnt a Box, then it would be lovely to do something like p  pforeach object writer in writers     .WriteLinestr, colorpli ol  pso that I wouldnt have to individually cast them.p  pThe bigger reason that I dont simply WriteLine from the RetrieveOutputMechanisms function, is that I want this to cover more than just WriteLine, which means that I would need to copy the bitmask code to each function.p  pEDIT I realise that adding public properties to Program is a bad idea, if you know how I can avoid it the necessity coming from needing to be able to access any WriteLineable form objects that come and go, from anywhere, by all means please elaborate.p
Negative 1 pIve seen a number of SO posts about this with no resolution. p  pI have one subversion repository, hosting multiple projects. I would like to migrate one of those projects to git while preserving a history that contains branch, tag and trunk copies.p  pThis one project originally had the structurep  precoderoot    dir       mod1          trunk          branches          tags       mod2          trunk          branches          tags       ... codepre  pInitially these projects were developed as independent projects, but turns out that they are more related than we originally thought and we decided to reorganize by copying all the individual trunk, branches and tags directories to be right under codedircode to look likep  precoderoot    dir       trunk          mod1          mod2          ...       branches       tags codepre  pMy codegit svn clonecode looks likep  precodegit svn clone nometadata ltsvnurlgtrootdir s gitsvnclone codepre  pAfter that finishes and I clean up my branches and tags as per a hrefhttpgitscm.combookenGitandOtherSystemsMigratingtoGit relnofollowthisa, but when I do a codegit logcode, I only see history starting at the point at which that branchtagstrunk was copied in svn.p  pIve tried codegit log followcode but that doesnt work. Ive tried the codeM C and findcopieshardercode options and they all show the same thing.p  pId have thought that by making sure that I cloned all the branches, tags and trunks, that git would be able to find the parents from which directories were copied.p  pIs what I want simply not possible It wouldnt be the worst thing in the world to not have the history but it would be nice.p

Negative 1 pFirst let me explain the current situationp  pWe do have several codepythoncode applications which depend on custom not public released ones as well as general known packages. These depedencies are all installed on the codesystem pythoncode installation. Distribution of the application is done via codegitcode by source. All these computers are hidden inside a corporate network and dont have internet access.p  pThis approach is bit pain in the ass since it has the following downsidesp  ul liLibs have to be installed manually on each computer li ul  pHow to better deploy an application I recently saw codevirtualenvcode which seems to be the solution but I dont see it yet.p  pcodevirtualenvcode creates a clean codepython instancecode for my application. How exactly should I deploy this so that usesrs of the software can easily start itp  pShould there be a startup script inside the application which creates the codevirtualenvcode during startp  pThe next problem is that the computers dont have internet access. I know that I can specify a custom location for packages network share but is that the right approach Or should I deploy the zipped packages toop  pWould another approach would be to ship the whole python instance So the user doesnt have to startup the codevirutalenvcode In this python instance all necessary packages would be preinstalled.p  pSince our apps are fast growing we have a fast release cycle 2 weeks. Deploying via codegitcode was very easy. Users could pull from a codestablecode branch via an update script to get the last release  would that be still possible or are there better approachesp  pI know that there are a lot questions. Hopefully someone can answer me r give me some advice.p
Negative 1 pI am implementing my own diff in c using the LCS algo. When looking at the LCS algo paper and trying to find the SES  shortest edit script  there are sometimes when you get a change for a line. In the following graph example it shows only inserts and deletes.  Therefore traversing the graph backwards you have horizontal lines are deletes and vertical lines are inserts. What is the case where you have a c change case I am assuming it would be a horizontal line followed by a vertical ie delete then insert would be considered change.  I havent seen any code in C that is creating the SES directly. Maybe there is a better implementation that can get the OND or better time complexity, although I am not sure how to create the SES without creating and reversing the graph. I can implement the LCS build the graph and traverse it back I am just trying to know ahead of time whats the exact rules for creating the SES as it seems in this case you might need to maintain 2 states a delete and insert to be considered line changes  See the following files where you get a change 3,4c4,6 see below. If anyone has any sample code that is doing this such that it is maximizing run time versus space in c that would be helpful as a reference especially in regards to creating the diff output in the current diff binary form shown below.  I was using this version because I am maximizing on runtime and sacrificing space for this.p  pSee page 3 of the document with the graph of their example where they show the SES reverse of the graphp  pa hrefhttpwww.xmailserver.orgdiff2.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.xmailserver.orgdiff2.pdfap  pMy change diff example using regular diff on linuxp  precodefileA.txt a b c d e f g  fileB.txt w a b x z y e  diff fileA.txt fileB.txt  0a1 gt w 3,4c4,6 lt c lt d  gt x gt z gt y 6,7d7 lt f lt g codepre

Negative 1 pIn the project editor pane, with Build Settings selected, and with either the project or the target selected, the choices for Base SDK dont show any dropdown arrows. I can double click on the field and type any text into the box but I remember that it used to have drop down choices and the recommendation was to choose Latest iOS. But now there are no choices and apparently there is no way to enter Latest iOS. Is there some configuration option I might have changed that caused the choices to be removedp  pWhat is in the box now is the text iphoneos. By double clicking and entering various strings I see that anything is valid if it begins with iphoneos, no matter what text follows that. For example iphoneosxyzxyz is valid. But if I enter any other text for example iphone or Latest iOS and try to build I get an error that says The scheme Metronome contains no buildables that can be built for the SDKs supported by the run destination iPhone 6.1 Simulator.

Negative 1 pI have set up a rails API for my iOS application. We have a group split feature that allows people to invite people to their group and split the entire bill equally. It is currently implemented and working well but as the group size grows the time to process the transactions really slows down due to them being in a loop rather then all at once. p  pIm curious if anyone else has tackled something similar or has any resources to point me in the right direction for something like this. Currently we are placing holds on each of the group members cards and if all of the holds are successful we capture them. We do this to ensure no one in the groups card bounces, if we went straight to debiting the cards we could be liable for chargebacks if someones card did bounce. Were using the Balanced Payments ruby client.p  pI have seen the celluloid gem or sidekiq. I usually do all of the iOS work but we have been having quite a hard time getting someone good to do the API and I decided to give it a try for this app, so far so good until I encountered this problem. p  precodebooking.group.groupmembers.each do groupmember         creditcard  CreditCard.findgroupmember.creditcardid         customer  BalancedAccount.findgroupmember.user.customeruri          booking  Booking.createvenueid gt venue.id,                               userid gt groupmember.userid,                               groupid gt booking.groupid,                               subtotal gt booking.subtotal  groupcount,                               total gt booking.total  groupcount,                               gratuityfee gt booking.gratuity  groupcount,                               creditcardfee gt booking.fees  groupcount,                               creditcardid gt groupmember.creditcardid,                               receiptid gt booking.id,                   begin           hold  customer.holdamount gt booking.subtotal  booking.bookingfee  booking.gratuityfee   booking.creditcardfee  100.toint,                                 onbehalfofuri gt merchanturi,                                 appearsonstatementas gt ...,                                 sourceuri gt creditcard.creditcarduri                     rescue BalancedError gt error             handle errors             render json error.description, status error.statuscode           end         end       end codepre  pThis is how I am placing the holds on each of the cards.

Negative 1 pI am creating ASP.NET MVC applications with Visual Studio 2012 and often find myself in situation, where I need to work with two files that have the same names. When both are open, I find it hard to distinguish between two except for mouseover the tab and see the path to the file.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHdhRr.jpg altenter image description herep  pSo for two files with the name of codeIndex.cshmlcode it would be good to see in the tab codeHomeIndex.cshtmlcode and codeMenuIndex.cshtmlcode respectively.p  pPerhaps this can be achieved with some VS extension for ASP.NET. Please let me know if such display can be configured.p

Negative 1 pIm trying to build bootstrap 3 compatibility for Yesod. However, doing so by making a renderBootstrap3 function is impossible because you cant add class to inputs. So, Ive opted for making bootstrap versions of the fields in codeForm.Fieldscode. The idea is that I can clone the normal fields but add a class declaration in the attributes array. Here is the relevant codep  precodeimport qualified Yesod.Form.Fields as F  injectClass  Text gt Text gt [Text,Text] gt Either Text a gt Bool gt WidgetT HandlerSite m IO             Text gt Text gt [Text,Text] gt Either Text a gt Bool gt WidgetT HandlerSite m IO  injectClass f a b attrs d e  f a b attrs d e  textField  Monad m, RenderMessage HandlerSite m FormMessage gt Field m Text textField  addInputClass F.textField  addInputClass  Monad m, RenderMessage HandlerSite m FormMessage gt Field m a gt Field m a addInputClass f  f  fieldView  injectClass  fieldView f codepre  pSo, my intention is to take the normal version of text field and use record syntax to modify only the fieldView method. This method should be replaced by a one that is identical except for the addition of a class attribute. This is not yet implemented in the code above. It would probably look something likep  precodeinjectClass f a b attrs d e  f a b class, formcontrol  attrs d e codepre  pAnyway, the problem is that the original code wont compile. I get an equality constraint errorp  precodeCould not deduce HandlerSite m0  HandlerSite m from the context Monad m,                   RenderMessage HandlerSite m FormMessage   bound by the type signature for              addInputClass  Monad m,                                RenderMessage HandlerSite m FormMessage gt                               Field m a gt Field m a   at FieldBootstrap.hs271895 NB HandlerSite is a type function, and may not be injective The type variable m0 is ambiguous Possible fix add a type signature that fixes these type variables Expected type FieldViewFunc m a   Actual type Text                gt Text                gt [Text, Text]                gt Either Text a                gt Bool                gt WidgetT HandlerSite m0 IO  In the fieldView field of a record In the expression f fieldView  injectClass  fieldView f In an equation for addInputClass     addInputClass f  f fieldView  injectClass  fieldView f codepre  pNotice that codeFieldViewFunc m acode is defined asp  precodetype FieldViewFunc m a      Text   ID    gt Text   Name    gt [Text, Text]   Attributes    gt Either Text a   Either invalid text or legitimate result    gt Bool   Required    gt WidgetT HandlerSite m IO  codepre  pSo, Im not far off. The problem is I think that it isnt recoginizing that codeinjectClasscode doesnt change the monad. However, this should be obvious to the compiler.

Negative 1 pstrongThe Planstrongp  pThe plan Ive got is to use JQUERY to retrieve input from three fields inside the view. Then use AJAX to send that input to the controller, which in turn sends that data the model. To be used to retrieve data, send the result back to the .js file and then amend a table to display the data inside the view.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pLooking through my code, it doesnt look like the data isnt being sent from the .js file to the controller.

Some of the test classes use the a hrefhttpjunit.sourceforge.netjavadocorgjunitrunnersParameterized.html relnofollowParameterized runnera, just in case that makes a difference.

Negative 1 pIm creating an app using CakePHP and have hit a mental barrier when trying to figure out a permission system for the app. Ive narrowed it down to a couple different methods, and Im looking for some information about which would be a most easily implemented and b most efficient obviously there can be tradeoff between these two.p  pThe app has many different models, but for simplification Ill just use User, Department, and Event. I want to be able to individually control CRUD permissions for each user, on each model.p  h3Cake ACLsh3  pThough poorly documented, Ive got somewhat of an idea of how the ACL system works, and considered creating AROs as followsp  precode[1]user     create     read     update     delete [2]department     ... codepre  petc. This would require users being in emmanyem different groups, and from what Ive seen, Cake doesnt easily support this. Is there possibly a better way to do this, or is ACL not suitable for this situationp  h3Permission Flags in DBh3  pThis one is pretty straightforward, obviously having a flag in the users record for  codecreateuserscode, codereaduserscode, etc. With 45 models, this would mean 1620 fields for permissions, which made me consider either using bit masks, or using a joined table. Is one of these better than the other Which one is faster with less overhead p  pOverall, I guess I really want to know what approach makes the most sense in the scale of the application from an efficiency and easeofdevelopment standpoint. Im also open to other suggestions of how to go about this, if you have experience from a past project. Thanks in advancep

Negative 1 pThe search bar in the new Safari app shows the current URL highlighted when the search bar opens, so you can just type to replace it this is also standard feature on almost every other OS. How to make this behaviour in our own UITextFields or UISearchBarp  pThe new clearsOnInsertion   YES setting seems like it should be the answer.

Negative 1 pThis question necessarily comes in two forms, because I dont know the better route to a solution.p  pA site Im crawling kicks me to a redirected User Blocked page often, but the frequency by requeststime seems random, and they appear to have a blacklist blocking many of the open proxies list Im using through Proxymesh.  So...p  ol lipWhen Scrapy receives a Redirect to its request e.g. codeDEBUG Redirecting 302 to GET http...yougotblocked.aspx from GET http...page544.htmcode, does it continue to try to get to page544.htm, or will it continue on to page545.htm and forever lose out on page544.htm  If it forgets or counts it as visited, is there a way to tell it to keep retrying that page  If it does that naturally, then yay, and good to know...pli lipWhat is the most efficient solutionpli ol  pa What Im currently doing using a proxymesh rotating Proxy through the httpproxy environment variable, which appears to rotate proxies often enough to at least fairly regularly get through the target sites redirections.  Downsides the open proxies are slow to ping, there are only so many of them, proxymesh will eventually start charging me per gig past 10 gigs, I only emneedem them to rotate when redirected, I dont know how often or on what trigger they rotate, and the above I dont know if the pages Im being redirected from are being requeued by Scrapy...  If Proxymesh is rotating on each request, then Im okay with paying reasonable costs.p  pb Would it make sense and be simple to use middleware to reselect a new proxy on each redirection  What about on every single request  Would that make more sense through something else like TOR or Proxifier  If this is relatively straightforward, how would I set it up  Ive read something like this in a few places, but most are outdated with broken links or deprecated Scrapy commands.p  pFor reference, I do have middleware currently set up for Proxy Mesh yes, Im using the httpproxy environment variable, but Im a fan of redundancy when it comes to not getting in trouble.

Negative 1 pWhen IE11 came out it presented an interesting bug on a website WebForms .NET 2.0 Ive been working with. Ive been troubleshooting and searching for a solution for over 2 weeks now with no luck.p  pThis problem is happening only for the website Registration page. Once the user gets to the zip code look up control, the click event which is triggered by clicking FIND button positions codeltdiv idcontentshiftcode left, outside of its main container thus breaking my layout.

randomly selects one of the other items and not the one I clicked on.p  pThe weird thing is, when I attach a debugger and step trough all property settersgetters, it all works. When I run it without the debugger or do not break the issue occurs again.p  pIve put Log.Info statements all over the viewmodel property getters and setters, and it looks like that initially the correct item is selected. But after the initial setActiveAccent call it is called again with what seems to me to be a random value. As if WPF detects a second mouseclick on another item.p  pWhen I remove the ItemsPanel WrapPanel it seems to work, but with a WrapPanel it goes back to this weird behavior.p  pI ruled out the Width binding if I remove that, the issue still occurs.p  pCan anybody tell me what is going on here, or how I can investigate this betterp  pEdit Ok... this is getting weirder. when I use my right mouse button to select one of the items, it works as normal. So something weird is happening on mouse left clickp  pedit I narrowed it down to an issue with SharedSizeGroup.

Without it, it works.p  pAnything I can do Maybe theres another nice reusable solution to align my form labels instead of shared size groupsp

Negative 1 pWeve developed a web application that shows quite a bit of data in a somewhat fancy interface with a table. I cant show the page, but it has quite a big table, inside a fixed positioned element, with some images mostly icons smaller than 2KB, PNGs with alpha transparency, and no more than 30 different images.p  pIts not that heavy, with less than 1000 elements in the page. It was developed mainly in Chrome, and works flawlessly in Chrome. And IE11, and IE10.p  pBut when it comes to IE9, emthisem happens img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3iP15.png altIE9 keeps repainting the page Yes, thats IE11, because it offers decent analyzing tools. Im using IE9 emulation, but that same unresponsiveness happens with IE10 in IE9 mode, and with native IE9, with high CPU usage  but steady memory usage.p  pIn a lighter way, it happens in IE8 too img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9el0X.png altenter image description here But the repainting takes much less time perhaps it repaints smaller parts of the page and the responsiveness isnt compromised.p  pAs you can see, no script is running, just some random garbage collection. In IE10, IE11 and Chrome theres no repaint involved.p  pIf I disable the images did this in IE10, dont know how to do that in IE11, IE9 doesnt keep repainting, embutem if I disable or hide all the images through the style sheets it keeps hogging the CPU. Disabling hardware acceleration makes things even worse, as expected.p  pWhat may cause this odd behaviour in IE9 and partially IE8p

Negative 1 pI have written a webscraper using Scrapy, grabbing some data to complementing my current information I have about a couple of companies. Before I print out the records I want to match them against my old records. Hence, I have created a dictionary with a company name as key and values are some related data. The problem I have is with the encoding, the Testofcompany.csv is encoded in UTF8 I encoded it and converted it to UTF8 in notepad. I keep getting the exceptions.UnicodeDecodeError utf8 codec cant decode byte 0xe4 in position 67 invalid continuation byte. Since the strongaccumulatorstrong contains UTF8 encoding and strongcheckstrong has a different encoding, I cannot match up the records.

Negative 1 pI am a beginner when it comes to Java, and I am starting slowly. I have made an Applet that allows users to input a certain sentence in to the text field, and the output tells the user how many words of a certain character amount there is.p  pI would like to add a few more things to the applet before I finish it, but I am not too sure how to do these things.p  pFirstly, I want the applet to be able to differentiate between words and punctuation. So if there is an exclamation mark at the end of a word, then it would include that in the length of a word. And also, I would like it to tell the user the mean word length within the applet window.p  pSecondly, I would like the information to be displayed in bar chart form. Meaning the x axis tells the user the word length, and the y axis, the words frequency. The reason for this is simply because i want the program to be neat and tidy.p  pAnd last of all, Im not too sure if it is possible, but i would like there to be an option for the user to load a file in to the applet, to which the applet performs a word count on the text within the file.p  pMy code so far is p  precode    package name package org.main   Imports import java.awt.BorderLayout import java.awt.Insets import java.awt.event.ActionEvent import java.awt.event.ActionListener import java.awt.event.KeyEvent import java.awt.event.KeyListener  import javax.swing.JApplet import javax.swing.JButton import javax.swing.JLabel import javax.swing.JPanel import javax.swing.JScrollPane import javax.swing.JTextArea import javax.swing.UIManager   public class Main extends JApplet implements ActionListener, KeyListener    private static final long serialVersionUID  1L    our panel to contain the content  private JPanel panel    buttons and Text areas  private JButton analyze, reset  private JTextArea input, output  private JLabel inputbox    makes the given text areas have scrollbars allowing for large inputs  private JScrollPane outputscrollpane, inputscrollpane        Constructor     public Main       create a new panel to hold our content, and set the text area indent and add a key lister   panel  new JPanel   UIManager.putTextArea.margin, new Insets10,10,10,10   this.addKeyListenerthis     add the panel to the applet, set it to be visible, and set its size   this.setContentPanepanel   this.setVisibletrue   this.setSize800, 600     create the two buttons and add then to the action listener      analyze  new JButtonAnalyze   analyze.addActionListenerthis       reset    new JButtonReset      reset.addActionListenerthis        create the input label      inputbox  new JLabelEnter a Sentence         create the input box, and set text wrap      input    new JTextArea10, 20      input.setLineWraptrue      input.setWrapStyleWordtrue        add the input box to a scroll  panel      inputscrollpane  new JScrollPaneinput        create the input box, and set text wrap and disable input      output   new JTextArea30, 60      output.setEditablefalse      output.setLineWraptrue      output.setWrapStyleWordtrue        add the output box to a scroll  panel   outputscrollpane  new JScrollPaneoutput     create the window layout controller and add it to the panel   BorderLayout layout  new BorderLayout   panel.setLayoutlayout     add the buttons and boxes to the panel   panel.addNorth, inputbox      panel.addCenter, inputscrollpane      panel.addEast, analyze      panel.addWest, reset      panel.addSouth, outputscrollpane          Handles button action events     public void actionPerformedActionEvent e      if the analyse button was pressed clear the output and analyse the text   if e.getSource  analyze     output.setTextnull    Analyze        if the reset button is press clear both text areas   if e.getSource  reset     output.setTextnull    input.setTextnull              private method that will count the word and their length     private void Analyze     Lets Begin      get the current text inside the input box   String string  input.getText     split the string where there is a space   String[] parts  string.split      create an array that will hold the number of words at a set length   int counter[]  new int[101]     loop through separate words and adding one to the place in the array    for String word  parts      counter[word.length]          loop through the counter array where wwe have more then 0, print out the result inside the output box   forint i  0 i lt counter.length i              ifcounter[i] gt 0                 output.appendThere are   counter[i]   words   i   letters long.  n                                Main method, creates an instant of this class  public static void mainString[] args    new Main     Override  public void keyPressedKeyEvent e     setting keyboard shortcuts    if e.getKeyCode  KeyEvent.VKV ampamp e.getModifiers  KeyEvent.CTRLMASK     input.paste       if e.getKeyCode  KeyEvent.VKC ampamp e.getModifiers  KeyEvent.CTRLMASK     input.copy       if e.getKeyCode  KeyEvent.VKX ampamp e.getModifiers  KeyEvent.CTRLMASK     input.cut        Override  public void keyReleasedKeyEvent e     TODO Autogenerated method stub      Override  public void keyTypedKeyEvent e     TODO Autogenerated method stub        codepre

Negative 1 pI have a large multitabbed HTML form where the user can enter lots of data through input typetext, selection, and checkboxes and the data is store in a mysql data base via php. With the checkboxes user are able to check multiple boxes per field. After the form is submitted i need to allow the user to reopen a specific form at a later time and edit that data. p  pI have so far been able to populate the text and selection fields by doing a Query on that specific form ID and using php variables to fill in the value of the text field or using if statements to select the correct option within my selection boxes. I am stuck though on the checkboxes. I am storing my checkbox data by imploding it and saving each field in a single column within my table i know this isnt best practice but i have no need to query the specif c of these checkboxes just to display all the data when needed Is the best way to go about this to just run through each check box from a specific field explode the data check each part of the array to see if it matches and then set checkedchecked if it does This seems like a massive amount of work because of the number of checkboxes i have.p  pJust wanted to see if I am on the right track before i spend to much more time on this. Thanksp  pPS Even though this is plane HTML and PHP I am open to any JS options as well. p

Negative 1 pI have a method in a nonmanaged class. This method returns an object of another class.

I think it would be fine to simply remove the tabs by creating an sql table like this, and at the program startup simply query something like thisp  precodeselect tabid from table where loggedinuser  0 codepre  pand then just loop through the result and remove all of themp  precodeforeachtabid in tabids      tabControl1.TabPages.RemoveByKeytabid  codepre  ptablep  precode  tabid     name      user1  user2  user3    tabPage1  project1  0      1      0        tabPage2  project2  1      0      1        tabPage3  project3  1      0      0       codepre  pHowever I somehow feel that this is not an elegant solution, especially because you have create a new column each time a new guy has to be added. Do you have any idea how to solve itp

Negative 1 pIm trying to create a dictionary with keys that are every 3 items of the list such as..a,b,c then b,c,d then c,d,e and the value of each key is the direct next letter, so the value for a,b,c would be d and the value for b,c,d would be e.

Negative 1 pUsing Javascript, I want to let users download or generate a spreadsheet that contains several parameter values theyve chosen, as well as formulas that perform calculations using those parameters. After they generatedownload the spreadsheet, users need to have the ability to change parameters and potentially customize the formulas. p  pIve seen that this can probably be done server side, but I think that requires learning yet another new language Im learning to code just for this project so I suspect thats not yet feasible for me in the near future.     p  pMy solution thus far has been to convert the spreadsheet into delimited format, then code it into an array of arrays so it can be downloaded as a .csv file when someone clicks on a link.  p  pUnfortunately, Ill need to make somewhat frequent changes to the formulas, and its a complicated spreadsheet with complicated and repetitive formulas so its tedious to find where to make changes to give a sense, the code for the array currently takes up 19 pages when copied into MS Word, 12pt TNR. p  pSo a few questionsp  ol lipIs there an easierbetter way to download or generate a spreadsheet with formulas and user inputpli lipIf the answer to 1 is no, is there a way to break up an array in the code and make it easier to findedit an individual cellvalue  pli lipAs an alternative, should I consider switching to Google spreadsheets Havent done this because a handful of users might not be able to access Google at work, but the majority can.

Negative 1 pI am experimenting with OLE database programming using Microsoft ATL and C with Visual Studio 2005.  I have created a sample Windows console program along with a simple database with a single table containing two columns, a 10 character ANSI numeric digits id and a signed 32 bit long count.  There are two rows in the table.  The database, table, and rows were created with SQL Server 2005 Server Management Studio Express.p  pI need to know the method used with ATL to update the data in a row that has been fetched.p  pI may be doing the fetch improperly which may be the problem.  During program execution I am seeing three ASSERTs which seem to involve a call to a method codeGetInterfacePtrcode that is being invoked by the codemyTable.Open code when executing the SQL queries for retrieving rows.  However the HRESULT value returned is SOK and the SQL query appears to be working properly.p  pThe codeHRESULTcode from the codemyTable.SetDatacode has a value of codeENOINTERFACEcode according to the debugger which is an error return and the selected row is not being updated however I do not know what that means nor what changes are needed to update the row.p  pThe Table1.h include file is generated by a wizard in Visual Studio 2005 however the class is derived from a CCommand type of template.p  precodeclass CTable1  public CCommandltCAccessorltCTable1Accessorgt gt codepre  pThe main program source isp  precodeinclude stdafx.h include ltstringgt include ltiostreamgt   the VS 2005 generated include file for the table. include Table1.h  int tmainint argc, TCHAR argv[]      HRESULT hrResult  OleInitializeNULL      switch hrResult              case SOK             break         default             stdcout ltlt Ole Initialization Failed  ltlt hrResult ltlt stdendl             return FALSE           CTable1  myTable      HRESULT  hr  myTable.OpenAll       stdstring mstrQueryselect  from Table1     hrResult  myTable.OpenmyTable.msession, mstrQuery.cstr     if hrResult  SOK          int nItem  0         while myTable.MoveNext  SOK                      if nItem lt 25                              char szValueChar[40]                 for int i  0 i lt 40 i szValueChar[i]  charmyTable.mIdNumber[i]                 stdstring sTemp szValueChar                 stdcout ltlt nItem ltlt   gt  ltlt sTemp ltlt    ltlt myTable.mCount ltlt stdendl                 nItem                            else          stdcout ltlt assessor open failed  ltlt hrResult ltlt   ltlt mstrQuery ltlt  ltlt stdendl            Update a specific row in the table by incrementing its count.     mstrQuery  select  from Table1 where IdNumber0000000001     hrResult  myTable.OpenmyTable.msession, mstrQuery.cstr     if hrResult  SOK          hrResult  myTable.MoveNext         char szValueChar[40]         for int i  0 i lt 40 i szValueChar[i]  charmyTable.mIdNumber[i]         stdstring sTemp szValueChar         stdcout ltlt   selected item gt  ltlt sTemp ltlt    ltlt myTable.mCount ltlt stdendl         myTable.mCount               ltltltltlt   Following SetData returns HRESULT of ENOINTERFACE         hrResult  myTable.SetData          if hrResult  SOK stdcout ltlt  update error.  hrResult   ltlt hrResult ltlt stdendl           stdcout ltlt stdendl ltlt  after update ltlt stdendl      mstrQuery  select  from Table1     hrResult  myTable.OpenmyTable.msession, mstrQuery.cstr     if hrResult  SOK          int nItem0         while myTable.MoveNext  SOK                      if nItem lt 25                              char szValueChar[40]                 for int i  0 i lt 40 i szValueChar[i]  charmyTable.mIdNumber[i]                 stdstring sTemp szValueChar                 stdcout ltlt nItem ltlt   gt  ltlt sTemp ltlt    ltlt myTable.mCount ltlt stdendl                 nItem                            else          stdcout ltlt assessor open failed  ltlt hrResult ltlt   ltlt mstrQuery ltlt  ltlt stdendl           myTable.CloseAll       OleUninitialize      return 0  codepre  pThe output of the console window looks like the followingp  precode0  gt 0000000001  2 1  gt 0000000002  3   selected item gt 0000000001  2  update error.  hrResult  2147467262   after update 0  gt 0000000001  2 1  gt 0000000002  3 codepre  pstrongEdit 1  Table1.h wizard generated with suggested changestrongp  precode Table1.h  Declaration of the CTable1  pragma once   code generated on Friday, April 25, 2014, 1025 PM  class CTable1Accessor  public     TCHAR mIdNumber[11]     LONG mCount       The following wizardgenerated data members contain status      values for the corresponding fields in the column map.

Negative 1 pI have a table of information .csvfile that I take each row of and convert into instances of a Java class. One of the columns in the table currently not filled in should contain scripts of some kind to modify another type of object.p  pI need the script to be able to call a selection of methods with parameters some have return types, optionally only if a condition is true. Calling a method several times with different receivers is also essential like with a forloop. The more I think about it, the more it looks like a separate programming language.p  pAt first I was going to create a simple interpreter, but then I thought of more and more features that I would need and it quickly became a too large project for me. I hope I explained my problem well enough. Can anyone point me in the direction of something that I can use to accomplish my goal The only thing I can think of would be a library of some kind, but other solutions are more than welcome.p
Negative 1 pTrying to understand the peculiarities of the keys. The documentation says that KEY  INDEX, and PRIMARY KEY  a different type of key. This is OK.  But there is the code p  precodedb  mysqliconnect localhost, root,  mysqliquery db, CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS publications  mysqliquery db, USE publications   try to create a field with the usual nonunique index that is not a primary key  mysqliquery db, CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS classics1 author INT KEY   output the indexes on the table  res  mysqliquery db, SHOW INDEX IN classics1  codepre  pWhy the author field contains a strongprimary keystrong I did not write something in the request the apparent creation of a primary key like this p  precoderes  mysqliquery db, CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS classics1 author INT PRIMARY KEY  codepre  pBy the way, if you add a row to the query p  precodemysqliquery db, ALTER TABLE classics1 ADD KEY author  codepre  p... then add a normal index. Why in the CREATE TABLE  KEY becomes PRIMARY KEYp
Negative 1 pIf i create objects in the heap and i dont delete, when i close aplication that memory is blocked for other aplications or simply it is free. In general its the same for c, java and so and for all S.Op  pi have knowledge about garbage collector, and delete from C, the only question is if i dont free the memory i use in the heap if that memory is stuck until reset the device for others aplications or not. It can be a silly question but really i dont read a clear response.p  pThank youp  pEdit In that post it seems to be that all allocated memory heap is released by each s.o independent of languajes.o. Is it correctp

Negative 1 pI am trying to find communities within my network using the R implementation of walktrap. My network consists of about 300 nodes, and is densely connected.

Negative 1 pHow can I compose a query to find records by the ids Im passing Currently I query them with this command codeModel.whereid [1,2,3]code. Everything works fine, but  this is not the behavior I want. The case is that if there is no record with id3 it will return results for id1 or 2 and I need to return the results only when all ids are found or return nothing.p
Negative 1 pI have an activity, in it theres a public void that executes a lot of code and updates some textviews with some information about the process as it goes. I want to be able to pause the code for about a second every time a textview is updated and have the update show up on the GUI. The desired result is a smooth series of changes rather than everything happening all at once. p  pI read that one way to do this is to use a handler with a delay but is that the best way when I have to do it several times requiring a lot of stacking them together p  pI also have a separate async task running, and I want it to continue running even while the rest of the code is paused.p  pWhat is the best way to achieve the desired resultp
Negative 1 pI have a function called codeconnectToMongocode that connects to a locallyrunning mongodb database codemyappcode. I have another function which invokes codeconnectToMongocode. I would like to test this other function with mocha. However, I would like to make it so that, while testing, any calls to codeconnectToMongocode will automatically connect to my codemyapptestcode database instead of my normal one.p  pIdeally I think Id like to do something like this where codeconnectToMongoTestingDatabasecode connects to codemyapptestcodep  precodevar connectToMongo  require.connectToMongo,     connectToMongoTestingDatabase  require.connectToMongoTestingDatabase     registerUser  require.registerUser  testingLibrary.configureAlternateBehaviorconnectToMongo, connectToMongoTestingDatabase  itshould register a user, function done       registerUsername bob, password password1, function error, response          connectToMongoTestingDatabasefunction error, database              database.collectionusers.findOnename bob, function error, user                  expectuser.not.to.be.null                 done                              codepre  pI have been trying to make sense of the Sinon.JS library. I cant tell whether spies, stubs or mocks would fulfill this need, nor what the equivalent of codetestingLibrary.configureAlternateBehaviorcode would be.p  pI suppose I could also create some global variable called codeglobal.MYAPPTESTINGcode, set that to codetruecode before I start my tests, and in the implementation of codeconnectToMongocode I could connect to the codemyapptestcode database if codeglobal.MYAPPTESTINGcode is true. That seems bad though.p  pWhat is the best way to substitute the behavior of one function for another in JavaScript unit testingp

Negative 1 pWhat is the difference between using set and save in angularfire  Also, is there a difference in amount of data sent to the server in the following casep  pI could have a firebase objectp  precoderootScope.projectgroups pgsync.asObject codepre  pdefined at rootScape and can save changes to it from every controller, by simply calling p  precoderootScope.projectgroups.save codepre  pI could also save changes to the server using set and define the exact location of a childobjectp  precodefirebasepgref.childrootScope.prgrid  projects.setrootScope.prid, rootScope.projectgroups[rootScope.prgrid].projects[rootScope.prid] codepre  pIs assigning new data to the childobject using set cheaper on data transaction to the server than using save on the entire object Or will angularfire compare the object somehow with the object history and only push the last local changes to the serverp

Negative 1 pI am struggling with figuring out why my kendo validation isnt working...but first let me back up.p  pI have a mvc 5 web app with a page and a button. Click the button and a modal kendoWindow displays a partial view to capture two inputs from the user. I had what I consider the traditional MVC validation process.p  precode[ValidatortypeofMyModelValidator] public partial class MyModel  ...  codepre  pHowever it would post to the controller with an invalid model I was testing for invalid submission state then immediately throw an error as it couldnt quite deal with updating the modal partial view it just came from with the validation check required field message.p  pSo after research and reading I determined...perhaps incorrectly...that using the kendo validator was the only option for this scenario.p  pSo I set about implementing following Telerik docs.p  pIn the model I have 5 properties but I decorated just one figuring Ill get it hashed out on one before doing them all. So I commented out my MVC validator and added this in my modelp  precode[Required] [DisplayName  Financial Named] public virtual string FinancialInstitutionName  get set  codepre  pIn the cshtmlp  precode ....snip.....

Negative 1 pI am currently working on a project called Gradebook which will be implemented in Ruby on Rails. In one of the pages in Gradebook, it is required that the instructor will be able to add, remove, or update an assignment. p  pIm a beginner with Ruby on Rails, so I went through a couple tutorials and realized that I could simply define assignment as a resource in the routes file. The only issue I have with this approach is for each CRUD operation, there is a specific URL associated with it ex assignmentnew or assignmentidedit. However in my case, I want to be able to carry out multiple CRUD operations in a single view. p  pMy idea was to have a single controller action associated with my view. The view would contain multiple submit buttons that would be named Add, Remove, and Edit respectively. The value of each of these submit buttons would be passed to the single controller action, and code would be executed depending on which value was passed. For examplep  precodedef myviewname     So all assignments can be viewed in a table            assignments  Assignment.all              if params[commit]  Add         Save assignment to database      elsif params[commit]  Remove         Remove assignment from database     elsif params[commit]  Edit         Update assignment in database     end end codepre  pBut would this be the best way to implement the ability to perform multiple CRUD actions in a single viewp

Negative 1 pI love FontAwesome, but sometimes search for the right icon is such a pain i.e. there is no fahelp icon, but I have to remember that is faquestion no famagnifyingglass or faview, but fasearch, and so on.

Negative 1 pIm trying to get some C code going on an embedded board running FreeRTOS and using its TCPIP stack to POST a very simple file to an Apache server running on my desktop.p  pI can pull a file emfromem the Apache server emtoem my board just fine, so I know the Apache server is running. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKSF8W.png altenter image description herep  pI have attached a Wireshark screenshot of the HTTP POST packet that goes out from my embedded board. You can see the hex values of the exact message at the bottom. p  pI then send another TCP packet out with the twenty bytes of data. I have tried that and attaching those twenty bytes of data to the same packet the header is in. In both cases I get a couple of packets back from the desktop outlining the error. It tells me there a 404 error which I found on one site meansp  blockquote   pHTTP1.1 404 Not Foundp      pThe POST path of a command is incorrect.p blockquote  pThe index.html file on the Apache server is in my varwwwhtml directory.

Negative 1 pI have an android app which creates a connection to a USB device and have to receive data through a particular endpoint. I am handling the data transfer part in native code. The app is able to find the device, open connection and find the required endpoint.  The data reading part is in the native code, where an ioctl call is made inside a while loop. p  precodeint bytesTransferred  ioctlgfileDescriptor, USBDEVFSBULK, ampctrl codepre  pThis gfileDescriptor is the descriptor for the USB connection.p  pSecond parameter is to indicate that it is bulk transfer. p  pThe third parameter has the structure usbdevfsbulktransfer which has the endpoint address, bufferlength  16KB, data placeholder, timeout1000msecp  pI tried this using two USB devices.  First device works good. Data is being read successfully.p  pSecond device seems to give some problem. My app finds the device, connects to it, finds the required endpoint. But the ioctl call always returns 1. And I noted that the time interval between two successive ioctl calls is 0.99 sec on an average which is approximately equal to the timeout value I set. p  pSo I have three questions here.p  ol lipCan I conclude that timeout is the reason for ioctl returning 1  pli lipCan strerrorerrorno find what is exactly the problem  Because I read that ioctl returns 1 on error and sets the corresponding errorcode in systems errno variablepli lipWhat are the situations in which Timeout occurs in case of bulk transfer  pli ol

Negative 1 pI am working with a convex QCQP as the followingp  precodeMin eIe zIzn [some linear equalities and inequalities that contain variables w,z, and e] wgt0, z in [0,1]n codepre  pSo the problem has only one quadratic constraint, except the objective, and some variables are nonnegative. The matrices of both quadratic forms are identity matrices, thus are positive definite. p  pI can move the quadratic constraint to the objective but it must have the negative sign so the problem will be nonconvexp  precodemin eIezIz codepre  pThe size of the problem can be up to 10000 linear constraints, with 100 nonnegative variables and almost the same number of other variables.p  pThe problem can be rewritten as an MIQP as well, as zi can be binary, and zIzn can be removed. So far, I have been working with CPLEX via AIMMS for MIQP and it is very slow for this problem. Using the QCQP version of the problem with CPLEX, MINOS, SNOPT and CONOPT is hopeless as they either cannot find a solution, or the solution is not even close to an approximation that I know a priori.p  pNow I have three questionsp  ol lipDo you know any methodtechnique to get rid of the quadratic constraint as this form without going to MIQPpli lipIs there any good solver for this QCQP by good, I mean a solver that efficiently finds the global optimum in a resonable time.pli lipDo you think using SDP relaxation can be a solution to this problem I have never solved an SDP problem in reallity, so I do not know how efficient SDP version can be.

Negative 1 pI will try to keep this concise. Working on a Fortran90 subroutine that uses a GATHERV to get data from all the processors in an MPI Communicator onto the root processor in the communicator.p  pUsing regular Fortran allocatable memory, the code functions as expected and the correct values are received by the root process.p  pThe code base the subroutine resides in has a module utility to get shmem shared memory segments in C and convert them to a Fortran pointer array for use. Lets assume that functionality is working correctly due to unitintegration tests working correctly and MPI operations on other shared memory segments in other areas of the code working correctly.p  pIf I switch the receive buffer in the particular subroutine to be a shared memory segment, the root process receives some incorrect data from the other processors in the call.p  pI have verified that the displacement array is the same between the nonshmem amp shmem versions, and that the data populated into the send buffer is also the same between the nonshmem amp shmem versions. Also used SIZEOF function and the byte sizes of the nonshmem and shmem arrays seem to be exactly the same. The MPIGATHERV returns no error code for the operation on nonshmem or shmem segments.p  pThe code is compiled with Intel 12.1 and Intel MPI 4.1.p  pI have included a strippeddown snippet of the important part of the subroutine below with notes dotted through for the parts of the code that needed to be obscured.p  pAt this point I am at a loss as to why the behaviour would be different between the nonshmem amp shmem versions, especially since there are other MPI operations on 2D shmem segments in Fortran in other parts of the code base that function correctly, and the nonshmem version of this subroutine functions correctly.p  pI am hoping the communityatlarge might have an idea of what could be going wrong, or ideas of what to debug to figure the particular issue out.p  pThanksp  precode maxPoints and nItems are the same on every processor.

This is where a watchdoglike script would come in.  I could use Pythons codewatchdogcode and write a script that uses codeObservercode library to monitor the text files being generated, a hrefhttpbrunorocha.orgpythonwatchingadirectoryforfilechangeswithpython.html relnofollowlike in this examplea. I would trigger on stagnant text files to issue a nonzero exit for the python script and then augment the above bash script as followsp  precodeuntil [myserver o pythonMon] do   echo Server myserver crashed with exit code .  Respawning.. gtamp2   sleep 1 done codepre  pwhere codepythonMoncode is the python script monitoring whether or not the text files are updating properly.  Unfortunately, this approach requires three scripts the main polling script and two monitoring scripts its a bit of a kludge .  Im looking to optimizesimplify this approach.  Any recommendations  Ideally, Id have a single script at least a single monitoring script to keep the polling script running versus two.  Would there be a way to add file monitoring directly into the bash or perl code This is running on 64bit, CentOS 6.5  p

Negative 1 pmy MVC app has common ajax methods in web api and regular controller. Id like to authorize these calls based on which area view of my app the call is coming from. The problem I am facing is how to verify the origin of the ajax call. p  pI realize that this is not easily possible since ajax calls are easy to spoof, but since I have full control of how the view gets rendered full page source perhaps there is a way to embed antiforgery type tokens that could later be verified to a Url Referrer. p  pAuthentication is already handled and I can safely verify the identity of the call, the only problem is verifying which URL MVC route the call came from. More specifically, preventing the user from being able to spoof the origin of the ajax call. p  pI tried creating a custom authorization header and passing it between view render and ajax calls, and that works, but still easy to spoof since a user could sniff the headers from another part of the site and reuse those. In the end I am not sure how to safely verify that the header has not been spoofed. The only thing that comes to mind is encoding some info about the original context inside the token, and validating it somehow against incoming call context the one thats passing the token in ajax call. p  pI see that MVC has AntiForgery token capabilities, but I am not sure if that can solve my problem. If so Id like to know how it could be used to verify that codeapicommonupdatecode was called from codehomeindexcode vs codeusersetupcode both of these calls are valid. p  pAgain, id like a way to verify which page an ajax call is coming from, and user identity is not the issue. p  pstrongupdatestrongp  pas per Sarathy recommended I tried implementing antiforgery token. As far as I can tell this works by adding a hidden field with token on each page, and comparing it to a token set in a cookie.

Negative 1 pCloudflare now reuses several keepalive connections to proxy incoming connections which is good for resource usage, but makes it quite a pain to cleanly disconnect a worker from them. Before they did this you could simply remove a worker from the load balancer set and no new requests would go to that worker, while existing requests would continue to be processed. Now that they use keepalives they dont need to initiate new connections and so removing a worker from the load balancer queue no longer stops new requests coming in over those existing keepalive connections.p  pI could simply call codeconnection.destroycode on each connection after a given timeout, but that would potentially disrupt valid requests. I could also call that after each coderes.endcode call, but since requests share connections one request may kill the connection another request is using. The same applies with setting a low timeout such as codeconnection.setTimeout1000code.p  pIs there a good way to reject additional requests from a keepalive socket while allowing it to finish all current requests It would be nice to be able to simply notify cloudflare in some way that a socket should no longer be used for incoming requests, but Im not sure that is possible.p  pI feel like some sort of halfopen socket would do the trick, but executing on that seems a bit tricky.p

Negative 1 pI have a little problem with RTF In our company, we are using a software, where you can send reports to a printer. The report is a RTFfile, created by the software, which uses a RTFtemplate to create the file, and then sends it to the default printer.p  pIt will print just fine everything is formatted correctly, but if you want to print a report, which has a table in it, strongwhilestrong having a Word document open, the content from all the cells from one row will be shown in the first cell. It looks like, that it would write one text over the other. a hrefhttpimgur.comyVEp3MP relnofollowHeres a Picture of what the table content looks likeap  pBut this only happens the first time. When you print the same report again, all the cells are in their correct positions.p  pWord is set as the default application, to view RTFfiles.p  pThis problem only appears with the Office versions 2007 and 2010 in combination with Windows 7. With Office 2003 and Windows XP there is no such a problem. The software works properly. It seems like a problem, caused by Office 2007.p  pIs there a known issue since Office 2007, regarding tables in RTFfilesp  pGreetings, Spookyp
Negative 1 pI am working with the Mean Shift clustering algorithm, which is based on the kernel density estimate of a dataset. I would like to generate a large, high dimensional dataset and I thought the ScikitLearn function codemakeblobscode would be suitable. But when I try to generate a 1 million point, 8 dimensional dataset, I end up with almost every point being treated as a separate cluster. p  pI am generating the blobs with standard deviation 1, and then setting the bandwidth for the Mean Shift to the same value I think this makes sense, right. For two dimensional datasets this produced fine results, but for higher dimensions I think Im running into the curse of dimensionality in that the distance between points becomes too big for meaningful clustering. p  pDoes anyone have any tipstricks on how to get a good highdimensional dataset that is suitable for something like Mean Shift clustering or am I doing something wrong which is of course a good possibilityp

Negative 1 pI think this is a relatively basic operation in SQL, but Im having a hard time figuring it out.p  pI have two tables, a source table Im trying to SELECT my data from, and a reference table containing serial s and transaction s the source table also has these columns, and more. I want to do two different SELECTs, one where the serialtrans number pair exist in the source table and one where the serialtrans number do not exist. the combination of serial and trans number are the primary keys for both these tablesp  pIntially Im doing this with a join like thisp  precodeSELECT  FROM source s INNER JOIN reference r ON s.serial  r.serial AND s.trans  r.trans codepre  pI would think this should give me everything from the source table that has a serialtrans pair matching with one in the reference table. Im not positive this is correct, but it is returning a reasonable number of results and I think it looks good.p  pWhen I go to do the opposite, get everything from source where the serialtrans pair do not match up with one in reference, I encounter a problem. I tried the following queryp  precodeSELECT  FROM source s INNER JOIN reference r ON s.serial ltgt r.serial AND s.trans ltgt r.trans codepre  pWhen I run this the query goes on forever, it starts returning way more results than it should, more than are actually in the entire source table. It eventually ends with an OOM exception, I let it run for 20 min. For some persepctive the source table Im dealing with has about 13 million records, and reference table has about 105,000.p  pSo how do I get the results Im looking for If it is not already clear, the number of results from the first query  results from second query should equal the total number of records in my source table.p  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 1 pTo explain it in a sentence, I am asking if it is possible to use the ActiveAdmin gem to create admin pages specific to admin users, i.e. each admin user only gets to see models and associating models specific to him. If so, how would I implement this p  pTo further explain my situation, I have a model called Sponsorwho would essentially be the admin users, and they put up different offersanother model that belongs to Sponsor for users to redeem. So what I am trying to do is create an admin page where each sponsor gets his own admin credentials, and the admin page only shows the information that relates to this sponsor, i.e. the information regarding the offers this sponsor put up, and all relating models and its details. Is this possible to implement using the ActiveAdmin gem or any other gems for that matter p  pI would rather not implement this from scratch if there are gems out there that I could use.

Negative 1 pNow first of all, I am not asking how to add a gesture recognizer or how to create a button. What I want is to know that somebody touched the screen in any way, without interfering with the related screen element.p  pThe thing is that I have elements that the user can tap on amazing, isnt it. Then I have a view that is overlaid on top of everything window addSubview. This view shows up with some delay, and I want the app to behave as if this view wasnt there until its show animation starts. Then, if the user taps any of the mentioned elements, which are not and cannot all be superviews to the overlaid view, the element should highlight and trigger as usual, while the view to be overlaid should cancel its show animation alpha 01 and remove itself from the hierarchy.p  pstrongtldrstrong How can I listen for any event for any object on the screen, without having to write explicit code to watch each of those objects  I just want to know that a gesture occured, not where, not how, not whatever And I dont want to mess with the view that is the receiver of the event. Is this even possiblep
Negative 1 pThe website I am working on needs to have dynamic labels, for example If the webpage is listing the authors of a particular book with more than one author it would look like this code Author 1 Nikola Tesla [Remove] Author 2 Elon Musk    [Remove] Author 3 Alan Turing  [Remove]codep  pnote that code[Remove]codein this case is a button that removes the particular person as a author.p  pMy problem is this, lets say I removed Elon Musk as an author the label for Turing should now change to reflect that would become codeAuthor 2code. p  pIve tried a couple different things using client side JavaScript as the solution needs to work without refreshing the page or any postbacks but I couldnt get close to a working solution myself, my logic seems to be off or limited by my lack of experiance in web dev.. I havent done much Web Dev at all so Im really learning as Im going. The solution would also need to work in the case of the user adding a new author to the book.p  pEdit The authors are NOT stored in a table but rather just listed using labels. This due to things out of my control cannot be changed.p  pEdit 2 Here is the code I believe is relevant let me know if anything else is needed.br codeltdiv IDdvAuthor  i.ToString   classformgroupgtltdiv classcolsm4 controllabelgtcodep  pAn added twist is that that is on the server side and it replaces a placeholder when the author is added this means when an author is added that page does refresh  this is fine, but removing should not require the same. Even more fun is that were not using JQueryp  pThe codei.ToStringcode is just an integer that is added so that the authors ID is numbered, ex codedvAuthor0code and so on. p  pEdit 3 Reply to Basicp  pOkay that clears things up a bit. The codedivcode for the authors label is coming from the server i.e. each time an author is added the page refreshes and the client now has the newly added author presented to them. So I guess my question is, how would I loop through the divs on the client, or even better could I loop through each authors codedivcode and just grab their IDs if I dont know exactly how many authors are on the page Would it be something like this codewhilehasNextAuthor add author ID to arraycode Sorry for all the questions, Im really new to Web Dev stuff, I am trying my best. p  pAlso, I dont need to worry about removing the authors from the webpage, I have a function that does that already both in the client side and on the server. The numbering is the only thing that needs to be done and it really is only cosmetic, the current numbering system works okay but does not dynamically change the numbering as the user removes authors, but rather waits until the user selects save and then reloads the page with correct numbering. p  pEdit 4 I think I have a way I can get this done, I just have one hang up... How can I get the number of authors on the webpage from the client side Is their a way in JavaScript where I can loop through and see how many codedivcodes are created for the webpage p

Negative 1 pI have a report codereport.jrxmlcode. All of the resources that the report uses are located in the same directory. Images, subreports and styles, etc.p  pThe directory might be codeclasspathpathtoreportcode.p  pAll resources are referenced in the report design by filename only  no directories are given.br e.g.br codeltimageExpressiongtlt[CDATA[logo.png]]gtltimageExpressiongtcodebr codelttemplategtlt[CDATA[style.jrtx]]gtlttemplategtcodep  pReports are compiled by using the maven plugin.p  pThe application is delivered as a single jar file. It is a webapp running on an embedded tomcat via codejava jar app.jarcode. It not classically deployed and not unpacked into any kind of known directory structure. All resources are loaded directly from the jar. It works fine with images referenced this way. It doesnt work at all for styles or subreports.br JasperReports expects me to implement the codeFileResolvercode to help it find resources it cannot resolve itself. Problem is that the return type is codefilecode which does not support loading files from archives...p  pAnd this is where Im stuck. Why can the Jasper engine find images this ways but not other resourcesbr What can I do now Any ideasp

Negative 1 pIm using Solr 5.x, standard highlighter, and im getting snippets which matches even one of the search terms only, even if i indicate q.opAND.  I need ONLY the fields and snippets that matches ALL the terms unless i say q.opOR or just omit it, i.e. the fieldsnippet must satisfy the query. Solr does return the fieldsnippet that has all the terms, but also return many others.p  pIm using hl.fl, to get the only fields having the terms, and searching against the default field text containing full doc. Need to use  since i have multiple dynamic fields. Most fields are textgeneral type for search and HL, and some are string type for faceting.p  pIf its not possible for snippets to have all the terms, i MUST get only the fields that satisfy the query fully since the question is more talking about matching all the terms, but the search query can become arbitrarily complex, so the fieldssnippets should emmatchem the query.p  pAlso, next is to get snippets highlighted with proximity based searchterms. What should i douse for this The fields coming in highlighting in this scenario should also satisfy the proximity query unlike i get a field that contain any term, without regard to proximity constrains and other query terms etcp  pThanks for your help.p

Negative 1 pI have a simple UI screen for user to enter data in an EditText line and then enter a date in the second EditText line.  I have a ListenerEditText.java file that listens for back button presses.  Problem is when the user enters data on the first EditText line and then focus moves to the second EditText line, the code no longer catches the back button presses correctly because it fails to recognize that data was entered on the first EditText lineit appears to only check whether there is data on the second EditText line.  When the back button is pressed, I would like the code to recognize there is data on the first EditText line andor on the second EditText line and then launch a DialogFragment to confirm if the user will lose the data entered.  Currently, the code doesnt see the data on the first EditText line and if there is no data on the second EditText line, the user is incorrectly brought back to the previous screen.p  pActivity.javap  precodeimport static com.example.jdw.secondscreen.ListenerEditText.KeyImeChange  public class CardViewActivity extends AppCompatActivity      private ListenerEditText myListenerEditText    private ListenerEditText dListenerEditText      Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.cardviewinput          myListenerEditText  ListenerEditTextfindViewByIdR.id.CEditText         dListenerEditText  ListenerEditText findViewByIdR.id.DEditText          myListenerEditText.setKeyImeChangeListenernew KeyImeChange           Override         public boolean onKeyImeint keyCode, KeyEvent event           int stringToDo  myListenerEditText.getText.toString.trim.length              ifstringToDogt0                  FragmentManager fm  getSupportFragmentManager                 CreateSkycardFragment editNameDialog  new CreateSkycardFragment                 editNameDialog.showfm, skycarddialog                 return false                           if dstringToDo does not have data the EditText input line is blank              then just cancel the soft keyboard and go to the previous activity.             else                  InputMethodManager imm  InputMethodManager                    getSystemServiceContext.INPUTMETHODSERVICE                 imm.hideSoftInputFromWindowmyListenerEditText.getWindowToken, 0                 return false                                     dListenerEditText.setKeyImeChangeListenernew KeyImeChange           Override         public boolean onKeyImeint keyCode, KeyEvent event              int dstringToDo  dListenerEditText.getText.toString.trim.length              If the EditText input line has data stringToDo and the user presses the Back button,              then launch the DialogFragment to see if they really want to delete the data and              go back to the previous activity.             ifdstringToDogt0                  FragmentManager fm  getSupportFragmentManager                 CreateSkycardFragment editNameDialog  new CreateSkycardFragment                 editNameDialog.showfm, skycarddialog                 return false                           if dstringToDo does not have data the EditText input line is blank56              then just cancel the soft keyboard and go to the previous activity.             else                  InputMethodManager imm  InputMethodManager                         getSystemServiceContext.INPUTMETHODSERVICE                 imm.hideSoftInputFromWindowdListenerEditText.getWindowToken, 0                 return false                            codepre  p...p

Negative 1 pI am making a simple blog android app where users will be able to addview blogs.Now for blog addition,there is a simple textview where the users can add the blog contentblog text. That blog content is then transmitted to a php script via HttpPost, which then stores it in a MySQL database.p  pNow my problem is that users can copypaste text for the blog content into the textview.The source for this copypaste could be anywhere ranging from internet pages to textbooks. Also the text could be of any font,color etc.This is possibly leading to character encoding issues,cos whenever i try to copypaste text into blog body, the blog submission fails...otherwise it works fine.My MySQL database collation is UTF8.p  pMy question is How to convert text from any possible source with any encoding to utf8p

To clarify this, imagine I have stored a Person entity with the propertiesp  ul liFirst nameli liLast nameli ul  pThen I want to add a new property, lets say Age. The way Im doing this is by generating a new Person entity class with CodeDom with Age as an additional property.

So it doesnt solve my problem.p  pHere is my code p  precodeif File.ExistsLOCALSDFFILE      File.DeleteLOCALSDFFILE   SqlCeEngine engine  new SqlCeEngineLOCALCONNSTRING engine.CreateDatabase engine.Dispose  SqlCeConnection localCnx  null  try      localCnx  new SqlCeConnectionLOCALCONNSTRING     localCnx.Open      SqlCeCommand localCmd  localCnx.CreateCommand       Table tTypeConfig     localCmd.CommandText  CREATE TABLE tTypeConfig                                 TypeConfigID int IDENTITY1,1 NOT NULL,                                 TypeConfigName nvarchar50 NOT NULL,                                 TypeConfigIsVisible bit NOT NULL,                                 CONSTRAINT pkTypeConfigID PRIMARY KEY TypeConfigID                                      localCmd.ExecuteNonQuery       Table tTypeSystem     localCmd.CommandText  CREATE TABLE tTypeSystem                                 TypeSystemID int IDENTITY1,1 NOT NULL,                                 TypeSystemName nvarchar50 NOT NULL,                                 TypeSystemConfigID int NOT NULL,                                 TypeSystemIsVisible bit NOT NULL,                                 CONSTRAINT PKtTypeSystem PRIMARY KEY TypeSystemID,                                 CONSTRAINT FKtTypeSystemtTypeConfig FOREIGN KEY TypeSystemConfigID                                 REFERENCES tTypeConfigTypeConfigID                                      localCmd.ExecuteNonQuery      Listltstringgt TablesName  new Listltstringgt     TablesName.AddtTypeConfig     TablesName.AddtTypeSystem      using SqlConnection sourceCnx  new SqlConnectionSOURCECONNSTRING              try                      sourceCnx.Open              SqlCommand SourceCmd  sourceCnx.CreateCommand               Insert data from server Wibe DB to local Wibe DB.             for int i  0 i lt TablesName.Count i                              string table  TablesName[i]                  SourceCmd.CommandText  String.FormatSelect  FROM 0, table                  SqlDataReader SqlReader  SourceCmd.ExecuteReader                  DataTable SqlReaderDataTable  new DataTable                 SqlReaderDataTable.LoadSqlReader                  using SqlCeBulkCopy bulkCopy  new SqlCeBulkCopyLOCALCONNSTRING                                      bulkCopy.DestinationTableName  table                      try                                               Write from the source DB server to the destination local wibe                         bulkCopy.WriteToServerSqlReaderDataTable                                          catch Exception ex                                              MessageBox.Showex.ToString, An error occurred, MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Error                                          finally                                              SqlReader.Close                                                                MessageBox.ShowThe data has been successfully loaded into local storage., Process complete, MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Information                  catch Exception ex                      MessageBox.Showex.ToString, An error occurred, MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Error                  finally                      sourceCnx.Close                 catch Exception ex      MessageBox.Showex.ToString, An error occurred, MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Error  finally      localCnx.Close  codepre  pThis is the line which throws me the error mentioned above   codebulkCopy.WriteToServerSqlReaderDataTablecodep  pThe destination table, when the error occurs, is codetTypeSystemcode.p  pI hope I gave all the informations needed to be helped.p  pThanks,p  pHellcatp

Negative 1 pIm in the process of creating a sidescrolling action game where you play a wizard that can cast spells. The spells are Box2D bodies that start in the middle of your player who is also a Box2D body and go outward in the direction you clicked on the screen.p  pI have all the collision detection working to where the spells you cast dont collide with each other and they dont collide with you. This works moreorless flawlessly  except for one instance. The first spell I cast creates a collision with the player that causes a brief period of physical knockback. The spells path is not affected otherwise, and I dont notice a major change in the players position. The only reason I know there is knockback at all is because the camera I have following the player suddenly shakes in that instant and Ive gone through the contact listener to verify that these particular bodies are forming a contact. p  pThis is not the case for subsequent spells that are spawned from the same position, and it doesnt seem to be a problem that is related to the players move speed or the projectiles cast angle. It may have something to do with how Box2D initializes items, but I couldnt promise that.p  pDoes anyone know how I could fix thisp

The problem is that the user may press the key two times and by doing so, the ball would make a double jump. I would like to prevent the latter double jump.

Negative 1 pIm creating a game in Unity which takes input from the physical rotation of the device and turns it into a force applied to the main character a ball. Using Input.Acceleration it currently works just fine, and I added a zaxis offset so you can choose what is the default up for it, say 45 degrees from the table in front of you. The problem is, Input.acceleration gives values which repeat themselves, like sine curve between 0 flat on table and 1 90 degrees to the table, but the y and z axis both do this at different intervals like cossin sorta pattern. Im not quite sure how to explain this better.. but Ill list what they values for y and z are for each 90 degrees, I somehow need to convert them into a 04 value, or an angle in 360 degrees  just some sort of linear increasing value for the z rotation.p  p0 degrees flat on table  y  0, z  1p  p90 degrees facing towards you  y  1, z  0p  p180 degrees flat on table face down  y  0, z  1p  p270 degrees facing away from you  y  1, z  0p  pUpdate Using the equation Input.acceleration.y  2  Input.acceleration.z  1  90f it gives an angle between 0, and 360 at a full rotation of the device, but in between 0 and 90 for example, it gives a value of 120 degrees before going back down to 90 at the first quarter rotationp  pUpdate2 I found a website which shows how to use the gyroscope to give an angle for the device rotation instead of Input.Acceleration using this code Cp  precodevoid GetZRotation       Quaternion referenceRotation  Quaternion.identity     Quaternion deviceRotation  new Quaternion0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f  Input.gyro.attitude  new Quaternion0, 0, 1, 0     Quaternion eliminationOfXY  Quaternion.Inverse         Quaternion.FromToRotationreferenceRotation  Vector3.forward,                                deviceRotation  Vector3.forward              Quaternion rotationZ  eliminationOfXY  deviceRotation     float roll  rotationZ.eulerAngles.z      return roll  codepre  pI would be able to solve this just as easily if I knew how this worked, and how to get the Y value instead of Z I tested it and it gives a linear value between 0 and 360 tilting the phone left to right, but I need the angle forwardsbackwardsp  pa hrefhttpanswers.unity3d.comquestions434096lockrotationofgyroscopecontrolledcameratofo.html relnofollowhttpanswers.unity3d.comquestions434096lockrotationofgyroscopecontrolledcameratofo.htmlap

Negative 1 pI am building a QR code scanner with Swift and everything works in that regard.  The issue I have is that I am trying to make only a small area of the entire visible codeAVCaptureVideoPreviewLayercode be able to scan QR codes.  I have found out that in order to specify what area of the screen will be able to readcapture QR codes I would have to use a property of codeAVCaptureMetadataOutputcode called coderectOfInterestcode.  The trouble is when I assigned that to a CGRect, I couldnt scan anything.  After doing more research online I have found some suggesting that I would need to use a method called codemetadataOutputRectOfInterestForRectcode to convert a CGRect into a correct format that the property coderectOfInterestcode can actually use.  HOWEVER, the big issue I have run into now is that when I use this method codemetadataoutputRectOfInterestForRectcode I am getting an error that states codeCGAffineTransformInvert singular matrixcode.  Can anyone tell me why I am getting this error  I believe I am using this method properly according to the Apple developer documentation and I believe I need to use this according to all the information I have found online to accomplish my goal.

Negative 1 pI want to use the Windows Action Center Notifications in my desktop application without making it a Windows Store App, which I have successfully done, with my application, all DLLs are embedded as resources and not exposed outside the exe. I also obfuscate the code to make it so programs like jet brains dot peek cannot decompile for source code. The issue is that loading a dll works fine, but it fails with the message Unsupported type when the program launches. This is due to the obfuscation and encryption. Even if I run the exe through my obfuscator with all protections disabled, it still fails to run. So my question is, how do I load the Windows.winmd file as a DLL that is included in the project as an embedded resourceand changing the extension to a DLL does NOT work as it returns a different error with an HRESULT code Is it possible to do with DLLImport Should I just write a different DLL as an access layer to the Windows.winmd classes Reference for original embedding source project a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles528178LoadDLLFromEmbeddedResource relnofollowhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles528178LoadDLLFromEmbeddedResourceap

Negative 1 pIm trying to write a console app in C which reads a log file. The problem that im facing is that this log file is updated every 1 hour so for example, if I had 10 lines in the beginning and afterwards 12, in my second read attempt i will have to read only the 2 newly added lines. Can you suggest me a way to do this efficiently without the need to read all the lines again because the log file usually has 5000 linesp
Negative 1 pI have three UIViews that span the width of the screen and each take up a third of the screen vertically.  The center UIView contains a form that the user fills out.  I have several forms that I need to switch out of the center UIView.  Right now in the storyboard I have each of the UIViews sitting between the top and bottom UIViews and I hide the views depending on user selections.  Is there a better way of doing this  Maybe have just one center view and changing the content via XIBs  Thanks. p

Negative 1 pI am creating a 2D game and Ive hit a serious road block when trying to randomly spawn power ups. Basically what I am attempting to do is spawn the power ups off screen and then they move onto the screen at the same speed as my scrolling background Once one of the three power ups has been spawned another one wont spawn until 10 to 30 seconds has passed. I also understand that the shield power Up is the only one that I am trying to get spawning randomly at the moment. I have been researching for hours and writing code that I will post below. I have tried to do this all by myself so I apologize for the quality of the code, I am still a novice and learning. Any help or links to websites would be greatly appreciated as I have no idea where to proceed from here.

Negative 1 pI have implemented your classic collapsing toolbar with a recyclerview mapped as the stringappbarscrollingviewbehavior on a full screen fragment. This works great however when the user scrolls down the toolbarimage collapses and then clicks an item in the recyclerview this redirects them to another fragment using replaceFragment. Now when I click the back button the collapsing toolbar goes back to being fully visible but the recyclerview appears to remember where I left off and it looks very bad. Any idea how to start investigating why this is happeningp
