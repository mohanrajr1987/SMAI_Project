Positive 115 pWhat Im trying to do is to get todays weekday. From it I get the rest 6 weekdays, I put them into an array and then try to use this array to update 7 codeUILabelcodes. A short list of weekdays starting from today that is. My codeUILabelcodes are in a referencing outlet collection and I have set their tags from 0 to 6.p  pI have tried multiple different versions originally without any array of this and have managed to make this work on Playground, up to the point that I have the weekdays in the array but on the actual project, when I try to update the labels, it builds successfully but then crashes.p  pEdit Crash comes after successful build. Error in Thread 1 breakpoint 1.1. Stops at the row super.viewDidLoad apparently.p  pEdit2 made changes as suggested.

Negative 115 pOkay Im still learning the ropes with the Entity Framework and I came across one more small issue.p  pWhen I create my Entity Model from the SQL Server 2008 database it warns me about saving the login information in the connection string in the config file.

Is the PE32 flag anything to do with it showing up as 32bit as per abovep

Negative 115 pIn our application, we have a need for a user to impersonate a different user.  Think of it as a hierarchy  Bob is above Frank in a hierarchy.  Bob is logged in, and he needs to do things in the system for a short time as Frank.  So, we have given Bob a list of users that report to him, and an impersonate link.  He clicks on this link, and, behind the scenes, I log Bob out, and log in as Frank.  I also set a session variable that tells me that really Bob is they guy who is the user.  Also, Bob acting as Frank now has a nice little link at the top of every page that says Stop Impersonation.p  pIn addition, when Bob is impersonating Frank, Bob is restricted from doing some things, like changing Franks password.p  pThis was working great, until we encountered a situation where, if the session I think  getting confused here gets destroyed such as when I copy up new code and dlls to the live site, then when Bob clicks on Stop Impersonation he gets redirected to the default page, and is still logged in as Frank, but without the Impersonation session variable.  So, now Bob really is logged in as Frank, and can change Franks password among other things.p  pHow is it that a session variable Impersonation gets destroyed, but I guess the session is still hanging around, because it doesnt make the user log in againp  pThis is a somewhat serious bug for how our system works bug in our code, Im sure, not in .Net.  Does anyone have any suggestions for a solution for thisp  pWe are using ASP.Net c, aspnet membership services, .net 3.5, forms auth...not sure what else you need to know.p  pEDIT Updated information.  Looks like when something happens, for instance, when I recompile some dlls and copy them to the webserver, the session gets dumped.  Or, rather, the variables in the session get dumped.  The session id stays the same.  I do get to check for Session.IsNewSession and it returns true, even though the id is the same as it was before.  p  pJust like Utaal mentioned, Membership Services is separate from Session, so its forms auth token is still hanging around in the browser, but my session variable telling me that that isnt really the user who is controlling the browser isnt there anymore.p  pEDIT  Sky, here is what Im doing to authenticate a user.

Negative 115 pIve encountered an annoying problem in outputting a floating point number. When I format 11.545 with a precision of 2 decimal points on Windows it outputs 11.55, as I would expect. However, when I do the same on Linux the output is 11.54p  pI originally encountered the problem in Python, but further investigation showed that the difference is in the underlying C runtime library. The architecture is x86x64 in both cases. Running the following line of C produces the different results on Windows and Linux, same as it does in Python.p  precodeprintf.2f, 11.545 codepre  pTo shed more light on this I printed the number to 20 decimal places code.20fcodep  precodeWindows 11.54500000000000000000 Linux   11.54499999999999992895 codepre  pI know that 11.545 cannot be stored precisely as a binary number. So what appears to be happening is that Linux outputs the number its actually stored with the best possible precision, while Windows outputs the simplest decimal representation of it, ie. tries to guess what the user most likely meant.p  pMy question is emis there any reasonable way to emulate the Linux behaviour on Windowsemp  pWhile the Windows behaviour is certainly the intuitive one, in my case I actually need to compare the output of a Windows program with that of a Linux program and the Windows one is the only one I can change. By the way, I tried to look at the Windows source of codeprintfcode, but the actual function that does the floatstring conversion is codecfltcvtlcode and its source doesnt appear to be available.p  pstrongEDITstrong the plot thickens The theory about this being caused by an imprecise representation might be wrong, because strong0.125strong does have an exact binary representation and its still different when output with code.2f  0.125codep  precodeWindows 0.13 Linux   0.12 codepre  pHowever, coderound0.125, 2code returns 0.13 on both Windows and Linux.p

Negative 115 pIve made a couple of programs which I release as freeware on my webpage. One of these programs uses TSpinEdit for some number input. It works quite well, so I havent really had any reason to use anything else.p  pHowever, yesterday, a user told me he didnt like how small the buttons were. I cant really disagree, because, well, they are. Unfortunately, the only way to make the buttons bigger is to make the control bigger, and that really doesnt look nice. Instead, I decided to change the component a bit so the buttons were placed next to each other, instead of on top of each other.p  pNow, Delphi wont let me include this new component directly in the DFM, because its currently not installed  its just a file thats added to the project. Obviously, it would be nice to change this  not just because itll let me keep the controls in the DFM, but also because it lets me reuse the changed component more easily  so Ill have to make a package and add it to there. Thats fine, I can do that.p  pBut that brings me to my question How should I manage this packagep  pAre there any problems in adding any other components I make to the same package, or would it be better for me to make multiple packages and divide them into logical groupsp  pI use version control, of course, so propagating changes to component code between my desktop and my laptop isnt a problem  but will I need to rebuild the packages manually on each workstation every time I make a change, or is there a trick I should be usingp

Off late I am in a fix whether to forgo these offers or not.p  pI dont know the dynamics of an IT organization and thus on one hand I fear that my C experience will be nullified and on the positive side I am getting to work on a new technology stack which will only add to my skill set. p  pI am sure, most of you at some point of time have encountered such dilemmas and would have taken some decision. p  ul lipI want you to share your perspectives on such a scenario where a person is required to change hisher technology stack when changing hisher job.pli lipWhat are the merits and demerits in going with either of the choicespli lipAlso I know that C isnt going anywhere in the near future.

Negative 115 pHeres my problem, I have an input element in a form that is implementing jQuery.Autocomplete and jQuery.validate, all working normally except when I click an element in the autocomplete list to select it.  p  pWhat happens is validation occurs before the autocomplete sets its value.  Because validation occurs on onBlur, and you just clicked an item in the autocomplete list, blur fires and validation occurs a split second before the input is filled with its new value.p  pI wouldnt mind a doublevalidation if it was client side, but I happen to be executing an expensive remote ajax validation on this field, so Id really like to solve this the right way.p  pMy first thought is to proxy all validation onBlur events through a function that times out 10ms later, essentially flip flopping the event order.

Negative 115 pStylesheet languages like Sass and Less allow us to organize our stylesheets like real programming source code, in more modular and manageable ways than raw CSS ever could. Using these languages is still a young art, and Im curious to learn how other developers use them in practice.p  pOne of the neat features about the openness of the web is that we can learn from others by peeking at their HTML and CSS. However, these new stylesheet languages allow developers to keep their stylesheet source code private and only share the compiled CSS output. The standard compiler settings will often have the stylesheet source folder outside the public webroot.p  pIf you use a CSS preprocessor to develop a commercial closedsource website, would you consider the stylesheets source language Sass or Less equivalent to the CSS in terms of openness, or is it proprietary source codep  pOn the one hand, these languages only give us different syntax for writing stylesheets, so their function is the same as the CSS thats already publicly visible.p  pOn the other hand, they could be thought of as source code and considered proprietary, in the same way as the Ruby or PHP that drives the site is used to generate HTML.p  pLooking forward to your thoughts.p

Negative 115 pI am attempting to emulate a no longer existing mainframe report generator in an Access 2003 or Access 2010 environment. The data it generates must match exactly with paper reports from the early 70s. Unfortunately, the earliest years data were run on hardware that used IBM floating point representation instead of IEEE. With the help of Google, Ive found a library of VBA functions that will convert a float from decimal to the IEEE 754 32bit binary format. I had to modify the library to accept either 32bit or 64bit floats, so I have a modest working knowledge of floating point formats, however, Im having trouble making the conversion from IEEE to IBM binary format, as well as trouble multiplying and adding either the IBM or the IEEE numbers.p  pI havent turned up any other libraries for performing this conversion and arithmetic operations in VBA  is there an easier way to go about this, or an existing library that Im not finding Failing that, a clear and straightforward explanation of the relevant algorithmsp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 115 pMy company builds a web application for Real Estate Institutions  initially coded in classic ASP with an incremental migration to .NET.  Essentially, its a website with backend DB, mixed with custom windows servicesdlls.  Pretty standard for .NET apps.p  pIn my past companies, we had a traditional software design life cycle.  We built releases of our products, and when we released, ALL customers received the strongsamestrong code.  Product requirements were filtered through our engineering team, sent to QA for testing on local staging environments, then pushed to production.p  pThis company has multiple versions of our product for multiple customers.  Basically, customer A can be on release 1.5, customer B on 1.6, and customer C on 2.0.  We do this because the institutions that use our application have strict requirements on anything that changes that affects their users.  If a customer is happily fine with release 1.5, they stay there, even though release 2.0 has all the latest bells and whistles.  Customers actually push back on the upgrade because the new features actually HURT their user base by causing confusion.p  pSupporting this type of life cycle is fine when youre small, but as you grow to dozens or hundreds of customers, its a strain on our DEV, DBAs, QA, not to mention our support team.  Now were in a situation where we can only schedule 68 sites a week that can be updated as requirements come in.  This forces us to make other sites wait 24 months to get even minor updates on their sites.  Any production issue or bug that needs immediate attention screws things up even more  because a site already scheduled to receive an update needs to get deprioritized to make time.p  pSorry this is so long, but ANY help is appreciated.  The earlier we make some changes to get us on a better release schedule the better.  Thanksp
Negative 115 pIm facing a conundrum here.p  pOne of the applications that Ive developed is loading an incorrect implementation of the a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavaxxmlparsersDocumentBuilderFactory.html relnofollowDocumentBuilderFactorya class of JAXP. This behavior was later deduced to be resulting from another class in different application built by a different teamcompany. The said class had changed the preferred DocumentBuilderFactory class upon loading, by inclusion of a static block similar to the one belowp  precode  static        System.setPropertyjavax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory, a new factory    codepre  pIf one goes by the a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavaxxmlparsersDocumentBuilderFactory.htmlnewInstance2829 relnofollowJavadocs of the DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstancea method, it would be quite obvious that the above code was responsible for changing the parser implementation returned to all applications, when the newInstance method is invoked.p  pA patch was applied, which corrected this problem, but it leads me to ask this question  stronghow does one determine which class is performing the System.setProperty call at runtimestrongp  pWe had produced a custom build of OpenJDK with a modified System class that was responsible for nailing the culprit, for the very simple reason that we did not have access to all the sources for all the applications deployed on the server. But this was possible only due to the fact that the production environment was replicated in its entiriety. The question therefore, could also be interpreted as   stronghow does one determine which class is performing the System.setProperty call at runtime, in a production environmentstrongp
Negative 115 pmy situation I created an UIScrollView with an UIView inside which calls a Graph class which draws a nice graph on a context. Now I discovered that the phone wouldnt render the UIView if its width is larger than 8192 pixels. In fact, according to Apples docs, if I want it larger than 1024px, I should implement CATiledLayer.p  pBut after reading and googling a lot, I still find it difficult to understand the basics of CATiledLayer for this taskIm somehow lost between Quartz vs. Cocoa and layers and sublayers vs. views and subviews. p  pIdeally I would like to keep the Graph class untouched, just draw the context entirely, split it into tiles and scroll those. The scrollview should just scroll horizontal, no zooming or vertical scrolling required. Is that possible If so, how should I continue Perhaps someone could give me an outline, just some bulletpoints or pseudocode, how I should restructure the scrollview, uiview and the graph class to use tiling.p  pThank you very much in advance for any reply.p

Can anyone pinpoint the known issues with UriMatcher Im designing a Content Provider that relies on UriMatcher to match my Uris correctly as opposed to incorrectly I suppose. Are there workarounds to the known issues Or is there a better strategy for matching Uris p  pExamplep  pHere is the code setting my UriMatcherp  precodeprivate static final int MEMBERCOLLECTIONURI  1 private static final int MEMBERSINGLEURI  2 private static final int SUBMATERIALCOLLECTIONURI  3 private static final int SUBMATERIALSINGLEURI  4 private static final int JOBNAMECOLLECTIONURI  5 private static final int JOBNAMESINGLEURI  6 private static final int ALLMEMBERSURI  7 private static final int ALLSUBMATERIALURI  8  static          return the job and fab for anything matching the provided jobName          JobNamesjobName         uriMatcher.addURIJobMetaData.AUTHORITY, JobNames,                           JOBNAMESINGLEURI         return a collection of members          jobNamememberattributevalue         uriMatcher.addURIJobMetaData.AUTHORITY, member,                           MEMBERCOLLECTIONURI         return a single member          jobNamemembermemberNumber         uriMatcher.addURIJobMetaData.AUTHORITY, member,                           MEMBERSINGLEURI         return a collection of submaterial          jobNamesubmaterialattributevalue         uriMatcher.addURIJobMetaData.AUTHORITY, submaterial,                           SUBMATERIALCOLLECTIONURI         return a single piece of submaterial          jobNamesubmaterialGUID         GUID is the only way to uniquely identify a piece of submaterial             uriMatcher.addURIJobMetaData.AUTHORITY, submaterial,                           SUBMATERIALSINGLEURI         Return everything in the member and submaterial tables         that has the provided attribute that matches the provided value          jobNameattributevalue         not currently used         uriMatcher.addURIJobMetaData.AUTHORITY, JobNames,                           JOBNAMECOLLECTIONURI         return all members in a job         uriMatcher.addURIJobMetaData.AUTHORITY, members,                           ALLMEMBERSURI   codepre  pAdd another Urip  precodeprivate static final int MEMBERCOLLECTIONURI  1 private static final int MEMBERSINGLEURI  2 private static final int SUBMATERIALCOLLECTIONURI  3 private static final int SUBMATERIALSINGLEURI  4 private static final int JOBNAMECOLLECTIONURI  5 private static final int JOBNAMESINGLEURI  6 private static final int ALLMEMBERSURI  7 private static final int ALLSUBMATERIALURI  8 ADDITIONAL URI private static final int REVERSEURI  9  static          return the job and fab for anything matching the provided jobName          JobNamesjobName         uriMatcher.addURIJobMetaData.AUTHORITY, JobNames,                           JOBNAMESINGLEURI         return a collection of members          jobNamememberattributevalue         uriMatcher.addURIJobMetaData.AUTHORITY, member,                           MEMBERCOLLECTIONURI         return a single member          jobNamemembermemberNumber         uriMatcher.addURIJobMetaData.AUTHORITY, member,                           MEMBERSINGLEURI         return a collection of submaterial          jobNamesubmaterialattributevalue         uriMatcher.addURIJobMetaData.AUTHORITY, submaterial,                           SUBMATERIALCOLLECTIONURI         return a single piece of submaterial          jobNamesubmaterialGUID         GUID is the only way to uniquely identify a piece of submaterial             uriMatcher.addURIJobMetaData.AUTHORITY, submaterial,                           SUBMATERIALSINGLEURI         Return everything in the member and submaterial tables         that has the provided attribute that matches the provided value          jobNameattributevalue         not currently used         uriMatcher.addURIJobMetaData.AUTHORITY, JobNames,                           JOBNAMECOLLECTIONURI         return all members in a job         uriMatcher.addURIJobMetaData.AUTHORITY, members,                           ALLMEMBERSURI         ADDITIONAL URI         uriMatcher.addURIJobMetaData.AUTHORITY, reverse,                           REVERSEURI   codepre  pAnd the last Uri is not recognized using     uriMatcher.matchurip  pOn the previous question mentioned earlier it was recommended that I move the offending Uri to the top of the calls to UriMatcher.putString, int. That solved the previous problem and left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Trying the same solution with this code results in the current first Uri JOBNAMESINGLEURI going unrecognized. Im fairly sure that the issue isnt in my code Ive managed to create a working ContentProvider utilizing Uris and debug all of the problems with them prior to this issue, but rather is an issue with Uri matching in Android.p  pUPDATE p  precodepublic final static String AUTHORITY  dsndata.sds2mobile.jobprovider codepre  pSample Uribr     contentdsndata.sds2mobile.jobproviderSDS2MobileDemoreverseC1p
Negative 115 pI understand the general concepts for this, but I am very new to java graphics programming.p  pThe idea isbr 1. Get byte data from a song and store in a byte array.br 2. Take a small chunk of byte data, perform FFT, and get some sort of useful data different things you can do once FFT is performed.br 3. Feed that processed data to a graphics function that will somehow use it for whatever visualization is active.p  pIm having a hard time on figuring out how to do 2 and 3 in real time. I want the data processed, the song played, and the processed data influencing the graphics function currently drawing all at the same time. I understand how to do these things separately, but I cant quite figure out how to put it all together.p

Negative 115 pIve inherited a C app which has recently been deployed to Windows 7 workstations. Before this it has been running on many Windows XP workstations without experiencing the issue below.p  pThe section of code in question tries to move a directory, using a loop in a thread. On the Windows 7 machines an emIOExceptionem is caught. According to MSDN a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.io.directory.move.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.io.directory.move.aspxa emIOExceptionem can be caused by 3 conditions. I am wondering if the loop may be trying to move the directory more than once, which might cause the emdestination already existsem condition.p  pThe symptom is that the warning MessageBox is shown repeatedly, but the move will eventually succeed. From my interpretation of the code, this should only happen after 60 seconds 300  200ms, but it seems to occur almost instantly.p  pAs my experience with C is very small, and my experience with threads even smaller, Im at a loss here Im wondering if there is anything obviously wrong with the code in question.p  pThe relevant section of code is below.p  precode    public static string archiveBatchBatch myBatch, string from              string to            to  FileSystemManager.getArchivePathmyBatch, System.IO.Path.GetFileNamefrom          threadedMove tm  new threadedMovefrom ,to          Thread t  new Threadnew ThreadStarttm.run         t.Priority  ThreadPriority.Highest         t.Start          return to           private class threadedMove              string archivePath         string fromPath          public threadedMovestring from, string to                      archivePath  to             fromPath  from                   public void run                      int errorCounter  0              while true                              errorCounter                 if TryToMovefromPath, archivePath  break                  Thread.Sleep200                 if errorCounter gt 300                                      throw new ExceptionWarning could not archive file from fromPath to archivePath                                                  private static bool TryToMovestring source, string destination              try                      check if path is file or folder             if System.IO.File.Existssource                              it is a file                 if System.IO.File.Existsdestination                                      System.IO.File.Movesource, destination                                           else                              it is a directory                 if System.IO.Directory.Existsdestination                                      System.IO.Directory.Movesource, destination                                            return true                  catch IOException                      MessageBox.ShowWarning could not archive file from   source   to   destination, Error, MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Warning             return false               codepre
Negative 115 pthis is my situationp  pI got a list of objects. Each object has a property called Z integer. There will come a point during runtime I will want to rearrange such objects in my list depending on their Z property. The objects with lower Z go first in the list, and the ones with higher will go last.p  pI have thought of a couple things, like making a new List, then loop through each object in the original list as many times as the amount of objects such list has so if it has 10 objects, I would loop 100 times, and each iteration will check the Z values. When a cycle is done for every 10 iterations, I will remove the object with the lowest Z number in cycle and add it to the new List. And so on until the 100 iterations are done.p  pThat makes sense, but might be quite inefficient specially since I might have a bunch BUNCH of objects... Any better ideasp

Negative 115 pIm developing an internal web application for use on the helpdesk on which I work, designed to be run fullscreen, all the time, on large TVs around the room, displaying relevant data for the guys taking calls. Were using strongInternet Explorer 8 on Windows 7strong company security policy doesnt allow for any other browser and strongjQuery 1.6.2strong. All the scripts and data are stored on the LAN  nothings coming off the internet.p  pEssentially the application queries several XML files generated by server scripts to display current information such asp  ul listatistics for each call queue such as the number of calls waiting reloaded every 5 secondsli licurrent announcements displayed in a slideshow format using a hrefhttpjquery.malsup.comcycle relnofollowjQuery cyclea, reloaded when it gets to the end of the current list of announcementsli ul  pIn my testing in Firefox and Chrome etc, everything works beautifully. But in Internet Explorer, if the page is left open for more than 10 minutes or so at a time, the whole browser starts to freeze up and crash.p  pIve done a fair bit of research into javascriptjQuery memory leaks, and while Ive found a few interesting articles, most of them have to do with leaks that occur when creating or removing elements in jQuery  something Im not doing.p  pThe way Im essentially working isp  ol liLoad XML from scriptli liIterate through each of a set of elements eg, call queues, then assign relevant child elements to variables. li liUse those variables to put together a simple HTML string using an array, I read that building strings that way is more memory efficient than building up a string using concatenation eg codestring  string  blargcodeli liHTML is output straight into the waiting container codeltdivgtcode, replacing whatever was in it before.li ol  pThe whole thing looks something like p  precode.getdashboardqueues.asp, functiondata      var allQueues  new Array     data.findqueue.eachfunction          var thisQueue  new Array  array used to build HTML string for this queue          var callsWaiting  parseFloatthis.findwaiting.text         var activeCalls  parseFloatthis.findactive.text           etc...          thisQueue.pushltdiv classqitemgtcallsWaitingltdivgt         thisQueue.pushltdiv classqitemgtactiveCallsltdivgt           etc...          allQueues.pushthisQueue.join           callboard.htmlallQueues.join  codepre  pTheres a bit of extra processing in there which changes the html code outputted for that piece of data in certain circumstances eg to if there are too many calls waiting. Additionally, I do a little bit of processing after outputting the HTML  figuring out how many calls are waiting in total, the call abandon rate for the day etc  but thats all simple calculations.p  pIve been pretty careful to reset variables and arrays each time we loop through to make sure theyre not retaining data. Doesnt seem to have helped much.p  pI can post more actual code if need be didnt want to make this post too gigantic to start with. Can anyone see where I might be running in to any problems If anyone can suggest more efficient or better ways of doing what Im trying to do, that would be most welcome also.p  pCheers p

Negative 115 pIm working with shaders just now and Im observing some very strange behavior.

If you run this shader and set point size to something visible, you should see white square in middle of screen Im using codeglOrtho2d0,200,0,200code. codeDummyAttribcode is just some attrib  my shaders wont run if theres none. Also I need to actually use that attribute so normally I do something like codefloat c  dummyAttribcode.That is also first question I would like to ask why it is that way. p  pHowever this would be fine but when you change the line with comment coderetval...code to coderetVal  rgbcode and add that mentioned line to use attrib codefloat c  dummyAttribcode, strange things happen. First of all you wont see that square anymore, so I had to set up transform feedback to watch whats happening. p  pIve set the codedummyAttribcode to 5 in each element of field and rgb1. With current code the result of transform feedback is 8  exactly what youd expect. However changing it like above gives strange values like 250.128 and every time I modify the code somehow just reorder calls, this value changes. As soon as I return that codedummyAttribcode to calculation of coderetValcode everything is magically fixed. p  pThis is why I think theres some sort of shader corruption. Im using the same loading interface for shaders as I did in projects before and these were flawless, however they were using attributes in normal way, not just dummy for actually running shader. p  pThese 2 problems can have connecion. To sum up  shader wont run without any attribute and shader is corrupted if that attribute isnt used for setting varying that is used either in fragment shader or for transform feedback.p  pPS It came to my mind when I was writing this that it looks like every variable that isnt used for passing into next stage is opt out. This could opt out attribute as well and then this shader would be without attribute and wouldnt work properly. Could this be a driver fault I have Radeon 3870HD with current catalyst version 2010.1105.19.41785.p

Negative 115 pI have a ad layout program which builds pages NSView class Page and on each page places margins and gutters more NSViews and then ads NSView class Ad. The app auto places ads from a database source, looking for the proper space to fill on each page. The user then has the option to move the ads from say page 4 to page 2. They also have the option to manually flow the ads or have the app autoflow, the assumption being that the ad you just moved will end up in the 00 xy location and then the others will flow to any available space, being pushed to the next page if there is no space on the current one due to the ad you just moved. p  pWhat I was doing was getting all the pages themselves subviews of an NSView called masterpage and then looping through them to get all of their subviews into an array. Loop through that array, filtering for margins and gutters and if it is an ad remove it from the superview. My thought was to start with a clean page and replace all the ads. Problem is I keep getting this error p  precodeCollection ltNSCFArray 0x1078900gt was mutated while being enumerated. codepre  pIm using this code p  precodeloop through all the pages     forNSView thisPage in masterPageSubViews            get all the ads on this page         NSArray thisPageSubviews  [thisPage subviews]         forNSView thisPageSubview in thisPageSubviews               if [[thisPageSubview className] isEqualAd]                   [thisPageSubview removeFromSuperview]                            codepre  pI guess I am confused as to why I am getting this error.

Negative 115 pMay I request that I any responder consider only pure CC whatever that means STL is ok. Boost is not.p  pI am writing my own C memory pool class on a Linux system for allocating and deallocating C objects in shared memory. I need this for access to the same objects over multiple processes. I will control access to memory pool object manipulation using POSIX semaphores, but I had a basic allocationdeallocation question. My code will only work for objects of the same size being allocated from the same pool. For the moment, we can ignore issues related to growth and shrinking of the pool dynamically.p  pConsider that I have a shared memory segment defined for a total of MAXFOOOBJECTS Foo objects.

Negative 115 pThis is in a ASP.NET web application targeting .NET 3.5 and using an AJAX codeaspUpdatePanelcode.

The third section contains additional tables of information about the pages item.  And the headers and footers are...well...headers and footers.p  pThe second content section will have 2 subsections, a list of images and the currently selected image.  It will work like the standard list of thumbnails in a list where you click an item and the currently selected image will be updated to the clicked thumbnail.  The currently selected image subsection is wrapped by the AJAX codeasp.UpdatePanelcode and contains a title, properties table, and an image that all get updated when the selection changes.  p  pThe list can contain a large enough number of images so that when all are displayed, there would be lots of whitespace generated by pushing the selected image section bigger.  p  pThe currently selected image section will have a defined height inside the update panel that can change based on the size of the image the user wants to view small, medium, large.  p  pWhat I want is to have the list of images be sized to the height of the selected image section with a scrollbar for the overflow.p  pIve created a simple HTML page below that defines some simple content and codedivcodes, how do I get it to look like my desired layout above  Ive tried different things that I know of using floating and whatnot, but nothing seems to come out the way I want.  I would prefer not to have to specify widths or heights except for the explicit height of the selected image div and let things auto adjust to their contents if possible.p  pThanksp  precodelthtmlgt     ltheadgt         ltstyle typetextcssgt html, body      margin 0px     padding 0px   div      bordercolor black     borderstyle solid     borderwidth 1px      padding 5px     margin 5px   div.image      backgroundcolor red     color white     textalign center   pageheader      padding 10px     height 60px     backgroundcolor green     color white   pagefooter      padding 10px     height 20px     backgroundcolor green     color white   .section    firstsection    secondsection    secondsectionscrolllist      overflowy scroll     display inlinetable   ul.scrolllist      liststyletype none     margin 0px     padding 0px   li.scrolllistitem      bordercolor black     borderstyle solid     borderwidth 1px      textalign center     display table   secondsectioncontent      display inlinetable   thirdsection           ltstylegt     ltheadgt      ltbodygt         ltdiv idpageheadergtlth2gtMy Pagelth2gtltdivgt          ltdiv idfirstsection classsectiongt             lth1gtThe Item To Displaylth1gt             lttablegt                 lttrgt                     ltthgtProperty 1ltthgt                     lttdgtValuelttdgt                 lttrgt                 lttrgt                     ltthgtProperty 2ltthgt                     lttdgtValuelttdgt                 lttrgt             lttablegt          ltdivgt          ltdiv idsecondsection classsectiongt             ltdiv idsecondsectionscrolllistgt                 ltul classscrolllistgt                     ltli classscrolllistitemgt                         ltdiv classimage styleheight 120px width 160pxgtImage 1ltdivgtltbrgt                         Image 1 Description                     ltligt                     ltli classscrolllistitemgt                         ltdiv classimage styleheight 120px width 160pxgtImage 2ltdivgtltbrgt                         Image 2 Description                     ltligt                     ltli classscrolllistitemgt                         ltdiv classimage styleheight 120px width 160pxgtImage 3ltdivgtltbrgt                         Image 3 Description                     ltligt                     ltli classscrolllistitemgt                         ltdiv classimage styleheight 120px width 160pxgtImage 4ltdivgtltbrgt                         Image 4 Description                     ltligt                     ltli classscrolllistitemgt                         ltdiv classimage styleheight 120px width 160pxgtImage 5ltdivgtltbrgt                         Image 5 Description                     ltligt                     ltli classscrolllistitemgt                         ltdiv classimage styleheight 120px width 160pxgtImage 6ltdivgtltbrgt                         Image 6 Description                     ltligt                     ltli classscrolllistitemgt                         ltdiv classimage styleheight 120px width 160pxgtImage 7ltdivgtltbrgt                         Image 7 Description                     ltligt                     ltli classscrolllistitemgt                         ltdiv classimage styleheight 120px width 160pxgtImage 8ltdivgtltbrgt                         Image 8 Description                     ltligt                 ltulgt             ltdivgt              ltdiv idsecondsectioncontentgt                 lt This will be wrapped in an AJAX update panel gt                 ltdiv styleheight 800px backgroundcolor lightgraygt                     lth2gtSelected List Itemlth2gt                     lttablegt                         lttrgt                             ltthgtProperty 1ltthgt                             lttdgtValuelttdgt                         lttrgt                         lttrgt                             ltthgtProperty 2ltthgt                             lttdgtValuelttdgt                         lttrgt                     lttablegt                     ltdiv classimage styleheight480width640gtImage of Selected Itemltdivgt                 ltdivgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt          ltdiv idthirdsection classsectiongt             lttablegt                 lttrgt                     ltthgtFirstlttdgt                     ltthgtSecondlttdgt                     ltthgtThirdlttdgt                 lttrgt                 lttrgt                     lttdgt1lttdgt                     lttdgtAlttdgt                     lttdgt1Alttdgt                 lttrgt                 lttrgt                     lttdgt2lttdgt                     lttdgtBlttdgt                     lttdgt2Blttdgt                 lttrgt             lttablegt         ltdivgt          ltdiv idpagefootergtEnd of My Page...ltdivgt     ltbodygt  lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 115 pIm just not getting why this is happeningp  pSuccessfully create dialog and instantiate it when user clicks on an item.  Zero problems getting dialog to show when desired and to go away when back is pressed....p  pThe problem is    If the dialog is still displaying when the applicationactivity goes away pause, die, when it returns, the dialog is still presented but no variables which are context specific are presented.  Note  I do issue removeDialog for the dialog in the onPause.  Yet mystically when the app returns, its somehow cycled thru onPrepareDialog and loaded up with missing variables xml names show.p  pWhat I want is for the dialog to go away and let the user make a different choice from the main activity and then redisplay the dialog  if thats what they want.  Or said another way  I want dialog to always go away if the app goes away.p  pIve looked into persisting the data but there doesnt seem to be a right spot in the restore process to do that or Im just ignorant.  I cant figure out why onPrepareDialog is getting invoked during onResume....p

Negative 115 pI have many Windows Services written in C 4.0 that at various intervals connect to a database and do various complex tasks.  Some of these tasks only occur every X hour intervals per day.  However, the server support team would like to know if the Windows Service is actually running as there can be a big interval between tasks.  They would like essentially a heartbeat for each Windows Service.  Every 5 minutes the Windows Service would do something that could be monitored by Microsoft System Center Operation Manager SCOM.  Any solution must being easily monitored by SCOM as the server support team rely on it.p  pWhat is the best way to achieve this type of funcationality  I thought of using Performance Counters and have SCOM listen for those but not sure if that is that best use of perf counters.p  pUPDATE Totally forgot to include Currently each service writes to a database this action but SCOM is not very good at monitoring databases records and differentiating which service is doing what etc. p

Negative 115 pIm using an encryption technique on a user login form to avoid passing passwords in plain text.  I store a unique challenge value in a PHP session, include that same value within an HTML form hidden field, and then I use a JavaScriptbased SHA11 script to hash the password before submitting it.

Negative 115 pI am relatively new to WPF and would like to create a UserControl that contains three RadioBoxes in a StackPanel. Each of the radio buttons has an IsChecked property. I want to ease access to that selection by publishing an integer property that indicates the current selection, call it SelectedIndex.p  pSo when the first radio is checked, the SelectedIndex value of my user control shall be 0 when the second radio is checked, SelectedIndex shall be 1, and so on. This should probably work in either direction when the user clicks on the radio box, the SelectedIndex value shall change accordingly. And when the SelectedIndex value is changed by code or maybe even some data binding, the UI controls shall update accordingly.p  pHow can I do that with XAML code I have the following code nowp  precodepublic partial class CommandControl  UserControl      public static readonly DependencyProperty SelectedIndexProperty          DependencyProperty.RegisterSelectedIndex, typeofint, typeofCommandControl      public int SelectedIndex              get                      return int GetValueSelectedIndexProperty                  set                      SetValueSelectedIndexProperty, value                    public CommandControl              InitializeComponent       codepre  pAnd the XAML partp  precodeltUserControl xClassMyNamespace.CommandControl              xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation              xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml              xmlnsmchttpschemas.openxmlformats.orgmarkupcompatibility2006               xmlnsdhttpschemas.microsoft.comexpressionblend2008               mcIgnorabled               dDesignHeight65 dDesignWidth219              xNamemegt     ltStackPanel HorizontalAlignmentLeft NamestackPanel1 VerticalAlignmentCenter OrientationHorizontalgt         ltRadioButton ContentDisable NamedisableRadio VerticalAlignmentCenter IsCheckedTrue gt         ltRadioButton ContentEnable NameenableRadio VerticalAlignmentCenter Margin5,0,0,0 gt         ltRadioButton ContentConfigure NameconfigureRadio VerticalAlignmentCenter Margin5,0,0,0 gt     ltStackPanelgt ltUserControlgt codepre  pI know how to pass values like one of the RadioButtons Text for example from a property of my UserControl. But this time, I need to map an external int value to three internal bool values, each true when the number has a specific value. I guess that should be done directly in XAML, but I cannot figure out how to accomplish that.p  pOr would it be a better idea to write C code for that conversion I could possibly do that now, but Im still unsure about the special DependencyProperty code which, I imagine, may change its value without passing my setter.p

However if I check it through the myComputerAdvancedEnvironmentVariables the folder is in the path. p  pIf I restart the machine after the attempted install and then run the installer again it works no problem.  I feel like it must be the path not being updated properly at the time of install or something like that.  Is there a way to force an update after making an addition to the pathp  pThanks, Neilp

Negative 115 pIve got an API a specific GUI library that relies on codestdsharedptrcode a lot, i.e. they are often used as function parameters and stored within other objects. For example, container widgets, such as splitters and boxes will store their child widgets in codesharedptrcodes. Now I would like to map this API to Lua via luabind. In an ideal world, Luabind would create new objects in sharedptrs and allow me to pass those directly to functions taking sharedptr parameters. This seems to work for single classes, e.g.p  precodeluabindclassltButton, stdsharedptrltButtongtgtButton codepre  pWhile I declare it like that, I can expose and use functions like codevoid foostdsharedptrltButtongt constampcode.p  pNow the luabind manual mentions that in order to use a hierarchy of classes, Id have to use the same sharedptr templateinstance for all classes in the hierarchy, e.g.p  precodeluabindclassltBaseWidget, stdsharedptrltBaseWidgetgtgtBaseWidget, luabindclassltButton, BaseWidget, stdsharedptrltBaseWidgetgtgtButton codepre  pNow I can no longer call codefoocode  it will fail to find the function from Lua. Can I somehow get luabind to still support passing buttons in codesharedptrcodes Also, I would like to know why luabind mandates that you use the same smart pointer for all classes in the hierarchy instead of them just being convertible to base class pointers.p

Negative 115 pim having a weird situation. im trying to implement a 10 years old pci camera device SDK to my camera management software. Manifacturer no longer in business and i have no chance to get official help. So here I am, looking for some help to my ugly problem.p  pSDK comes with codeVisual Studio 6.0code samples. One of the include files has a structure ending with a one byte array like belowp  precodetypedef struct AVData      ...       BYTE audioVideoData[1] AVDATA, PAVDATA codepre  pBut this single byte allocated byte array receives video frames and weird enough, it works fine with Visual Studio 6.0 version. If I try it with Visual Studio 200520082010, i start getting codeMemory Access Violationcode error messages which actully makes sense since it shouldnt be possible to allocate space to a fixed size array afterwards, no But same code runs fine with VS 6.0 Its probably caused by either compiler or c runtime differences but im not very experienced on this subject so its hard to tell the certain reason for me.p  pI tried changing the size to an expected maximum number of bytes like belowp  precodetypedef struct AVData      ...       BYTE audioVideoData[20000] AVDATA, PAVDATA codepre  pThis helped it get working but from time to time i get memory access violation problems when trying to destroy the decoder object of the library.p  pThere is something definitely wrong with this. I dont have the source codes of the SDK, only the DLL, Lib and Header files. My questions arep  p1 Is it really legal to allocate space to a fixed size array in Visual Studio 6.0 versionp  p2 Is there any possible way a compiler option etc. to make the same code work with newer VS versions  C runtimesp  p3 Since my workaround of editing the header file works up to a point but still having problems, do you know any better way to get around of this problemp

Negative 115 pI was trying to solve a hrefhttpwww.codechef.comproblemsD2 relnofollowthis practice problema, it is also quoted below.p  blockquote   pThe Chef is planning a buffet for the DirectiPlex inauguration party,   and everyone is invited. On their way in, each guest picks up a sheet   of paper containing a random number this number may be repeated. The   guests then sit down on a round table with their friends.        The Chef now decides that he would like to play a game. He asks you to pick a random person from your table and have them read their   number out loud.  Then, moving clockwise around the table, each person   will read out their number.  The goal is to find that set of numbers   which forms an increasing subsequence.  All people owning these   numbers will be eligible for a lucky draw One of the software   developers is very excited about this prospect, and wants to maximize   the number of people who are eligible for the lucky draw. So, he   decides to write a program that decides who should read their number   first so as to maximize the number of people that are eligible for the   lucky draw. Can you beat him to it        Input    The first line contains t, the number of test cases about 15. Then t test cases follow.

Im trying to format the output of a float to 3 integer values and a varying number of decimal values. Everything works except the integer values.p  pBy itself, the following code works to get me 3 integer values...p  precodenum  3 value  03.formatnum  returns 003 codepre  pAnd floats work...p  precodenum  3.12345 value  01.2f.formatnum  returns 3.12 codepre  pHowever, combining the two does not seem to work properly. The decimal precision works, but the integer precision does not...p  precodenum  3.12345 value  03.2f.formatnum  returns 3.12  instead of the expected 003.12 codepre  pThe same is true if I try any of the following formats...p  precodevalue  03.02f.formatnum  or  value  03.2f.formatnum  or  value  3.02f.formatnum  or  value  03.02f.formatnum  or  value  003.2f.formatnum  or  value  003.02f.formatnum  or  value  0gt3.2f.formatnum etc...  Which all return the same 3.12 instead of 003.12 codepre  pIf youre curious about what Im doing for the varying  dynamic decimal precision, the point is to keep all the values the same length, but different sets of values may not have the same precision. So I take the smaller of the longest precision value or 10 and force the others to match like this..p  precodefrom decimal import Decimal  dVals  [     absDecimalval1.astuple.exponent,  Get the number of decimal points     absDecimalval2.astuple.exponent,        absDecimalval3.astuple.exponent,        absDecimalval4.astuple.exponent,        ]      p  maxdVals   Get the largest value     p  minp, 10   Get the smaller of the largest value or 10  vals  [val1, val2, val3, val4]  for val in vals     value  0gt3.precf.formatval, prec  p      do whatever with value here... codepre  pAgain, this all works perfectly, except that the integer value never returns with 3 precision places when I combine it with float precision.

An inline definition does not provide an external definition for the function,   and does not forbid an external definition in another translation unit.p blockquote  pSo since theres no explicit codeexterncode here, these should be two independent inline functions with no interaction with each other.  No explicit codestaticcode is required.p  pUsing an explicit static fixes the problem for C, but doesnt work for C inline member functions, as the codestaticcode keyword has a completely different meaning in that case.p

Negative 115 pIm working on a mvc application over .Net, an extended part of it contains a function that post things to different social networking platforms such as Facebook, twitter etc. in a nutshell what it does is it actually automatically posts over different network after an specified interval and on specified timings.

Negative 115 pI am trying to fix a bunch of leaks that my codeUIWebViewcode is causing and cannot find their origin nor a workaround.

I reuse the same web view, same controller, same everything.p  pInstruments shows a very strange pattern in which all leaked objects are Generalblocks of various sizes and emnoneem of them has any information attached to it no responsible library, no responsible frame, etc. Each time codeloadHTMLStringcode is executed, new leaks are added.p  pIt seems that there are several threads in S.O. about codeUIWebViewcode leaking memory. I have tried all suggestions I found e.g., setting the codeNSURLCachecode to zero, or resetting it I tried releasing the existing UIWebView and allocate a fresh one each time I have new data, etc. but nothing has helped.p  pMy investigations up to now lead to one clear outcome it seems that the leaks are only present if the HTML I load into the view contains some Javascript. If you notice the codehtmlcode string above, it is made up of several components one is code[self scripts]code which is a function that simply returnsp  precodereturn ltscript typetextjavascript srcjquery1.4.4.min.jsgtltscriptgt         ltscript typetextjavascript srcjmy.jsgtltscriptgt codepre  pIf I remove this, no leaks are there.

They even appear if I simply include the jquery file or any other js file, as to thisp  precodereturn ltscript typetextjavascript srcjquery1.4.4.min.jsgtltscriptgt codepre  pSo, the question has anyone an idea about what is happening here Clearly including a Javascript file into my HTML is making the codeUIWebViewcode leak memory.p  pThe fact that leaks appear both when I reuse the same codeUIWebViewcode object or when I instantiate a new one each time I have content, leads me to think that there must be something in the way javascript files are handled by codeloadHTMLStringcode which leads to the leaks.p  pDoes anyone know how this could be fixedp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combG4yD.png altenter image description herep

Negative 115 pive been trying to create a good solid framework to build an enterprise app in the html space converting a silverlight app.p  pI love the thought of the MVVM pattern and that makes me feel a little more at home in the javascript world.

Within this directory, I have created a subfolder called subsite. So the file address to this is publichtmlsubsite. To access my main site, I go to strongemwww.example.comemstrong. I also have an addon domain that points to my subsite directory, which is strongemwww.subsite.comemstrong.p  pemMy urls are not behaving correctly.em When I go to strongemwww.subsite.comemstrong, it points to the appropriate subdirectory within my main sites root folder for the homepage only. However, once I start navigating to other pages with my subsite, the url changes back to strongemwww.example.comsubsiteabout.phpemstrong for instance. I would like to mask all urls for visitors so when a user goes to a page on my subsite, the page url would be strongemwww.subsite.comabout.phpemstrong.p  pWhen a user navigates to the site in this way strongemwww.example.comsubsite...emstrong it will redirect them to strongemwww.subsite.comemstrong with the appropriate address. If pages could redirect as well, that would be great Ex. www.example.comsubsiteabout.php redirects to www.subsite.comabout.php.p  pAlso, Im having similar problems with my subdomains. strongemcustomers.example.comemstrong rewrites to strongemwww.example.comcustomers...emstrong when I navigate to inner pages. I think this is a similar problem to my main site stuff happening above.p  pThanks for any help If you have a good tutorial that answers this, point me there.

Negative 115 pThanks for taking a lookp  pIm building my first on my own app after reading the Depot book and the rails tutorial and working though both. Im finding it difficult to get my associations worked out since theres so many of them in my current practice project. Heres the overview, its basically a simple NFL pickem appp  pA User logs in devise and sees a list of Games for this week.    lets say NFL games for example.br A User can make their Picks for    those games with that first screen mentioned and submit them for the    week.br A Game has 2 teams associated with it.br A Game has a    result torn on having a Results model or just using a result    column in games table here.  A Week has several Games in it which    are picked. p  pAfter picks are made they are allowed to see everyone    elses picks also but thats not really relevant here.p  pSo as you can see above there are several relationships that I need to specify and Im having a really difficult time working them all out. Also I found myself wanting to make scaffolds for each I know right but I dont think thats the right answer here.p  pAlso, once worked out is there a good order to take with them Like in this case I figure its a good idea to start with the Teams so I can add Weeks and Games to each of those weeks. But Im just really lost and overwhelmed I guess. Any tips on how to start tackling this problem Thanks so much for the help allp  pplease let me know if you want to see code, but I figure this is more of a process  fundamental question than a give me a solution to my specific problem question.

Negative 115 pI have a pair of MasterDetail Datagridviews in WinForms displaying information from the following class designp  precodepublic class Roads     private ListltCrossStreetsgt crossStreets  new ListltCrossStreetsgt    public string RoadName  get set     public ListltCrossStreetgt CrossStreets  get  return crossStreets            public class CrossStreet     public string CrossStreetName  get set  codepre  pMy implementation allows me to insert, update, and delete records and the magic of BindingSource seems to take care of keeping my data relationships in sync behind the scenes. The one difficulty I am having is when the user clicks on a record in the details view, leaves it selected, and then clicks on a record in the master view that is not the parent record. At that point, the program throws a System.IndexOutOfRangeException because it seems as though it is trying to apply the current index of the child record to the new parent. p  pI assume there is something I can do in an event such as RowValidating to catch this but Im not sure what.

each getter method that represents a column that NULL is allowed, forces the user of these getter methods to take appropriate action when needing the values of these getters.p  pSo for examplep  precode At some point this object is created LogError logError  new LogError logError.setErrornew SystemError   Some point later, someone wants to retreive the error name from this object   and pull

FieldNullException then it potentially allows a user of the getter to perform an action on a null objectp  precode If getErrorName returns null, then this will throw NullPointerException return logError.getErrorName.substring0,10  codepre  pTo avoid this the user can obviously check if the returned value from the getter is null before performing anything else emand there is nothing wrong with thatem. The benefit of my way, is strongsimplystrong to say emhey, this field may contain null so take appropriate actionem.p  pAnd an Entity can have many fields, so attaching throws NullFieldException on the getters that allow null, will strongconvenientlystrong signal to the caller which exact fields may be null and thus take alternative action on them. Thus not having to try and remember which may be null or pulling up your entity to check for your NotNull annotations etc. p  pemWrite once and let it remind youem p  pI do not use these methods for validation and I dont see how it is business logic. It is completely to do with the characteristic of the underlying database field.p
Negative 115 pI was experimenting over the weekend with a simple Waveform OBJ importer I developed for school. While doing that I read about glDrawArrays and glDrawElements and how the latter outperforms the former by keeping vertices in buffer for easy access rather than redrawing them. I developed simple algorithms to sort my vertex, texture and normal arrays to use both. However, when using gDE, I cant associate the same vertex to a different normal andor texture since it uses the same index for all 3 buffers. Therefore, vertices that are drawn upon a different polygon keep the same texture they get in the first appearance on the OBJ. That can be solved by writing the same vertex ntimes as necessary in the buffer with the normaltexture values they need. However, this solution turns the final buffer result into the same buffers that would be used for gDA. So, my question is Is there still any performance advantage Or is there a different solution to this inconveniencep

Negative 115 pI read some of the answers here and get mindlocked.  I am new and dont work at this, just taught myself over the last 43 years.  I converted a piece of code from the hit counter I wrote the other day, and it simply counts the number of times an IP runs my denied access page.  The code checks to see if the IP is already in the database table unique.  If it is, it simply increments and updates.  If it isnt there, it inserts it with a value of 1.p  pAll was well, then I noticed no increment when testing.  So I isolated it and found that it wont recognize the table column value to update it, and it throws an exception when it tries to insert it as a new value because it is unique.p  pI have looked and looked and cannot seem to understand why it works fine in my hitcounter, but fails miserably herep  precodeIP  SERVER[REMOTEADDR] IP  pregreplace[09.],,IP dbtable  deniedcounter echo Enter deniedrecord.phpltbr gt IP  strreplace.,x,IP  function setdeniedcounterIP, dbhandle, dbtable     hits  null     ip  .IP.     try         echo SELECT  FROM dbtable WHERE ip  ip.ltbr gt         stmt  dbhandlegtquerySELECT  FROM dbtable WHERE ip  ip         rowcount  stmtgtrowCount         echo rowcount.

Negative 115 pI am running a Citrixdriven environment, and I have a vital piece of software that creates a PDF repository of all reports as they run. The problem I have is that the users printers must populate into the environment Not just the default printers ALL of them, and a number of the computers have Acrobat 9 or X on them. The software that creates the reports REQUIRES that the Rely On System Fonts is turned off, but some users have it turned on when it comes to the PDF printer on their computers. Sometimes, when user x goes to create a report, it will grab the printer from user ys session that may not have the option properly unset Then user xs irreplaceable report is lost. The application is a Dexterity application, and I dont have access to the source. Is there a way, in Citrix or in AD, to script this one option to be unset properly Any idea if there is a registry key or some kind of hook I can activate with a powershell script to fix this headache I appreciate any help.p

I dont understand why though.p  pIts pretty simple, click a button and read files in a directory, displaying them back.p  precode        ltStackPanel xNameContentPanel Margin12,0,12,0 Grid.Row1 gt         ltButton ContentShow files ClickButtonClick1gt          ltListBox xNamelbgt             ltListBox.ItemTemplategt                 ltDataTemplategt                     ltStackPanelgt                         ltTextBlock TextBinding Name gt                         ltImage xNameimg SourceBinding Path Width100 Height100gt                     ltStackPanelgt                 ltDataTemplategt             ltListBox.ItemTemplategt         ltListBoxgt          ltphoneLongListSelector HorizontalAlignmentLeft                                  xNamellsFiles                                  ItemTemplateStaticResource FilesDataTemplate                                 gt      ltStackPanelgt codepre  pand the LLS templatep  precodeltphonePhoneApplicationPage.Resourcesgt     ltDataTemplate xKeyFilesDataTemplategt         ltTextBlock TextBinding Namegt     ltDataTemplategt ltphonePhoneApplicationPage.Resourcesgt codepre  pthen the codebehindp  precode    private void ButtonClick1object sender, RoutedEventArgs e              GetPackageFiles           private async Task GetPackageFiles              Get the folder where the app is installed on the phone.         var installFolder  Package.Current.InstalledLocation         var imagesFolder   await installFolder.GetFolderAsyncImages          var fileList  await imagesFolder.GetFilesAsync          lb.ItemsSource  fileList          llsFiles.ItemsSource  fileList.ToList      codepre

Before I just accepted this however, I just thought it would be wise to get the second opinion of someone, thanksp  pEDIT I just remembered that stacks are LIFO last in first out structures... Which just made things more complicated for me. If the last one in is the first being removed first, by that logic the array would look like C,X would it not Since X was added to the stack last..p

Negative 115 pI am generating binary files for use in Unit Tests which simulate a network. Some of the data sent through the network is in Little Endian or Big Endian mode and Id like to simulate that data with stub and creating binary files.p  pSo, in other words, instead of using an active network for my unit tests, I would generate binary files that contain the equivelent data I would expect from the network sockets.p  pI am using Python 2.7 to generate the byte arrays and save them to files, but I am having trouble converting my float array to little endian mode.p  precodefrom array import array outputfile  openrCtempbin.dat, wb floatarray  arrayd, [1, 1.2, 0.34, 9.8, 0.13, 1.1, 0.88, 72] floatarray.byteswap This doesnt convert it to little endian floatarray.tofileoutputfile outputfile.close codepre  pSo I wondering if anyone knows off how how to manipulate the array such that when I do codefloatarray.tofilecode it will write the binary data in littlebig endian mode.p  pThis code gives the following outputp  precodeVal  8.6184E41 Val  0.0 Val  4.1897916E8 Val  4.172325E8 Val  1.9212016E29 Val  490.3153 Val  1.5834067E23 codepre  pWhich doesnt match the wanted codearrayd, [1, 1.2, 0.34, 9.8, 0.13, 1.1, 0.88, 72]codep  pWhen I comment out the codebyteswapcode method, I get the followingp  precodeVal  0.0 Val  1.875 Val  4.172325E8 Val  1.9 Val  1.9023206E17 Val  1.67 Val  1.5881868E23 codepre  pHowever, in the real networking mode, it works great.

Negative 115 pIm porting a project written for BlackBerry Java to Android. The project contains some xml parsing classes written against the codeorg.xmlpull.v1.XmlPullParsercode interface. the actual parser instance is injected in those classes from outside.p  pThis app parses xml files that are encoded in a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiIso885915 relnofollowISO885915a aka Latin 9. I cant use UTF8, unfortunately I need to stick to this encoding.p  pThe old BlackBerry project used a hrefhttpkxml.sourceforge.netkxml2 relnofollowkxml2a pull parser. Now in android I was trying to use the builtin parser that can be obtained like thisp  precodeXmlPullParser parser  Xml.newPullParser codepre  pAnd then I configure the char encodingp  precodeparser.setInputltinput streamgt, ISO885915 codepre  pThe problem is that this parser does not support this char encoding. This is the exception thrown p  precodeorg.xmlpull.v1.XmlPullParserException Error parsing document. positionline 1, column 1 caused by org.apache.harmony.xml.ExpatParserParseException At line 1, column 0 unknown encoding. codepre  pAnd its really odd because I know Android supports this encoding. The proof is this line runs with no exceptionsp  precodeString test   new Stringhi.getBytes, ISO885915 codepre  pHowever, if I configure the parser for a different encoding, like UTF8 or latin1, it works.p  pNext thing I tried is to use the old projects parser kxml2 in Android, but then I got new errorsp  precodeorg.xmlpull.v1.XmlPullParserException unexpected type positionENDDOCUMENT null91 in java.io.InputStreamReader43e97088 codepre  pEven if I could use it without issues, kxml2 hasnt received support in the last years last version released in 2006, so Id like to use Androids pull parser if possible, which is more robust and also would have better performance. p  pI can fool the default parser calling codeparser.setInputbais, ISO88591code, because this way it ignores the encoding in the XML declaration in the file, and it works because both charsets have the same number of characters and most of them are the same. But this way someone looking at the source code could think that it uses latin1 when actually it receives input in latin9 and hence produces strings in latin9.p  pIs there any reason for the default XML Pull Parser for not supporting ISO885915 Is there any alternative PULL parsing library with good char encoding supportp  pThanks in advance.p  hr  pUPDATE When I wrote the question I have tested the default parser in OS 2.2 and 2.3. However, reading the javadoc for codeXml.newPullParsercode I found thisp  blockquote   pemNote This is actually slower than the SAX parser, and its not fully implemented. If you need a fast, mostly implemented pull parser, use this. If you need a complete implementation, use KXML.em p blockquote  pAnd in fact, when testing the default parser in OS 4.x, I got the second exception. Looks like for OS 4 the builtin parser is actually kxmlp

Negative 115 pI am very new to vb.net and Im trying to do something that I can do easily in classic vb. I want to get the source html for a webpage from the URL.p  pIm using vb.net in Visual Studio Express for Windows 8.p  pIve read loads of stuff that talk about HttpWebRequest, but I cant get it to work properly.p  pI did at one point have it returning the html header, but I want to content of the page. Now, I cant even get it back to giving me the header. Ultimately, I want to process the html returned which Ill do to begin with the oldfashioned way and process the returned html as a string, but for now Id like to just get the page.p  pThe code Ive got isp  precodeDim URL As String  httpwww.crayola.com Dim request As System.Net.HttpWebRequest  System.Net.HttpWebRequest.CreateNew UriURL txtHTML.Text  request.GetRequestStreamAsync.ToString codepre  pCan anyone help me with an example to get me going pleasep
Negative 115 pI have purchased a VPS from Digital Ocean. I have console access, so no need to worry about the network not being configured at install time.p  pI have already tried using codeddcode to write a small installer image a hrefhttpmfsbsd.vx.skfilesimagesamd649 relnofollow titleFreeBSD install imagesimage found herea to codedevsdacode. Like sop  precodedd ifrootmfsbsd9.1RELEASEp2amd64.img ofdevsda codepre  pThis made the VPS crash, so I tried again, but first I ran codeumount f l code. This seemed to work dd wrote the image, but when I rebooted, to my surprise I was back in Ubuntu.p  pI also tried installing grub and grub2, but I could not access a boot menu for either via the console, even after setting the timeout and visibility options I think that grubgrub2 did not emreallyem install, and the VPS just boots directly into the OS.p  pDoes anyone have anything clever that I can try I can wipe and restore the VPS as many times as I want, so give me any and all ideas that come to mindp  pThanksp

Each object contains instructions to creating a codeBufferedImagecode  this is done to get around codeBufferedImagecode not being directly serializable itself.p  pThe class being serialised isp  precodepublic final class MapTile extends TransientImage      private static final long serialVersionUID  0     private transient BufferedImage f     transient BufferedImage b     int along     int down     boolean flip  false     int rot  0      public MapTileWorld w, int a, int d               f  w.getMapTiles         along  a         down  d         assignImage           public MapTileWorld w, int a, int d, int r, boolean fl               f  w.getMapTiles         along  a         down  d         rot  r         flip  fl         assignImage           public int getA              return along           public int getD              return down           Override     public void assignImage              if f  null                      f  World.mapTiles                  b  f.getSubimagealong, down, World.squareSize, World.squareSize         if rot  0                      b  SmallMap.rotateImageb, rot                  if flip                      b  SmallMap.flipImageb                  super.setImageb         f.flush         b.flush         f  null         b  null       codepre  pwhich extendsp  precodepublic abstract class TransientImage implements Serializable      private transient BufferedImage image      public BufferedImage getImage              return image           public void setImageBufferedImage i              image  i           public abstract void assignImage      private void readObjectObjectInputStream in throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException              in.defaultReadObject         assignImage       codepre  pThis will ultimately be part of a map  usually it is created randomly but certain areas must be the same each time, hence serialising them and reading the array back in.

Each time I run the program the contents of the two dimensional array codemapArraycode in write, codehomeTilescode in read is different.  Not only different from the one I thought I wrote, but also different each time the program is opened. p  pAs can be seen, Im printing out the codetoStringcode to codeSystem.outcode which reveals further oddities.  As its just a standard array, the codetoStringcode isnt 100 helpful but it seems to cycle between several distinct values.  However, even when the codetoStringgcode gives the same value, the contents of the array as displayed are not the same.p  pAn example of a codetoStringcode is codehometiles[[Lriseofthenecromancer.MapTile7681720acode  Looking at the documentation for codeArray.toStringcode a hrefhttpgrepcode.comfilerepository.grepcode.comjavarootjdkopenjdk6b14javautilArrays.javaArrays.toString28java.lang.Object5B5D29 relnofollowherea it seems to be badly formed, lacking a trailing ].  Im not sure if this is a clue to the issue or if its simply that the array is very large several thousand objects and its an issue of display space Im using NetBeans.p  pAny insight as to why this is changing would be appreciated.  My working assumption is that its serializing the array but not the contents.  But I have no idea a if thats the case and bif it is, what to do about it.p  pEDIT  Looking into this a bit further, it seems that instance variables arent being set immediately.  Printing them out directly after the call to codesetImagecode has them all at zero, printing them from the calling class has them where they should be.p

Im talking about setMaximimumMessageSize on this object a hrefhttpdownload.eclipse.orgjettystable9apidocsorgeclipsejettywebsocketapiSession.html relnofollowhttpdownload.eclipse.orgjettystable9apidocsorgeclipsejettywebsocketapiSession.htmlap  pInstead, what you have to do is set the max message size on the policy object acquired from the WebSocketServletFactory.p  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodepublic final class MyWebSocketServlet extends WebSocketServlet      private static final long MAXMESSAGESIZE  1000000      Override     public void configureWebSocketServletFactory factory              factory.getPolicy.setMaxMessageSizeMAXMESSAGESIZE         factory.setCreatornew MyWebSocketCreator       codepre  pThis will work as intended and your server will be able to handle large messages up to the maximum size you set.p

Negative 115 pRecently Ive bumped into next problem.  I use CoreAudio AudioUnit RemoteIO to playrecord sound stream in an iOS app. p  pSound stream which goes into audio unit is 2 channel LPCM, 16 bit, signed integer, interleaved I also configure an output recording stream which is basically the same but has only one channel and 2 bytes per packet and frame.p  pI have configured my input ASBD as follows I get no error when I set it and when I initialize unitp  precodeASBD.mFormatFlags  kLinearPCMFormatFlagIsSignedInteger  kLinearPCMFormatFlagIsPacked ASBD.mBytesPerPacket  4 ASBD.mFramesPerPacket  1 ASBD.mBytesPerFrame  4 ASBD.mChannelsPerFrame  2 ASBD.mBitsPerChannel  16 codepre  pIn my render callback function I get AudioBufferList with one buffer as I understand, because the audio stream is interleaved.p  pI have a sample stereo file for testing which is 100 stereo with 2 obvious channels. I translate it into stream which corresponds to ASBD and feed to audio unit.p  pWhen I play sample file I hear only left channel. p  pI would appreciate any ideas why this happens.

Obviously I cannot let the users of the webApp modify the code in codemodels.pycode, so there has to be another way.

Negative 115 pWe have an app on android and iOS that is currently getting tokens directly from GCMAPN and passing that to our servers. Our servers send messages directly to the GCMAPN notification servers. We want to migrate to Urban Airship without changing the clients at all. I can imagine this would be technically possible by having our servers forward the APNGCM token to Urban Airship on behalf of the client device since we get the token anyway. UA only needs the APNGCM token, so it shouldnt matter if the device is sending it to them or that our server is sending it, as long as they get the token. I assume their servers will send us back a second UA token, which is what we use from then on to send messages via UA. p  pSo instead of thisp  precodeDevice gt    UASDK gt       GetAPNToken      RegisterWithUA   RegisterWithOurServers     codepre  pCan we instead do thisp  precodeDevice gt   GetAPNToken   RegisterWithOurServers gt       RegisterWithUA codepre  pThe key difference being that only our servers are interacting with Urban Airship and the client doesnt care.p  pIs this possiblep

On my first attempt I included where Pass  P, but then realised that just excluded all the failures resulting in false information.p  pI THINK I need to find a way to make this query show only products where Attempts  1 with a subquery, then join that output with the results table and counting Pass  P, but I cant figure out the syntax of the join command. p  pIm not looking for code  Id much rather someone could just give me some advice.

Negative 115 pI have a class that extends JFrame. It loads 180 images into an array using the following codep  precodeImageIO.readgetClass.getClassLoader.getResourceAsStreamrenderconstructImageFilenamei codepre  pThe constructImageFilename function creates the filename for each file, located within a folder in the src called render. It works fine.p  pThe class then creates an ImagePanel with the first image in the array. It adds the ImagePanel, sets its size, and then shows up.p  pThe ImagePanel class is a class that extends JPanel.p  precodepublic class ImagePanel extends JPanel     private BufferedImage img This is the image that the ImagePanel contains.     public ImagePanel         super          public void setImageBufferedImage i imgi Mutator for the image.     public BufferedImage getImage return img Accessor for the image.     public void paintGraphics g          super.paintg Paint the normal JPanel stuff.

It simply shows the default gray of the JPanel. There are no runtime errors, and the image was clearly loaded, as calling getRGB on the BufferedImage returns values.p  pWhat could be causing the PNG not to displayp  pUPDATE I tried using a JLabel instead of my ImagePanel class. The JLabel seems to have the same problem. It displays when I use a JPEG, but displays nothing when I use a PNG.p

Negative 115 pIm working on a jquery application. The end user sends a request to the server, and the server creates a file with all the values, but the server only sends the x first values.p  pThe end user can click on a button to have the x next values, or he can click on another button to have all values.  To have all values, ive created an ajax request in a function name internGetAllValues, and in the callback function of the ajax request, i recursively call the same function internGetAllValues except if the user clicks on a stop button.p  pThen i display the number of values loaded. i can see the number of values incrementing fast at first , but then after a while it slows down. ive checked the server and it does not seem to be overwhelmed. What could be the problem p

Negative 115 pI am not sure if this is a good question as Im unsure if theres any agreement on the subject. However due to the lack of information in the internet Im compelled to ask anyways.p  pLets say Im making a system that is mainly objectoriented, with its corresponding UML diagrams usecase, class, colaboration, etc. However, none of the UML diagrams are helpful when dealing with the database, which should be relevant for the developing team so they can know what exists in the database and what does not.p  pThere are two ways to represent a database EntityRelationship and Relational its unknown to me if there are more, but those two are relevant within the relational database paradigm. ER deals with the representation of the BD in terms of business rules, and Relational deals with the actual, physical implementation. But none are UML standard unless Im missing something here.p  pWhich modeling should I use, and why Is ER relevant in terms of UML, or should I stick to relational Thank you beforehand.p

Negative 115 pI have a Smart card, that was delivered with a properitary, precompiled JNINDK library.p  pThe smart card works by having the end user app access a file in the root of the SD card.p  pThis works by having the end user app readwrite APDUs to a interface in the JNI library, the JNI library translates those APDUs to writes and reads to the file.p  pThe specification of how APDUs are readwritten to this file are properitary and not available to the customers of the card.p  pNow to the problem Since the new Android 4.4.2 SD card policy prevents writes to the SD card except for the app userspace folder, its not possible to write to the SD card root, and thus the function of the SD SmartCard is lost.p  pHowever, if you use a OPENDOCUMENT intent and a file picker in the end user app, you could have the end user select the relevant file in the root of SD card, and thus gain rw permission to this file through a file descriptor.p  pHowever, I wonder, is it possible to redirectoverride all outgoing file calls readwrites from a precompiled JNI library, to instead go through the file descriptor returned by the intentp  pEg if I could in some way override the raw file open method called by any libraries some proprietary .so files loaded by my app, to go through my app and then I dont open the file, instead I just pass the OPENDOCUMENT file descriptor directly, so the .so files are ReadingWriting from this file descriptor, that are actually returned by the OPENDOCUMENT intent, gaining access to the file in the root of the SD card that is used for APDU Communication with the smart card.p

Negative 115 pGIven a 2D plot in Mathematica, if you keep clicking the graph, a sequence of coordinates of that graph are shown. Id like to extract the x and y coordinates of ALL of these points, WITHOUT using the Get Coordinates tool which only extracts one coordinate at a time, which is both inaccurate and laborious. An additional constraint is that the equation of the plot is UNKNOWN I found a graph produced by Wolfram Alpha, the equation of which is unknown to me. If I can simply extract the coordinates, I can fit a spline through those coordinates, thereby getting the equation of the graph. Any ideasp  pCheersp

Negative 115 pSo I am looking for a way to cut a video file to the last 10 seconds of the file. Normally I would use FFMPEG or mencoder but the situation is that the file to be cut is going to be a different size every time its cut. So I found some stuff for a general duration using ffmpeg but the problem is I would need the duration to be in seconds instead of 000000 so then I could just use the var10 for the ss.p  pI dont know if I explained that well enough but in shortp  pDifferent length video every time it is ran, only need the last 10 seconds in a new file. Need something light on resources but still fast.p  pThanks in advance for anyone who answersp

Negative 115 pI am running firefox 25 with version 2.34.0 of the Selenium server jar and my simple test to go to a page, fill in a couple of form values and click on a radio button runs fine.  The radio button is one of a JQuery Buttonset.p  pA colleague has FF 28 and version 2.39.0 of the Selenium jar.  Running exactly the same test, his fails as it doesnt click a radio button.  All the inputs that the test hits are identified by id so no XPathCSS element ident or anything like that.p  pI allowed my FF to update to 28 and started using version 2.39.0 of the Selenium jar and I too now have the test failing to click the radio.  Updating to the latest selenium version 2.41.0 exhibits worse issues as it fails to click the first submit button detailed in the test scriptp  pWe have tried setting the font size for the windows environment to 100 but that has not solved the problem.  If I revert back to FF25 and Selenium 2.34.0, my test runs fine.p  pI cannot find anything useful on the selenium website related to this issue.  I know there was the issue of click events not firing if you had a Windows font size that was not set to 100, but as I say, I have tried that solution to no avail.p  pAnyone else experiencing this issuep  h2Updateh2  pSo we didnt really find an answer to this but a workaround seems to be getting the selenium test to click on the label associated with the radio button you want to click in the buttonset.  In our case, we just made sure that each label had an id then changed the test script to click on the label rather than the radio.p

But Im wondering if that really is true.p  pThe more I researched SSL certificates the more Ive come to realize that all they really are is one company vouching for another. The encryption even on an expired certificate or on a selfsigned certificate works and the encryption is just as secure as one that isnt. Sure, the user is presented with nasty icons and red screens showing that hey this may not be safe But if the user doesnt visit a https prefixed website and only visits a http website, what would be wrong with encrypting data clientside, submitting it to our server, decrypting it server side and viceversap  pEncryption is encryption rightp  pOr what if a WinForms app was created that did the same as above Encrypt data, submit it to our servers and the servers decrypt it.p  pI just cant justify paying thousands of dollars a year to have Verisign, or whoever, issue us a certificate when 99 Im willing to bet of the users on the internet dont even bother checking the validity of the certificate.p  pI obviously want to make sure everything IS secure, and Im not downplaying the role of SSL certificates or keeping things secure, but I just fail to see the logic behind aquiring one, if the same type of encryption can be achieved inhouse with better control and, if you ask me, better security.p  pAny thoughts or opinionsp

Negative 115 pWhat I want to do is have the Parse background job loop through a function repeatedly for every codeUsercode in the database, using that codeUsercodes respective codematchCenterItemcode,

things like codematchCenterItemcode and codeMComparisonArraycode, so that functions arent able to differentiate between users. p  pHow can I properly associate all the functions within this query to each individual user, so that when they save a new object for instancep  precodevar mComparisonArray  Parse.Object.extendMComparisonArray  var newMComparisonArray  new mComparisonArray

For example  JAR File 1 should contain botNumber  1 and botName  Bot1 JAR file 2 should contain botNumber  2 and BotName  Bot2 .. So on till 150.p  pI used to build each of these manually and now it looks cumbersome to build each time this way. Because, if I make any small change in the code, I have to build all 150 Files again. p  pDoes any one have some suggestions as in Can I automate the process and get all 150 JAR in a folder built for mep  pThanks.p

Negative 115 pI am using two different checkbox dropdown menus but both the menus use the same submit button both are in the same form for submitting. p  pOn submit, the checkboxes that are selected are being displayed in a table to the user.

This variable is being used in the query. Though, the problem is, when a user selects an option in BOTH menus, the query should specify the search with the use of an AND the value of menu 1 AND the value of menu 2 must be in the results  if one of them isnt it should return nothing, but there is also a possibility that ONLY a checkbox is selected in menu 1, if this is done then the second AND in the query for column Bmenu2 in the database should be ignored.

My question is how does the handler deal with the receipt of a notification Does the data inside the notification get stored into the userInfo dictionary If so, how do I respond to the receipt by showing and alert and giving a list of actions to the user based upon the notification and its contentp  pThanks,  Siddharthp

Negative 115 pIm trying to stick to the Bootstrap design paradigm of codecontainer gt row gt columncode, but Im admittedly new to this and curious about something. p  pIf Im only putting content in the columns, as I believe Im supposed to do, then Bootstraps CSS puts a 15px gutter at the left and right edges of the page I know it also puts them between disparate columns. For design aesthetics Id like to put a border above my content, and Id like to do so strongwithoutstrong having it run into the gutter space.p  pa hrefhttpplnkr.coedit9lCs7UuvR8KoLRRvX17mppreview relnofollowPlunk includeda. As you can see, When I try to style the same element containing the content, it results in the codebordertopcode attribute blue and green colored in my example running into both gutters. When I create a new element above the content and attribute it with codemarginleft, marginrightcode values, that seems to work for the left edge of the border but not for the right one orange color in my example. I just want the border to line up with my text.p  pWhat is the best way to accomplish this I could change the margins or padding for the element itself but then I feel like Im messing with Bootstraps plumbing.p

It contains the  configuration directives that give the server its instructions.  See ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2gt for detailed information.   Section 1 Global Environment   The directives in this section affect the overall operation of Apache,  such as the number of concurrent requests it can handle or where it  can find its configuration files.     Dont give away too much information about all the subcomponents  we are running.  Comment out this line if you dont mind remote sites  finding out what major optional modules you are running ServerTokens OS    ServerRoot The top of the directory tree under which the servers  configuration, error, and log files are kept.   NOTE  If you intend to place this on an NFS or otherwise network  mounted filesystem then please read the LockFile documentation  available at ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2modmpmcommon.htmllockfilegt  you will save yourself a lot of trouble.   Do NOT add a slash at the end of the directory path.  ServerRoot etchttpd    PidFile The file in which the server should record its process  identification number when it starts.

See also the ltVirtualHostgt  directive.

Include conf.d.conf  User apache Group apache   Section 2 Main server configuration   The directives in this section set up the values used by the main  server, which responds to any requests that arent handled by a  ltVirtualHostgt definition.  These values also provide defaults for  any ltVirtualHostgt containers you may define later in the file.   All of these directives may appear inside ltVirtualHostgt containers,  in which case these default settings will be overridden for the  virtual host being defined.     ServerAdmin Your address, where problems with the server should be  emailed.  This address appears on some servergenerated pages, such  as error documents.  e.g. adminyourdomain.com  ServerAdmin rootlocalhost    ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.  This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify  it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.   If this is not set to valid DNS name for your host, servergenerated  redirections will not work.  See also the UseCanonicalName directive.   If your host doesnt have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.  You will have to access it by its address anyway, and this will make   redirections work in a sensible way.  ServerName www.example.com80    UseCanonicalName Determines how Apache constructs selfreferencing   URLs and the SERVERNAME and SERVERPORT variables.  When set Off, Apache will use the Hostname and Port supplied  by the client.  When set On, Apache will use the value of the  ServerName directive.  UseCanonicalName Off    DocumentRoot The directory out of which you will serve your  documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but  symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.  DocumentRoot varwwwhtml    Each directory to which Apache has access can be configured with respect  to which services and features are allowed andor disabled in that  directory and its subdirectories.    First, we configure the default to be a very restrictive set of   features.    ltDirectory gt     Options FollowSymLinks     AllowOverride None ltDirectorygt    Note that from this point forward you must specifically allow  particular features to be enabled  so if somethings not working as  you might expect, make sure that you have specifically enabled it  below.     This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.  ltDirectory varwwwhtmlgt    Possible values for the Options directive are None, All,  or any combination of    Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews   Note that MultiViews must be named explicitly  Options All  doesnt give it to you.   The Options directive is both complicated and important.  Please see  httphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2modcore.htmloptions  for more information.      Options Indexes FollowSymLinks    AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.  It can be All, None, or any combination of the keywords    Options FileInfo AuthConfig Limit      AllowOverride None    Controls who can get stuff from this server.      Order allow,deny     Allow from all  ltDirectorygt    UserDir The name of the directory that is appended onto a users home  directory if a user request is received.   The path to the end user account publichtml directory must be  accessible to the webserver userid.  This usually means that userid  must have permissions of 711, useridpublichtml must have permissions  of 755, and documents contained therein must be worldreadable.  Otherwise, the client will only receive a 403 Forbidden message.   See also httphttpd.apache.orgdocsmiscFAQ.htmlforbidden  ltIfModule moduserdir.cgt           UserDir is disabled by default since it can confirm the presence      of a username on the system depending on home directory      permissions.          UserDir disable            To enable requests to user to serve the users publichtml      directory, remove the UserDir disable line above, and uncomment      the following line instead           UserDir publichtml  ltIfModulegt    Control access to UserDir directories.  The following is an example  for a site where these directories are restricted to readonly.  ltDirectory homepublichtmlgt     AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig Limit     Options MultiViews Indexes SymLinksIfOwnerMatch IncludesNoExec     ltLimit GET POST OPTIONSgt         Order allow,deny         Allow from all     ltLimitgt     ltLimitExcept GET POST OPTIONSgt         Order deny,allow         Deny from all     ltLimitExceptgt ltDirectorygt    DirectoryIndex sets the file that Apache will serve if a directory  is requested.   The index.html.var file a typemap is used to deliver content  negotiated documents.  The MultiViews Option can be used for the   same purpose, but it is much slower.  DirectoryIndex index.html index.html.var    AccessFileName The name of the file to look for in each directory  for additional configuration directives.  See also the AllowOverride  directive.  AccessFileName .htaccess    The following lines prevent .htaccess and .htpasswd files from being   viewed by Web clients.   ltFiles  .htgt     Order allow,deny     Deny from all ltFilesgt    TypesConfig describes where the mime.types file or equivalent is  to be found.  TypesConfig etcmime.types  DefaultType textplain    The modmimemagic module allows the server to use various hints from the  contents of the file itself to determine its type.  The MIMEMagicFile  directive tells the module where the hint definitions are located.  ltIfModule modmimemagic.cgt    MIMEMagicFile usrsharemagic.mime     MIMEMagicFile confmagic ltIfModulegt    HostnameLookups Log the names of clients or just their IP addresses  e.g., www.apache.org on or 204.62.129.132 off.  The default is off because itd be overall better for the net if people  had to knowingly turn this feature on, since enabling it means that  each client request will result in AT LEAST one lookup request to the  nameserver.  HostnameLookups Off    EnableMMAP Control whether memorymapping is used to deliver  files assuming that the underlying OS supports it.  The default is on turn this off if you serve from NFSmounted   filesystems.  On some systems, turning it off regardless of  filesystem can improve performance for details, please see  httphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2modcore.htmlenablemmap  EnableMMAP off    EnableSendfile Control whether the sendfile kernel support is   used to deliver files assuming that the OS supports it.   The default is on turn this off if you serve from NFSmounted   filesystems.  Please see  httphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2modcore.htmlenablesendfile  EnableSendfile off    ErrorLog The location of the error log file.  If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a ltVirtualHostgt  container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be  logged here.  If you do define an error logfile for a ltVirtualHostgt  container, that hosts errors will be logged there and not here.  ErrorLog logserrorlog    LogLevel Control the number of messages logged to the errorlog.  Possible values include debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,  alert, emerg.  LogLevel warn    The following directives define some format nicknames for use with  a CustomLog directive see below.  LogFormat h l u t r gts b Refereri UserAgenti combined LogFormat h l u t r gts b common LogFormat Refereri gt U referer LogFormat Useragenti agent   combinedio includes actual counts of actual bytes received I and sent O this  requires the modlogio module to be loaded. LogFormat h l u t r gts b Refereri UserAgenti I O combinedio    The location and format of the access logfile Common Logfile Format.  If you do not define any access logfiles within a ltVirtualHostgt  container, they will be logged here.  Contrariwise, if you do  define perltVirtualHostgt access logfiles, transactions will be  logged therein and not in this file.  CustomLog logsaccesslog common    If you would like to have separate agent and referer logfiles, uncomment  the following directives.  CustomLog logsrefererlog referer CustomLog logsagentlog agent    For a single logfile with access, agent, and referer information  Combined Logfile Format, use the following directive  CustomLog logsaccesslog combined    Optionally add a line containing the server version and virtual host  name to servergenerated pages internal error documents, FTP directory  listings, modstatus and modinfo output etc., but not CGI generated  documents or custom error documents.  Set to EMail to also include a mailto link to the ServerAdmin.  Set to one of  On  Off  EMail  ServerSignature On    Aliases Add here as many aliases as you need with no limit. The format is   Alias fakename realname   Note that if you include a trailing  on fakename then the server will  require it to be present in the URL.  So icons isnt aliased in this  example, only icons.  If the fakename is slashterminated, then the   realname must also be slash terminated, and if the fakename omits the   trailing slash, the realname must also omit it.   We include the icons alias for FancyIndexed directory listings.  If you  do not use FancyIndexing, you may comment this out.  Alias icons varwwwicons  ltDirectory varwwwiconsgt     Options Indexes MultiViews     AllowOverride None     Order allow,deny     Allow from all ltDirectorygt    WebDAV module configuration section.   ltIfModule moddavfs.cgt      Location of the WebDAV lock database.     DAVLockDB varlibdavlockdb ltIfModulegt    ScriptAlias This controls which directories contain server scripts.  ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that  documents in the realname directory are treated as applications and  run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to the client.  The same rules about trailing  apply to ScriptAlias directives as to  Alias.  ScriptAlias cgibin varwwwcgibin    varwwwcgibin should be changed to whatever your ScriptAliased  CGI directory exists, if you have that configured.  ltDirectory varwwwcgibingt     AllowOverride None     Options None     Order allow,deny     Allow from all ltDirectorygt    Redirect allows you to tell clients about documents which used to exist in  your servers namespace, but do not anymore. This allows you to tell the  clients where to look for the relocated document.

Negative 115 pOur application crashes randomly. Platform is RedHat Linux, java version is jdk 1.617. It is a swing based application having lot of native code. The behavior is quite random. Sometimes it crashes in few minutes and some times it crashes after some hours or after long run. I the pid files sometimes points to ReferenceHandler thread where the crash happened. It is during free operation. Sometimes it crashes in EDT during malloc operation and each time our code is not involved.

Negative 115 pI wonder if theres a way in Android development to receive a couple of information bits regarding touch from a view.p  pSince I am working with a game framework, that is, a loop calling codeupdatecode and codedrawCanvas ccode every 16th millisecond, I rely less on components and more on a solid touch state, hence Id wish to strongavoid using eventsstrong such as codeOnTouchListenercode for input purposes, and rather get them straight from a method.p  pA noticible example is when working with Java UI such as JFrame, where calling codeMouseInfo.getPointerInfo.getLocationcode would return the location of the mouse pointer on the desktop environment. Inside a method getting repetitively called, this could replace event listeners.p  pAre there such methods in Android development for if a view or the entire screen is being pressed, what position the touch takes place etc. etc.p  pOr are events not that hungry for performance in this case that I thought theyd bep  pThank you very much in advance.p
Negative 115 pIve set up a simple loop to poll an IronMQ messaging system, and everything works fine... except that memory usage increases more and more until it finally stabilizes at over 250MB. Ive read that its normal for Node to use more memory over time when run in a sort of recursive loop like this, even when running setTimeout and doing nothing, but I still dont understand the exact mechanics behind this behavior, or whether there is any way to control it. When making HTTP requests within the loop, memory usage more than doubles.p  pThe code is running on a Heroku worker with a limit of 512MB RAM, leaving no breathing room to use cluster to use the rest of the available CPU cores. The memory usage can increase slowly or extremely quickly, depending on the jobs that run after receiving the messages.p  pThis is the simplest code that reproduces this.p  precodefunction loop    request.gethttpwww.example.com, functionerr, request, body      if err console.logerr      setTimeoutloop, 200     codepre  pIve tried many, many ways of restructuring this code to prevent memory from increasing so high, but nothing has made any changes. Only the received HTTP response seems to have any effect on the upper limit of RAM used.p  pIs there a way to rewrite this entirely, or am I stuck with V8s behavior All examples Ive found use the same basic structure for infinite async loops, from kue to the async library.p

Negative 115 pI am trying to get a primefaces checkbox datatable to select multiple rows and pass those values to the bean. I have an ajax event for rowSelect and that works fine, but the ajax for rowSelectCheckbox never fires and it is as if my checkboxes are unclickable. When selecting a row the rowSelect ajax event fires and highlights the entire row and checks the checkbox. However, I am unable to check any other checkboxes off so it is obvious only the rowSelect ajax works and not the rowSelectCheckbox.

It feels like the select doesnt work at all until you hit the back button and briefly see the selection dialog just before you return to the parent activity.p  pIt seems as though when I append the codeWebViewcode to the layout in the second activity, its modals get attached to that activitys window, but the codeWebViewcode itself is attached to the parent activitys window, so it shows in a higher point in the hierarchy.p  pHow can I possibly change the codeContextcode of the codeWebViewcode after its been instantiatedp  pThis is a very difficult problem to solve  I have to create the WebViews before the activity is started, but I also need the selection dialogs to work.p  pPlease if anyone can give me some insights here Id greatly appreciate it.p  pThis is for an SDK project, so I will not have access to the parent activity.

Negative 115 pI have a Python program that is already multithreaded and Id like to replace some of the threads with processes in order to reduce context switching and utilize gevent for async IO.br The main process is IO bound so Id like to use gevent in order to be able to handle a lot of concurrent IO. Well call it the Receiver component of my system.  p  pThe rest of the program is mostly CPU bound so Id like to have each process have some threads that handle requests from the Receiver. These are my worker processes.br The reason that I chose threads for handling multiple requests in one process is because threads are cheaper to create and destroy. If the program receives a lot of requests it can automatically scale to start more threads in order to handle more requests. When the load decreases it can get rid of the extra threads in order to avoid the extra overhead of context switching.p  pForking with gevent can cause some problems and a hrefhttpgehrcke.degipc relnofollowgipca exists exactly to solve those problems.br The worker threads do sometimes read from various sources such as cache and databases but if I understand correctly the GIL will switch to another thread when IO occurs.  p  pIf I do decide I want gevent inside my workers I can I think avoid monkeypatching the threading module and assign a greenlet pool for each worker process. Will the GIL still be released when IO occurs and another thread will start executing until the IO call completes when combining gevent with threadsp  pFinally theres another process which saves the response to a database. Its naturally IO bound so gevent would be an excellent choice to perform this action.p  pI have read about the a hrefhttpwww.linuxprogrammingblog.comthreadsandforkthinktwicebeforeusingthem relnofollowdangers of mixing threads and preforka. Im not going to create any threads in the main process so no locking mechanisms such as mutexes will be copied to the child processes. I am not going to fork any of my child processes. Is it safe to assume Im not in trouble in any stage of this design  Does Python mitigate some of the problems with preforking and threadingp

Negative 115 pIm relatively new to Android and am creating a Bluetooth App on a Nexus 9 that will connect to a Bluetooth device application my coworker has written on an Arduino processor.  Im following this doc, which is very helpfulp  pa hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsconnectivitybluetooth.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsconnectivitybluetooth.htmlap  pHowever, to connect as a client I have to use this code, which uses this MYUUID symbol.p  precode       MYUUID is the apps UUID string, also used by the server code         tmp  device.createRfcommSocketToServiceRecordMYUUID codepre  pIn the text the doc says The UUID passed here must match the UUID used by the server device when it opened its BluetoothServerSocket with listenUsingRfcommWithServiceRecordString, UUID. Using the same UUID is simply a matter of hardcoding the UUID string into your application and then referencing it from both the server and client code.p  pThis is confusing to me... does it mean it must match a UUID specified in the Arduino firmware My coworker who wrote the firmware doesnt know what that would be.  When I sniff his firmware advertising, it has ID RNBTDFBC, but when I use that as a UUID I get an exception p  precodejava.lang.IllegalArgumentException RNBTDFBC is not a valid Bluetooth address codepre  pAnd none of the sample Bluetooth projects Ive looked at seem to explain the basis of this UUID value, theyre just magic numbers.p  pSo... what on earth do I use as the parameter for my createRfcommSocketToServiceRecord function  I feel like I am misunderstanding this, because a Bluetooth client cant possibly generally have such intimate knowledge of a server it wants to connect to.

Negative 115 pRecently, I have been using a number of haskell libraries from cabal in a few of the small personal projects that I am working on, primarily using my laptop which is running Debian 7 Wheezy. While I  feel that I would benefit from upgrading my haskell platform ghc7.4.1, as provided by the codedebcode package to a more current version, doing so is not so straightforward, as I am also using XMonad specifically under Gnome with XMonad, which is bundled with the codedebcode XMonad package as my exclusive window wrangler, as well as xmobar. Apart from wanting to have a more uptodate ghc, I also would like to upgrade xmobar, as the version I am using 0.14 has an issue with the kernel I am using 3.16.7 where the RAM usage is displayed as a negative value. Without guidance, however, I am wary to mess around with my machine, and so I was wondering whether anyone who has had any similar experience or just general advice as to how to tackle this problem, if it is even practical to do so. I can provide any specific details about the versions of various programspackages I have installed, what is installed with aptitude vs. manually, and any other information that would help.p

Negative 115 pI got a problem in decrypting some information in Noptepad. The situation is, that I have installed notepad and I used it to crypt some info. by using NppCrypt plugin. Everything was ok, I mean I used to decrypt and crypt several times using a pwd for that, nothing special. The problem occured when I reinstalled the program. I can not decrypt anymore those info by using the previous pwd. I was thinking that pwd also was introduced in generated code and somehow it takes from there. I need to decrypt those data, no matter how. I hope I was explicit about the problem and maybe someone can help me with that. Thank you.p

Negative 115 pI have an application which I took over recently.  It is a web app running in Tomcat 7 in a Windows environment Windows Server 2008 R2.  The install unpacks to its own folder structure [appName][version number]tomcat...  and then I uninstall and reinstall the service to point to the new version.  This is how it was handed over to me and I am no expert on Tomcat.p  pUp until about a week or 2 ago when I did my last install on UAT all has been well.  I ran java  jar [appname]installer[version].jar and the application installed to a new folder in the structure.  Yesterday we put the latest version live and the war file did not unpack.  The final message is a success message but although the new folder structure is created the E[appname][version number]tomcatwebapps folder contains an unpacked ROOT.war. p  pI am now convinced the problem is in the environment as it now happens on a test server which was fine before and also I tried it with a previous version of the app and this is also suffering the same issue.p  pIm sure there have been no changes to the configuration of Tomcat, which makes me wonder if it may be a Windows update issue which has caused a problem p  pDoes anyone have any ideas   Ive copied the output of the false success below in case it helps ...

So Ive created repository pattern that helps me to make some actions with DB. It is generic and I have to say that in repositiry constructor I create new context. That means when my repository just created in each table I do not have any entities local. Here is my problem when I add new user, for example, I just have to attach UserId and after that entity framework should return me value of Role property when I ask it, shouldnt it When I add a new user and save changes in DB my new user in dbSet has null value of Role property local and in DataBase too. So when I use Find method or another query to receive User this property anyway returns me null. But when I make query in debug mode in context to show me Roles in DBRoles table, Find method or whatever returns me User with not null Role property value. Also I mentioned that after disposing my repository and creating a new one everything works fine. If Im right the problem is in local data because I do not have any roles Local and thats why I cant give me the role for the User. In conclusion I have to say that Im confused I know that after reading this post with my perfect english you are confused too Please help someonep  pHere I add two new users and commit changessave changes in dbp  precode             var repo  new TheatreRepositoryltUsergt         var repo2  new TheatreRepositoryltRolegt         var userRoleId  repo2.GetAll.Firstrole gt role.RoleType  RoleType.User.RoleId         var newUser  new User                                                          UserId  Guid.NewGuid,                               City  Minsk,                               RoleId  userRoleId,                               FirstName  Slavik,                               Email  SlavaMinskgmail.com,                               Password  dsas1qsqda,                               LastName  Fedorov                                   repo.AddnewUser         repo.Commit         var user  repo.GetByIdnewUser.UserId         var userAgain  repo.GetAll.FirstOrDefaultuser1 gt user1.UserId  newUser.UserId codepre  pBoth of queries returned newUser with null Role property value.

Negative 115 pHi Im working with socketio with mrniko nettysocketio on server side with java and socketio.js 0.9.6 on client side. As per documentation of websocket, the server can check whether a client is connected or disconnected from the server by using the pingpong protocol i.e. server sends ping and client respond with pong to confirm its alive. But they said there is no method for client which can check whether server is alive. But at the same time we have onDisconnect Method on client side. I want to know how it actuelly works and if a client misses a hearbeat from server then what does server do  does it disconnects the client or waits for sometime to send the heartbeat again and what is the time for establishing a connection between client and server p

Negative 115 pI have few basic questions about dynamic object creation using Javascript. I understand that browser takes care of allocating memory space for any new keyword found in the JS.

That is my first query.p  precodefunction sample    var a  5       is the memory allocated for variable a in stack    var b  new obj1  The object instance created for obj1 gets allocated in heap   var obj1  function    this.strDate    codepre  pQuery 2 Once the execution scope is out of function sample, will the browser engine free the memory allocated for both the variables. I have read about GCs reference algorithm amp mark and sweep algorithm and recommendations to assign null to variables once not in use, yet could not get a clear cut idea on the standards to be followed as we would do in C. If variable a is there in stack, then I need not worry and if obj1 instance is no longer accessible or say unmarked or no further reference to it, will it also be cleared by GC .p  pQuery 3 Do browsers differ in allocating and freeing memory for the instances created using new operator.  I had seen only about heap profilers in chrome and rather few more terms related to it, but I have also come across out of stack space error. Does that mean all browsers would universally use both stack and heap p  pPlease help me out here p

I want to change first bit to true so it becomes strong11000110strong which is strong198strong. What I dont understand or where Im confused is methods I found.p  precodepublic static void Setref byte aByte, int pos, bool value      if value              leftshift 1, then bitwise OR         aByte  byteaByte  1 ltlt pos          else              leftshift 1, then take complement, then bitwise AND         aByte  byteaByte amp 1 ltlt pos        public static bool Getbyte aByte, int pos      leftshift 1, then bitwise AND, then check for nonzero     return aByte amp 1 ltlt pos  0  codepre  pIn these methods when I want to change first bit I have to pass position 7 Which I guess is index of last of 8 bits. Why is that Why is first bit in byte changed with index of lastp

Negative 115 pI did built an application with Enthought Traits, which is using too much memory. I think, the problem is caused by trait notificationsp  pThere seems to be a fundamental difference in memory usage of events caught by ontraitchange or by using the special naming convention e.g. foochanged .

Now the 450MB became 750MB. p  pEDIT 3 Compiled traits4.6.0.dev0py2.7winamd64 myself. The outcome is the same as in EDIT 2.

I could execute this a separate query and save the result in the serverside scripting.p  pHowever, a more elegant solution from my point of view is to store this within the strongBOOKINGstrong table itself. That is to add a column noofbookings that counts the number of times the current PKroomnumber appears as the foreign key FKroomnumber within the strongCUSTOMERBOOKINGstrong table. And why do this instead Because it would be impossible for me to write a single complicated query which will both include the information from all ROOMS, among other tables, and also count the occurrences of bookings, without excluding ROOMS that dont have any bookings. A very bad thing for a hotel website attempting to show free rooms p  pSo it would look like thisp  pstrongBOOKINGstrong PKroomnumber 104B roomtype double roomprice high, noofbookings 3  strongBOOKINGstrong PKroomnumber 108C roomtype single roomprice low, noofbookings 1  strongCUSTOMERBOOKINGstrong FKroomnumber 104B FKcustomerid 4312 strongCUSTOMERBOOKINGstrong FKroomnumber 104B FKcustomerid 6372 strongCUSTOMERBOOKINGstrong FKroomnumber 104B FKcustomerid 1112 strongCUSTOMERBOOKINGstrong FKroomnumber 108C FKcustomerid 9181p  pHow would I go about creating thisp

Negative 115 pI have a JS code which should do some things animations etc. BEFORE ReactJS possibly or not will update HTML element. Im getting the whole template for this HTML element i.e. part of the page, in particular a widget for this purpose.p  pFor example, I have a DIV with some content, which may change in time or not. Then I get a new version i.e. as HTML template of that DIV through AJAX call, and I want ReactJS first to strongcompare the actual or virtual current DOM with the one just retrieved new HTML template for the same DIV in a stringstrong as got from AJAX call on success. Only then  when these two are different  it makes sense to do animations first, and only then update the actual DOM in the browser by React JS.p  pHow to do that Is there a method in React JS that allows me to get e.g. truefalse when comparing virtual DOM with its new version as a HTML template got through AJAX since it does internally this thing anyway  i.e. comparing current and updated DOM in its algorithmp  pstrongEDITstrong Hmm after initial thought that ReactJS is way much better than other JS Frameworks in my case i.e. server functionality is already developed, I found multiple features not flexible enough further more, I found ReactJS is not smart enough to figure out that only one element at the top of the list is added ReactJS replaces the whole DOM template for the list, even with keys set for each element, which suggests its still not that mature as one could expect. Besides, all Lifecycle methods with ComponentUpdate are not called only ComponentUnmount are being called in the case of mentioned list. I can do it in a simpler way by myself, however Relay  Flux  ReactJS architecture is still nice, and I think Ill just abandon Facebooks implementation, and replace it with my own solution, inspired by RelayFluxReactJS.p

Negative 115 pI want to be able to read the active profiles from a property file so that different environments dev,prod etc can be configured with different profiles in a Spring MVC based web application. I know that the active profiles can be set through JVM params or system properties. But I would like to do it through a property file instead. The point is that I dont know the active profile statically and instead want to read it from a properties file. It looks like this is not possible. For eg., if I had spring.profiles.activedev in application.properties, and allow it to be overridden in override.properties like sop  precodeltbean idpropertyConfigurer classorg.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurergt     ltproperty nameignoreResourceNotFound valuetrue gt     ltproperty namelocationsgt         ltlistgt             ltvaluegtclasspathapplication.propertiesltvaluegt             ltvaluegtfileoverrides.propertiesltvaluegt         ltlistgt     ltpropertygt ltbeangt  codepre  pthe profile is not being picked up in the environment. I guess this is because the active profiles are being checked before bean initialization, and therefore do not honor the property being set in a properties file. The only other option I see is to implement an ApplicationContextInitializer that will load those property files in order of priorityoverride.properties first if it exists, else application.properties and set the value in context.getEnvironment. Is there a better way to do it from properties filesp

Negative 115 pI am using the play framework to develop a web application which accesses a postgres db using JOOQ and spring transactions. p  pCurrently I am implementing the user signup which is structured in the following wayp  ol liThe user posts the signup formli lipThe request is routed to a controller action which maps all parameters like email, password etc. on a DTO. The different fields of the DTO are annotated with JSR 303 constraints.p  pThe email field is annotated with a constraint validator that makes sure that the same address is not added twice. This validator has an autowired reference to the codeUserRepositorycode, so that it can invoke its codeisExistingEmailcode method.pli lipThe signup method of the user service is called, which basically looks as followsp  precodeTransactionalisolation  Isolation.SERIALIZABLE public User signupUserUserDto userDto      validator.validateuserDto     userRepository.adduserDto     return tutor  codepreli ol  pIn case of a validation error the codevalidator.validateuserDtocode call inside of the service will throw a RuntimeException.p  pPlease note that the repositorys codeaddcode method is annotated with codeTransactionalpropagation  Propagation.MANDATORYcode while the codeisExistingEmailcode method does not have any annotations.p  pMy problem is that when I post the signup form twice in succession, I receive a unique constraint error from the database since both times the codeuserRepository.isExistingEmailcode call returns false. However, what I would expect is that the second signup call is not allowed to add the user to the repository, as I set the isolation level of the transaction to serializable.p  pIs this the expected behavior or might there be a JOOQspring transactions configuration issuep  pI added a codeTransactionSynchronizationManager.isActualTransactionActivecode call in the service to make sure a transaction is actually active. So this part seems to work.p

Now the problem is, if I overlay a codedivcode on top of this codevideocode say using position absolute, A round shape appears on the top of this overlay.

Negative 115 pAfter spending more than few days on debugging, I cant find the reason why my code below creates additional spaces when printing out the error check expecting or missing. For example, when I run each of these line of symbols one at a time in order.p  pThe first two works fine, but the third line of input will error check at the wrong position. But the symbol that its expecting is correct lt. When I remove the call to the reset function in the bottom of my code, the error check of the third line of input will be at the correct position but the symbol that its expecting is incorrect  . Most likely because the stack hasnt reseted from the previous line of inputs. p  pI made print statements on the values of the increments for printing spaces and the size of the char array itself, but the numbers are correct. The culprit might be the reset function I made, but the character resets fine. Only problem is that the output is creating additional spaces when printing out the error check, which leads to displaying the error check at the wrong position.p

Negative 115 pIm using Luanch4j to distribute a jar so it can be easily executed under windows. The jar is a CLI tool that takes multiple arguments. So when a player wants to use it, he actually needs to have a terminal cmd open.p  pId like the default behavior of launch4j to be to open that command line window if the exe is directly double clicked. Currently, when i double click on it, it launches my tool which prints out the help as no argument has been given then the windows closes before anything could be read. One solution would be to find out how i can keep the cmd window open after the help has been printed for the user to be able to input his commands.p  pThanksp
