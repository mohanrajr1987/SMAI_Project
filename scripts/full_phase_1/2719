Consider replacing associative containers with sorted vectorsp  pThe standard associative containers are typically implemented as balanced binary search trees. A balanced binary search tree is a data structure that is optimized for a mixed combination of insertions, erasures, and lookups. That is, its designed for applications that do some insertions, then some lookups, then maybe some more insertions, then perhaps some erasures, then a few more lookups, then more insertions or erasures, then more lookups, etc. The key characteristic of this sequence of events is that the insertions, erasures, and lookups are all mixed up. In general, theres no way to predict what the next operation on the tree will bep

Positive 2719 pI am trying to understand the concept of iterator invalidation in vectors. From some of the reading I have done I have found that if a vector contains say 7 elements and you delete the element on the 5th index then the iterators from 5th element onwards become invalidated.

Positive 2719 pWith codestdatomiccode, there seems to be no standardscompliant way to sometimes readwrite without atomicity. Boost has interlocked operations, but they are in the codedetailscode namespace so I dont think Im supposed to use it. But I dont know all of boost. Is there something in boost or stl that I could use Or perhaps a proposal which would address this, like maybe adding a codestdmemoryordernosynchronizationcode Or access an abstraction of the interlocked machineryp  pIt seems like the need for this would appear in many designs. Objects that require threadsafety might be held temporarily in a singlethreaded context, making atomic access superfluous. For example, when first constructing an object, it would usually be visible only on the thread creating it, until placed somewhere accessible to multiple threads. So long as your object is only reachable by a single thread, you wouldnt need codestdatomiccodes safety at all. But then once ready, youd publish it to other threads, and suddenly you need locking and enforced atomic access.p  pIn this particular application, Im building large lockless trees. During construction, there is just zero need for interlocked, so the existing design which calls osprovided interlocked functions does not use interlocked until it becomes necessary. After it becomes visible to other threads, all threads should be using an interlocked view. I cant port to codestdatomiccode without introducing a bunch of pointless synchronization.p  pThe best I can even think of now is to use codestdmemoryorderrelaxedcode, but on ARM, this is still not the same as nonatomic access. On x86amd64 it is though. Another hack is placement new on codestdatomiccode, which writes a new value without atomicity, but that doesnt provide any way to read back the value nonatomically.p

Positive 2719 pI asked a rather poorly formulated and duly poorly received, whoops question similar to this yesterday that Ive had time to think about and better explain and I also made some progress in attempting to figure out the issue, so here goesp  pI have a class codeStatecode and a class codeNodecode. codeNodecode contains a pointer to a codeStatecode as a memberp  precodeclass State public     int a     int b     Stateint a1, int b1         a  a1         b  b1        class Node public     State s     NodeState s1         s  s1          Node         s  NULL        int main      State s  new State5, 6     State z  new State5, 6     Node n  new Nodes     setltStategt states     states.inserts     coutltltstates.countz     return 0  codepre  pYou can see in codemaincode that Im creating two identical pointers to codeStatecode, inserting one into the set, and then using codestatecountcode returns 1 for found, 0 for not found to look for a codeStatecode identical to codezcode in codestatescode. This should return 1, but it returns 0. I thought at first this was because I needed to overload the comparator between codeStatescode, but even after writing this functionp  precodebool operatorconst State amps1, const State amps2     ifs1.a  s2.a ampamp s1.b  s2.b         return true     else         return false  codepre  pIm returning 0. My next idea was because this was a set of pointers to codeStatecode rather than the actual objects, and because of that my  overload was being bypassed. So I tried thisp  precodeint main      State s  new State5, 6     State z  new State5, 6     Node n  new Nodes     setltStategt states     states.inserts     coutltltstates.countz     return 0  codepre  pTheres a running example of this here a hrefhttpideone.comiYQyBK relnofollowhttpideone.comiYQyBKap  pMy idea was to have a set of codeStatecode rather than pointers to codeStatecode and then dereference the pointers to pass in, but unfortunately this new code gives me all sorts of ugly compilation errors which are very obscure and seem to have something to do with a failure during comparison, but I cant really tell what they mean. Whats my best move here to get codesetcountcode to work properly or to find some other way to check if a codeStatecode is in my codesetcodep

Positive 2719 pI am attempting to conduct operations on rows of matrices in a list format to calculate portions of a Hessian matrix mixed partial derivatives matrix for some software I am writing. I found that I could only do this so fast in R even with parallelization, and so have switched over to Rcpp for quicker speed and RcppEigen for the high level matrix operations provided. When I have relied on the List type for representing lists of matricesvectors passed from R, my Cpp code slows down tremendously as the length of the lists each element being a matrix or vector increases. I am not sure exactly why, but it may be because of dynamically sized objects My questions is Can I pass a list from R into a vector container from the Standard Template Library STL using RcppEigen via something like the followingp  precodevectorltEigenMapltEigenMatrixXdgtgt AasltvectorltEigenMapltEigenMatrixXdgtgt gtAA  codepre  pThe reason I want to do so is because I have read that accessing vectors is much faster than accessing lists. However, I may have misinterpreted this and I apologize if so.p  pThe idea is to pass in a list of vectors B2 and a list of matrices A2. Within each index of these lists, I iterate over the rows of the matrix A in the current index of A2 and the vector b in the current index of B2, calculatingp  pb[j]  tA[j,]  A[j,]p  pfor j from 0 to rows1. I would end up with a list with size equal to the number of rows of the matrix in that index, then move on to the next index of the outer limit, etc.  p  pHere is a reproducible example of what I have been able to do using Listp  precodelibraryinline libraryRcppEigen librarymicrobenchmark       Create function which takes list into Rcpp and does all manipulations internally no lapply outside A2 lt lapply12, functiont matrixrnorm10  t, nrow  t, ncol  10 B2 lt lapply12, functiont rnormt   This becomes slower relative to R as the size increases.

Negative 2719 pI have a databases table with 50K rows in it, each row represents a job that need to be done.

Negative 2719 pIm working on a Outlook 2007 AddIn using VSTO and one of the things my addin is supposed to do is to import contacts using web service.p  pThe algorithm for that is very simple it asks web service for a list of identifiers of items that needs to be synchronized and then it fetches them and saves in Outlook.p  pThe problem happens when I have to synchronize large number of records a 1000 for example. At first its pretty fast synchronizing 100 records in like 15 seconds, but the more records it gets the slower it is. After fetching 900 records it needs around a minute and half to fetch last 100.p  pIm pretty sure thats not the problem of my code because its just very simple something like thisp  precodeforeach int i in idCollection      Contact c  service.GetContacti      Outlook.Contact contact  Outlook.ContactItemThisAddIn.Application.         CreateItemOutlook.OlItemType.olContactItem      contact.FirstName  c.Name      set few more fields like this      contact.Save  codepre  pOne solution I think of is that Outlook may be indexing contacts and it needs to rebuild the index after new element is created. Since Im creating new elements all the time it needs to rebuild index very often and also it has to index more and more items and that might slow it down. But thats only a guess. I didnt find any conformation on that in MSDN.p  pDoes anyone knows how to solve this problemp

Negative 2719 pI imported some data using LOAD DATA INFILE into a MySQL Database.  The table itself and the columns are using the UTF8 character set, but the default character set of the database is latin 1.  Because the default character type of the database is latin1, and I used LOAD DATA INFILE without specifying a character set, it interpreted the file as latin1, even though the data in the file was UTF8.  Now I have a bunch of badly encoded data in my UTF8 colum.  I found a hrefhttpwww.mysqlperformanceblog.com20071218fixingcolumnencodingmessinmysqlthis articlea which seems to address a similar problem, which is UTF8 inserted in cp1251, but my problem is Latin1 inserted in UTF8.  Ive tried editing the queries there to convert the latin1 data to UTF8, but cant get it to work.  Either the data comes out the same, or even more mangled than before.

Negative 2719 pWere building a WCF Web Service using WSSF. The idea is that it will expose our main database via the service and allow us to build various applications and web sites on top of the service. At the moment Im building a simple client app that will download some data from this service, manipulate it then give it to the user as a report CSV file.p  pNow the question is where should the business logic that manipulates the data be located I figured that I would put it inside the service. I already have a business layer in there with simple objects that map almost one to one with the database customer, order etc. I figured that I would make some higher level objects to manipulate the data. For example by using the customer, order and other objects and producing a report etc. I thought the best place for this would be in the business layer for the service. In that way we could reuse this logic for various different applications if needed.p  pUnfortunately my boss doesnt agree. He wants a separation of concerns and said that the correct place for this logic would be in a business layer inside the client app rather than in the service. I guess this could be simpler but I would like to use my powerful object model inside the service business layer to write this code. The objects exposed by the service are not real objects and are really just light weight data structures without the power of the full object model that exists inside the service business layer.p  pWhat do you guys think Thanks a lot for the help.p  pCheers Markp

Negative 2719 pIm experiencing something considered a bug in my situation. Probably this is not a bug but a feature .p  pHeres my casep  pI load a UIScrollView with my content. A part of my content is loaded asynchrone after the view is already loaded. This works great and without issue. Some of these controls however are UITextView controls. Once I set the content text property of these controls after the viewDidLoad my UIScrollView scrolls down to the last UITextView that was set. I want to prevent this and want the UIScrollView to maintain its top scrolled position.p  pIn summary If I set the Text property in the viewDidLoad method no scroll occurs. If I set the Text property on the UITextView after the viewDidLoad method because I load the data asynchronous the UIScrollView will scroll to the last UITextView that was set. I want to prevent this scroll.p  pHow do I achieve this  I have a feeling this is just a property which is set wrong but I cant seem to find it.p  pThanks in advance.p  pEDITp  pIve tried setting the scrollEnabled property to NO before setting the values and to YES after but this didnt have any effect. The ScrollView will still scroll when the text property of the UITextView is set.p

Negative 2719 pI have made 3 planes and positioned them in a way that they make a corner of cube. For some reasons I dont want to make a cube object. The 3 planes have 3 different Texture2Ds with different images. The strange problem is when I render the 3 objects and start rotating the camera, in some perspectives some parts of these 3 planes dont get rendered. For example when I look straight at the corner a hole is created which is shaped as a triangle. This is the image of the problem in a netbeans emulator img srchttpwww.pegahan.comm3g.jpg altalt text  I put the red lines there so you can see the cube better. The other strange thing is that the problem resolves when I set the scale of the objects to 0.5 or less. By the way the camera is in its default position and the cubes center is at 0,0,0 and each plane has a width and height of 2. Does anyone have any ideas why these objects have a conflict with each other and how could I resolve this problem.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2719 pCQt I have a smart pointer to a QObject. Lets say a QWeakPointer. For some external reason something that might happen in another object or due to an event, it is possible that the pointed object gets destroyed. Since I have a smart pointer there will be no dangling reference, so theres no problem. But I always have to check if the pointer is null or not.p  pIm thinking of using the null pattern in order to avoid checking this all the time but Im not sure if this is possible or convenient with a QObject. The idea would be that the pointer points to the object and in case it gets destroyed, the smart pointer changes its pointed object to a null object. Is this a good idea or should I forget it and just check if the pointer is NULL all the timep  hr  pLets show you an example. We have a worker who uses a tool to do its workp  precodeclass Worker  public QObject      QOBJECT  public     WorkerQObject parent  0     void work              ifmtool             mtoolgtuse         emit workCompleted       signals     workCompleted  public slots     void setToolQWeakPointerltToolgt tool  private     QWeakPointerltToolgt mtool    class Tool  public QObject      QOBJECT  public     Tool  public slots     void use 0    class Screwdriver  public Tool      QOBJECT  public     Screwdriver  Tool  public slots     void use               do something         class Hammer  public Tool class Saw  public Tool ... codepre  pIn this case, the Tool is a public domain object of a library, which is used by the Worker. Im developing such library. So the worker is using a screwdriver but it gets broken and gets destroyed. No problemp  precodeifmtool     mtoolgtuse emit workCompleted codepre  pmtool is 0 so it simply does nothing. But we have to check that its not null everytime.p  pNow lets say we had a NullTool objectp  precodeclass NullTool  public Tool      QOBJECT  public     NullTool  Tool  public slots     void use               does nothing       codepre  pWhen the tool was destroyed, our pointer would be smart and would know it should point to a NullTool instance. So Workerwork could be implemented like thisp  precodevoid Workerwork      mtoolgtuse     emit workCompleted  codepre  pmtooluse would then get called on the NullTool which does nothing, so there would be no need to check the pointer is not null.p  pIs this a good idea Is it possible with the smart pointer classes Qt provides or should I subclass QWeakPointerp

Negative 2719 pI have a search page that allows the users to filter other users by various categories age, gender, country, region, ethnicity, etc. The first time the search function is called it gets all the possible values for each category from the database. Just wondering though...p  pIs it better to POST this data back each time the page is reloaded in a serialized hidden form field or should I retrieve this information from the database every time the page is loaded.p  pIf i understand the situation correctly, the serialized POST option would increase the sites bandwidth consumption as the data is traveling from the users machine, to the server and back to the users machine again. On the other hand, querying the database everytime would increase the load on the serverdatabase, but would only use half the bandwidth.p  pIf thats the case, what option should I go for...

Negative 2719 pIve been trying to figure out a way to implement faceting with hierarchies in solr and cant figure out how to do it in my situation.  Ive read a couple of the articles on doing hierarchies in solr along with the solutions in patch 64 and 792.  The main issue Im having is that I have entities that can belong to multiple branches of the hierarchy.  The current form of my data is a user document with MVAs for country, state, and city.p  pTake for instance a geographical hierarchy that people can list their services for down to a city level.  A person may service all of alabama but only certain towns in georgia.  Now the faceting count for the state level counts the distinct individuals that service an area which is a 1 for alabama and a 1 for georgia and when expanded down to the city level has a count for each city in other words the sum of the city counts wont necessarily equal the state count since the counts are not mutually exclusive.p  pBLOCKQUOTEUS1 BLOCKQUOTEGeorgia1 BLOCKQUOTEAtlanta1br Columbus0br Athens0 BLOCKQUOTE Alabama1 BLOCKQUOTEMobile1br Birmingham1br Huntsville1 BLOCKQUOTE BLOCKQUOTE BLOCKQUOTEp  pThe part Im getting hung up on is when faceting on the cities I have no way of knowing what state they belong to since the user is listed in both alabama and georgia and I cant figure out a way to relate attributes to each other.  solr64 might work if it supports multiple branches like USAlabamaMobile and USGeorgiaAtlanta for the same document. As of right now I havent been able to get it to compile with the nightly build though so Im kind of stuck.p  pDoes anyone have a better way of doing this p

Negative 2719 pWheres the recommended location for libraries in Rails 3 Is it as simple as libp  pIm not sure because lib seems more like a Rails 2 remnant, especially considering that its no longer autoloaded and there was a lot of discussion about that, apparently.p  pInitializers are more for obviously initialization tasks such as overrides.p  pSpecifically I have a small module for attachment handling Paperclip doesnt fit here thats too large and distinct to include in my model, but not generic or worthwhile enough to implement as a gem.p  pFrom a functionality standpoint it lives somewhere in the middle among the model, view, and controller. This makes it sound like a helper, but in Rails helpers are intended for views AFAIK.p  pShould I just put it in lib and autoload it in application.rb Or maybe I could create a custom form builder to handle the presentation or both.p  pI know how to make it work, but Im hoping to learn something new. p

So for the attributes I need to access, which are cost and price, they are both located in codemcatalogproductentitydecimalcode p  pSo a products price attribute would look like this in the tablep  precodevalueid    entitytypeid  attributeid    storeid    entityid   value 6401             4              64             0            2184      399.9500 codepre  pThe valueid is just the rows unique value, entitytypeid 4 means this is a product attribute. The attributeid is associated with the actual attribute. In this case, 64 is the attributeid for price. Storeid is irrelevant. Entityid is the actual product id, and the value is the actual price of the item. p
Negative 2719 pThere are a class of Android applications that enable password protection on certain userspecified apps for example, a hrefhttpwww.androidpassword.comAndroid Protectora. I need to approach this problem from a different direction.p  pIs it possible to create an application that blocks all activity launches unless they are on a predefined whitelist Will there be unintended consequences with this approach I am familiar with Android basics and have written a few reasonably simple apps, but Im still trying to figure out how these Protector apps intercept the launch intents correctly.

My issue is that when Im in portrait mode, I cannot see all of my images. The more I resize my image, the more of the images I can fit, But Im at a point where I do not want it to be any smaller.

Theres no auto resize to fit Also, how can I manually decide how much space is between each image Thanksp

Negative 2719 pI have a job that I am currenlty running to sync data between two databases on different internal servers. The one server is the backend database for the HEAT product from FrontRange. The second is our own reporting database we are using for report writing and other internal uses. p  pOur first approach at the job went something like this Query all the data from the HEAT database tables we wanted and populate local temp tables. Then copy that data out to the appropriate table. That would work but they use to TRUNCATE the table every time and repopulate without doing anything for indexes or fragmentation. So I thought well this could be a good candidate to use the SQL merge statement.p  pSo our second approach used a merge statement for each of the tables. It greatly improved the speed of the process but it seems to be locking the source table up so that users are noticing 1530 second delays when they try to save information. To make the merge only handle records that have had changes or are new I added the BINARYCHECKSUM function on the select and store it on my side so that I can avoid updating records that havent changed. Seems expensive though to call that for every record. This table has about 300k records.p  pI am wondering is there a better approach to try and synchronize these two tables that I am overlooking. My only constraint is that I really do not want to change anything on the source tables because it is a third party application.p  pHere is my mege statement I am using for the CallLog tablep  precode

However, to me it seems like thats the case here as proper dependencies are in place clientshared, servershared, IServerReceiver place in shared. Another aspect of the exception I dont quite understand is since JDK 1.5, stub generation through rmic is no longer necessary and is achieved through dynamic proxyies. The client therefore only needs access to the interface IServerReceiver in order to create the dynamic proxy. Why would he be complaining about not finding the ServerReceiverStub class at all thenp  pSince the integration test runs successfully and within that test the client also has access to the emimplementationem of the IServerReceiver interface, am I right in assuming that the client needs not only access to the remote interface but also its implementationp  pIm pretty confused by now so maybe you can help me shed some light on this matter Thanks for having read that long post p  pCheers, Chrisp

I created a Text Input some place else, and all the keys work... I moved that same input using jquery inside the toolbar... and the backspace and arrow keys stop working... if I move it out, the keys start working again Sp  pI need it to be a text input because Im planning on using a jQuery plugin which hides the current input and replaces it with another input... so you see... even if I use textfield, the textfield will get hidden and a text input will replace it without backspace and arrow keys functionalityp  pAny help will be greatly appreciatedp  pRegardsp

Negative 2719 pI have a registration page that uses PHP validation. The PHP comes in a separate file. I used session to pass the error messages from the php validation handler to the registration page. I used unsetsession for other pages so when the user navigates from other page, the error msgs will be unset. What if the user tries to refresh the page by clicking the link of registration again from the navigation bar I cannot unset the error messages from the start of registration page because it will unset the session variables before the error messages displays.p

This   could be due to attempting to access a service in a crossdomain way   without a proper crossdomain policy in place, or a policy that is   unsuitable for SOAP services. You may need to contact the owner of the   service to publish a crossdomain policy file and to ensure it allows   SOAPrelated HTTP headers to be sent. This error may also be caused by   using internal types in the web service proxy without using the   InternalsVisibleToAttribute attribute. Please see the inner exception   for more details.p blockquote  pMy thoughts on the error message  I think the stuff about cross domain policy is irrelevant, as this set up is all on one machine. Other than that I dont know what to look for. I searched on this for 2 days and even started reading about Code Access Security, CAS, but not sure if that is the source of the problem.p  pAny any thoughts would be much appreciated. If you need more info no problem.p  pThanksp  pRobp

Negative 2719 pMy application has, apart from its activities, a service and an app widget.p  pI wanted that clicking the widgets results in a piece of code executing, a piece which will enabledisable the apps service.

If its not, I call the super.onReceive, so normal app widgets broadcasts will get done.p  pSo far so good the widget works fine.p  pBut, lets say I created it when my apps PID was X. Then, the user left my activities and they are destroyed So as the service  lets say the user closed it. So my process hosts no activities nor services  it is destroyed  being exited from the task manager, both cases are relevant. The next time it is created, it has a different PID, and now, clicking on the app widget DOES NOTHING.p  pThe app widget can still be updated manually, for example, from the activity. But clicking on it doesnt lead top  ol liThe ACTIONENABLEDISABLE broadcast being sent.

Negative 2719 pIm making a call to a program from the shell using the subprocess module that outputs a binary file to STDOUT. p  pI use Popen to call the program and then I want to pass the stream to a function in a Python package called pysam that unfortunately cannot Python file objects, but emcanem read from STDIN. So what Id like to do is have the output of the shell command go from STDOUT into STDIN.p  pHow can this be done from within Popensubprocess module This is the way Im calling the shell programp  precodep  subprocess.Popenmycmd, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE, shellTrue.stdout codepre  pThis will read mycmds STDOUT output and get a stream to it in p. Since my Python module cannot read from p directly, I am trying to redirect STDOUT of mycmd back into STDIN usingp  precodep  subprocess.Popenmycmd, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE, stdinsubprocess.PIPE, shellTrue.stdout codepre  pI then call my module, which uses  as a placeholder for STDINp  precodes  pysam.Samfile, rb codepre  pThe above call just means read from STDIN denoted  and read it as a binary file rb. p  pWhen I try this, I just get binary output sent to the screen, and it doesnt look like the Samfile function can read it. This occurs even if I remove the call to Samfile, so I think its my call to Popen that is the problem and not downstream steps.p  pEDIT In response to answers, I triedp  precodesys.stdin  subprocess.PopentagBamcmd, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE, shellTrue.stdout print Opening SAM..                                                                                             s  pysam.Samfile,rb print Done sys.stdin  sys.stdin     codepre  pThis seems to hang. I get the outputp  precodeOpening SAM.. codepre  pbut it never gets past the Samfile, rb line. Any idea whyp  pAny idea how this can be fixedp  pEDIT 2 I am adding a link to Pysam documentation in case it helps, I really cannot figure this out. The documentation page isp  pa hrefhttpwwwfgu.anat.ox.ac.ukandreasdocumentationsamtoolsusage.html relnofollowhttpwwwfgu.anat.ox.ac.ukandreasdocumentationsamtoolsusage.htmlap  pand the specific note about streams is herep  pa hrefhttpwwwfgu.anat.ox.ac.ukandreasdocumentationsamtoolsusage.htmlusingstreams relnofollowhttpwwwfgu.anat.ox.ac.ukandreasdocumentationsamtoolsusage.htmlusingstreamsap  pIn particularp  p Pysam does not support reading and writing from true python file objects, but it does support reading and writing from stdin and stdout. The following example reads from stdin and writes to stdoutp  precodeinfile  pysam.Samfile , r  outfile  pysam.Samfile , w, template  infile  for s in infile outfile.writes codepre  pIt will also work with BAM files. The following script converts a BAM formatted file on stdin to a SAM formatted file on stdoutp  precodeinfile  pysam.Samfile , rb  outfile  pysam.Samfile , w, template  infile  for s in infile outfile.writes codepre  pNote, only the file open mode needs to changed from r to rb. p  pSo I simply want to take the stream coming from Popen, which reads stdout, and redirect that into stdin, so that I can use Samfile, rb as the above section states is possible.p  pthanks.p

Negative 2719 pOK.  I am sending text messages through my app.  After a text message is sent, it sends a status update to a server.  This portion works okay, but the problem I am running into is twofold. I am not sure if they are related, but I assume that they are.p  pMy app has the ability to send a single text to multiple users.  Here is a sample of the code...p  precodeifphoneNumbers.length gt 0 ampamp message.getText.toString.equals  false      forint i0iltphoneNumbers.lengthi              sms  SmsManager.getDefault         try                      sms.sendTextMessagephoneNumbers[i], null, message.getText.toString, null, null             sentQuantity                  catchIllegalArgumentException e                          codepre  pBasically, it just loops through an array of phone numbers, and sends the text one at a time.  Here is where part of my issue lies.  If I choose 3 or more numbers to send the text to, sometimes not all of the texts actually get sent.  It happens very randomly.  p  pI assume it is because there is a delay between sending each individual message, but the code doesnt wait long enough.  I reached this assumption because if I step into the program using eclipse and manually go through the app, everything always works just fine.p  pMy other issue is when I send off the text message status update to a web server.p  pImmediately after the text messages get sent, the app then connects to the internet and tells the server via an http post the number of texts that were sent.  Here is my snippet of internet code...p  precodeforint i  0 i lt postNames.length i      nameValuePairs.addnew BasicNameValuePairpostNames[i], postValues[i]           http post     try              HttpParams httpParameters  new BasicHttpParams             int timeoutConnection  10000              HttpConnectionParams.setConnectionTimeouthttpParameters,timeoutConnection               HttpClient httpclient  new DefaultHttpClienthttpParameters                           HttpPost httppost  new HttpPostwebAddress             httppost.setEntitynew UrlEncodedFormEntitynameValuePairs             HttpResponse response  httpclient.executehttppost             HttpEntity entity  response.getEntity             is  entity.getContent codepre  pThis section just compiles the items for the post, connects to a web page, and sends the post.  The key here is the 10 second connection timeout. Once again, like I said earlier, the internet connection happens immediately after sending the texts.  So, if I go into debug mode and manually step through the process, everything works fine.  But if I just run the app on my phone, I will get a connection time out error.p  pNow, I am hoping that if I can reduce the number of text messages to one single text, regardless of the number of recipients, that would be awesome.  I have tried separating the phone numbers with a comma, and that didnt work.  I also tried separating the numbers with a semicolon exactly like how Microsoft Outlook, or GMail lets you add multiple recipients to an email.  None of those worked for me.  Does anyone have any suggestions Even if there is a different approach altogether, that would be appreciated.  Oh, and I dont want to use the Google Messaging intent to send the messages, I need to use my own app.p

Negative 2719 pI want to be able to change the Device Motion Manager Reference frame for the gyro so that I have my gravity vector on the Y axis.p  pUsually when you start Device Motion Manager Updates you will only have the z axis of the phone aligned with gravity.p  pYou can change this to use the magnetometer to make the x axis be aligned with either the magnetic or true north pole. With this I have my X axis Pointing north and my Z axis pointing down.p  pWhat I want to do is have my Y axis negative pointing down so that its aligned with the gravity and also have  my X  axis pointing the true magnetic pole.p  pThe result I want is such that when have my phone standing still in a vertical portrait orientation the right of the phone will be aligned to the north pole and all my readings roll, pitch, yaw will read as 0. Then with this if i rotate my phone on the X axis the pitch will change, and if I rotate around the Y axis the yaw will change.p  pSo far I know i can set my own reference frame if I multiply by the inverse of the attitude a previously stored attitude, like i could set my phone in this orientation MANUALLY, save that attitude and simply keep multiplying the new attitude by the inverse of this stored one and all my readings will be exactly like the ones i want.p  pBut setting it manually is not an option, so how do i make this programaticallyp  pI dont think there is a function to create my own attitude reference frame, or if at least there was a function to multiply the attitude by a rotation matrix then i could probably solve this. because i would just multiply all the attitude by a 90 degrees change in the pitch.p  pI hope I explained myself clearly,p  pI will appreciate any suggestions. thanksp  pPD These are the iPhone Orientation coordinatesp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWRzv1.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 2719 pMy problem has to do with being able to overwrite the variables declared within a function but not on every recall on the function. Here is my explanationp  pLets say I have three HTML elements when the page is loadedp  precodeltdiv id1gtltdivgt ltdiv id2gtltdivgt ltdiv id3gtltdivgt ltdiv id4gtltdivgt codepre  pI then run a javascript function manipulating each of these elements and applying functions to the onmousemove event. During the function call there are variable that are declared and should NOT be overwritten in order to keep the variable values unique to the element otherwise mouse movement would be overwritten and would only work for the last element. I know this can be achieved by declaring them local variables.p  pMy issue is the next part p  pAfter this has all been done, I then have other events on the page that trigger the initial function to run again on the same element it ran on initially, but with different values, which now have to overwrite the originals. I would post the code but it is a few thousand lines of code so Im hoping you all understand what Im talking about.p  pI think I can fix this issue by duplicating the function and declaring the variables differently, but that would mean having two copies of a large block of code, which is never a good idea, in my opinion and I would like to avoid that.p  pThanksp

Negative 2719 pSo Ive seen a method that several people seem to use where they have one large image a master template image, if you will, and after that image is loaded, there is some sort of script or coding that can isolate individual parts of the image and use just that smaller part for an element such as a button. Such is the case with the letter tiles on Words With Friends on Facebook. Im not talking about how to use Photoshop to separate them. Im hoping for a web page on the matter as well will hopefully some tutorials or examples. Im looking for something I can do with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Or even jQuery.p  pSorry I cant provide any code, since thats what Im after, and I dont know exactly what this method is called either.p

This is not the case for Oracle...p  pWill someone confirm or deny, pleasep  pstrongResolutionstrongp  pOk, so from the link posted by sixfeetsixp  blockquote   pEach entry in an SQLite table has a unique 64bit signed integer key called the rowid. The rowid is always available as an undeclared column... If the table has a column of type INTEGER PRIMARY KEY then that column is another alias for the rowid.p blockquote  pThen his codeautoincrementcode link verifies that the coderowidcode and the autoincrement value will be the same value.p  pThats a wrap, thanks, folksp

Currently I have a simple codeListltArrowTabgt Tabs  get set code property on the user control, and in the pageload of the page hosting the user control I add some sample tabs seen above programmatically, like thisp  precode            TabWizard1.Tabs  new ListltArrowTabgt                              new ArrowTab                                      Text  Project Settings,                     Selected  true                 ,                 new ArrowTab  Text  Groups ,                 new ArrowTab  Text  Products ,                 new ArrowTab  Text  Make Assignments ,                 new ArrowTab  Text  Review Assignments ,                 new ArrowTab  Text  Commitments               codepre  pThis works for adding the button from the code behind but what I actually want is to add the button in the markup for the user control on the page and also associate a different custom user control to that button.

Negative 2719 pId use replication on a big structure. I would know if doing a INSERT on a master will wait for the data to be replicated on all the servers or will end after putting the data on the server the request was run on and then run the replication in background.p  pThanks.p

Negative 2719 pWhen using boxsizing borderbox in CSS, I assume that the total width of an element will be defined in its width value. So if I say that the width of a division is 20px and the right border is 10px, I will end up with a box that takes up the space of 20px and half of it is the right border. Pushing it to the point where I set the width to 10px and the right border, too, like herep  precodebox     overflow hidden     width 10px     boxsizing borderbox     height 100px     background black     borderright 10px solid red  codepre  pthe box will only consist of the red border. What should happen, when I set the width to 0px I thought it would make the whole thing disappear, but no, the result is exactly the same like the one above a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netYVxgK5jsFiddleap  pMy question is if this is the expected behavior. Seems inconsistent to me.  I would like to make a box disappear only manipulating the widthheight. Thanks for any input.p
Negative 2719 pI helped design and implement and Droid API written in PHP.  Though it works just fine, I am always looking to refactor my code.p  pIs it ok to have objects within other objects that have a common ancestor  p  pThis may be an elementary question, but I cant seem to find information to support whether or not this is poor practice.p  pThe goal is to have class foo provide common constants and methods to all.  p  pExamplep  precode            abstract class foo               constants              common methods to all                           class bar extends foo              represents something                           class widget extends foo               represents something else                           class controller extends foo                 controls flow                 public function construct                     thisgtmybar new bar                     thisgtmywidget new widget                            codepre  pClasses bar and widget may not need to extend foo, but methods within those objects wouldnt know about the common things that foo knows without sending parameters.p  pThere seems to be too much redundancy going on, just looking for a bestpractice.p
Negative 2719 pI have been looking at this for to long so I am tossing it to those with more experience then I in hope of a copper or to of knowledge being tossed at me. The code runs with no errors. p  pThe issue is that the second increment of the 1st loop overrides the first increments data range and so on. Loop 1 will populate rows 215. If I look at the address of lastrow it will show me the correct range of b16 as lastrowcell in column to paste to , But as soon as the loop for the next objWorkBook runs it starts overwriting the fist increments cells rather then going to last row. I have a feeling i am missing something silly but it alludes me. p  pAny help or advice would be appreciated. I am relay interested in feed back. this will eventually process 100 workbooks each adding roughly 1000 entries. I am concerned about the efficiency of my code. would using arrays speed things up once things are caught up it will only process 2 workbooks a week.

Negative 2719 pI designed a mini search engine in which I am provided with a bunch of files. What I did is that I crawled these files and I formed a hash table with the key being the hashed value of the word and the table entry is a binary tree which holds all the words with the same hash and some other information related to the word.p  pI understand that this datastructure exists in the memory. I am thinking of scaling the problem. If I was provided with a huge number of entries, the memory will not be able to hold this huge amount of data so I will have to store it persistently on a hard drive. However, as far as I know, data is stored in hard disks as blocks and I, as a programmer, have no control over how the data is stored on disk. So how can I enforce the data to be stored on the disk the same way they were stored in the memory.p  pIn simple words, I understand Data structures are important for processing data in an efficient manner if the right data structure is used, but a programmer controls only the data structure of the data in memory. If the data is large, how can a programmer store data in a disk for efficient retrievalp

Horrible, isnt it Vertical scrolling isnt too hot either.p  pI did the same with a WinForms application and scrolling was butter smooth in all directions, and looked as good as WPF after forcing the codeDataGridViewcodes codeDoubleBufferedcode property to codetruecode.

Negative 2719 pIm facing a problem with a slow custom BizTalk adapter.p  pEvery night, an application sends more than 10000 messages to a MSMQ within a few minutes. Unfortunately it takes hours for BizTalk to process them.p  pI do not have any orchestration, just route the messages to several parties. For one party we had to develop a custom adapter, but this adapterinterface is very slow. So I think BizTalk automatically throttles down the whole application and only reads as many messages from the queue that it can send over this slow adapter.p  pTherefore it takes hours till the MSMQ is empty.p  pIf I stop this slow adapter and e.g. only enable a File Adapter that writes to the local file system, it takes a few seconds to process the thousands of messages from the MSMQ.p  pIs it possible to tweak BizTalk to process the incoming messages faster and just throttle the outgoing messages for this send port Its unfortunate that all other parties have to wait for the messages because of one slow party.p  pThank you for any advicep  pBest regards Michaelp
Negative 2719 pIm working on a redesign of my weather website using Jquery Mobile. p  pI have it set up so that you drill down through a series of content containers to get to the weather info each group of info opens in a dialog display. Everythings worked well, but Ive run into an issue with my images. p  pI have them sized so that they fit a mobile devices screen nicely, but because of that, when you look at them in a desktop browser, you cant really make out what the image is. Ive tried several image lightbox  enlargement solutions, but for some reason, none of them have worked. Either nothing happens or the images open in a new window. I thought that this might be caused by Jquery Mobile somehow overwriting the scripts and css of the lightbox  enlargements Ive tried. Im not completely sure though that this is the case, and if it is, how I can get around it to be able to enlarge the images to their original size, preferably onclick. p  pHere is a working for the most part  still some kinks to work out example.

Negative 2719 pI have multiple XML files that I need to edit everyday. I have no control over the source that reads these files and no control over the format of the XML. p  pThe problem is that each element needs its own sequential number within each block. Sometimes there can be upwards of 200 elements within each block. When I need to insert a command early in an existing long block I must manually renumber each following element which is tedious and error prone. p  pAlso, the namevalue pairs have no connection with the sequential numbering needed.

Unfortunately, I could never get the macro to work correctly.p  pI also looked through the vim plugins at vim.org but I found nothing that I recognized as a solution.p  pVim is new to me but Ive taken a liking to it and this seems like the type of problem its well suited to solving.

Negative 2719 pIm working on a rails app that needs to route users to a specific URL based on their location. Preferably something that will present them the appropriate content based on location with the ability for them to be able to view content for other locations.p  pSpecifically, think of the location interface for Craigslist... Users are presented content from the city they are in and still allowed to select and view another city.p  pIve seen a few posts that answer parts of this question, but Im trying to plan out the best solution.p  pIt looks like there is going to need to be something, probably cookie based, that sets a default location for a given user and still allows them to select other locations.p  pAgain, just looking for conceptplanning assistance and any direction on any gems that might be applicable.p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 2719 pI have two designs for an instant message program that Im writting in Javap  pThe first idea uses 2 separate threads. The first thread overlooks the gui and sends out the instant message data through writing to a blocking socket. The 2nd thread uses another blocking socket to monitor for incoming packets from the friend. Im not certain if using threads is the best way to approach this problem, but I find it to be easier to deal with than using nonblocking socketchannels.p  pThe 2nd design that I have is to use nonblocking socket channels in one thread which will occasionally check to see if there is incoming or outgoing data. The nice thing about this design is that I dont have to worry about resource sharing among threads, but Im not sure if its more efficient.p  pHonestly, all I really care about is making a program that runs smoothly and efficiently. What do you think would be a more efficient and easier design to build Im just playing around so I have no experience in building efficient and powerful clientserver programs other than what my senses tell me.p

My options seem to bep  p1 Implement IDisposable on the interface requiring all of the implementations to implement Dispose, even if only an empty method.p  porp  p2 Implement IDisposable on only the classes that have resources needing to be disposed.  This will cause problems with using because my object is created from a factory and therefore all upstream code works against the interface.

However, I could cast the factory result to the implementation however, that then makes the consumer aware of the implementation, defeating the purpose of interfaces.p  pAny ideas as to best practicesp

Negative 2719 pI have an app where i am storing serialized images into websql. I first get the image list from xml, create an array of paths that lead to individual files that return jsonp  individual files so that i can have a progress indicator. After i get the response i pass the serialized image to my db functions that then do the insert, update the image path array on success, and then kick off the next ajax request. This works fine on my local machine. in iOS emulator and device what happens is that at a certain point  say around the 300th image or so, all of my WebSQL transactions fail. They do so without any error code or text so i dont know whats happening there. And its the transaction that fails, not the executeSql.p  pThe length of the serialized data averages about 45k, some get up to 6 digits. There is no pattern on the txns that fail  the string lengths are random  the only consistent thing is that after hundreds of successful txns everything after a certain point fails for the remaining web sql transactions about 157 at that point.p  pThe process is very linear get the data via ajax  check it timestamps, etc  route to the insert function, then repeat.p  pThe size of the SQL lite db on my computer is about 35mb, so I dont think Im hitting a ceiling on the device.p  pThis is wrapped in Cordova2.2. jQuery is used for the Ajax requests as you will see.

Negative 2719 pHey guys I am trying to do a Camera class that uses lookAt from glm library. I have 4 points, the first one is eye, that is the camera position in space, the second one is the look, that is the point where the camera is looking at, the third one is the upp, that set the orientation of camera, and the forth is side, that is a cross product of look  eye and upp eye.p  pSo in the end I got a base of 3 vectors all of them with origin in the eye point. I got a coordinate system of the camera.p  pIn my camera class, I want to be able to rotate about the coordinate system of the camera, not the coordinate system of the world. So what I am doing is rotate about one of the axis of the coordinate system of the camera.p  pI construct the class with initial values like thisp  precodevoid Observerinitializeglmvec3 eye, glmvec3 look, glmvec3 upp, glmvec3 side       thisgteye  eye         0.0, 0.0,  0.0     thisgtlook  look       0.0, 0.0, 1.0     thisgtupp  upp         0.0, 1.0,  0.0     thisgtside  side       1.0, 0.0,  0.0  codepre  pWhen I want to rotate the coordinate system about the x axis for example I call the function from glm like thisp  precodevoid ObserverpitchGLfloat pitch       glmmat4 rotate1.0f      rotate  glmrotaterotate, pitch, side  eye      look  glmvec3rotate  glmvec4look, 1.0f     upp  glmvec3rotate  glmvec4upp, 1.0f  codepre  pSo far, I am understanding that all my points still form a coordinate system for the camera and all vector are perpendicular between each other.p  pBut then I use these points I got with the lookAt function, to position the camera in the world.p  precode glmmat4 view  glmlookAteye, look, upp codepre  pAnd multiply this matrix with the modelview matrix from OpenGLp  pIf I start to rotate a lot, the camera after a few rotations reflect the rotation, like I was rotating in the other way I dont know how to describe what is really happening in a better way s.p  pI really dont understand what is happening. I should normalize the vectors after I apply the rotation Am I having a problem with gimbal lock I dont know a lot about gimbal lockp

Which is why Im asking if there is some automated way to provide this feature so I wont have to go through this if for some reason the URLs on the website change or the path files change etc.. Im starting to believe this doesnt readily exist, but I could be wrong and is why Im asking this.p  pIm willing to do PHP, but would prefer only HTMLCSS which Im going to assume is impossible since you would need the information from the server regardless. I also would like to stay away from JavaScript  Plugins.p  pI hope Ive worded this better if there are any other concerns on what Im requesting I can supply more information and possibly examples. A good example is GitHub and how you have an online navigation of your file storage. I basically want the same for a website only instead of it working exactly how the windows folders work. I want it to be more like each URL is linked to a given Name and I can perform a navigation based off that if possible.p  pHeres are much better examples of a website that uses the idea Im wanting. So as you can see Im looking at a better means of making this work instead of manually doing it all.p  pa hrefhttpservices.runescape.commrswikienMediumQuests relnofollowhttpservices.runescape.commrswikienMediumQuestsa a hrefhttpsgithub.comgitgittreemastergitremotehelpersgit relnofollowhttpsgithub.comgitgittreemastergitremotehelpersgitap  pYoull see that they both supply these navigation menus Ill try finding more if my question still isnt understandable.p

Negative 2719 pI wonder if there is a clean way to do an html form that will get posted if the user pushes a post button and that could be sent as well with the get method if the user pushes a get button. I need this because I would like to show a form which can both enter new data or search for existing data in the database. If the user wants to enter data in the database they could fill the form and send via a send button POST and if they are not sure what they want they can partly fill the form and push the search button GET to receive some insights on what is in the database. From what I know the method is defined for the form, not for the submit buttons. Any idea how I could do that without javascript or with javascriptp

Negative 2719 pI need to add a salt to a hashed column. This hashed column is also used as an index in one of the tables. I dont want to use the same hard coded salt for all values for obvious reasons. p  pWhat can be the best way to generate a unique SAME salt value every time for the given String so when I hash the value i get the same output back to help me search with the hashed value. p  pUpdate Thanks everyone for the inputs.  More details  I have to encrypt a column in the database. This column is also used for searching the row in the table and after encrypting we can not use it for searching because there are chances that we can change the encryption keys at later point of time. Now to counter this we thought of adding a Hashed column in the table on which we can perform the search since we are not going to change the Hashed algorithm we can always use this for searching purpose. To make this hashed column more secure we thought of adding a salt to it. And since Salt should be random we will not be able to generate same hash function every time for same value unless we use the same Salt for all rows. So this is why I was trying to figure out a way where I can generate same salt for same String every time. But I think after going through all the comments and suggestions by you guys one thing I am sure is that this is not a good design and I should rethink on my approach p

Im aware that many people missed to add a column, and the populate methods are not called.p  pDoes anyone know if is it mandatory to use a XIB to create an NSTableView and loaded as a subView with cocos2D Nothing that Ive tested worked to show the table on the screen.p  pThank you very much.p
Negative 2719 pI know the Java libraries pretty well, so I was surprised when I realized that, apparently, theres no easy way to do something seemingly simple with a stream. Im trying to read an HTTP request containing multipart form data large, multiline tokens separated be delimiters that look like, for example, codeWebKitFormBoundary5GlahTkFmhDfanAncode, and I want to read until I encounter a part of the request with a given name, and then return an InputStream of that part.p  pIm fine with just reading the stream into memory and returning a codeByteArrayInputStreamcode, because the files submitted should never be larger than 1MB. However, I want to make sure that the reading method throws an exception if the file is larger than 1MB, so that excessivelylarge files dont fill up the JVMs memory and crash the server. The file data may be binary, so that rules out codeBufferedReader.readLinecode it drops newlines, which could be any of codercode, codencode, or coderncode, resulting in loss of data.p  pAll of the obvious tokenizing solutions, such as codeScannercode, read the tokens as codeStringcodes, not streams, which could cause codeOutOfMemoryErrorcodes for large filesexactly what Im trying to avoid. As far as I can tell, theres no equivalent to codeScannercode that returns each token as an codeInputStreamcode without reading it into memory. Is there something Im missing, or is there any way to create something like that myself, using just the standard Java libraries strongnostrong Apache Commons, etc., that doesnt require me to read the stream a character at a time and write all of the tokenscanning code myselfp  hr  pstrongAddendumstrong Shortly before posting this, I realized that the obvious solution to my original problem was simply to read the full request body into memory, failing if its too large, and then to tokenize the resulting codeByteArrayInputStreamcode with a codeScannercode. This is inefficient, but it works. However, Im still interested to know if theres a way to tokenize an codeInputStreamcode into substreams, without reading them into memory, without using extra libraries, and without resorting to characterbycharacter processing.p

Negative 2719 pIm working on a program that precompiles bytecode from .NET assemblies.  This program is itself a .NET program  so far Ive been able to use reflection to extract all the needed information including the bytecode itself.  However, Ive run into a problem implementing the translation for codeldfldcode.p  pcodeldfldcode and similar instructions have a metadata token within their encoding which references a emFieldRefem or emFieldDefem.  I understand these are elements in metadata tables embedded in the assemblys PE file.  In the worstcase I do have enough information from ECMA335 to open the PE file and look all this up myself, but thats a lot of work and is not consistent with other information which I do get through Reflection, so I would prefer to do this lookup via Reflection.p  pHowever, I cant seem to find any methods on codeSystem.Reflection.Assemblycode that look up a metadata token.  I may have just missed it.  I cant do the lookup on anything more specific than an assembly because I only know the referencing assembly until I see the metadata catch22.  In fact, as noted in the comments, I dont even know what assembly the field is emdefinedem in, until examining the metadata.p  pIs there any way to look up such metadata tokens via Reflectionp
Negative 2719 pI have a self hosted WCF service that listens on port 80 the thirdparty device does not support sending on other ports.  I also have two web sites and three Web API base services that are also on port 80 and have been working well.  All of these servicessites run using different FQDNs testsvc1.example.com, testsvc2.example.com, testsite1.example.com, etc...  It is important to note that all the subdomains point to the same IP Address on the server.  All of this has been working great until I try and install my service that hosts my WCF service.

Negative 2719 pThe TARGETIPHONESIMULATOR macro does not work in the C source I added to the project. Though it should be noted that the code runs if I simply change out the macro with a 1 or a 0.p  pSo heres the setup. Ive been converting the files from  a hrefhttpscode.google.compld48jovocsourcebrowseutiltweakvalr13 relnofollowhttpscode.google.compld48jovocsourcebrowseutiltweakvalr13a to work with the iOS application Im making in XCode.p  pEverything is pretty much the same except for the header.p  precodeifndef TWEAKVALH define TWEAKVALH  ifdef cplusplus extern C  endif  include ltsystypes.hgt   Do only in debug builds on simulator, this does NOT work on iOS device if TARGETIPHONESIMULATOR  replace with 1 or zero to make it work   define TVUSETWEAKVAL 1 else   define TVUSETWEAKVAL 0 endif     See the thread referenced above for idea of how to implement  this without the COUNTER macro.   If we are in a build modethat wants tweakval, and the compiler  supports it, use it if TVUSETWEAKVAL   define TVVal TweakValue FILE, COUNTER, Val   float TweakValue const char file, sizet counter, float origVal  int TweakValue const char file, sizet counter, int origVal   void ReloadChangedTweakableValues  else  dont use it   define TVVal Val   define ReloadChangedTweakableValues  endif  ifdef cplusplus    extern C endif  endif codepre  pthe cpp file is nearly identical except the whole thing is wrapped in if TVUSETWEAKVAL.p  pNow I could set this macro manually, via code or in the build settings but Id prefer to get this thing to automatically enabledisable via detecting the preprocessor command. My guess is that macro is not getting detected when it links the tweakval source code and I dont know what build settings I need to change to fix this issue.p  pThanks.p

Negative 2719 pSo my problem is as follows, I have an AsyncTask Class that is called from a preference file ie. The intent is called from within an xml file. This AsyncTask Class is continuously running as I am doing a real time FFT of the sound within a room and will only be cancelled if I hit the return button. I cant check for keys being pressed as this Class extends AsyncTask and therefore I cant end the thread properly so that it reaches its onCancelled state. The only other way I can think about ending this is to make a standby class which is called from the xml file which in turn calls this class and calls the .canceltrue on the class object.. Any other ideas around this     p

So my question is, how do I create the plist I need and can I manually build my .appp  pSolutionp  pAfter enough tweaking I was finally able to get my java application to bundle and run as a .app.p  precode   ltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltDOCTYPE plist PUBLIC AppleDTD PLIST 1.0EN     httpwww.apple.comDTDsPropertyList1.0.dtdgt ltplist version1.0gt ltdictgt ltkeygtNSPrefPaneIconFileltkeygt ltstringgtNotesClonerIcon.icnsltstringgt ltkeygtJavaltkeygt ltdictgt     ltkeygtJVMVersionltkeygt     ltstringgt1.6ltstringgt     ltkeygtMainClassltkeygt     ltstringgtNotesClonerltstringgt     ltkeygtClassPathltkeygt     ltstringgtJAVAROOTNotesCloner.jarltstringgt     ltkeygtPropertiesltkeygt     ltdictgt         ltkeygtjava.library.pathltkeygt         ltstringgtJAVAROOTltstringgt     ltdictgt ltdictgt ltkeygtPropertiesltkeygt ltdictgt     ltkeygtapple.laf.useScreenMenuBarltkeygt     ltstringgttrueltstringgt ltdictgt ltkeygtCFBundleExecutableltkeygt ltstringgtJavaApplicationStubltstringgt      ltkeygtCFBundleIconFileltkeygt ltstringgtNotesClonerIcon.icnsltstringgt  ltkeygtWorkingDirectoryltkeygt ltstringgtAPPPACKAGEContentsResourcesltstringgt  ltkeygtCFBundleNameltkeygt ltstringgtNotes Cloner Macltstringgt  ltkeygtCFBundleDisplayNameltkeygt ltstringgtNotes Cloner Macltstringgt  ltkeygtNSPrefPaneIconLabelltkeygt ltstringgtNotes Cloner Preferencesltstringgt  ltkeygtCFBundleGetInfoStringltkeygt ltstringgtWritten ByLarry Wells ltstringgt  ltkeygtNSHumanReadableCopyrightltkeygt ltstringgtCopyright  2013, Larry Wells,All Rights Reserved.ltstringgt  ltkeygtCFBundleIdentifierltkeygt ltstringgtcom.LarryWells.NotesClonerMacltstringgt  ltkeygtCFBundleInfoDictionaryVersionltkeygt ltstringgt1.0ltstringgt  ltkeygtCFBundlePackageTypeltkeygt ltstringgtAPPLltstringgt  ltkeygtCFBundleShortVersionStringltkeygt ltstringgt1.0.0ltstringgt  ltkeygtCFBundleSignatureltkeygt ltstringgtltstringgt  ltkeygtCFBundleVersionltkeygt ltstringgt1.0.0ltstringgt ltdictgt ltplistgt codepre

Platform independence which would point to using the standardized codealignas..code is a secondary goal.p  pI am not clear on whether codealignas..code and codeattributealignedcode have some limit which could be below the cache line on the machine. I cant reproduce this any more but while printing addresses I think I did not always get 64 byte aligned addresses with codealignas..code. On the contrary codeposixmemalign..code seemed to always work. Again I cannot reproduce this any more so maybe I was making a mistake.p  pThe second aim is to strongalign a field within a classstructstrong to a cache line. I am doing this to prevent false sharing. I have tried the following waysp  p1 Use the C 11 codealignas..code specifierp  precodetemplatelttypename T, uint64t numeventsgt class RingBuffer    This needs to be aligned to a cache line.   public   ...   private     stdatomicltint64tgt publishersequence      int64t cachedconsumersequence     T events     stdatomicltint64tgt consumersequence alignasCACHELINESIZE  codepre  p2 Use the GCCClang extension codeattribute alignedcodep  precodetemplatelttypename T, uint64t numeventsgt class RingBuffer    This needs to be aligned to a cache line.   public   ...   private     stdatomicltint64tgt publishersequence      int64t cachedconsumersequence     T events     stdatomicltint64tgt consumersequence attribute aligned CACHELINESIZE  codepre  pBoth these methods seem to align codeconsumersequencecode to an address 64 bytes after the beginning of the object so whether codeconsumersequencecode is cache aligned depends on whether the object itself is cache aligned. Here my question is  are there any better ways to do the samep  pstrongEDITstrong The reason alignedalloc did not work on my machine was that I was on eglibc 2.15 Ubuntu 12.04. It worked on a later version of eglibc.p  pFrom the a hrefhttplinux.die.netman3posixmemalignman pagea codeThe function alignedalloc was added to glibc in version 2.16code.p  pThis makes it pretty useless for me since I cannot require such a recent version of eglibcglibc.p

Negative 2719 pI work alot with databases in my java code, e.g. reading from, writing to the database. But I think Im doing it wrong. Im saying this because all my classes that does this, is static. Heres an example of a todo list class that reads and writes to a databasep  precodepublic class TodoListItem        public static String getItem            String item           For the sake of simplicity just imagine that here I call respective database          functions, execute preparedStatements and process the returned ResultSets           return item            public static void setItem String description            Again, imagine that I do preparedStatements and update the database         codepre  pSo as you can see the methods are all static and it just doesnt seem very Object Oriented, it just feels wrong. Somehow I think you should have a bean representing a TodoListItem i.e.p  precodepublic class Item       protected String description      public String getDescription   return this.description       public void setDescription String description  this.description  description    codepre  pThis just feels neater more Object oriented.. But where would I then do the database calls I find it very hard to word this question, but hopefully someone has picked up on what Im saying... p

Negative 2719 pI have one activity in which I load all details of my application by loading different different fragment in my activitys framelayout. p  pIn case of simple flow, when I load A  B  C  D and then coming back in D  C B A is working fine as expected. I always want to move from B to A when back is pressed. p  pBut now in one instance, I have different seq. in which I load A  B  C and then from C I have one button from which I need to load B again. Now when user press back on B, I need to go to A again without going to C. So to achieve that,in onKeyDown event of the parent activity, I checked that if the current fragment is my B fragment then just load A fragment and clear the backstack by popBackStackImmediate as I dont need it anymore. But now when I press back on B then it does load fragment A but the fragment B is not removed. I also tried to check for several answers for removing and adding fragments manually but still no luck. If you have any suggestions for that also then please explain me that process of add and remove or give me some reference site location where I can get details.p  pI tried to figure out the exact working of backstack but in that also, no luck. I dont understand whats going on Why that fragment B is not removed and getting added to A. I have been trying for this from last two days.

Negative 2719 pIm working on wiring up functionality to portions of my database, and one of my first weird issues Ive run into is a method of adding employees into the system.p  pIts not as simple as making an employee model, as my schema is a bit more involved. I structure goes something like this. I have the AspNetUsers table that connected to another table, allusers. The table, allusers, then connects to the tables companies.employees, and employees.employees. p  pEmployee.employees contains all internal employees, and companies.employees contains all external employees. When I add a new employee to the system, if its an external employee, it is spread across 2 tables companies.companies, and companies.employees. The companies table houses the company name, and some other information. The employees table houses all the employees information. p  pIf it is an internal employee that Im adding their information is spread out through 10 different tables, including an employees table, a phone number table, an email table, previous employment, etc. p  pOn my add employee page, Im wanting to basically have a dropdown asking for the company, if they select our company one form is shown, that allows them to enter all the information for an employee, across all the tables. If they select another company, they get the generic form that allows them to enter the employees information.p  pIve been checking around, but havent really seen any easy method of accomplishing this.p

Negative 2719 pSomething I always seem to have difficulty with for some reason is setting up contact forms and the mail scripts and everything...this time for a singlepaged website my own portfolio and thus requiring a dynamic solution without pages refreshes or external links ect. Something which I am not very experienced with.p  pMy site is a hrefhttpwww.samnorris.co.nz relnofollowhttpwww.samnorris.co.nzap  pI have been trying to learn from the website of a hrefhttpwww.alwayscreative.net relnofollowhttpwww.alwayscreative.neta and how they have theirs set up. The form uses a small jQuery plugin on GitHub called FormSentinel to handle the validation side of things  which seems to be working well enough, the submit button is disabled until the form is completed and it prompts for a correct email address, the problem is that nothing happens when the submitTransmit button is clicked.p  pThis is presumably because I have not linked to any PHP script for actually processing the form, as I am unsure where it is actually called from in this scenario. I have a very basic mail.php on the root of my server  but from looking at the AlwaysCreative website the form action links back to the page itself and there is no reference to any PHP or mail scripts in the FormSentinel jquery or documentation or anything for that matter...p  pIm just a bit confused okay, a lot confused as to how or where exactly to establish a link to a PHP processing script for the form without leading to any other external linkspages. With the FormSentinel plugin the page should fade out the form and load in a short Thankyou message in place of the containing fieldset but thats not happening either.p  pstrongJavascript for the formstrongp  precodefunction     var formSentinel       submitting false,     fields [],     rules        required .,       requiredNoWhitespace S,       email S     ,     init functionform        this.fields  form.elements       submitbtn.removeClasssuccess.attrdisabled, disabled       for var i  0 i lt this.fields.length i          if this.fields[i].val              this.fields[i].bindfocus, function              formSentinel.statusListenerform                       this.fields[i].bindblur, function              formSentinel.statusListenerform                             this.fields[i].bindkeydown, keyup, function            var self  this           formSentinel.statusListenerform           if self.hasClassinvalid  self.hasClassvalid              self.bindkeydown, function                formSentinel.fieldListenerthis                                               form.submitfunction           if formSentinel.submitting  false            formSentinel.submitListenerthis           html, body.animatescrollTop form.offset.top, 800                  return false         , fieldListener functionfield    var className  field.className   var classRegExp   S g   var classResult   while classResult  classRegExp.execclassName      var oneClass  classResult[2]     var rule  this.rules[oneClass]     if typeof rule  undefined        if rule.testfield.value          field.addClassinvalid.removeClassvalid              else          field.addClassvalid.removeClassinvalid                , statusListener functionform      var failure  false   for var i  0 i lt this.fields.length i      var className  this.fields[i].className     var classRegExp   S g     var classResult     while classResult  classRegExp.execclassName        var oneClass  classResult[2]       var rule  this.rules[oneClass]       if typeof rule  undefined          if rule.testthis.fields[i].value            failure  true                           if failure  true      submitbtn.removeClasssuccess.attrdisabled, disabled      else      submitbtn.addClasssuccess.removeAttrdisabled    , submitListener functionform      var failure  false     formSentinel.submitting  true   for var i  0 i lt this.fields.length i      var className  this.fields[i].className     var classRegExp   S g     var classResult     while classResult  classRegExp.execclassName        var oneClass  classResult[2]       var rule  this.rules[oneClass]       if typeof rule  undefined          if rule.testthis.fields[i].value            this.fields[i].removeClassvalid.addClassinvalid           failure  true                  else            this.fields[i].removeClassinvalid.addClassvalid                           if failure      msg.fadeOut.remove        cfheader.afterltdiv idmsg styledisplay nonegtYour form was not submitted.

Negative 2719 pIve been working on using OpenSL for a low latency audio app for Android. So far the lowest latency Ive managed to achieve is 200ms on a Samsung Galaxy S5 touchtosound, measured by tapping and recording tap sound followed by app sound. I think I can bring it down to 160ms by improving some internal app logic. Right now there is upto 40ms of delay between the app receiving the touch and getting the callback for that audio. I think this is because Im constantly queueing empty buffers when there is no audio. Is this bad practice I get audio artifacts though when I try approaches that only queue when there is audio for some reason.p  pAnyway, my question is, what is the lowest achievable latency using openSL from touch to audio output on any of the newest Android devices I know it differs from device to device, but I was wondering what is the best device for low latency if there is one, and what is the value of this lowest latency or perhaps the average obtainable minimum for recent devices.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7266298androidsoundapideterministiclowlatencyAndroid sound API deterministic, low latencyap  pThe above link from about a year ago states that it is around the 180ms range. Is this still the lowest possible for OpenSL The recommended answer says that Music Synthesizer for android obtains a total output latency of under 30 ms. But when I run it on a Samsung Galaxy S5 it has a touch to sound latency of 200ms. What is that total output latency referring to Am I missing somethingp  pHow do I decrease the latency furtherp  pThanks for any help you can give mep  pEdit Im doing everything stated here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14842803lowlatencyaudioplaybackonandroidLowlatency audio playback on Androida except NEON or SSE instructions but my processing time is less than the 15 stated there so that shouldnt be a problem.

Negative 2719 pIve been building macros for my work to speed up some of the repetitive tasks we do. It has gotten to the point where some of the macros are getting pretty long, and therefor difficult to editfixadd functionality. Also many of the macros share chunks of code. So i started looking into functions and subs and began separating out chunks of my macros. I got absolutely nowhere before errors started happening to the point that i can not move forwards. p  pI followed some poorly written tutorials to set this stuff up, but most of them didnt work as they said they would.p  pIll jsut put a little bit of code from the start of one macro to see if im on the right track at all...p  precodeSub currentOrdercontrol As IRibbonControl Application.ScreenUpdating  False  code removed from here not neccessary to what we talking about   FocusSheet  ActiveSheet.Name  Call JobNumber  Call PONumberByVal FocusSheet codepre  pand then the two functions that get calledp  precodeFunction JobNumber As String  SheetsMat.

JobNumber function returns, PONumber does not. If i put msgboxes in the functions themselves, i can see that the function is working and getting the correct value from the cell. if i put msgboxes in the MAIN SUB, JobNumber works, PONumber crashes the macro, no matter how it is referenced or where it is in the MAIN SUB.p  pim so confused because these two functions seem to be exactly the same, both just go to another sheet, grab a value from a cell, then drop that value back into the MAIN SUB. Why would one work and the other crash the subp  pIf I cant get these couple of simple 2 lined functions to work as separate functions from the main sub, dunno if ill have a chance with some of the more complicated sections of code in the macro.p  pPLEEEEEEASE HELP MEp

Negative 2719 pQuestion Does anyone have code for a singletable, multicolumn, top N, piecewise distinct, Select queryp  pSuppose you have a new table db..Stuff Like all tables there are dimensions and measures in Stuff. We always want to know What are the range of values for column X in table Stuff Therefore, you write a SELECT DISTINCT for several different columns in table Stuff.p  pIf you write, SELECT DISTINCT for more than one columnp  precodeselect distinct s.colA, s.colB from Stuff as S codepre  pthen you get the combination of colA and colB. Thats nice, but it multiplies your results. It wouuld be better if there was a piecewise distinct. Where you get distinct colA and joinunion it to distinct colA to get a subset representation of whats in table Stuff.p  pIm wondering if anyone has SQL code for this.p

Negative 2719 pI have a directive which is essentially just a search box  with multiple parameters.  In the controller, the search function requires access to a function called codegetOptionscode which is used to get the search box settings.

I cant move codegetOptionscode from the controller because it calls several functions within the directive.p  pThanks.p

Negative 2719 pI have written a VB.NET server that communicates with a silverlight client and a iOS client using CocoaAsyncSocket. Im sending and receiving JSON data, and pdf documents encoded as base64 strings. When receiving encoded pdf documents on the client side I have some performance issues, it was easily fixed in the silverlight client by adjusting the ReceiveBufferSize, and setting the SendBufferSize on the server both currently set to 65536. But on iOS client I cant find any where to set the buffer size. Receiving a document about 6MB in silverlight takes 34 sec, and on iOS 2530 sec.p

Negative 2719 pFirst of all, lets get one thing straight, while im sure its not the ONLY solution to sql injections, PREPARED STATEMENTS ARE BETTER and MORE SECURE... thats granted. p  pSo lets not debate it anymore, as I just needed to explore the escaping options and target the user inputs rather than the statement.. p  pa bit of back story  I have a huge application w lots of basic SQL statements which i need to make safer in a short period of time. Converting all statements to PDO is a monster of a task which requires resources not available to this situation. p  pBut good thing is that theres a hook in the application where ALL incoming GETPOST passes through a function before making available as plain variable in the scripts...  eg.globalizePOST p  pSo im looking to target that function instead and focus on cleaning user input ... p  pI pretty much got a good grasp of SQL injection techniques, and basically much of its concept, such as 1 Whenever there is user input involved in a statement, thats when the attacker has an opportunity 2 The main mission is to break your statements quoting by simple single or double quotes as string, or character codes, in the attackers input..  3 Escaping is good at preventing SQL injections except for that situation when the DATABASE character encoding is able to ready multibyte representations of those nasty illegal strings and the script based escaping misses it.p  pBased on the above premise, what ifp  p1 All my SQL Statements follow a standard where user input is quoted using single quotes ALWAYS, therefore there is no guess work for me anymore on what type of quote i need to escape single quotesp  p2 all user inputs POST  GET go through a function eg. globalize  that basically addslashes and globalizes each variable p  p3 This is an intranet application and the scripts can be made aware of the database encoding support.p  pQUESTION What are the threats currently available in the above situation and how can we handle themp  p...i personally was looking into simply adding routines to the globalize function similar to mysqlrealescapestring  .. or go as far as tweaking the SQL statements to use mysqlrealescapestring as that is a lot easierfaster to do than programming statements on each sql query.. p  pPS Of course this script may never be as secure as prepared statements, but i just need to make it hard enough for most attackers not looking to 100 bullet proof it as it is not that worth it p
Negative 2719 pIve looked at this for a few hours now and cant figure out whats missing. Ive tried retooling the computed observable into a pureComputed, but it didnt help. Ive looked at adding an .extendnotify always to the end per a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22372330knockoutjsforcingacomputedobservabletorecomputeKnockoutJS Forcing A Computed Observable to ReComputea, but didnt help.

Negative 2719 pI search for some help creating a web Flex application using BlazeDS and Java server with dynamic BlazeDS endpoint configuration.p  pFirst, I will try to explain my current situation.p  pI have a Flex 3.2 application that provides GUI of the application. From the ActionScript I call Java methods using BlazeDS. To access the BlazeDS I use a Config class that provides the endpoint as shown below it is a constructorp  precodepublic function Config void       if serviceUrl  null          try              var browser IBrowserManager  BrowserManager.getInstance             browser.init             var url String  browser.url              var host String  mx.utils.URLUtil.getServerNameurl             var port uint  mx.utils.URLUtil.getPorturl             var parts Array  url.split             if parts[2]                    url  DEFAULTURL                 Alert.showUnable to determine server location, using default URL   DEFAULTURL, Connection error                          else                  url  parts[0]    parts[2]    parts[3]  messagebrokeramf                           serviceUrl  url          catch e Error               Alert.showException while trying to determine server location, using default URL   DEFAULTURL, Connection exception             serviceUrl  DEFAULTURL                 codepre  pThe idea of the class is to determine the endpoint from the request URL. I use a Delegate class to call the remote methods using BlazeDS like the followingp  precode import com.adobe.cairngorm.business.ServiceLocator  import mx.rpc.IResponder import mx.rpc.remoting.RemoteObject  public class AbstractRemoteDelegate      public function AbstractRemoteDelegateresponderIResponder,serviceNameString               responderresponder         locatorServiceLocator.getInstance         servicelocator.getRemoteObjectserviceName         service.showBusyCursortrue         service.endpoint  Config.instance.serviceUrl            private var responderIResponder     private var locatorServiceLocator     private var serviceRemoteObject      protected function sendoperationNameString,... argsArray  void                     service.getOperationoperationName.send.applyservice.getOperationoperationName,args.addResponderresponder         codepre  pThis approach actually works fine. However, I got across a situation where I cant use dynamically determined URL. In such a situation, I need a hardcoded URL in the Config.as file. And this is the problem. When trying to deploy the application to another server, I always need to rebuild the application with a new URL configuration in the ActionScript class Config.p  pTherefore I search for a way to define a static configuration for the Flex application to connect to a BlazeDS server. And the way to change such configuration without rebuilding the application so I can give the customer his own way to reconfigure and move the Flex application.p  pI thought about using a configuration file, but Flex runs on the client side and there is no configuration file I thought about using database configuration, but I dont have any database on the client sidep  pTo sum up, I am looking for a way, how to get BlazeDS URL from a configuration to be able to change it without rebuilding the whole app.p  pThanks for any useful suggestions.p  pEDIT Revised the question to be more actual. I improved the way to determine the URL dynamically from the request URL, so it works now even for proxy server. However, my curiosity persists for the configuration of flex without rebuilding.p

Negative 2719 pIm having a lot of difficulty with this, Ive been looking around everywhere and while many people seem to have a similar problem, none of the fixes have worked.  Ive disabled turbolinks, and I have no other javascript or css styles running.p  pIm using Rails 4.1, Ruby 2.0.0 and foundationrails 5.4.3.p  pthe css styling itself seems to work okay, buttons show up as buttons, and the topbar layout and look is as expected, but dropdown menus do not work.  Ive been messing with this for so long that I eventually just created a brand new, completely empty test app with basic scaffolding to test it and still dropdowns still will not work.p  pIve tried a few things including moving function document.foundation  in the application.js file into a  tag in application.html, moving the javascript tags around to several locations in application.html, and several variations of the classes in the menu li and  tags.p  pSymptomsp  pTesting on Chromep  pDropdowns are completely unresponsive, when screen is scaled down, menu button doesnt work at all.p  pTesting on FirefoxIEp  pDropdowns will actually drop down if they are clicked, but not on hover.  Nested dropdowns still not working, and when I click on anything inside the dropdown it dissapears.  When the screen is scaled down the menu button does not work at all.p  phere is what Ive donep  precoderails new foundationtest rails g scaffold item nametext descriptiontext skipstylesheets rake dbmigrate codepre  pI then added foundationrails to, and removed turbolinks from, my gemfile and ranp  precodebundle rails g foundationinstall codepre  pI accepted all the defaults, then went into the application.js file and removed  require turbolinks from it.p  pas it stands now, this is what I have.p  papplication.htmlp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml langengt   ltheadgt     ltmeta charsetutf8 gt     ltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth, initialscale1.0 gt      lttitlegtlt contentfortitle  yieldtitle  foundationrails gtlttitlegt      lt stylesheetlinktag    application gt     lt javascriptincludetag vendormodernizr gt     lt csrfmetatags gt   ltheadgt    ltbodygt     ltnav classtopbargt       ltul classtitleareagt         lt Title Area gt         ltli classnamegt           lth1gtlta hrefgtTop Bar Title ltagtlth1gt         ltligt         lt Remove the class menuicon to get rid of menu icon.

Negative 2719 pI am trying to use the categories to make some sort of taxonomy picker. I have a site, which Im running locally for event planning I have 6 categories with sub categories within them. For example if someone is looking for a band, they go into the band category and then it displays all the posts within that category.p  pI want to use the sub categories to narrow the search down so people searching for bands but want classical will find just those posts.  But I want to do it by asking them a question, like What sort of band are you looking for then they select from a drop down of sub categories for the bands. They will do this for each category, make a selection or none so that it gives them a list of only what they are looking for.p  pMaybe after each selection, it adds that category into an array which is then used for a wp post queryp

Negative 2719 pI have a UITableView and I have set the datasource for the table using a List.I know the size of the list initially and have set the number of cells of the table as same as the list length.I am fetching the data for the table in background meaning the list data changes dynamically even when the table is being displayed. When there is fast swipe from the user,the tableview displays empty cells for some data which is still being fetched.p  pIssue When I reach the end of the tableview and when the tableview is still displaying empty cells,and I try to scroll up the cell is redrawn from bottom showing the data meaning effectively the data is refreshed from the bottom of the tableview.p  pWhat I tried I tried reloading the tableview,reloading the cells as soon as I get the data from backend,but still this issue persists.I tried reloading the tableview using InvokeOnMainThread,but still this problem persists.p  pWhat I think is happening The data fetching is completed in background when the tableview is displaying empty cells and when I do scroll up again the cells are repainted to display the data.I am using reusable cells in my tableview.p  pIs there any way to reload the cells as soon I get the data and update the cells.That is,when the tableview is displaying empty cells and as soon as data fetching is complete,reload the data in the tableview.p

Negative 2719 pI am not sure if there is an answer for that, although this looks like a REALLY simple question. p  pI am using a vba code to open a file in a Sharepoint, however, as I cannot use the LenDir to check if the file really exists, I used a code which I found in a forum but this code does not work the way I thought it would. p  pWhat I needed was a code to look for several files in the Sharepoint and each file need to have the current date For example If we are in July 2014, the file must be named as NameJuly2014, not NameJune2014 or May2014. Since the file with the current date might not exist, then it would be entered the message Not Updated in a specific cell in the workbook I am using and the macro would continue to run. The code works well, but it stops every time to show a message that the file does not exists. This message appears everytime the macro tries to open a file that does not exist. I needed to skip this warning and let the code run. I thought this code would skip the warning using On Error GoTo and this would be the way to show that a file exists, but its not working. Can anyone take a lookp  pCan I avoid somehow the message The internet address ... is not validp  pReally sorry if I wasnt clear enough because of my English and sorry if this question has already been answered in another post.p  pThis is what the code looks likep  precodeOpen the file and checks if the name of the file opened is different from the       previous file opened On Error Resume Next Application.Workbooks.Open fileName newBook  ActiveWorkbook.Name If originalBook  newBook Then     [the file does not exist, do something] Else     [the file exists, do something else] End If On Error Goto  codepre

REBASE codep  pwhen i write codegit statuscode it says its not a repository.p  pWell i wouldnt care that much about failed rebase BUT, i noticed that all of my source files turned to binary files and that means, my strongunpushedstrong commits are LOST, unless you guys can help me recover it.p  pI wanted to rebase the branch and push it.... this is frustrating.p  pEDIT 1p  pcode.gitcode directory is in the repository directory codesomepathtoreporeponame.gitcode as it should be. The PC crashed at the point when branch2 commits were being reapplied. It means that branch1 commits were already applied to the branch2, the only thing left, was to finish applying branch2 commits. And it crashed after like 10 or 20 commits were applied.p  pI have now compared the .git direcotries of a cloned repo and the one which crashed.p  pCloned repo had these foldersbr hooksbr infobr logsbr objectsbr refsbr And these filesbr configbr descriptionbr HEADbr indexbr packedrefsp  pThe crashed one has an extra folder named coderebaseapplycode, also extra filesbr COMMITEDITMSGbr FETCHHEADbr ORIGHEADp  pEverything else seems to match.

Negative 2719 pFor the previous couple of years, I have developed user interfaces using MFC. The main reason being, the libraries used to interface with the cameras being used are only available in C. Generally 60 of project time has been spent trying to build UIs with clunky MFC... p  pLately, I have been looking into mixedmode programming with the intention of developing interfaces and high level functions in C. Whilst mixing this with the native C code required for hardware communication.p  pOne component I would like to get some advice about, is the presentation of the camera data. From what I have read, the data would need to be provided to the managed UI code by the native code by means of some form of callback and marshalling the data into a form that the managed code can draw on a control video display. From what I know of marshalling, it can be a time expensive procedure. So that leads me to the question, how safe if at all possible, is it to provide the unmanaged code a handle to a control on which the video is to be presented, and have the unmanaged code section handle the drawingp

Negative 2719 pIm a fairly new developer and Ive encountered my first project where it will be important to be able to store certain fields encrypted within the database.p  pIm on the most current version of RubyRails, hosted on Heroku and using Git for source control. I installed the symmetricencryption gem and SORT of have it working. But, when it comes to security, I know sort of doesnt cut it.p  pSo, I set up the env variable with a key inside Heroku and have created a column in my database called codeencryptedaccesscodecode. When I submit a form, passing an codeaccesscodecode parameter, it stores an encrypted version inside the codeencryptedaccesscodecode column. If I call the code.decryptcode method on that string, the method properly decrypts it and returns the original value. That seems, by what I can tell, to all be working correctly.p  pThe problem is that I am still able to call codeMyModel.accesscodecode, both in console and in the view, and it returns the unencrypted value. That column is no longer present in my database but its still letting me call it  not good and Im not sure where I went wrong. Im sure it has something to do with symmetricencryption and my not understanding it fully, but I havent been able to find a truly comprehensive guide on getting it up and running. Using the creators site I used his example to add the bits I needed in my model but I must be missing something. Any help would be super, super appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 2719 pHi i would like to use bootstrap themes inside some websites that i am developing, however after looking at the documentation and searching online i have found it somewhat troubling that there is no explicit how to guide start to finish with using bootstrap themes, a hrefhttpstartbootstrap.comtemplatecategoriesall relnofollowlike found herea. Furthermore i would like to download multiple themes into my project directory, extract them into the appropriate folders e.g. css,img,js,ect... and utilize them inside of my html files like sop  precodeltdiv classcustomizedbootstrapitemgtmyItemltdivgt codepre  pI am having a bit of trouble trying to do this because it seems there is no universality among the themese.g. each one may vary in how they work and i dont want to hack together some dirty code if there is a proper way of doing it. So my question is , is there a proper way of adding themes into your existing project purely for aesthetics and customizing them by exchanging the appearance between one them and other themes, and if so how  Can you guys point me towards some tutorials I need to know more about how linking these js and css files will affect other aspects of the themes, and how the html tags can be used properly in a uniform way across many themes, as i wont settle likely on just one theme.p  peditp  pAfter trying some of the suggestions i managed to figure out at least some of the problems i was having by including the css style of the specific theme that i want to use as a stylesheet link in the head section of the html page that i want to apply it to, which seems pretty straight forward anyway. However im still a little bit perplexed on how to get all of those cool elements that i see in the themes, especially the dashboard themes into my custom html page. A good example of a theme that i am looking at is a hrefhttpalmsaeedstudio.comAdminLTE relnofollowfound herea. If you guys could give me a bit of insight on how to get those elements on the page i.e. dashboards, panels, UI elements etc... that would be great. I may be mistaken but i dont think they are normal bootstrap classes, although im fairly new to bootstrap so im not 100 sure on that.p
Negative 2719 pI tried to figure this out myself but I cant. Im stuck at a strange problem.p  pI have a Java Program with multiple classes and forms I use Intellij and the build in GUICreator.

Negative 2719 pI am attempting to build a web based image viewer which will display each page of a multipage tiff file to users.  The tiff files consists of between 1 and 10 pages and a typical 5 page file is quite large, arround 15MB.  The images are stored on a separate server from where the web application will be hosted. Unfortunately the hosted images cannot be changed or compressed.p  pWhat I had thought to do was retrieve the image from the back end and in the webapp tier perform some form of compressionresizing on the image before sending to the users web browser but was unsure if this was likely to help any as the processing time to complete this compression may negate any gains that the smaller file transferring to the users browser would bring.p  pIt seams there is not much information about this type of thing on the web and I really jsut wanted opinions for best practice  design for doing this.p  pThanks. p

What am i doing wrong here is the code p  precodeimport java.util.Scanner import objectdraw. import java.awt. import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit  public class RicochetOne extends WindowController          private static final int CANVASWIDTH400         private static final int CANVASHEIGHT600          public static void mainString [] args                          Scanner scnr  new ScannerSystem.in                 System.out.printlnEnter size of box in pixels                  int boxSize  scnr.nextInt                 System.out.printlnEnter number of crossings                  int Crossings  scnr.nextInt                 System.out.printlnEnter pixel Speed                  int pixelSpeed  scnr.nextInt scnr.close                 RicochetOne ricochet  new RicochetOne                 ricochet.startControllerCANVASWIDTH, CANVASHEIGHT                 ricochet.beginboxSize, Crossings, pixelSpeed                 ifboxSize lt 0                                          System.exit1                                    private FilledRect sq1         public void beginint boxSize, int Crossings, int pixelSpeed                   int x  CANVASWIDTH  2  boxSize  2         int y  CANVASHEIGHT  2  boxSize  2         int CanvasEnd  CANVASWIDTH  boxSize         canvas.clear         sq1  new FilledRectx, y, boxSize, boxSize, canvas         sq1.setColorColor.BLUE         boolean goingRight  true         boolean crossMid  false         Text textOne  new TextCrossings, 0, 0, canvas                 while pixelSpeed gt 0 ampamp Crossings gt 0                      try                              TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep50                          catch InterruptedException e              ifpixelSpeed gt 0 ampamp x lt CanvasEnd  1 ampamp goingRight                              if CanvasEnd x lt pixelSpeed                                      sq1.moveCanvasEnd  x, 0                  x  CanvasEnd  x                                  else                                      x  pixelSpeed                     sq1.movepixelSpeed, 0                                            else                               if goingRight                                      crossMid  false                                  goingRight  false                 if x lt pixelSpeed                                      sq1.movex, 0                     x  x                                  else                                                      sq1.movepixelSpeed, 0                     x  pixelSpeed                                  if x  0                                       crossMid  false                     goingRight  true                                           if x  boxSize  2 gt CANVASWIDTH  2 ampamp goingRight ampamp     crossMid                              crossMid  true                 Crossings  Crossings 1                 textOne.setTextCrossings                          else if x  boxSize  2 lt CANVASWIDTH  2 ampamp crossMid ampamp     goingRight                              crossMid  true                 Crossings  Crossings 1                 textOne.setTextCrossings                                 while pixelSpeed lt 0 ampamp Crossings gt 0                       try                              TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep50                          catch InterruptedException e              ifpixelSpeed lt 0 ampamp x gt 0 ampamp goingRight                              x  pixelSpeed                 sq1.movepixelSpeed, 0                          else                               if goingRight                                      crossMid  false                                  goingRight  false                 sq1.movepixelSpeed, 0                 x  pixelSpeed                  if x gt CanvasEnd                                       crossMid  false                     goingRight  true                                           if x  boxSize  2 gt CANVASWIDTH  2 ampamp goingRight ampamp crossMid                              crossMid  true                 Crossings  Crossings 1                 textOne.setTextCrossings                          else if x  boxSize  2 lt CANVASWIDTH  2 ampamp crossMid ampamp goingRight                              crossMid  true                 Crossings  Crossings 1                 textOne.setTextCrossings                                if pixelSpeed  0                      x  CANVASWIDTH  2  boxSize  2                codepre
Negative 2719 pAfter searching for a long time, Im going to post this question. p  pHere, I am going to build an application in android which will have codeTwiliocode Voice for making outbound calls and receiving incoming calls to  android Application. Ive successfully implemented the process of outgoing calls and its working fine too. But When someone calls from traditional phone to one of codeTwiliocode powered phone number, codeTwiliocode receive the incoming connection through codeTwiliocode device and send Asynchronous HTTP request to voice URL configured for that particular number and execute the expected Twiml Instructions. But here, the question is how to integrate this functionality of receiving incoming calls or connections to codeTwiliocode number into my android application and record the accepted calls, then how my application will distinguish that call is receiving on a particular number.p

Negative 2719 pIve added a new build system in Sublime Text 2, which runs a mocha test suite for me doing a simple make test.  However, I do not want this to be my active build system because I already have an active JSHint build system which I want to stay in place.  p  pInstead, what I simply want to do is to add a new menu item under the Tools menu which will run my mocha test suites. In other words, ToolsBuild should run my active JSHint build system, and only by selecting ToolsMocha where Mocha is a new menu item I add should I run my mocha test suite.p  pThis should be simple but Ive spent hours on what should be a simple task so hopefully someone can point out how to do this.p

Negative 2719 pI ran across some code using codeexitcode to abort process a request as soon as an error was encountered. Im not a PHP expert, but my immediate reaction, knowing FastCGI at a high level, is that would exit the process and is generally a bad idea. This wasnt the case with Nginx and my current PHP, but with ancient Apache versions, a hrefhttpwww.fastcgi.comomarchivemailarchive0224.html relnofollowthis was a problema. PHPs documentation on FastCGI was a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenbook.fpm.php relnofollowpretty sparsea, but it did mention codefastcgifinishrequestcode which looks like a graceful way to finish the request.p  pThe documentation for codeexitcode is unclear on whether it has any performance implications for FastCGI, but there is the subtle distinction that it exists the emscriptem, not the process. The documentation for a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenfunction.header.php relnofollowcodeheadercodea actually uses codeexitcode, and I found the pattern in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3553698phpshouldicallexitaftercallinglocationheaderseverala a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2747791whyihavetocallexitafterredirectionthroughheaderlocationinphpStack Overflowa a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8665985phputilizingexitordieafterheaderlocation]postsa, but the justification was so you dont send a body, not if you dont emit a body after the header, the body will be empty and the redirect will work as expected.p  pI also found a hrefhttpserverfault.comquestions84962phpviafastcgiterminatedbycallingexitconflicting answersa on whether or not it causes problems. That, and a hrefhttpwiki.dreamhost.comFastCGINoExits relnofollowDreamhost recommends against codeexitcode when using FastCGIa though their examples in Perl. The one place it definitely causes problems is unit testing.p  pSo my question whats the best practice for using codeexitcode in PHP web pages Is codefastcgifinishrequestcode a better choice Would restructuring the control flow be better Are the problems people reported Apachespecific Or is this just another version of are multiple codereturnscode bad programming practicep

Negative 2719 pIm creating an ios IPad app that has a UITabBar control positioned at the bottom with 3 MenuItems in it.  Normally, when I rotate the device, the tabbar will remain at the bottom in landscape.  Id like to have the TabBar rotate to the left side in Landscape mode, and become a vertical representation.  I dont want to create a UIView with buttons if possible, because Id like the same object to manage both, and I like the convenience of the normal TabBar.p  pMy Plan was to detect the device position, and use a UITransform to rotate the TabBar 90 degrees when in landscape.  Lets ignore the icon and text rotation inside for now, and just focus on the overall TabBar itself.p  pRotation works, except that it leaves the vertical TabBar in the bottom center of the screen looking very out of place.  The next task was to constrain it to the left wall.  Normally I am using 3 constraints to hold the TabBar to the LeftBottomRight sides.  Im having a lot of trouble finding the right constraints to keep it on the left side correctly.  p  pOne main problem is that once the transform is done, height and width attributes are reversed or also transformed on the tabbar.  So high makes it wider on the screen, and width makes it taller.  Using topbottom constraints along with a height of 49 is what is seemingly required, except the topbottom height combo causes a constraint conflict.  p  pIm attaching my current constraint logic which is reasonably working, yet I cant figure out why I need to hardcode these values as shown.  This was the only way to get the visual output on the left side.  Im wondering if there is a cleaner way to do this, perhaps without hardcoded values in there for the constants.p  pIm also not sure how Ill end up rotating the texticons as a next step.p  pAttached also are how it currently appears.  It is green to illustrate clearly but will ultimately be transparent, so the cutoff at the top of landscape wont be a problem.p  precode void adjustViewsForOrientationUIInterfaceOrientation

Negative 2719 pTriangles are surfaces with a very simple coderaytrianglecode intersection algorithm which can be done with a few operations. They are often used as primitives for raytracing applications for this reason  a mesh is, for example, approximated by a collection of triangles. The problem is, the more detailed the approximation, the more triangles you need, which means more tests. If your object is a perfect sphere, then using triangles might not be a good idea, since there is an O1 algorithm that can test directly for coderayspherecode intersections with few operations.p  pMy question is what other surfaces have that property of having a faster coderaysurfacecode intersection than the triangularization approach Is there any mathematical structureobject that allows us to approximate the surface of an arbitrary 3D object and check for its intersection in O1p

Negative 2719 pWe have a very odd issue.  A new dev server win 2008r2 Standard has been built.  The team uses Dreamweaver CS5.5 to push files to environments.   For some reason .js and .css files get pushed to dev 100 they are there instantly.  we can see then land in another RDP session  but are not accessible for around 78 seconds.  The browser does not error of course.  if its a .css file they styles are all dropped.   p  pWe have QA and internalProdcution server which we also push code to.  These are almost identical, they are win 2008r2 Enterprise.  This issue does not occur. When the files are pushed they are immediacy browsable.  p  pIf we open to explorer windows one local, one the application dir of the new dev server  make a chamge and copypaste the file using explorer no issue occurs  This makes me think Dreamweaver is the issue, but why does it not occue pushing to QA or intProd    The site propertiessetup in DW has been tripple checked, they are the same.p  pWhat could this be, its very annoying p

Negative 2719 pWhenever I look at Python networking examples, addresses for a server are always formatted like thisp  precodeHOST   PORT  1776 ADDR  HOST, PORT codepre  pDoes this format benefit anyone in anyway Up until this point, Ive skipped the codeHOSTcode and codePORTcode variables and just set them directly in the codeADDRcode variable, as I was thinking that making extra variables is just using up resources and adding unnecessary weight to the program albeit not much....

Negative 2719 pI have a fourlevel navigation menu that works with hover states for the first three levels and an onclick function to show the fourth level. In Safari on OS X, emsometimesem when I open a fourth level menu and then move my mouse off of the menu area, rather than disappearing, the menu lingers on the screen, but is not clickable it seems to go away after scrolling or clicking around elsewhere on the screen. However, this does not happen every time, and I havent figured out how to consistently make it happen, it seems random to me. This does not happen in any other browser, including Safari on Windows.p  pI made a a hrefhttprecordit.co0jiWubSVOD relnofollowrecordita of the menu. In the beginning of the video you can see how the hover menu is supposed to work. Hovering over the first level items opens the second level below it. Hovering over a second level item opens a third level menu to the right. The third menu has a plus icon, which opens the fourth level menu on click p  pAt 128 you can see the bug.p  pIm not sure if its the onclick functionality of the plusminus icons that is causing the bug, but here are the functions for opening and closing the fourth level menusp  precodefunction expandNavMenuicon      var li  icon.parent.parent.parent     li.addClassactive     var subMenu  li.findul     subMenu.cssdisplay, block       swap plus sign for minus sign     var minus  li.find.minusicon     icon.parent.hide     minus.cssdisplay, inlineblock       resize boxes     var rightBox  li.parent     rightBox.heightauto     var leftBox  rightBox.parent.parent     leftBox.heightauto      resizeBoxesleftBox, rightBox   function closeNavMenuicon      var li  icon.parent.parent.parent     li.removeClassactive     var subMenu  li.findul     subMenu.cssdisplay, none       swap plus sign for minus sign     var plus  li.find.plusicon     icon.parent.hide     plus.cssdisplay, inlineblock      resize boxes     var rightBox  li.parent     rightBox.heightauto     var leftBox  rightBox.parent.parent     leftBox.heightauto      resizeBoxesleftBox, rightBox  codepre  pHas anyone seen this issue in Safari before Why is this happeningp  pYou can see my site a hrefhttpec254880176.compute1.amazonaws.com relnofollowherea if you want to mess around with the menu.p

Negative 2719 pI have created tabs in my android application by using the codeandroid.support.v4.app.Fragmentcode and codeFragmentStatePagerAdaptercode.

It works, but as I have explained this page pops up when I enter the homescreen, which is not what I want. p
