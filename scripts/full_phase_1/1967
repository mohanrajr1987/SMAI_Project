Positive 1967 pI have n Endpoints behind an AWS Elastic Load Balancer, and I want to make a REST Call to everyone of those machines. If I make this call directly to the ELB, it will call just one of the machines. So my question is there a way yo make it Maybe a specific AWS ELB Api that I can use, or some configuration I dont know. Before you suggest I can not change the REST to anything else, I have no control over the application.p

Positive 1967 pIn my WPF application I have a codeTabControlcode with three codeTabItemscode. Each codeTabItemcode has a codeItemsControlcode inside which codeItemsSourcecode is bound to an codeObservableCollectioncode in a Viewmodel. If I open the first and second codeTabItemcode, CPU usage is lt10. But when I open my third codeTabitemcode the CPU usage increases up to 70 and I dont know why. p  pMy first thought was, that data binding causes this. So i removed any binding from this codeTabItemcode. But even if the third codeTabItemcode has no content nor code which is called, the CPU usage is still high.

It sends you there whenever you beat a level and press continue, and whenever you press continue or new game at the main menu screen. Theres an object that only instantiates on a node when the level is locked. I had it working before so when youd complete level 1, the object wouldnt instantiate on the level 2 node indicating that it was unlocked, and when you beat level 2, the object wouldnt instantiate on the level 3 node again, indicating it was unlocked. I dont know what I did to it, but now it doesnt working and Ive been stuck on this forever. Any helpp  pAnother note, pressing new game clears the progress so only level 1 should be unlocked. Usually if I complete level 1, I could stop running the game, run it again from the main menu scene, and I would have the option to press continue at the main menu screen to send me to the world select screen with level 1 and 2 both unlocked. But now since for whatever reason, beating level one sends me back to the world select without taking away the object from the level 2 node, the continue prompt at the main menu scene never shows up to me anymore.p  pThere are no compiler errors.p

Negative 1967 pFor whatever reason, I have a lot of clients that have existing data thats stored in spreadsheets. Often there are hundreds, if not thousands of items in each spreadsheet, and asking the client to manually enter them through a website or heaven forbid importing them that way myself is out of the question. Typically, this data doesnt simply map spreadsheet column to database column. That would be too easy. Often, the data needs to be manipulated before going into the database data needs to be split by commas, etc or the data needs to be spread out across multiple tables. Or both.p  pIm asking this question, not because I dont know of a multitude of ways to do it, but because I havent settled on a way that doesnt feel like it takes more work than it should.

Negative 1967 pI have a calculated measure in Analysis Services that returns the average daily revenue for a location based on their last three periods.  Periods are location defined lengths of time, so one location may close their periods monthly, and another may close their periods quarterly.p  pTo return the average daily revenue I have a factPeriods table that returns the revenue for a period, and the number of days that contribute to the period.  The following MDX returns the correct values at the location level, [Measures].[Days In AR Charges]  [Measures].[Days In AR Days].p  pThe  problem is when I roll up to higher levels, say I want to return the average daily revenue by state, the calculation is incorrect because it first aggregates the days contributing to the periods, then divides.  I want the averaging to happen at the lowest level first, then to sum the results of the daily average revenue.

My total should be 120 day.  Instead, it would return 40day.  Here is what happens at the calculation level.p  pI would like the formula to be in pseudocode SUM[Measures].[Days In AR Charges]  [Measures].[Days In AR Days]p  pbut it is actually giving me SUM[Measures].[Days In AR Charges]  SUM[Measures].[Days In AR Days]p  pCan anyone help me determine the appropriate formula to make this work as desired  It should end up being 100day  20day, not 4800120 days.

Negative 1967 pI am new to the concept of MVC and multitiered web architecture.  I developing a PHP application and am using one of the available MVC frameworks.  My question is as followsp  pFrom what I understand, MVC in and of itself is not considered a multitier architecture. I can understand how using MVC alone is a step up from taking an unstructured approach, but I was contemplating how a simple 3tier architecture would fit in  Would MVC reside in the presentation layer What are the merits of adding a tiered approach  From what I gather, with MVC alone there are no explicit data objects responsible for retrieving data from the database and this is usually stuffed into the model.  Likewise the business logic, which in a 3tiered architecture would reside in a businesslayer or whatever you want to call it, can be stuffed into the controller.  p  pIs my understanding somewhat correct  I know I asked a lot of questions, but I would like to hear you discuss how you incorporated an ntier architecture into your MVC framework PHP or otherwise as I assume that the two are not mutually exclusive.

Negative 1967 pI work on a small scale application about 5000 users, but we do maintain some important user preference data. Whenever we release an upgrade we check if there are users online we do it after hours and usually there are none and then just put an outage page and apply the new build both UI and DB changes. It all takes about half and hour and is usually pain free.p  pBut I always wonder how sites like Amazon or Ebay or Google push upgrades to production. I know its phased out over time and servers etc, but thousands of users are logged in at any time and are continuously updating data. I know that there is load balancing such that if one server is taken down, the users session is seamlessly transferred to another machine, and similar database options, but it still seems overwhelming to keep everything running although with fewer servers but still upgrade UI , DB and functionality smoothly.p  pAre there specific guidelines and strategies somewhere about deployment for large websites Any whitepapers What are the best practices in that area p  pEDIT I said half an hour, but that includes the time from which we take the app down, to the time we get it back up. This includes UI and functionality smoke tests, DB Consistency checks and a small load test. The time to actually deploy is infact less than two minutes.p

Negative 1967 pIm having some trouble understanding PHPs sessions. First off I am saving session data in a database, I used PHPs codesessionsetsavehandlercode function to define that.p  pThe way I understand when PHP saves the session data to the DB is like sop  pIf I define some session variables then output some text to the users browser, I believe the session data is not saved to the DB until after the text is output. Please look at this bit of codep  precodeSESSION[username]  username   check if session variable set ifSESSION[username]  username  dieerror...  codepre  pIn the code the if statement returns false so codediecode never occurs. Also PHP does not write the session data to the DB until after the if statement. What I dont understand is if the session data is not written to the DB yet, how is PHP comparing codeSESSION[username]code to codeusernamecode Is codeSESSION[username]code stored in server memory until the end of the script when session data is written to the DBp  pThank you for your time.p

Negative 1967 pI have a cross platform C application that is broken into several shared libraries and loads additional functionality from plugin shared libraries.  The plugin libraries are supposed to be self contained and function by themselves, without knowledge of or dependency on the calling application.  p  pOne of the plugins contains copied code from the main application, so contains symbol names that are duplicate to those in the engine.  Yes I know thats generally a nono, but at the time the plugin was written the engine was a monolithic binary and couldnt share libraries.  On Windows, everything runs fine.  On Linux we were getting segfaults.  By looking at the stack trace of the error, it was occurring in the plugin when calling functions in the duplicate class name.  It appeared to be a result of the engine and plugin having slightly different versions of the shared code some class functionality was commented out in the plugin.  It was as if the plugin was getting its symbols runtime linked to the engines instead of its own.  We fixed the issue by changing the codedlopencodes parameters to be codedlopenpFilepath, RTLDLAZY  RTLDLOCALcode.p  pBut when we rewrote the engine to be split into shared libraries for the eventual purpose of reuse in the plugins, we get the segfault error again.  And looking at the stack trace, it goes from the engine  plugin  engine.p  pIs there a way to specify for the runtime linker to not map symbols of the plugin to the engine especially if they are defined in the pluginp  pThanks Mattp  phr Edited 2009123  p  pI first tried to wrap the plugins code in its own namespace.  That didnt work because it is statically linked to a library that is also linked to the engine.  The versions of the static library are different, so segfaultp  pThen I changed the build of the engine and its libraries to be statically linked.  And when I run it, I no longer have the issue.  So it appears it was a result of having the shared library symbols exported and then being dynamically relocated into the plugin when it was opened.  But when all of the engines code is in a single executable, it doesnt export its symbols so it doesnt try to relocate the plugins symbols into the engine.p  pI still have an issue though, as there is a parallelized version of the program using OpenMPI and that still gets the segfault.  It appears in that its still exporting the engines symbols and relocating the plugins.  That might have to do with how OpenMPI executes the application.p  pAre there any linker flags that could be used on the plugin shared library that would tell it not to dynamically relocate the symbols at runtime  Or to hide its symbols so they dont get relocated  Ive tried codescode Omit all symbol information but that apparently didnt change the dynamic symbols checked using codenm D ltplugingtcode.p

Ive moreorless got it working laying out the nodes, but one problem Ive found is that it begins gets noticeably slow to rendernavigate its in a scroll viewer when the number of nodes gets larger than about 30. Since an average game of go consists of around 200 moves not to mention other branches that the player might fork onto, this is going to be a fairly big problem in any realistic game.p  pCurrently, Im using individual user controls for the game nodes each being an ellipse with a shadow bitmap effect on it and some text annotation and simple lines for the arcs in the tree, all of which are positioned absolutely in a canvas.p  pThe layout algorithm isnt such a problem since this only has to be executed when a new branch is created otherwise the node can be added directly beneath its parent, so no other nodes need to be relocated. The main problem is simply that any kind of manipulation of this canvas and its elements is very slow, presumably just due to the number of children it has. It obviously gets slower as the width and complexity of the tree increases, since there are more arcs as well as nodes.p  pstrongMy questionstrong Whats the proper way to about drawing a largecomplex structure like this in such a way that it doesnt render too slowly as it growsp  pstrongEditstrong This is related to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1985542translatepointwithinacanvasmy other questiona.p  pstrongEditstrong Heres the markup for the user controls Im using for the nodesp  precodeltUserControl xClassGo.UI.GameNodeMarker              xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation              xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml              xmlnslocalclrnamespaceGo.UI              xmlnswpftoolsclrnamespaceWpfTools.ExtensionsassemblyWpfTools              xNameThisgt     ltUserControl.Resourcesgt         lt Some brushes, resources, etc. are omitted gt         ltStyle xKeyStoneStyle TargetTypexType Ellipsegt             ltSetter PropertyStrokeThickness Value0gt             ltSetter PropertyBitmapEffect ValueStaticResource StoneEffectgt             ltStyle.Triggersgt                 ltDataTrigger BindingBinding ElementNameThis, PathStoneColour  ValueBlackgt                     ltSetter PropertyFill ValueStaticResource BlackStoneBrushgt                 ltDataTriggergt                 ltDataTrigger BindingBinding ElementNameThis, PathStoneColour ValueWhitegt                     ltSetter PropertyFill ValueStaticResource WhiteStoneBrushgt                 ltDataTriggergt                 ltDataTrigger BindingBinding ElementNameThis, PathIsEmpty ValueTruegt                     ltSetter PropertyFill ValueStaticResource EmptyBrushgt                 ltDataTriggergt             ltStyle.Triggersgt         ltStylegt     ltUserControl.Resourcesgt     ltGridgt         ltEllipse StyleStaticResource StoneStylegt         ltTextBlock TextBinding ElementNameThis, PathText                    HorizontalAlignmentCenter                    VerticalAlignmentCenter                    FontWeightMediumgt     ltGridgt ltUserControlgt codepre  pThese are being added dynamically to a canvas in order to draw the tree.p

Negative 1967 pIn my game I have a base class of Loot which has methods universal to anything which can be picked up by the player and stored in his inventory. This would include potions, equipment, ammo, etc. I can equip arrows, but not potions. So Arrow would be a subclass of Ammo, which would ultimately derive from Loot. I can drink a potion but not an Arrow. So Potion would subclass Loot but implement IConsumeable. And so on.p  pLoot objects have a Quantity property 10 arrows 2 potions. In my Loot class I have a method called Split which allows the player to take a stack of items like arrows and split it into two separate stacks. So it decreases the Arrow instances Quantity by a certain amount, then returns a new Arrow instance with a Quantity value  to that which was taken from the original instance. p  pMy idea was that Id write the method in Loot since any Loot can be stacked so long as its int StackLimit property is greater than 1.

Negative 1967 pIve been looking at glibcnptls implementation of cancellation points, and comparing it to POSIX, and unless Im mistaken its completely wrong. The basic model used isp  precodeint oldtype  LIBCASYNCCANCEL  switch to asynchronous cancellation mode  int result  INLINESYSCALL... LIBCCANCELRESEToldtype codepre  pAccording to POSIXp  blockquote   pThe sideeffects of acting upon a cancellation request while suspended during a call of a function are the same as the sideeffects that may be seen in a singlethreaded program when a call to a function is interrupted by a signal and the given function returns [EINTR]. Any such sideeffects occur before any cancellation cleanup handlers are called.p blockquote  pMy reading of this passage is that if I call codeopencode, I can expect it emeitherem to get cancelled along with my whole thread before it fails to open a file, emorem to return a valid file descriptor or 1 and codeerrnocode value, but never to create a new file descriptor then lose it into the void. On the other hand, the glibcnptl implementation of cancellation points seems to allow for a race condition where the cancellation request occurs just after the syscall returns but before codeLIBCCANCELRESETcode takes place.p  pAm I crazy, or is their implementation really this broken And if so, does POSIX allow such broken behavior which seems to render cancellation completely unusable unless you defer it manually, or are they just blatantly ignoring POSIXp  pIf this behavior is in fact broken, whats the correct way to implement it without such a race conditionp

Negative 1967 pIm developing a Django application on Google Appengine, and I came across a db design problem where multitable inheritance seems to be the best solution. Unfortunately, however, multitable inheritance is not supported on Appengine because it requires JOINs.  Im looking for an alternative solution that meets the following requirementsp  p See updates at bottom  p  pThere are 3 different user types, or profilesp  ol liBusiness i.e. ownerli liEmployeeli liClientli ol  pThese profiles share certain attributes, but also have unique attributes for their respective types. For example, all profiles have a contact email and phone number, but only Businesses need to provide a logo or specify their business type.p  pIn addition, I need to be able to retrieve Profile objects from the db regardless of type, and get the extended or child profile for each Business, Employee, or Client.  Also, a Business, Employee, or Client object should also be able to access the parent profile easily.  In other words, the relationship needs to work in both direction like codeprofile.employeecode or codeemployee.profilecode.p  pSo far, I have come up with two possible solutionsp  pOneToOneField in child modelp  precodeclass Profilemodels.Model    Profile may exist before user claims it   user  models.OneToOneFieldUser, blankTrue, nullTrue     email ...   phone ...   ... other common fields ...  class Businessmodels.Model   profile  models.OneToOneFieldProfile, verbosenameuser profile, relatednamebizprofile  class Employeemodels.Model   profile  models.OneToOneFieldProfile, verbosenameuser profile, relatednameemployeeprofile  class Clientmodels.Model   profile  models.OneToOneFieldProfile, verbosenameuser profile, relatednameclientprofile codepre  pThis will allow me to do the following codeprofile.bizprofilecode and codebiz.profilecodep  pUnique Generic Foreign Key in parent modelp  precodeclass Profilemodels.Model     contenttypemodels.ForeignKeyContentType     objectidmodels.PositiveIntegerField     contentobjectgeneric.GenericForeignKeycontenttype,objectid     email ...     phone ...     ... other common fields ...    class Meta       uniquetogether  contenttype, objectid  class Businessmodels.Model     profiles  generic.GenericRelationProfile  class Employeemodels.Model   profiles  generic.GenericRelationProfile  class Clientmodels.Model   profiles  generic.GenericRelationProfile codepre  pThis will allow me to do the following codeprofile.contentobjectcode and codebiz.profiles.all[0]codep  pThe first approach OneToOneField seems the most straight forward, but I would need to come up with a better way to know which child to call, perhaps by setting the contenttype in the Profile model creating a method likep  precodedef getinstanceself    Need to look at contenttype framework, but you get the idea   if self.contenttype  business     return self.bizprofile   elif self.contenttype  employee     return self.employeeprofile   elif self.contenttype  client     return self.clientprofile   return None codepre  pIm not set on either of these solutions, so I welcome any alternative solutions or improvements to what I have here.p  pThanks in advancep  pstrongUPDATEstrongbr My original requirements have changed since I first posted.  It turns out I only need parentchild access NOT childparent.  In light of this, Im going to use the unique Generic Foreign Key approach instead.

Negative 1967 pIm a newbie to Netscape pluginsp  pWe are working on converting webkit plugins to netscape  for Safari 5.1 on Mac 10.7 as webkit plugins are no longer supported in Safari 5.1p  pWe tried to run NetscapeMoviePluginprovided in developerexamplesWebkit in 10.5 . The plugin is loaded, but does not work as expected. Nothing happens when we click on any buttonin HTML page. 1.Plugin is initialized properly  NPInitialize is called NPGetEntryPoints is called 2.On clicking any button, NPPGetValue is invoked. Nothing happens there after.  Here is an extract from the HTML page .p  pAs per NPAPI framework, when browser encounters plugin.movie.play in HTML Page through JavaScript, it has to call Invoke method of the plugin class. But nothing happens. Neither HasMethod nor  HasProperty is called. Even when we try to print play.movie in an alert, we get undefined error. p  pWe need help in invoking plugin APIs from browser for  making a scriptable NPAPI plugin. Any working scriptable netscape plugin samples for Safari 5.1 are greatly appreciated. Thanks in advancep

Negative 1967 pI need to create a collection of collections. The collection is called by multiple threads to add items and lookup items. Once added the items will not be removed.

Negative 1967 pI want to ask if someone can give me some hints with a design decision I want to make.p  pMy project will feature some sprites expecting 10 to 30 on the screen at once, and there are several ways to implement them. One way would be CSSSprites, another is drawing them on a canvas. Both are not difficult. The background will be a tilemap drawn by another codeltcanvasgtcode, in the background.p  pIve seen that a hrefhttpcraftyjs.comCraftya attaches Sprites as codeltdivgtcode that is in the HTML within the codeltcanvasgtcode, as a CSSSprite. I am not sure if theres a speed difference if the codeltdivgtcode is in the canvas or not. Is there a differencep  pI expect the user to interact with the sprites, by mouse clicks, left, right, etc. And the sprites are of course standing or walking on elements of the tile map. So is it more efficient to write a handler for the codeltcanvasgtcode and find the sprite, or rather using the codeltdivgtcode and let the browser handle the findingp  pI hope I could communicate my problem.p

Negative 1967 pI am having an issue understanding issue to be honest with NSFetchedResultsController and the new NSOrderedSet relationships available in iOS 5.p  pI have the following datamodel ok, my real one is not drawers and socks but this serves as a simple examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdWE9y.png altenter image description herep  pDrawer and Sock are both NSManagedObjects in a Core Data modelstore. On codeDrawercode the codesockscode relationship is a strongordered tomanystrong relationship to codeSockcode. The idea being that the socks are in the drawer in a specific order.

I dont really want to have a sort order but codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode, which is a great component is insisting there has to be one. How can I tell it to use the socks order on the Drawer entity.

Negative 1967 pI have a container that Im applying curved corners to with css3pie. Inside that element I have a table that is wider than the container. This causes scroll bars at the bottom of the container which is what I not only expect but need. The issue is that if I have applied css3pie to the container the scroll bar will not scroll when clicked and dragged. I can click on the arrows at both ends and it will scroll or I can click in the space where the scroll bar is not and it will jump to that place. So it only will not scroll when I click and drag the scroll bar.p  pIf I comment out the bahaivor on the class for the container scrolling will work again. If I apply css3pie though javascript scrolling will break. If I remove the class from the container while pie is enabled as a behavior scrolling works.p  pI have also put the table inside another div inside the container with the same results.p  pIm running in IE9 documents mode IE7p  pIs there any way to correct this issuep

ClassA can not be changed. I ended up with no idea how this can be done because the first call inside the ClassB constructor needs to be the call to super. Untill the super was called there is no state for ClassB and the value produced by the someRandomIntegerValGenerator can not be assigned to no ClassB member. The only direction I had was using a      ThreadLocal but I think it should be some easier solution.p  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 1967 pI am busy reading, and enjoying, Dependency Injection in .Net by Mark Seemann.p  pIt is quite difficult for me to explain the exact context, so please only bother with this question if you are familiar with the book.p  pMy question has to do with the two Product classes in chapter 2 pg 49. There is one in the Domain layer and one in the data access layer. It is explained that Product class in the data access layer was created by the Linq to Entity wizard. p  pI am working with Linq to SQL, and I could adorn my model class with Ling to SQL attributes, so that I dont have to have a second class. E.g.p  precode[TableNameCustomers] public class Customer    [ColumnIsPrimaryKeytrue]   public string CustomerID   [Column]   public string City  codepre  pHowever I feel this is mixing concerns and it will in effect tightly couple my domain layer to the Linq to SQL data access layer. Do you agree with thisp  pLets assume I create two Customer classes, for the domain and data access layer. Lets say City is a required field. When saving, this rule needs to be checked. Should this be done in the domain layer or the data access layer, or bothp  pThanks, Darynp

Negative 1967 pIt seems to be the prevailing opinion that using protected data members is a bad idea. Im wondering what a good alternative would be in a specific case.p  pTake the following class called CModule, which represents a audio module Amigastyle tracker music.

CModule holds all the common functionality, the derived classes implement loading and effects for each specific format.p  precodeclass CModule  public          CModulestring Filename Song file name to load.

Base class code calls these when needed.         virtual void Load0         virtual void Effects0          Song informationdata.         vectorltCInstrumentgt Instruments         vectorltCPatterngt Patterns         And much, MUCH more...  codepre  pAlmost all the data members are protected since the derived classs Load function needs to fill them all. This is considered bad since it can break encapsulation if someone derives a class from the derived class. What would be the proper way to solve this problem Ive already found that using getterssetters is considered bad too.p  pMany thanks to anyone taking the time to read this  p

Negative 1967 pI have a problem with requirejs. Maybe I dont really get how it should be working, but for me it seems quite counterproductive that requirejs does not allow me to split up my code into different independent scripts. Since I am using Play and its template language to build up the structure of the page, I tried to insert different javascript logic into different parts of the page componentwise. For example I have a main.scala.html which contains components that every page needs, alltogether with their js logic. When another page needs a navigation bar, I insert this together with the corresponding logic. So I have a main.js and a navigation.js. Since they are only dependent on Jquery mobile and not on each other, I wanted to load them with different  tags. The second script never gets loaded so my intuition was that requirejs seems not to allow multiple datamain attributes on one page.p  pSo my questions is is it possible to have multiple independent scripts in one page using requirejs And if not, whyp  pThanks in advancep
Negative 1967 pI am scanning 5000 csv files into a database. Regrettably the files have , for 0. Thus when ever I run my script it crashes. I heard that this error is possible to avoid by simply disabling strict mode.  So I attempted to disable strict mode to allow me to read in an empty string as a 0 for my numeric fields. However the error persisted. p  pSo does disabling strict mode allow  to be read into a int field the  is two qoutes i.e. empty stringp  pIf so why did setting p  psqlmodep  pin the my.ini config file not fix the problem.p  pThank  youp

Negative 1967 pSorry if this question has already been asked, but I couldnt find quite what Ive been looking for.

I suppose in this example I would have to use IntPtr to deal with the matrices, i.e. something likep  precode[DllImporttest.dll,EntryPointmlfTest] public static extern void testfunction[In] numargout, ref IntPtr x, ref IntPtr y, ref IntPtr z, [In] IntPtr a, [In] ref double[,] b, [In] ref c codepre  pand then later try to get the data out of x,y,z via working around a bit with Marshal  I suppose Im also making some rather obvious mistakes, e.g. Im not sure I can just pass ref double[,] to the dll and expect it to work.p  pI suppose if absolutely necessary I could use MCR which would make things a lot easier, but right now Im constrained.p  pThanks in advance for your help.p

Negative 1967 pIs there any way to reset a remote branch pointer to a SHA that you know is in the remote reflog, but that you dont have in your local repop  pIm very familiar with how reset softmixedhard works on a local repo, but that doesnt help me here.p  pHeres the situation Im trying to fix.  I hadnt done a fetch in a little while and the remote master had been updated with a merge that I didnt have locally yet. p  pI screwed up and did a codegit push forcecode meaning to update only the remote feature branch but forgot an argument and ended up forcing the feature branch AND master to the revisions that I had locally.p  pThis meant that master was now missing a merge commit that had happened since I last fetched.  Were using github, so I had an email that told me the SHA that master was at previously.  I was also able to go to the url and see that the commit was still there not garbage collected yet.p  pI was able to fix it by just redoing the merge that I lost and pushing that out again which ended up changing the SHA because it was a different committer and time.   This isnt optimal and could have been much worse if Id been missing more than one merge commit on master.p  pWhat I would have like to have done was just codereset hardcode the remote master branch to the SHA that it was supposed to be at.  Is there any way to do that without SSH access to the repop  pThis is on github, so I dont have direct access to the repo to be able to ssh out there and reset it directly.p

Negative 1967 pI recently launched my desktop application and it got cracked after a few days. I posted a question on stack overflow and people said that i cannot stop that. In the start of the software i cannot allow this to happen and i want a solution. So, following is what i am thinking.p  pCurrently, I have desktop application that communicates with the web server to verify the user. Once the user is verified it saves the values in Registry. The hacker has bypassed the communication code and added fake values in registry and he can use my software now.p  pNow, i am planning to take some of my code from MAIN features of the software to a WEB SERVICE hosted somewhere else on a web server. Whenever the software needs to run that feature the software will give a call to the WEB SERVICE with the values in REGISTRY. I will verify those values and return the results. But if the values will not match my database then i will reject the call.p  pSo, my questions isbr 1 Do you think this solution is feasible br 2 According to my thinking, it will make the software useless to the hacker. What do you think br 3 Any flaws in this solution brp

Negative 1967 pI have tried to add a fairly simple extension on top of a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtraininggraphicsopenglindex.html relnofollowAndroids example OpenGL 2.0 projecta in order to add texturing to basic shapes. This strongseemsstrong pretty straightforward, but on certain devices Samsung Nexus S, LG Optimus 3D, Samsung Galaxy S the texture just does not render. p  pemThis is actually a problem that I am having on a much larger project, but I was able to reproduce the issue with the simple project below in the hope that someone here has an idea of where my code presents issues, or how to specifically architect GL textures for these devices maybe there are issues with the devices.emp  pTo give an idea of how this object is used In the GLSurfaceView.Renderers codeonSurfaceCreatedcode method I am instantiating a codeSquarecode object and in the codeonDrawFramecode method I am calling Squares codedrawcode method.

Essentially I just ran the page that created the table, ie index.php, and then directed the browser to exit.php and the table was deleted as I would have expected.

Basically the code is correct.  So feel free to use it if you need to do something like this, however dont do what I did and mess up the PATH TO THE FILE p  pemface palmemp

Negative 1967 pI am trying to generate a subprocess for a gui which will spawn a terminal. I want the data produced by this terminal stdout and stderr to be displayed on the window that appears as well as to a set log file. When I type the command directly in to a shell it works as intended, but when provided to a QProcess as a start command it doesnt actually write anything to the file.p  pFor example if the user doesnt have the binaries installed it should write to bin.log that the command was not found. I have set my environment for the spawned QProcess to be the same as the running parent process so that it can find bash and anything else, and have set the working directory before calling QProcess.start method. I wrote a test case which followsp  precodegnometerminal title SubTerminal e bash c foo [args to foo] amp tee foo.log codepre  pIn Qt I do the followingp  precodeQProcess child  new QProcessthis QString   cmd    gnometerminal title SubTerminal e bash c foo [args to foo] amp tee foo.log childgtsetProcessEnvironmentltprocess environment I have created beforegt childgtsetWorkingDirectoryltcurrent working dirgt childgtstartcmd ... codepre  pIt generates the terminal but does not write any data to foo.log.

Negative 1967 pThe best lookup structure is a codeHashTablecode. It provides constant access emon averageem linear in worst case.br This depends on the hash function. Ok.br My question is the following. Assuming a good implementation of a codeHashTablecode e.g. codeHashMapcode is there a best practice concerning the keys passed in the mapI mean it is recommended that the key must be an immutable object but I was wondering if there are other recommendations.br Example the size of the key For example in a good hashmap in the way described above if we used codeStringcode as keys, wont the bottleneck be in the string comparison for codeequalscode trying to find the key So should the keys be kept small Or are there objects that should not be used as keys E.g. a codeURLcode In such cases how can you choose what to use as a key p

Negative 1967 pI have class with some setters and Id like setter injection to be used, but with a RuntimeDefinition its just not triggering.

I looked at the code for Adapter and the only difference I saw between that code and mine is that the setProfiler method had some doc comments with param in it, so I thought maybe reflection uses this. I added some to my code and it also doesnt work. Clearly Im missing something.

Negative 1967 pWhat would be the equivalent version of the iPhone simulator for iPod Touch 4G in xcode  p  pI am trying to simulate an app that I have on the appstore for close to a year now.  Recently, a new user complained that the app crashed on its iPod Touch 4G with IOS 6.0.1.  I decided to start the debug with the simulator.  But I am not sure which version of iPhone simulator I should use for the iPod 4G.  Is it iPhone 5p  pBTW, it is a pretty simple app which does not use any hardware features that are not available on iPod Touch 2G.  We tested the app on iPod Touch 2G at the time of release as a minimum hardware required.  It does use NSTimers and the users complain seems to revolve around it.p  pI appreciate any help.p  pThank you. Best regards,p

When I try to log into MySQL database using phpmyadmin the webpage just clears the username and password and stays at the log in page.

Im trying to optimize my script because currently its taking forever to run.p  pRecently I read from a site that one way you can further improve the speed of your script execution is to use a subroutine to store values in say a hash of arrays.

Negative 1967 pWith an emphasis on finding the time when the intersection starts, although the position is also important.  The bounding boxes not axis aligned have a position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocity rate of rotation.  NO accelerations, which should really simplify things...  And I could probably remove the angular velocity component as well if necessary.  Either a continuous or iterative function would work, but unless the iterative function actively converges toward a solution or lack thereof, it probably would be too slow.p  pI looked at a hrefhttpwww.metanetsoftware.comtechniquetutorialA.html relnofollowthe SATa, but it doesnt seem to be built to find the actual time of collision of moving objects.  It seems to only work with nonmoving snapshots and is designed to work with more complicated objects than rectangles, so it actually seems illsuited to this problem.p  pIve considered possibly drawing the trajectory out of each of the 8 points then somehow having a function for if a point is in or out of the other shape and getting a time range of that occurring, but Im pretty lost on how to go about that.  One nice feature would be that it operates entirely with time and ignores the idea of discrete steps, but it also strikes me as an inefficient approach.p  pNo worries about broad phase determining if its worth seeing if these two bounding boxes may overlap, I already have that tackled.p

This, however, sounds like a really ugly hack.p  pAlternatively, it should be possible to use codeCREATE CONSTRAINT TRIGGERcode and manually check for caseinsensitive uniqueness of course a regular index would still be necessary. This sounds a bit overcomplicated for such a simple and popular, I suppose requirement.p  pIs there any simpler andor more elegant way around this limitation p

The problem though, is that the footer seems to sit at the bottom of my window only, not at the bottom of the webpage which could extend well below my actual window when I have a lot of content. Right now, I have all the divs above set to position absolute as well the html and body are styled in the following wayp  precodehtml, body height100 margin0 padding0  html   background urlimgmultiblock.pngrepeat center center fixed  codepre  pp  pNow, the only way I can get my footer to remain at the bottom of the webpage is to set top3998px or whatever the height of my largest window is. Obviously this wont work once a webpage has enough content on it to expand it past that height. If I set position to relative, it appears at the top of my whole webpage and when positioned absolute it appears at the bottom of the viewable window only. You can check out the website at a hrefhttpwww.edmuncovered.com relnofollowhttpwww.edmuncovered.coma to see what I mean or to check the rest of the code. Parts of my website include adding content every day or so so I want to make sure the webpage can increase in height with added content, but that the formatting stays the same and the footer obviously stays at the bottom. Any ideasp

Google search didnt help a bit, it seems like no one else faced this kind of problem.p  pHere are some details of what I didp  p1 created the service application in Visual Studio 2012.

It finds it alright, but when I try to click OK it tells me to enter a valid password.

Negative 1967 h3Back Storyh3  pNEW PROJECT FROM MANAGEMENT I have been given a soft project from my boss to evaluate one of our current ETL plans to look for room for improvement in the process, and I am looking for guidance.p  pMOTIVE Excel is currently being used and crashes quite often during the process due to file size.p  pTASK Every month an analyst receives a large csv file from a survey vendor containing up to 750 columns not all unique names with over 15,000 rows to simply transform a large csv file into an excel file with seven worksheets broken up based on the column headings in the csv. Details of how it is broken up is below.p  pMy question is one large csv being transformed into an edited excel file with multiple worksheets any easier or quicker using VB.NET and VS2010 or VBA for that matter, or would using Excel be the simplilest way to continue this process I am an Expert Excel user but I am still very much a beginner to intermediate at coding in VBA, VB.NET or any other language.p  hr  h3Detailed Questionh3  pI am open to using free or open source software, but I am most familiar with VB.NET and Excel and ExcelVBA. I have played around a bit coding a simple windows form application to load the csv into a datatable using similar a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarymicrosoft.visualbasic.fileio.textfieldparser.aspx relnofollowTextFieldParser code found herea. I have thought of loading it into an array or even a 2d array to more easily edit the column headings and find the duplicate column headings. The datatable option still leaves me with more questions than answers because I need unique column headings and not sure if I should bother with a datatable if Im going to just write an excel file right away.  I tried a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles9258AFastCSVReader relnofollowCSVreader from CodeProjecta wont work on files with duplicate header names. I feel as though I am having writers block as I am not sure which direction I should take handle such a process. Any input you can provide will be much appreciated, and I apologize if this question does not have a single and clear best answer, Thanks.p  hr  h3Current Analyst tasks using excelh3  pThe current analytical plan has said analyst to open the csv in excel, insert a row above row 1 and use a vlookup to replace the New column names with the Old column names based on a simple two column lookup table on a separate worksheet. For example p  precodeNew becomes Old orgname becomes orgname or  item1Vendor becomes item1 or datecreatedSurvey becomes datecreated etc...checking all sent New columns against the list of all possible 750 columns. codepre  pThen they paste values of the first row and then delete the 2nd row which contained the New headings we want to change.p  pThen the analyst has to fix the primary key on the file which is called sid. The Survey ID field sid should have a number for each row of the data file.  Sometimes the sid shows up under the sidHCAHPS or the sidCGCAHPS fields instead. The analyst would insert a column next to the sid field and put a formula in it like this, for example codeIFBE2ltgt,BE2,IFRD2ltgt,RD2,IFUH2ltgt,UH2,code Actual cell references would change but in the example excel formula,p  precodesidRangeBE2 sidHCAHPSRangeRD2 sidCGCAHPSRangeUH2 codepre  pOnce the newly created primary key column is made and filled without blanks, we can delete the original sid column.p  pThe next step is to check the columns because there may be a redundant HCAHPS section of columns due to a second survey being sent and then returned coded as Wave 2, delete second set of columns sidHCAHPS through languagep  pNext is the largest alteration because we have setup a system where we send this information to our database admins in the form of a seven worksheet excel file to be loaded by an MS Access Query that creates a table from each sheet that gets loaded into our proprietary business intelligence software.

Negative 1967 pI have been learning about templates in C and they seem very handy. However, there was a note about the problems using templates in a large, multifile project in a hrefhttpwww.cplusplus.comdoctutorialtemplates relnofollowhttpwww.cplusplus.comdoctutorialtemplatesa at the very bottom Because templates are compiled when required, this forces a restriction for multifile projects the implementation definition of a template class or function must be in the same file as its declaration.p  pSo take for example, wanting to write a 2D Vector class template which operates on codeTcode typenamep  precode    template ltclass Tgt     class Vector          T x, y     public         VectorT x, T y                      thisgtx  x             thisgty  y                   void normalize                      T length  sqrtx  x  y  y              x  x  length             y  y  length               codepre  pMy question is rather simple, where would you put this template so that multiple .cpp files have access to it If you put it inside of, say, a Math.h file where you keep all of your other custom math related declarations, do you have to codeinlinecode the functions because they are in a header filep
Negative 1967 pIm going crazy with this one... trying to figure it out for almost 4 hours with no success...p  pIm trying to fetch a mysql query result set in a multidimensional array of 4 arrays. So if the result set returns 8 records, the array will contain 4 arrays of 2 records. If the result set returns 20 records, the array will contain 4 arrays of 5 records, and so on... Thats the easy part...p  pThe thing Im having trouble with is when the result set cannot be distributed evenly in 4 arrays. For example, if the result set returns 14 records, then the first array contains 4 records, the second array contains 4 records , the third array 3 records and the fourth array 3 records...p  pHeres what Ive coded so farp  precode...  numrows  stmtgtnumrows number of records returned by the result set arrays  4 distributed in 4 arrays  perarray  intnumrows  arrays minimum per array remainder  numrows  perarray the remainder  arrayr  array i  1 col  1  while stmtgtfetch      if i lt perarray          i      else          i  1         col           arrayr[col][]  array...values from result set...  codepre
Negative 1967 pIm new to processing DICOM images away from their native manufacturer software. I am trying to dicomread a PET image from a set of reconstructed transaxial slices into MatLab. My aim is to do some simple segmentation and finally determine the maximum and minimum pixel value in the segment. However I am having trouble with converting the stored values to their values seen on the native system.p  pThe image is loading into MatLab as an int16 class. The maximum pixel value is always 32767, regardless of which slice I load from the series. I know from viewing the images on their native system that the maximum pixel value in each slice is different. p  pIve checked the rescale value and rescale intercept values and the rescale relationship appears to be linear. Is there another correction I should be making I assume all other corrections e.g. decay, scatter and randoms are made during the reconstruction process.p  pAny help would be appreciated hopefully Im missing something simple.Ive posted the DICOM info retrieved from the header below Dont worry, the images are of a phantom so there is no patient identifying data.p  pRegards,p  pRossp  precode

Negative 1967 pAs my learning of Scala continues, I have been intrigued by some of the choices in the Scala language. Consider the removal of static classes. In Java world from where I come, there is a distinct difference between a static member, a singleton and a instance member. There was always a persistent need for a singleton in Java which a static member could not really help with. The primary use cases I know for why a singleton may be preferred over a static member arep  ol liAbility to control the instantiation of an singleton object. If loading the instance of a class is resource heavy, we want to push it off for later till it is actually needed.li liAbility to configure a singleton object at runtime. Imagine having to read environment variables and populate our singleton at construction time. This cannot be done if the member is static since the information may not be known at class loading time.li ol  pIt appears however that Scalas implementation of singleton will be devoid of the above benefits. Look at the discussion here a hrefhttppbadenski.blogspot.com200906designpatternsinscalasingleton.html relnofollowhttppbadenski.blogspot.com200906designpatternsinscalasingleton.htmlap  pIt appears to me that does strongnotstrong Scala solve the singleton use cases at all. Which would be a disappointment.p  pIf my understanding is correct then the next question is How do we enable a lazy singleton pattern in Scalap  pSeems like we have to fight scala to get singleton the correct wayp  pPS This is not my blogp

Negative 1967 pI have migrated all my personal, pet projects to Dropbox, and this includes source code.p  pI enjoy using Python because I can switch to Windows or Linux machines, and I just to execute scripts and they work right away, no matter which OS or which specific machine I am using.p  pHowever, I would like to improve my workflow regarding REUSE of python functionality, which is overwhelmingly duplicated. Due to ineptlazy handling of imports, and the tendency to copypaste my own module files to the same folder of every new script, not to say reimplementing the same microfunctionality over and over, I am seriously motivated to stop this workflow and adhere to strong reuse by using bettercrafted, DRYed modules, and structured importing, ending up with higherlevel, lean, problemspecific scripts.p  pIts important context that Ive been bitten by the way .Net works in VisualStudio, you just go on codeusingcode namespaces right away well, sort of, provided the right references have been added, we know.p  pI have read quite a lot about .pth files, stronginitstrong.py files, appending to codesys.pathcode, but that has been quite confusing to me.p  pMy goals would bep  ul liHave a folder inside Dropbox or GDrive, or whatever, with two subfolders codeScriptscode and codeModulescodeli licodeScriptscode folder would contain only independent, singlefile scripts, possibly inside subfolders in arbitrary levels of nesting, but they should not reference one another in any way, just reference the systeminstalled Python modules AND the modules packaged in codeScriptscode folderli licodeModulescode folder should contain some hierarchical structure of folders and namespaces, with higherlevel modules importingreusing lowerlevel modules, and any of these modules using systeminstalled Python modules.li ul  pAn additional desireable feature would be the ability to move some script elsewhere in the computer copy it to desktop folder, for exemple and with minimal or no modification it would still run, by still referencing modules inside codeDropboxthatMagicFolderModulescode.p  pA typical workflow that would reflect my needsp  ol liI create a script in one machine, and make it run properlyli liThen I go to another machine also with Dropbox, install some lacking python modules say, Numpy, or PIL, and then run the script I created in the other machineli liI update the script, adding some imports to more alreadyexisting modules from codeModulescode folder, and make it run properly. Ideally, the scripts would contain minimal if any boilerplate codeli liI come back to the previous machine, wait for Dropbox to sync, and run the updated script right awayli ol  pI dont have a firm idea on how to achieve this, and my few previously mentioned tries with codeinitcode files and .pth files instead of simplify ended up making everything more complicated.

Negative 1967 pSo I have a program that pulls random images from a folder and creates a collage out of them, and set it to the windows wallpaper.  Which seems to work fine.

Negative 1967 pHopefully this hasnt been asked and answered elsewhere...p  pIm teaching myself Backbone.js, and PHP, and the PHP framework SLIM and require.js and bootstrap while Im at it, and god, so much stuff...p  pAnyway, when Backbone does a PUT command to the server, it sends a JSON packet, and numeric values are wrapped in quotes, like thisp  precodegivennameJoe,familynameSmith,id1 codepre  pId like SLIM to see the id variable value as an integer or float rather than a string before I really start messing with it.

Negative 1967 pIm looking for an efficient way of selecting a relatively large portion of points 2D Euclidian graph that are the furthest away from the center. This resembles the convex hull, but would include many more points. Further criteriap  ul lipThe number of points in the selection  set K must be within a specified range. Most likely it wont be very narrow, but it most work for different ranges eg. 0.01N lt K lt 0.05N as well as 0.1N lt K lt 0.2N. pli lipThe algorithm must be able to balance distance from the center and local density. If there are dense areas near the upper part of the graph range, but sparse areas near the lower part, then the algorithm must make sure to select some points from the lower part even if they are closer to the center than the points in the upper region. See example belowpli lipBonus rather than simple distance from center, taking into account distance to a specific point or both a point and the center would be perfect. pli ul  pMy attempts so far have focused on using pigeon holing divide graph into CxR boxes, assign points to boxes based on coordinates and selecting outer boxes until we have sufficient points in the set. However, I havent been successful at balancing the selection dense regions overselected because of fixed box size nor at using a selected point as reference instead of only the center.p  pIve poorly drawn an a hrefhttpi.imgur.comPh6ya4m.png relnofollowExamplea The red dots are the points, the green shape is an example of what I want outside the green  selected. For sparse regions, the bounding shape comes closer to the center to find suitable points but doesnt necessarily find any, if theyre too close to the center. The yellow box is an example of what my Pigeon Holing based algorithms does. Even when trying to adjust for sparser regions, it doesnt manage well.p  pAny and all ideas are welcomep

Negative 1967 pIm developing my first iOS app and Ive been trying to adhere for good MVC practices and laid out conventions to make me app easy to maintain and redevelop. Im making use of a Storyboard and largely I will use Push segues to navigate through my app. Here is a snapshot of my Storyboard.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVaxk6.png altenter image description here p  pWhen Add Staff is clicked, a push segue moves to Select Staff. Once on Select Staff, I select the staff I want and can return to the previous VC. I should mention that each VC has its own code.mcode and code.hcode which I subclassed from UIViewController. Here is what it looks like when used.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9DWtW.png altenter image description herep  pNow Ive hit a brick wall in transferring the selected data rows back to the first VC. My problem is that I dont know how to best transfer data back to a VC from one which has been pushed by it. In the Select Staff VC, I have an array codecurrentSelectedcode which correctly holds the Strings of the selected rows, but I want to access this array in the Create VC once I have rolled back.p  pHow do I best go about doing thisp  pP.S. Its worth noting that I realise there are similar questions to this one, but they are either for slightly varying issues, slightly complex or folder older versions of XCode which talk about XIBs and stuff. For the past while Ive been researching the literature on the issue and cant make effective headway, so I hope this explains why I made this question.p

Negative 1967 pI am creating an entirely ajax site and one of the issues is that you cant provide links to direct pages as a result. I made it so that it appends the name of the page into the url every time you click an ajax link, but now I need a php script in my main file that gets run EVERY time you click to load a page. This will check to see if any of the get variables are set and redirect you to the proper page. For example if I give you this link codehttptechxpertschicotechxpertsrepaircode then it should be able to load the appropriate content into the page rather than taking you to the homepage. I suspect that this will look similar to the code below. I just dont know how to make the ajax request happen on the isset request.

Negative 1967 pI recently came across a C class that implements a non zero index based array. I.e. one could initialize this class to have a valid index range of say 15..19. This class calculates the adress for the element with index 0, even though this probably is outside of allocated address space and stores that adress. Element access is then just handled via operator[] using this element 0 address. Some example code simplifiedp  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt class NonZeroArray    public   NonZeroArrayint minindex, int size, T defaultelement       mminindexminindex,      msizesize,     mdefaultelementdefaultelement      mbaseaddress  T mallocsizesizeofT     mzeroindexadress  mbaseaddress  minindex   NonZeroArray      freembaseaddress   Tamp elementint index       if  index lt mminindex  index gt mminindex  msize          return mdefaultelement     else         return mzeroindexadress[index]    private     int mminindex     int msize     T mbaseaddress     T mzeroindexadress     T mdefaultelement  codepre  pThis seems unneccessarily complicated to me. I really dont see why the developer didnt chose to implement element access via mbaseaddress[indexmminindex]. But worse, I am worried that this current implementation could be dangerous. The code seems to work reliably but I was wondering what would happen if there is an arithmetic overflow in the calculation of mzeroindexaddress, i.e. if the minimum index offset is greater than the allocatead address. Is there a chance for this to go horribly wrong or is this code always safep

Negative 1967 pIm new to codethree.jscode and am trying to set up what amounts to a 2D visualization for an assortment of layered sprites using these 3D tools. Id like some guidance on the codePerspectiveCameracode arguments and codecamera.position.setcode arguments. I already have a nudge in the right direction from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma114696142441384this answera to a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11456758isthereattwojscounterparttothreejs1607126516071265related questiona, which said to set the codezcode coordinate equal to code0code in codecamera.position.setx,y,zcode.p  pBelow is the snippet of code Im modifying from one of a hrefhttpsgithub.comstemkoskistemkoski.github.com relnofollowstemkoskis three.js examplesa. The parts that are hanging me up for the moment are the values for the codeVIEWANGLEcode, codexcode, and codeycode. Assuming I want to have a flat camera view on a plane the size of the screen how should I assign these variables Ive tried range of values but its hard to tell from the visualization what is happening. Thanks in advancep  precodevar SCREENWIDTH  window.innerWidth, SCREENHEIGHT  window.innerHeight    var VIEWANGLE  , ASPECT  SCREENWIDTH  SCREENHEIGHT, NEAR  0.1, FAR  20000 camera  new THREE.PerspectiveCamera VIEWANGLE, ASPECT, NEAR, FAR scene.addcamera var x  , y  , z  0 camera.position.setx,y,z camera.lookAtscene.position codepre  pstrongUPDATE  perspective vs orthographic camerastrongp  pThanks GuyGood, I realize I need to make a design choice about the perspective camera versus the orthographic camera. I now see that the codePerspectiveCameracode, even in this 2D context would allow for things like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma148230212441384parallaxa, whereas codeOrthographicCameracode would allow for literal rendering of sizes no diminishing with distance no matter what layer my 2D element is on. Im inclined to think Ill still use the codePerspectiveCameracode for effects such as small amounts of parallax between the sprite layers so I guess my project is not purely 2D.p  pIt seems then that the main thing is to make all the sprite layers parallel to the viewing plane and that codecamera.position.setcode is the orthogonal viewing line to the center of the field of view.This must be basic for so many folks here it is such a new world to mep  pI think I still have a hard time wrapping my head around the role of codeVIEWANGLEcode, codexcode, and codeycode and the distance between the camera and the far and near viewing planes in a 2D visualization. With the orthogonal camera this is pretty immaterial  you just need enough depth to include all the layers you want and a viewing plane that suits the scale of your sprites. However, with the perspective camera the role of depth and field influences the effect of parallax, but are there other considerations as wellp  pstrongUPDATE 2  Angle of view and other variablesstrongp  pAfter a bit more tooling around in pursuit of how to think about Angle of View Field of View, or FOV for the camera and the x,y,z arguments for the camera position, I came across this helpful a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvblZUao2jTGA relnofollowvideo summary of the role of Field of View in game designa a close enough analog to answer my questions for my 2D visualization. Along with this a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchveCa1dfl5o7k relnofollowField of View tutorial for photographersa that I also found helpful if maybe a touch cheesy , these two resources helped me get a sense of how to choose a Field of View for my project and what happens with either very wide or narrow Fields of View which are measured in number of degrees out of 360. The best results are a mix of what feels like a natural field of vision for a human, depending on the distance of the screen or projection from their face, and is also keenly related to the relative scale of things in the foreground versus background in the visualization wider fields of view make the background look smaller, narrower fields of view magnify the background  similar to, though not as pronounced as the effect of an orthographic camera. I hope you find this as helpful as I didp  pstrongUPDATE 3  Further readingstrongp  pFor anyone zesting for more detail about camera specifications in a range of uses, you may find chapter 13 of a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick0321399528 relnofollowComputer Graphics Principles and Practicea as useful as I have for addressing my above questions and much more.p

Main thing is that i wanna keep the superclss like that, maybe just adding a method there so extract the 4 values..and passing them as arguments p  precodeimport java.lang.Math  public final class PlayableSideDeck extends SideDeck     private final static int MaxCArrayValue4     public final int[] sidecardsPlay  new int[MaxCArrayValue]     public PlayableSideDeckSideDeck sidecards       sidecardsPlay[0]0         sidecardsPlay[1]0         sidecardsPlay[2]0         sidecardsPlay[3]0       SetDeckltCan i call a private method in the constructor              public void SetDeck           forint j0jlt4j                 int positionsuper.sidecards[PickDeck]ltthis is the main problem.. since its gonna call the object i guess.                  sidecards[j]position                 System.out.printlni   i     j   j   new sidecard   sidecards[j]    old sidecard  super.sidecards[PickDeck]                              forint j0jltMaxCArrayValuej                 sidecardsPlay[j]super.sidecards[PickDeck]                 System.out.printlni   i     j   j   new sidecard   sidecardsPlay[j]    old sidecard  super.sidecards[PickDeck]   random   PickDeck                         public int PickDeck         return intMath.random  8           public String toString     String s     forint i0iltMaxCArrayValuei             s  Card n   i1      sidecards[i]                  return s       codepre  pThanks.p

Negative 1967 pI would like to make a html interface to change values of global variables in another .js file.p  pIn that html interface, there will be couple of text inputs one submit button and restore button. When user changes particular values and push OK button the global variables inside that .js file will be updated. So they will not change back when my webapp reloads.p  pI would like to have there also a RESTORE button to restore last state of variables before last change. This interface could make a backup of variables when hitting OK button.p  pIs something like this possible I dont like to ask such a broad and abstract question, but I will appreciate any starting info.p  pI know that more efficient way would be to use MySQL and php.

Negative 1967 pI have a very large OSGi project with about 300 bundles. When I import the project in Eclipse and do a codeProject gt Clean...code and codeProject gt Build Allcode it takes about 10 minutes until everything is build and I can start my application. p  pI think that 10 minutes are already pretty long, but when I execute a headless PDE build with Ant scripts it takes about an hour I think something goes pretty wrong...p  pDo you have any hint for me how to speedup the Antbased build Or how to track the problem down I use the normal PDE build with a command like below. I have no idea why it is so much slower compared to a complete build in Eclipse.p  precodejava jar eclipsepluginsorg.eclipse.equinox.launcherltversiongt.jar application org.eclipse.ant.core.antRunner buildfile  eclipsepluginsorg.eclipse.pde.buildltversiongtscriptsbuild.xml Dbuilderltpath to the build configuration foldergt codepre  pThanks,  Thomasp  pPS.

Negative 1967 pI always learnt, that shared memory is the fastest way to share data between two threads like e.g. a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1550dochtmlinterprocess.html relnofollowhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1550dochtmlinterprocess.htmla. However, today I discovered that using codeboostrefXcode it is possible to give codeboostcode a reference to codeXcode enabling access to codeXcode from outside the thread. Therefore the following pseudocode should workp  precodeMyObjext Xpara1,para2  MyObject has a  operator boostthread thrboostrefX X.setSomeMember1 codepre  pThis got me thinking  Assuming codesetSomeMembercode is thread safe, then  for most applications  this  approach seems much easier, since most applications spawn their threads as they need and thus can always save and access the object codeXcode. So, why would I use shared memory or message queues anyway, if I have access to the thread object directly Is it maybe faster Or am I missing something herep

Negative 1967 pUsing and playing around with the Les Miserables Json data, I coded from modifications in d3.   I was able to code everything except highlightingmarking a node if it is in the fixed state vs the force graph layout.  When you double click a node, it will freeze, a drag and move will pin it somewhere while all the other nodes by default in the force layout.  When you double click the node again, the node is unpinned, and floating in the force layout as usual.  The second thing I wanted to do is that if the node is in a pinned state, the node should be a different color, or highlighted somehow.  I tried a few ways within the method chaining, checking with conditional statements for the node state to modify the node features, but they are not working.  I also separated out the dblclick handler as an outside function which is my current version.p  pI put my code here of the original attempt within the method chains a hrefhttppastebin.comSqrqgVET relnofollowhttppastebin.comSqrqgVETap  pI also tried another way, using a variable pinned to determine the state of the node, within the doubleclick, to modify the nodes border, and change the state accordingly but that is not changing the nodes appearance either. There is a console.log statement, and the function is going into the if else portions accordingly.p  pa hrefhttppastebin.comdzEw42mQ relnofollowhttppastebin.comdzEw42mQap  pBelow is the current version.p  pAny feedback would be great.

Negative 1967 pIm using codeSetFileCompletionNotificationModescode API to optimize my IO completion ports loops, but it seems to not work properly. Even if I set FILESKIPCOMPLETIONPORTONSUCCESS for sockets and HANDLEs, an IO ports completion callback is still called also if codeReadFilecode codeWriteFilecode codeWSARecvcode codeWSASendcode do return emsynchronoslyem.p  pIm sure that the 3 conditions that MSDN says must be true A completion port is associated with the file handle, The file is opened for asynchronous IO, A request returns success immediately without returning ERRORPENDING are met, and are all true, so why I still receive IO completion callsp  pWhen i call codeSetFileCompletionNotificationModescode it returns success, so no errors or whatsoever, and the system is Windows 7.p  pHow I can replicate a scenario when after I have activated codeSetFileCompletionNotificationModescode on my socketHANDLEs, I can clearly see that the IO completion callback wont be calledp  pI guessed that it happens when I write few bytes on a socket, since the sockets buffer is quite bigger, I didnt full it, so another write of another few bytes shouldnt block, since there are still a lot of room in the buffer, so it should return immediately, but not with ERRORIOPENDING, just in a synchronous way, right more or less, in a similar way of unix EWOULDBLOCKEAGAIN when i call codewritecode for few bytes it returns immediately, and doesnt return EAGAIN, because there is still space in the write buffer.p  pWell it doesnt do that. Even for writing multiple times few bytes on a socket, it still calls the IO completion callback, avoding the benefits of setting FILESKIPCOMPLETIONPORTONSUCCESSp  pAm I missing something important Any clue about thatp  pNOTE I know that this wont work if the socket is only compatible with Layered Service Providers LSP that return Installable File Systems IFS handles, but thats not my case, it should work. Btw Im trying this also with pipes and files.p  pShouldnt files never call IO completion callbacks because they never block, just like in unix codereadcode and codewritecode calls on local files never returns EWOULDBLOCKEAGAIN, so codeReadFilecode and codeWriteFilecode with an handle set with FILESKIPCOMPLETIONPORTONSUCCESS should return immediatelyp

Negative 1967 pIm writing a program for my embedded Debian Linux system.  It has a cell modem that is brought up as ppp0 and also has eth0 that may or may not be plugged in.  How I want the system to work is for it to use ppp0 as the default route, unless it can establish a connection to the outside world over eth0, in that case eth0 should be made the default route.  The eth0 cable could be unplugged at any time.  To do this Ive written a C program that uses curl to try and establish a connection to a public web server over eth0.  If successful it then tries to go and make the default route eth0.  Ive borrowed some code from the Linux pppd project to manipulate the routing information.  The system boots up with ppp0 active.  I then run my program, and it detects it can make a connection via eth0 as the cable is plugged in, and it then changes the default route to eth0.  After that networking somehow stops working, I can no longer ping and public servers.  Somehow my changing the route has killed networking.  Before I run my program, the output of route isp  pre Kernel IP routing table Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface 80.sub661742                255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 ppp0 192.168.98.0                   255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0 loopback                       255.0.0.0       U     0      0        0 lo default                        0.0.0.0         U     0      0        0 ppp0 pre  pAfter I run my program, the output of route isp  pre Kernel IP routing table Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface 66.174.217.80                  255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 ppp0 192.168.98.0                   255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0 loopback                       255.0.0.0       U     0      0        0 lo default                        0.0.0.0         U     0      0        0 eth0 pre  pSo I cant see any obvious signs of whats wrong.

Negative 1967 pIn my Symfony 2 project we need to store a variety of information using dates and times. Currently in the database we are storing all of that information using codedatecode for the column type. And everything goes well when the information is stored for the first time in the database.p  pThe issue is that, when I use the same form type for modifying the information, the data is altered after issuing a codemergecode using Doctrine. Worse is, the database information, if I modify it without a frontend using a codeUPDATEcode command, is stored without any issues, and its displayed as it should be.p  pI have researched a bit on this issue, and its because Symfony takes the servers timezone and applies it to the input data during the transformation from view to model. PHP usually considers DSTs, but because of political issues PHP is not taking the correct DST end date it should have ended in March but it ended in April, and PHP takes the original March date and thus the data gets altered correspondingly.p  pWhat should I do to avoid this problem from happening any further In my country, DSTs have been somewhat variable in the last few years and I cannot trust my computer to take the correct date.

Negative 1967 pIve recently started learning to use myBatis.I am now facing such a scenario, I need to constantly fetch a new list of Objects through WebService, then for this list, I need to insertupdate each object into the oracle DB table through myBatis.p  pThe tricky part is, I cannot simply do a batch insert every time, because some of the objects might already exist in DB, for these records, I need to update the fields of them instead of a new insertion.p  pMy current solution might be very stupid, using Java, build the list of Object from webservice, loop through each of them, do a myBatis select, if it is not a nullalready exists in the db, then do a myBatis update otherwise, do a myBatis insert for this new object.p  pThe function is achieved. But my technical lead says it is very lowefficient, since doing a for loop using Java and insertupdate one by one will consume a lot of system resource. He advised me to do batch insert using myBatis by passing a list of objects in.p  pBatch insertion in myBatis is straightforward, however, since I am not purely insertingfor existing records I need to do update, I dont think batch insert is appropriate here. Ive googled a while for this, and realized maybe I will need to use merge instead of insert for Oracle.p  pThe examples I googled out for merge in myBatis is only for one object, not in a batch. Thus I want to find out whether experts could offer me some examples on how to do a batchmerge in MyBatis The correct way to write a Mapperp

Negative 1967 pCurrently I am using a codeFlowLayoutPanelcode to display my custom controls, it has worked well so far but now seems to be lacking when I want to change the layout of the controls per user requests. I have been trying to find a way to change the codeWrapContentscode attribute of the codeFlowLayoutPanelcode to reapply the layout of the panel with the new attribute but keep falling short. p  pSo I was wondering if there was a completely different solution. p  pI have two types of controls I want to display to the user, banners and indicators. For every banner there are 2448 indicators along with it They represent electrical boards. I want to display these controls to the user in two ways. First in one long list which codeFlowLayoutPanelcode did pretty well with codeWrapContents  falsecode and second in columns of lists, one per banner So each column would be headed by a banner with its indicators beneath. p  pBelow is a picture of how codeFlowLayoutPanelcode did at this task. For the first method of one long list it was simple, just set codeWrapContents  falsecode and everything would line up in one nice long list. The problem I was having was for the second method more specifically getting the codeFlowLayoutPanelcode to switch between the two methods of displaying the forms. As you can see with codeWrapContentscode set to codetruecode the codeLayoutEnginecode creates columns, but overflows them to the next column. I never tried to fix this, I am still stuck on how to reapply the layout after setting codeWrapContentscode on a codeFlowLayoutPanelcodep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comc7Vn7.png altenter image description herep  pSo my question is, is there a better solution to my problem. p  ul liIs there a layout panel that I can display my controls in the two manners described li liAlso, easily switch between the two at the users request by means of a checkboxbutton that would redrawrelayout the controlsli ul

So far everything works fine.p  pThe sprite consists in two bitmaps. First contains the complete sequence of drawings, and the second is dynamically drawn through a codeCanvasbitmapcode. The result bitmap and its canvas are created in the sprite constructor to avoid reallocations in the draw loop.p  pI reuse this sprites for each object that needs the same sequence of drawings. This sprites also have a function that allows to obtain a bitmap containing a different position of the drawings sequence. So, if the object wants the sprite in another position calls its function to get the Bitmap and draws to the main canvas.p  pSo the problem is that all objects using the same sprite end up drawing the same image.p  ul lipIn the visible game objectp  pcodeifspriteDelay gt 0 img  sprite.getDelayedBitmapspriteDelay else img  sprite.getCurrentBitmap canvas.drawBitmapimg, null, focusLocation, nullcodepli lipIn the spritep  pcodecurrentBmpCanvas.drawColorColor.TRANSPARENT, PorterDuff.Mode.CLEAR  currentBmpCanvas.drawBitmapscaledImage, delayedIni, fin, null  return currentBmpcodepli ul  pIf I create a new result bitmap and a new canvas in the returning function all works finep  precodecurrentBmp  Bitmap.createBitmapwidth, height, Bitmap.Config.ARGB8888 currentBmpCanvas  new CanvascurrentBmp codepre  pI assume that all bitmaps are not drawn until onDraw is finished, so is there some way to solve this without reallocating the bitmap in each loopp  pThanksp

Both produce logical arrays and both accept double arrays. In fact, codeA0code would work with codeNaNscode too, wheras codeAcode wont.

This is evidenced by the fact that coderequest.referrercode at this point is the URL of the link I clicked on to interrupt the ajax request instead of the URL of the page the request actually originated from.p  pSo, given all this, I have no idea how to fix this.

Negative 1967 pIn visual studio 2012 and Im assuming beyond, calls to async functions that are not awaited come up with warnings, i.e.p  precodepublic static async Task FunctionAsync      await Task.Delay10   public static void SyncCaller      FunctionAsync  codepre  pSyncCallers only line of code will show a compiler warning Because this call is not awaited, the current method continues to run before the call is completed.p  pHowever, if I rewrite SyncCallerp  precodepublic static void SyncCaller      Task.Factory.StartNew gt     codepre  pTheres no such warning, but its very clear from StartNews documentation that it returns an awaitable Task. So, what am I missing Why is StartNew not warning me of my possible mistakep  pFurthermore, if someone would be kind enough to comment on my question and point me in the direction of some discussion about how the await operator works under the covers, I would be much obliged. The syntax seems to be designed to hide a LOT, as I can write a method that returns Tasks, when the method body at no point creates any such thing.p  pEDIT Others seem to think that you cannot await what StartNew returns. To give an examplep  precode    public static async void SyncCaller              await Task.Factory.StartNew gt        codepre  pThat method correctly awaits the completion of the Task that StartNew returns, so I do not think StartNew is an exception to the new asynchronous model.p

Negative 1967 pI recently set up a service to validate and record purchases from my iOS in accordance with a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosreleasenotesGeneralValidateAppStoreReceiptChaptersValidateRemotely.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40010573CH104SW1 relnofollowApples documentationa. After a few purchases had gone through I reviewed my table and found that I had 45 purchases that came back with a status code of 0 which according to Apples docs means that they are valid.

Upon closer examination of the JSON responses from Apple with the status of 0 I found two variationsp  precode     status 0,     environment Production,     receipt          receipttype Production,         adamid 888310447,         appitemid 888310447,         bundleid com.studioName.gameName,         applicationversion 1.4,         downloadid 62010318102259,         versionexternalidentifier 810789159,         requestdate 20141216 153417 EtcGMT,         requestdatems 1418744057267,         requestdatepst 20141216 073417 AmericaLosAngeles,         originalpurchasedate 20140708 180428 EtcGMT,         originalpurchasedatems 1404842668000,         originalpurchasedatepst 20140708 110428 AmericaLosAngeles,         originalapplicationversion 1.1,         inapp []       codepre  hr  precode     status 0,     environment Production,     receipt          receipttype Production,         adamid 888310447,         appitemid 888310447,         bundleid com.studioName.gameName,         applicationversion 1.4,         downloadid 39011903209949,         versionexternalidentifier 810789159,         requestdate 20141216 151110 EtcGMT,         requestdatems 1418742670718,         requestdatepst 20141216 071110 AmericaLosAngeles,         originalpurchasedate 20141015 055228 EtcGMT,         originalpurchasedatems 1413352348000,         originalpurchasedatepst 20141014 225228 AmericaLosAngeles,         originalapplicationversion 1.2.4,         inapp [                              quantity 1,                 productid com.studioName.gameName.productName,                 transactionid 190000148450370,                 originaltransactionid 190000148450370,                 purchasedate 20141129 082249 EtcGMT,                 purchasedatems 1417249369000,                 purchasedatepst 20141129 002249 AmericaLosAngeles,                 originalpurchasedate 20141017 083026 EtcGMT,                 originalpurchasedatems 1413534626000,                 originalpurchasedatepst 20141017 013026 AmericaLosAngeles,                 istrialperiod false                      ]       codepre  pNote that the first objects inapp array is empty while the second seems to actually have a receipt for the IAP.  My assumption was that I should look to the receipts that have the inapp array populated.  My issue is now that I have parsed out the receipts without an inapp array I am still left with 25 valid purchases 3 more than was recorded by Apple.p  pMy next thought was that maybe some of these purchases were restores.  I found a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosreleasenotesGeneralValidateAppStoreReceiptChaptersReceiptFields.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40010573CH106SW12 relnofollowthis notea in the Receipt Validation Programming guide.  It states under the original transaction identifier p  pemFor a transaction that restores a previous transaction, the transaction identifier of the original transaction. Otherwise, identical to the transaction identifier.emp  pAfter I examined all of my valid receipts I found no instances where the codeoriginaltransactionidcode and the codetransactionidcode were different.  For that matter I made a duplicate purchase which gave me the prompt that the item had already been purchased and asked if I would like to restore it for free.  When I did so and checked the receipt I found that even in this instance the two transaction ids were the same which should not be the case.  p  pWhen I put in an inquiry I received a canned response telling me that the IAP section of itunes was working properly.  If anyone could help to shed some light on how I could better filter these to match Apples final count of IAPs it would be much appreciatedp

Negative 1967 pIve been working on a site, built by someone else, at this point I am unable to find where I need to edit the menu. a hrefhttpmccorp.comindex relnofollowhttpmccorp.comindexa is the site. Below is the navigation.php file that is calling the menu. None of the files called by loader.php have any menu information. The final goal is to move two of the submenu items under a different one and delete the one they were moved from. I feel like it is populating the menu from the database but the database pages table has nothing but the pages and I dont know what I might need to edit to change their order and location, none of the parentpageids correspond with their actual order or placement.

I tried using a session, but I dont know if I can insertremove and find items from a session, so I would prefer to use a collection.  However, if multiple users are using the website at the same time, I dont want the collection to recieve interference, so I want the collection to be unique to each visitor client side and temporary, like a sessonp  pso far, I have the following codep  pstrongtemplate to display vegetablesstrongp  precodelttemplate nameveggiesgt   ltulgt     each vegetables       ltli classif checkedcheckedifgt         ltinput typecheckbox checkedchecked classtogglechecked gt         ltspan classtextgtvegetableltspangt       ltligt     each   ltulgt lttemplategt  lttemplate namebuttongt   ltbutton classsubmitgtSugest recipesltbuttongt lttemplategt codepre  pstrongJavascript file code for the vegetablesstrongp  precodeRecipes  new Mongo.Collectionrecipes vegetables  new Mongo.Collectionvegetable   if Meteor.isClient     VEGGIES     this displays the vegetables   Template.veggies.helpers     vegetables function        return vegetables.find              this selects toggles the check mark   Template.veggies.events     click .togglechecked function         this.id, set checked  this.checked       var ItemID  this.id       Session.setselectedVeggies, ItemID     ,        this submits the request and reveals possible recipes   Template.button.events     click .submit function         Session.setPossibleRecipes, true         codepre  pSo  I need to know if there is a way to accomplish this task.

Negative 1967 pWe have conducted a conjoint survey of peoples preferences when shopping for salmon.  We have defined our salmon products in terms of price 20p steps from 3.60 to 5, ecocertification none, green statement and certified and Brand high, medium and low and have produced a csv file of our results with ecocertification and Brand coded as binary variables.p  pWe now wish to carry out a conjoint analysis on this data, to derive a model in the form probability choice  a price  b green statement  c certified  d high  e medium  error none and low are not included in the model as they are taken to be our base variables.  We then need to divide all our coefficients by a to derive a willingness to pay estimate, for which we will need to calculate the associated standard error.  Finally, we have a load of associated demographic data for each respondant gender, age etc.  We want to test whether males and females respond differently for example.  To do this, we know that we need to either generate 2 seperate models, or, the method we intend to pursue, include gender as an interaction term with each of the attributes in the model above.p  pWe are working in R, but having read through the conjoint package information it sounds like each respondant has to have been shown every possible choice, whereas each of our respondants chose between 3 different products for 4 repeats with different sets of 3 products.  I have also read through the m.logit pdf, but cannot work out from this what function I need to use, or whether our data is currently in the right format.  p  pPlease could you advise us a how to run the initial conjoint analysis and derive the stated model, b how to calculate the SE associated with the derived WTP estimate, and c how to then run the conjoint analysis again with the added interactions from the demographic variable  If it would be loads easier in STATA or another programme, we are open to switching.p  pMany thanks.p

Negative 1967 pHello I am trying to create an application using dropwizard framework. I have the DAO classes impl which needs an handle to connection manager instance which will then be used to get database connections. I have a multi tenant database application. This connection manager would be a custom implementation.p  pThe application uses hikari cp as connection pool and mysql database. I want to initialize the datasource and connection pool using dropwizard managed object feature. Once the datasource is initialized I want to inject the connection manager instance in each of dao classes using guice binding something likep  precodebindConnectionManager.class.toProviderConnectionManagerProvider.class codepre  pThen in each dao impl classesp  precodeInject public class UserDAOIpl extends AbstractDAO      protected UserDAOImplConnectionManager connectionManager          superconnectionManager       codepre  pI have looked everywhere on the net there is no particular example for my use case. Also there is a lack of documentation at dropwirzard.iop  pThis is more of an architectural design question rather than code question.p  pThe datasource module would be a separate module which would be used in many service. I am using maven as build tool.p  pMy questions arep  ol liHow I can approach this situation  Some class names and implementation guide lines would be very useful.li liThe application would be handing half a million requests a day. The solution should be feasible.li ol  pI look forward to community for any guidance or if any body can point me to some good resources.p  pNOTE We wont be using hibernate for this application and would be using JDBI.p

Negative 1967 pWe usually use message passing to send messages to decoupled services. This makes service discovery a nonissue, because with AMQP in RabbitMQ for instance you can use the brokers routing capability to dispatch messages to the right queues that feed the correct services. Load balancing is also handled by the message broker.p  pEnter kubernetes.p  pThe use case that is usually laid out when talking about service replication and respawning failing services, is when your clients use some active protocol like http to contact a service, even if this service handles requests asynchronously. In this context, it is a natural fit to have replication controllers, that manage a group of services and a single entry point to load balance between them.p  pI like kubernetes intuitive concepts, like rolling deployments, but how to you control this beasts that dont have an http interface p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I am not trying to set up a cluster of message brokers. I am looking at message consumers as services. Service clients dont connect directly to the services, they send messages to the message broker. The message broker acts as a load balancer in a way, and dispatches the messages to the subscribed queue consumers. These consumers implement the service.p  pMy question gravitates around the fact that most usage patterns in demos handle services that are called via http, and kubernetes does a good job here to create a service proxy for these services, and a replication controller. Is it possible to create replication controllers for my kind of service, which does not have a http interface per se, and have all the benefits of rolling updates, and minimum instancesp

When the drop down is no it hides the name field in the form.p  pI can achieve this with JS but it would be nice going forward to have this as a simple data annotation for the model.p  pE.g [HideFielddropdown, no]p  pThanks in advance p

Negative 1967 pI posted a question asking if there was a way to consolidate the initialization of typeahead.js  Bloodhound controls here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions30981411canmultipleinputseachusingtypeaheadjswithdifferentsourcesbeconsolidatCan multiple inputs each using typeahead.js with different sources be consolidateda.p  pI have around 10 inputs on a single page that will be typeaheadenabled and it seemed like that was going to call for a lot of somewhat repetitive code.p  pI came up with a solution of sorts that I posted as an answer, and it works  configuring another input was easy.  But I realized that I had fallen into the old Microsoft MFC function call style of having a lot of parameters that you may or may not need along with no clear indication of what the parameters are, betraying my 30 year career as a Visual C programmerp  pIve read through most of the documentation here a hrefhttpslearn.jquery.comaboutjquery relnofollowhttpslearn.jquery.comaboutjquerya but I still dont feel like I have a good sense of the best way to address my question.p  pAll of the sample code Ive seen contains only one typeahead element, but what is a good approach in the real world when you have a page with multiple typeahead elements or any other similar control that requires significant configurationp  pIm new to jQuery and would like to apply generally accepted practices as much as possible, so tips or reading suggestions would be much appreciated.p

Negative 1967 pSay you have a program in which strong2 pieces of old code do the same workstrong, except they do it in two different contexts one does it in a GUI, the other one in an API.

The GUI has to do some strongadditional workstrong compared to the API for instance in the GUI, each changes made must pass through the undoredo system, but not in the API since it does not use the undoredo.p  pSo say you can merge 80 of the behavior of your piece of code, but strongyoure left with 20 that must be specializedstrong for API vs GUI ie. cant be pooledmerged by definition.p  pHow would you solve thatp  pI thought about  p  ul licreating a common function in which specialized code would be injected via strongcallbacksstrong eg. functors   li lior creating a strongtemplatedstrong common function, calling other templated subfunctions.

The parametrization of the common templated function would assure that the correct subfunctions template specialization is called.li ul  pBut none of these solution satisfy mep  ul lippassing several callbacks to a function can really make its signature messy very quicklypli lipwith the second solution, when you start templating, you may end up templating the majority of the functions involved this depends of course on your code, but in my case this is an issue.pli ul  pstrongAny other idea anyonestrongp

Negative 1967 pThis is going to be complicated...at least to me.  Im still trying to master JQUERY, AJAX, and JSON.

Just know that the above SELECT has 1 or more OPTION values.p  pThis is followed by the content sectionp  precode ltdiv classrow idcompleteProfilegt      series of DIVS and TABLES  ltdivgt codepre  pInitially, the content section is hidden, so the user will only see the dropdown menup  precode completeProfile.hide codepre  pAnd now, the JQUERY...  This next piece of code is what I use when the user chooses a selection from the dropdown menu.  Every time they pick a new selection, queries rerun, and new content is displayed to the screen, unless they select a blank OPTION.p  precode serviceload.changefunction        var page  serviceload.val      if page             completeProfile.hide       else           .postapiprofileSearch.php,               page page          , function data               var obj  JSON.parsedata              portBody.empty              var htmlToInsert  obj.mapfunction item                   return lttrgtlttdgt  item.PORT  lttdgtlttdgt  item.NAME  lttrgt                            portBody.htmlhtmlToInsert                      I do several more .post to return data into specific tables           Take note of this next .post           .postapivesselSearch.php,               page page          , function data               var obj  JSON.parsedata              vesselinfo.empty              var htmlToInsert  obj.mapfunction item                   return lttrgtlttdgtlta href classeditVesselLink datatogglemodal datavessel  item.VESSELNAME  gtEditltagtlttdgtlttdgt  item.VESSELNAME  lttdgtlttrgt                                    after all the queries are ran, and the data is returned, now we show the content          completeProfile.show         codepre  pIn the vesselInfo portion above, there is section that prints a hyperlink with which you can click, and it opens a modal window.  This is for editing purpose.  This functions properly.p  pHere is where the issue lies.p  pBack in the content section, there is another hyperlink that opens a modal window to add a new vessel.p  precode lth3gtVesselslth3gt  lta href idvesselInfoLink datatogglemodalgtAdd Newltagt codepre  pThis opens an Add New Vessel modal.  In that modal there is a FORM with a button that reads like thisp  precode ltbutton typebutton idaddVesselSubmitgtAddltbuttongt codepre  pWhen this button is clicked, it sends the values entered by the user to a PHP script which updates a table.p  precodeaddVesselSubmit.clickfunction       var addservice  addservice.val     var addvessel  addvessel.val     .postapiaddInfo.php,          addservice addservice,         addvessel addvessel     , function data           here is where my problem lies         if data  0              alertVessel was not saved          else              alertVessel was saved              At this point, I need to rerun the main function above so that it shows the vessel that was added immediately to the content section without a page refresh                codepre  pSo in the code directly above, if the new record was successfully saved to the table, the whole content section should rerun without a page refresh, with the new record automatically showing in the vesselInfo section.p  pI think the code that is used to display the content needs to be turned into a main function that can be called when the addVesselSubmit is successful, but I am not sure how to proceed with that.p  pI hope I was clear in my request.  Just in case, to reiterate  I need to be able to save a new record, and print the new record to the page without a page refresh.p  pFrom one developer to many others, thank you for taking a look.p

Negative 1967 pIve written an iOS application which connects to a BLE device and exchanges  data in background.

Negative 1967 pI am building a UI where I want to display the log size of a kafka topic and how much each consumer has read. I can read the consumer offsets from zookeeper. What would be the efficient way to get the log size of a topic. I might need to update the details say every 10 seconds.  I can get the log size from jmx or using a simple consumer and latest offset time. Is this the best available options or Is there any other efficient optionp
