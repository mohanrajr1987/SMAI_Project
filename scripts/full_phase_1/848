Positive 848 pHow would one solve this p  pAn application has a form with a password and other input fields.

The URL used in the render is the same as the POST URL. After the user logs out, someone else could use the browser back button and resubmit the form while using a tool like firebug to inspect the POST parameters and gain access to the users password.p  pThere is also a requirement to persist the users input from the form back to the page that displays the validation errors. So a simple redirect with error message in the flash would fail this requirement.p  pThe proposed solution is to use the a hrefhttpsgrails.github.iograilsdoclatestrefControllerschain.html relnofollowchaina method to put the command object into the flash scope so a redirect is possible to display errors and user input. This prevents someone from accessing the POST URL, and thus the password,  in browser tools.p  precodevoid submitActionFooCommand command     ifcommand.hasErrors     chainaction show, model [commandcommand]redirect instead of render  else do save and redirect  codepre  pOne potential downside is storing command objects in the flash scope ultimately the session that might have eagerly fetched relationships in the command.

How could we create a query like p  precodevar q  from customer in m.Customer         select new                                         customer.Number,             customer.City,             customer.CountryEntity.Name                       codepre  pfrom strings only. We would have 1 string called customer so we know we have to retrieve from Customer. Then we would have a string[] containing the fieldnames we want to retrieve. As you can see these columns could include complex types related fields.p  pAny advice, especially in combination with LLBLGen, would be greatp  pThanks, Gabp

Negative 848 pI have a function that accepts an anonymous function as an argument and sets it to a variable scoped for reference.  I then try to execute another function with that reference but it obviously fails since that function is out of scope.p  pI was wondering if anyone knew of a simple way of passing the anonymous function straight through as an anonymous function, avoiding the scoping issuep  pstrongEDITstrong To clarify, the el element is defined after the function is isolated from the arguments list.  Additionally, the el element is a part of the arguments list as well.

Negative 848 pI am using a codedijit.form.FilteringSelectcode backed by a codedojox.data.QueryReadStorecode in order to allow the user to select a region think autocomplete mechanism.  On each character entered by the user, the codeQueryReadStorecode sends a request to the server, awaiting a json list of matching regions with associated IDs.  By the time a short enough list is shown, the user picks the desired item.  [Admittedly, querying on every keystroke is not the most efficient pattern, but its good enough for now.]p  pUnexpected behaviour  in some rare but specific occasions, the choice made by the user doesnt stick.  For instance, if the user types codecancode, she is presented with the following choices in that orderp  precodeAtlantic Canada Canada English Canada Lower Canada Upper Canada Western Canada codepre  pIf she chooses codeCanadacode among these, the dijit closes the drop down selection, having correctly selected her choice.  But by the time the user leaves the field, the selection switches to codeAtlantic Canadacodep  pThat bizarre phenomenon occurs systematically for a small number of specific regions.  At first, I thought that the common factor between those badly behaved regions was that their name contained accented characters or hyphens, but clearly not so with the Canadian example.  So far, I fail to spot a regular pattern.p  pI have not found any mention of a similar problem anywhere.  I am quite willing to investigate, but, as I am new to dojo, I would really appreciate pointers before I resort to delving inside dojos code  where should I first look  what are some likely problems that could cause that behaviour can i rule out certain hypotheses how should I best use the console or Firebug to get to the bottom of this  etc.p  pThe problem occurs with both dojo 1.1.1 and dojo 1.2.3.p  pHere is the programmatic generation of the codeFilteringSelectcodep  precodenew dijit.form.FilteringSelect    name  region    autoComplete  false    hasDownArrow  false    labelAttr  name    queryExpr  0    store  new dojox.data.QueryReadStoreurlqueryregions , myNode codepre  pstrongEDIT 20090218 Additional detailsstrongp  pFollowing damelins answer, I wanted to understand what codeFilteringSelectcode saw of this situation.  Suppose I connect logging functions to the codeFilteringSelectcodes events codeonChangecode and codeonBlurcode, I get the following playbyplay sequencep  ul liI click in the field and type codecancodeli lidropdown list of 6 regions listed above appearsli liwith the keyboard cursors, I move down the list to codeCanadacode which is region with id 1li lipI press codeEntercode thus strongselectingstrong an item of the store.  The dropdown list has by now disappeared and the text codeCanadacode appears in the field.  At this point, the first event is fired, with the following loggingp  precodeonChange event region 1 codepreli lipI leave the field by pressing codetabcode.  Here, two events are fired one after the other, in the following orderp  precodeonBlur event region 1 onChange event region 246 codepreli ul  pRegion 246 is codeAtlantic Canadacode. Now thats very interesting...  By the time I leave the field onBlur, codeCanadacode still is the selected value.  The mysterious swap happens only after that...p

Negative 848 pA while back I asked a question about TransactionScope escalating to MSDTC when I wasnt expecting it to. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1690892transactionscopeautomaticallyescalatingtomsdtconsomemachinesPrevious questionap  pWhat it boiled down to was, in SQL2005, in order to use a TransactionScope, you can only instance and open a single SqlConnection within the life of the TransactionScope.  With SQL2008, you can instance multiple SqlConnections, but only a single one can be open at any given time.  SQL2000 will always escalate to DTC...we dont support SQL2000 in our application, a WinForms app, BTW.p  pOur solution to singleconnectiononly problem was to create a TransactionScope helper class, called LocalTransactionScope aka LTS.  It wraps a TransactionScope and, most importantly, creates and maintains a single SqlConnection instance for our application. The good news is, it works  we can use LTS across disparate pieces of code and they all join the ambient transaction.  Very nice.  The trouble is, every emrootem LTS instance created will create and effectively kill a connection from the connection pool.  By Effectively Kill I mean it will instance a SqlConnetion, which will open a emnewem connection for whatever reason, it never reuses a connection from the pool, and when that root LTS is disposed, it closes and disposes the SqlConnection which is supposed to release the connection back to the pool so that it can be reused, however, it clearly never is reused. The pool bloats until its maxed out, and then the application fails when a maxpoolsize1 connection is established. p  pBelow Ive attached a stripped down version of the LTS code and a sample console application class that will demonstrate the connection pool exhaustion.  In order to watch your connection pool bloat, use SQL Server Managment Studios Activity Monitor or this query p  precodeSELECT DBNAMEdbid as DB Name, COUNTdbid as Connections FROM sys.sysprocesses WITH nolock WHERE dbid gt 0 GROUP BY dbid codepre  pIm attaching LTS here, and a sample console application that you can use to demonstrate for yourself that it will consume connections from the pool and never reuse nor release them. You will need to add a reference to System.Transactions.dll for LTS to compile.p  pThings to note Its the rootlevel LTS that opens and closes the SqlConnection, which always opens a new connection in the pool.  Having nested LTS instances makes no difference because only the root LTS instance establishes a SqlConnection.  As you can see, the connection string is always the same, so it emshouldem be reusing the connections.  p  pstrongIs there some arcane condition were not meeting that causes the connections not to be reused Is there any solution to this other than turning pooling off entirelystrongp  precodepublic sealed class LocalTransactionScope  IDisposable        private static SqlConnection Connection            private TransactionScope TransactionScope       private bool IsNested            public LocalTransactionScopestring connectionString                  stripped out a few cases that need to throw an exception          TransactionScope  new TransactionScope            well use this later in Dispose... to determine whether this LTS instance should close the connection.          IsNested  Connection  null           if Connection  null                       Connection  new SqlConnectionconnectionString               This Has CodeStink.  You want to open your connections as late as possible and hold them open for as little              time as possible.  However, in order to use TransactionScope with SQL2005 you can only have a single               connection, and it can only be opened once within the scope of the entire TransactionScope.  If you have              more than one SqlConnection, or you open a SqlConnection, close it, and reopen it, it more than once,               the TransactionScope will escalate to the MSDTC.  SQL2008 allows you to have multiple connections within a               single TransactionScope, however you can only have a single one open at any given time.               Lastly, lets not forget about SQL2000.  Using TransactionScope with SQL2000 will immediately and always escalate to DTC.              Weve dropped support of SQL2000, so thats not a concern we have.

Negative 848 pi have a website where i provicde a link. On clicking the link a controller action method is called to generate a zip file after creation of zip file is done, i show the link to download the zip file by replacing the link to create a zip with the link to download the zip.p  pthe problem is that after zip file creation is over and link is shown, when user clicks on the link to download the zip file, they are sent to login. After providing correct credentials in the login page they are prompted to download the zip file. they sould not be sent to the login page. In the action to generate zip file i havent abondoned the session or havent not done anything that abondons the session.p  pthe user should not be sent to login page after successful creation of zip file user should be able to download the file without login.p  pi search internet on this problem, but i did not find any solution.

Negative 848 pduring the past couple of years a lot of our internal APIs for modifying and searching our database have become more and more entangled with the specific needs and application logic of the front ends that they power. To counter that trend weve decided to gradually move those APIs to web services with stable and concisely specified interfaces. Another reason for this step is that the APIs were initially designed for traditional websites while they are now more and more being used by AJAX applications, iPhone apps, external customers an so on.p  pWhile working out the details of this process weve realized that one of the major functionalities that we plan on providing are fairly complex searches through various types of resources like, for example, people, documents and locations.p  pNow, it is obvious that the details of a search largely depend on the search space. There are, however, a lot of metaconcepts that are universal. For instance, logical operators connecting search predicates and a hierarchical structure braces and precedence rules for these operations range queries for numeric values, regular expression matching for strings, and so on. Given these concepts, XML immediately comes to mind as an adequate representation for a query so do DSLs, but I think that is too big of a gun in our case.p  pSo my question is this is there an XML meta language on which we can base our own, domainspecific dialect for expression such queries Or are there other possibilities which have so far not crossed our mindsp

Negative 848 pWeak hash tables like a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavautilWeakHashMap.html relnofollowJavas weak hash mapa use weak references to track the collection of unreachable keys by the garbage collector and remove bindings with that key from the collection. Weak hash tables are typically used to implement indirections from one vertex or edge in a graph to another because they allow the garbage collector to collect unreachable portions of the graph.p  pIs there a purely functional equivalent of this data structure If not, how might one be createdp  pThis seems like an interesting challenge. The internal implementation cannot be pure because it must collect i.e. mutate the data structure in order to remove unreachable parts but I believe it could present a pure interface to the user, who could never observe the impurities because they only affect portions of the data structure that the user can, by definition, no longer reach.p

Negative 848 pThink a shopping basket with some goods in it. I have a codeltligtcode list of elements and each of them has a field containing a number  the amount.p  pConceptually this is what i want When the user presses a button, i loop through each codeltligtcode element picking the amount. Then i do a .Get to call the server with the goods id  the amount to check if the store has enough of the particular item.  The server replies either True og False. This reply is temporary stored in a html field. Now after the looping is done, i check if there were a False reply on any of the goods. If so i highlight the false items. Or else i simply submit.p  pOK, the problem is that my code seams to continue past my .get callback function, so the final check to see if any false was returned is evaluated before the .get actually receives a result from the server. Anyway this is what i think is happening...p  pNow lets look at some codep  precodevar tmp  new Array var id   var c   var n  0 var z0 basket.findli.list.eachfunction  c  this.findinput.fldamount.val   this is the amount field id  this.attrid   this is the id no of the item .get.RPCOpenAgentampcmdmovewhcheckamountampunididampcountc, functiondata      RPCResult.valdata   i store the returned value in a html field     if  RPCResult.val  true         tmp.push idc    if true is returned, i push the id amp amount to an array      else        this.addClassred   else i tag the item       nn1   and then increment a counter          basket  var t  window.setTimeout function    if tmp.length gt 0 ampamp n  0     if i got items in the array AND my false counter is zero     SelectedArtikler.val tmp.join    then i store the array as text in a field     document.FlyttArtikel.submit   and submit    else if n gt 0       show a popup     alertYoure trying to move more items than exists...    else      alertops, nothing to move...   should never end up here...    , 1000 window.clearTimeoutt codepre  pAs you can see, i have tried to counteract the code running past my callback function with a setTimeout, so that i basically wait a sec to give the server time to respond. I did have another loop around the setTimeout the continued as long as my RPCResult field was empty, but that resulted in an infinite loop.p  pI have the RPCResult field visible so i can see what happens and what i see is that the popup Youre trying to move more items... is shown and RIGTH AFTER i press ok on that popup THEN the RPCResult field gets the result truefalse.p  pI now some of the code can be optimized but what im interested in right now is getting the .get result in a proper fashion.p  pThanks in advance p

I think my error is when i name the checkboxes, I named for each row p  pThe event1 checkbox I named codeevent1[]codebr The event2 checkbox I named codeevent2[]codebr The event3 checkbox I named codeevent3[]codebrp  p...and this was repeated a 100 times. When I submit the form, I wrote in the postsubmit.php file the followingp  precodeevent1[]  POST[event1] event2[]  POST[event2] event3[]  POST[event3] codepre  pWhich is apparently wrong as it doesnt work.p  pWhat happens is, when i check some checkboxes and then submit the form, its always the first couple of records in my db that gets updated, if i check the LAST checkbox for event1, and i go to my database and it was only the event1 field for the first record which got updated. Im doing something wrong here, and im guessing its something to do with the information I have provided above. Can somebody please help.

Negative 848 pI have taken over an Android project from a past employee and am wondering if there is an easy tool to use for profiling an Android application. I have a LinearLayout with a ProgressBar spinner inside of it. Now I am running a network call on a different thread while that spinner is showing. I use a translate animation to show the entire LinearLayout and when the network call returns on the other thread I hide the LinearLayout. Now this works great but I see that the spinner kind of stops spinning while it is showing. Now it kind of looks like if I interact with the screen, such as trying to scroll, the spinner will continue to spin. For a standard ProgressBar spinner do I need to set some command on the spinner to keep it spinning Any information on this would be great.p  pThanksp

Negative 848 pI am using the codectypescode module in python to load a shared clibrary , which contains thread local storage. Its a quite large clibrary with a long history, that we are trying to make thread safe. The library contains lots of global variables and statics, so our initial strategy towards thread safety has been to use thread local storage. We want our libarary to be platform independent, and have been compiling and testing thread safety on both win32, win64 and 64bit Ubuntu. From a pure cprocess there doesnt seem to be any problems.  p  pstrongHowever in python 2.6 and 2.7 on win32 and on Ubuntu we are seeing memory leaks.strong It seems like the thread local storage is not being released properly when a python thread terminates. Or at least that somehow the python process is not aware about that the memory is freed. The same problem is also seen in a cprogram on win32 actually, but it is not present on our win64 server test machine running python 2.7 also.p  pThe problem can be reproduced with a simple toy example like thisp  pCreate a cfile containing on codelinuxunixcode remove codedeclspecdllexportcodep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt void declspecdllexport Leakerint tid     static thread double leaky[1024]     static thread int init0     if init           printfThread d initializing., tid           int i           for i0ilt1024i leaky[i]i           init1     else         printfThis is thread dn,tid     return codepre  pCompile wit codeMINGWcode on windowsgcc on linux likep  pcodegcc o leaky.dllcode or codeleaky.socode codeshared thefile.ccodep  pOn windows we could have compiled with Visual Studio, replacing codethreadcode with codedeclspecthreadcode. However on win32 up to winXP I believe, this does not work if the library is to be loaded in runtime with codeLoadLibrarycode.p  pNow create a python program likep  precodeimport threading, ctypes, sys, time NRUNS1000 KEEPALIVE5 REPEAT2 libctypes.cdll.LoadLibraryleaky.dll lib.Leaker.argtypes[ctypes.cint] lib.Leaker.restypeNone def UseLibrarytid,repetitions     for i in rangerepetitions         lib.Leakertid         time.sleep0.5 def main     finishedthreads0     while finishedthreadsltNRUNS         if threading.activeCountltKEEPALIVE             finishedthreads1             threadthreading.ThreadtargetUseLibrary,argsfinishedthreads,REPEAT             thread.start     while threading.activeCountgt1         printActive threads i threading.activeCount         time.sleep2     return if namemain     sys.exitmain codepre  pThat is enough to reproduce the error. Explicitly import the garbage collector, doing a codecollect gc.collectcode when starting each new thread does not help.p  pFor a while I thought that the problem had to do with incompatible runtimes python compiled with Visual Studio, my library with codeMINGWcode.

Negative 848 pI have an Android app, in which Activities fire long running operations that run in the background. These operations interact with the  Activities when done. Im developing a component that handles the ActivityLongRunningTask coupling, taking care of  activities being  destroyed and recreated.p  pRight now that component is implemented as an Android service. The activities call bindService and use the resulting IBinder to start and track tasks. I decided against using startService, because I prefer the richer API possible through a Java interface.p  pNow the problem. Activity A start ups, binds to the service and calls serviceApi.runTask.... Activity A is then destroyed because the user flips the phone, for instance and recreated as Activity A. A then binds again to the service, announces its existence and everything should be running nicely.p  pExcept that my Service gets destroyed. When Activity A is destroyed, it unbinds from the service. Android sees there are no more clients, and  kills the service. When Activity A is created, the service is created again, and I lose everything the  old service had.p  pThe only solution I can see is using a singleton for the service. And then it doesnt really have to be an Android service, just an instance thats accessible to everyone. Is that frowned upon in Android Is there a better design that fits this problemp  hr  pEditted Even if I call startService and then bind to it, nothing guarantees that the service instance will exist as long as the application is running. Android can kill sticky services if resources are low. Killing the service will cause the application to malfunction, and I cant have that.p

Negative 848 pRecently, I have come up with some idea about how to improve the overall performance for a web application in that instead of generating a readytoshow html page from the web server, why not let it be fully generated in the client side.  Doing it this way, only pure data in my case is data in JSON format needs to be sent to the browser.  This will offload the work of html generation from the server to the clients browser and reduce the size of the response packet sent back to users.p  pAfter some research, I have found that this framework httpbeeboleapps.compure does the same thing as mine.p  pWhat I want to know is the pros and cons of doing it this way. It is surely faster and better for web servers and with modern browser, Javascript code can run fast so page generation can be done fast. p  pWhat should be a downside for this method is probably for SEO. I am not sure if search engines like Google will appropriately index my website. strongCould you tell me what the downside for this method isstrong  p  pPs I also attached sample code to help describe the method as followsp  pIn the head, simple javascript code will be written like thisp  precodeltscript typejavascript srchtmlgenerator.jsgt ltscriptgt    function onPageLoad       htmlGeneratedata.val      ltscriptgt codepre  pIn the body, only one element exist, used merely as a data container as follows p  precode  ltinput typehidden iddata valuea 1, b 2, c 3gt  codepre  pWhen the browser renders the file, htmlGenerate function which is in htmlgenerator.js will be called and the whole html page will be generated in this function. Note that the htmlgenerator.js file can be large since it contains a lot of html templates but since it can be cached in the browser, it will be downloaded once and only once.p

I did this with MessageBox.Show after joining the two elements and it pops up the message box 3 times, 1 for each of the three items selected.p  pNow I am using Mutex to only allow it to run once but I only get the first message box as expected.p  pHow can I get all the items listed in one instance if I select more than one Itemp  pHere is the code without mutexp  precodestatic void Main              String[] args  Environment.GetCommandLineArgs         var message  string.Join, , args         MessageBox.Showmessage      codepre  pAnd here it is with Mutexp  precodestatic void Main              Mutex startOnlyOne  new Mutexfalse, WinSyncSingalInstanceMutx         if startOnlyOne.WaitOne0, false                      String[] args  Environment.GetCommandLineArgs             var message  string.Join, , args             MessageBox.Showmessage             startOnlyOne.Close          codepre  pNo one has been able to help me out with this yet, I hope someone can help me figure this out.

Im not sure how to go about setting up injection for the IQueryEntities interface so that it will reuse an existing DbContext instance that may have already been injected against the IUnitOfWork interface. Or vice versa.

Am I doing something wrong When I dont give each interface the lifetime manager, one HttpContext ends up with multiple instances of the DbContext.

Negative 848 pIve solved 45 problems from 4clojure.com and I noticed a recurring problem in the way I try to solve some problems using recursion and accumulators.p  pIll try to explain the best I can what Im doing to end up with fugly solutions hoping that some Clojurers would get what Im not getting.p  pFor example, problem 34 asks to write a function without using emrangeem taking two integers as arguments and creates a range without using range.

Negative 848 pDoes anybody know the correct formula to get the saturation level from an RGB colorp  pI already have a function that does it. Ive tried loads of them posted on the internet but only this one seemed to work firsttime for me, apart from the saturation level being occasionally slightly out.p  pcodergb204,153,51code should equal codehsl40,60,50code, instead I have codehsl40,75,50code.

Negative 848 pI have a problem with Devise in production mode. Everything works fine in development users can subscribe, log in and log out without problems.  When running in production mode, users can register successfully the first time, but if they logout then they are not able to login and the invalide email or password message is always returned.p  pIn particular the problem seems to arise as cacheclassestrue in production mode.p  pIve searched a lot and my guess is that there is some caching going on that prevents devise to look for the password in the db. Btw the password is correctly saved in the db after the user registration.p  pUnfortunately, Ive not been able to solve the problem and Im running out of ideas.

Negative 848 pIve developed an app using a MapView  when the app starts up, it asks the user to allow their location to be accessedused without any coding from me.

Negative 848 pIm trying to do simple rotations in Objective C and there are a couple problems right off the bat. One thing is the inconsistency I get from a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationGraphicsImagingReferenceCGAffineTransformReferencereference.htmlapplerefcfuncCGAffineTransformRotate relnofollowCGAffineTransformRotatea and how MPI is inconsistent when used inside that function.p  pSuppose I do this, and attach it to a button. When I press it once it will rotate 180 degrees counterclockwise good and follows the documentation but when I press it again, it will rotate 180 emclockwiseem even though the value is not negative. Changing MPI to MPI does the exact same thing with no differences in the rotationp  precode[UIView animateWithDurationsecs delay0.0 optionsoption    animations       self.transform  CGAffineTransformRotateself.transform, MPI   Inconsistent  completionnil] codepre  pNow suppose I changed MPI to 3.141593, which is the value that MPI contains when I print it. Now, when I press the button, it works completely fine. Both times, itll rotate 180 degrees counter clockwise.

But as far as I understood this approach works only with one element, and I need access to at least two of them.p  pAlso notice that content element is template that is constantly changed by this animation.p  pPlease help if you have any ideas about it. p

Negative 848 pIm trying to link my application with a static library built in a different version of Visual Studio Im using VS2010 and the lib is built with VS2008.  The static lib uses STL internally and Im getting linker errors that some basicstring methods cannot be found.p  pI understand that if the static lib uses STL in its public interface then this is impossible, since the STL objects are binarily incompatible.  But this is not the case.  None of the methods from the lib that I am calling use STL and I am passing no STL objects to the lib.  But internally the static lib uses STL in its own functions.  p  pIt looks like the library does not have the STL code compiled into it, and the linker is trying to link the STL into the internal methods.  My question is is there any way to compile the static lib to statically link against the STL and include all the code inside of itp  pI should mention that my own application also uses STL.  But it seems that both versions could be compiled in provided that they are never passed to each other.p

Negative 848 pIve got a UIPopoverController created programmatically which pops up with the content from a UIViewController from a .xib. The UIViewController contains a grouped UITableView and a UITableViewCell prototype. When The popover pops up, the cell prototype is duplicated for all cells needed. The number of cells exceeds the size of the popover, so I can scroll through all cells.p  pWhen the popover pops up, everything looks nice, the cell labels are all left aligned. As soon as I touch the tableview to scroll, all cell labels suddenly align to center. When I scroll the cells outside and back in, the are left aligned again. After I scrolled all cells outside for once, they keep left aligned for the rest of their lifetime. I have no idea what is causing this... there is nothing in my code that alters the alignment of the cells.

Negative 848 pIm having some issues. I have a cocos2d game Im just about done developing. However Ive run into a problem where I need to enable portrait orientation in my apps plist for game center sign in to work without throwing a SIGABRT error. So once I enable that from my apps build summary page Or add it to the info.plist file as a supported orientation it works fine. But then anytime in my game if you turn the iPhone it will flip to portrait mode if it senses you turned it that way. Ive tried messing with the shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation method from my AppDelegate.m and its not getting called AT ALL, not at any time is it being called. I threw an NSLog statement in the method to be sure if its being called, and its not.p  pSo, basically my real issue is.

Negative 848 blockquote   pstrongPossible Duplicatestrongbr   a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4911926declaringaglobalvariableinmatlabDeclaring a global variable in MATLABa  p blockquote    pCurrently my matlab code is in one big script file with no internal functions. I would like to have functions declared within my script, to make my code more readable and reuse code etc. This in itself is not difficult in matlab, e.g.p  pExample 1p  precodefunction main   myfuncgoat end  function myfuncx   fprintfx end codepre  pMy problem is that I have a biig datafile, which I want to load only once, such that I can rerun my code during development without spending time on reloading the data. This is not a problem in my current framework with one big script with no internal functions. One solution is to have two matlab script files. One for loading data and then calling the functions in another script.p  pHowever in the above example 1 a true global variable declaration will not work, and I am forced load the biig file every time I run the script. What I would like to do can be shown in two examplesp  pExample 2p  precode Global variable if existdata,var    data  load biigdatafile.mat  FAILS, outside function. end  function main   myfuncgoat end  function myfuncx   fprintfx end codepre  pExample 3p  precodefunction main    Global variable   if existdata,var     global data      Is not really global after whole script is completed.     data  load biigdatafile.mat   end   myfuncgoat end  function myfuncx   fprintfx end codepre  pSo my question is how to declare a true global variable as in example 2, where I load my data once to stay in workspace, while calling my functions inside one scriptp

Negative 848 pIm writing a game in which players write AI agents that compete against one another, on the JVM. Right now the architecture looks like thisp  ol liA core server module that handles the physics simulations, and takes messages from the players as input to alter the world. The core also determines what the world looks like from the perspective of each of the players, based on various rules think fog of war.li liPlayer modules receive updated versions of the world from the core, process them, and stream messages to the core as inputs based on that processing.li ol  pThe idea is that the core is compiled along with two player modules, and then the simulation is run producing an output stream that can be played back to generate visualization of the match.p  pMy question is, if each of the players runs on a single Java thread, is it possible to ensure that the two player threads get equal amounts of resources CPU time, primarily, I think Because I dont control the nature of the processing that each AI is doing, its possible that one of the players might be extremely inefficient but written in such a way that its thread consumes so many resources the other players AI is resource starved and cant compete fairly.p  pI get the feeling that this isnt possible without a hard realtime OS, which the JVM isnt even close to being, but if theres even a way to get reasonably close Id love to explore it. p

However we are thinking to add 2 factor authentication to the ADFS not only on browser based passive profile basically customize the login page, but also active profile such as end point servicestrust13UsernameMixed. The only approach I could think of is to intercept the request into the ADFS server, I heard that ADFS end points are WCF end points, however I did not see a configuration file at ADFS folder the installation is at the cwindowsADFS at my 2012 server. Otherwise, I am thinking to use WCF behavior extension maybe some other approach if you know to intercept the request, however so far I didnt see how I could do that. I am new to ADFSWCF, any insight on this would be highly appreciated. Maybe I am trying to attempt something which is impossible.p  pAt this point, we dont really want to use another STS to let ADFS federate with it. It would be too big a change at customer ADFS env.

Negative 848 pI am making a deck of cards in Adobe Illustrator.  Each card is saved as its own .ai file so I can change it later if I want to.  When using these images in an iOS app, I must convert everything to .png files.  Then I must resize those .png files to have retina and non retina versions.  Im hoping there is a way that will allow me to automatically take a folder of all my .ai files and give .pngs of 200px x 400px and 100 x 200px.  Also Id like the larger ones to automatically be named 2xNameOfOrginalFile.png and the others to be named nameOfOrginalFile.png.

Negative 848 pMy ideal image processing library for android just provides a means to load images into memory in a standard format without any extra lossiness as it is loaded from the filecamera and then allows me to painlessly call my own C or C routines that operate on that format and finally allows me to save the result in a standard format to a file possibly with loss, e.g. jpeg .

I think the nature of the algorithm doesnt matter here, so I wont give much explanation about the way it works. What I think matter though, is that it uses 3dimensional arrays, whose all three dimensions are dynamically allocated. I use VS2010, with CUDA 5.0. And my device is a 2.1. The original hostonly code can be downloaded here  a hrefhttpfiles.getwebb.orgviewcre62u4d.html relnofollowhttpfiles.getwebb.orgviewcre62u4d.htmlap  pMain points of the codep  ol lipatterns from adult.data are loaded into memory, using the Data structure, present in pattern.h.li liseveral multidimensional arrays are allocatedli lithe algorithm is ran over the patterns, using the arrays allocated just before.li ol  pIf you want to try to run the code dont forget to modify the PATH constant at the beginning of kernel.cu. I also advise you to use 2 layers, 5 neurons, and a learning rate of 0.00001. As you can see, this work perfectly. The MSE is improving. For those who have no clue about what does this algorithms, lets simply say that it learns how to predict a target value, based on 14 variables present in the patterns. The MSE decrease, meaning that the algorithm makes less mistakes after each epoch.p  pI spent a really long time trying to run this code on the device. And Im still unsuccessful. Last attempt was done by simply copying the code initializing the arrays and running the algorithm into a big kernel. Which failed again. This code can be downloaded there  a hrefhttpfiles.getwebb.orgviewcre62u4c.html relnofollowhttpfiles.getwebb.orgviewcre62u4c.htmlap  pTo be precise, here are the differences with the original hostonly codep  ul lif and fder, which are used by the algorithm, become strongdevicestrong functions.li liparameters are hardcoded 2 layers, 5 neurons, and a learning rate of 0.00001li lithe w array is initialized using a fixed value 0.5, not rand anymoreli lia Data structure is allocated in devices memory, and the data are sent in devices memory after they have been loaded from adult.data in hosts memoryli ul  pI think I did the minimal amount of modifications needed to make the code run in a kernel.

Negative 848 pI have a a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netVabzX relnofollowjsFiddlea with Droppable1 accepting Draggable1 and Droppable2 accepting Draggable2. It uses a codehandlercode and is set to coderevertcode on invalid.p  pHowever, strongId like the droppables to react on attempt to drop incorrect draggables on themstrong. So, for example, when you drop Draggable1 on Droppable2, the color of Droppable2 should become the color of Draggable1 and additionally, Draggable1 should coderevertcode back as normal. Ive no idea how to do it, because all droppable events are fired only when something is done to accepted draggable, not to unaccepted one.p  pTheoretically I could make the droppable accept both draggables, then change the color on drop event. But in such case the coderevertcode effect on invalid will be lost, because dropping Draggable1 on Droppable2 will be valid.p  pIs there any way to achieve itp

Negative 848 pIm doing some text mining using the excellent scikitlearn module. Im trying to cluster and classify scientific abstracts.p  pIm looking for a way to cluster my set of tfid representations, without having to specify the number of clusters in advance. I havent been able to find a good algorithm that can do that, and still handle large sparse matrixes decently. I have been looking into simply using scikitlearns kmeans, but it doesnt have a way to determine the optimal number of clusters for example using BIC. I have also tried using the gaussian mixture models using the best BIC score to select the model, but they are awfully slow.p  pAfter I have clustered the documents, I would like to be able to look into the topics of each cluster, meaning the words they tend to use. Is there a way to extract this information, given the data matrix and clusterlabels Maybe taking the mean of the cluster and inverse transforming it using the tfidvectorizer Ive previously tried to use chisquare and randomforest to rank feature importance, but that doesnt say which labelclass uses what.p  pIve tried using the NMF decomposition method using simply the example code from scikitlearns website to do topic detection. It worked great, and produced very meaningful topics very quickly. However, i did not find a way of using it to assign each datapoint to a cluster, nor automatically determine the optimal number of clusters. But its the sort of thing im looking for.p  pI also read somewhere that its possible to extract topic information directly from a fitted LDA model, but i dont understand how its done. Since I already have implemented an LDA as a baseline classifier and visualisation tool, this might be an easy solution.p  pIf I manage to produce meaningful clustertopics, I am going to compare them to some human made labels not topic based, to see how they correspond. But thats a topic for another thread p

Negative 848 pIve got a uiviewcontroller with a scrollview in it and a few uiswitches in a blank test project to examine this problem. When I first push it it takes a third of a meg of memory and I dont get that memory back when I unload it. Subsequent loads dont take any further memory but I am unhappy about this wasted half meg, as I want to add more viewcontrollers and this is wasted memory as they might be used once in the early stages of using the app and then not for the rest of the several hours the app might be used. p  pSo whats going on, is the OS caching the viewcontroller or its controls If I strip it down to just a viewcontroller it only hogs about 20k post unload. Add 5 uiswitches and properties and nothing changes but when I connect them up to their properties and it goes up to 300k and with a further 5 controls goes up to about 550k. p  pIm setting them to nil in viewDidUnload, and nilling and releasing them in dealloc, and dealloc is being called on the unload. But despite this I am not getting the memory back. They are declared as properties not ivars, relying on automatic ivar creation and authsynthesised, and Im not directly accessing the ivars apart from in dealloc with release. Theres no reported memory leaks in analyse or instruments. Just this first time memory raid after which the viewcontrollers appetite for my users ram seems saited.p  pIn instruments none of my code is referred to on the stack trace apart from main and most of the loitering garbage seems to be from UIKit and similar.p  pAs I say my only suspicion that I can think of is that ios is trying to be clever and imagining I am going to reuse this stuff sometime but its simply a total waste of memory in my final app this will be taking at least 10 meg in total at this rate. If this is Apples choice is there a way to override it and force the memory to be returned to me p  pThanks in advance for any pointers this is driving me nuts.p

I have checked and every single time I change the port it happens again it happens when the firewall is down, when I dont shut down the firewall it doesnt even receive a single request.p  pI have a message showing when there is a connection through the port 4567 and couple seconds after I start my server app it shows that there is a connection from a similar IP than the one I have assigned and I havent yet run my android app.  I configured the endpoints, and I even shut down the firewall and it is giving the same issue. The client app and the server app are working perfectly if I run the server on my local machine. Help would be really appreciated, thanks in advance.p

Negative 848 pIve set up NewRelic for a rails application on Heroku. I notice NewRelic is determining the application name from the rails environment definition. This is mediated through the appname variable in the newrelic.yml configuration file. However, I run the same rails environment on disparate Heroku applications, each being used for different development testing or staging purposes. So we entirely emdo notem want all those applications although using the same rails environment to report back to the same NewRelic application. That would provide no value at all in NewRelic  rather, each Heroku application should be its own application in NewRelic, otherwise we just get one useless aggregate for all those applications each running a different source version of our application with different load or test simulations. p  pWhat should be the most straightforward and solid way to configure that separationp  pThanksp  pemP.S. of course for our production environment we do want to have all dynos report back as one NewRelic application.

Negative 848 pI have a typical use case in my current project. I want my client to be able to edit only pictures in the WordPress site I am building for them. They should not be able to edit any text whatsoever, anywhere on the site.p  pI thought of two different paths to take  1. Use jQuery to edit the images from the front end, but I dont know how I will save the changes to database given that the entire post content is in one place on the WordPress DB. 2. Disable text editing in the TinyMCE for that particular role, so the user can only open up posts in the TinyMCE and can change only the images using the Add Media button.p  pWhich path would you take among these two And if there is another better solution, please guide me to it.p

Negative 848 pIm in the middle of developing a web application and have been asked the question whether it will work with a load balancer. My initial reaction is yes, since there is no state tracked between requests anywhere in the system. However, there is some application specific state loaded on app start configuration settings from the database mainly.p  ol lipThis data is all Read Only. Is it sufficient to rely on the normal cache dependency mechanisms to manage this and invalidate these objects across all the applications in the cluster or would I have to move to a shared cache system like App Fabric to ensure reliabilityconsistencypli lipWith diagnostics enabled, Ive got numerous logging calls using EventSource.Write and an out of process logger picking these up. I assume in this case, Id need one logger installed on each of the servers in the cluster to pick up the events each one triggers. Im not too fussed about that, but what is a good way to identify which server in the cluster serviced the requestpli ol

Negative 848 pI have a UI in C that loads a C Dll which contains the code of some process. So the C has an interface to communicate with the C dll using DllImport.p  pNow I would like to use the same C UI but with a different C Dll which will have the same function call but totally different process inside. So basically, in function of some parameters, my UI will load one or the other C DLL.

Negative 848 pI need to account for the different orientations a device can be in. Aka landscape, landscape flipped, portrait, or portrait flipped.

Negative 848 pI asked this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq20055350624479questiona yesterday.p  pI believe I have found the answer in using TempData. My new question is whether or not stringing along TempData through actions as in wizard steps will keep all the prior TempData or if I have to keep redeclaring to keep it in each action.p  pSo, if TempData Step1 has fields 1, 2 and 3, and then Step2 has fields 4, 5 and 6, will 1 through 6 be kept in Step3 thuslyp  precode[HttpPost] public ActionResult Step1 Step1Model model      if ModelState.IsValid              TempData[Step1]  model         return RedirectToActionStep2          return Viewmodel   public ActionResult Step2 Step2Model model      Step1Model step1  Step1ModelTempData[Step1]     if step1  null              return RedirectToActionStep1          TempData.KeepStep1     if ModelState.IsValid              TempData[Step2]  model         return RedirectToActionStep3          return Viewmodel  public ActionResult Step3      TempData.Keep  is this keeping Step1 and Step2     return View  codepre  pThe above is oversimplified. Ultimately, I may have 6 or 7 steps and want to know if Step3 had to redeclare the use of Step1 and Step2 as I did in Step2 i.e. in a new Step3, would I have to write codeStep1Model step1...code and codeStep2Model step2...codep

Negative 848 pI have a very perplexing problem. I have a codeUIViewcode with a few buttons spread across it. For whatever reason when you rotate the viewsimulator or device the buttons on the right half of the screen become unclickable. The unclickable area resembles the size of the orientation that was just rotated from. For example, if you have an iPhone in portrait mode and turn it to landscape the unclickable area is about the width of the iPhone screen in portrait. At first I thought that their must be an invisible element on top of that portion of the screen that was intercepting the clicks, but then I set the alpha of everything on screen to 1 and set every elements border color via codeCALayercode so I could inspect. Surprisingly everything was where it was supposed to be and their was nothingthat I could find covering the buttons. I even tried bringing the buttons to the front via code[self.view bringSubviewToFrontself.BUTTON]codep  pI have one function that handles setting the frames of everything when the view is either loaded or rotated. This function call is the ONLY thing in my rotation function and my codeviewWillAppearcode function. The unclickable buttons problem only happens when the device is rotated. For example, if you rotate the device from portrait to landscape and the buttons become unclickable, then all you have to do is select another tab from the tab bar at the bottom to load another view, then when you click back on the tab with the view with this weird problemnot having rotated anything, the buttons are all clickable and working as expected. The thing I just cant comprehend about this problem is that the EXACT same code is called in codeviewWillAppearcode and codedidRotateFromInterfaceOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationfromInterfaceOrientationcode yet the buttons are only unclickable when the device is rotated and the buttons are clicked. If the user clicks on another tab and then returns the the tab with this problem, the buttons now work as expected. p  pTo complicate things further, this problem ONLY occurs on ios7. Everything is all fine and dandy on ios6.p  pI have tried everything I can think of and I just dont have a clue as to why this is happening.p  pHere is some of the codep

Turns out i have to create another fragmentDialogFragment, give the fragment a UIListView, create UI for the list items, create adapters for my list, override getView method for my adapter with custom logic. is there no shortcut to this While this might make me sound lazy which im not btw cos i love coding, what if i want to create 4 additional dialogs, do i have to do this everytime is there no easy way outp  pbtw Im targeting SDK 11 to 19 devices.p  pAny help will be very much appreciated.p

Negative 848 pIve been writing a small database application designed around an sqlite backend. As part of this Ive included some query functionality into my GUI so that the user can get at the data they need. The data is loaded into a DataTable and eventually makes its way to a datagridview in a dockable window. The problem I have is that when I close the window, the memory from the DataTable is not released. Ive done some testing which involved running a query, filling the DataTable from an SQLiteDataAdapter, immediately running code.Clearcode and code.Disposecode on the DataTable and finally setting the DataTable to null. The memory usage still persists. Im almost positive it is the DataTable as the memory usage goes up by about 170mb when I fill the DataTable from the adapter.

Negative 848 pHello stackoverflow community,p  pis it somehow possible to disable the sorting mechanism in a grid for every column on a condition Like...  if the grid hasnt any data loaded,  the sorting should be disabled,  else enabled.p  pI have the problem that if there is no data and you click on a column to sort, the remote sorting mechanism, will start loading the whole data and sorts it, too ... This behaviour isnt needed or wished, so I want to disable the sorting possibility.p  pYour help is appreciated. Thanks in advance and have a nice day.p

Negative 848 pI am trying to implement sprites in DX11, but I dont know how to proceed with texturing them.p  pFirst off, there might be multiple sprites, each using a different textureatlas. But since I  dont know how many sprites are onscreen, I cant use codeTexture2D[x]code in my shader code.p  pSo I looked at using codeTexture2DArraycode, but then I have to initialize the codeD3D11Texture2Dcode object itself as an array of textures. That seems to me to be a problem, because in one moment, sprites A, B, C might be on screen, and the next moment sprites B, C, D are on screen. So then I would have to create two codeD3D11Texture2Dcode objects, both containing the B and C textures. And in any case, it looks like textures in arrays must be of the same size..p  pAnd thats an absolute disaster. So  is there something I am missing about arrays And what are my options for doing this in the most efficient way Do I have to set a single texture, draw all sprites that use that texture, and repeat Because that also seems quite bad.p  pThanks in advancep  pPS. I know this might be premature optimization, but I am new to DX and learning to code welluse the library well is interesting to me. So I would rather spend some time than write a bad solution.p

We have a problem here, when a user checkout on our site and choose credit card as a payment method, the order has been placed. The order waits for a respond from MyGate regarding the 3D secure authorisation.p  pThe payment should be settled once the payment has been authorised which it does, but what I dont understand is, why when the authorisation has failed the order status on Magento does become Canceled but it still settles the payment in Magento saying Total Paid  Amount and not Total Paid  R0.00. This issue is causing stock qty not to be restored when the order has been cancelled because total paid is paid when it is not.p  pIs this a coding issue in Magento or an issue on MyGates side when responding back to Magentop  pPlease can someone assist urgently.p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 848 pstrongIn a nutshell, I need to rename files uploaded via Angular and Node and make that new name available to both the back and front ends I think. What is the best practice for doing sostrongp  pI am using a file upload plugin a hrefhttpsgithub.comdanialfaridangularfileupload relnofollowhttpsgithub.comdanialfaridangularfileuploada in an Angularjs app. The upload hits a route handled by Nodejs, uploads the file then, on success, angular saves the file name into a users account. However, if two people upload a file of the same name there will be a conflict so I need to rename each file perhaps by adding a date and time.p  pMy code works as follows p  ol liAngular handles the upload, hitting a route that node can use.li liNode move the file into place.li lion success, angular saves the file name into the users account. li ol  pIt appears I cannot rename the file prior to uploading. If I rename the file via node after it has been moved into place I run into the issue of needing to get that new name back to angular for saving into the database. Not sure of the best way to approach this process.p  pHere is my current file upload code works fine, just doesnt rename the filep  pIn Angular...p  precode   scope.onFileSelect  function file          var photo  file[0]         scope.upload  upload.upload             url uploaduserphoto,             headers ContentType photo.type,             file photo,             method POST         .progressfunction evt              removed for brevity         .successfunction data, status, headers, config              User.currentUser.userprofileimage  photo.name             User.updateUser         .errorfunction err               removed for brevity                codepre  pThe post route, codeuploaduserphotocode is matched in node withp  precodeexports.uploadProfilePhoto  functionreq, res      var callbacks        callbacks.uploadSuccess  function         res.jsonsuccess           callbacks.uploadFailure  functionerr         removed for brevity           user.handleUserImageUploadreq.files, callbacks  codepre  pWhich sets some callbacks and then hits codehandleUserImageUploadcode which isp  precodethis.handleUserImageUpload  functionparams, callbacks      fs.readFileparams.file.path, functionerr, data         iferr             callbacks.uploadFailureerr                  var newPath  path.resolve.publicfileuploaduserphotos  params.file.filename         fs.writeFilenewPath, data, functionerr              iferr                 callbacks.uploadFailureerr                          callbacks.uploadSuccess                codepre  pWhich, assuming success, takes us back to the success handler of the first bit of Angular code above.  I know I can rename the file in the codehandleUserImageUploadcode method with codefs.renamecode like just a hard coded example...

Negative 848 pIm creating a HTML5 minigame that uses collisiondetection and Ive recently discovered that it has a speed problemp  pstrongI think the reason of this problem is that...strongp  pInside the 60fps ticker there are two codeforEachcode loops, one for the coderectscode array and other for the codelaserscode array. So, when theres 5 rects and 5 lasers in the canvas, itll loop 5 times in the first codeforEachcode and five times in the second strongat each framestrong, and each codeforEachcode function has lots of codeifscode in it, making the game slow.

Negative 848 pThis is pretty basic but stumbling block on picking up MVC coming from Web Forms of coursep  pIf a codeLayout.cshtmlcode has an optional sidebar as a Partial View, how do you get the Controller to pass the codeViewModelcode to it say, codeBlogPostscode without having to include it on all of the Controllers Page  View callsp  pI appreciate the Controllers are where we need to construct Models not inside Views, Partial or otherwise and that any Partial View will inherit the Model from its parent handy. But sometimes the parent page has its own codeViewModelcode eg. codeSearchResultscode  and although I could turn it around by passing the sidebar codeBlogPostscode into every View and only adding the the codeSearchResultscode for that page, am still stuck with same problem  how to selectively pass potential and multiple Models into parent and partial Views.p  pSo we could put any additional Models in the codeViewBagcode and then pull them out in any Partials, and this maybe the best solution, but seems messy and not sure if theyd remain strongly typed. Or is the solution to use an additional Partial View Controller In which case how you do it, because I get a null Object on the codeforeachcode in codeDefaultSideBar1.cshtmlcode and debug shows that the codeadditional DefaultSideBar1code is not running at all so not surprising its model doesnt get injectedp  pCurrent example route in codeHomeController.cscodep  precode[HttpGet]     public ActionResult SearchResultsstring searchText              ViewBag.Title  Search Results         ListltWebResultgt searchData  new ListltWebResultgt          generate searchData etc...         return ViewsearchData      codepre  pCurrent codeSearchResults.cshtmlcode which uses a codeLayout.cshtmlcodep  precode  model IEnumerableltBing.WebResultgt      ... etc etc....     section DefaultSidebar1              Html.PartialDefaultSidebar1      codepre  pAnticipated additional current controller for sidebar which loads but not overridden in controller so with null Object Refp  precode [HttpGet]     public ActionResult DefaultSideBar1              return Viewdb.BlogPosts.ToList      codepre  pcodeCurrent DefaultSideBar1.cshtmlcodep  precode  model IEnumerableltProj.MVC.SPQ.DataEntities.BlogPostgt     ltulgt         foreach var item in Model                      ltligtHtml.ActionLinkitem.Title, Details, new  iditem.ID ltligt              ltulgt codepre

Negative 848 pBack in the days I implemented linked lists and trees using raw pointers. When I tried to implement using smart pointers I came upon the following problem as I dont know what to use for a pointer that will have only one owner but 0 or more referencesp  pFor an example lets take a binary treep  pFor starters the nodes should be the only owners of the pointers the nodes live and die with the tree, so to me it makes sense to make them codeuniqueptrcode and not codesharedptrcodep  precodeclass Tree    stduniqueptrltNodegt root   class Node    stduniqueptrltNodegt leftchild, rightchild  codepre  pAnd then I had to make an algorithm like thatp  precodeNode  node  root.get  lt what type should node be whilenode    if nodegtleftcount lt nodegtrightcount      node  nodegtleftchild.get    else      node  nodegtrightchild.get      do something on node codepre  pBut I dont like using raw pointers. So what kind of smart pointer codenodecode should be The idea is that it should have no ownership over the pointer. I read that codeweakptrcode  which looks like what I want  works only with codesharedptrcode, but again I think that there is no need of the overhead of codesharedptrcode here. At any point in time there will be one and only one owner.p  pAlong the same lines for a linked listp  precodeclass LinkedList    stduniqueptrltNodegt first     type   last    for  type  n  first n  last n  ngtnext   codepre  pstrongeditstrongp  pThe reason why I dont like using raw pointers beyond the point of not using them anymore in C is lets say I want to expose them to the outside via interface it should be clear that they should not be freed. A codesmart pointercode should be the smart choice here.p

Negative 848 pIm trying to write a YUV to RGB shader in HLSL. Specifically, it converts the Yuv420p format which consists of an NM plane of Y values, followed by an N2emM2 plane of U values and then an N2emM2 plane of V values. For example this 1280x720 picturep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoMlWE.png altenter image description herep  plooks like this in YUV format interpreted as an 8bit, 1280x1080 texturep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJPeNL.png altenter image description herep  pIn Direct3D11, Im loading this as a Texture2D with format R8UNorm and dimensions 1280x1080. The tricky part is reconstituting the U and V planes, because as you can see, half the lines are on the left side of the texture, and the other half is on the right side. In the shader, I do this like sop  precodestruct PSIN      float4 pos  SVPOSITION     float2 tex  TEXCOORD   Texture2D picture SamplerState pictureSampler  float4 PSPSIN input  SVTarget      int pixelCoord  input.tex.y  720     bool evenRow  pixelCoord  2  2  0      ... illustrating U values     float ux  input.tex.x  2.0     float uy  input.tex.y  6.0  4.0  6.0     if evenRow              ux  0.5           float u  picture.SamplepictureSampler, float2ux, uy.r     u  255.0       for debug purposes, display just the U values     float4 rgb     rgb.r  uy  1.402  v  128.0     rgb.g  uy  0.344  u  128.0  0.714  v  128.0     rgb.b  uy  1.772  u  128.0     rgb.a  255.0      return rgb  255.0  codepre  pHowever, for some strange reason, this seems to produce a weird horizontal pattern of smeared edgesp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comu3bR2.png altenter image description herep  pNote that if put either true or false as the condition so that ux is either always or never incremented by 0.5f, the pattern doesnt appear  although of course we get half the resolution. Also note that I did a basically copypaste C translation of the HLSL code and it doesnt produce this effectp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com553aZ.png altenter image description herep  pFWIW, Im using WPF to create the window and initialize Direct3D using its HWND via WindowInteropHelper. The size of the window is set to exactly 1280x720.p

I used iptables to filter the RST from being sent for a SYN since i have no one listening on the server endits a raw socket. When i tried to simulate the same with basic socket functions for TCP and captured its trace it looks exactly identical to mine except that i dont get my ACK from client.

Negative 848 pIm designing a music programming language and implementing its syntax as a PEG grammar. The parsing process has ended up being fairly complicated, so what seemed like the simplest approach was to define several, separate grammars, and apply them in sequence. So far I have three grammarsp  ol liTake the entire contents of source file and strip out the comments.li liTake the source file comments removed and separate it by instrument. This results in pairs of instrument namedefinition and the music code to be played by said instrument.li liActually parse music code and return a parse tree of music events.li ol  pOf the three parsers, 3 is by far the most complicated. 1 and 2 are simple by comparison, and take up only about 10 lines each. 3, on the other hand, grows more and more complex the more syntax I implement, and is currently at 33 lines and counting. p  pThe thought occurred me to me that maybe I could condense the 3 grammars into one This might eliminate a little bit of repetition in the grammars, and may even cut down on the number of lines of code in the program itself, but Im not sure if it would overcomplicate things too much. I made a cursory stab at combining them, but quickly found it difficult, as I seemingly would have to address the possibility of comments occurring within every single rule correct me if Im wrong. As it is, I already have a rule for optional whitespace which I have included in the definitions for most musical events in order to allow for some flexibility with whitespace in the syntax. I cant decide if it makes more sense to stick to parsing in multiple passes and have several, separate parsers, one for each task, or if it would be worthwhile to try and combine them into one supergrammar.p  pMy question is this for those of you with experience building PEG grammars, do you often find yourself breaking what would be a large grammar into smaller subgrammars and making multiple passes over your input Are there any advantages performance or otherwise of keeping everything in one grammarp
Negative 848 pI am doing a ticket booking website, which fetches xml results via a SOAP request in PHP. The results are then returned in the form of PHP object array. And then I display those results using PHP. In one request there are over 300 results returned. So I need to build a show by price  low to high or high to low options for the end user. I have very little experience with PHP array objects, can any one please suggest the options that I can look into for this kind of sorting p  pI was thinking of storing all the results to database table then sort then using SELECT query but since there would be many searches each day and each search resulting in atleast 300 entries would make the database very bulky very soon.

Negative 848 pI am very, very memory careful as I have to write programs that need to cope with massive datasets.p  pCurrently my application quickly reaches 32GB of memory, starts swapping, and then gets killed by the system.p  pI do not understand how this can be since all variables are collectable in functions and quickly released except codeTokensStructcode and codeTokensCountcode in the codeTrainercode struct. codeTokensCountcode is just a uint. codeTokensStructcode is a 1,000,000 row slice of [5]uint32 and string, so that means 20 bytes  string, which we could call a maximum of 50 bytes per record. 501000000  50MB of memory required. So this script should therefore not use much more than 50MB  overhead  temporary collectable variables in the functions maybe another 50MB max. The maximum potential size of codeTokensStructcode is 5,000,000, as this is the size of codedictionarycode, but even then it would be only 250MB of memory. codedictionarycode is a map and apparently uses around 600MB of memory, as that is how the app starts, but this is not an issue because codedictionarycode is only loaded once and never written to again.p  pInstead it uses 32GB of memory then dies. By the speed that it does this I expect it would happily get to 1TB of memory if it could. The memory appears to increase in a linear fashion with the size of the files being loaded, meaning that it appears to never clear any memory at all. Everything that enters the app is allocated more memory and memory is never freed.p  pI tried implementing coderuntime.GCcode in case the garbage collection wasnt running often enough, but this made no difference.p  pSince the memory usage increases in a linear fashion then this would imply that there is a memory leak in codeGetTokenscode or codeLoadZipcode. I dont know how this could be, since they are both functions and only do one task and then close. Or it could be that the codetokenscode variable in codeStartcode is the cause of the leak. Basically it looks like every file that is loaded and parsed is never released from memory, as that is the only way that the memory could fill up in a linear fashion and keep on rising up to 32GB.p  pAbsolute nightmare Whats wrong with Go Any way to fix thisp  precodepackage main  import      bytes     code.google.compgo.texttransform     code.google.compgo.textunicodenorm     compresszlib     encodinggob     fmt     github.comAlasdairFBinSearch     ioioutil     os     regexp     runtime     strings     unicode     unicodeutf8   type TokensStruct struct      binsearch.Keystring     Value [][5]uint32   type Trainer struct      Tokens      TokensStruct     TokensCount uint   func checkErrerr error      if err  nil          return          fmt.PrintlnSome Error, err     panicerr    Local helper function for normalization of UTF8 strings. func isMnr rune bool      return unicode.Isunicode.Mn, r  Mn nonspacing marks    This map is used by RemoveAccents function to convert nonaccented characters. var transliterations  map[rune]string E,  D,  L,  OE,  Th,  ss,  e,  d,  l,  oe,  th,  OE,  oe    removeAccentsBytes converts accented UTF8 characters into their nonaccented equivalents, from a []byte. func removeAccentsBytesDashesb []byte []byte, error      mnBuf  make[]byte, lenb     t  transform.Chainnorm.NFD, transform.RemoveFuncisMn, norm.NFC     n, , err  t.TransformmnBuf, b, true     if err  nil          return nil, err          mnBuf  mnBuf[n]     tlBuf  bytes.NewBuffermake[]byte, 0, lenmnBuf2     for i, w  0, 0 i lt lenmnBuf i  w          r, width  utf8.DecodeRunemnBuf[i]         if r                tlBuf.WriteByte           else              if d, ok  transliterations[r] ok                  tlBuf.WriteStringd              else                  tlBuf.WriteRuner                               w  width          return tlBuf.Bytes, nil   func LoadZipfilename string []byte, error       Open file for reading     fi, err  os.Openfilename     if err  nil          return nil, err          defer fi.Close      Attach ZIP reader     fz, err  zlib.NewReaderfi     if err  nil          return nil, err          defer fz.Close      Pull     data, err  ioutil.ReadAllfz     if err  nil          return nil, err          return norm.NFC.Bytesdata, nil  return normalized   func getTokenspibn string []string      var data []byte     var err error     data, err  LoadZipstoredir  pibn  text.zip     checkErrerr     data, err  removeAccentsBytesDashesdata     checkErrerr     data  bytes.ToLowerdata     data  reg2.ReplaceAlldata, []byte2  remove contractions     data  reg.ReplaceAllLiteraldata, nil     tokens  strings.Fieldsstringdata     return tokens   func t Trainer Start      data, err  ioutil.ReadFilelist.txt     checkErrerr     pibns  bytes.Fieldsdata     for i, pibn  range pibns          tokens  getTokensstringpibn         t.addTokenstokens         if i100  0              runtime.GC  I added this just to try to stop the memory craziness, but it makes no difference                 func t Trainer addTokenstokens []string      for , tok  range tokens          if , ok  dictionary[tok] ok              if indx, ok2  t.Tokens.Findtok ok2                  ar  t.Tokens.Value[indx]                 ar[0]                 t.Tokens.Value[indx]  ar                 t.TokensCount              else                  t.Tokens.AddKeyAttok, indx                 t.Tokens.Value  appendt.Tokens.Value, [5]uint320, 0, 0, 0, 0                 copyt.Tokens.Value[indx1], t.Tokens.Value[indx]                 t.Tokens.Value[indx]  [5]uint321, 0, 0, 0, 0                 t.TokensCount                                return   func LoadDictionary      dictionary  makemap[string]bool     data, err  ioutil.ReadFiledictionary     checkErrerr     words  bytes.Fieldsdata     for , word  range words          strword  stringword         dictionary[strword]  false        var reg  regexp.MustCompile[az09s] var reg2  regexp.MustCompilebclalldalldellnellsullcollpellglagldagldeglneglsuglunmtsvdqunj[az] contractions var dictionary map[string]bool  func main      trainer  newTrainer     LoadDictionary     trainer.Start  codepre

Negative 848 pI wrote a simple Tic Tac Toe console app in Java, using a bitboard approach just for fun. It works well for two human players. My objective was to figure out the minimax algorith and implement a computer player. I did this before, for the very naive game of Nim, and the same general object oriented approach worked. I wanted to use the same structure. But in this case, when the computer goes to make a move, it defaces the whole board variable when it searches for its next move. It shouldnt do so, because the makeMove method creates a brand new Board object. My question is, why does this strange thing happen Here is the code, loosely commented, straight from NetBeansp  pThanks in advance for anybody who has the patience to take a look. I want to mention that I looked into the Cloneable interface and the clone method, but to no avail. Then I figured that that shouldnt be the cause, because the way the makeMove method works. So why does the computer player destroy the boardp  precodepackage tictactoe  import java.util.  public class TicTacToe       public static void mainString[] args          Game game  new Game         game.start         class Game      ArrayListltPlayergt players  new ArrayList  An ArrayList for the players      public Game   Determine if players are to be human or CPU         Scanner input  new ScannerSystem.in         String answer          System.out.printfWould you like Player 1 to be CPU [YesNo]          answer  input.nextLine         ifanswer.toLowerCase.startsWithy players.addnew ComputerPlayer0, 3         else players.addnew Player          System.out.printfWould you like Player 2 to be CPU [YesNo]          answer  input.nextLine         ifanswer.toLowerCase.startsWithy players.addnew ComputerPlayer1, 3         else players.addnew Player           public void start          Scanner input  new ScannerSystem.in          whiletrue              clearScreen             Board board  new Board              whileboard.isGameOver                  board  board.makeMoveplayers.getboard.getCurrentPlayer.getMoveboard                           board.display              int winner  board.checkWinner             ifwinner gt 0                  players.getwinner.addWin                 System.out.printfPlayer d wins.

Negative 848 pI am fairly new to both MVC and Entity Framework. I did some reading on both and decided to use Entity Framework Code First Approach as I am building an application from scratch.

I overrided the TicketsContextDbContextdata context class name class method Seed with some initial data like thisp  precode    public class TicketsContextInitializer  DropCreateDatabaseAlwaysltTicketsContextgt      protected override void SeedTicketsContext context              context.Departments.Addnew Department  Name  OPS          context.Departments.Addnew Department  Name  TISMIS           context.Status.Addnew Status  status  OPEN          context.Status.Addnew Status  status  CLOSED          context.Status.Addnew Status  status  IN PROGRESS           context.TISMISPriorities.Addnew TISMISPriority  PriorityId  1, type  1, value  HIGH          context.TISMISPriorities.Addnew TISMISPriority  PriorityId  2, type  1, value  LOW          context.TISMISPriorities.Addnew TISMISPriority  PriorityId  3, type  1, value  MEDIUM           context.OPSPriorities.Addnew OPSPriority  PriorityId  1, type  2, value  HIGH          context.OPSPriorities.Addnew OPSPriority  PriorityId  2, type  2, value  LOW          context.OPSPriorities.Addnew OPSPriority  PriorityId  3, type  2, value  MEDIUM           context.Categories.Addnew Category CategoryId1, CategoryType  FIR          context.Categories.Addnew Category  CategoryId  2, CategoryType  PJR           context.Assignors.Addnew Assignor  UserId  1, FirstName  ASCORProyjoyde, assignor  true          context.Assignors.Addnew Assignor  UserId  2, FirstName  ASCORPmavanipr, assignor  true           context.Requestors.Addnew Requestor   UserId  1, FirstName  ASCORProyjoyde, requestor   true          context.Requestors.Addnew Requestor  UserId  2, FirstName  ASCORPmavanipr, requestor  true          base.Seedcontext               codepre  pNow I created a new Ticket and saved the data to the local sql server. Quite surprisingly it did not take values from dropdown which were selected, but took values which were created by the context on its own with all fields initialised to null except the ID field which took an autogenerated number. To change this I went to Create function added this piece of CodeThe one in Boldp  precode    [HttpPost]     public ActionResult CreateTicketsInfo ticketsinfo              var allUsersfrom FirstName in db.Assignors select FirstName          if ModelState.IsValid                      ticketsinfo.AssignedTo  db.Departments.Findticketsinfo.DepartmentId             ticketsinfo.status  db.Status.Findticketsinfo.StatusId             ticketsinfo.category  db.Categories.Findticketsinfo.CategoryId             ticketsinfo.requestor  db.Requestors.Findticketsinfo.RequestorId             ticketsinfo.assignor  db.Assignors.Findticketsinfo.AssignorId             ticketsinfo.OPSPriority  db.OPSPriorities.Findticketsinfo.OPSPriorityId             ticketsinfo.TISMISPriority  db.TISMISPriorities.Findticketsinfo.TISMISPriorityId             db.TicketsInfoes.Addticketsinfo             db.SaveChanges             return RedirectToActionIndex                     ViewBag.CategoryId  new SelectListdb.Categories, CategoryId, CategoryType, ticketsinfo.CategoryId         ViewBag.DepartmentId  new SelectListdb.Departments, DepartmentId, Name, ticketsinfo.DepartmentId         ViewBag.StatusId  new SelectListdb.Status, StatusId, status, ticketsinfo.StatusId         ViewBag.AssignorId  new SelectListdb.Assignors, UserId, FirstName,ticketsinfo.AssignorId          ViewBag.RequestorId  new SelectListdb.Requestors, UserId, FirstName,ticketsinfo.RequestorId          ViewBag.OPSPriorityId  new SelectListdb.OPSPriorities, PriorityId, value,ticketsinfo.OPSPriorityId          ViewBag.TISMISPriorityId  new SelectListdb.TISMISPriorities, PriorityId, value,ticketsinfo.TISMISPriorityId          return View ticketsinfo      codepre  pNow the correct ids were saved in the categoryID,AssignorId,etc column of TicketInfoes with values taken from database itseif. However none the values corresponding to these ids are populated when I am trying to view the Ticket page. The Index Function is as followsp  precode     public ViewResult Index              var ticketsinfoes  db.TicketsInfoes.Includet gt t.category.Includet gt t.AssignedTo.Includet gt t.status.Includet gt t.OPSPriority.Includet gt t.TISMISPriority.Includet gt t.requestor.Includet gt t.assignor         return Viewticketsinfoes.ToList      codepre  pI did some reading on this and found out that Include is used for eagerloading which populates the related values in the navigational objects of the class. The controller class is named as  TicketsInfoController. Please suggest a solution or explanation of this scenario. Am I missing something here or is it a case of bad database design Like when I explicitly found the objects from context and set then in create, it saved the correct objects and their foreign key values, do i have to find the exact navigational objects and set them while using include Please ask any more questions that would be required for any of you to better understand the scenario, I would be more than happy to helpp

Negative 848 pAs much as I have read and understood, the Dictionary internally uses hashing to hash a key to some memory locationcalled bucket and stores the value in a LinkedList over there. If some another key is hashed to the same location, it is probably appended to that linkedlist.p  pI am pretty sure there are enough buckets to make the insertions and removals in the dictionary fast enough but besides that there is also some housekeeping going on. Every time a key is added to the dictionary, the Dictionary.Keys and Dictionary.Values properties are also updated. I wanted to understand the complexity of that. p  pHow does the foreach loop ennumerate through all the keys or values in a dictionary. I tried to Google the answer but didnt really reach a concrete answer. My research comes down to answering this question  How has Microsoft probably implemented the KeyCollection class or even ValueCollection class for that matter p  pIt might be using a Listessentially an array or LinkedList underneath. But then, removing a key from the dictionary would cause inefficient housekeeping, isnt itp  pThere is a similar situation in HashSet also. The elements are inserted in a random fashion based on some hash code. How is foreach enumerating every element when there is no order or no links from one element to anotherp  pCan someone please give me an insight p

When clicking on the button, a JavaScript function clones the codeltdiv classorderlinegtcode and appends it just below. So basically, the submitted form contains several orderlines.p  pNow what I want to do is to collect all of the data in my controller, but I couldnt figure out how to do it. Some people suggested me to do something like this in the controllerp  precodepublic static Result createOrderString[] quantity, String[] productId, String[] price       forint i0 iltquantity.length i          ...            forint i0 iltproductId.length i          ...            forint i0 iltprice.length i          ...        codepre  pBut the problem with this is that it requires me to implement a custom implicit codeQueryStringBindablecode for the type codeArray[String]code. Isnt that too much for such a basic featurep  pSo my question is stronghow can I handle a form with a variable number of parameters that have the same namestrong Like, how would you implement a shopping cart where you create several orderlinesin a completely random order, and then submit them to create an orderp  pPS  I already tried to have different names like [codeproductId0code, codequantity0code, codeprice0code] for the first line, then [codeproductId1code, codequantity1code, codeprice1code] and so on... for each input, using JavaScript, but it ended up being too complex to keep the index accurate...p

Negative 848 pIve been searching around to find a straight answer to a problem Im facing and the information is a little scattered. Im not sure whether its possible or not based on the answers.p  pBasically Im using codeiBeaconscode as a component to my app. The scenario is this, you have a high street with numerous shops. Each shop has 1 beacon in their window facing to the street. A generic shopping app is on the users phone.p  pWhen a user walks up the high street I want a user to receive a notification when passing a shop. This notification would say something like Check out codeMyShopscode latest offers and discounts with a prompt to open the app. This is all as the app is in the background.p  pAll the beacons have a emconsistent UDID which tie to my appem. And each shop would have its own major identifier.p  pI want the notification to be specific to a shop with a specific beacon major and minor but I cannot find a way of determining which beacon was entered while in the background.p  pAlso some shops may be close and have broadcast overlap, will the background process for entering a region trigger for each beacon you get in range of if they have the same emUDIDemp

Interesstingly sometimes the SeedGenerator came back after several minutes and sometimes it just hung running out of entropy ... checked via cat procsyskernelrandomentropyavail . After more research i found out that a config variable in JAVAHOMElibsecurityjava.security called securerandom.source defines what the source for Random is. In my case, or better in the oracle JDK 8 install for linux, it was devrandom. I am not a linux expert i am a java developer but what i understood is that devrandom can run out of entropy whatever this means but perhaps it means at some point it cant generate any more random numbers. I switched to devurandom and everything was fine with my tomcat.p  pThen i checked how other JDK installs look like on my other various server, which were a wild mix of OpenJDK and older Oracle JDK installs. At least OpenJDK always used devurandom what might be the answer, why i have never had the problem before.p  pstrongNow to my questionstrong Is it sane from Oracle to rely on devrandom when there can be corner cases where the OS cant produce any more numbers I mean servers like Tomcat and many others rely on SeedGenerator from the JDK and debugging this kind of error is really advanced. Took me 2 hours to get to the point where i am now. p
Negative 848 pI am developing a web application using client side MVC. The technology stack is Backbone JS, HTML5 and Spring at the Server side.p  pI have a requirement where I do some data manipulation at the client side using Javascript by using JSON files as the data payload kept on the web server directly. This is a high traffic part of the app and I dont want to hit my app server for such siple data manipulations.p  pNow on the same module  I have a requirement where I need to generate a PDF file which effectively contains a static template and then I need to fill the template using effectively the same data that I already have at client side. I need to generate the PDF and let the user download it.p  pAny idea how can I acheive it completely at the client side in a clean and robust way.p

Negative 848 pIm studying some computer science questions and many questions are about graph traversal and shortest paths. For example, you may be asked to find the shortest path from a point in the graph to another. In order to solve it, one would use breadth first search. The main thing is that graphs usually have correlating functions that give any adjacent nodes a node might have.p  pIf, however, the question had a 2d matrix of lets say 1s and 0s, where one 1s traversable and 0s are not, how would one go about solving such a problem For examplep  precode1101 0110 1011 codepre  pIf a coordinate is given, say [0][0], you may be asked to find all possible paths or the shortest path to the [n][n] point. How would you go about doing this If anyone has any code examples, I would really appreciate it.p

Negative 848 pI m trying to use the new android wear comms API, specifically the Message API to which end I have an Activity plus a service in my watch application and an Activity as the test app in the phone.p  pI have comms working fine in both directions and I can start up my Watch Activity via the comms by sending messages from the Phone app which also works fine except for a single issue which only occurs immediately after a reboot of the watch hardware  p  pIf I start my Watch app via a comms message call immediately after a reboot without first running a Watch App Activity then the message reply returned from the Watch is lost and not seen by the Phone App.p  pIf I run an Activity in the Watch App after the reboot and before initiating comms from the Phone App then the comms messages work fine, even if I close the Watch Activity before sending any messages.p  pMy WearableListenerService code on the Watch side looks like the following much abbreviatedp  precodepublic class MyClass extends WearableListenerService                         implements MessageApi.MessageListener,                                    ConnectionCallbacks,                                    OnConnectionFailedListener   ...

Negative 848 pI have set up tigervncserver on my CentOS 6 machine following a hrefhttpwiki.centos.orgHowTosVNCServer relnofollowthis guidea. At first everything worked fine, I could connect to the server using TightVNC Viewer on my Windows machine. I left the session running in the background for a while. The server closed the inactive connection, which it also does for ssh or any other connections, so thats still normal. So I reconnected and everything was fine.p  pThen I decided to add a different user to the VNC users, as I was running my first connections from root. Thats where it all broke. I couldnt connect to he server anymore, it always told me that the remote computer denied the connection. I made sure the server ports were open in iptables, tried to reinstall tigervncserver, changing the config back to how it was before it broke and disabling the Windows Firewall. After reinstalling it, I was able to launch it without setting a vnc password, so it either saved it somehow from  before or something broke entirely. None of my attempted fixes worked.p

Negative 848 pI have noticed there is a different, the way DOM been updated by Marionette comparing with Backbone. I have created two simple fiddles. One using Backbone and other one based on marionette.

java.lang.Thread.runThread.java795 codepre  pIn the stack trace above, the loadObjects refers to the method that loads potentially large  of objects from the database using Hibernate Criteria query. When the system sees the need to evict some objects from the L2 cache to make room for the newly loaded objects during put operation on ehcache, the ehcache attempts to perform equality test on candidate objects via equals method. This equals method in turn causes Hibernate to try to initialize the proxy object, and thats when the system throws an error because the Hibernate session associated with the previously cached proxy object is no longer valid, and therefore lazy initialization fails.p  pSo, the question becomes  p  p1 Is it legal in terms of Hibernate cache specification for L2 cache implementation to put proxy objects in the L2 cache, or should it have fully resolvedinitialized the proxy object before storing it in the cachep  p2 If the answer to the first question is yes meaning it is allowed to put proxy objects in L2, then how is application layer supposed to deal with situation like this In other word, is this a bug in the HibernateEhcache or in the application How can I work around this issue One work around I thought of is to fully initialize every object that I load from the database. However, Im not sure if that strategy is going to work, because my understanding is that Hibernate layer is putting the object in the L2 cache BEFORE it passes the object to the application layer. But I assume initializing the object even at that point in the application layer would help, since by the time the object is to be evicted from L2, it would have already been fully initialized. But this whole strategy feels like a hack rather than a solution.p
Negative 848 pIm taking a java class and as part of the requirements for my next program I need to have a button that instantiates my object and then I perform various tasks with it. My problem is that once I create my object within the actionlistener that receives the click on the button how do I now use that objectp  precodepublic class Create implements ActionListener       Override     public void actionPerformedActionEvent e          AdvancedAcmeTaxi taxi  new AdvancedAcmeTaxiDouble.parseDoubleinput.getText         selection.setEnabledtrue         btnCreate.setEnabledfalse        codepre  pSo in the above code I have my custom listener and I then create the object but due to the scope I only have access to it here. How do I fix this Please note that for the purview of this class there are no controllers. Just the Model and View. This is a nested class in my GUI class. It is instantiated by     btnCreate.addActionListenernew Createp

Negative 848 pTwo question on two consecutives days here on SO, but well I spent literally all day reading, coding, thinking and I just cannot get this to work 100. p  pBasically, I have a GridView that slides up or down when the user clicks on a button. From the beginning I had problems because the animation, before setting the visibility  gone, does not have time to finish, so it just disappears instead of sliding up. I tried to implement the AnimationListener interface in the Fragment, setting the listener directly to the animation and nothing worked I am yet to understand why. After hours of reading I saw this post and followed the approach.  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4750939androidanimationisnotfinishedinonanimationendonAnimationEnd is not getting called, onAnimationStart works fineap  pSo now I have a nice custom AnimatedGridView but guess what...the onAnimationEndand onAnimationStart too by the way  is not called either. The slideDown works like a charm, but the slideUp disappears instead of sliding.

Negative 848 pHttpClient async methods e.g. PostAsync, GetAsync etc., if an exception is thrown, returns an AggregateException. Now an aggregate exception can contain a list of inner exceptions.

Negative 848 pI am writing an application that uses images intensively. It is composed of two parts. The client part is written in Python. It does some preprocessing on images and sends them over TCP to a Node.js server.  After preprocessing, the Image object looks like this p  precodewindow  img.cropx,y,widthx,heighty window  window.resize48,48,Image.ANTIALIAS codepre  pTo send that over socket, I have to have it in binary format. What I am doing now is p  precodewindow.savewindow.jpg infile  openwindow.jpg,rb encodedWindow  base64.b64encodeinfile.read Then send encodedWindow  codepre  pThis is a huge overhead, though, since I am saving the image to the hard disk first, then loading it again to obtain the binary format. This is causing my application to be extremely slow.  I read the documentation of PIL Image, but found nothing useful there. p

Negative 848 pI recently posted a poor question on how to use recursion to estimate all combinations of lower triangle in C. I managed to find a recursive algorithm that given an array of size n, generates and prints all possible combinations of r elements in array. Ive employed this function using Rcpp in R. Ive then written a loop around this function to get all the subsets of combinations r to r  n. p  precodeinclude ltRcpp.hgt using namespace Rcpp   [[Rcppexport]] int recursiveIntegerVector arr, IntegerVector data, int start, int end, int index, int r      if index  r        for int j0 jltr j         printfd , data[j]     printfn       for int istart iltend ampamp endi1 gt rindex i          data[index]  arr[i]     recursivearr, data, i1, end, index1, r        codepre  pR code with five groupsp  precodeRcppsourceCpprecursive2.cpp nComm lt 5 r lt c2nComm n lt nComm arr lt c1nComm dat lt c1nComm fori in 1n1    recursivearr, dat, 0, n1, 0, r[i]  1 2  1 3  1 4  1 5  2 3  2 4  2 5  3 4  3 5  4 5  1 2 3  1 2 4  1 2 5  1 3 4  1 3 5  1 4 5  2 3 4  2 3 5  2 4 5  3 4 5  1 2 3 4  1 2 3 5  1 2 4 5  1 3 4 5  2 3 4 5  1 2 3 4 5   codepre  pCurrently, this just prints the subsets of combinations I need to estimate my dissimilarities. Id like to be able to  remove the loop and use it as a single Rcpp functionscript. With the end goal to be able to use the subsets currently printed combinations as way to subset rows in an array. Which will be used to calculate the intersect between vectors. So code1 2code will be used to compare rows code1code and code2code in an array. And so forth.  p

Negative 848 pI have built one database where the below audit trail code works flawlessly for both forms and subforms in Access 2010. But now that I am using it again in another database, I now get an error Argument Not Optional at the first codeCallcode. Why would this work in one database and not the other if they both have had the subform created the same exact way I can not get the database to give me more information outside of the not so helpful error code. My best guess is that it has something to do with codeSub TrainingEntryAuditChangesIDField As String, UserAction As String, FormToAudit As Formcode but I cant really tell.

Negative 848 pIt is a common requirement to be able to log all the messages on a message bus. What would be the best way to do this using Azure Service Busp  pWe are currently predominantly using Topics, so would wish to log all the messages going through the system all the topics.p  pThere are 3 possible solutions I can think ofp  p1 We publish all messages using a helper class, which also logs the message if configured to do so. This is the least favoured option as it will be synchronous, and relies on all message publishers using the same helper class.p  p2 Develop an application that will subscribe to every topic, and then log each message.p  p3 Add a subscription on to every topic that will autoforward to a log topic. Develop an application that subscribes just to this one log topic, rather than subscribing to all topics. This seems simpler, but would potentially bottle neck.p

Negative 848 pguys. I was wondering if its possible to define a string by using an identifier string with the text of the string that has to be changedp  pI have some code below, where you can see an example.p  precodevar x1  1 .shhi.clickfunction     var dataid  this.attrdataid      var containerclass     var identifier     ifdataid  1         containerclass  informationcontainer         identifier  x1           ifidentifier  0         this.htmllti ide  dataid   classshowhide fa fapluscirclegtltigt Skjul           containerclass.show         identifier  1         e  dataid.removeClassfapluscircle.addClassfaminuscircle     else         this.htmllti ide  dataid   classshowhide fa faminuscirclegtltigt Vis           containerclass.hide         identifier  0         e  dataid.removeClassfaminuscircle.addClassfapluscircle           codepre  pSo as you can see, I define the x1 string, and then I tell the identifier string that its the x1 string that has to have a value changed, when its clicked. But the problem here, is that it doesnt change the x1 string, probably because it changes the identifier string instead.p  pDoes anyone know a way to get around this Or would I have to make something that checks the identifier, and then change the x1 etc. out from that But Id like it to be clean.p

Negative 848 pIf I wanted to create a new type in C, in which I overload a bunch of operators I can do something likep  precodeclass Stringy      public     explict Stringyconst char buffer     friend Stringy operator  const Stringy amps1, const Stringy amps2  ...      friend Stringy operator  const Stringy amps1, const Stringy amps2  ...      friend stdostreamamp operator ltlt stdostream amposs, const Stringamp s1  ...   codepre  pNow If I attempt to do the same in Haskell, I find myself doing an examplep  pre classlanghs prettyprintoverridecodedata Stringy  Stringy[Char]  do something unrelated here    Stringy gt Stringy gt Stringy   Stringy gt Stringy gt Stringy removeDups  Stringy gt Stringy  do something else unrelated here  gtgt  Stringy gt IO is IO right codepre  pMy point is that the c one looks more put together because everything you do within that class relates in some way to the class. On the other hand it is possible for the operator declarations for the haskell one to be all over the place and not required to be together. If someone takes a look at the c code, they can immediately identify which operations are part of the class and the ones that arent. How would I achieve this same uniformity in Haskellp  pIm still a beginner in Haskell, so please just use the simple way of doing things. Thanksp

Negative 848 pI have created a single jar for Java 7 amp 8 for a JDBC driver using sourcetarget compile options. However, I am having difficulty compiling applications that use the newoverloaded methods in the codeResultSetcode interfacep  blockquote   pNew in Java 8p      pstrongupdateObjectint columnIndex, Object x, SQLType targetSqlTypestrongp      p Available in Java 7p      pstrongupdateObjectint columnIndex, Object x, int targetSqlTypestrongp blockquote  pNote that SQLType is a new interface introduced in Java 8.p  pI have compiled the driver using Java 8, which worked fine. However, when any application using the driver accesses the method codeupdateObjectint, Object, intcode from Java 7, it gets a compilation error saying class file for java.sql.SQLType not found, although the application is not using codeSQLTypecode. I think this is because Java looks at all the overloaded methods to determine the most specific one, and when doing so it can not access the new codeupdateObjectcode method in Java 8 as codeSQLTypecode is not defined in Java 7. Any idea how I can resolve this issuep  pNote that the codeupdateObjectcode method has a strongdefaultstrong implementation in the codeResultSetcode interface in Java 8  so I can not even use a more generic type instead of SQLType in the new method. In that case any application that uses the new method gets a compilation error saying codeupdateObjectcode is ambiguous. p

Here, when I am invoking the static method codegetInstancecode, it will lead to class initialization which implies initialization of static fields. In this case, the fields codemapcode and and codelistcode shouldnt be null.pli lipIn the above example, since the field codeINSTANCEcode is static, its object initialization takes place and its constructor calls codeloadcode when other fields were not initialized. Because of this the fields codelistcode and codemapcode are null. So then why did codenamecode get initialized I am a little confused.pli ol

Negative 848 pIve been going nuts trying to write an automated test for my user sign up page. Users will be charged a recurring subscription via Stripe. They input their basic details email, password, etc and their credit card details on the same form, then the following flow happensp  ol liOn the clientside stripe.js makes an AJAX request to Stripes servers, which assuming everything is valid returns a credit card token.li liMy javascript fills in a hidden input in the HTML form with the credit card token, and submits the form to my Rails server.li liNow on the serverside I validate the users basic details. If theyre invalid, return because theres no point charging them via Stripe if e.g. their email address is invalid so they cant create an account anyway.li liIf theyre valid, attempt to create a codeStripeCustomercode object, add the right subscription and charge them using Stripes ruby gem etc.li ol  pAll of this works perfectly fine... except I cant figure out how to test it. Testing step 4 is easy enough as it takes place on the serverside so I can mock out the Stripe calls with a gem like VCR.p  pStep 1 is whats giving me trouble. Ive tried to test this using both codepuffingbillycode and the codestriperubymockcode gem, but nothing works. Heres my own javascript simplifiedp  precode    var stripeResponseHandler  function status, response        console.logresponse handler called       if response.error           show the errors on the form        else           insert the token into the form so it gets submitted to the server         creditcardtoken.valresponse.id           Now submit the form.         form.get0.submit                   form.submitfunction event         Disable the submit button to prevent repeated clicks       submitBtn.propdisabled, true       event.preventDefault        console.logcreating token...       Stripe.createToken          Get the credit card details from the form          and input them here.       , stripeResponseHandler         Prevent the form from submitting the normal way.       return false      codepre  pJust to reiterate, this all works fine when I test it manually. But my automated tests failp  precode FailureError expectsubmitform.to changeUser.count.by1    expected result to have changed by 1, but was changed by 0 codepre  pWhen I try to use the gem codepuffingbillycode, it seems to be caching codestripe.jscode itself which is loaded from Stripes own servers at codejs.stripe.comcode, not served from my own app, as Stripe dont support this., but the call initiated by codeStripe.createTokencode isnt being cached. In fact, when I log into my Stripe server logs, it doesnt seem that the call is even been made or at least Stripe isnt receiving it.p  pNote those codeconsole.logcode statements in my JS above. When I run my test suite, the line creating token... gets printed, but response handler called. doesnt. Looks like the response handler is never being called.p  pIve left out some details because this question is already very long, but can add more on request. What am I doing wrong here How can I test my sign up pagep  pstrongUPDATEstrong See [my comment on this Github issue] on striperubymock for more info on what Ive tried and failed.p

Negative 848 pI am creating a site which will filter user options and display final results upon those parameters.  Basically Im not sure how to properly set up the database because there always ends up being soo many fields when I try.  I will be using brandid for primary key and the site will display the brand that has attributes such as material, style, width, height, cost.  One brands, for example, would have material wood, style picture, width 32, height 30, cost 1,200..while another brand may have all those parameters except maybe the size will be one inch different.  My question is what would the best way to set up the database be so there will be as few duplicatenear duplicate rows  Thanks for any help and I hope I am clear with my question.p

Negative 848 pThese days I am reading the Code Complete book and Ive passed the part about couplinglevels simpledataparameter, simpleobject, objectparameter and semantic coupling. Semantic being the worst kindp  blockquote   pThe most insidious kind of coupling occurs when one module    makes use not of some syntactic element ofanother module but of some semantic    knowledge of another modules inner workings. p blockquote  pThe examples in the book usually lead to runtime failures, and are typical bad code, but today I had a situation that Im really not sure how to treat.p  pFirst I had a class, lets call it codeProvidercode fetching some data and returning a codeListcode of codeFoocodes.p  precodeclass Provider     public ListltFoogt getFoos           ArrayListltFoogt foos  createFoossome processing here where I create the objects       return foos      codepre  pA consuming class executes an algorithm, processing the codeFoocodes, merging or removing from the codeListcode based on some attributes, not really important. The algorithm does all of its processing with the head of the list. So there is a lot of operations readingremovingadding to the head.p  pI just realized I could have made the algorithm looking like merge sort, recursively calling it on halves of an array, but that doesnt answer my question  p  pI noticed Im returning an codeArrayListcode so I changed the providing class codegetFooscode method to return an codeLinkedListcode. The codeArrayListcode has On complexity with head removals, while codeLinkedListcode has constant complexity. But it then struck me that I am possibly making a semantic dependency. The code will certainly work with both implementations of codeListcode, there are no sideeffects, but the performance will also be degraded. And I wrote both classes so I can easily understand, but what if a colleague had to do implement the algorithm, or if he uses the codeProvidercode as a source for another algorithm which favors random access. If he doesnt bother with the internals, like he should not, I would mess up his algorithm performance.p  pDeclaring the method to return codeLinkedListcode is also possible, but what about the program to interface principlep  pIs there any way to handle this situation, or my design has flaws in the rootsp

Negative 848 pI am using CartThrob and CartThrobs Global Item Options addons and would love to get opinions on the best way to setup products so that I can achieve specific results.p  pI am creating a site for displaying and purchasing leather samples.  There are about 20 different qualities or types of leather and each quality has their own color palette.  Some leathers have 5 or 6 colors and some have 30 or 40.p  pI modified the Global Item Options addon slightly to add additional characteristics. So now I have optionname, optionvalue, price, colorfamily.  The optionname holds the actual color number and name. i.e. cp1202faraglioni. cp1202 is the color number, and faraglioni is the color name. Since faraglioni doesnt mean anything to most people we use the colorfamily, in this case, beige, to group colors into something most people can understand.p  pOn my products page, which works perfectly, I am able to show the product itself and all the meaningful data about it along with all the colors available in that product line.  One of those meaningful pieces of data being grain texture full, raised, medium, pronounced, etc.. p  pNow, I want to create a full color book which would, by default, show all available colors for all product lines grouped by the colorfamily.  And then the idea would be to create ways to filter the list down a bit.  Choosing, lets say, only reds, and only reds that have a raised grain texture.p  pI cant figure out how to make this happen.  I started thinking I would need a separate product for every color over 1200 of them but that seems crazy.  The way its setup now seems like the way to go but I cant figure out how to structure it.p  pAny idea or opinions would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 848 pIm looking for a way to load a bunch of embedded images into a global array of byte arrays that can be called by reference.  Or if theres a smarter way to do this, that would be great, too.p  pThe purpose is as follows  I have a handful will probably be 56 in the end of blank images that will be called, modified, and written out to files sometimes just .tif files, sometimes embedded into an .xml file.  This is a primary function of the app, and images are called a lot a typical use of the application might generate 5001000 images.  Right now Im using a single embedded image as proof of concept.  I also want the user to be able to choose which images they might use, and then each will be randomly assigned per image created.  In other words, there might be five possible base images, if the user checks two of them, every time an image is called I want it to randomly choose between the two they have selected as options.p  pThe array would allow easy random picking each time, and also keep the byte array for each loaded in memory for quicker access I believe.p  pSo, load all image resources into an array at launch, then copy the needed image form that array each time, modify it and save it out as needed.p  pThoughtsp

Negative 848 pIm currently working on a project using THREE.js to build a 3d environment to represent a mountain range.  For the purposes of this project, Im taking input from the user in the form of a list of contour lines, and to improve the quality of the output, I want to know what the spine of the mountain looks like.  p  pTo represent that, I used an algorithm that produces Voronoi cells, found here a hrefhttpsgithub.comgorhillJavascriptVoronoi relnofollowhttpsgithub.comgorhillJavascriptVoronoia and now Im trying to trim the output to only show edges of the voronoi diagram contained in a polygon.  The problem is that Im simply using raycasting from each vertex of each edge in the diagram, and if both cross the edge of the polygon an odd number of times it is inside the polygon, and anything else is excluded.  I cant figure out why the output isnt representing that, and I think its a problem with how Im using the THREE.Raycaster.  Heres a simplified snipped of my code that is supposed to handle it.p  precodevar raycaster  new THREE.Raycaster raycaster.linePrecision  0 for i  0 i lt diagram.edges.length  1 i      raycaster.setnew THREE.Vector3diagram.edges[i].v1.x, 0, diagram.edges[i].v1.y, new THREE.Vector31, 0, 0.normalize     var p1intersects  raycaster.intersectObjectpolygon     raycaster.setnew THREE.Vector3diagram.edges[i].v2.x, 0, diagram.edges[i].v2.y, new THREE.Vector31, 0, 0.normalize     var p2intersects  raycaster.intersectObjectpolygon     ifp1intersects.length  2  1 ampamp p2intersects.length  2  1          output.pushdiagram.edges[i]       codepre  pdiagram.edges holds all the edges generated by the voronoi diagram algorithm, polygon is an instance of THREE.line with 50 vertices, and I chose the direction vector arbitrarily since this method should work in any direction.  If anyone has ideas about why this is giving me inconsistent results, Id love any input at all.p

Negative 848 pJeez, this is probably so ridiculous but Ive been fiddling for several hours and cant seem to figure out how to do this.p  pLets start with some CSSp  precodewrapper      margin 0 auto     padding 0 20px     width 960px   wrapper .block      width 920px     height 690px   wrapper .container      backgroundcolor 000     width 920px     height 80px   wrapper .container div      margin 20px auto 0     width 510px     height 35px  codepre  pPretty simple. This container sits under a block, and nests another little container within it which probably doesnt matter, but I included it just in case its an omen, and its all inside a big ol page wrapper. So basically, after a certain point of scrolling down the page, I want code.containercode to become fixated to the top of the page and expand to the width of the window. I also want code.containercode to revert to its original state should said point be crossed again in the opposite direction.p  pIve accomplished the fixation with jQueryp  precodefunction      window.scrollfunction          if this.scrollTop gt 690 .container.css             position  fixed,             top  0,             left  50,             marginleft  460px                  if this.scrollTop lt 690 .container.removeAttrstyle       codepre  pFor the life of me, though, I cant figure out how to expand and retract the width of code.containercode with said logic, whilst keeping everything centered and without any glitches or delays. The effect, then, is that the width of the container expands from the centerends of its original width to the width of the page after the scroll position on the page passes or is at code690pxcode, and reverts back when the scroll position is before said value.p  pOn a basic level, this is what I understandp  precodefunction      window.scrollfunction          if this.scrollTop gt 690 .container.animatewidth  100         if this.scrollTop lt 690 .container.animatewidth  920px       codepre  pMy issue is that I cant seem to get these two concepts to work together seamlessly. I did think about possibly using some sort of hack by making an empty codedivcode that sits behind the container and becomes animated once those scroll position conditions are met, but I cant get something as seemingly simple as that to work either.p  pFor conveniences sake, I also went ahead and made a quick visual representation of what Im aiming for, in case I was faulty in my explanationp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhBD8S.gif altExample of jQuery expansionretraction effect with fixation conditionsp  pIs there something I should editaddremove in my CSS or jQuery, or both Should I consider saying to hell with it and try to accomplish the same effect with CSS3 transitions Or would that make things more complicated Im going insane thinking that something that seems so simple could be so difficult, and Ill probably flip my lid if there turns out to be an incredibly simple solution that I overlooked, hahaha.p  pAny helpfeedbackwhatever would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 848 pI have data on machine tool consumption based on four separate dimensions  plant size, state, machine type, industry. Each dimension has a different set of members  5, 50, 36, and 26 respectively. Total consumption is the same for all four dimensions, but within each dimension I know the breakdown of consumption. For example, I know the amount of machine tool consumption at each of the five plant sizes. p  pI know there are approximately 2,000 unique combinations of the four dimensions I understand there are actually a lot more possible combinations than that that I need to fill with data. Im trying to use OpenSolver to do this, but I cant figure out how to set up the problem.p  pI tried summing the unique combinations and making that sum equal my target since I know the total. Then I tried to sum all of the unique combinations that have a plant size code 1 and set them equal to what I know the consumption for plant size 1 should be. Then I did this for all the unique combinations that have a plant size code 2, etc. I did this for the members of each of the four dimensions. I used these as my constraints.p  pBut, OpenSolver crashes every time I try to solve this. p  pIm knew to solving problems like this in Excel. I dont even know what type of problem this is to find some solutions. Any help would be appreciated.p

In the codepadddcode instruction 1st operand refers to address in global memory instead of moving it a register first.p  pDoes this mean that when codepadddcode get executed, it does a mov from global memory to register first and then add two operands which are in registers Which is equivalent to the following code sequencep  precodemovdqa  0rbp,rax, xmm7 movdqa  0r12,rax, xmm8     paddd xmm8, xmm7 movdqa  xmm7, rbx,rax codepre  pLet me know if you need more information like compilable program, so that you can generate assembly for yourself.p

Negative 848 pIm planning to port my WP8.1 app to Windows 10 as a Universal app. I saw that MS added the ability to create a single Universal project, and to create different familyspecific folders that contain XAML pagescontrols that share a single codebehind file.  I emdont likeem a few things about this approach thoughp  p I can only have different XAML files for different devices, but with the emsameem .cs file, so it wouldnt be easy to create some devicespecific UI logic, like animations and stuffp  p Since Id have a single Universal project, Id have to check at emruntimeem the availability of the APIsclasses I need, instead of being able to see whether I can use them or not at compile time, which is much better in my opinion.p  pI saw an MVA video where Jerry Nixon and Andy Wigley said that the classic multiheaded Universal projects would still be supported on Windows 10, but I have no idea on how to set them up, and I cant find a documentation anywhere.p  pEverybodys talking about this single project with shared .cs files, but Id really feel more comfortable working with a multiheaded project one for mobile phones, one for desktoptablets, and possibly a emshared projectem or some sort of PCL to share classes and stuff between the two projects a shared project like with W8.1WP8.1 would be awesome.p  pAny ideas how to do thatp

Negative 848 pI am writing a function in python for scientific computation. One of the arguments of this function represents a realvalued input parameter. If a complex value is passed as this argument, the result of the function will be incorrect because I am not implementing a special care needed for the case of complexvalued input, but the function will return an incorrect value without error or exception because each line in the function is valid in terms of syntax. p  pFor example, please consider a function like thisp  precodeimport numpy as np def foovara          This function evaluates the Foo formula for the real variable vara.     This function does not work for the complex variable vara because I am      too lazy to take care of the branch cut of the complex squareroot function.          if varalt0         vv  0.57386286vara     else         vv   3.49604327vara     return np.sqrtvv codepre  pThe function codefoocode will return a complex value even if the argument codevaracode is complex because codenumpy.sqrtcode function is also defined for complex argument, but the returned value will be incorrect supposing that the function codefoocode was implemented with only real argument in mind.p  pHow can I check in the function that an argument is realvalued so that I can make the function throw an exception or exit by error otherwise p  pPlease not that I want to keep the function working for both the native codefloatcode type of python as well as an numpy array of codefloatcode type elements.
