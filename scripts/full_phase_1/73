Positive 73 pI want to compare each row of a CSV file with itself and every other row within a column. brFor example, if the column values are like thisp  pValue1br Value2br Value3p  pThe code should pick Value1 and compare it with Value1 yes, with itself too, Value2 and then with Value3. Then it should pick up Value2 and compare it with Value1, Value2, Value3, and so on.p  pIve written following code for this purposep  precodecsvfile  ctemptemp.csv with opencsvfile, newline as f     reader  csv.readerf, delimiter,     for row in reader         for comparerow in reader             if row  comparerow                 printrow,is equal to,comparerow             else                 printrow,is not equal to,comparerow codepre  pThe code gives the following outputp  precode[Value1] is not equal to [Value2] [Value1] is not equal to [Value3] codepre  pThe code compares Value1 to Value2 and Value3 and then stops. Loop 1 does not pick Value2, and Value3. In short, the first loop appears to iterate over only the first row of the CSV file before stopping.p  pAlso, I cant compare Value1 to itself using this code. Any suggestions for the solutionp

So, I was wondering, what is the best way to add two strings together, when focusing on performancep  pWhich of these four is better, or is there another way which is betterp  precodeNote that normally at least one of these two strings is variable str1  Hello  str2  World  output1  str1.str2 This is said to be bad  str1  Hello  output2  str1.World Also bad  str1  Hello str2  World output3  sprintfs s, str1, str2 Good This last one is probaply more common as output  sprintfs s, Hello, World  str1  Hello  str2  aWorld output4  strreplacea, str1, str2 codepre  pDoes it even matter  p

Negative 73 pWhen you load in an external swf at runtime is there any way to get the background colour of the swf  That is the stage background colour. The loaded swf is uploaded by users, who may or may not know the correct colour.br I know that normally this is specified in the HTML code to embed a swf, but if you run a swf in the standalone player it will display the correct colour, so the information should be there somewhere.br What I want to do is to create a background behind the loaded swf, so it will display like intended.p  pEDIT I would prefer a client side solution if it is at all possible. If not the server side is .net based.p
Negative 73 pI dont know if this is possible, but I am trying to code an Access textbox that will act as a search engine entry control for a database.  Specifically, I wanted to add mulitple, nonvisible, listboxes to a form, and have them filled with table or query data.  When ever an enduser enters a search word in the textbox and presses search, I wanted to write a series of if statements that would specify if the entry in the textbox matched a value in one of the listboxes, to execute a custom query.  For examplep  pif Me.textbox.text  a value in the listbox then etc ...p  pThe problem is that every example I have seen so far only searches listbox values via numerically or by index, such as listbox.selected0.  Since the textbox takes string values, as opposed to numeric values, the code must equate the textbox entry with an item in the listbox.  I have been able to add a number in the search textbox and find the listbox item that way, but this is impractical since my end users will only know values.  In all, I was wondering if anyone knew how to programmatically search a listbox for a specific value that equals the value entered in a textbox.p  pThank you,p  pDFM  p

Negative 73 pI am using the jqueryui autocomplete feature to allow the user to select their location.  I need to make sure they select a location from the autocomplete before they can submit the form.  I dont want them to be able to submit the form before they select a value.p  pMy solution is after they submit make sure that the value found is in the database.  The other solution would be that when they click submit or after they leave the location box and go to another field to submit the entry via ajax to ensure it is valid if not show an error and do not let them submit the form.p  pI was wondering if there was something easier I could do, or if there is something more elegant.  I realize they have to be able to type something into the box to get the autocomplete to work, so I could force them to select a value from the autocomplete because it is not a select box, so it seems that my above solutions would be the best way to go.   p  pThoughtsp

What is the difference between all these products  except the PRICE I asked Verisign and other CAs a few times since I am curious, but got no answer.p  pI got a Authenticode certificate from Certum CA. I enrolled it in Internet Explorer, exported it as PKCS12 PFX and could sign EXE, DLL, ... as promised.p  pNow... I tried to import this PFX into Java with keytool, then I tried to sign a JAR.

Mac Linux Isnt Microsoft Authenticode a Software publisher certificate too Isnt a EXE software That really confuses me.p  pSo, my question is now When I have ordered a Microsoft Authenticode cert, is it then illegal to use it to sign e.g. JAR files or if possible any other content There seems to be no technical difference between these certificates. All of those products should have the same codesigning EKUOID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3, which does not make any differences between EXE, JAR, Adobe Air and what the hell also exists around there. So, if all CodeSigning certificates are technically equal, why do I have to decide then if I want to be a Java Developer or Windows Developer or Software Developerp  pMaybe there are still differences in the certificate Maybe I get not enough rights in JARs when I use Authenticodecerts for signingp  pPS I do not use my software commerciallyp

Negative 73 pIn my iPhone app, I made a custom UIView that I use in several different view controllers to display some information. p  pIm familiar with making customer table cells for use in a table but Ive never made a custom view again.p  pMy question is what is the best way to load this view Ive tried simply placing the view in the view controllers I want it to appear in using IB, but that doesnt seem to be enough. It seems to me that it would make sense that if you set the Class Identity for the view that it should load up that view when the view controller is created. Or maybe it doesnt because it doesnt know what nib to get it from its in its own nib, of course.p  pSince its not a view controller, I cant just use initWithNibName. Ive tried using NSBundle loadNibNamed like I do with table cells but it seems like an awfully large amount of work. The code looks like thisp  precodeNSArray topLevelObjects  [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamedMyCustomView ownernil optionsnil] for id currentObject in topLevelObjects      if [currentObject isKindOfClass[MyCustomView class]]          self.customView  currentObject         break       [self.view addSubviewself.customView] codepre  pThere must be an easier way which doesnt involve the loop. Also, creating the view this way makes me lose all the info from IB on where I actually placed the view. Its created at 0,0 which is not where I want it. Yes, I know I can set a new frame, but again, there must be an easier way. Is there a way I can do this all through IB Or at least with less work programmaticallyp

Negative 73 pIm having trouble with a misbehaved library that throws an exception in a finalizer, which of course crashes the application.p  pTo avoid this, I tried loading the library in its own AppDomain, but the exception still bubbles to the surface and crashes the application.p  pAs documented on MSDN, registering to codeAppDomain.UnhandledExceptioncode doesnt prevent the exception from bubbling up, but Im quite surprised that there is no other way to catch such an exception in a sub AppDomain.p  pHow do plugin hosts, or applications that use AppDomains to sandbox potentially harmful code, do to stop unhandled exceptions  Is it in fact possible p  pstrongNotestrong I already have another workaround, the one described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1301292whydoappdomainexceptionsinvariablyterminatetheapplicationherea. The bad finalizer is on a longlived object, which seems to be only collected during shutdown, so it is sufficient to hide this bogus error from the user. Still, I find this workaround brittle, since it will either hide other, real errors, or risk blowing up my application if the object is collected earlier.p

Negative 73 pIve recently had some issues implementing a zooming feature into a painting application. Please let me start off by giving you some background information.p  pFirst, I started off by modifying Apples glPaint demo app. I think its a great source, since it shows you how to set up the EAGLView, etc...p  pNow, what I wanted to do next, was to implement zooming functionality. After doing some research, I tried two different approaches.p  p1 use glOrthof p  p2 change the frame size of my EAGLView.p  pWhile both ways allow me to perfectly zoom in  out, I experience different problems, when it actually comes to painting while zoomed in.p  pWhen I use 1, I have to render the view like thisp  precodeglMatrixModeGLPROJECTION glLoadIdentity glOrthofleft, right, bottom, top, 1.0f, 1.0f those values have been previously calculated glDisableGLBLEND Im using Apples Texture2D class here to render an image [textures[kTextureMyImage] drawInRect[self bounds]] glEnableGLBLEND [self swapBuffers] codepre  pNow, lets assume I zoom in a little, THEN I paint and after that, I want to zoom out again. In order to get this to work, I need to make sure that kTextureMyImage always contains the latest changes. In order to do that, I need to capture the screen contents after changes have been made and merge them with the original image. The problem here is, that when I zoom in, my screen only shows part of the image enlarged and I havent found a proper way to deal with this yet.p  pI tried to calculate which part of the screen was enlarged, then do the capturing. After that Id resize this part to its original size and use yet another method to paste it into the original image at the correct position.p  pNow, I could go more into detail on how I achieved this, but its really complicated and I figured, there has to be an easier way. There are already several apps out there, that perfectly do, what Im trying to achieve, so it must be possible.p  pAs far as approach 2 goes, I can avoid most of the above, since I only change the size of my EAGLView window. However, when painting, the strokes are way off their expected position. I probably need take the zoom level into account when painting and recalculate the CGPoints in a different way.p  pHowever, if you have done similar things in the past or can give me a hint, how I could implement zooming into my painting app, Id really appreciate it.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 73 pI have connected 2 mice to PC and I wish one mouse to work as regular mouse and capture second mouse exclusively. p  pFirst I was trying DirectInput.

Negative 73 pSo my problem is relatively simple, Ive Googled all over to find a solution but Ive yet to find one.p  pThe problem is, Ive developed a WYSIWYG plugin for Drupals WYSIWYG moduleframework not sure if this is relevant. The purpose of the plugin is to allow embedding of video files inside the WYSIWYG content. Our client offers a video uploadingediting API which their customers use to embed files on their pages.p  pTo put it simply, my plugin opens up a popup where the user selects one of their videos as fetched from their account at the clients site, the plugin then calls the API and is returned with HTML and JavaScript for embedding the video which is then inserted into the WYSIWYG content.p  pThis works like a charm in Firefox, however I have a few problems with it in Chrome. After debugging back and forth Ive noticed that the embedded JavaScript inside the WYSIWYG editor gets escaped IE, quotes turned into ampquot etc.p  pThis does not happen with Firefox so its most likely Chrome which is causing it, or perhaps even Webkit Ive already checked the HTML and JavaScript that gets returned through the Ajax call and it is fine, its when it gets embedded inside the WYSIWYG it gets escaped.p  pThe WYSIWYG editor Ive tested in is TinyMCE by the way.p

Negative 73 pI understand that String is an object, as opposed to say Int, and object variables generally dont point to anything unless you create the object. So I know how it works.p  pBut, in terms of simple, practical programming, why doesnt .NET initialise a string as empty , as that is surely the most common use of the string variable  as a string, not as an objectp  pIve never yet had need for a string to be null, that is not a string. It seems to be a rare requirement. Im unable to say an int variable is null, so why do so with string Having it as an option is undoubtedly necessary, but why does .NET make it null to begin with, when int etc. are given proper initial valuesp  pIm asking because I like to understand not just how something works but why, as it reduced my desire to rant about how weird it seems. p

Negative 73 pFor many problems I see the solution recommended is to use a unionfind data structure. I tried to read about it and think about how it is implemented using C. My current understanding is that it is nothing but a list of sets. So to find which set an element belongs we require codenlog ncode operations. And when we have to perform union, then we have to find the two sets which needs to be merged and do a codesetunioncode on them. This doesnt look terribly efficient to me. Is my understanding of this data structure correct or am I missing somethingp

Negative 73 pI did a few things wrong while merging trunk into a branch. First I thought its easier to checkout a new working copy of the trunk and add all changes by hand. Then I thought its ok to remove the branched src folder and overwrite it with the src from the trunk. Now its clear that the .svn folders arent the right folders as they belong to the trunk instead of to the branch. So I decided to delete all .svn folders, but now I dont know how its easiest to add it to the branch once again or how to create a new branch with all my changes.p  pI suppose I did everything wrong so far...p  pI think I will disconnect my project, checkout the head revision of the branch, but then again I somehow want to override the branch, that is more or less replace the whole srcfolder standard maven layout.p  pWell its more or less that I can disconnect my changes from svn, which is essentially the current state src is not a working copy, as such I can also disconnect everything. Alternatively I have a copy without the removed .svn folders, but the .svn folders point to the trunk, thats the whole problem.p  pkind regards,br Johannesp
Negative 73 pThe author claims that his awk script will print out all the limits for a POSIX.1 and XSI compliant system. I am using Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.0 Santiago. When I run his awk script it does not seem to be printing out the codeifdefcode portion of the C program. My thoughts are that sysconf.sym do not exist on this distribution, therefore the while loops never run.

Negative 73 pI have a strange problem with a project I have been working on to implement some extra features. Ive ran it on my development machine and on our local test server. Now when I deployed the EARpackage on the clients test server, strange things happen. The app itself starts off just fine but when trying to log into it, it never succeeds. The password is most certainly correct. Messages I get into codeserver.logcode are followingp  precode20111221 114617,202 DEBUG [com.foo.impl.AuthenticationServiceImpl] Authentication event AuthenticationFailureBadCredentialsEvent admin details org.acegisecurity.ui.WebAuthenticationDetails1c07a RemoteIpAddress xx.xx.xx.xx SessionId 4022FD9349C4BC35553DD7D96134FDE8 20111221 114617,202 INFO  [com.foo.impl.AuthenticationServiceImpl] Authentication event AuthenticationFailureBadCredentialsEvent admin details org.acegisecurity.ui.WebAuthenticationDetails1c07a RemoteIpAddress xx.xx.xx.xx SessionId 4022FD9349C4BC35553DD7D96134FDE8 exception Bad credentials 20111221 114617,203 DEBUG [com.foo.web.server.AuthenticationFilter] Updated SecurityContextHolder to contain null Authentication 20111221 114617,203 DEBUG [com.foo.web.server.AuthenticationFilter] Authentication request failed org.acegisecurity.BadCredentialsException Bad credentials codepre  pI removed the new package and put back the old EAR that had been there for years and the login doesnt work there either.

The differences where in log files and codepostgresds.xmlcode.

Negative 73 pI got a new problem while using vb6 dll in my Web Services. When using dll, the object instance is created fine but when I start calling its method from my service I got this exception p  blockquote   pServer was unable to process request.  Unable to cast COM object   of type WSResevatDLL.WSResevatCLClass to interface type   WSResevatDLL.WSResevatCL. This operation failed because the   QueryInterface call on the COM component for the interface with IID   69F1DA5956D147CE94A4D681ABECDF80 failed due to the following   error No such interface supported Exception from HRESULT 0x80004002   ENOINTERFACE.p blockquote  pThe whole system runs fine when I test it on my computer IIS I have Windows 7 with IIS 7. The problem starts when I publish it on server Windows Server 2003 with IIS 6. Im using asp.net 3.5 web services with SOAP 1.1. The VB dll is from the third part and I sadly cant debug it the only thing I checked with dll creator is that binary compatability is enabled, I dont know VB at all, but when it runs outside the service on Win Server 2003 it works fine.p  pSome explanation bout the types WSResevatCLClass and WSResevatCL. In origin the dll has only one type WSResevatCl. But when I look at the dll in component explorer in Visual Studio I see strange things  there is a class called WSReservatCLClass and 4 different interfaces WSResevatCL, WSResevatCL, WSResevarCLv0 and WS ResevatCLv1. And the most strange thing is that I can create instance of one them WSResevatCL and it drives exactly like an instance of the class.p  pAre there any significant differences between Win7 and WinServer2003 that can cause the crash with such exceptionp
Negative 73 pIm looking for some guidance on best practice around how to structure my Symfony 2.0 application. If I have a few bundles Cart Bundle, Product Bundle, CMS Bundle and I wish to use aspects of all of these bundles when composing my page how should I best do thisp  pI can imagine two ways to do this, but am looking for guidance on which if either is correct.p  p1 Expose all of the functionality of my bundles through services, and have these services available to use directly from within twig. This way I can pass my routing request to the most appropriate bundle so a hrefhttpmyclient.orgUserAccount relnofollowhttpmyclient.orgUserAccounta is passed to the ClientUser bundle to handle, but the base template which has a mini shopping cart in the navigation is able to access the information it needs directly from within twig I dont need to pass this inp  p2 Create a bundle that accesses all the other bundles in order to build up the page like VendorFrontend or VendorBackend. This would mean that ALL routing requests would be passed to this bundle and this bundle would access the required information for every part of the page before passing off to the template.p  pThe first option feels wrong because Im not sure if its even possible to allow Twig to consume services directly though the service containerp  pSecond option feels wrong because Its like using a second router, the routes would be being passed into a bundle, which only exists to compose the other bundles its  a given here that this bundle is tightly coupled to the bundles that it uses. Surely this goes against the concept of a bundle that the code is reuseable.p  pIn this example Im trying to build a very simple ecom site for demonstration purposes only. I have a base template which will have a primary navigation, mini shopping cart, body and footer. Im storing this in the appResources directory. I was planning on having all other templates inherit this one and overriding the body area.p  pNot looking to be spoonfed, just a nudge in the right direction. Thanks.p

Negative 73 pIve got a website where users can potentially type in their own dates before theyre sent to the server. So I obviously need to parse what they give me and get it into a standard format before actually using it. So I used PHPs a hrefhttpwww.php.netmanualenfunction.strtotime.php relnofollowstrtotimea function, which is pretty forgiving about what it will accept as input.p  pBut Im also using a hrefhttpwww.datejs.com relnofollowdate.jsa on the site and its parse function is pretty good, too. Should I use that on the user input before sending it to the server Which one is betterp  pIll keep strtotime on the back end for safety, but if date.js is better Ill add that to the client.p  pTo clarify, Im expecting mostly American date formats. But should that change, anything that eases that transition is preferred.p

Negative 73 pIm currently writing a proxy application that reads from one socket and writes on another. Both are set as nonblocking, allowing multiple sockets pairs to be handle.p  pTo control a proper flow between the sockets, the application should NOT read from the source socket if the writing on the target socket may block. The idea is nice, however I found no way to detect a blocking state of the target socket without first writing to it... and that is not what is needed.p  pI know of an option to use codeSIOCOUTQcode using codeioctlcode and calculate the remaining buffer, but this seems ugly compared to a simple check if the target socket is ready for writing.p  pI guess I can also use codeselectcode for just this socket, but that is so much waste of a such heavy system call.p

Negative 73 pstrongIn response to the helpful comments, I have edited the original question where I had assumed that a forloop and an applyloop give different results.strongp  pI am using R to run a large number of 2group ttests, using input from a delimited table. Following recommendations from here and elsewhere, I tried either forloops and apply to accomplish that. For normal t.test, both work nicely and give the same results. However, for a paired ttest, the forlook appears to works while the applyloop does not. Later, i found out that both loops suffer from the same problem see below but the forloops deals more gracefully with the situation only one cycle of the loop returns an invalid result while the applyloop fails altogether.p  pMy input file looks like this the first line is a header line, the data lines have a name, 4 datapoints for group 1 and 4 datapoints for group 2p  precodeheader g1.1 g1.2 g1.3 g1.4 g2.1 g2.2 g2.3 g2.4 name1  0    0.5  0.2 0.2 0.1 0.4 0.3 0.3 name2  23.2 24.4 24.5 27.2 15.5 16.5 17.7 20.0 name3  ..... codepre  pand so on overall 50000 lines. The first data line starting with name19 turned out to be the culprit.p  pThis is the forloop version that works better failes on the problematic line but correctly deals with all other linesp  precodetable lt read.tablettestin.txt,head1,sept fori in 1nrowtable     g1ltas.numerictable[i,25]    g2ltas.numerictable[i,69]    pv lt t.testg1,g2,pairedTRUEp.value  codepre  pThis is the apply version that causes problemsp  precodetable lt read.tablettestin.txt,head1,sept pv.list lt applytable[,29],1,functionxt.testx[14],x[58],pairedTRUEp.value codepre  pOne of the 50000 data lines is problematic in that the differences of all pairwise comparions are identical, which in a paired ttest results in an undefined pvalue essentially zero. The apply loop crashes with the error data are essentially constant. To me as an R newbie it does not seem to be a good idea to crash the entire script just because the t.test doesnt like one piece of data. In the forloop, this data line also results in an error message but the loop continues and all the other ttests give correct results.p  pDid I do something fundamentally wrong This behaviour a essentially prohibits the usage of applyloops for this kind of batch analysis. Or is there a standard way to circumvent this problem. Why doesnt the ttest just return something invalid for that particular pvalue instead of bailing outp

Negative 73 pI have a linked list question that stems from this homework prompt I am about to post. it might help with the answer p  pSpecificsp  pThe Java String class is immutable you cannot change the contents.  This is sometimes a hindrance to what you want to do with a string i.e. make changes to the existing string.  So, for this assignment you will create a class called MutableString.  NOTEDISCLAIMER The Java API does have a class StringBuffer, which is mutable, but for the intents and purposes of this assignment well pretend we dont know about it   p  precodeAn object of the MutableString class contains the following operationsbehaviors  which means the class itself must contain the following methods  Character charAtint index returns the Character at the specified index in the string  if the index lies outside the string, throw a MutableStringIndexOutOfBoundsException you must write this class  void setint index, Character ch replaces the existing Character at the specified location  if the index lies outside the string throw a MutableStringIndexOutOfBoundsException  void addint index, Character ch creates a new spot in the list for the Character at the index specified  if the index lies outside the string throw a MutableStringIndexOutOfBoundsException  Character removeint index removes the Character at specified index  if the index lies outside the string, throw a MutableStringIndexOutOfBoundsException  boolean removeCharacter ch removes the first occurrence starting from the beginning of the MutableString of the Character  if the Character is not found, return false  boolean removeAllCharacter ch removes all occurrences of the specified Character  if Character is not found, return false  void toUpper converts the current string to all upper case  void toLower converts the current string to all lower case  MutableString substringint start, int finish returns a string starting at the Character specified by start and concluding with the Character specified by finish  if start or finish is outside the the string, throw a MutableStringIndexOutOfBoundsException  char [] toCharArray returns a char array containing all the characters in the string  be sure and handle all cases  int length reportsreturns the length of the string  String toString returns a String containing all the Characters  String toReverseString returns a String containing all the Characters in reverse order  you must utilize recursion to accomplish this task  int compareToMutableString that allows comparison of two MutableString objects  this implies you will implement the Comparable interface for your MutableString class  void sort alphabetizes the letters in caseinsensitive fashion in ascending order  you must write the code for this sort no API calls are allowed codepre  pYou must use a linked list to represent the characters of the string you must write the  LinkeList class.  Your LinkedList class should contain fundamental operations for updating and modifying the list.  With this in mind, implement the List interface in the Java API.  For methods that you deem unnecessary for your LinkedLists functionality, stub those methods out and throw an Exception that contains information about what method was called and that it has not been implemented.  NOTE Make sure your LinkedList class does not do anything MutableString specific.  Feel free to use the following stubbed out LinkedList class for your assignment.  It may not contain all the methods you will need, but it does contain the methods from the List interface from the Java API.p  pMutableString must utilize the LinkedList behaviors methods wherever possible dont write code in MutableString that does the same thing as something in the LinkedList class.  Thus your MutableString will contain a field that is a reference to a LinkedList object.  BTW, this concept is known as delegation, a very important idea in software engineering and design.  Do NOT design MutableString so that it inherits from LinkedList.p  pEach Node of your MutableString should contain a Character  note that this does not mean the reference to the data in your node class shouldmust be type Character  that would make your LinkedList class specific to MutableString, and we dont want that in this case. p  pthe part I dont understand is the paragraph 2 above that talks about inheriting from the linked list class. I was always used to writing something like public class MutableString extends LinkedList but we cant do that and I dont really know how to start writing this mutablestring class without inheriting from the class. Help on explaining how to do it and the difference would be awesome. thanks.p  pIm not very good at linked lists so bare with this question    p

My C complier Visual Studio 2010 gave me a compile error message when I tried to compile this code. In my opinion, there is no problem in this code because it is certain that the function codefuncBasecode will be implemented thus overriden in some derived class of the interface codeDDerivedcode, because it is pure virtual. In other words, any pointer variable of type codeImplementation code should be associated with an instance of a class deriving Implentation and overriding the function codefuncBasecode. p  pMy question is, why the compiler give me such an error message Why the C syntax is defined like that i.e., to treat this case as an error  How can I make the code runs I want to allow multiple inheritance of interfaces. Of course, if I use virtual public or redeclare the function codefuncBasecode in codeImplementationcode like p  pre classlangC prettyprintoverridecodeinterface DDerived  public Derived1, public Derived2      virtual void funcBase  0     virtual void funcDDerived  0  codepre  pthen everything runs with no problem. p  pBut I dont want to do that and looking for more convenient method, because virtual inheritance may degrade the performance, and redeclaration is so tedious to do if inheritance relations of classes are very complex.

Negative 73 pI am writing a program in C which is interfacing with a small display unit that does a whole bunch of stuff thats not relevant to this problem.p  pThe problem I have is detailed as follows When the user selects a button which will attempt to SAVE some settings to the device, it uses an acknowledgement protocol to be sure that the settings went through  Meaning  It sends settings then waits for acknowledgement packet from the device.p  pWhat I do is I generate a thread in my main application which is going to be the parent thread of the threads I am about to generate which will attempt to save to the device. Currently, it works in the following mannerp  ul lipGenerate Thread 1  Try to save.pli lipIf timed out, Interrupt Thread 1  to release the data lock of the device via Thread.Interrupt stronglt this is the problemstrong. This doesnt work. It bolds the lock until the device is shut off or unplugged then it errors out.  Then it would gen a new thread, which happens now but it never works because the first thread still locking out the data.pli lipIf it didnt time out, the callback for thread 1 lets the parent thread know not to generate any more threads.pli lipFinally, if none of the threads succeeded then the overall attempt failed.pli ul  pI have also tried doing this with just a single thread being generated and shut down, which also exhibits the same behavior where when waiting for an acknowledgement from the device it hangs permanently until the device is powered off or unplugged.p  pThere is no way to encapsulate that waiting for the device to send an ack with a boolean that could be set to stop the thread because it never leaves the waiting call.  This is embedded software so I cannot modify the waiting function. I can only modify the C interface to the embedded software.p

Would I just use something like setSomeMethodarguement1, arguement2 in my interface to populate my attributesp  pId also like to note Im using Tapestry5 framework with service Injection.

Negative 73 pIm an appreneur creating iPhone apps, doing everything but coding which is outsourced. Id appreciate some technical guidance on the following iOS 5 implementation of a simple utility app. p  pThere is a custombuilt rich text field where users can input images stored locally, small size 40x44 points and text. This is implemented as codeUIWebViewcode. With the current implementation, each time after an image is tapped, it appears after 1.52 sec delay too long. After its entered once, its cached and next time it appears almost immediately. p  pIs it reasonable that such small images would take up to 2 sec to appear Are there any efficient ways of reducing this time lag for noncached images Any tips would be very welcome. If there is any smart way of implementing this other than using codeUIWebViewcode, it would also help.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 73 pFor my nonapp store app, Ive been using the private framework Core Surface to draw directly to the screen of the iPhone.

Negative 73 pI have created an application in Visual Studio C that makes use of a datagridview. Now, when I assign the DataSource of that datagridview, it automatically selects the first row, and executes my code for selection. Since I frequently reassign that datasource, this is not desireable. Is there any way to change it so it doesnt automatically make that first select, and only relies on the users selectionsp  pThanksp  pIn response to the comment of Darshan Joshi Apart from the autogenerated code, the only thing altered on the datagridview is setting AutoGenerateColumns to false, and setting the DataSource property. Ive placed a MessageBox.Show in my selectionchanged delegate, and it seems it even gets called thrice every time the datasource is set. Once just before the data is loaded, and twice after.p  pI cant set selected to false on load, since the datasource is set after certain user actions, not on initialization.p

However as per HTML specs the fieldset element isnt part of the form submission, so there would be some that would say adding a NAME to this element for this purpose, violates the specification.

Negative 73 pId like to distribute my program as a binary, not in source code form. I have two test systems An older Linux openSUSE 11.2 with glibc 2.10 and a recent one LinuxMint 13 with glibc 2.15.

Why is the program looking for glibc 2.11 as well Does this mean that my program will run on both glibc versions, i.e. 2.15 AND 2.11 So it requires at least 2.11 Or will it require 2.15 in any casep  pAnother question Is the assumption correct that glibc is upwards compatible but not downwards E.g. is a program compiled with glibc 2.10 guaranteed to work flawlessly with any future version of glibc If that is the case, what happens if a constant like PATHMAX is changed in the future Currently it is set to 4096 and Im allocating my buffers for the realpath POSIX function using the PATHMAX constant. Now if this constant is raised to 8192 in the future, there could be problems because my program allocates only 4096 bytes. Or did I misunderstand something herep  pThanks for explanations p

Negative 73 pSo I have a model heirarchy using multitable inheritance and I was wondering if there was a some sort of ModelForm or similar approach for creating an object like a normal model form and have the user choose which of the subclasses they want to use in the form in like a choice field.p  pThe heirarchy is as followp  precodeclass Basemodels.Model     field1  models.CharFieldmaxlength10     field2  models.CharFieldmaxlength20 class ABase     pass class BBase     pass class CBase     pass codepre  pI cant use Meta abstract models because I have one class that needs a foreign key to the Base which is why Im using multitable inheritance and in the future the child classes may have additional field. Do you have any suggestions of how I go about doing thisp  pCurrently the way Im doing it is using a normal form and having all the common fields in that form as well as a choice field which they can select the type of the model they want to use and then Ive created a save method which interprets the type from the choice field and creates the object of that type. I cant help but feel there is a better method of doing this.p

Negative 73 pstrongEditstrong Ive been reading on SO for about 3 hours so far and it still isnt making much sense to me meaning I emhaveem done my research before asking. Forgot to state that in the OQ.p  pAlright, Im completely at a loss with BigO and it makes almost no sense to me when trying to apply other methods of applying it to my code. If anyone can help, Id like a walkthrough of how to calculate the BigO of the following.p  precodeint i  0 int t  0 whilei lt 4      Basic instructions     int s  0     whiles lt 4          Basic instructions         t  2         ifconditions  Checks if a value isnt in a hashset             forint r  0 r lt t r                  Basic instructions                 ifconditions  This statement can make t equal to any number lt t, checks if two strings are identical.

Weve been told to show we understand complexitycorrectness in general, not BigO and how its applied, but not to apply it to our code since it would be way too complicated to do. Im only looking at doing this because I want to understand it better for the future. The above code is also a random example, not my actual code meaning Id still have to change it to fit anyway.p  pThanks in advance, we only looked at BigO for about 30 minutes in class and after a load of reading I think I confused myself too much. As I said, if that code isnt appropriate I can change it.p

Negative 73 pWe are looking to implement a documentation solution that would allow us to search all of our solutions and projects for potential reusable code.  An example would be services.

Negative 73 pIm used to working with Ruby  Rails and the ActiveRecord framework. One of the nice things about this framework is the migration strategy for defining DB schema. This means old versions of the database can always be upgraded automatically.p  pHowever now working with .NET Im looking to create a file format to store user data for projects. XML is the obvious choice and serialization in .NET to XML is trivial. However as the project ages the serialization strategy may need to be changed. Fields might need renaming or moving around or have their types changed.p  pThe use case is that a new version of the program has to load an old version of a project file this can happen automatically, perhaps with a message to the user that a migration of the file being loaded will occur.p  pIs there an existing serialization framework for .NET that can handle general schema versioning and migration or do I have to start from scratchp

Negative 73 pWe are trying to upgrade our MooTools installation from 1.2.4 to 1.2.6. The original developer included a more file with optional plugins, but because it is compressed we cant tell what was included in that file.

Negative 73 pAs said in the title, I follow Model First method. So my Model classes are Automatically generated. If I want mock the codeDBContextcode derived codeMyModelContainercode which contain codeDBSetscode of entity classes. Read some where that in order to unit test, you need to change it to codeIDBSetcode. Whether its possible to do it especially in a class that gets auto generated when I do Run Custom Tool is one concern. But as of now I modified it.p  pBut the real problem is when I try to Stub codeMyModelContainercode to return a mock generated from codeIDBSetcode. Rhino mock is firing an InvalidOperationException Invalid call, the last call has been used, or no call has been mademake sure that you are calling a virtualCOverridableVB method.p  pHere is my unit test code.p  precodeMyModelContainer dbMock  MockRepository.GenerateMockltMyModelContainergt IDBSetltModels.MyEntitygt entityMock  MockRepository.GenerateMockltIDBSetltModels.MyEntitygtgt dbMock.Stub xgtx.MyEntities .Return entityMock  codepre  pThe last statement is triggering the exception. I tried using the fake implementation of codeIDBSetltgtcode specified a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3463017unittestingwithef4codefirstandrepositoryherea, But no luckp  pI use MVC 4, Rhino Mocks 3.6. Any help will be appreciated.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pAfter some trials and research, I found a fix. I changed the code top  precodeMyModelContainer dbMock  MockRepository.GenerateMockltMyModelContainergt IDBSetltModels.MyEntitygt entityMock  MockRepository.GenerateMockltIDBSetltModels.MyEntitygtgt dbMock.Stub xgtx.MyEntities .Return entityMock  dbMock.MyEntities  entityMock codepre  pNow the codeInvalidOperationExceptioncode is gone. The test fails only due to codeExpectationViolationExceptioncode which should be normal.p  pAs for auto generated Model class, it is found out that editing the codeDbContextscode strongT4 template .tt extensionstrong will do the trick. Thanks to a hrefhttpmylifeandcode.blogspot.in201210unittestingwithmockentityframework.html relnofollowAlans Blogap  pemBut I want to know why the previous code didnt work. Anyoneemp
Negative 73 pIm trying to repeatedly play a audio continuously, without any gap. Ive tried,p  precodemediaplayer.setLoopingtrue codepre  pBut it gives a gap between repeat time. And tried this,p  precodemediaplayer.setOnCompletionListenernew MediaPlayer.OnCompletionListener       Override     public void onCompletionMediaPlayer mp              mediaplayer.start       codepre  pIt gives a gap also. Ive tried with different audio format. But neither way worked for me. Is there any other way in androidp
Negative 73 pIm trying to use jquery and ajax to update a mysql database.  I was able to add a new record and have the script append the html properly.  Now i need to add an ID to eacho row of the table so i can edit the information for any of the rows.  Im calling the function editCompanyid to pass the id to the script, but i cant get it to work.  p  pWhen I run the script, I get an error The value of the property editCompany is null or undefined, not a function objectp  pAny thoughtsp  precodelthtmlgt     ltheadgt         lttitlegtltsettings[title]gtlttitlegt             ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetiso88591gt

Negative 73 pi have several spans inside a row in twitter bootstrap. inside these spans are codelth3gtcode headers and then codeltimggtcode, codeltpgtcode, etc. some of theses headers may only have one or two words. some may have 5 or 6 words which causes greater height. this makes the remaining content look wonky on the page because the images are higher or lower than the rest. how can i make all of the header tags keep the same height based on the amount of content in the largest header or how can i make the content in the larger header shrink down to a size to keep the same height i dont think this last approach is really what i need. the smaller text would probably look as wonky as the initial problem.p  panother problem this causes is due to the amount of content that may be displayed at any time, i may have more spans than than the row calls for. IE 6 span4s. this makes the last two drop down and begin their own row inside the row. thats fine and needed, but if the second span4 drops lower than the others i end up with the two lower spans pushed to the right because they cant slip past that span. and if the third span is lower then i end up with one span to the far right and a third row with one span to the far left. bad wonkyp  pi need a css option that i can add to my own css file separate from the bootstrap and responsive css files. i have a class refering to these spans specificly for text color, etc. so it doesnt effect any other codelth3gtcode tagsp  pcodep  precodeltdiv classherounitgt lth1gtOpening This Weeklth1gt ltdiv classrowfluidgt     ltdiv classspan3 mobiletwogtlth3gtThe Incredible Burt Wonderstonelth3gtltimg srcimgadsincredburtwonderstoneonesht.jpggtltdivgt     ltdiv classspan3 mobiletwogtlth3gttest smalllth3gtltimg srcimgadsincredburtwonderstoneonesht.jpggtltdivgt     ltdiv classspan3 mobiletwogtlth3gtThe Incredible Burt Wonderstonelth3gtltimg srcimgadsincredburtwonderstoneonesht.jpggtltdivgt     ltdiv classspan3 mobiletwogtlth3gtThe Incredible Burt Wonderstonelth3gtltimg srcimgadsincredburtwonderstoneonesht.jpggtltdivgt     ltdiv classspan3 mobiletwogtlth3gtThe Incredible Burt Wonderstonelth3gtltimg srcimgadsincredburtwonderstoneonesht.jpggtltdivgt     ltdiv classspan3 mobiletwogtlth3gtThe Incredible Burt Wonderstonelth3gtltimg srcimgadsincredburtwonderstoneonesht.jpggtltdivgt     ltdiv classspan3 mobiletwogtlth3gtThe Incredible Burt Wonderstonelth3gtltimg srcimgadsincredburtwonderstoneonesht.jpggtltdivgt     ltdiv classspan3 mobiletwogtlth3gtThe Incredible Burt Wonderstonelth3gtltimg srcimgadsincredburtwonderstoneonesht.jpggtltdivgt     ltdiv classspan3 mobiletwogtlth3gtThe Incredible Burt Wonderstonelth3gtltimg srcimgadsincredburtwonderstoneonesht.jpggtltdivgt     ltdiv classspan3 mobiletwogtlth3gtThe Incredible Burt Wonderstonelth3gtltimg srcimgadsincredburtwonderstoneonesht.jpggtltdivgt     ltdiv classspan3 mobiletwogtlth3gtThe Incredible Burt Wonderstonelth3gtltimg srcimgadsincredburtwonderstoneonesht.jpggtltdivgt ltdivgt ltpgtThese movies open this Fridayltpgt ltpgtlta classbtn btnprimary btnsmall hrefcomingsoongtSee Showtimes ampraquoltagtltpgtltdivgt codepre  plink removedp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netisherwoodGyYMK1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netisherwoodGyYMK1ap

Negative 73 pI understand how to configure WCF programatically, but Im wondering if theres a way to force a WCF service to always ignore the configuration file andor to ignore parts of the configuration file.p  pId like to be able to restrict a service to using certain settings, such as ensuring it will only use a specific binding configuration whilst leaving some binding settings such as the address configurable. This means I have two options I can 1 Restrict specific settings as required if possible, or 2 Disable loading of the config file altogether and use my own custom config file that supports only the settings I need and use these as the basis on which to setup the bindings programatically based on these values.p  pI understand that with a selfhosted service I can at least iterate the binding settings and so forth and disableremovemodify those I am not interested in after they have been loaded but I believe this is only trivial for selfhosted services where you set up ServiceHost manually and Im wondering if its the only way to restrict configuration especially as I believe that having made the service do this there is nothing to stop someone taking the service library itself and using a different host such as IIS to load it with their own custom configuration.p  pI understand that the whole point of WCF is that its highly configurable and flexible and that this goes against this fundamental design goal of it somewhat so agree its not an ideal scenario but this isnt a requirement I have had any input over so any suggestions as to how it may be possible to limit configuration options as discussed above would be appreciated.p

Negative 73 pI am creating a native app for android using sencha touch 2.2.1p  pI want to integrate the feature of social media sharing Facebook and Twitter.p  pThe idea is ,there will be list of images and few buttons under each image. When the user clicks on the share button, Facebook and Twitter icons will popup and if user click on facebook, than that particular image will get posted on users wallif heshe is already logged in, otherwise will open facebook login window. Same will happen for Twitter.p  pI am able to implement this thing with sencha webapp. Becuase on the webapp, facebook is getting its fallback url and it posted the image successfully. But when I created an apk of my application then the sharing code is not working.p  pIt is showing error  URL not allowed........ I think it is an issue of fallback url.  I used facebook sdk also but it did not work for me. I also tried with combination of sencha Touch and Phonegap but still the same error as mentioned above. p  pPlease share if anybody implemented similar to this type of project. p
Negative 73 pSo I implemented Haystack with ElasticSearch a week ago within our BETA application. One thing I can notice is that getting some data large amount back to our users for example listing all the users within the application is much faster by going through Haystack then Djangos ORM. Now, I will be releasing a REST service with TastyPie to serve the possible tablets within the next weeks, as I want to be able to access the information from iPads, Nexus tablets and so on.p  pOne thing I was wondering, is when should I be querying the ORM vs HaystackElasticSearch For example, if the user on the tablet is requesting a specific set of users, should we let TastyPie query the ORM, or go to ElasticSearchp  pIf we look at this answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6072447djangohaystackorormDjango Haystack or ORMa, we can all agree that a DB is made to retrieve and write data. However, could we say that retrieving faster can be faster with HaystackElasticSearch once the search engine was updatedp  pI am a bit confused as to when, should we strongnotstrong be querying Haystack if it is much fasterp
Negative 73 pThis may be a general discussion instead of a real question. When I started using NSTableView and NSOutlineView, I thought  oh, a instance of NSView may do almost everything. So I return a NSView instance in my delegate and dataSource. p  pOf couse it did not work and I realized that NSTableView consitsts of instances of NSCell which inherits directly from NSObject. p  pI sensed that it may be important to understand why Cocoa constructed NSTableView based on NSCell but NSView.

Negative 73 pI need to setup cron jobs on a codeigniter site on a shared host that uses cpanel. The cron script works when run via a browser, however, I first tried running it in cron using curl and then wget, but neither of these worked. Ultimately I will want to run the jobs via phpcli. p  pAs for why the curl and wget methods dont work, could it have anything to do with the fact that the site is completely SSL, and htaccess is used to rewrite all http requests to https To be honest, I havent actually ruled out the fact that the host may have disabled cron for some strange reason.p  pEDIT Have checked with the host and cron is running finep  pI read an a hrefhttpstevethomas.com.auphphowtoruncronjobsincodeigniter.html relnofollowarticlea here about cron and CI CLI and it gives this examplep  precodeusrlocalbinphp f homeclinicpublichtmlindex.php cron foo codepre  pI have tried that method but my controler is inside a subdirectory eg controlersutilitycron.php and I have CI setup to not use the index.php So how would I run cron in this wayp

Negative 73 pI am new to Kendo Grid and trying to use the columnMenu option.  I need to access the column Menu function only the ability to showhide columns from a button outside the grid.  This link allows me to do that and it is working fine. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13637475howtoshowkendogridscolumnmenuusingscriptHow to show Kendo Grid39s columnMenu using scriptap  pBut this still retains the columnMenu option in the column headers which I do not need. So after looking into it further, I was able to remove the column headers on the load usingbr defaultGrid.thead.find[datafieldAddress].kheadercolumnmenu.removebr where Address is one of the columns in the grid. I still do need to have atleast one column with the columnMenu option, or else the solution in the above url does not work.p  pUsing the solution in the link above, it also removes the filter option on the columns.  What I need to achieve is remove the Column Menu from all the column headers and access the showhide column option from outside the grid and also have the filter option available to specific columns of the gridp  pIs this possible and how do I go about doing it  Please helpp

Negative 73 pDont get me wrong by looking at the question title  I know what they are format for portable executable files. But my interest scope is slightly differentp  pstrongMY CONFUSIONstrongp  pI am involved in rehostingretargeting applications that are originally from third parties. The problem is that sometimes the formats for object codes are also in .elf, .COFF formats and still says, Executable and linkable. p  pI am primarily a Windows user and know that when you compile and assemble your CC code, you get something similar to .o or .obj. that are not executable well, I never tried to execute them. But when you complete linking static and dynamic libraries and finish building, the executable appears. My understanding is that you can then go about and link that executable or bash test it with some form of script if necessary.p  pHowever, in Linux or UNIXlike systems there are .o files after you compile and assemble the CC code. And once the linking is done, the executable is in a.out format at least in Ubuntu distribution of Linux. It may very well be .elf in some other distrib. In my quick web search none of the sources mentioned anything about .o files as executables. p  pstrongQUESTIONSstrongp  pTherefore my question turns into the followingsp  p1 What is the emtrueem definitions for portable executables and object codep  p2 How is it that Windows and UNIX platform covers both executables annd object code under the same file format .COFF, .elf.p  p3 Am I misinterpreting Linkable My interpretation of Linkable is something that is compiled object code and can then be linked to other staticdynamic link libraries. Is this a stupid thoughtp  p4 Based on question 1. and perhaps 2 do I need to use symbol tables e.g. .LUM or .MAP files with object code then Symbols as in debug symbols and using them when rehosting the executablesobject files on a different machine.p  pThanks in advance for the right nudges.

Negative 73 pIm on a simple project to make a math game. So far everything good, the user can choose to multiply or add. Then recives a multiplication to solve or a addition, then is give feedback. But I wish to extend my game, I want to make some kind of countHighscore but not complicated only to give the user feedback in the simplest way, like if they get 5 answers correct in a row it will say in a textbox Congratulations youve got 5 points. Im not sure how to go further on with this project, simply I want it to be a python mathgame made in Tkinter with a count function for each correct answer. p  pIm using Tkinter amp Python 2.7 for this, further on I wish to make a tutorial on this project to post on youtube.

Negative 73 pOk, I have a simplified version of my nsi script see below.  In the A2 section, I copy a single executable to the specified installation path, create environment variables, then do a SendMessage which is supposed to make all currently running processes aware of the env change.

Specifically Windows is searching for altcontrol.exe.  To locate the file yourself, click Browse.p  pIf the environment variables already exist when you perform the installation, then the link works.  Even weirder, if you click on the start menu shortcut properties and make some trivial change like add and remove a space in the comment field then click apply, Windows seems to regenerate the AltControl.lnk file I know because the .lnk file increases in size even though no functional change was made through the dialog  and it works  So it seems like NSIS or some background Windows process in charge of generatingresolving .lnk files is not picking up on the newly created environment variables during the installation process.  Ive scoured the web and everything seems to indicate that the SendMessage Im using should force everything to be aware of the newly created env variables.  Thanks in advance to whoever can solve this mystery.  You can use the included installer.nsi script to replicate my situation.  Also note that it exhibits this behavior in multiple environments XP, Vista, 7, withwithout admin, etc..p

Negative 73 pIs this a bug in the latest version of chrome  29.0.1547.76 m When you raise an xmlhttprequest, lets say while downloading an image, you can see that the resource is downloaded with status code 200 OK in network tab, but the performance.getEntries or performance.getEntriesByNameresourceUrl doesnt list the resource entry.

Negative 73 pIn Java i am firing a command on the shell using Process builder and after firing that command i want to know its progress whether its complete or not. If the process invoked is taking too much time i want to kill that process after a certain time limit. e.g if the process is taking more than 5 sec to execute i want to kill that back end process and if its complete within 5 sec i want to continue using the output of that back end process. In python there is class variable called returncode which is initially null and then gets to 0 after the process has completed it execution and i can keep on checking that value and if its null after 5 sec i can simply kill that process. How can i do the same thing in Java  p

Negative 73 pThis is a really old subject about which much has been written, but I havent found exactly this spin on it so please bear with me.p  pAfter having spent a bit of time trying to get my head around the codenewcode and codef.prototypecode constructor constructs in JavaScript, and reading about how its a prototypal language, not to mention Crockfords illuminating comments on the subject, I have reached the conclusion that the following is a much more natural way to simulate traditional classbased inheritance in JavaScript, should one want top  precode emphasise that theres no superclass instead of writing A   var A  Create.objectnull   define the instance initializer, which half of what a constructor is A.init  functionx, y      this.x  x     this.y  y     return this    a method A.sum  function      return this.x  this.y    instantiate A var a  Object.createA.init3   a subclass var B  Object.createA  B.init  functionx, y, w      A.init.callthis, x, y     this.w  w     return this   B.weightedSum  function      return 1.0  this.w  this.x  this.w  this.y    instantiate B var b  Object.createB.init1, 2, 0.3   equivalent of instanceof var bInstanceOfA  A.isPrototypeOfb codepre  pWhat I like about this is that it exposes whats really going as there is clear separation between object creation which applies to both instantiation and subclassing and initialization which only applies to instantiation. Also there is symmetry between creating a base class and a subclass.  The code doesnt require externally defined functions or libraries, but isnt particularly verbose either.p  pMy question, therefore, is the following could those of you who have more experience with JavaScript tell me if there are problems with the approach that I am not considering, or if it is a good patternp

Negative 73 pIm charting the progress of a differential equation solver boundary value problem. Each iteration yields a complete set of function evaluations fx, which can then be plotted against x. Each graph is supposedly closer to the correct solution than the last until convergence is reached. A sequential colormap is used to make earlier graphs faded and later ones saturated.p  pThis works fine when the number of iterations is predeterminedp  precodeimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt  ax  plt.subplot111 cm  plt.getcmapOrRd ax.setcolorcycle[cm1.iiter1 for i in range1,iter2]   ax.plotx,y for k in rangeiter      iterative solve      ax.plotx,y codepre  pHowever, if I use a convergence criterion instead of a predetermined number of iterations, I wont be able to codesetcolorcyclecode beforehand. And putting that line after the loop doesnt work. p  pI know that I can store my intermediate results and plot only after convergence is reached, but this strikes me as heavyhanded because I really have no use for all the intermediate results other than to see them on the plot. p  pSo here are my questions 1. How do I change the colormap of the existing graphs after plotting This is easy in MATLAB. 2. How do I do the same thing with another collection of graphs emon the same plotem e.g. from a different initial guess, converging to a different solution without disturbing the first collection, so that two colormaps distinguish the collections from one another. This should be obvious with the answer to Question 1, but just in case.p  pMany thanks.p

Negative 73 pWhen passing data around in Android between Activities, for example, it seems that the primary accepted method is to use Bunldes and Parcelables.

So for proper initialization we used new with argument this.p  p3 If I am correct at point 2 above, what does happen to the previously allocated memory to object c as new will allocate new chunk of memory and assign the new address to c Garbage collectedp  p4 So from above points, we can say memory is allocated for the objects which are members of a containing class, at the time of object creation of the containing class. And we can directly assign value to them with out calling new on themp  p[I am from C background, and this does not happen in C. If a class is having pointer or reference to other class, we need to explicitly allocate memory for them.]p  pPlease, correct me where I am wrong or something is missing in my understanding.

Negative 73 pIn my production level application i am working on some issues related to unicode characters like chinesejapanese strings.p  pMy application has a starting program and a configuration file which sets up all the parameters which can be used by running jvm. This configuration file is passed as part of the command line args.p  pThe usecase in question being, i need to pass a config file content in namevalue pair format. The name of this config file has unicode characters i.e. Chinese in it. When i am running the application from the command prompt. I pass the complete config file path, where the name of the file when i copy looks like .conf. When i receive the file in my code its still in the format somepathand.conf. Eventually when i run this path through a file exists check if fails, i.e. new Filepath.isFilep  pSo i created a small program to test this scenario, the job of the program was to take a file path as part of the command line argument, print it and read the contents of that file. Here before running, it looks similar to above i.e. somepathand.conf, when it runs and prints the location, its still the same i.e. somepathand.conf. But when i debug it, i am able to see the right chinese characters plus its able to read the file and its contents.p  pSo i am not sure what is missingdifferent from my main application. Few things i have checked and tried out are, 1. Changed the encoding type of the command prompt to UTF8 via command chcp 650001. 2. Set the java property Dfile.encodingUTF8.p  pHowever that too hasnt helped. Operating System is windows 7, java version is 1.7.0.45.p  pAny pointers with respect to where to look and why a similar code with my small program works and does not with the main application.p  p One correction, the file being passed to the java program as part of the command prompt is of xml format. And has the encoding type set to UTF8, i.e. via .p  pSo the same file is passed to both the programs, in case of the simple file read class its working, while its not with the main application. Things different with the main application is, in addition to this xml file, there are other parameters passed along as well.p  pThanks,p  pVickyp

Negative 73 pAssume we have a clientserver application communicating over the net, with client side written in javascript so pretty much opensource. Lets say for example that we want to run multiplayer inbrowser game and gather some revenue from ads. We want to stay in business, so we keep secured the server part, which handles most of the logic, and we accept that frontendUI handling client is thrown into the wild and might be messed with by anyone.p  pQuestion is how to detect and prevent the situation where someone copies all public facing content of web app, including JS client, puts it on hisher own server with hisher own advertisements, potentially malware etc, while the hijacked client still talks to our original serverp  pOr perhaps thats just silly and there is some obvious reason why such behaviour would not work that might be why I havent found anyone mentioning it Im feeling like Im missing something there, but nothing in my experience so far tells me that hypothetical situation from the paragraph above would not be possible or even profitable for a highjacker.p

Negative 73 pemYes, I have thoroughly searched for an answer before asking my question... but havent found the right answer to my issue. I have read the MySQL man about user variables...

Its supposed to represent a uniform sampling of data stored as rows inserted 30 seconds apart over a given time span, in this case 2 weeks... this particular statement returns exactly 120 rows of data, which are then packaged by PHP and sent to the UI to be charted with the jqplot plugin...p  pEverything else works excellently well, except that within PHP  Im unable to execute multiple SQL statements, a process which I believe would be required to SET my user variable x, for use in the subsequent SELECT statement. Again, this SQL runs just fine when queried against my database using phpMyAdmin... p  pI do realize that generally speaking, within PHP, one cannot execute multiple SQL statements in a single query...p  pstrongIs it possible, however, to create a SINGLE SQL statement  as a string  that will fetch the same result set as that returned by MySQL using the phpMyAdmin tool and the SQL Ive listed abovestrong A single statement that I can pass to my newly created PDO inside my PHP and get the right number of rowsp  pSeems like PDOs are supposed to be able to handle such a scenario, at least thats what Ive gleaned from my study of this board...p  pIm sort of new to PHPMySQL, so Im ready to learn.

Negative 73 pp  Hi, im learning to create an android shoot game where i ll have multiple enemies. I must control the position on the screen and be able to delete each of then. p    But if i use the canvas, which is most recomended, is it possible to delete just one bitmap and not the entire canvas by delete i mean make it desapear from the screen, not just erase its value Another approach would be using the android image view, which can be deleted and as well controlled, but i think that can make my game run slow if i create various objects of a class enemy for example, am i right Thank you for your time.p

Negative 73 pIm working on an Android background subtraction project, with a moving camera. Im trying to use feature matching, findHomography and warpPerspective to find overlapping pixels between two frames. However, the output I get is slightly incorrect. Im quite new to image processing, so Im not familiar with all the terminology. I have 2 main issuesp  p1 The result of warpPerspective is overly distorted  e.g. the image is skewed, objects in the image are flipped, squished, etc. How do I solve this p  p2 I sometimes get an OpenCV Error Assertation failed error, which crashes my app. This error maps to warpPerspective. Notes the dimensions in image1 previous frame and image2 current frame are the same. I convert the images to gray before detecting features currently from RGB.

Negative 73 pSo basically I am trying to grab all these courses, throw them into a listview, and when you click on each item it will take you to another activity with a longer course description.

I have found very little tutorials, and this class is an experiment class, I have no prior java experience, dont ask me why this is our assignment, my professor is crazy in the face.p  pHeres the JSON that needs to be parsed, usually I see an identifier like name or number or something that you can pull and extract but since there is none I am just completely lost at how I am supposed to grab the course number for each course. We have no books, very little examples he gave us, none of them are really pertaining to this either. p  pHeres the courses JSON, no array name or identifiers, yet im supposed to be able to magically know how to grab them seperately p  pa hrefhttpiam.colum.eduportfolioapicoursejsontrue relnofollowhttpiam.colum.eduportfolioapicoursejsontrueap  pand then each course has a course number, so getting the json for that is just adding in that course number after course in the URLp  pa hrefhttpiam.colum.eduportfolioapicourse361600jsonTrue relnofollowhttpiam.colum.eduportfolioapicourse361600jsonTrueap  p361600 is the course number for that example.p  pI just would absolutely love SOME sense of direction on how to complete this.

Negative 73 pIm working on a program running in NodeWebkit, and I use jQuery for many other tasks. Now I have a settings.json file that I need to load upon the start of the program, and I was thinking about how to load it. p  pSo either I use the node.js fs functions to read the data from the file and then use JSON.parse to get the correct data in a javascript object, or I use the jQuery fnuction .getJSON which in one function gets the json file, parses it and returns a data object.p  pNow I was wondering, is there data on the speed of both Would the jQuery option be significantly slower if the settings.json file were to get larger e.g. when I add more settings or is the difference negligible Im assuming here that the jQuery way would be slower than the node.js way, since it would seem logical to me that an operation on the filesystem would be faster than a jQuery get request, but then again I could be wrong.p  pAnyone who can help me out with some information on this I have to add that Im fairly new to node.js, I understand what it does but Ive only been trying it out for about a week now so I havent done any substantial reading or research on any of it.p

Negative 73 pNot sure whats the best approach to do this and not even sure if its doable. I have PHP and MySQL, FreeSWITCH, FreeSWITCH PHP ESL setup on my server and a SIP phone number binded to the gateway. In the database I have a table storing pairs of phone numbers that I want to bridge calls between. A short version of the table looks like belowp  precode         Callee1      Callee2       1    1112223333    2223334444     2    6667778888    7778889999     3    1123581321    3455891442    codepre  pWhat Ive been trying to achieve is to build a automated call center with FreeSWITCH in a way that I can make an automated call to Callee1 in the table and play an IVR once Callee1 picks up. If Callee1 presses 1 I will bridge the the call to Callee2 so they can speak on the phone.p  pI was thinking about to setup a CronJob that fetches new rows from the table periodically then loop through them and use a hrefhttpswiki.freeswitch.orgwikiPHPESL relnofollowPHP ESLa to originate calls to Callee1. Something likep  precodesockgtapioriginate sofiagatewaymyProviderCallee1 ampivrmyivr codepre  pmyivrp  precodeltmenu namemyivr     greetlongsayThank you for filling out the form.     greetshortsayThank you.     ......     digitlen4gt   ltentry actionmenuexecapp digit1 parambridge sofiagatewaymyProviderCallee2gt ltmenugt codepre  pEverything seems fine up till now yet I ran into the problem of how to pass the corresponding Callee2s phone number to the IVR entry dynamically. Should I rewrite the ivr xml and do a reload for every pair I tried configuring the a hrefhttpswiki.freeswitch.orgwikiModxmlcurl relnofollowmodxmlcurla yet no luck. The fscli generates 405 not allowed error every time I try to reload IVR. I also checked out the HTTAPI seems it doesnt fit my need here as it requires using session. Any insight is appreciated.

Negative 73 pI have a wildfly war application at hands, which depends on a jar which starts its own JPA persistence container with Spring. This jar has its own codepersistence.xmlcode, with  only one persistence unit.

If you create a web worker with Emscripten, you end up with a brand new instance of Emscripten, and hence a new heap represented by a separate Javascript array.p  pAs Javascript doesnt have threads or shared memory, the only way I can split up work is with web workers. However, I dont want to have to serialise results as its really slow for the particular objects Im using, so need to find a way to allocate my intermediate results to a byte array before then in Javascript world passing a message back with a copy of this arrayp  pFrom the top level object thats fine, but internally its just using a regular new operator, which could again be anywhere in the heap.p  pThe other tricky thing is reading out these objects from the allocated byte array when I access it from a new heap  the internal pointers would be all messed up.p  pIve seen how its possible to write bump or offset allocaters, but I dont see how to get these to work transparently with an existing class structure that you dont want to change or cant change.p

If I load both datasets first into main memory, then start the render thread, everything works perfectly, but what I need now is to give the user the flexibility of loading and unloading the second dataset without affecting the first one.  so I have a button to load the first data set p  precode  void MyViewonbtnstartclicked           Load first data set from file and start the render thread      MyGLObject is a QGLWidget object     MyGLObjectgtData1  new DataSet1     ifMyGLObjectgtData1gtprocessCSVFilefilename.csv                  MyGLObjectgtinitRenderThread                codepre  pHere is what iniRenderThread doesp  precode   void MyGLWidgetinitRenderThread          doneCurrent     displayThread.initModelRender     displayThread.start      codepre  pdisplayThread is a subclass of QThread for which the run method goes likep  precodevoid DisplayThreadrun       MyGLObjectgtmakeCurrent      OPenGL and GLEW initialization here ....        ...       initialize first data sets VAO and VBO     glGenVertexArrays1, ampVaodata1     glBindVertexArrayVaodata1     glGenBuffers1, ampVbodata1     glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER, Vbodata1     glBufferDataGLARRAYBUFFER, sizeofvertices, vertices, GLSTATICDRAW     glVertexAttribPointer0, 3, GLFLOAT, GLFALSE, 0, 0     glEnableVertexAttribArray0     glBindVertexArray0       Only generate VAO and VBO for second dataset  no data there yet     glGenVertexArrays1, ampVaodata2     glBindVertexArrayVaodata2        glGenBuffers1, ampVbodata2     glBindVertexArray0       load shader here         ...      whiledoRendering              ifdoResize                  GLResizew, h         doResize  false                  glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT  GLDEPTHBUFFERBIT              setup model view matrix and pass it as shader uniform                       ...

I also tried the solution proposed a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20249506whentouseglbufferdatainopenglherea  by allocating memory in the slot and then calling glBufferSubData inside the render loop but still am getting nothing.  The only way it would render correctly is if I am calling glBufferData inside the  render loop which is very inefficient.  Is there anyway I can create the VBO and copy data to it only once when the slot is executed and not inside the render loopp  pEDIT I tried using qDebug to print something from the showSecondSet SLOT in displayThread, it is printing and all other function calls inside the slot are executing normally except for the OpenGL calls. I am guessing it has to do with current GL contextp

Negative 73 pI have had reports of users being unable to use an iOS app after updating via the App Store because the SQLite database in use by Core Data apparently becomes readonly. This occurs with a readwrite persistent store that is kept in the codeDocumentscode folder of the app bundle.p  pThe persistent store is created from scratch for each user the first time they log into the app. Its contents are maintained with a custom progressive managed object model migration. As it happens, there was no migration to perform for the most recent release, and thus the persistent store should be ready to open as soon as the app is launched.p  pThe error that we received from the users is the same, and it happens early in the process launch after the upgrade completes. The codeuserInfocode of the codeNSErrorcode object is what we captured in this casep  precodeNSSQLiteErrorDomain  264 NSUnderlyingException  error during prepareSQL for SQL string SELECT ZVERSION, ZUUID, ZPLIST FROM ZMETADATA  attempt to write a readonly database codepre  pDue to some shortcomings in what we are logging and how we are managing the log files, I do not know precisely when this happens in the process of opening the persistent store. We are using codeUIManagedDocumentcode but not sharing any documents via iCloud. I assume that the error occurs while opening an existing document package, but even that is a guess. Because of this, I made improvements to the logging for future releases.p  pThe closest I have come to reproducing the error is to use the file permissions 0444 on the codepersistentStoreshmcode file in the document package of an iOS simulator app installation and then try the codeSELECTcode statement using the codesqlite3code command line interface. The error in that case is codeSQLITECANTOPENcode rather than codeSQLITEREADONLYcode, so I am probably not on the right track with a theory about file permissions. From what I can tell, codeUIManagedDocumentcode automatically fixes file permissions anyway.p  pWhat I am wondering is if anyone has experienced behavior similar to this If so, is there any way to recover so that users do not have to go through the process of recreating the local data storep

the cookie is not considered after the timeout for me this code should have done the trick, but apparently it does not.p  pThanks in advance to everyone that reads this question.p  pstrongEditstrong Adding some info, im working with Asp.net Mvc 2, the idea of the code is to recognize wether if the user is in a mobile or web environment, to show him the appropiate timeout page styled for each of them, as all my variables died after timeout, cookies were my only option left, Idk why i cant use Request.cookies or response.cookies directly, it only allows me to use

Negative 73 pI am building  an ASP.NET Azure Web Application Web Role which controls access to files stored in Azure Blob Storage. On  a GET request, my HttpHandler authenticates the user and creates a Shared Access Signature for this specific  file and user with a short time frame say 30 mins. The client is a media player which checks for updated media files using HEAD, and if the Lastmodified header differs, it will make a GET request. Therefore I do not want to create a SAS url but rather return LAstmodified, Etag and Contentlength headers in response to the HEAD request. Is this bad practice In case the file is up to date, there is no need to download the file again and thus no need to create a SAS url.p  pExample request p  precodeGET testblob.zip Host myblobapp.azurewebsites.net Authorization Zm9vYmFy codepre  pResponse p  precodeHTTP1.1 303 See other Location httpsmyblobstorage.blob.core.windows.netblobcontainertestblob.zipSHAREDACCESSSIGNATUREDATA codepre  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 73 pIm trying to run a ssis package on a remote integration server using dtutil which is being called within a stored procedure using cmdshell.  I now this isnt the best way to run a ssis package but its what I have inherited.

Negative 73 pI am using ngrepeat for iterating through a list of objects, and for each item in the list there are child objects which are edited in a Bootstrap modal popup. I am unable to use the Angular modal service as it conflicts with the Bootstrap CSS already in use on the page. Angular modals would let me take values back from the modal popup on modal close, but I am unable to use it due to existing code.p  pTo work around this problem, I am passing the child object to the function that opens the modal popup.  In this function, I assign this passed object to an Angular modeljQuery Object say x either way I tried, it gives same result so that I can update this new object x with the changes done in the modal popup.p  pI believe that these variables as copied and points to the same object, when I update one, it should update the other one and so my original Angular model should be updated as well. But, to my surprise, the original model is not updating until I open the modal popup again. When I open the modal popup again, it does not update variable x but merely is updated with the ngmodel I use on page.p  pTo debug this further, I printed my ngmodel on page and it is not updated till modal popup is opened again. To contrast this further if I alert length of this ngmodel, it is updated shows the changes I made in modal popup but the ngmodel object on page does not show new values.p  pI understand this is more of a theory and less code but I am not sure what part of my code would help find the problem. Kindly let me know and I will try sanitize my code and share.p  pUpdate While further digging, it looks like the model is updated but it did not reflect on page. So if for example on page I have condition that if no child objects, show Add button edit otherwise, it does not change from add to edit button when I open modal first time and add values to child objects. When I open modal popup again, it changes link from add to edit even if I close modal popup without changes. So it is a problem with screen refreshing as such my model updates reflecting on screen instead of actual model update.p

Negative 73 pI see that there are three distinct ways of passing an object to a function in C. Assuming my class to be like thisp  precodeclass Test      int i public     Testint x     int getX     void setXint num   TestTestint x      i  x   int TestgetX      return i   void TestsetXint num    i  num  codepre  pthese three signatures can pass an object of class codeTestcode to the methodp  precodevoid tempTest obj      obj.setX100   void permTest obj      objgtsetX150   void noideaTest ampobj      obj.setX150  codepre  pAs it turns out, the second and third methods impact the caller, the same object i being modified inside the function, whereas in the first one, it juts makes a bitwise copy of the object, and thus doesnt impact the caller if the copy modifies pointer members or resources, it can impact the caller.p  pBarring this, is there any other difference in the signatures p  pAnd can someone explain the 3rd signature I can understand the second, you call it like codeint retVal  permampobjectcode, where codeobjectcode is of class codeTestcode. The address is captured by codeobjcode in the function parameter, since it is the address of an object of class codeTestcode, the type is a pointer to object of class codeTestcode, thus using indirection to access its members. But how does the third signature work, and what exactly is passed to it when codenoideaobjectcode is called, and what exactly is the type of codeobjcode int the function parameterp

This is also nasty because you are not able to scroll the GridView during ist update..p  pThis is my CustomAdapterp  precodepublic CustomAdapterDialogBox dialogBoxActivity,ListltDrawablegt importedscaledimages, ListltStringgt importedlabels, int position      this.context  dialogBoxActivity     this.scaledImage  importedscaledimages.toArraynew Drawable[importedscaledimages.size]     this.labels  importedlabels.toArraynew String[importedlabels.size]     this.usedcells  position     inflater  LayoutInflater context.getSystemServiceContext.LAYOUTINFLATERSERVICE    public void updateGridListltDrawablegt importedscaledimages, ListltStringgt importedlabels, int position      this.scaledImage  importedscaledimages.toArraynew Drawable[importedscaledimages.size]     this.labels  importedlabels.toArraynew String[importedlabels.size]     this.usedcells  position     this.notifyDataSetChanged     Log.eupdate,true   Override public void notifyDataSetChanged       TODO Autogenerated method stub     super.notifyDataSetChanged     Log.enotify,true   Override public int getCount       TODO Autogenerated method stub     return usedcells   Override public Object getItemint position       TODO Autogenerated method stub     return position   Override public long getItemIdint position       TODO Autogenerated method stub     return position   public class Holder       ImageView img     TextView tv      public HolderImageView img, TextView tv          this.img  img         this.tv  tv         Override public View getViewfinal int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent       TODO Autogenerated method stub     ImageView img     TextView tv     TextView tvabc      ifconvertView  null          convertView  inflater.inflateR.layout.customadapterviewlayout, null         img  ImageView convertView.findViewByIdR.id.img         tv TextView convertView.findViewByIdR.id.tv         tvabc  TextView convertView.findViewByIdR.id.tvnormalportraitabc         convertView.setTagnew Holderimg,tv      else          Holder holder  Holder convertView.getTag         img  holder.img         tv  holder.tv         tvabc  holder.tvabc                   img.setImageDrawablescaledImage[position]             tv.setTextlabels[position]             notifyDataSetChanged     return convertView  codepre  pp  pAnd on my Activity i have the updateGrid and i call it in a TimerTask on MainThreadp  precodeprivate void updateGrid      customAdapter.updateGridimages, labels, position  codepre  pWhats Happening is that the GridView stays empty. Maybe its because Position is 0 while im Setting the baseadapter to the gridview. But this cant be the Problem because when im updating it should recognize the new size in getCount. Once again, the logic works well. Images where added and the methods updateGrid and notiyDataSetChanged are called as i want to. But the GridView stays like, i dont like showing These Images.completely empty.p  pHope something can provide a good solution. I appreciate every help and every improvement of the code i posted above.regarding to Performance or whatever. Thank youp  pUpdate Position  is my variable which Counts the cells which are available. Because some cells are emptynull. Due to that i dont know how much cells will be filledbecause i sort the Images alphabeticallyfor each row  some cells are filled with null i cant provide the BaseAdapters getCount method a number before my logic hasnt finishedp

Negative 73 pIm trying to create a basic snakelike game using Swift, but im having trouble making the tail of the snake follow the head. I know the traditional way is to delete the tail, and place a new snake part at the top of the snake in order to simulate movement, only changing the first and last parts of the snake array. The problem Im running into, is that because my game is not gridbased, the movement is more continuousfluid, and Im having trouble adjusting for the snake body movement. p  pBelow is one of my snake movement methods, as well as the method to adjust the body accordingly. My logic is to move the head, and then have all of the body parts adjust accordingly, however its not working as planned. Im very new to SpriteKit and this is my first attempted game. If someone could explain the logic given the fluid snake movement and gridless environment, I would really appreciate it.

Negative 73 pIm writing a simple java application and trying to add a feature to addremove a school Class. p  pI have a Hashmap to store each Class. The class object has a name String and  of criteria int. When I add the Class object to my Hashmap I also add the Class name and criteria to a JTable.p  pThe problem comes in when trying to remove a Class. I can easily remove it from the JTable by getting the selected item, and removing it however, I cant remove the Class from my Hashmap by name or criteria alone, because some classes may have the same name, or same number of criteria. Ive tried adding a unique class ID to each class so I can remove it like that, but it isnt nice to look at the class ID in the JTable.p  pIs there a better way to do all this Thank you.p

Negative 73 pI am creating an intranet that uses ASP.NET, but also has a features in a WPF app that is launched with ClickOnce. I would like to use WCF for communication between this WPF app and my ASP.NET server.p  pHere is the problem I want a user to be able to log in to the ASP.NET MVC website, and those credentials carry into the ClickOnce app so that it can use those same credentials for WCF without having to relogin.p  pSo, Bob goes to the website, possibly from an offsite PC, and gets the standard Windows Authentication prompt. He logs in, it does the NTLM handshake, and off he goes browsing the ASP.NET pages. What I want is when Bob opens the ClickOnce app, the Bobcredentials get passed into app as a URL parameter and the app seamlessly uses the Bobcredentials to createopen the WCF channel so that the WCF service on the ASP.NET server side runs as Bob.p  pThis is the closest thing I could find a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3096267howdoyoupassusercredentialsfromoneprocesstoanotherforimpersonationiHow do you pass user credentials from one process to another for Impersonation in .NET 1.1a It talks of using SSPI and passing tokens to the client app, but not in the WCF context.

Negative 73 pSo Im trying to create a custom SeekBar.

So if condition depends on Command line argument which can be between 1 and 50. I need some optimal way to avoid writing if condition 50 times.p
Negative 73 pI want to plot a spectrogram which shows the frequency dependence of the power of a waveform along with its dependence of a controllable parameter param which is held constant across each individual experiment. Each experiment produces a time waveform. Here is some code to illustrate what I want. Basically what I want is a spectrogram plot with frequency on the y axis and the above mentioned parameter value on the x axis. Since I can only vary the value of my parameter discretely a finite number of times, I wish to use a suitable interpolation method to give the effect of continuously sweeping through the parameter space on my spectrogram plots.p  precodeGenerate some example data for an experiment which outputs a time waveform which is dependent on our choice of param  a controllable variable.

Negative 73 pSo I am currently using the codep  precodemystring  sampamp38g    codepre  pTo find and replace all ampersands codeampcode in my string variable, and replace them with the XML entity reference for ampersands codeamp38code. The problem is, I want to only replace ampersands that are NOT already part of an XML entity reference.p  pFor example, say I did a find and replace before that to make all codegtcode to be codeamp62code.p  pThat has an ampersand, but I dont want the first bit of code to replace that, since it is followed by code62code. p  pIt may not be enough to exclude codeampcode, as there is a slight chance that may be legitimately in the data. So can I in regex exclude where the ampersand is followed by codecode p  pAlternatively, the specific three examples I want to exclude are codeamp44code comma, codeamp62code codegtcode, and codeamp60code codeltcode. Those are the only other find and replaces I will be doing, so if there is a way to exclude those specifically, that would work too.p  pThanksp

Negative 73 pFineUploader is great But I have such a problem I use React Bootstrap as my UI framework. I need upload button, but after user selects some image file, they need to deal with the image first in a modal dialog window of React Bootstrap, perhaps rotate it, or scale it, or crop it, etc. And when user clicks Finish button, then the image should be uploaded to the Node.js server, and display progress bar in the modal dialog body. After the server has received all of the file, then the modal dialog should be closed.p  pI read through the code of FindUploader, but cant find what I need. FineUploader do have FineUploaderBasic class, with it I can pass the upload button element. But I cant turn the FineUploaderBasic object into FineUploader object, and initialize the template when the modal dialog open. I cant just make the template invisible first, and display it when the modal open. Because React Bootstrap wont add modal into the DOM before user opens the modal.p  pSo should I define a new method to turn a FineUploaderBasic object into a FineUploader object Or is there any other way to make it p

But what happens if an exception arises in one the the tasks  This exception is captured and when codeWaitcode is called it is given to us. Since, the default timeout of codeReceiveAsynccode method is 1 min, it is highly possible to receive TimeoutException, because worker may finish its job later and no message for this session will exists in the queue. I found many examples, where people catch this type of exception, consume it, and try again the receive  they give another minute of time to worker to finish the job. How can I accomplish this in my scenario. Thank youp

Secondly, my code appears to work, but I want to confirm I am doing this in an efficient manner and not leaving myself open to security breaches.p  pFirstly, I use PHP passwordhash when adding user to admin tablep  precodestmt  dbhgtprepareINSERT INTO admin username, password VALUES username, password stmtgtbindParamusername, username stmtgtbindParampassword, password  password  passwordhashpassword, PASSWORDDEFAULT codepre  pSecondly, when a user attempts to login, I retrieve users from the admin table by matching the username ONLY, as I couldnt see a way to check the hash during the query this is the part I am unsure if there is a better way, and also define the password variable from the POST inputp  precodestmt  dbhgtprepareSELECT  FROM admin WHERE username  username     stmtgtbindParamusername, username     username  POST[username]      define password for use in password verify     password  POST[password] codepre  pThirdly, if there is a result from the query, I run passwordverify on the user input to check for a match, and then I branch depending on true or false.p  precodeif row  stmtgtfetchPDOFETCHASSOC              if passwordverifypassword, row[password]                  sessionstart                 foreach row as user                      SESSION[user]  row[id]                               else                  errors  true                                                 headerlocation leads.php                  else              errors  true          codepre  pI know there are many different ways to hash  secure passwords, but using the native passwordhash functions is the way I decided to go, my question is have I done it right  is there a better wayp  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 73 pI have a mesos cluster with marathon and everything running in docker. I want to deploy production mysql and mongodb servers and am trying to figure out the best way to do service discovery.p  pOption 1 is to use the existing setup which proxies everything through an haproxy server sitting on one of the masters. My issue with this is that every query must make two hops, from app machine to master machine to db machine, even if the query originated on the machine the db is on. Is this actually significant or am I being pedantic p  pOption 2 is to use mesos dns which I have set up but never used. This would require running the mysql docker image in host networking mode or adding 3306 to the ports a mesos slave can offer then immediately claiming 3306. I would then be able to use mysql.marathon.mesos as the host of any connection.p  pOption 3 would be to deploy the same haproxy server on every machine and use an apps local haproxy to send the queries to the right place. This seems a little bit better than option 1 because the first hop is always on the same machine but will require significantly more work to set up.p  pHas anyone done this before What is the right pattern for these types of servicesp

Negative 73 pIm wondering what the correct pattern for implementing Mutable vs Immutable data structures would be. I understand the concept and how it works, but how should I implement if using an underlying Cocoa data structure I mean, if I use a codeNSSetcode, for instance. Lets say I have the followingp  precode MyDataStructure.h interface MyDataStructure  NSObject property nonatomic, strong, readonly NSSet  mySet end    MyDataStructure.m interface MyDataStructure  property nonatomic, strong NSMutableSet  myMutableSet end  implementation MyDataStructure   NSSet mySet      return [myMutableSet copy]   end codepre  pThe only reason Im using a mutable set as the underlying data structure,is so that the mutable version of this class can tamper with it. codeMyDataStructurecode per se does not really need a mutable set. Therefore, assuming that I have implemented some initialisers to make this class useful, heres how codeMyMutableDataStructurecode looks likep  precode MyDataStructure.h same .h as before interface MyMutableDataStructure  MyDataStructure   voidaddObjectidobject  end   MyDataStructure.m same .m as before implementation MyMutableDataStructure   voidaddObjectidobject      [self.myMutableSetaddObjectobject]   end codepre  pBy using this pattern the underlying data structure is always mutable, and its immutable version is just an immutable copy or is it.p  pThis also begs another question that arises when implementing the codeNSCopyingcode protocol. Heres a sample implementationp  precode idcopyWithZoneNSZone zone      MyDataStructure  copy  [MyDataStructure allocWithZonezone]     copygtmyMutableSet  [myMutableSet copyWithZonezone]      return copy  codepre  pDoesnt codecopyWithZonecode return an immutable copy if that applies So Im basically assigning a codeNSSetcode instead to a codeNSMutableSetcode property, isnt that rightp  pEdit While diving deeper into the issue I found some more issues surrounding this concern.p  ol licodemySetcode should be codecopycode instead of codestrongcode.li liMy codecopyWithZonecode implementation isnt right either. I didnt mention it in the first post but that implementation relates to the Immutable version of the data structure codeMyDataStructurecode. As Ive read, Immutable data structures dont actually create a copy, they just return themselves. That makes sense.li liBecause of 2., I needed to override codecopyWithZonecode in the Mutable version codeMyMutableDataStructurecode.li ol  pTo make things clearp  precode MyDataStructure.h property nonatomic, copy, readonly NSSet  mySet codepre  pAndp  precode MyDataStructure.m implementation MyDataStructure   idcopyWithZoneNSZone zone       We dont really need a copy, its Immutable     return self    idmutableCopyWithZoneNSZone zone       I also implement mutableCopyWithZone, in which case an actual mutable copy is returned     MyDataStructure  copy  [MyMutableDataStructure allocWithZonezone]     copygt myMutableSet  [myMutableSet mutableCopyWithZonezone]      return copy   end  implementation MyMutableDataStructure   idcopyWithZoneNSZone zone      return [self mutableCopyWithZonezone]   end codepre  pIt seems tricky at first, but I think Im getting the hang of it. So the remaining questions arep  ol liIs the pattern correctli liDoes the getter for codemySetcode return a mutable or immutable instanceli linot listed before Do I really need the codecopycode signal when using the codecopycode property attributeli ol  pI appreciate your patience to read this far.

Negative 73 pI have written c code using linux sockets. I am creating a TCP server socket, bind, listen, accept and its a blocking thread. It waits for a connection and accepts properly. At this time I spawn off a thread to handle the connection and the server thread goes back to accept and waits. All is well. I have a custom keepalive protocol and in 3 seconds if the server does not send a keepalive packet, I delete the thread and close the socket and the client is disconnected. Now here is the problem. When I try to connect to the server again, the server will refuse my connection. I have to restart my program in order for my computer to connect again. I do not understand this. I am running the server on a VM using bridge connection and connecting from terminal on macosx using telnet, ip and port number. p  pHow can I get my server to allow the connection again after it disconnects p  precodeinclude SocketManager.h include ltiostreamgt include ltcstdlibgt include ltstring.hgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltunistd.hgt  static SocketManager pSocketManager  NULL  define

Negative 73 pIt is my understanding that Picasso offers both Memory Caching and Disk Caching... I have turned on Picassos Indicator which shows the different colors in the corner of the image based on where they are loaded from i.e. red  server, green  memory I think blue should be disk.p  pThis is my problem, there are never any images being loaded from disk, only server and memory. When I kill the app process and reopen it, all images are loaded from server again.p  pHow can I make Picasso save images to disk after they are initially downloaded from the server  My server returns the proper Cache headers so that is not the problem. p  pIf it helps, I am using Volley to request data from the server. I have tried to use Volleys NetworkImageView but had the same outcome.p  pAny help is appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 73 pFor this project one of the things we needed to do was click on an image and have it play a sound. I know the sound works and can be played because I made a simple program to open a window and play the sound. I think something is wrong with the clicking and the sound interacting but I cannot figure out why.

Negative 73 pIm studying operating system on a hrefhttpcodex.cs.yale.eduaviosbookOS9 relnofollowthis booka and my profs slides. Im arrived at the Process scheduling algorithms chapter. Talking about the RoundRobin RR algorithm i found some inconsistencies. I understand that is a preemptive version of the FCFS algorithm with a timeslice quatum. From now on, I will use the following notationp  precode1  profs version 2  books version 3  other version codepre  pHeres the inconsistency suppose a quantum of 100msp  pcode1code The RR uses two queue Q1, Q2p  ul liQ1 queue for processes that did not end their quantumli lipQ2 queue for processes that did end their quantump  ol liThe scheduler takes the process from the head of Q1 li liIf the process ends before the quantum expires, the process release the CPU on purpose and the scheduler takes the next process from Q1li liIf the process doesnt end before the quantum expires, is preempted and placed at the end of Q2li liWhen a process is emreadyem its placed at the end of Q1li liWhen Q1 is empty, Q1 and Q2 are swappedli olli ul  pSo when a process is blocked for an IO request e.g. after 30ms and its quantum is not expired yet, is placed at the end of Q1 I guess and when it will be scheduled again it will use the CPU for his remaining time 70ms in this case.p  pcode2code The book did not talk about emmultiple queuesem, so I assume it will use just one queuep  ol liThe scheduler takes the process from the head of the ready queueli liIf the process ends before the quantum expires, the process release the CPU on purpose and the scheduler takes the next process from the ready queueli liIf the process doesnt end before the quantum expires, is preempted and placed at the end of the ready queueli ol  pcode3code a hrefhttpswww.cs.rutgers.edupxk416notes07scheduling.html relnofollowSourceap  ol liThe scheduler takes the first process in the ready queueli liIf the process ends before the quantum expires, the process release the CPU on purpose and the scheduler takes the next process from the ready queueli liIf the process doesnt end before the quantum expires, is preempted and placed at the end of the ready queueli liIf the process is blocked by a IO request, its placed in a emwaiting queueem and when it will became emreadyem will be placed again in the ready queueli ol  pTo me, these are 3 different implementations of the RR scheduling algorithm. I think that the most valuable is the code3code because the code1code can cause a starvation if the process is placed in Q2 and new processes keep coming in Q1, then the process will never be scheduled again and code2code will waste CPU time when a process is blocked for an IO request. So, my question is which one is emthe right oneemp

Negative 73 pIs there a way to adjust the thickness of the scrollbars of a WebView using the stylesheet used by the whole JavaFX applicationp  pI am a bit confused sincep  ul lion the one hand I read that the scrollbars are not part of the JavaFX UI control and therefore can only be customized by a stylesheet set on the web engine webview.getEngine.setUserStyleSheetLocation.. which means I have to write another CSS trying that the scrollbars look like all other scrollbars in the applicationli liand on the other hand I can see that the scrollbars are obviously correctly customized using the JavaFX CSS except the thickness of the scrollbars and that the vertical scrollbar is always shown even if the loaded page requires no scrollbars at allli ul  pSo where am I wrong and which is the correct way to solve this problemp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 73 pI want to provide my users with the ability to lock in their rate for X number of years. However, this is not possible with Stripe API or Cashier. That is why I will have to do it on my application end. To do this I will need a subscribedat column. I know I can get it straight from Stripe customers subscription field currentperiodstart but it takes too much time to retrieve it and I will need this functionality quite a lot. So, in my subscriptions table, where I have all of Cashiers needed fields stripeid, stripeactive, ..., subscriptionendsat I want to add this subscribedat column. Now, I want to automatically update this value anytime a subscription is create, resume, or cancel. On cancel I need to set the value to NULL.p  pI dont want and its not a good practice to modify Cashiers code. In StripeGateway.php there is a method updateLocalStripeData which fires exactly for these three options but as I said I dont want to modify it.p  pI cannot override the StripeGateway.php method updateLocalStripeData because my Subscription Model does not extend it.p  pSo far the only solution that worked but which I dont really like is to use Model events saving and there retrieve the subscriptions currentperiodstart field and insert it into my Subscription Models subscribedat field.p  pWhat other ways to do thisp
