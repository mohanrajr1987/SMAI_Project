Positive 1449 pI have an Excel 2010 data file with over 200 variables columns, and over 1,000 records rows, each identified with a unique id number.  However, Im suspicious that some of these records are fabricated, i.e., someone took an existing record, replicated it, and changed only a few numbers to make it a little different.  Therefore, I need to produce a matrix that will show me the numberpercent of same values between each record and all other records e.g., record 1 and record 2 share 75 equal values, record 1 and record 3 share 57 equal values, record 2 and record 3 share 45 equal values, etc..  I have a few workarounds, but they take hours and dont produce a simple matrix.  I dont care about the difference between the values  just whether they are equal or not.  Any ideas will be greatly appreciatedp

Positive 1449 pI am trying to create a drill down hierarchy that will allow the user to click a cell that has a division like South and then below that group of divisions will be all the regions in South.

Positive 1449 pI know that I can copy a column containing evaluated formulas, paste it into an adjacent column, and specify to paste values i.e., a text string, so that the value sticks and I can then select, copy, and edit the value text as I desire.  However, I would like a more direct way to produce an editable column of values.  p  pIn order of preference, I would be satisfied if I could either p  p1 simply emcopyem the values directly from the formulacontaining cells by specifying a copy modeoption instead of having to specify a paste modeoption so that if I want to paste the values outside Excel, for example, I can do so directly  I believe this is not possible but would like to know if I have overlooked somethingp  p2 write the formulas in a way that throws the evaulated values to other cells, overwriting whatever is in those other cells as needed, but passing no trace of the formula itself to the other cellsp  p3 use a worksheet macro that runs in the background and automatically copies values from column A into column B whenever column A values are updated orp  p4 perform some operation on the formula column that removes the formulas but leaves the editable values with the obvious drawback that you cant reuse the formulas once they are gone.p  pWhich of these are possible  p

Positive 1449 pIm new to VBA, Im struggling with a piece of code, and Im hoping someone can help. I have a series of 78 tables, each with 1 column, in Sheet 1 of Workbook 1 ThisWorkbook, named Table A through Table BZ, respectively. Each table is the source for a corresponding named range, TableA through TableBZ that Im using to drive a series of dependent dropdowns on Sheet 2.p  pI have figured out the code to copy and paste values from Workbook 2 into each of the 78 tables in Workbook 1, one table at a time, effectively refreshing the available choices in the dependent dropdowns. If the number of values pasted from Workbook 2 is greater than the size of the table in Workbook 1, the table in Workbook 1 is automatically resized to fit the updated dataset. If the number of values pasted from Workbook 2 is less than the size of the table in Workbook 1, the table needs to be resized so that blank values dont show up in the dependent dropdowns.p  pI started by trying to include the resize the table within the copy  paste loop but couldnt seem to get the variables defined properly and struggled with choosing between the Range.Resize and ListObjects.Resize methods. Ive now tried to create a second loop to go through all the tables and resize one at a time after all the copying  pasting is done. Is there any difference in the two approachesp  pI can resize Table A with the following code, but it doesnt progress to Table B in the next loop i  2.p  precodeDim CurrentTable As ListObject i  1 Do     ThisWorkbook.Activate     Set CurrentTable  ActiveSheet.ListObjects1     CurrentTable.Resize RangeN1N10     i  i  1 Loop Until i  78 codepre  pI also need to resize each table to an appropriate number of rows, so I tried including another range variable. The following code does not resize Table A and gives me an Applicationdefined or objectdefined error on CurrentTable.Resize RangeTableRangep  precodeDim TableRange As Range Dim CurrentTable As ListObject i  1 Do     ThisWorkbook.Activate     Set CurrentTable  ActiveSheet.ListObjects1     Set TableRange  RangeCurrentTable.Resize CurrentTable.Range.Rows.Count, 1     CurrentTable.Resize RangeTableRange     i  i  1 Loop Until i  78 codepre  pI thought that the Rows.Count in the Resize range might be messing it up, but ResizeCurrentTable.Range.Rows,1 gives me the same error.p  pSo I need some combination that will resize the CurrentTable to the number of rows that contain data and then move to the next table in the series.p  pAny suggestions would be much appreciatedp

Positive 1449 pI have worked on several projects now where I have been stumped by MS Excel and MS Access where I cannot use VBA to manipulate objects whilst in design view. They are very simple tasks such as changing the name of the labels on a userform in MS Excel or adding new textboxes to a report in MS Access but they seem to be impossible as any macro will only be used upon activation of said userform or report and so everything is just done in runtime.p  pTo focus on one, In MS Excel I want to be able to run a code which will go through all the labels on my userform and rename them from Label1, Label2, etc... to Lbl1, Lbl2, etc... for instance but I cannot just click a button to run a macro on the design of the userform which would run through all the labels and change their names. If I am able to do this then I can be much more efficent with the rest of my runtime code. Without it, I have the option of renaming every single label I have but there are near 100 labels and I want to do this through VBA as I already can see that it would be very useful to know how to run code in design view of these Visual Basic elements.p  pPlease could you advise whether it is possible to manipulate these VB objects in design viewp

Negative 1449 pThis seems like perhaps a naive question, but I got into a discussion with a coworker where I argued that there is no real need for a cache to be threadsafesynchronized as I would assume that it does not matter who is putting in a value, as the value for a given key should be constant in that it is coming from the same source ultimately. If the values can change readily, then the cache itself does not seem to be all the useful in that if you care that the value is currently correct you should go to the original source.p  pThe main reason I see to make at least the GET synchronized is that if it is very expensive to miss in the cache and you dont want multiple threads each going out to get a value to put back in the cache. Even then, youd need something that actually blocks all consumers during a readfetchput cycle. p  pAnyhow, my working assumption is that a hash is by its very nature threadsafe because for any key,value combination, the value is either null or something that it doesnt matter who go there first to write. p  pQuestion is Is this a reasonable assumptionp  pUpdate The real scope of my question is around very simple idvalue style caches or parameterscalculated value where no matter who writes to the cache, the value will be the same and we are just trying to save from recalculatinggoing back to the database. The actual graph of the object isnt relevant and the cache is generally longlived.p
Negative 1449 pWhy does the jvm require around 10 MB of memory for a simple hello world but the clr doesnt. What is the tradeoff here, i.e. what does the jvm gain by doing thisp  pLet me clarify a bit because Im not conveying the question that is in my head. There is clearly an architectural difference between the jvm and clr runtimes. The jvm has a significantly higher memory footprint than the clr. Im assuming there is some benefit to this overhead otherwise why would it exist. Im asking what the tradeoffs are in these two designs. What benefit does the jvm gain from its memory overheadp

Negative 1449 pMy application consists of a codeUIImageViewcode inside a codeUIScrollViewcode, and I display a big image inside of it. The scroll view allows the user to pinch to zoom inout in the image, and that all seems to work just fine.p  pHowever, when my application is terminated and then relaunched, the codeUIScrollViewcode displays the image again in the original zoom level which is currently set to display the whole image, by scaling it in a aspect fit mode.p  pI would really like to be able to relaunch my app and have the codeUIScrollViewcode reopen with the same parameters as it was set when the app terminated. So if my image is currently zoomed in to the max, and scrolled all the way to the bottom left of it, that should be the view when I open the app again.p  pHow can I do thisp

Negative 1449 pHi all What is the best practice for connecting a single data class which houses all information and communication to a UI coded in XAML I am of course talking about the controller in MVC.p  pThis one class, call it Manager, exposes certain functionality such as Login and GetNetData etc. The UI is entirely in XAML, so it seems easy to simply code in handlers directly for the components.

Negative 1449 pI have a couple of projects hosted on Codeplex. Since I didnt really have a clue about anything but TFS when I created them, I used that. But, now I have gotten more comfortable with TortoiseSVN and VisualSVN so I would like to use that instead.p  pOf course, to get my project using subversion is no problem. The thing is that the projects have TFS bindings in them. How can I remove these Would be nice with a step by step guide. p  pemAnd so you dont have to wonder what tools I have I can connect to the projects with both the TFS Explorer thing in Visual Studio and with TortoiseSVN. I also have TFS power tools installed, so I can use those too if needed.emp

To do this, Id implement code[ContainerView layoutSubviews]code which would iterate through the codeModuleViewscode, call code[ModuleView sizeToFit]code on each one, and then position them relative to one another according to the desired layout.p  pMy question is to do with the best way of implementing code[ModuleView sizeThatFits]code and code[ModuleView layoutSubviews]code to minimise repetition and to allow codeModuleViewscode to change size while maintaining the layout correctly.p  pTake the simplest case where codeModuleViewcode is a codeUIViewcode with a multiline codeUILabelcode subview, and padding on either side.

This works, but quickly becomes a mess when the views are more complicated.p  pIs there a way to simplify this I havent been able to find good examples of how others approach this problem.p

Negative 1449 pI have a page being loaded in an codeltiframegtcode.p  pInside the codeltiframegtcode, I have a function that patiently waits for the page to load using jQuerys codewindow.loadcode event which is supposed to wait until strongALLstrong page content images, javascript, css, etc. is loaded before firing.p  pThe function then calls back to the page loading the codeltiframegtcode using codepostMessagecode to send the height of the content in the codeltiframegtcode back.p  pI have tested the functionality in IE7, IE8, Firefox 2, Firefox 3, Opera, and Chrome and everything works fine.

Negative 1449 pIm currently working on a project Euler problem www.projecteuler.net for fun but have hit a stumbling block.  One of the problem provides a 20x20 grid of numbers and asks for the greatest product of 4 numbers on a straight line.  This line can be either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.  p  pUsing a procedural language Id have no problem solving this, but part of my motivation for doing these problems in the first place is to gain more experience and learn more Haskell.br As of right now Im reading in the grid and converting it to a list of list of ints, eg  [[Int]].  This makes the horizontal multiplication trivial, and by transposing this grid the vertical also becomes trivial.  p  pThe diagonal is what is giving me trouble.  Ive thought of a few ways where I could use explicit array slicing or indexing, to get a solution, but it seems overly complicated and hackey.  I believe there is probably an elegant, functional solution here, and Id love to hear what others can come up with.p

Negative 1449 pIm connecting to a Jet 4 DB through ODBC.  The Jet DB uses passthrough queries to an Oracle DB. This works so far cant access the pt queries directly, but creating a view on the query does the trick.p  pI need some subset of the data returned by the pts. Parameters would be best, but are not supported.p  pTwo questionsp  p1 Jet does seem to be able to push some whereclauses to Oracle. Eg I have a passthrough query that returns 100k rows. A view on the pt with a single flitering clause eg district  1010 is very fast, so the processing seems to happen on Oracle. Adding more clauses can slow the query down to a crawl, looping for minutes with high CPU utilization. Is there any documentation on what is passed on and what is done on in the Jet sidep  p2 There are lots of tutorials on how to create dynamic passthrough queries with VBAAccess. Is it possible to do this or anything to that effect with Jet accessed through ODBCp  pThanks Martinp  pstrongEditstrong Sorry for being so unclear. p  pI have a reporting tool that accesses a Jet db through ODBC. The Jet db contains some data and several passthrough queries to an Oracle db. A typical use case would be a generating report for a given department and a given date, using data from Jet and Oracle. This works very well in principle.p  pThe problem is that passthrough queries cannot contain any parameters. A passthrough query works like a view, so I can simply execute select  from ptquery where dep  a and date  somedate. Jet, however, loads all rows from the pt and does a full scan on the client side. This is unusably slow for a 100krows view and I need to find a way to avoid that. p  pFor emsomeem simple selects, Jet does seem to let Oracle do the hard work and does not load all rows, hence my question 1.p  pIf that doesnt work, I need to find a way to force Jet to load only the data I need from Oracle for a given request. p  pI know that I can modify pts through Access VBA, but I only connect through ODBC, so I can only pass SQL to Jet, not call the vb api unless its possible to inline VB in the SQL statement. p

Negative 1449 pIm building a photo book layout application. The application frequently decompresses JPEG images into inmemory bitmap buffers. The size of the images is constrained to 100 megapixels while they usually do not exceed 15 megapixels.p  pSometimes memory allocations for these buffers fail code[[NSMutableData alloc] initWithLength]code returns codenilcode. This seems to happen in situations where the systemss free physical memory approaches zero.p  pMy understanding of the a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationPerformanceConceptualManagingMemoryArticlesAboutMemory.html23applerefdocuid20001880BCICIHABvirtual memory system in Mac OS Xa was that an allocation in a 64 bit process emvirtuallyem sic cant fail. There are 16 exabyte of address space of which Im trying to allocate a maximum of 400 megabytes at a time. Theoretically I could allocate 40 billion of these buffers without hitting the hard limit of the available address space. Of course practical limits would prevent this scenario as swap space is constrained by the boot volumes size. In reality Im only making very few of these allocations less than ten.p  pWhat I do not understand is the fact that an allocation fails, no matter how low physical memory is at that point. I thought thatas long as theres swap space leftmemory allocation would not fail as the pages are not even mapped at this point.p  pThe application is garbage collected.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pI had time to dig into this problem a little further and here are my findingsp  ol liThe problem only occurs in a garbage collected process.li liWhen the allocation from codeNSMutableDatacode fails, a plain codemalloccode still succeeds to allocate the same amount of memory.li liThe error always happens when overall physical memory approaches zero swapping is about to take place.li ol  pI assume codeNSDatacode uses codeNSAllocateCollectablecode to perform the allocation instead of codemalloccode when running under garbage collection.p  pMy conclusion from all that is that the collector is unable to allocate big chunks of memory when physical memory is low. Which again, I dont understand.p

Negative 1449 pI am reading in arbitrary size file in blocks of 1021 bytes, with a block size of lt 1021 bytes for the final block of the file.

Negative 1449 pSay I want to write an interface exposing the set of books a user has read. Since I want URIs to be humanreadable, theyll be of the form codebooksWarandPeacecode. Adding a book to the set seems like a PUT operation, as it 1 creates a new resource, and 2 is idempotent, since a set cannot have duplicate elements. However, the PUT method requires the client to know the URI of the resource to be created, which must be calculated on the server in this case, since there may be multiple books with the same title, which would be represented as codebooksWarandPeacecode and codebooksWarandPeace2code. A hacky solution, of course, is to use POST, which is allowed to create new resources, but is not guaranteed to be idempotent.p  pMy solution is the followingp  ol liThe client PUTs to codebookhasheslthashgtcode, where codelthashgtcode is a hash of the book object.li liThe server creates a reference to the object at both that URI and codebookslttitlegtcode.li liThe server issues a 303 See Other status code pointing to codebookslthashgtcode.li liThe client GETs codebookhasheslthashgtcode.li liThe server responds with a 301 Moved Permanently, pointing to codebookslttitlegtcode.li liThe client GETs codebookslttitlegtcode and stores it as the new URI for the book resource.li liThe server deletes codebookhasheslthashgtcode.li ol  pIs this a legitimate REST solution Has anyone solved the problem a different wayp
Negative 1449 pFor all the things I love about Grails I do have one small issue and this isnt really even a Grails specific problem.  GSP changes require redeployments of the entire web application.

Negative 1449 pThe a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryff47690528vvs.8529.aspxmsdn documentationa explains that in directx 11 there are multiple ways to fill a directx 11 texture programmaticallyp  p1 Create the texture with default usage texture and initialize it with data from memoryp  p2 Create the texture with dynamic usage, use DeviceContext Map to get a pointer to texture memory, write to it, then use Unmap to indicate you are done at which point I guess it is copied to the gpup  p3 Create the texture with staging usage and follow same steps as for dynamic texture, but follow that with a call to ID3D11DeviceContext.CopyResource to use this staging texture to in turn fill a non immutable default or dynamic texture.p  pHowever the documentation doesnt explain pros and cons of each method at all, and I am still quite new to directx, so it is not at all clear to me. p  pWhat are the pros and cons of each of these ways of creating a texture programmatically in directx 11p  pstrongSide notestrong I have read that in the context of staging textures, emreadingem back from the gpu isnt buffered so you have to do your own double buffering. But I dont know whether this was accurate and whether it applies to writing using staging textures or even really what it means.p  pstrongSecond side notestrong The Map method documentation says it gets a pointer to data in a subresource and denies the GPU access to that subresource. When the GPU wants to access a texture whose underlying data has been called by Map, what does it do Stall I ask because this sounds like part of the pros and cons I inquired aboutp

Negative 1449 pIm not too sure whether this is doable or not.p  pCurrently I need to set the license information before the start of my test code, because these tests use a third party component library that requires me to initialize the license information. The license information needs to be set only once at the start of the running of the program.p  pBut from what I understand, the philosophy of NUnit is that you can run a class, any class at any time, in any sequence, so although there is a codesetupcode method for each class, there isnt a codesetupcode method that runs at the start of the test for a test suite. But I may be wrong.p  pIs there anyway to make sure that a method is always the first being called during the whole test execution processp

Negative 1449 pIs it possible to concatenate the results of Regex Pattern Matching using only Regex syntaxp  pThe specific instance is a program is allowing regex syntax to pull info from a file, but I would like it to pull from several portions and concatenate the results.p  pFor instancep  pInput string 1234567890p  pDesired result string 2389p  pRegex Pattern match lt1.4strongememstronglt7.0p  pWhere strongememstrong represents some form of concatenation syntax.  Using starting and ending with syntax is important since I know the field names but not the values of the field.p  pDoes a keyword that functions like strongememstrong exist  Is there a more clever way to do this  Must the code be changed to allow multiple regex inputs, automatically concatenating  p  pAgain, the pieces to be concatenated may be far apart with unknown characters in between.  All that is known is the information surrounding the substrings.p  p20110808 edit The program is written in C, but changing the code is a major undertaking compared to finding a regexbased solution.p

Negative 1449 pI want to read a .config file. Before I read the file I need to make sure whether the file is in the folder or not.  At the moment i am using a System.Configuration.AppSettingsReader to read the configuration file it only reads when the file is in the folder as soon as i moved the file in different folder i throws me a error. But i dont know how to check whether there is a .config file in a folder or not. What i want to do is if the .config is in the folder get reader.getvalue and perform some action and if the .config file is not in the folder do something else. Is ther any way of checking just the extension of the particular file in C p  pthanksp

Negative 1449 pSo Im trying to make a gui for a guitar effects program. One goal is to allow others to design svg skins to customize the look. I made widgets that inherited each widget i.e. qdial and in the initializer load the svg file specified by the skin into a qGraphicsSvgItem. This is put into a scene and a view and I overloaded the resize and repaint appropriately. This works.p  pWhen I load several of these custom svg widgets 5 dials, a button, and an led into a parent widget the cpu rails and my program freezes. Am I going about this entirely the wrong way Should I even be using QT It seemed easier than trying to do everything with a stylesheet especially I couldnt figure out how to change the dial appearance. Would it improve things to leave the widgets as qGraphicsSvgItems and put them all into the parent widgets scene and viewp  pThis is meant to be a real time signal processing program so I dont want to burn up a lot of cpu in the GUI. I tried to do some research on it but couldnt find a lot for svg. I also dont see any performance checker in qtCreator or Id try to see what the bottleneck is. Anyway Id really appreciate any advice you could offer before I spend more time trying to do something the wrong way.p  pThanks so much ssj71p  pp.s.

As you can see I have layers of QGraphicsViews each with one widget. I suspect now this might be the worst way to do it so I wonder if anyone has more experience before I move forward in a bad direction. Also after playing some more with it, the problem seems to occur when I have 2 instances of the qSVGDial. If I load other combinations of widgets it works alright. Thanks again everyonep

Negative 1449 pConsider the following imagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfdnXH.png altenter image description herep  pMy app first finds all the blue pixels and also records the x,y coordinates of all their siblings the siblings for a given pixel are those that border it up, down, left, right, upperleft, upperright, etc. It then loops through all of these blue pixels in order to figure out how many blue siblings they have. The goal is ultimately to determine which group of blue pixels is the biggest.p  pThis is a large loop, though, and it ends up resulting in the error warning Unable to restore previously selected frame. I believe this occurs because Im overflowing the stack. If that is the case, how would you recommend I change my code in order to fix this issuep  pHeres the codep  pThe method that starts the loopingp  precodefor NSString key in pixelItemDict      Pixel px  [pixelItemDict objectForKeykey]     if px.hasBeenCounted           If it hasnt been counted, we know that were onto a new distinct area, because otherwise counterForSiblingsOfPixel would have already counted it. So we now add a copy of the pixelsCurrentlyBeingCounted array, empty that array, and reset the counter         [pixelCounterDict setObject[pixelsCurrentlyBeingCounted copy] forKey[NSString stringWithFormati,currentPxCounter]]          [pixelsCurrentlyBeingCounted removeAllObjects]          [self counterForSiblingsOfPixelpx]        codepre  pThe method that continuously calls itself, resulting in the stack overflowp  precode voidcounterForSiblingsOfPixelPixel px      [pixelsCurrentlyBeingCounted addObjectpx]     currentPxCounter     px.hasBeenCounted  true      for Pixel sibling in px.siblings          if sibling.hasBeenCounted [self counterForSiblingsOfPixelpx]       codepre  pEssentially, I have a codepixelItemDictcode that contains all the blue pixels. I enumerate over this dictionary, calling the method codecounterForSiblingsOfPixelcode on each one. That method in turn calls itself on each one of the siblings of the pixel passed to it. The codeforincode loop only regains control once every pixel in an area of blue has been counted. Therefore, large areas of blue result in codecounterForSiblingsOfPixelcode calling itself a huge number of times, leading to the overflow.p  pIs there a standard design pattern that should be used in cases such as thisp

Negative 1449 pThis is a bit of a tough question to ask without making it too general or broad, so I apologize in advance if its too high level for this question amp answer format. p  pI am working on a system that includes an oftenupdated feed type system a la twitter style, and a system that ranks items based on user votes. The system is based on a jsonrestful api written in PHP that accesses a mostly innodb mysql database. The database itself is actually quite highly optimized itself, and well normalized. The system also utilizes sphinx for searches, and some external queue amp processing systems for data processing. p  pMy question is does anyone have any suggestions for ways to implement memcache in a system where so much is reliant on database table relationshipsp  pFor example the hot list is based on a rank that is calculated every time someone votes on an item. Someone votes, a new rank is calculated for the item, and stored in the mysql database as an integer. p  pWould it be more efficient to write something like a cron job to cache this list of entries every few minutes, and thus hit the db less frequently  or  would it make sense to pull an id from the DB, and instead of caching the list, cache the item data and pull the data individually from memory for each item in the list p  pThe curveball is that for each item, the api call also needs to return whether or not the user has voted on the item or not, which could also be cached, but its hard to cache something thats existence needs to be checked for. p  pIm finding it to be a bit of mental gymnastics trying to determine what data it actually makes sense or is possible to cache when so much is reliant on data that is updated so heavily. p  pEither way, not sure if this is even the right question to be asking, but I would LOVE some insight from anyone who has a lot of experience dealing with caching for applications that have very few static elements. p  hr  pAs an aside, I have seriously considered looking into using Redis to manage the ranked item feed... ie, instead of hitting the database when the rank updates, instead just updating the redis list. Ive only spent a little bit of time working with redis though, so im not 100 that it is the best way to deal with this on system that needs to be super scalable. p

Negative 1449 pLets say that I have 4 commit on my GitHub, and I already sent a pull request to another collaborator. But on those 4 commit, there is 1 commit, I dont wish my collaborator accept that file. How can we do that As far as I try, there is only a button which show automatically merge if there is no conflict, and we cant choose which commit we want to accept.p  pSecond is, I have 1 commit which already exist on my Github, and I dont send any pull request  to another collaborator in this case, there are pending pull request which have not been pull by another collaborator. But once the collaborator pull the files, the commit which I didnt send will be included automatically. So I dont see that pull request is useful here. while we  still can get all the updated data without sending a pull request.p  pSo my main question is, is there any other way to choose which commit we want another collaborator to accept Because sometimes, I dont want my collaborator accept the commitfiles first. p

Negative 1449 pI have a report that is suppose to compare Quotes to Orders.  p  pIt currently has a simple hierarchy YearMonthSuccessfulQuotes and then a column to the right that has the Count of Successful Quotes. p  pId like to just add another column directly to the right of it, that contains a measure for the Count of All Quotes.  Is this possible  p  pI have been attempting to understand the logic of SSAS for several months now, and have the impression that reports typically are hierachical in nature, and that since Successful Quotes is in the hierarchy, then I cannot display the total unless I change the structure of the hierarchy.p  pManagers do not care whether a report is hierarchical or not.  They just want a column added to the right, which I could do if this were a programming language.  Isnt SSAS restrictive in this sensep

Negative 1449 pI am am trying to construct a database in SQL Server 2008 R2 that will allow users to place their own subtypes into categories. I have a parent table that holds the preset category names defined by me.  p  pThe question I face is what is what is the best way to deal with the codePRIMARY KEYcode and codeUNIQUEcode constraint, and foreign key REFERENCES. Indexing is at the center of this as I anticipate that the sub table we will call it codeCategoryTypescode will grow quite large over time and will need to be able to efficiently allow reads from the data based on the parent table codeCategoriescode. Is there any problem I would need to anticipate if the tables were laid out as follows  p  pMy concern is that the codeIDENTITYcode column in the codeCategoryTypescode table will need to maintain a unique count. The reason I have included this field is to allow a simpler reference when passing data between tiers in the application. By passing an Integer versus an Integer  String pair. The data in these tables will persist at each layer of the database to save on bandwidth. From a database perspective, does the layout below pose any major challenges once deployedp  pTo simplify, is there a problem with using a unique ID field codeIDENTITYcode that is not included in the primary key when a composite key is present See table layout belowp  pParent Tablep  precodeCREATE TABLE schema.Categories    Id TINYINT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,   Name VARCHAR100 NOT NULL,  codepre  pSub Table User inserted data over timep  precodeCREATE TABLE schema.CategoryTypes     Id INT IDENTITY1,1 NOT NULL,    CategoryId TINYINT REFERENCES schema.CategoriesId NOT NULL,    Name VARCHAR100 NOT NULL,    CONSTRAINT PRIMARY KEY CLUSTEREDCategoryId, Name    CONSTRAINT UCCategoryTypesId UNIQUE NONCLUSTEREDId  codepre

The zip files I create are named TxtFileBkupyyyymmddhhMMss.zip and FldrBkupyyyymmddhhMMss.zip. p  pI build the list of items to back up by extension as followsp  precodeextArray  .txt,.asc foreach ea in extArray      filelist  GetChildItem ToBeZipped Recurse Include ea SelectObject fullname   foreach fn in fileList      fileName  fn.FullName     create7zip filename zipFolderDataFileOut      codepre  pThe folder is then backed up separately in an additional step.p  pLater on, I set the attribute byte of all files in the backup folder, then count the number of files in the folder matching a certain pattern, and if its over 5, I unset the attribute byte that is checked and deleted in the next run.    p  precodedelfiles0  delfiles dir zipFolderTargetBackup.zip.count5  if delfiles gt 0    If there are more than 5 zipped backups, well turn off the archive bit on them dir zipFolderTargetBackup  sortobject property .CreationTime  selectobject first delfiles  foreachobject  attrib .FULLNAME A  codepre  pWhat I would like to do is to store the generic backup names TxtFileBkup, FldrBkup in an array along with a number of backups I would want of them, and then use that array amp nbr of backups to determine and mark backups to be deleted the next time the script runs. A bonus would be if I could use that array with or without the array of file extensions amp the folder backup so it would be 1 step to create both sets of backups.  p
Negative 1449 pIs it so that svcutil tool is recommended over xsd tool I didnt see that as a confirmed statement, but it did seem so. The reason that I am confused over this is that I generated a class using both the tools. But, I got a better class using xsd. The XSD schema consists of DataContracts only.p  pI used the following command for svcutilp  precodesvcutil pathtoxyz.xsd languageC dataContractOnly importxmltypes outpathtoclass.cs codepre  pThis generated the desired classes. But, it contained only XmlNode[] objects for the fields.p  pThen, I used the following command for xsdp  precodexsd.exe c pathtoxyz.xsd outpathtoclass.cs codepre  pIt generated much better classes than svcutil did. Most of the fields were converted as desired.p  pShould I have any reason to believe that I should use svcutil over xsd thenp
Negative 1449 pIn Android, codeandroid.database.sqlite.SQLiteStatementcode allows me to use prepared statements in SQLite to avoid injection attacks.

Negative 1449 pEDIT  Ive found an answer with help from Tejs see below.p  hr  pIm developing a Metro app using HTMLJavascript, along with some Cbased helper libraries.  Generally speaking Im having a lot of success calling C methods from Javascript, but I cant seem to get passing arrays in my specific case, arrays of strings to work.  Passing individual strings works without issue.p  pMy code is something like thisp  precode in javascript project var string1  ... var string2  ... var string3  ... var result  MyLibrary.MyNamespace.MyClass.foo[string1, string2, string3] codepre  pThen, in Cp  precode in C project public sealed class MyClass      public static string Foostring[] strings           do stuff...       codepre  pThe problem is that the method Foo gets an array with the correct length so in the above example, 3, but all of the elements are empty.  I also tried thisp  precodepublic static string Fooobject[] strings  ... codepre  pThat didnt work either  again, the array was the correct size, but all the elements were null.p  pIve tried passing string literals, string variables, using new Array... in javascript, changing the signature of Foo to params string[] and params object[], all to no avail.p  pSince passing individual strings works fine, I can probably work around this with some hackery...but it really seems like this should work.  It seems really odd to me that the array is passed in as the right size i.e. whatevers doing the marshaling knows SOMETHING about the javascript array structure and yet the contents arent getting populated.p

Negative 1449 pIm trying to embed PS in my .NET app to make part of object model easily discoverable and have the ability to navigate it. It is easy to create runspace, prompt user for some script as plain string, run the script in the runspace and output something to the user. But in that way it lacks interactivity  user doesnt get autocompletion, IntelliSense, tooltips etc, thus he is required to issue codeGetMemberscode constantly just to know what he can do with given objects.p  pAs I understand interactivity is provided by codePSHostcode thing. Is it possible to go without implementing it manually in the application, but rather expose embedded runspace somehow, so I can connect to it with PowerGUI for example codeEnterPSSessioncode or something alike.p

Negative 1449 pI have an open source WPF application hosted on GitHub a hrefhttpsgithub.comtomhunterghSourceLog relnofollowhttpsgithub.comtomhunterghSourceLogap  pWhat I was hoping to do was add ClickOnce deployment and host the ClickOnce install on AppHarbor so that users are automatically upgraded when I push new commits to GitHub.  What Im looking for is an auto update feature similar to the GitHub Windows client, and Im also hoping to find somewhere to host the ClickOnce install bits for free.p  pI have a number of questionsp  ul liHow does AppHarbor actually work  As far as I can tell it expects a Visual Studio solution containing a single web application project, which it then builds and deploys.  What specifically does it look for to run, what assumptions is it making  What happens when you have non web projects, or your solution isnt in the root directory for example  li liIs there any way to customise the build and deployment process, for example with custom MSBuild scriptsli liHow would I ensure the WPF project is published so that the ClickOnce bits are generatedli liIs there any way to get a build number from the AppHarbor build process  E.g. a four part assembly version 1.2.3.4 and write that to the generated binariesconfigli liIs there any way for AppHarbor to push the ClickOnce bits back to GitHub after a successful build, so that I could instead host the ClickOnce install on GitHubli ul  pShould I be taking a completely different approachp

Negative 1449 pWere using MSMQ to insert records from a service into SQL Server tables in multiple locations.

Negative 1449 pI have a website that is essentially four divs  each of which is set to the height of the window so that the total document is four times the height of the window.p  pThe idea is that a click on a div advances the scroll by one window height  which works fine, like thisp  precode on click event  ifcurframeltnumberslides    scrolling  true    html,body.animatescrollTopwindowheightcurframe,function       scrollingfalse      codepre  pAfter the user scrolls the page manually, however, Id like to snap the position to the nearest multiple of the window height  so a given div is once again centered on the screen.

Negative 1449 pIm using the SQL server 2008.p  pThe scenario is We have about two hundred reports to generate daily, and it need plenty of time to query in DB and refine the data.

Could u pls give me some ideas on it If not, we have to write a new program to do it..but it needs effort..p
Negative 1449 pId like to be able to generate and load custom classes within an unsigned applet. Generating them I can deal with, but Im battling with the applet SecurityManager that doesnt seem to want me to load them.p  pHeres a visual overview as you can see Im stuck on Phase 2p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4WGPr.png altunderpants gnomesp  pWhat I originally intended was to use a custom class loader. Apparently this isnt allowed in an applet the ClassLoader constructor throws a SecurityException.p  pThen I considered calling a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavalangClassLoader.htmldefineClass28java.lang.String,20byte5b5d,20int,20int29 relnofollowClassLoader.defineClassString name, byte[] b, int off, int lena on another class loader directly, but that method is protected.p  pI tried to make the method accessible via reflection. My hopes there werent high but I tried it and indeed that too threw a SecurityException.p  pa hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavanetURLClassLoader.html relnofollowURLClassLoadera appeared to offer salvation it has a static factory creation method which does not throw any security exception. However, that technique doesnt permit subclassing the loader or access to the protected defineClass method. It only accepts an array of URL objects.p  pSo I tried to subclass a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavanetURL.html relnofollowURLa to override its openConnection method to return my class bytes that way, but the URL class is final.p  pThen I tried creating a custom a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavanetURLStreamHandler.html relnofollowURLStreamHandlera with an overridden openConnection method and passing it to the constructor of a URL. The SecurityManager threw another fit over this.p  pSo then I tried calling URL.setStreamHandlerFactory with a custom factory that would return my custom stream handler. There was the SecurityManager again, complaining, because what else is it good for if not complainingp  pSo then I tried creating a a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavaxmanagementloadingMLet.html relnofollowjavax.management.loading.MLeta. I have no clue what its for but its a subclass of URLClassLoader that allows specifying a custom URLStreamHandlerFactory in its constructor and doesnt mention throwing a security exception, but it still did anyway.p  pIn desperation I tried calling a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavanetProxySelector.html relnofollowProxySelectora.setDefault with a custom ProxySelector, hoping to incercept a URL and somehow route it back into my applet, but I dont have permission for that either.p  pI tried setting the codejava.system.class.loadercode property via a codeltparam namejavaarguments ...gtcode tag, but it didnt seem to be one of the honored properties.p  pstrikeFinally, the only remaining way I can think of to do this is to send my class bytes up to a remote server that will generate a temporary URL that I can use in conjunction with URLClassLoader.newInstanceURL[]. That would work but I really dont like the idea. It seems like it could get complicated fast, with the interaction of the different ClassLoaders, and the serverdependence is not really practical for what I want to do.strike emApparently the SecurityManager is only too happy to let you create a URLClassLoader, but gets spontaneously upset when you try to use it.emp  pI emwouldem like to do this from within the normal unsigned applet security sandbox if its at all possible, so that the experience is seamless.p  pBut mostly Im just baffled, because if its not possible it makes no sense. strikeIf the SecurityManager is happy about loading classes from arbitrary external URLs it shouldnt mind loading one from a byte array in a local variable.strike emThe restriction is still nonsensical. The code is still internal and sandboxed.emp  pIts useful both for dynamic code generation and for implementing custom JAR compression, like LZMA compression.p  pHelpp
Negative 1449 pIm looking for the functionality of a BlockingQueue that queues to disk instead of memory. Id rather avoid a heavyweight solution e.g. JMS. Ideally the queue should run in the same process as the client producer and consumer, on the JVM. It should be able to continue queuing if the consumer is stopped, and also survive restarts.p

Negative 1449 pI am using a BIGINT to hold an id number that will increment from 1.  In one table this will be the Primary Key and will, of course, be unique in other tables it will be a foreign key.  Im trying to figure out whether this key will be packed if I set PACKKEYS, since there will be a lot of leading zeroes.p  pIm having difficulty understanding the MySQL doc for the PACKKEYS table option in a hrefhttpdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.5encreatetable.html relnofollowtable creationa.  Here is the relevant quote from the docp  blockquote   pWhen packing binary number keys, MySQL uses prefix compressionp      ul   lipEvery key needs one extra byte to indicate how many bytes of the   previous key are the same for the next key.pli   lipThe pointer to the row is stored in highbytefirst order directly   after the key, to improve compression.pli   ul      pThis means that if you have strongemmany equal keys on two consecutive rows,   all following same keys usually only take two bytes including the   pointer to the rowemstrong. Compare this to the ordinary case where the   following keys takes storagesizeforkey  pointersize where the   pointer size is usually 4. Conversely, you get a significant benefit   from prefix compression only if you have many numbers that are the   same. If all keys are totally different, you use one byte more per   key, if the key is not a key that can have NULL values. In this case,   the packed key length is stored in the same byte that is used to mark   if a key is NULL.p blockquote  pTheyve lost me with strongemmany equal keys on two consecutive rows, all following same keys usually only take two bytes including the pointer to the rowemstrong.  Can someone interpret the above doc for me, in light of what Im trying to accomplish  E.g., for a primary key there wont be ANY equal keys  on two consecutive rows, on three consecutive rows, on 100 nonconsecutive rows... or whatever theyre driving at.p  pThanksp

Negative 1449 pOkay, so Im relatively naive in my knowledge of the PHP VM and Ive been wondering about something lately. In particular, what the request lifecycle looks like in PHP for a web application. I found an article a hrefhttpphp.findinfo.ruphp016ch20lev1sec5.html relnofollowherea that gives a good explanation, but I feel that there stronghasstrong to be more to the story.p  pFrom what the article explains, the script is parsed and executed each time a request is made to the server This just seems crazy to me p  pIm trying to learn PHP by writing a little microframework that takes advantage of many PHP 5.35.4 features. As such, I got to thinking about what strongstaticstrong means and how long a static classvariable actually lives. I was hoping that my application could have a emsetupem phase which was able to cache its results into a class with emstaticem properties. However, if the entire script is parsed and executed on each request, I fail to see how I can avoid running the application initialization steps for every request serveredp  pI just really hope that I am missing something important here... Any insight is greatly apreciatedp

Negative 1449 pI am developing an app for the iPhone and am encountering some memory management issues. During execution of the app the live bytes continuously increase without bound. I have tried to track down the issue within my code but cannot seem to find anything that would cause the live bytes to increase so dramatically. The one thing that I have noticed during execution is that the allocation for CFStringImmutable increase the most rapidly and never decrease or stay constant. Does anyone have any idea why this may be happening All that the app is doing during this execution is populating a table view from a local array or strings, then downloading another array of string objects and populating a different table view.

I dont want to go any where near the CLRp  pThe context is I write dllsxlls for Excel, since Excel 12 Microsoft have claimed these functions can be multithreaded, I want to investigate how this works.p  pIve been off Stack Exchange for a year or two, so please be gentle.  Ive had a bit of a hunt around most of the stuff Ive found focuses on the theorectical rather than the implementationp

Negative 1449 pA Java project Ive been working on integrates with several RDBMSs.

Its difficult to pull all the functionality into the superclass without the superclass essentially being aware of every place that something could be different, defeating the encapsulation subclassing is meant to buy us.p  pOne method weve considered is representing the DBs by features that they share, such as supports feature X and cant do feature Y, however its not altogether clear that the code would end up being more maintainable that way becausep  ol liMany of the quirks only apply to one DB.li liWe cant think of enough sharedcomparable basically, abstractable features to make this worthwhile.li ol  pDoes anyone have other suggestions of ways we could reduce the code duplication between the subclasses, perhaps using a design patternp

Negative 1449 pIs preprocessing static resources through middleware using express a good idea for production environments From my understanding the middleware stack is run, in series, for every request. Wouldnt that mean then that preprocessing middle would regenerate a static resource ie somestyles.less  somestyles.css after every request If so, would it be better to simply preprocess through a build system such as grunt.js in advance and serve those files Id like the final rendering of the css and js to be concatenated to one file and minified.p  pAlso, is it worthwhile to prerender html from templates such as jade on pages with only static content Or is that more trouble than its worthp

However when using the DLL on two different versions of g the nonstandard ABI created the standard c problems with DLL calling.

Negative 1449 pIve searched everywhere on this and cant find anyone doing anything similar. Im quite a newbie at C having worked 15 years with a nonobject orientated language, so I hope Im not missing something simple.p  pI am trying to make a standard Winform which gets inherited, so that I dont need to repeat the code I use every time one of the joys of .Net over what Ive used for years is the ability to centralize things far more.p  pMy problem comes that I want to implement the ability to either call the derived classes as single instance or multiple instance when launched from the MDI and after much much searching Ive almost achieved this using generics. But Ive got stuck with how to know which class the current form is, to pass that to the generic class to close the form.p  pA simplified version of my code will help understand my problem. This is my generic class designed for launching and closing the form. It determines if the Instance for T already exists, depending on if you are launching a single or multiple instance it either shows that, or creates a new instance of the form. The MDI for is passed in the launch methods to allow me to attach the new form to that.p  precodepublic class FormLaunchltTgt where T  MyBaseForm, new      public static T Instance     public static void LaunchultipleInstnaceFRMMDI mdi              Instance  new T         Instance.MdiParent  mdi         Instance.Show         Instance.BringToFront          public static void LaunchSingleInstanceFRMMDI mdi              if Instance  null Instance  new T         Instance.MdiParent  mdi         Instance.Show         Instance.BringToFront          public static void CloseInstance              Instance  null       codepre  pA Single Instance version of the form is launched from the MDI using the following statement.p  precode        FormLaunchltMyDerivedClassgt.LaunchSingleInstancethis codepre  pThe problem comes that I would like to handle the closing of the form once in my base form and not have to do it every time in the derived forms. But I cant work out how to do this.p  precodepublic partial class MyBaseForm  Form      public MyBaseForm              InitializeComponent          private void MyBaseFormFormClosedobject sender, FormClosedEventArgs e              FormLaunchltthis.GetTypegt.CloseInstance       codepre  pBut this.GetType does not work. If I was just using this form directly rather than inheriting it I could just use p  precode        FormLaunchltMyBaseFormgt.CloseInstance codepre  pOr if I handled the FormClosed event in every derived class then I could just usep  precode        FormLaunchltMyDerivedClassgt.CloseInstance codepre  pBut I really want to do this in a way that stops me forgetting to do this every time in the derived class... because I wrote this a few months ago and have already forgotten pretty much every time Ive used it.p  pEDIT My question is really, what do I pass in the place of T inp  precode        FormLaunchltTgt.CloseInstance codepre  pThis needs to refer to the derived class and I cant seem to find that. this.GetType refers to the correct glass but does not work.p

Negative 1449 pWe have an issue where our user control is initialized based on what the user sets in XAML when utilizing our control.  Currently we were using the Loaded event to act on what the user had set or not.p  pHowever, the issue with using the Loaded event is another sibling of this control is using emtheirem loaded event to set something on ours, which isnt yet fully initialized since emourem Loaded event hasnt yet fired.  Its a UI race condition if you will.p  pAgain, we cant move our code to the constructor as the WPF system hasnt yet set the properties specified by the XAML of the consumer of our control.  We cant use the Loaded event for the reasons stated above.  Initialized doesnt seem to work either.p  pIve also looked into ISupportsInitialize, but thats where emweem would be batchsetting the controls properties, not something externally, so that doesnt seem to be a fit either.p  pThoughtsp  h2Updateh2  pIve since found out this is an anomaly specifically with UserControls.

Negative 1449 pI am building a mobile app for my web application. I have decided to use a hrefhttpcordova.apache.org relnofollowcordovaa , So basically it will be single page web app. I have also made a REST API server which uses key and secret to verify each request. In web app I can use key and secret to make request to my api server, But how do I do it with in mobile app It would be bad idea to store key and secret in mobile app May be it is bad idea for web app aswell. I am thinking of changing Authentication process in api server aswell. What sould be the best way to call this rest api server from mobile app and authenticate these requests. Should I generate tokens for each user request and verify with key and secret I think i will not need oauth as this service will be for my webapp and mobile apps only, we dont have need to allow others third party service to access our api.p

Negative 1449 pIm tackling a sorting problem that involves sorting a file that is larger than main memory.  The first phase generates an intermediate file whose size is the identical to the original input file but that contains some number of locally sorted subsections.p  pThe second phase merges these subsections back into a single sorted list.p  pInstead of creating a third file to contain the single sorted list I would like to overwrite the intermediate file that Im reading from emas Im reading from item.p  pAdditionally, Id like to maintain separate read buffers for each input stream each of which is reading from some offset into the intermediate file.p  pI know I can use fopen and fseek to create multiple buffered readonly input streams.  However, the contract for fopen stipulates that calling it on a file in w mode sets the files size to zero if it already exists.  I need it to not alter the files size since Im still reading from it in multiple places.p  pIs there a straightforward way to accomplish this using fopen amp fseek  Or am I going to need to use open and manage my own readwrite bufferingp

I can use something like codeforfiles d 07102013 c cmd c echo fnamecode to act on everything after 71013, but what I want is to just be able to calculate instead from 90 days before today.p  pIs there a syntax for the date calculation that will work in a cmd file that will let me specify x days before today to feed into FORFILESp  pI prefer to not use VBS and found a code snippet that would work in VBS, though I could alternatively rewrite my script for Powershell, but ideally I want to stick with cmd.p  pTo clarify, 90 would find all files older than 90 days 90 would find all files newer than 90 days after today which is fundamentally useless, as files are rarely written with future dates, and 7302013 will find all files newer than 7302013.  I want that last time period, preferably able to take a numberofdays variable passed to the CMD file, that would say after x number of days before today, i.e. in the last x days.  So instead of using the hardcoded date as shown above, I want to be able to calculate that date within the cmd file.p

Negative 1449 pIs there a way to implement functionality so that a user can Right click a subsection of an Html page say a DIV or other container element so that that part can be saved as an imagepdf using javascriptp  pAlternatively ideally  can this be done on the server side in ASP.NETp  pThe use case for this is the followingp  pI have some complex web pages generated in asp.NET and using the javscript Flot library for the graphs.  I would like to reuse part of the html page to generate PDF reports or at least image snapshots which can easily be inserted into reports.  I have looked around and it seems there is a tool wkhmltopdf which converts the entire page to PDF, however there are 2 issuesp  ol liThis tool needs to be run separately, which is not friendly for end usersli liThe tool extracts everything on the page, e.g. menus headers , footers etc.li ol  pFor the second problem I could generate web pages without the headersfooters and menus, and then use the tool, but this does not solve problem 1.  Ideally I would like to generate the report weekly and automatically so the user only needs to download it.p  pFor this purpose what is really needed is some way to  store as pdf or image a DIV or other element referenced by id.  This way I would not need to write separate code to generate the reports.  I realize there will be a loss of quality converting html to PDF, but for our purposes, this is not that important.p

The problem occurs when Im translating a function, which calls multiple times a polymorphic method of an object, passing each time different argument types, like herep  ppseudocodep  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodeclass X     def method1a, b         a, b  return      def fx     print x.method11,2               call method1 using Ints    print x.method1hello, world  call method1 using Strings   def main     x  X  constructor    fx  codepre  ol lipWhat is the best way of generating equivalent Haskell code of the OO pseudocode Ive provided I want p  ul lito be able to translate nonmutable classes with methods which can have default arguments to Haskells code. preserving laziness, so I do not want to use ugly codeIORefscode and mimic mutable data structuresli listrongnotstrong to force the user to explicitly write any types, so I can use all available Haskell mechanisms to allow automatic type inference  like using a hrefhttpwww.haskell.orghaskellwikiTemplateHaskell relnofollowTemplate Haskella to automatically generate typeclass instances for given methods etc..li lito be able to generate such code with my compiler, without the need of implementing my own type inferencer or with my own type inferencer if there is no other solutionli lithe result code to produce fast binaries be nicely optimized while compiling. li ulli lipIf the proposed below workflow is the best possible one, how can we fix the proposed Haskell code, in such a way, that both codef conXcode and codef conYcode will work see belowpli ol  pstrongCurrent work statusstrongp  pThe pseudocode strongcanstrong be easily translated into following Haskell code it is handwritten, not generated, to be simpler to readp  precode LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses   LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances    class and its constructor definition data X a  X  methodx1  a  derivingShow conX  X  methodx1  a b gt a,b    There can be other classes with method1 class Fmethod1 cls sig where   method1  cls sig gt sig  instance Fmethod1 X a where   method1  methodx1  f x  do   print  method1 x 1Int 2Int   print  method1 x Hello  World  main  do   let x  conX   f x codepre  pThe above code does not work, because Haskell cannot infer implicit types of a hrefhttpwww.haskell.orghaskellwikiRankNtypes relnofollowranka higher than 1, like the type of codefcode. After a bit of discussion on haskell irc, a partial solution was found, namely we can translate the following pseudo codep  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodeclass X     def method1a, b         a, b  return       class Y     def method1a, b         a  return       def fx     printx.method11, 2    printx.method1hello, world   def main     x  X    y  Y    fx    fy  codepre  pto Haskell codep  precode LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses   LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances   LANGUAGE FunctionalDependencies   LANGUAGE RankNTypes   LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts    data Y a  Y  methody1  a  derivingShow data X a  X  methodx1  a  derivingShow  conX  X  methodx1  a b gt a,b  conY  Y  methody1  a b gt a   class Fmethod1 cls sig where   method1  cls sig gt sig  instance Fmethod1 X a where   method1  methodx1  instance Fmethod1 Y a where   method1  methody1  f  Fmethod1 m Int gt Int gt Int, Int,       Fmethod1 m String gt String gt String, String       gt forall a.

The line codef conYcode does not work. Additionally, is there any way to automatically generate the signature of codefcode or do I have to write my own type inferencer for thatp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThe solution provided by Crazy FIZRUK indeed works for this specific case, but using codeexistential data typescode, like codedata Printable  forall a. Show a gt Printable acode force all methods with a specific name ie. method1 to have the same result type across all possible classes, which is not what I want to achieve. p  pThe following example clearly shows what I meanp  ppseudocodep  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodeclass X     def method1a, b         a, b  return       class Y     def method1a, b         a  return       def fx     printx.method11, 2    x.method1hello, world  return   def main     x  X    y  Y    print fx.fst     fst returns first tuple emenet and is not defined for string    print fy.length  length returns length of String and is not defined for tuples  codepre  pIs it possible to translate such code to Haskell, allowing codefcode to return result of a specific type based on type of its argumentp

Negative 1449 pI have set up a few routing rules to make sure that a packet is sent over the same interface as the socket is bound to. The sendto function in C will try to choose the best possible interface based on the destination address. I am sending UDP packets to other devices both in and out of my local network, and in return they respond by sending UDP packets to the same address. Using strongWiresharkstrong I can verify that this happens. p  pBut although the packets arrive at the network stack, and can thus be read by Wireshark, they are not received by the socket bound to the specific interface.p  pThe routing rules on my Ubuntu system are the followingp  precodeiptables A OUTPUT o wlan0 t mangle p udp s 193.156.108.78 sport 12346 j MARK setmark 21 ip rule add fwmark 21 table 21 ip route add dev wlan0 default via 193.156.108.1 table 21 codepre  pI presume that I need to make changes to my strongiptablesstrong for incoming traffic, but I am unsure what is not working, since the the addresses on both the ethernet frame and the ip header seem to be correct.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pUsing the LOG target in iptables I have determined that the packets use the strongPREROUTINGstrong in the strongmanglestrong table, but not the strongPREROUTINGstrong in the strongnatstrong table.

Fortunately setting the strongrpfilterstrong variables to strong2strong in the same file solves the problem.p  pAs explained a hrefhttpwww.slashroot.inlinuxkernelrpfiltersettingsreversepathfiltering relnofollowherea packets will be blocked, if the interface on which they come in can not find a route to the source. Setting this strongrpfilterstrong value to 2 will solve my problem because it relies on the fact that my default interface can in fact route to this source. p  pstrongREMAINING QUESTIONSstrongp  pFor some reason setting this strongrpfilterstrong value to 0 does not always work It should drop no martian packets at all. Dont know why that is.p  pFurthermore I do not really like this solution and would gladly implement a better one if available. It seems to me that I need to find a way to give the wlan0 interface a standard way to route to this source, not just by marking packets. Suggestionsp

Negative 1449 pProbably my head is a kind of scrambled now, but Im having some difficulty understanding the description about the alreadydefined EventHandler delegate of .NET. The a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.eventhandler28vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowdocumentationa says it Represents the method that will handle an event that has no event data. Then if every time we use it well definitely not pass data, why the argument EventArgs is still there Its existence makes every time we have to pass an EventArgs.Empty to it which is quite tedious. Is there any particular reason for it, or is it just for compatibility and code flexibility Im new to .NET so sorry if this question seems naive. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 1449 pIm trying to use C to emulate something like dynamic typing. Im approaching the problem with inherited classes. For example, a function could be defined asp  precodeBaseClass myFunctionint what      if what  1          return new DerivedClass1      else if what  2          return new DerivedClass2       codepre  pThe base class and each derived class would have the same members, but of different types. For example, codeBaseClasscode may have codeint xyz  0code denoting nothing, codeDerivedClass1code might have codedouble xyz  123.456code, and codeDerivedClass2code might have codebool xyz  truecode. Then, I could create functions that returned one type but in reality returned several different types. The problem is, when ere I try to do this, I always access the base classs version of codexyzcode. Ive tried using pointers codevoidcode for the base, and correct ones for the derived classes, but then every time I want to access the member, I have to do something like codedoubleobjgtxyzcode which ends up being very messy and unreadable.p  pHeres an outline of my codep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  using stdcout using stdendl  class Foo  public     Foo       void member   class Bar  public Foo   public     Bar          member  new double123.456  Make member a double         int mainint argc, char args[]      Foo obj  new Bar      cout ltlt doubleobjgtmember      return 0  codepre  pI guess what Im trying to ask is, strongis this good coding practice If not, is there a different approach to functions that return multiple types or accept multiple typesstrongp

Negative 1449 pI have a view controller with a navigation bar at the top and a toolbar at the bottom with a table view in the center. The table view has a search bar and scope bar. The user can use the search, or not. When done searching the user select items from the resulting list and then selects a button in the toolbar to move to the next view controller using a segue. Everything is constructed using storyboards. The layout, functionality and workflow works fine under iOS 6.p  pUnder iOS 7 the layout, functionality, and workflow work fine wo search i.e., the user simply selects items from the table. The search mechanism also works fine, but the Done button in the navigation bar, and the Select button in the toolbar are disabled i.e., the prepareForSegue method isnt entered. If I select cancel in the search bar the search results are lost but the workflow is again functional i.e., the buttons are enabled and prepareForSegue is entered as expected.p  pI tried implementing the UISearchBar searchBarTextDidEndEditing and searchBarSearchButtonClicked methods and making sure they are invoked in the didSelectRowAtIndexPath method. These changes had no positive or negative effect. I also experimented with some of the features of the view controller, thinking that maybe the search results were in some way obscuring my navigation and toolbar buttons but that didnt work either.p  pI havent found a reference to anyone else encountering this kind of problem.p

Negative 1449 pIm currently implementing my own custom listview. I idea is that a longclick on a list item will scale the surrounding visible views to a smaller value scale and leave the the current view normal, whilst expanding a view below the current selected view. Once the user touches anywhere around the selected view, it will scale everything back to normal. p  pUnfortunately, theres an issue whereby the last view maybe partially hidden during the scale animation and so doesnt scale back to normal. So when you try to gain focus to the rest of the Listview by touching outside the selected list item, it remains a smaller scale.p  pIve tried a few approaches, from using ViewTreeObserver to storing the positions of the list items to make sure that they get scaled, but nothing has worked.

Negative 1449 pWhat is the canonical way to derive from one of the fancy iterators of the thrust frameworkp  pIm storing 3D points in a structure of arrays. Now I was thinking about a convenient way to get a blas vector type from that.

Which means I can do something like codeit.getVectorcode where codeitcode is a valid customiterator, and pass this customiterators to thrusts compute primitives, like transformreduce. Ive searched a little bit more about the documentation of thrust and found codethrustiteratoradaptorcode. Now the question should one rather use codeiteratoradaptorcode If so, why What are the pros and cons of above piece of code. It seems rather  exaggerated using codeiteratoradaptorcodep  precodeinclude ltthrustiteratoriteratoradaptor.hgt class customiterator public thrustiteratoradaptorltcustomiterator, tzipIteratorgt      public     typedef thrustiteratoradaptorltcustomiterator, tzipIteratorgt supert      customiteratorconst tzipIterator ampzi  supertzi       tvector getVector          return tvectorthis          void setVectorconst tvectoramp v          this  ttuplev           friend class thrustiteratorcoreaccess  codepre  pI dont know if this works, as I didnt try.p  pSo the question is What is the canonical way doing thisp  pRelated to this is another question A functor used by thrusttransformreduce or thrusttransformiterator must accept the underlying type of a given iterator, not the iterator itself. So above customiterator is pretty much useless. Is there a way to accept an iterator instead of an dereferenced iterator in the operator member function of the used functorp  pYou may ask yourself why I want a derived iterator with this additonal getters and setters, as above examples suggest that codetvectorcode is initialised with the underling tuple of the zipiterator anyway. But this is only an example, and there is a more complex case, where above concept would be a very convenient way to go.p

Negative 1449 pI have a cartoon character in a UIImage that is added as a subview to my main UIView.  I take the centre coordinates of the image along with a randomly generated CGPoint and use trig to find the angle that the character needs to rotate to point in the right direction. I use UIView animation within a block. The first part does the rotate, then the completion for the first part does the move to the new location, then the completion for the inner block calls the animation loop again.  This rotatemove sequence continues until the user stops it  so essentially, the character is continually moving around the screen.p  pIt seems to be working for the first rotatemove sequence, but then it starts to face the wrong way.

Negative 1449 pI am working on a project where I am logging some signals 1D arrays into a binary file. I can store large amount of data usually several giga bytes. Now I would like to load those files back. p  pI have two visual components. One is called Overview and other is just a plain YT chart. Overview should give users idea what is in the complete file large file while chart just shows a part of the file usually part which is selected in overview with resizable rectangleband. p  pBecause files can be really large loading to memory is not optimal at all so the main idea is to load to memory max. several MB only important data  visible data. So loading and displaying is done on user demand. If user zooms on chart, data needs to be reloaded with more data points from file. p  pMy question is how to draw Overview component to show the whole content of file in the best way without really loading all samples from file. Lets say my files are larger than 10GB and I would like to give users idea what is in file but I can draw max. 16k samples on Overview component p  pIs there any method to store any additional data like indexing, smaller data chunks, images... during logging for later loading and drawing Overview component Currently I am storing only samples but adding additional data wouldnt be a problem. Do you have any experiences with that an how you did itp  pTo get an idea what I am doingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comn8afW.png altenter image description herep

Negative 1449 pIve been stumped by this for the whole day, PLEASE HELP. Ive searched high and low and cant figure this out.  p  pIve created an OutlineViewController which I want to handle my outline view tasks and datasource.  I was able to have it work just fine if I used appDelegate as my datasource and connected it to the OutlineView in the interface builder.  But I cant seem to get it to work when setting the datasource programatically to its self or programmatically to appdelegate for that matter.  Is this being overrided somehowp  pStrange thing I noticed.  When debugging, with the appdelegate connected as datasource via interface builder the mainOutlineView property has its datasource listed as nothing.  When I set it programmatically it shows its linked up, but doesnt work.p  pAny suggestions or examples pleasep  pOutlineViewController.hp  precodeimport ltCocoaCocoa.hgt  interface OutlineViewController  NSOutlineView ltNSOutlineViewDataSource, NSOutlineViewDelegategt      NSMutableDictionary firstParent     NSMutableDictionary secondParent     NSArray list   end codepre  hr  pOutlineViewController.mp  precodeimport OutlineViewController.h  static NSUserDefaults ud1  nil  implementation OutlineViewController  pragma mark Initialization   idinit      ud1  [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]     if self  [super init]           use ud if you want to initialize via init          ud  [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]         firstParent  [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeysJames,parent,[NSArray arrayWithObjectsMary,Charlie, nil],children, nil]          secondParent  [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeysElisabeth,parent,[NSArray arrayWithObjectsJimmie,Kate, nil],children, nil]          list  [NSArray arrayWithObjectsfirstParent,secondParent, nil]         [self setDataSourceself]         [self setDelegateself]          NSLoginit OutlineViewController          return self   pragma mark NSOutlineView Data Source Methods   BOOLoutlineViewNSOutlineView outlineView isItemExpandableiditem      if [item isKindOfClass[NSDictionary class]]  [item isKindOfClass[NSArray class]]          return YES     else          return NO         NSIntegeroutlineViewNSOutlineView outlineView numberOfChildrenOfItemiditem          if item  nil  item is nil when the outline view wants to inquire for root level items         return [list count]           if [item isKindOfClass[NSDictionary class]]          return [[item objectForKeychildren] count]           return 0    idoutlineViewNSOutlineView outlineView childNSIntegerindex ofItemiditem       if item  nil  item is nil when the outline view wants to inquire for root level items         return [list objectAtIndexindex]           if [item isKindOfClass[NSDictionary class]]          return [[item objectForKeychildren] objectAtIndexindex]           return nil    idoutlineViewNSOutlineView outlineView objectValueForTableColumnNSTableColumn theColumn byItemiditem       if [[theColumn identifier] isEqualToStringchildren]          if [item isKindOfClass[NSDictionary class]]              return [NSString stringWithFormatli kids,[[item objectForKeychildren] count]]                   return item      else          if [item isKindOfClass[NSDictionary class]]              return [item objectForKeyparent]                    return nil    BOOLoutlineViewNSOutlineView outlineView shouldExpandItemiditem          return YES    BOOLoutlineViewNSOutlineView outlineView shouldCollapseItemiditem      return YES    voiddealloc      NSLogdeallocating , self   end codepre  hr  pAppDelegate.hp  precodeimport ltCocoaCocoa.hgt import OutlineViewController.h  interface AppDelegate  NSObject ltNSApplicationDelegategt      idltNSOutlineViewDataSourcegt oldDataSource     idltNSOutlineViewDelegategt oldDelegate   property assign IBOutlet NSWindow window property weak IBOutlet NSTextField singerName property nonatomic IBOutlet OutlineViewController mainOutlineView   IBActionaddSingeridsender  end codepre  hr  pAppDelegate.mp  precodeimport AppDelegate.h  implementation AppDelegate   voidapplicationDidFinishLaunchingNSNotification aNotification      NSLogappDidFinishLaunching     mainOutlineView  self.mainOutlineView.init    voidawakeFromNib      NSLogawakeFromNib     self.mainOutlineView  [[OutlineViewController alloc] init]          [mainOutlineView reloadData]    IBActionaddSingeridsender      NSLogAdd Singer Clicked , self.singerName.stringValue      NSMutableArray tempArray  [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]     tempArray  [[firstParent valueForKeychildren] mutableCopy]      [tempArray addObjectself.singerName.stringValue]     [firstParent setObjecttempArray forKeychildren]      self.singerName.stringValue       [self.mainOutlineView reloadData]  end codepre

Negative 1449 pIm implementing an app, which is generating hundreds of thousands rows in 4 threads. Each thread opens a separate connection to cassandra.p  pEvery item of the table has a unique hash identifier String, but the primary key is an uuid.p  pThe process of the item persisting is the followingp  p1 The item is created and its hash is computed.  2 Then a lookup for the hash is being executed in a second table, which pairs hashes accordingly to the items uuids. 3 If a hash  uuid pair is found, a lookup for the items uuid is being executed 1st table again and since the item has to exist because a hash  uuid pair was found, the item is loaded from cassandra to JPA and its updated afterwards. When no hash  uuid pair is found, a new item is created in the corresponding table and a new hash  uuid pair is saved as well.p  pThe data generation has two steps. The first step is running with empty tables and generates the first datasets. No errors happen there, because in the step nr. 3, a hash  uuid pair is never found, so no updates occur.p  pIn the second step, the whole algorithm runs again, but already on populated data tables. In this step, random errors occur while reading the data items byt their correspnding uuids primary keys  sometimes the server doesnt retun complete text data proper JSON strings are stored in the table, but incomplete JSON strings are retrieved into the application.p  pIm completely sure, that my algorithm is correct, because the same algorithem worked with hibernate and mysql, even with postgresql but since I need faster writes, Im playing around with cassandra.p  pI am using a macbook pro with 16 GB RAM, for the work with cassandra I use the Kundera library supports JPA. As for cassandra, I have tried the datastax 2.0.4 version, and also the 2.0.7 version downloaded directly from the Apache site. There is no cluster, only one instance is running locally on my machine, on an external SSD drive. Kundera is using CQL v3.p  pHas anybody an idea, how this behaviour could occur Is there a bug in the datastax cassandra driver or in Kundera Or am I using cassandra wrong and the database shouldnt be used this way Or are there any configuration tweaks which I might have forgottenp  pThe only thing I have changed in the cassandra configuration file are all the timeouts, because I was getting too many TimeoutExceptions with the default values the timeouts occured during primary key lookupsp

The only thing Ive been able to find online about the life cycle of a PHP object is that it begins at the start of a script and ends at the end of a script.  Does that imply that my query object is instantiated every time I call one of its methods and garbage collected when that particular method ends  Moving the logic out of that class and into the script caused my logic to work.

Negative 1449 pUntil today, I have been using the macports version of codepython27code and installing python packages through macports.  Today, I needed some packages which were not available through macports I learned about pip and found them there.  After installing these packages through pip, however, I realized that neither pip nor macports could see what had been installed by the other.  So, for consistency, I decided to uninstall all macports packages, install codepython27code and codepy27pipcode through macports and then proceed to install all of my python packages through pip. p  pThis worked fine, but since macports does not know about my pipinstalled python packages, I ran into trouble when installing something else which depends on python e.g., inkscape macports tried to install its own version of, e.g. codepy27numpycode already installed by pip and then failed installation because it already exists and does not belong to a registered port.p  pIs there a consistent way to use pip and to get macports to recognize that the python packages it might need for something else are already installedp

Negative 1449 pIve been working on a few programming projects lately, and Ive been running into some issues with managing object lifespans and general resource fundamentals. Im a selftaught programmer, so this may be a very basic issue that Ive just overlooked. One of the issues that Ive been having has been related to managing containers of objects, especially in situations where you have a referencepointer to a single element and you need to remove it from anyall of the containers that might also be holding a referencepointer to it.p  pHeres a pseudocode example thats Ive been struggling withp  precodeclass GameBoard      VectorltGamePiecesgt activePieces  All pieces on the board..     VectorltMatchgt matchList      public void scanBoardForMatchingNeighbors     public void removeMatchingPieces    class Match  Represents a group of matching pieces as a single object.      VectorltGamePiecesgt matchingPieces  codepre  pIf I have a GameBoard with multiple pieces on it something like chesscheckers, or even like Dr.MarioTetrisetc., each piece can be matched with another piece of the same colortypeetc. p  pWhen multiple pieces are found to be matching, a Match object is created and it internally references the matching pieces. Moving 3 blue pieces together would create a match object that references those 3 blue objects, and moving 6 yellow pieces together would create another new match object that references those 6 yellow pieces. Those matches would then be added into the matchList.p  pWhile pieces are matched and therefore, referenced by match objects inside the matchList, they might be animated, change color, or have different interactions, etc., for some amount of time before theyre ready to be removed from the game altogether. However, because theyre still on the board in the same spaces theyre now being referenced by both containers activePieces and the matches in the matchList.p  pHowever, because these pieces are now referenced by multiple containers, Im struggling with finding a good way of removing pieces from both. Heres an example of the algorithm that I was considering using for removeMatchingPiecesp  precodepublic void removeMatchingPieces      iterate through container of matches matchList..        award points, play animations, etc. for each match in the list..         within each match, iterate through each piece..            remove each piece reference from the list of activePieces in the game board.. which involves either storing indices or using search algorithms         Finally, remove the match object from the matchList in the game board after its been processed..  codepre  pThe issue that Ive been having is that, while Im scanning through the list of matches and I grab a piece that is part of a match, I want to both remove it from the list of matches after its been processed AND remove it from the game board. The problem is, Im iterating through the match container, so when I want to delete each piece from the game boards activePieces container I cant. p  pstrongI spent last night thinking about how to address this, and I came up with two ideasstrongp  pstrong1.strong Have each piece internally store their own index within the container of activePieces. Im not sure that this is the greatest idea, as it seems errorprone and a little bit encapsulation breaking.p  pstrong2.strong Take each piece in the match, and then iterate through the container of activePieces in the game board while comparing references. If the references match, the objects are the same and the index is the number of iterations used in the loop. What concerns me is that this seems like it could be expensive if there are many matching pieces.p  pstrongSo whats the best way to crosscheck multiple containers of objects references to find the same object so that I can properly delete it or, depending on the language, pass it over to the garbage collectorstrongp

Negative 1449 pWe have an existing app that uses Javascript and embeds flashflex.

Is there any way to make flex load files from the file system automatically without the user having a web server setup I know it can be done with AIR but we would prefer not to do that. Also if we are forced to use AIR, is it possible to embed an air application in a web page the same way as you embed a flex app The flex app is embedded seamlessly as shown herep  ol liGo to www.eyespeakpro.com Click on free trial after choosing your gender. 2 Then click on Conversation in daily life course, click on the first lesson, click goli liIgnore that lesson and click on the speech bubble 2nd from the left in the bottom right corner.

Negative 1449 pI have the following piece of code for reading a value from a table and then increment it then enter the incremented value in the table.This code is for a LANproject and is in a servlet. So when concurrent clients accesses this servlet then they would read the value at the same time and thus increment the value at the same time too and then enter the value in the table, then there will be multiple rows of the same value which i dont want. I can avoid it by assigning unique attribute to the variable in the table itself but then a separate process would run in the database. So, I want to avoid this situation from the client side itself and so I am thinking of synchronizing the statement object.

The method in my appdelegate gets called whenever I do a tab bar based segue, but not when I do a push segue in a navigation controller.  p  pIve seen several answers that want me to subclass navigation controllers, but there has to be a more straight forward way.p  pI have an app with three tabs.  Tab 1 is just a home screen.  Tab 2 has a navigation controller feeding through two tableviewscontrollers, and the last table view segues into a simple view controller.  Tab three goes to one tableviewcontroller which then does a push segue into the same simple view controller where tab 2 terminates.  p  pI want that terminating view controller to always be in portrait.  The other scenes should be able to switch between portrait and landscape as needed.p  pI am in xcode5 IOS7.br Thanksp

Negative 1449 pThere are many situations where one solution could work better.p  pstrongCase 1strong A project has an id. If you search by id and cant find it then you could throw an exception.p  pstrongCase 2strong A project has a client that is optionalnot assigned yet. You get the project then lazy load the client. Because its optional a null should be returned instead of an Exception.p  pstrongCase 3strong A user searches for a project by name. The project might or might not exists. Is this an exceptional situation You could say its an exception because the person that makes the search should know whats he looking for. Or you could say you expect people to search for the wrong things and then you could return a null.p  pAnyway, there are 3 cases with different expected results. Whats a good approach to solve this and still be consistentp

Negative 1449 pI am trying to produce two files through marshaling from csv with the help of apache camel. I trigger the production of the file sending an empty message through an active mq route which runs a method in a java class.

It logs the below message and then recalls the method that trigered the production of the files. Only difference between the two routes is the size of the List that gets send to the direct route which I log before sending the list to the route segment list2csvFullDataRest.size  11379.p  pWhy does this happen What is the restriction and from who How can I make this workp  plog filep  precode20140723 164255,305INFO SegmentNumbersJob         .SegmentNumbersJob  1443251.2.1.SNAPSHOTsegment list2csvFullDataRest.size  11379  [segmentNumberFullDat] [segmentNumberFullDat] [directsegmentNumbersFullDataRest                                             ] [       245] [segmentNumberFullDat] [marshal16         ] [marshal[org.apache.camel.model.dataformat.CsvDataFormat3808692b]             ] [       245] [segmentNumberTestRou] [segmentNumberTestRou] [amqNonXAapp.campaign.segmentNumbersJobasyncConsumerfalseampconcurrentConsu] [     55861] [segmentNumberTestRou] [to95              ] [beansegmentNumbersJobmethodexecute                                           ] [     55860]         Headers             breadcrumbIdIDthodorispc53142140612651541711111, CamelRedeliveredfalse, CamelRedeliveryCounter0, JMSCorrelationIDnull, JMSDeliveryMode2, JMSDestinationqueueapp.campaign.segmentNumbersJob, JMSExpiration0, JMSMessageIDIDthodorispc53142140612651541711111, JMSPriority4, JMSRedeliveredfalse, JMSReplyTonull, JMSTimestamp1406126516635, JMSTypenull, JMSXGroupIDnull, JMSXUserIDnull  20140723 164256,629INFO SegmentNumbersJob         .SegmentNumbersJob   663251.2.1.SNAPSHOTGenerating segment reports... codepre  proute that triggers the method to produce the filesp  precodefromamqNonXAapp.campaign.segmentNumbersJobconcurrentConsumers1ampmaxConcurrentConsumers1ampasyncConsumerfalseampdestination.consumer.prefetchSize1amptransactedtrue .routeIdsegmentNumberTestRoute .autoStartuptrue .inOnlybeansegmentNumbersJobmethodexecute codepre  proute that marshals the List like a csv and exports it as a filep  precodefromdirectsegmentNumbersFullDataRest .autoStartuptrue .marshal.csv .end codepre  pcode in the class segmentNumbersJob where the method execute is that sends the List to a direct route with the help of a ProducerTemplatep  precodeEndpointInject private ProducerTemplate segmentNumbersJobSender ListltMapltString, Objectgtgt list2csvFullDataRest  new ArrayListltMapltString, Objectgtgt  LOG.infosegment list2csvFullDataRest.size    list2csvFullDataRest.size  this is the code that doesnt execute properly even though a same line with a smaller List does segmentNumbersJobSender.sendBodydirectsegmentNumbersFullDataRest, list2csvFullDataRest codepre

Negative 1449 pSo I have inventory on a web site. I transfer inventory from my local computer, to my hosted website every day, to keep it up to date. So I am basically making changes on my local computer, and then letting all the updates go live every night by using mysqldump to grab the inventory. I used to have my web site on shared hosting and it worked great. The site kept having downtime, so I tried to upgrade to Bluehosts VPS server. Well now the server Im on is configured differently and the dump is no longer working. p  pHere is what happens The dump runs about 25 of the way, and then quits. Out of 40k inventory items, it only uploads 911k each time I try. Leads me to think theres either a timeout issue, or a data size issue. The whole process used to upload in 1 minute, and now quits in about 20 seconds.p  pWhat Ive already tried is changing the mysql config file my.cnf file by adding these linesp  precodenetreadtimeout  7200 netwritetimeout  7200 codepre  pAnd heres my Codep  precodeltphp inisetmaxexecutiontime, 0 settimelimit0 inisetsetmemorylimit, 1 inisetdisplayerrors, 1  errorreportingEALL  include globeglobalvariables.php  output  exec mysqldump h .localbusinessip.  u.localbusinessdbadminlogin.  p.localbusinessdbadminpassword.  .localbusinessinventorydbname.  .localbusinessinventorytablename.  mysql h .webdbhost.  u.webdbadminlogin.  p.webdbadminpassword.  .webdbname  echo done gt codepre  pI have also tried changing the first line of the exec top  precode mysqldump nohup h .localbusinessip. codepre  pBut the nohup simply makes it skip the whole operation as if its a bad command or something.p  pIve also tried shellexec, system, and passthru or passthru.

Negative 1449 pIn the Visual Studio 2012 version of Crystal Reports 13 there is a threshold that throttles concurrent reports, this also includes sub reports, to 75 reports across a machine. This means if there are 5 web applications on a given server all opened reports across all 5 web applications counts toward the 75 report limit.p  pThe error manifests itself in different ways and may result in the following errors Not enough memory for operation. or The maximum report processing jobs limit configured by your system administrator has been reached.p  pThe problem is the reports are not disposed and they continue accumulate until the 75 limit is hit. To fix this issue, the reports have to be disposed of at the earliest possible time. This sounds simple, but is not as straightforward as it seems. Depending how the reports are generated there are two scenarios First is generating PDFs or Excel spreadsheets and the second is using the Crystal Report Viewer. Each scenario has a different lifetime, which we need to take into account when crafting our solution.p

Negative 1449 pI am trying to build a private recipe repository to keep track of our growing recipe collection for our food business.

The procedure I will just store as its own separate file because that will not change with the scaling. I would like to be able to have those inputs be read, stored, and then displayed as a percentage alongside the amount of each ingredient. This would need to be scalable, so if i changed the amount of the 100 ingredient it would scale the amounts of the other ingredients automatically. p  pA sample recipe listing might look like this p  ul liAP flour  200gli liWater  100gli liSalt  2gli liYeast  6gli ul  pAnd I would want it to output like this p  ul liAP flour  200g  100li liWater  100g  50li liSalt  2g  2li liYeast  6g  6li ul  pAnd I would like to be able to have those amounts scale when I alter any of the ingredient amounts according to their percentage parameters. p  pWhat would be the best way to approach this Jquery p  pThanks for any help you provide to this noob. p

Negative 1449 pI need your help.p  pIm currently help two graduate students begin their first footsteps into programming, and Ive suggested Python.  One went straight for Eclipse, since she had seen me using it, and we decided just to catch the other student up with the same setup.  Heres the issue.  Both downloaded Eclipse Luna, both used Eclipses option to download new data for installing pydev from a hrefhttppydev.orgupdates relnofollowhttppydev.orgupdatesap  pOnly one debugger works.  When starting the pydev debugger, usually Eclipse puts a line in the console such as pydev debugger starting then it jumps to the debug perspective.  For one student on starting the debugging process the console outputsp  ppydev debugger starting pid 4024 eclipsepluginsorg.python.pydev3.9.0.201411111611pysrcpydevd.py, line 2183, in p  pand does not move onto the debugging perspective.p  pI have never came across this before, and my two days of searching for answers has come to nothing. Thanks in advance for the help.p
Negative 1449 pI have created an Android game where I use TextureAtlas generated from the TexturePacker tool. I have paid an artist to create good quality assets. So I have these nice large png files with alpha, containing all the assets, waiting to be stolen by anybody unzipping my apk. And I would like to protect them  at least a little  from hackers and thieves.p  pI have searched and found nothing except the usual you will NEVER be able to fully protect your app or only thing you can do is to create you own cipher and encryption system from scratch by yourself yes, I am exaggerating a little here. I find these answers unseless for my case because  I know it is impossible to make an app, a piece of code or an asset 100 protected from hacking. The goal here is to protect it a little to make it hard for 95 of hackers.  I know my assets are not the most beautiful piece of art ever made but I also know they are better than those of a majority of Android apps and any game cloning developper will see that.p  pIs there any way to remove the transparency from the png files but keep it in the game Is there any way to add some kind of watermark that would be automatically removed in the app p  pSo thanks for sharing your thoughtsp

Negative 1449 pI have a REST API which is intended to return XML as response. The API is built using PHP. However, internally it communicates with a JSP servlet running on a Tomcat server installed on another machine inside my network. What is the ideal way to invoke the servlet and pass on the response to the end user  In this particular case, there is no processing that has to be done in the PHP layer on getting the response from the servlet. Currently, I am using cURL to do http post from php and getting the entire response from the servlet and returning that to the user. However, the xml response might be large and this might cause memory issues with PHP. So I need to implement the same by streaming the response. p  pThe current implementation code is given below p  pPHPp  precodepublic function curlPosturl,data         ch  curlinit         curlsetoptch, CURLOPTURL,url         curlsetoptch, CURLOPTPOST, 1         curlsetoptch, CURLOPTPOSTFIELDS,data         curlsetoptch, CURLOPTRETURNTRANSFER, true         serveroutput  curlexec ch         curlclose ch         return serveroutput  codepre  pp  precodeurl  httpbaseurltoinvokeservlet data  param1.params[0].ampparam2.params[1] result  curlPosturl,data Header  Contenttype textxml  echo result codepre  pServletp  precodeimport java.io.IOException  import javax.servlet.ServletException import javax.servlet.ServletOutputStream import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse import javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory import javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamException import javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter  public class MyAPIServlet extends HttpServlet          public void doGetHttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response throws ServletException, IOException              doGetPostrequest, response                   public void doPostHttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response throws ServletException, IOException              doGetPostrequest, response                   private void doGetPostHttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response throws ServletException, IOException              System.out.printlnrequest.getQueryString             APIRequestManager apiReqMgr  new APIRequestManager             XMLStreamWriter xmlWriter  null             XMLOutputFactory factory  XMLOutputFactory.newInstance             ServletOutputStream outputStream  response.getOutputStream             response.setCharacterEncodingUTF8             response.setContentTypetextxml             try                  xmlWriter  factory.createXMLStreamWriteroutputStream                 apiReqMgr.executeRequestrequest,xmlWriter              catch XMLStreamException e                  e.printStackTrace                          finally                 try                      ifxmlWriter  null                         xmlWriter.flush                         xmlWriter.close                                       catch XMLStreamException e                      e.printStackTrace                                             codepre

Negative 1449 pWere building an iOS Enterprise Distribution App no App Store approval required that will receive regular data updates from a server which are then relayed to a paired BLE device.p  pWe started off using APNS with Silent Push Messages using the contentavailable flag but found that over periods of extended use iOS started throttling our app and not waking it to process the push messages when in the background.p  pWhen the app was in the foreground or plugged into mains power it was fine.p  pSo were looking at the Enterprise Distribution Path at the moment its for a controlled environmentp  pThe question is, does anybody have any suggestions on how we can keep this app OpenRunning in the background to receive a stream of datap  pIve seen plenty of articles about people using a Sound File on loop, or imitating a VOIP app to do this but they dont seem ideal due to impact on battery life and user experience with the glowing VOIP status bar.p  pWeve been using AWS SNS for the push messaging which is really good. From what ive read SNS also has a direct connection option that bypasses APNS which is exactly what we are after but can this still work when the App is in the backgroundp  pAre there any other ways via Enterprise Distribution that we can use to keep the app processing in the backgroundp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1449 pIn MATLAB R2014b there is a new function, strongcodepcacodestrong, that performs PCA that can handle missing data. In the documentation it says that it performs pca  with the alternating least squares algorithm in order to estimate the missing values.p  pI would like to know if there are any practical references in how to apply PCA with this algorithm without the use of the function, or if there is a good reference on als. The reason is, there is no such function in Octave that can handle missing data and so I would like to code it myself.p

Here is the F code that does thisp  precodelet msg  new HttpRequestMessagex.Request.Method, x.Request.RequestUri.PathAndQuery if x.Request.Method ltgt HttpMethod.Get then msg.Content lt x.Request.Content let req  async      let client  new HttpClient     client.BaseAddress lt new Urihttpold.api.url     let response  client.SendAsyncmsg gt Async.AwaitTask     response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode gt ignore     return response  Async.RunSynchronouslyreq codepre  pIt just returns the HttpResponseMessage that was received from the old API. It works fine in cases of applicationjson and textplain which is what the old one returns most of the time but even though it receives the proper HTML response seen in the debugger it doesnt return it. The response I receive is always from the previous request. So if I get a json response to a foobar request, if I then call foobaz which has a texthtml response, it still returns the response from foobar.p  pAny suggestionsp

The url in the address bar changes to codelocalhost1337homecode but the user isnt redirected. Now the weird part is, when accessing the home page afterwards through the navbar and trying to access the admin page again, the user IS redirected to the home page as intended although theres an annoying flash while the page is reloaded.p  pFor other people asking, this kind of handling has worked, and Im wondering what I may have missed and generally any reasons for why my current solution isnt working.p

The only problem is that the codeHierarchicalDataTemplatecode does not implement a codeTreeViewItemcode directly, so how can I access these properties in the following codep  precodeltTreeView NametreeViewNotes AllowDropTrue PreviewMouseLeftButtonDowntreeViewNotesPreviewMouseLeftButtonDown PreviewMouseMovetreeViewNotesPreviewMouseMove DroptreeViewNotesDrop DragEntertreeViewNotesDragEntergt     ltTreeView.Resourcesgt         ltHierarchicalDataTemplate DataTypexType dataclassesNoteFolder ItemsSourceBinding Notesgt             ltStackPanel OrientationHorizontalgt                 ltImage Height16 SourceBinding TreeViewIcon TagBinding Selfgt                 ltTextBlock TextBinding Title TagBinding Self Margin3gt             ltStackPanelgt         ltHierarchicalDataTemplategt         ltHierarchicalDataTemplate DataTypexType dataclassesNotegt             ltStackPanel OrientationHorizontalgt                 ltImage Height16 SourceBinding TreeViewIcon TagBinding Selfgt                 ltTextBlock TextBinding Title TagBinding Self Margin3gt             ltStackPanelgt         ltHierarchicalDataTemplategt     ltTreeView.Resourcesgt ltTreeViewgt codepre  pMy goal is when creating and adding a new codeNotecode to some codeNoteFoldercode, to make this codeNotecode selected and the codeFoldercode expanded.

Negative 1449 pI am implementing a simple application that consists of multiple python scripts that run concurrently. The two scripts that run at the same time are the one for parsing data and the one for looking up data in the database. Because of design decisions, I am generating a part of the data. This data isnt saved in the database but in json files. In my parser I save the data like thisp  precodewith opena1test.json, w as outfile             json.dumplookuptable, outfile         outfile.close codepre  pThe parser runs in a loop until a certain condition is met. Meanwhile other scripts reffer to the lookup script to get data from the database the data that the parser saves. When the other scripts call the lookup script, he first needs to check the lookup table in the json file to determine which data specifically he has to fetch.p  precodewhile trigger time.sleep10 with opena1test.json, r as datafile     data  json.loaddatafile  for i in data.keys     print i, lendata[i] codepre  pThis might work for some time but I get two types of errors JSON document not found and ValueError Unterminated string starting at.... I guessed this is because there isnt any concurency measurements set when two different scripts try to access the same file. I know that the first error happens because I use w in the parser, where an existing file will be deleted and a new one created, so in the meantime the lookup script wont be bale to see the file.p  pI wonder what is the best way in python to do this Any way to put a lock on the file while it is written in, unlock it when finished so the lookup script can read itp  pThank you in advancep

Negative 1449 pI am trying to convert from infix to postfix, and then evaluating the postfix expression to get the final answer.

Negative 1449 pIm trying to understand the usage of QStateMachine, specifically handling user events that trigger transitions.  Additionally, I want to understand the best way to implement guards.  Ive drawn a state machine below.  Its mostly sequential and not a great example of a state machine, but it would serve the purpose of not blocking since there are delays while waiting for the results of QProcess calls.  Those delays are instead handled asynchronously as timeout events.p  pThe state machine assumes no rndis connection at startup, then periodically runs a longer sequence of events to check for a connection.  Once a connection is detected, a shorter check is run periodically to make sure were still connected and if not, goes back to running the longer check.p  pThis is some basic setup code that is incomplete.  p  precode Set up state machine.  Do this so that checking for presence  is nonblocking.  Delays are handled by framework.  QState detected  new QState QState notDetected  new QState QState waitForIfDown  new QState QState waitForCdcEther  new QState  QEvent timeout  new QEventQEventTypeEVENTTIMEOUT  mmachine.addStatedetected mmachine.addStatenotDetected mmachine.addStatewaitForIfDown mmachine.addStatewaitForCdcEther   Need to subclass QEventTransition and implement virtuals   onTransition and eventTest  detectedgtaddTransition notDetectedgtaddTransition waitForIfDowngtaddTransition waitForCdcEthergtaddTransition  mmachine.setInitialStatenotDetected mmachine.start codepre  pI can call startTimer on the Detector object, which is where this code exists.  Then in the DetectortimerEvent, I can post a userdefined timeout event to the state machine.  I also need to start a new timer with each transition.  The actions for each transition will occur in a subclass of QEventTransition, presumably in the onTransition method.  How do I pass the Detector object to each of these unique transition objects so that the Detector is the one calling startTimer  Also, Im not sure how to implement the guard conditions on the two transitions that have them.  I see the virtual eventTest in QAbstractTransition, but dont quite see how it could be used to implement a guard.  Im pretty sure my thinking is not quite the Qt way, yet.p  pIve looked at the two books on Qt I could find from Summerfield and from Ezust and also at a hrefhttpdoc.qt.ioqt5statemachineapi.htmleventstransitionsandguards relnofollowhttpdoc.qt.ioqt5statemachineapi.htmleventstransitionsandguardsa.  The books make no reference to QStateMachine at all.  The Qt online documentation seems to me to lack sufficient example code for emgeneralpurposeem state machines.  It does a good job of showing how to use existing signals to create transitions, but not userdefined events.p  pAny help is welcome.  Thanks.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com66f3b.png altSimple detection state machinep  pEDIT I realize that I could implement my own simple state machine with a basic switch statement in the DetectortimerEvent function.

Negative 1449 pI have an app where there is a search field on top nav bar. When the user taps on the search field, the keyboard comes up and the background is greyed out. However at this point if the user taps on a cell in the table view, then the keyboard goes away and the cell drills down to the next screen. .how do i prevent this The only way I can think of is to check if the keyboaard is present and if so then just dismiss the keyboard and do nothing. Is there any other way around it p  pI also have buttons in the tableview cell which also activates when it is tapped when the keyboard is up. So I guess I need a generic way of knowing if the keyboard is up and just dismiss and not do any action. p

Negative 1449 pSo I have been tasked with integrating a program called lightSIDE into a hadoop job, and Im having some trouble figuring out how to go about this.p  pSo essentially, rather than a single JAR, lightSIDE comes as an entire directory, including xml files that are crucial to its running.p  pUp until now, the way the data scientists on my team have been using this program is by running a python script that actually runs an executable, but this seems extremely inefficient as it would be spinning up a new JVM every time it gets called. That being said, I have no idea how else to handle this.p
