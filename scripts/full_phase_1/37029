Positive 37029 pWere trying to send push notifications to users using the codenodeapncode module on the backend and the codephonegappluginpushcode module on the client. On our development server and build this seemed to be working, but in our production app on the App Store no push notifications seem to be received. The client is registering for push notifications, has the correct notification permission, and passes its device token back to the server. When I try to send a push to that device from our server with debugging turned on, I getp  precodeapn Initialising connection 0ms apn Loading Credentials 2ms apn 1 left to send 3ms info sending apns Fri Oct 02 2015 170812 GMT0000 UTC  deviceType ios, info sending apns  deviceToken lttokengt   title test title, info sending apns  message undefined, info sending apns  route undefined, info sending apns  params  id undefined   apn Connection established 144ms apn Socket drained 103ms 0 apn 0 left to send 1ms apn 0 left to send 0ms codepre  pThose undefined properties are ones not required to send that I didnt fill in  adding them does not make a difference here. The APN connection isnt reporting any errors there was an earlier error around the certificate not including a particular CA, but I fixed that, but no message is ever received on the device. The only difference between dev and production here should be the certificatesprofiles, and I believe those are configured correctly.p  pIs there any other way to troubleshoot an issue like this Is there any way through Apples developer tools to confirm that device tokens are valid other than trying to send to them, which it is trying to, or to send test messages other than directly through our backend Im not sure how to troubleshoot this since Im not actually seeing any errors. Please let me know if there are other details I can provide that would be helpful here.p

Positive 37029 pI have observed that on iOS 8 and iOS 9, every time I reboot an iOS device and then send a push notification without opening the app, upon acting on that push notification, all my app specific data in NSUserDefaults will be lost.

Only nonappspecific data was there, things like codeAppleKeyboardscode and codeAppleLanguagescode. If my notification handler wants to access app specific data, itll fail. Launching the app will bring back the data.

I need mobile push functionality in order to push events from the backend services to the devices.p  pNow, I am having several concerns on what the best setup isp  ul lipWhat is the benefit of using AWS SNS to implement mobile push For GCM, its easy enough for my backend service code to make a HTTP call to the GCM API to a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comcloudmessagingdownstream relnofollowpublish a messagea.p  pI know that SNS can act as a wrapper for multiple push service implementations including GCM and APNS, and I was thinking that this would help hide the details about what kind of device is used etc from the backend services, but since you need to create one SNS platform application for each bearer anyway, Im not so sure  will my backend code still need to know which kind of device it wants to talk to and go about publishing downstream messages differently for Android vs iOS I can imagine it would be easier than having to write completely different code for pushing messages down GCM vs APNS, but will it be significantly simplerpli lipIf using SNS to wrap GCM, what is the best procedure for registering device endpoints I have struggled to find a decent tutorial for this, and the only one I have found so far does it like sop  ol lipAndroid app running on device registers with GCM using Google Play Services APIpli lipAndroid app running on device registers a SNS platform endpoint based on the GCM token, using e.g. AWS Cognito credentials to access the accountpli lipAndroid app running on device stores the platform endpoint ARN in the backend user database etc, to be used when a push message needs to be sent to the devicepli ol  pI guess it would also be possible to have the device perform only step 1 and then pass the GCM token to my backend service which would create an SNS endpoint from it and store that in the database This would prevent my devices from having to handle AWS credentials etc. But then I would have to implement GCMAPNS specific functionality on my server.p  pIs the handling of expiredrotated GCM tokens a factor in how this procedure should be set up  Is it a good idea to store only the AWS SNS endpoint ARNs in my user databasepli lipAre there other benefits of using SNS as opposed to directly calling GCMAPNS... pli ul

Positive 37029 pA couple of weeks it was working fine, even when we set a proxy host,port,proxyauthentication. There was no change in the proxy settings itself, but suddenly the push notifications stopped to reach the device.p  pThe used library is Javapns2.3.336p  pFor testing purpose, we created a simple code to check if it is working without a proxy. If we test on a system where we do not need a proxy, it is working fine. If we test the same code on the system with the proxy, it is not working. javapsn logs show in both message has been streamed out successfully in debug log.p  pstrongEDIT 1strong Here is the little test code I usedremoved critical data with SOME...p  precode ListltPushedNotificationgt notifications  new ArrayListltPushedNotificationgt        ListltStringgt devices  new ArrayListltStringgt         devices.addSOMEDEVICE         ListltDevicegt appleDevices  Devices.asDevicesdevices          AppleNotificationServer server  new AppleNotificationServerBasicImpl                 SOMECERT, SOMEPW, false       String encodeProxyAuthorization  encodeProxyAuthorizationuserName,               userPassword       server.setProxySOMEPROXY, SOMEPORT       server.setProxyAuthorizationencodeProxyAuthorization          PushNotificationManager pushNotificationManager  new PushNotificationManager         pushNotificationManager.initializeConnectionserver          Payload payload  NewsstandNotificationPayload.contentAvailable          pushNotificationManager.sendNotificationappleDevices.get0, payload,                 false          System.out.printlnDONE codepre  pThen we created a tcpdump and checked if there is a problem with the connection between the proxy and apple server. But looking into the tcpdump you can see that the handshake is fine and everything is sent to Apple, even the content.available was sent and we receive the acknowledgement and finish flag.p  pInbound and outbound TCP packets are allowed over port 2195 and 2196.p  pCertificate is the same created when it worked before. We used it also on the test without the proxy and it worked fine.p  pThe next step would be to test the feedback service with the workaround of having 2 sandbox apps on your device so that we can check the tcpdump again when we receive something from the feedback service.p  pstrongEDIT 2strong emCreated just a skeleton app which does nothing and only connects to the APNS. Then we deleted the original App and we where able to receive a response from the Feedback Service. After this initial test without proxy, i triggered the same code with proxy settings on the other environment. We also received the invalid token id from the Feedback Service. This basically means, that our Push Notifications where sent to Apple APNS but never arrived on the devices. So we tried something else, we reinstalled the app and tested it on both systems. Now it seems to work on both systems. There where no changes in the proxy settings and no changes in the infrastructure. I do not think that this test scenario is solving this issue, but from now on it seems to work.emp  pIs there something I am missing I have the feeling it is a tiny thing I am missing to make it work again...p

Negative 37029 pIn school I have learned that creating UML DiagramsModels is great design practice before taking on a project. I have found it quite useful myself, in doing so I tackle projects much faster, and my overall design tends to be better.p  pIve noticed a basic redundancy issue when it comes to writing code. In Visio you can be very descriptive in your Models. Your basic outlines for your classes can include C variable typesmethods. They are detailed enough that Visio has you choose whether it is C or VB.p  pMy Question is, with this much detail, does there exist an importing technique between Visio and Visual Studio 2008 It seems like you could import that simple model as an outline for classes in Visual Studio, with everything declared except for the actual code within Methods. This would be very useful, especially when it comes to design steps for creating a program. My classesvariablesmethods would already be declared for me. I would just have to go back and write the meat of the code.p  pIve done some searching on the subject and havent turned up much, it seems like Microsoft would have included a feature to do this.p

The problem is that when I call scaleUnitSquareToSize, then call setNeedsDisplayYES I also tried setNeedsDisplayYES on the scroll view, the view not the scroll bars, just everything inside becomes blank.  If I resize the window that contains the view, its contents reappear and display properly.  But as soon as I rescale and redraw, it blanks out again.  Any ideas on how to force the view to refresh properlyp  pAlso, sorry for not providing source code, but the code is trade secret, so...p

Negative 37029 pAs the title suggests, I was wondering how one decides which protocol to implement.  So far I understand that UDP can make for faster transmission of data but with the order its sent in neglected and it doesnt monitor if the data is even received.  To my knowledge TCP is safer and is used when data has to be precise and the reception time doesnt have to be as swift.  But I noticed that different online games use different protocols even though all of them games play quite fluentlywhich Im assuming means fast data transfer.  So Im wondering how can you tell which is used, and why is that protocol usedp  pThanksp

The following query isnt performing as expected p  precodeDim peopleByAgeAndName       From p In New PeopleRepository.GetAll     Group By key  New With p.Age, p.Name Into Group     Select Group codepre  pHere is the very simple PeopleRepository  p  precodePublic Class PeopleRepository      Public Function GetAll As ListOf Person         Dim people As New ListOf Person         people.AddNew Person With .Name  Test Name 1, .Age  33         people.AddNew Person With .Name  Test Name 1, .Age  33         people.AddNew Person With .Name  Test Name 2, .Age  0         people.AddNew Person With .Name  Test Name 3, .Age  0         people.AddNew Person With .Name  Test Name 4, .Age  0         people.AddNew Person With .Name  Test Name 5, .Age  35         people.AddNew Person With .Name  Test Name 1, .Age  39         Return people     End Function End Class codepre  pAnd here is the even simpler Person classp  precodePublic Class Person     Property Name As String     Property Age As Integer End Class codepre  pObviously this is all code setup for testing purposes.  After executing the codepeopleByAgeAndNamecode query, I expect to get 6 groups.  Each containing one Person object except the group corresponding to Test Name 1 and an age of 33.  No matter what I do, though, I get 7 groups of one element each.  p  pAny thoughts  Im wondering if this is normal for LINQtoObjects  Again, its all testing code.  Im just trying to better understand how this works.  It was my understanding that when using an anonymous object as the key, it should do a propertybyproperty comparison for the groups.  I SHOULD be getting 6 groups, not 7.  p  pThanksp  pUpdate  p  pFor the record, the query rewritten in C performs exactly as I expect  p  precode var peopleByAgeAndName          from p in peopleRepository.GetAll         group p by new p.Age, p.Name  into g          select g codepre  pI get 6 groups instead of 7.  I also confirmed that the group key is not available in VB but is in C.  Kinda weird.  p

Negative 37029 pI am currently developing a C WPF project.

Negative 37029 pMy problem I have a page, index.php, that dynamically loads some html contents, from adminagentarea.php, into some divs adminarea in index.php. This happens when clicking the link adduser and a jquery function is handling the loading and inserting. Now, in adminagentarea.php. I have some other divs usertable that is loaded with a table when the adminagentarea.php has been loaded. p  pidadduser is a link lt a  in index.php, outside adminarea.p  pWhen clicking in the table an alert is presented. p  pThe link adduser is still visible after content has been loaded. When pressing it again the adminagentarea.php is once again loaded and the table as well. Clicking inside the table now presents the alert two times after each other. This is bad, it should be only one time. I can see in Firebug that things are indeed happening twice when I want it to happen only once. p  pI have had similar problem and solved it by using .empty before loading the content.

Negative 37029 pI am constructing a MIME multipart stream that is a collection of various filesdata the user has chosen for upload. I then PUT this stream to a URL using asp.net MVC 3 though the MVC bit should be irrelevant to the question  similar applies to all ASP.NET, where it comes in on the server as a HttpFileCollectionBase object which is itself basically a collection of HttpPostedFileBase objects.p  pThis all works fine.p  pHowever, the HttpPostedFileBase only allows access to the MIME media type and filename fields. I have other data which I am putting in thep  pContentDescriptionp  pandp  pContentDispositionp  pheaders in the MIME multipart  but there seems to be no way to access these at the server end. Obviously I realise that media type and filename are the most common fields used and hence I have no problems with having to jump through some hoops to get some of the more esoteric MIME fields. However, I cant see any way to access them at all. Do I need to hook in my own MIME multipart decoding engine into the ASP.NETMVC framework If so, where are the hooks, and are there libraries out there that do this without me having to write a MIME decoder.p
Negative 37029 pI am about to deploy a web app using MongoDB as storage. The problem is, that locally I can build the indexes whenever I want also done automatically  but you shouldnt do that in production. Now switching to production I am not quite sure on when to build the indexes and how often. Should I do it every day Should I do it once a week My project is like a small social network  so lets say I will have about 100.000 users someday. Depending on the amount of data it could take hours or even days to build indexes.p  pI intend to build my indexes in the background see here a hrefhttpwww.mongodb.orgdisplayDOCSIndexingasaBackgroundOperation relnofollowhttpwww.mongodb.orgdisplayDOCSIndexingasaBackgroundOperationa. It will still cause a write lock, but the build job will pause to allow other readers and writers to access the database  so if I there would be a heavy load on the database, a background index build would still affect the performance in a negative way. So it should be done within a time window where the traffic is at a minimum researched here a hrefhttpwww.javabeat.netarticles353indexinginpracticeusingmongodb1.html relnofollowhttpwww.javabeat.netarticles353indexinginpracticeusingmongodb1.htmla.p  pDoes anybody have experience on when and how often to create indexes in production preferably with a large amount of data I am using Rails with Mongoid httpmongoid.org.p

Negative 37029 pIm using the jquery crossdomainrequest JS script to run a list of names from a database through a criminal record search engine.  The JS script uses the httpquery.yahooapis.comv1public vehicle to process the searches to get around the Same Origin Policy.  The problem is, my script runs about 200 names over a 2 minute period a few times a day, and this has resulted in my servers IP address being blocked for periods of time and given an 999 error for overloading the server.p  pCan anyone think of a way around this  It isnt a huge amount of traffic.  Like I said, a couple hundred searches maybe 3 or 4 times a day.

By contrast, emmonotonically incrementing numbersem is a poor solution unless each client is seeded with a starting value that is unlikely to collide with other users.p  pI find it surprising that the IndexedDB spec does not specify or even allow for future support of alternate key generators, such as a UUID generator. Some may suggest that the answer is simply not to use IndexedDBs builtin key generator at all, instead have your application generate its own keys.p  pHowever, while there are plenty of Javascriptbased UUID generators available, many of them seem to be based on Math.random which has known limitations in terms of its emrandomnessem, so might not be a good choice if absolute unique keys must be guaranteed.p  pA native UUID generator provided by the IndexedDB implementors would presumably be more robust and perform better than a script implementedimported by the application one would think.p  pSo am I missing something here, or is this a missed opportunity by the W3C IndexedDB working groupp

Negative 37029 pI am trying to create a trigger, so that when ever I add a new record it adds another record in the same table. The session field will only take values between 1 and 4.

The problem with it using recursion became apparent when I attempted to integrate the library into my own Visual Studio Express 2010 Visual Basic project I got a stack overflow exception.p  pNow I could consider increasing the size memory allocated for the stack but it might be hard to determine what this would be, given that the recursion depth might vary depending on the value to be converted.p  pMy situation requires a reliable deterministic solution so I would prefer to discount the idea of using recursion.p  pI shall do more research and endeavour to write the algorithm from scratch but would rather not reinvent the wheel if it already exists so hence this question. A search on here did not quite give me what I was looking for.p  pCan you point me in the direction of an existing nonrecursive decimal to alphanumeric converter library in Visual Basicp
Negative 37029 pProblem I am trying to integrate adds into a already successful deployed app. HOWEVER no matter what I do, I cannot seem to get the ads working I have tried using both the code version AND the drag n drop gui version. NEITHER of which I can get to work. This is what I see When it starts up it may flash for a split second white, where the ad is supposed to be, but none the less, no adds. It recognizes that it is where I place it, when I place it over a button, the button becomes unclickable. All being said, no default microsoft advertising image pops up. I have installed the ad SDK and have successfully been able to make the ads display in other project with ease. What gives This is very simple page and I cannot figure out what is wrong. It also seems that I cannot place an ad on any of the other pages either... I do have the Microsoft.Advertising.Mobile and Microsoft.Advertising. Mobile.UI included in the project and my internet is working I have an project open at the same time with ads and it works Helpp  pCode I have for the page yes they are separatep  precodeltphonePhoneApplicationPage      xClassAppName.AdPage     xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation     xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml     xmlnsphoneclrnamespaceMicrosoft.Phone.ControlsassemblyMicrosoft.Phone     xmlnsshellclrnamespaceMicrosoft.Phone.ShellassemblyMicrosoft.Phone     xmlnsdhttpschemas.microsoft.comexpressionblend2008     xmlnsmchttpschemas.openxmlformats.orgmarkupcompatibility2006     FontFamilyStaticResource PhoneFontFamilyNormal     FontSizeStaticResource PhoneFontSizeNormal     ForegroundStaticResource PhoneForegroundBrush     SupportedOrientationsPortrait OrientationPortrait     mcIgnorabled dDesignHeight768 dDesignWidth480     shellSystemTray.IsVisibleTrue     xmlnsmyclrnamespaceMicrosoft.Advertising.Mobile.UIassemblyMicrosoft.Advertising.Mobile.UIgt      ltLayoutRoot is the root grid where all page content is placedgt     ltGrid xNameLayoutRoot BackgroundTransparentgt         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt             ltRowDefinition HeightAutogt             ltRowDefinition Heightgt         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt          ltTitlePanel contains the name of the application and page titlegt         ltStackPanel xNameTitlePanel Margin12,17,12,28gt             ltTextBlock xNamePageTitle TextThank You Margin9,7,0,0 StyleStaticResource PhoneTextTitle1Style Width334 gt         ltStackPanelgt          ltContentPanel  place additional content heregt         ltGrid xNameContentPanel Grid.Row1 Margin12,0 Height569 VerticalAlignmentTopgt              ltButton ContentOk Height72 HorizontalAlignmentCenter Margin0,428,0,0 Namebutton1 VerticalAlignmentTop Width160 Clickbutton1Click gt             ltmyAdControl AdUnitIdImage48080 ApplicationIdtestclient Height80 HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin12,458,0,0 NameadControl1 VerticalAlignmentTop Width480 gt         ltGridgt     ltGridgt   ltphonePhoneApplicationPagegt  using System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Net using System.Windows using System.Windows.Controls using System.Windows.Documents using System.Windows.Input using System.Windows.Media using System.Windows.Media.Animation using System.Windows.Shapes using Microsoft.Phone.Controls using Microsoft.Advertising.Mobile.UI using Microsoft.Advertising.Mobile namespace StickeyNotev.1      public partial class AdPage  PhoneApplicationPage              public AdPage                      InitializeComponent                   private void button1Clickobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e                      NavigationService.Navigatenew UriMainPage.xaml, UriKind.Relative                codepre

Negative 37029 pThis is a beginner C homework problem, I know about vector, but it is not allowed to use in this assigment.

Negative 37029 pI have the current scenario to deal with I have to schedule the backup of my companys Linuxbased server under Suse Linux with ARCServe R15 installed on Windows 2003R2SP2. I know I have the ability in my backup software ARCServe to add prepost execution scripts to my backupjobs.  If failure of the script, ARCServe would be specified NOT to run the backupjob, and if success, specified to be run. I have no problem with this.p  pThe problem is, I want to make a windows script to be launched by ARCServe for executing a Linux script on the cluster  If this Linuxscript fails, I want my windowsscript to fail, so my backup job in ARCServe wouldnt run  If the Linuxscript success, I want my windowsscript to end normally with error code 0, so my ARCServe job would run normally. Ive tried creating this batch file lets call it HPC.batp  pecho ONp  pstart wait CProgram FilesPUTTYplink.exe v l root i CISTadminscriptsHPCpri.ppk [clustername] appliadminbackupadminp  pexit errorlevel p  pIf I manually launch this .bat by doubleclicking on it, or launching it in a command prompt under Windows, it executes normally and then ends. If I make it being launched by ARCServe, the script seems never to end.  My job stays in waiting status, it seems the execution code of the linux script isnt returned to my batch file, and this one doesnt close. In my mind, whats happening is plink just opens the connection to the Linux, send the sript execution signal, and then close the connection, so the execution code cant be returned to the batch. Am I right p  pIs what I want to do possible or am I trying something impossible to do  So, do I have to proceed differently  Do I have to use PUTTY or CygWin instead of plink  Please, its giving me headaches ...p

It has one reply which says JMS is not well suited for the integration of REST services, File systems, SFTP, Email, Hessian, SOAP etc. which are better handled with an ESB that supports these types natively. For example, if you have a process that dumps a CSV file of 500MB at midnight, and you want another system to pickup the file, parse CSV and import into a database, this can easily be accomplished by an ESB  whereas a solution with just JMS will be bad. Similarly, integration of REST services, with load balancing failover to multiple backend instances can be done better with an ESB supporting HTTPS natively. emIt only added to my confusion emli liIs the usage of EAI framework Apache Camel etc. an approach entirely different from the pure JMS or ESB approach If yes, how and what are the prosconsli liI was told that ESB alone wont help, BPMor something else needs to be used to define and store the routing logic  is this trueli ol

Negative 37029 pIm not clear about how the codetuntapcode interface is working. From emWikipediaem, I got this p  pemPackets sent by an operating system via a TUNTAP device are delivered to a userspace program that attaches itself to the device. A userspace program may also pass packets into a TUNTAP device. In this case TUNTAP device delivers or injects these packets to the operating system network stack thus emulating their reception from an external source.emp  pNow, lets suppose that I create a codetuncode with codeIPcode 12.12.12.1. If on this machine I have two NICs, will I be able to communicate with this codetuncode on 12.12.12.1 codeIPcode from an external machinelets say 12.12.12.2 no matter what NIC device the second machine is connected to lets say codeeth0code or codeeth1codep  pWith other words, are the codetuncode and NICs independent one of each other, or you need to communicate with the codetuncode through a specific NIC p  pN.B.

Negative 37029 pI am trying to store the stiffness matrix in FORTRAN in sparse format to save memory, i.e. I am using three vectors of nonzero elements irows, icols, A. After finding out the size of these arrays the next step is to insert the values in them. So I am using gauss points, i.e. for each gauss point I am going to find out the local stiffness matrix and then insert this local stiffness matrix in the Global irows, icols, A one.p  pThe main problem with this insertion is that every time we have to check that either the new value is exists in the global array or not, so if the value exists add the new to the old but if not append to the end.  i.e. we have to search the whole array to find that either the value exists or  not. If the size of  these arrays irows, icols, A are large so this search is computationally very expensive.p  pCan any one suggest a better way of insertion of the local stiffness matrix for  each gauss point the global stiffness matrix.p

Negative 37029 pstrongBackgroundstrong Im trying to create my own Vector class to assist in performing mathematical calculations on groups of numbers.  I am overloading the arithmetic operators       to achieve the functionality that I want.  At first, I used a private array in my class and then implemented the codeIEnumerableltTgtcode interface.  Afterwards, I thought of inheriting the codeListltTgtcode class, but after reading a couple of articles, I understand that I should use codeCollectionltTgtcode instead.  Please note that emperformance is very importantem when populating my Vector object with data.p  pstrongQuestionstrong How does the codeCollectionltTgt.Addcode method work  The codeListltTgt.Addcode a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary3wcytfd1.aspx relnofollowdocumentationa is very clear p  blockquote   pIf Count already equals Capacity, the capacity of the List is increased by automatically reallocating the internal array, and the existing elements are copied to the new array before the new element is added.p blockquote  pHowever, the codeCollectionltTgt.Addcode a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms132404.aspx relnofollowdocumentationa says nothing at all about how it works.  When I used codeListltTgtcode as my base class I had access to the codeCapacitycode property and I was able to specify the size before using the codeAddcode method.  However, codeCollectionltTgtcode does not have a codeCapacitycode propertythis is why Im asking the question.  Again, I reiterate performance is very important.p  pSince performance is an issue, perhaps I should go back to using a private array and implementing the codeIEnumerableltTgtcode interface.  What do you thinkp

Negative 37029 pI have data objects with methods for loading, saving, updating data. Then I have objects for more complex manipulation of this data, and to this end they require elaborated data from the data object.p  pSo I started adding methods to the data object for answering specific questions which the manipulating objects need to know. The manipulating objects only have methods strictly related to manipulation or to some feature while info on the data object is elaborated by it. The manipulating objects asks and the manipulated object responds. That is how I imagined it at first. Then I realised they could as well be methods of the manipulating objects or extension methods.p  pI feel the data object is starting to have too many methods related to specific features, and more are to come. Since these features are mainly managed by the manipulating objects, they could be moved and distributed between them. The problem is some of these methods are used by different manipulating objects and manipulating objects are full enough of methods which are specifically related to manipulation. So another option would be to implement them as static extension methods and place them in the namespace where such works are carried out so they are only visible from the working area but can be called by other objects if need be.p  pThe question is where to put methods thatp  ul ligive info elaborated from data object info public info, without any kind of manipulationli liare for the specific use of one or a few other objects for specific features manipulation mainly, but also queries and presentationli lisome use helper business objects, some only depend on the data object and require nothing elseli ul  pShould they belong top  ul lithe data objectli lithe manipulating objectsli lito a static helper class in business namespace li ul  pI suppose the answer depends a lot on which methods we are talking about, on the design of the application, etc. so I understand specific advice may be difficult to give, but I would appreciate any tips which help me make a decision in this and other cases.p  pIn a nutshellp  pstrongWhat are the criteria or what questions should I ask myself in order to choose where to put methodsstrongp

Negative 37029 pIm having trouble getting my head around an absolutely positioned before element. Im after a big quote mark to sit behind a testimonial. I used a before element as it is a font and is therefore scalable for retina displays, saves an extra http request for the image I dont have any other images I could make a sprite with and it also affords me more flexibility of position a background image would need padding on the left of the element, which would mean playing about with my grid and losing uniformity across other pages Im using the CSS on.p  pHope that makes sense The problem Im encountering is that the before element is covering the text above it. Not much of an issue if its just text although still an issue, but theres a link there that isnt completely clickablep  pHeres a jsFiddle of my issue a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nettempertemperKzQZQ relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.nettempertemperKzQZQap  pId assume as the before is on the li element it would sit behind the blockquote and cites but it doesnt look like thats the case.p  pIve tried zindex and cant seem to get it all working properly.

Then I ran it on my own PC with 4G RAM and dual core processor. To my surprise, it has been doing well so far. The memory usage on the PC is kept around 1.5G and a little far from the limit.

Negative 37029 pThis is my first post here, but Im not new to the site call me a lurker. Unfortunately this time I cannot seem to find an answer to my question without asking. Anyway, to the point.p  pI am writing a small snakes and ladders aka chutes and ladders program in java for a data structures course. I had to write my own Linked List LL class, I know that there is a java util that does it better, but I have to learn about the workings of the data structure and that is not a problem. My LL is semiDouble linked as I like to call it, since it links forward, but has another pointer field for other links, which is not necessarily used in every node.p  pWhat I want to know is if it is possible to link a node from a list to another list, which is of a different type.  Poor example eg. How would one link a node of type  to a node of type  Let us say we have a LL of 7 int values [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], and a LL of 7 Strings [Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday]. We want to link the node containing 1 to the node containing Monday.p  pTo be exact the problem I am having is as follows  I have 100  nodes forwardlinked, forming the game board, and a circularly linked list of 4 . I want to link the player nodes to their respective positions on the board, so that as they traverse the board, they can also follow the snakes and ladders links.p  pThanks in advancep  pMy

Negative 37029 pAccording to the a hrefhttpsubversion.apache.orgdocsreleasenotes1.7.htmlsingledbApache Subversion 1.7 release notesap  blockquote   pInstead of a .svn directory in every directory in the working copy, Subversion 1.7 working copies have just one .svn directoryin the root of the working copy.p blockquote  pLets say there are multiple directories in a repository, and when I first checkout I only selectively checkout specific directories. This, as the documentation says, only creates a single .svn hidden folder at the top level directory.p  pIf however, I later on decide to checkout another directory, after the checkout completes, there will be another .svn directory within the newly checked out directory.p  pThe implications of this is that if I try to do a commit from the root level, it will only be aware of the directories that were originally checked out. I will also have to a commit for any subsequent checkouts individually.p  pIs there anyway to change this behaviour or make the two hidden .svn directories merge together Or will I have to do something like check out the entire repository directory structure the first time I do a checkoutp

Negative 37029 pEarlier today I asked a question on how to place images in sequence as part of a whole picture, so that I could generate 2D maps like you see in the old Pokemon games. Everything is tilebased.p  pIve come to the point where I generate the map itself, but it comes out a little funny.p  pIve tracked the problem to when I fill a HashMap with Tile Objects. A Tile Object holds a Name and a BufferedImage.

Negative 37029 pIn Zend Framework 2, content negotiation happens on the view layer and I am pretty happy with it. An example in my controllerp  precodepublic function viewAction      id    thisgtparamsid     user  thisgtgetRepositorygtfindUser      return new ViewModelarray         user gt user,       codepre  pThis either renders the view.phtml template to return html or it converts the user object to a JSON response. A socalled view strategy determines how to render the response based on the request.p  pstrongREST Application Flow in my webappstrongp  pThis type of content negotiation works pretty good for many use casesp  ol licodeusercode or codeindexActioncode returns an array of users  html of JSON possibleli licodeuser1code or codeviewActioncode returns user object  html or JSON possible example from aboveli licodeuser1updatecode or codeupdateActioncode returns a html form. A POST to this url returns html or JSON when errors are present. Or on success it redirects to codeviewActioncode and thus returns the new version of the user  html and JSON again possibleli licodeusercreatecode or codecreateActioncode returns a html form. A POST to this url returns html or JSON when errors are present. Or on success it redirects to codeviewActioncode for the just created user  html and JSON again possibleli ol  pstrongMy Questionstrongp  pThere are a few use cases where the content negotiation is sortof required in the controller layer. I am not sure if I overlook some possibilities are there options I can use in for example the following casesp  ol liDelete a user POST to the codeuser1deletecode. In case of a html view, you will be redirected to the list of users where the deleted user is now missing. In case you want a JSON response, you want to return 200 OK and a JSON object with a message the delete was successful.li liPost a comment to a blog article. In case of a html view, you will be redirected to the post where you see your comment is appended. In case you ask for a JSON response, you want to return 200 OK and a JSON object with the comment you just placed. li ol  pMy goal would be to not replicate the content negotiation already present in the view layer. It would also make my controllers more fat, since I have now two possible responses JSON vs html but that might not be the only case. If I later want to support XML or another format, I have for every action switches for those response types.p

I would also like to use the push segue through out the app, as it is a kind of an step by step app. My question is How I can eliminate the double navigationbar, when I enter the tabbar, but still have the ability to set a title for each view related to the tab and continue to use the push segue and a navigationcontroller  I hope you understand my question. p

Negative 37029 pSo I have a hyperlink which has a css style attached to it which on focus will display a css span tooltip, so when a user clicks the codelta hrefgtLinkltagtcode a tooltip will show up beside it p  pThis is for mobile users as hover does not work so well for themp  pHowever, there is an issue.

Which btw is mostly just a copypaste code I found on this website too which is to prevent MySQL injection. Actually from this link a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions60174howtopreventsqlinjectioninphpHow to prevent SQL injection in PHPa. If theres anything wrong with it, I wouldnt mind advice or tips. As long as if it makes sense because I just started using databases probably not even a week ago so everything is new to me. Now theres thisp  precodeExicu  SQL gt prepareSELECT tags FROM users WHERE userid  a  gt executearray a gt 16 codepre  pcodeExicucode is just there, because I have been trying to get the results from the query if I said that right. Also the 16 is the users ID, but this will change often so thats why 16 isnt just tossed in the prepare statement. Ive tried a lot of things but none of them worked. It either didnt work or made the PHP crash.p  pBut anyway, things I already tried for codeExicucode is codeExicugtrowCountcode, codeExicugtbindParamcode, a while loop with coderow  Exicugtfetchcode, codeSQLgtqueryExicugtfetchAllcode, a codeforeachcode loop with codeExicugtfetchPDOFETCHASSOC as rowcode, codeExicugtgetresultcode, codeecho PDOqueryExicucode, codeecho mysqlresultExicucode, and just codeecho Exicucode. Yes I know, that looks pretty sloppy.p  pBut none of these seemed to work to just show me the codetagscode from the database of the specific user. So thats pretty much what I need help with. Theres no problem when I use something like this codeecho mysqlresult mysqlquerySELECT etc,etc code but that doesnt have protection from MySQL injections.p

Negative 37029 pOk, guys, I spent the entire day yesterday googling and trying out different solutions but nothing has worked. I have a dynamically generated collapsible div which contains various things inside of it. My issue is arising with the text inside the codeulcode I have inside the collapsible. An example of my structure is as follows.p  precodeltul idlist0gt    ltligt      ltdiv iddiv00 class.itemgt        ltspan iditem00gtItemltspangt        ltselect idslide00 dataroleslider dataminitruegt              ltoption valueongtNeedltoptiongt              ltoption valueoffgtDoneltoptiongt                               ltselectgt      ltdivgt    ltligt    ltligt       ltdiv iddiv01 class.itemgt          ltspan iditem01gtItemltspangt          ltselect idslide01 dataroleslider dataminitruegt              ltoption valueongtNeedltoptiongt              ltoption valueoffgtDoneltoptiongt                                 ltselectgt      ltdivgt   ltligt ltulgt codepre  pI am trying to change the text within the span. Thats easy to do with a simple p  precode  item00.textwhatevertext  codepre  p...and it works. But when I try to change the text of any following spans that text is applied to any previously clicked on spans....why does that happen Like if I go and change the text of the codeiditem01code span to strongapplesstrong after already changing the codeiditem00code span to strongbananasstrong both spans will be changed to strongapplesstrong. This makes no sense to me and nothing I have tried has worked. If you need more of my code let me know.  p  precodedocument.onclick, .item, function        var div  this.attrid       var split  div.split ...more codings.... involving the opening of a popup to let user type in span text in input of idthisothername      var name  thisothername.attrvalue        item    split[1].textname  codepre  pI am currently using this to get the text from an input and apply it to the selected li  div  span  .... split[1] is an array index containing the parsed numeric value of the parent div id aka 00 or 01 which is then used to call the id of the child span and theoretically change ONLY that ids text aha.p

Negative 37029 pI have one master document into which I want to insert a number of files.

Negative 37029 pI am writing a code for UART asynchronous communication in ATMEGA32, but i am confused that how to give two diff values to UCSRC and UBRRH regisers as they have same location and according to their functions i need 2 diff values in those registersp  pAccording to datasheet, to write in UCSRC, URSEL bit must be set and to write in UBRRH, URSEL bit must be reset. But in Atmel Studio 6.0 URSEL  1 doesnt write anything in both of the registers and on the other hand, if URSEL  0 then bothe registers get written the same value which i dnt want because of the work assigned to those registers.......p  pI have checked all this in Atmel Studio 6.0 debugger........can anyone help me what to dop

Negative 37029 pI am building a web application for an intranet. And i was required to implement single sign on i.e authenticate the user based on his systempclaptop username. Until today I was very happy since everytime I tested my login page which basically picks my system username and logs me in without asking for a username. That is what I needed. However, today just to test my application from an another system in intranet when i opened the login page it still picked up my own username. Just to make things more clear here is the eg. if my systems name is User1 this login page shud pick up User1 and authenticate with the database and takes me to the home page. However when I tested my login page from a different system which has username User2. The login page still picked up my own systems username i.e. User1 not User2 since I was logging in from system User2. p  pCan someone please throw light on my mistake or something I missed to include.

Even though I iterate through the instances with an array, to call the Neighbour update function on each. This update function calls the randomisePosition function.p  pIt may be due to the arrays, as if I remove an the one instance calling randomisePosition from the array, by colliding with an instance ingame, another instance, but still only one out of the array, calls the function randomisePosition.p  pThis is the code that adds the instances to an arrayp  precodepublic function populateNeighbourCollisionArray      for var iNint  0 iN lt enemyMaxAmount iN              if collisionArrayNeighbour.length lt 3                      collisionArrayNeighbour.pushnew Neighbourthis             level01.addChildcollisionArrayNeighbour[collisionArrayNeighbour.length  1]                        codepre  pThis calls the update function for each instancep  precodefor var i  0 i lt collisionArrayNeighbour.length i      collisionArrayNeighbour[i].update  codepre  pThe update function in Neighbour classp  precodepublic function update      if animationComplete              tracerandomise position...         randomisePosition         gotoAndPlaystartFading         startTimer       codepre  prandomisePosition function that seems to be only called on one Neighbour instancep  precodeprivate function randomisePosition      traceposition randomised     var randomX  Math.ceilrandomRange0, 100     var randomY  Math.ceilrandomRange50, 400     this.x  parentClassRef.player.x  randomX     this.y  randomY                 codepre

I am seeing the latter two above, but would like to see the pointer, and what else might be stored along with it.p

Negative 37029 pIm new to android programming and Im making a simple application that uses a context menu. The main screen displays a menu of flavors to choose from, when you longclick an item you see the context menu which has a list of actions you can take  picture, ingredients, order, price.  p  pHeres the problem  Its really easy to set the context menu to show the same picture or display the same ingredients no matter which item is clicked, but I want my application to show an image of chocolate when I longclick chocolate and select picture  and then show an image of vanilla when I longclick vanilla and choose picture.

Negative 37029 pJust started with GreenRobots a hrefhttpsgithub.comgreenrobotEventBusEventBusa. p  pThere is only one thing that keeps me struggling How do you communicate between different threads so that the onEventXY method is actually also executed within the subscribed thread.p  pIt seems that when you post an event, the subscribers onEvent method is called from the same thread as the thread on which the event was posted. That is not what I want.p  pI want to able to use the EventBus for interthread communication in such a way that the actual received event object is handled by the onEvent method within the thread that received the event object. p  pIs that possiblep  pExamplep  ul limainThreadli libackGroundThread1li libackGroundThread2li ul  pMainThread posts an event on the EventBus, backGroundThread1 receives it in its onEventXY method and executes code within its own thread sets some variable, backGroundThread2 receives it in its onEventXY method and executes code within its own thread sets some variable.p  pIf this isnt possible yet, I am doomed to use Thread Queues, like BlockingQueue, which is harder to implement.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 37029 pI use Abbyy FineReader for ScanSnap to OCR a couple of scanned PDF files. The software claims it retains the original PDF images. The PDF file sizes preOCR and postOCR are almost identical, which is good.p  pAfter the software is done, all PDF images appear antialiased in Acrobat X. Page navigation is much slower than before, and when I zoom inout, the images first go to what looks like the preantialiasing version before quickly changing to antialiased images.p  pa hrefhttphome.arcor.defrankysfirst20131115225131.pdf relnofollowLeft Scanned PDFa  a hrefhttphome.arcor.defrankysfirst20131115225131OCR.pdf relnofollowRight after OCR with Abbyya img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3ZaiK.png altenter image description herep  pI would like to get the original images without antialiasing back. Interestingly, when I open a single page from the antialiased PDF in Photoshop, there is no antialiasing and the image looks like the left one.p  pMy limited PDF programming experience leads me to believe that Abbyy likely sets some kind of antialias flag for each image during OCR processing.

Negative 37029 pI have been performing load testing on a server to test if it can handle the expected number of users that will access a web app deployed on it.  While performing load testing, I noticed that for about 5 of simulated users, the server at least once prematurely closed the http connection.

My question is why would the server be dropping connections if it has the memory and CPU to address them.p

Negative 37029 pIve run into trouble on a project and Im reaching out to the community for help.p  pI will preface this by saying that Im not very familiar with ColdFusion I messed around with it a bit, 12 years ago, and I understand that its evolved since then and Im not at all familiar with Coldbox or Hibernate.p  pI have a Coldbox handler shown below, which pulls a list of event entities from a database and returns it in JSON format. Currently, this works fine everything outside the PROBLEM AREA. However, we now have a need to filter the list of events by another table, called Quantifications. Basically, I need to match all events that a have quantifications associated with them and b have at least one quantification with a status of Active.p  pI had a few logical ways to handle this. The first and nonideal was to simply grab all of my results, and then filter them afterwards in a set of loops. However, this is expensive and would mess with the paging, so I tossed this idea.p  pThe second was to do a join on the Quantifications table, returning all active quantifications and events corresponding to them. However, Im running into duplicates and Coldboxs coderesultTransformercode doesnt actually seem to be working  codeDISTINCTROOTENTITYcode isnt returning distinct entities. I also have a severe lack of code references, and I dont have a way to step through the code easily.p  pMy final idea is this  for each Event, do a subquery of the Quantifications table for Quantifications that are associated with the event, and then get a count of how many are active. If the count is positive, return the event.p  pHow can I make this work with Coldbox and Hibernate I know what I want to do and how to logically solve the problem, but I have very little idea of how to do it in this system, with these tools, and this syntax, and I unfortunately have very little time to figure it out.

Negative 37029 pI have a web site on a flatfile CMS which Id like to deploy via Git.

When I tried to push changes to the server, I get an error.p  precoderemote error refusing to update checked out branch refsheadsmaster remote error By default, updating the current branch in a nonbare repository remote error is denied, because it will make the index and work tree inconsistent remote error with what you pushed, and will require git reset hard to match remote error the work tree to HEAD. remote error remote error You can set receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable to remote error ignore or warn in the remote repository to allow pushing into remote error its current branch however, this is not recommended unless you remote error arranged to update its work tree to match what you pushed in some remote error other way. remote error remote error To squelch this message and still keep the default behaviour, set remote error receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable to refuse. codepre  pI could always change the configuration of the remote to allow this, but I feel theres probably a better solution since this is not allowed by default.

Negative 37029 pI have been assigned the task of creating a set of cards like on Google one and other similar sites using AngularJS for a dashboard. Each card has independent functionality from the rest and they all must appear as soon as their data has been returned from the API. In the future we are going to allow for the pinningunpinning of these cards to the dashboard, as well as ordering to be customized by the user.p  pI have created a carddealer directive that will contain an ngrepeat for each card in an array of card objects. Each of these cards needs to have their own dynamic template and controller, which is where I have ran into an issue. I was able to figure out how to pass in a dynamic codetemplateUrlcode, but the controller is a different story. I have all but got it figured out by mimicking what I watched on a Pluralsight video, I should just be able to pass a codecard.controllercode variable into the directive ctrl attribute like thisp  precodeltcarddealer ngrepeatcard in cards cardcard ctrlcard.controllergt codepre  pHowever, the codectrlcard.controllercode variable in the directive is not being parsed before it is sent to the directive. In the directive I set the controller dynamically by setting codecontroller code and codename ctrlcode. This looks into the element for the attribute named ctrl and returns its value as the name of the controller. This method works when I type in the string name of the directive controller instead of using the codecard.controllercode variable, but simply typing a string isnt dynamic.p  pI need the variable to be parsed before it reaches the directive so that it looks for the proper controller name. I have created a JS Fiddle to demonstrate my issue a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netkPdCk relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netkPdCka. This should return two alert boxes, one representing each directive controller. If you run this currently, youll see in the console log that it is trying to search for a controller with the name of the variable instead of the value of the variable.p  pPlease help This is crucial to the future of our entire dashboard, once we figure out how to pass in a dynamic controller name we will be golden.

Negative 37029 pLets say I have a private, instance, nonstatic, bool method in a thirdparty dll. All this method does is return a value. Nothing else. How would I go about intercepting calls to this method, changing its IL OpCodesmethod body, or redirecting it to an extra, overridden or derived method.p  pI do not want to decompile the thirdparty dll, manually change the source, and recompile it. I also would rather not to save the assembly to disk as this would also involve using a recompiled assembly instead of the original.p  pI basically want to be able to use the original dll  no replacements or file changes. I just want to do what I mentioned above.p  pIs there any way to go about this If so, can you elaborate or post referencestutorialsetc.p  pAlso, I know of virtual, override, and new modifiers, but remember that I do not have the source of said thirdparty dll, cannot get access to the source, do not want to decompile with something such as dotPeek and recompile.p  pThanksp  pEdit I forgot to mention the rest of the infrastructure MainProgram loads ThirdPartyDLL. MainProgram also loads MyPluginDLL. Im trying to change a method in ThirdPartyDLL from MyPluginDLL so that when MainProgram calls said method, it will call the changed method.

Negative 37029 pI am developing a web app which functions in a similar way to a search engine except its very specific and on a much smaller scale. When the user gives a query, I parse that query, and depending on what it is, proceed to carry out one of the followingp  ul liGrab data from an XML file located on stronganotherstrong domain ie from www.example.comrss which is essentially an RSS feedli liGrab the HTML from an strongexternalstrong web page, and proceed to parse it to locate text found in a certain div on that pageli ul  pAll the data is plain text, save for a couple of specific queries which will return images. This data will be displayed without requiring a page refreshredirect.p  pI understand that there is the same domain policy which prevents me from using JavascriptAjax to grab this data. An option is to use PHP to do this, but my main concern is the server load.p  pSo my concerns arep  ol liAre there any workarounds to obtain this data clientside instead of serversideli liIf there are none, is the optimum solution in my case to obtain the data via my server, pass it on to the client for parsing with JavascriptAjax and then proceed to display it in the appropriate formli liIf the above is my solution, all my server is doing with PHP is strongobtainingstrong the data from the external domains. In the worst best case scenario, lets say a thousand or so requests are being executed in a minute, is it efficient for my web server to be handling all those requestsli ol  pOnce I have a clear idea of the flow of events its much easier to begin.p  pThanks.p
Negative 37029 pI have a simple class hierarchy with a base class and a derived class. The base has two protected members that the derived class calls. Coming from some recent C experiences, I thought it would be good to make the interface a bit more fluent and allow chaining of method calls, so instead of calling codethisgtAcode, then codethisgtBcode you can call codethisgtAgtBcode. However, the following code will not compilep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  class Base    protected     Base A            stdcout ltlt A called. ltlt stdendl           return this           Base B            stdcout ltlt B called. ltlt stdendl           return this        class Derived  public Base    public     void Test               BaseA and BaseB are private here.         thisgtA    This works fine             gtB   Suddenly I cannot access my own private method        int main      Derived d     d.Test      return 0  codepre  pThis produces the following compiler errorp  precodemain.cpp In member function void DerivedTest main.cpp1215 error Base BaseB is protected          Base B                 main.cpp2621 error within this context                  gtB   Suddenly I cannot access my own private method                       codepre  pI also tried making the base class methods virtual, but that didnt help. p  pMy C is rusty enough that I cant seem to figure out what is going on here, so help would be much appreciated. Also I was wondering if this is a bad idea because codeC  Ccode and Cpeople arent used to such fluent interfaces.p

Negative 37029 pSetup I have a form built in asp.netc that, on submit, XML serializes its object model and calls a stored procedure with that XML serialized data as the sole parameter.  The stored procedure sends that data to a sql broker queue.  The message sent to the broker queue must be valid XML that obeys the message contract set on the queue.  That message is picked up by BizTalk and processed accordingly.p  pProblem Originally the data submitted to me was just regular English characters essentially held to ASCII charset but a requirement is on the horizon to support foreign characters as well.  In my testing, Ive noticed that if I try to submit something with foreign characters chinese, arabic, etc, I get an error in the queue and the message that gets to BizTalk ends up with  in place of the foreign characters.  Ive added the utf16 xml header to the top of the document, but that doesnt seem to help.p  pQuestion Is there a way I can cast the incoming XML message as nvarchar and still have it be considered valid XML by the queue  I dont want to change the actual type on the queue or recreate it.  Id prefer to change the message in the stored proc alone in some way that allows it to get on the queue.  p  pThanks in advance for your help.p
Negative 37029 pI have just started learning wxWidgets, version 3.0, with C. I have noted, that event handling in wxWidgets is done by Event tables.

Negative 37029 pI have my Solr Server working, including an effective spellcheck component in my main query parser.  Now Im building a set of JSON Unmarshalling classes in Java to convert the query responses into data other elements of our webapp will then interpret.p  pProblematically, the query tokens are returned as JSON properties.  These are thus dynamic and unable to be predetermined in the code.  This is complicated by the fact that the other two results on the same level cannot be parsed as similar objects, as one is the boolean determination of correct spelling, and the other is the top spelling suggestion produced by collation.  p  pWhile I could ignore them, as the top element of the collator usually presents an effective spelling suggestion, it would be nice to be able to unmarshal these elements, as they do include the spelling suggestions for each specific term.  p  pIs there some way to pass in the query tokens eg, pass in args at query time that would be interpreted as JSON properties from Solr to the JSON unmarshaller as the property names for a type of java object that i could build to parse these suggestions  p  pIf not, I dont need them. but it seems a tiny bit absurd to construct JSON thats unparseable into a POJO.  p  pHeres an example of my spellchecks JSON output for the query codeartificail intelligrncecode  p  precodespellcheck      suggestions [         artificail,              numFound 3,             startOffset 1,             endOffset 11,             origFreq 0,             suggestion [                                      word artificial,                     freq 1                 ,                                      word a r t if i c a i l,                     freq 57                 ,                                      word certificate,                     freq 1                              ]         ,         intelligrnce,              numFound 3,             startOffset 12,             endOffset 24,             origFreq 0,             suggestion [                                      word intelligence,                     freq 3                 ,                                      word in tell i g r nc e,                     freq 101                 ,                                      word inheritance,                     freq 1                              ]         ,         correctlySpelled, false,         collation, [             collationQuery, artificial intelligence,             hits, 1,             misspellingsAndCorrections, [                 artificail, artificial,                 intelligrnce, intelligence]]] , codepre  pThanksp
Negative 37029 pSo, I have been reading through some code saw an interesting pattern for parsing data from a data reader. It looks likep  precodepublic static long ParseLongIDataReader reader, string field, long default      long result     var value  GetValuereader, field     if value  DBNull.Value return default       is this next line bad     if Int64.TryParsevalue.ToString, out result return result     return default  codepre  pThis pattern doesnt sit right with me because it hides type casting exceptions and it seems like converting to a string then casting again would be slower than just calling Convert.ToInt64value.p  pAm I off base in this Is there a better pattern for parsing data from a data readerp  pstrongNotestrong  In my case, the type of the column is NUMBER20. Even if this wasnt the case though, it would be better to throw the exception so the developer will fix the issue before going to production, rightp

Negative 37029 pI have been taught that nobody tries to open a door when one does not know that the door even exist. The best defense would be then to hide a door. It could be easily seen in the old war movies  nobody would keep a hideout in the light. It was always covered with something suggesting that there is nothing interesting there.p  pI would assume that in cryptography that would work the same way. Why would then hash generated by MD5 started from 1, and telling what this is a hash in the first place, and then what kind of hash it is MD5p  pNow, I see that sha512 does exactly the same thing. Isnt it a weakness by itself Is there any particular reason why we would have it done this wayp  pThe main question the is Should I scramble my hash before storing it to hide this from a potential enemy If there is no need for that then whyp  h1Edit 1h1  pSince I see answers that suggest that obscurity is not security, I would propose this picture. It is WWII. You have just received a hint that SS is coming to your house suspecting that you are hiding partisans, and this is true. They have no time to escape. You have two choices where you could hide them  in the best in the world safe, or in the hidden hole underneath the floor, hidden so well that even your parents would did not suspect that it is there. What is your proposal Would you convince yourself that the best safe is the best choicep  pIf I know there is a treasure hidden on an island then I would like to know which island it is or I will not start searching.p  pI am still not convinced. Chris JesterYoung so far gave me something to think about when suggesting that there can be more algorithms generating the same hash from different data.p  h1Edit 2h1  pI have moved this question to cryptography exchange with edited comment that  I am not looking for a private opinion but a source of the final decision to keep it this way.

Negative 37029 pWhat i need today is the followingp  pI have built a form, and i have several tables where that form can write to, how can i make this selectable upon opening the form Im thinking that basically, before opening the form, i should choose in another form the table to write to, the thing is, the list of tables to write to is not fixed, i have a form that is used to create tables.p  pFor example, i create table x and table y and table w, which are equal in structure and field names and everything, it just changes the table name itself and the values in the fields. how do i tell the form i have that it must write on table x until closing the form and then after closing, when i am to open again, it asks again which table to write to and writes to it until i close the form. Then i decide to create table u and the next time i open the form, table u must be in the list, how feasible is this and how should i approach itp  pI already have a table that communicates with the form for creating a new table, hence, keeping a record of every table created, so, i can get the name of the table i want to write to, my problem now is how to change the origin of control in the form, can this be done from codep

Negative 37029 pIve tried several combinations but have not found one yet that will display gracefully without adding unneeded scrolls bars.  p  pI have a page that displays a Navigation column and then a content column.  In the content column I am displaying a PDF in an IFrame.  The left hand column is fixed at say 150px.  I need the the right hand column to consume the rest of the width of the page and all of the height of the page.  For some reason when the IFrame is put in the right hand div grows by about 5px and it adds an additional scroll bar that just mucks things up.  I can make the scroll bar go away using the overflowy hidden but that seems to be hack rather than the right thing to do.p  pIve tried it with both an iframe and object tags and the behavior is the same.p  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt     lttitlegtlttitlegt     ltstyle typetextcssgt         html, body                      height 100             width 100             padding 0px             margin 0px             backgroundcolor808080                   divnav                      position absolute             height 100             width 150px             top 0             left 0             backgroundcolorC0C0C0                   divcontent                      top 0px             height 100             marginleft 150px             backgroundcolor 2F4F4F                   iframepdf                      width100             height100              ltstylegt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltdiv idnavgt         ltfieldset classlookupFieldsgt             ltdivgt                 ltlabel forbook gtBookltlabelgt                 ltinput typetext idbook size5 gt             ltdivgt             ltdivgt                 ltlabel forpagegtPageltlabelgt                 ltinput typetext idpage size5 gt             ltdivgt             ltdivgt                 ltinput typebutton idbtnViewImage valueView gt             ltdivgt         ltfieldsetgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv idcontentgt         ltiframe idpdf frameborder0 src065000012.pdfgtltiframegt     ltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pThanksp  pdblp

Negative 37029 pIm working on a project where I pull from the Sunlight Foundations Influence Explorer API to show what industries provide the most money to the politicians in your district.

My problem is that Im a bit new to requesting JSON objects from an API.  I cant tell if I need to fork and alter this gem to fit my needs.

I want to be able to pull an array of objects that have the industry and the amount they donated to a specific candidate.  I can do this just fine in the API framework.

Negative 37029 pI have a issue that I just seem not able to solve. Do not know if this was asked before, I might have missed it.p  pstrongOverviewstrong I am currently working as an intern android developer at a company android experience  3months. I was given a test project to do for me to learn android. The test project is about a news siteapp that you get articles from JSON and when clicking on an article, you get the full article in another fragment. While in the Full article you can save the article as a favourite store in a sqlite DB. Another fragment gets the favourites from the database and displays it in a listview that has 1 imageview, 3 textviews and 1 imagebutton.p  pstrongProblemstrong When I get to the Favourites Fragment displaying itp  ol liIf there is only 1 row, the image displays correctly, no shuffling occurs.li liWhen there is more that 1 row in the listview, the image of the first row cycle  through the images of all the rows before correctly assignpopulate the images to their respective rowsarticles. It takes about 12 seconds for the cycling of images.li ol  pHere follows my listview layout xml, the fragment layout xml and my class file.p  pListview Layout xmlp  precodeltxml version1.0

Negative 37029 pIn my application concurrent writes happen to a single entity, I notice that when more than 3 writessec happen not all requests are persisted. I am making the requests from inside an transaction but I dont see concurrent modification exception either, I am using Objectify so the exception not being thrown might be an objectify thing. I know that for concurrent writes I need to implement shard counters but even there I want to be absolutely sure that if a write is dropped I am informed about it.

Negative 37029 pIm considering using jOOQ as a typesafe, DB dialect independent SQL generator, as I need to create a small database DDL script and a large number of INSERT and UPDATEstatements on the fly from within a larger application. We then provide the files as a download. p  pIve created the initial DB schema manually in MySQL and generated jOOQ classes to work with it. Currently, JOOQ is used to generate a bunch of inserts into an empty MySql schema. This works fine.p  pI would like to offer the user a selection of different DB schemes to export to codesqlitecode, codeMySQLMariacode, codePostgrescode, and if the license is commercial, then maybe codeAccesscode, codeOraclecode etc. e.g.p  precode    ListltDSLContextgt dbdialects  new ArrayListltDSLContextgt     dbdialects.addusingSQLDialect.MYSQL     dbdialects.addusingSQLDialect.FIREBIRD     dbdialects.addusingSQLDialect.SQLITE     other dialects including MS Access available via commercial license.      for DSLContext create  dbdialects           String dialect  create.configuration.dialect.toString         String sql  create.insertIntoEMPLOYEES                 .setEMPLOYEES.FIRSTNAME, fn                 .setEMPLOYEES.LASTNAME, ln                 .getSQLParamType.INLINED         System.out.printlndialect  t  sql      codepre  pOf course, I can recreate the base schema by hand for each RDBMS, but this is tedious, error prone and it seems superfluous is there not a clever way to use the generated Metamodel from jOOQ that I created with my MySQL DB schema to generate the schema for the other SQL dialectsp

Negative 37029 pThe background here is that Im using SaltStack on Windows, and because its Windows support is patchy I have to get it to run a lot of batch and powershell scripts or commands.p  pSalt is a Python program, so it spawns instances of powershell.exe and cmd.exe and either passes them the explicit code to run, or a path to a file. In its simplest model, Salt uses the return value of the cmd.exe or powershell.exe process to decide if the task succeeded or failed.p  pWhat Im wondering is, what controls the return value in each case Is it just the exit code of the last command executed by the shell, unless you explicitly call strongexitstrong with a return code p  pI know in Powershell you have strongstrong and stronglastexitcodestrong, which have different uses.

Negative 37029 pI am using the opensource strongJBoss BRMSstrong application from jboss.org. Hopefully, if you clicked on this post you are familiar with this web application that can be used to develop applications that use Drools rules.  p  pI am following along with the tutorial on building an application that uses a Decision Table to create the rules. That tutorial can be found here a hrefhttpwww.jboss.orgquickstartsbrmsdecisiontableindex.html relnofollowhttpwww.jboss.orgquickstartsbrmsdecisiontableindex.htmla. I was able to successfully execute this tutorial after modifying the pom.xml some. p  pstrongMy question is how can I create my own similar applicationstrong This example application works by importing some Java classes into the BRMS repository and also putting a preconfigured Settings.xml file in the .m2 Maven repository. There are also some folders at another location on my computer that contain 1 a pom.xml file and 2 a src and test directory which contain other things like java source files, compiled bytecode, and some XML files. How can I do this on my own and build my own JBoss BRMS Decision Table application I was able to create some classes and a spreadsheet and validated this with JBoss BRMS but I am still confused on how to a create the pom.xml file, b create the Settings.xml file, and c create the folders with the required program files like java source code to use Maven to build and run. p  pI have been reading the Drools documentation and the a hrefhttpsaccess.redhat.comdocumentationenUSRedHatJBossBRMS6.0htmlUserGuidechapIntroduction.htmlJBossBRMS relnofollowproprietary documentationa from Red Hat on the business rules management system BRMS that is not too helpful as of yet. It is somewhat helpful but not really. I call it proprietary documentation because it is on access.redhat.com which requires a subscription to even download trial software.

Negative 37029 pFrom time to time I get exceptions like MethodNotFoundException and ClassNotFoundException when deploying my web application to a JBoss AS 7.1 server. The reason for this is that JBoss has its own builtin modules which it prefers over libraries in my own war. I know that I can selectively exclude modules with the jbossdeploymentstructure.xml, but I rather just not think about it and have it work exactly as it would when deploying it to, for example, Jetty.p  pIs it possible to configure JBoss to not provide any modulesp  pWhat are the use cases for using builtin modules In my opinion, the duplicate libraries I would have to provide when deploying multiple wars doesnt outweigh the disadvantage of having possible different behavior in comparison to the environment in which Im running my automated tests. I must be missing a vital advantage.p

I wanted to implement the menu structure of my application as well in the neo4j database in order t benefit from mainsubmenue correlations. p  pSo there are MAIN and SUB options whereas a MAIN can have several SUBs but must not. p  pAn examplep  pHOME main ADMIN main  USER sub DESK main   EDIT sub               CREATE subp  pa.s.o.p  pWhile creating the nodes I build a relationship between MAIN and SUB nodes with isparent.p  pSo my first challenge is to find read the structure from the DB again and build an related array to construct the menu structure. p  pI was tryingp  precode Identify all MenuOptions of the main Menu   queryString  MATCH mainMENU RETURN main    query  new EverymanNeo4jCypherQueryclient, queryString   result  querygtgetResultSet    foreach result as row     Echo for debug     echo lthrgt.row[main]gtgetPropertyname . ltbrgt   querysub       MATCH mainMENU name .row[main]gtgetPropertyname.[isparent]gtsubSUBMENU     RETURN sub          querysub  new EverymanNeo4jCypherQueryclient, querysub   resultsub  querysubgtgetResultSet     foreach resultsub as rowsub     echo for debug   echo SUB.rowsub[sub]gtgetPropertyname . ltbrgt  codepre  pp  pBut it seems I get every menu option double  as if I would travers every graph twice, thus I guess p  pa either I havent understood queries correct most likely as these are my 2nd try b my DB model is not correct, maybe Imiss another PARENTNODE that connects all MAIN MENU nodes right now they are not connected, only the SUB is connected to the related MAIN.p  pI use neo4jphp for connecting to the DB.p  pEvery hint is very appreciated.p  pThanksp  pP.Sp  pI made this schema for the data as an example btw. maybe there is a way to make the queries more compactp  precode    create homeMENUMAIN  name HOME      create adminMENUMAIN  name ADMIN      create blogMENUMAIN  name BLOG      create supportMENUMAIN  name SUPPORT       create userMENUSUB  name USER      create groupsMENUSUB  name GROUPS      create localMENUSUB2  name LOCAL      create externMENUSUB2  name EXTERN      create editMENUSUB  name EDIT      create createMENUSUB  name CREATE      create deleteMENUSUB  name DELETE       CREATE admin[ISPARENT]gtuser     CREATE admin[ISPARENT]gtgroups      CREATE groups[ISPARENT]gtlocal     CREATE groups[ISPARENT]gtextern       CREATE blog[ISPARENT]gtedit     CREATE blog[ISPARENT]gtcreate     CREATE blog[ISPARENT]gtdelete codepre  ol liSo there are nodes which are not connected by a relationsship, but marked by the label.li lipWhen I use the queries below I get all menu options that have a relation to the submenue.

Negative 37029 pBasically, Im running into trouble working around an API I have no control over which is locking a file when it shouldnt be.p  pThe method from the API looks like thisp  precodepublic static bool Uploadstring fileName  ...   I have no ability to look inside this codepre  pIt behaves like its reading the file directly off the disk, and not placing the file into memory before hand. p  pThis is a problem because its written so poorly that whenever it fails at uploading, it fails to release the file lock. This means I have to start my application over again in order to release the file  which is a huge pain in productionp  pThe only workaround I could think of was making an individual copy of the file  few MB at most for each firmware upload instance. This could get it working, but then leaves me with the problem of deleting each file manually afterwards since the file lock would be open as long as the app is, I couldnt do it in codep  pIs there any workaround I can do that wouldnt create a ton of issues My only thought is creating a separate C class to hold the static upload function, then find some way to dispose the class and resources after it runs. Any ideasp  pstrongEDITstrong Its a 3rd party API that uses proprietary code to talk to a microcontroller  so unless I want to bitspy and recreate all the back and forth packets, it looks like rewriting the original function is a nogo.p

Negative 37029 pIm using codeminixcode to compile my code in codeCcode. Im trying to add a mouse cursor to my game, in order to do that I need to read a 3byte packet from the machine.

Negative 37029 pI have a page that is running through the network address for a new server. However, when I try to set it up through revere proxy, I receive a 404 error. The settings on the reverse proxy are the same for this new server as previous set up servers. As far as I can tell, the settings on the new server are the same as previous servers. Are there any settings on the new server that would through the 404 when going through the reverse proxy or is this an error within the reverse proxy The new server is running IIS 8 on Windows Server 2012. The call goes through the reverse proxy fine, there seems to be something going on in between the reverse proxy and new server.p

Negative 37029 pThis app communicates with a hardware accessory. I would like to have the app woken up once every 24 hours to search for firmware updates for that hardware. If an update is available, a notification will be sent to the notification center and the user can tap it to open the app and download the update.p  pNone of the background modes discussed a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationiPhoneConceptualiPhoneOSProgrammingGuideBackgroundExecutionBackgroundExecution.html relnofollowherea seem appropriate. The closest is background fetch which is meant for an app that regularly downloads and processes small amounts of content from the network.p  pThe problems with this all can be worked around arep  ul liNo way to specify how often to wake up to check for updatesli liAn expectation that if content is available, the app will download it immediately instead, I just want to send the user a notification so they know an update is availableli ul  pSo should I use background fetch and work around its limitations, is there a different background mode or API that would be better suited, or is this something an app shouldnt dop

Negative 37029 pI am using SignalR version 2.1.2 with ASP.Net MVC 5 amp NServiceBus and have following requirementp  pThere is a signup page anonymous authentication in which SignalR is used to send notifications. Every form submit will generate a new connection id which needs to be kept in a collection so that I can send response to the client. Context.User.Identity.Name is empty hence connections.Addname, Context.ConnectionId cannot be used in OnConnected hub event as given in this a hrefhttpwww.asp.netsignalroverviewguidetotheapimappinguserstoconnections relnofollowpostap  pSimilar problem exists in Login page.p  pIf there is a possibility to control the ConnectionId then I could overcome this situation but it looks like new version of SignalR has got rid of connection factory.p  pI am using Redis cache so one option is to write my own connection management code to keep these connection ids in it.p  pSecond option is to use Forms Authentication in such a way that a Anonymous Role is assigned to these users which restricts the usage to anonymous viewscontrollers but gives a Name to the user so that Context.User.Identity.Name is not empty. With this I can use built in SignalR mechanism to manage connection ids for me.p

Within this timespace when i check the database the persono  table doesnt show any data in it. why isnt it showing the age and name value in it immediately after save. though it appears after the

In this case, Subscriber A is fast 20 milliseconds and Subscriber B is slow 500 milliseconds, so we need some sort of lock or gate so subscriber A waits for subscriber B to finish before moving onto the next event, or viceversa if subscriber B is faster than subscriber A.p  pOf course, this is what occurs naturally in single threaded mode, but then one loses the ability for the same event to be processed in parallel by many subscribers, which means I cannot easily take advantage of all of the cores on my system.p  h2Updateh2  pThank you Jonas Chapuis for your answer using codeSortcode.p  pHowever, in this particular case, what I am aiming for is to stop fast subscribers getting ahead of slow subscribers when consuming events, i.e. I need some sort of lock or gate so that a fast subscriber will wait until all of the slow subscribers have finished with the event, before moving onto the next event.p  pIn other words, I want emall subscribers to move in lock step through the eventsem, with no individual subscriber getting ahead of the rest. The RX event will created on a single thread, so they will never get out of order.p  h2Updateh2  pAfter some months, it turns out that I was using the wrong architecture, and this was the wrong question to ask.p  pInstead of observing on codeThreadPoolScheduler.Instancecode, I should be observing on an codeEventLoopSchedulercode which locks all subscriptions to a single thread. This preserves the order.p  pIn order to get parallelism for time series data, its better to divide the data processing into a pipeline with multiple stages, with each thread concentrating on a single pipeline stage. This is much simpler to deal with, and satisfies all of the constraints above.p

Negative 37029 pI am writing a library that uses shared pointers to build a complex structure of nodes. Since there can be cycles in the structure, and to avoid memory leakes, I decided to adopt the following strategy when building the structure whenever I am passed a temporary object, I use a sharedptr to get the ownership whenever I am passed a lvalue, I use a weakptr. According to my analysis and the way the library interface is designed, this should avoid cycles altogether. p  pHowever, I am having problems in using function overloading to understand when the parameter is a rvalue or a lvalue. Here is a very simplified example of the error I get p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltmemorygt  using namespace std  class MyClass  public     int a      this class contains some pointers to the node structure   MyClass funMyClass ampampx, MyClass ampampy       should produce an object that has ownership of the two others   MyClass funMyClass x, MyClass y       should not take ownership, but just copy the pointer   int main      MyClass x, y      funx, y     funMyClass, MyClass  codepre  pWhen compiling with g 4.8.2 I get the following errorp  precodeexample.cpp In function int main example.cpp2929 error call of overloaded funMyClass, MyClass is ambiguous      funMyClass, MyClass                               example.cpp2929 note candidates are example.cpp129 note MyClass funMyClassampamp, MyClassampamp  MyClass funMyClass ampampx, MyClass ampampy           example.cpp189 note MyClass funMyClass, MyClass  MyClass funMyClass x, MyClass y           codepre  pSo, apparently the compiler cannot distinguish between the two calls. I thought the rvalue function has precedence over the passbyvalue function, but evidently I was wrong. p  pAlso I cannot declare the function to take const references, because I  want just to take ownership and then later modify the object at will, so the reference should not be constant. p  pAny ideas on how I may solve this problem p

Negative 37029 pOur current production version is PC 11.52 patch1 and our company is going to start IE11 roll out soon. We dont have many issues with our current production version so we would like to use it. But 11.52 doesnt support IE11. Because full migration needs lots of work we have more than 100 projects, we are investigating alternative solutions. We tested 11.52 Vugen with IE11 and it seems, that Vugen can record scripts in WinInet mode. Would it be possible to record scripts using WinInet level capture and run them using Sockets Is there some limitations using WinInet capturing and what pitfalls this approach might bringp

Negative 37029 pOk, so I am making a portfolio site I am a relatively new web student and I am using elements of Bootstrap for my navbar.  That may be irrelevant to my question, but I have a video background as my landing page and my site is a scrolling site.  The problem I am having now is that my About page is under my video background landing page and I cant resize my page to mobile with out my video div and my about div to over lap or just stick together.  I tried using media queries but for some reason they are not working, I dont know if that is because bootstrap is not allowing it or if I am just doing my media queries are wrong  If you could take a look at my code and help I would love you all forever, THANK YOU for any kind of help. p  pAlso sorry if my code is excessive, this is my first time using Stackoverflow so Im a n00b, I apologize.p  precodeenter code here ltdiv classhiddenphonegt                  ltdiv classheaderunitgt                    ltdiv idvideocontainergt                     ltvideo autoplay loop classfillWidth mutedgt                       ltsource srcvideoshomeVid.mp4 typevideomp4 gt                       ltsource srcvideoshomeVid.mov typevideomov gt                       ltsource srcvideoshomeVid.webm typevideowebm gt Your browser does not support the video tag.

Negative 37029 plong time listener, first time caller, so apologies if my formatting is terrible.p  pTLDR Versionp  pPut serializable class[] into bundleintent within my service.  Send to main activity via BroadcastReceiver.  When pulling object[] out of bundle and trying to cast back to my custom class, dump occurs on my phoneMOTO Razr HD, but not within my Android Studio emulator.p  pI have only gotten into Android within the past few months, and have relied heavily on their tutorialsgoogle to learn, so there is a good chance this may be a gap.p  pOk, so my purpose here is to have a Service running during my various activities, and to have said service be in charge of server communication creating a Chess game essentially for android experience.  Emulator was working as intended during my testing,but when i run on my phone, it dumps. p  pI have had other serializable objects being passed between activities within bundles, and that previously has worked fine. With the introduction of this service however, it seems to be losing sight of the actual type of Object it is shown via screenshots below, and fails to allow me to cast back from an Object[] to my GameContainer[].p  pMy next step is to try a different phone as well....usage of SharedPreferences was not working on my phone at all the logic for that happens well before the dump occurs, and only started working when i started debugging my phone, despite zero changes in my source code in that time.  My phone may just be borked.p  pHere is the debugging view of my bundles at various timesp  pa hrefhttpimgur.comahu5Tc relnofollowhttpimgur.comahu5Tcap  pimage 1 Here is the debugging view of my bundle after i have put my GameContainer[] in it via bundle.putSerializableString, Obj[] on my Phonep  pimage 2 Here is the debugging view of my bundle after broadcast receiver gets it in my main activity and before it attempts to castwhich causes the dump on my phonep  pimgae 3 ANd here is the same as above, only on my emulator on my comp.p  pI am not sure if the mMap subsets throwing the ClassNotFoundException is helpful...i see that both in my phone and emulator, which makes me assume thats simply because im placing a custom class inside the bundle.p  pSome code for you guysp  pmy Service  specifically the portion under my Runnalbe if state  RequestedGames.  p  precodepackage chess2.Services   import android.app.Service import android.content.Intent import android.content.SharedPreferences import android.os.Bundle import android.os.Handler import android.os.IBinder import android.os.Binder import android.util.Log import java.util.Date   import ServerStuff.ChessClass import chess2.source.GameBoard import chess2.source.GameContainer  public class ChessService extends Service   protected ChessClass theGame protected String myState  INITIAL protected String returnState  INITIAL protected String returnMessage   protected GameBoard myGB  null protected GameContainer[] myGC  null protected int myGameIndex  1 private static final String RM  RETURNMESSSAGE private static final String RS  RETURNSTATE private static final String RO  RETURNOBJECT private static final String RA  RETURNOBJECTARRAY  public static final String SERVERRESPONSE  com.botna.chess2.serverresponse private final Handler handler  new Handler Intent intent private Runnable sendUpdatesToActivity  new Runnable      public void run           intent.putExtraRS, returnState         intent.putExtraRM, returnMessage           if returnState.equalsREQUESTEDGAMES              Bundle b  new Bundle             b.putSerializableRA,myGC             intent.putExtrasb                  if returnState.equalsGAMELOADED                      Bundle b  new Bundle             b.putSerializableRO,myGB             intent.putExtrasb                    sendBroadcastintent           Override public int onStartCommandIntent intent, int flags, int startId      TODO do something useful      make sure our connection is still setup.     try          if theGame  null               theGame  new ChessClass                   catchException e              TODO            Gather information out fo the intent and decipher what     we need to send to the server based on MODE, STATE, PAYLOAD etc      SEnd it to the server, get our response      PUt the response in our intent.       post our updates, which will trigger stuff in the activity.

Negative 37029 pSo this problem has been presented to me and its becoming a huge roadblock in the production of my website. Im not new to excel when it comes to the interface but writing functions is something that I have never had to deal with. I have a table with values labeled by reference number that basically relay a form that was filled out by a certain provider. The column with all the different answers to the fields Yes, it has different field answers in one column, sigh needs to be broken up so I can label them with column headers in order to eventually import them into an SQL database. The source is current delivered in this formatp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2QjIV.jpg altSource data p  pWhat I need to do is be able to fill out a columnbased version of these values that looks likep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comg14hX.jpg altExpected Aggregate Resultsp  pThe criteria for creating columns is based on the values in A ref  B C and D. Im guessing I need to create some sort of conditional statement that checks if C and D are equal to a certain value C and D designate the type of information that is in E so they are pretty much my key elementconditionals and then places the information in cell E underneath the correct column header. I have been researching functions such as VLookupMatchIndex and I cant make much sense of how to apply them or if there is possibly a better function I can use to accomplish my task. Even a reference to a relevant SO thread would be great at this point. I basically just need some guidance as to what it would take to make this work. On top of that, the reference numbers ascend but are not in any particular order therefore I am wondering if it possible to feed a function a list of reference numbers to increment to once all the conditionals have all been run through for a particular reference number.p  pEDIT Ok so here is my new issue p  pThe images as you requested Original Data a hrefhttpimgur.comhtvzqNU relnofollowhttpimgur.comhtvzqNUa After VBA Script a hrefhttpimgur.comcDQQxE6 relnofollowhttpimgur.comcDQQxE6ap  pThis is the only code we editedp  precodevHDRs  ArrayArrayReference , 1, 2,                    ArrayProvider Name, 300, 100,                    ArrayProvider Number, 300, 300,                    ArrayCounty, 200, 400,                    ArrayAddress, 100, 100,                    ArrayZip, 200, 300 codepre  pAs you can see, the column for addresses does not populatep

Negative 37029 pI have a small program that makes an SSL connection to a server and then copies data from STDIN to the server and data from the server to STDOUT much like codeopenssl sclientcode. Im using boostasio for reading and writing to STDIN, STDOUT and the SSL socket. The problem is that I cannot pipe data from another program my program e.g.p  precodecat  myprog codepre  pI type a line and hit enter, and it all works as it should the line of text finds its way through my program, to the server which responds, and the response is printed to my console.

This shouldnt be a problem if I change my code to codeforkcode off the preprocessor allowing it to inherit STDIN and STDERR, and capture STDOUT which asio can read from directly. That way asio wouldnt have to touch STDIN. This has been done and codestracecode confirms that file descriptor 0 has been left alone.p  pTheory 2 When my program writes to STDOUT, it does something that changes codecatcodes STDIN from blocking to nonblocking.

Negative 37029 pIm using Selenium WebDriver with Java and testng on a mac. I am finding that when I use the Safari driver, details from a previous test is being displayed. For example, in Test A I type France on the homepage text box. In test B, France is then already present on the homepage text box when the browser first loads. I was hoping that each test would not include details from a previous test and keep each test independent. Does anyone know why Safari driver may be doing this or have any suggestions to overcome this problem.p  h2Some further detailsh2  ol liI have added driver details into the testng BeforeMethod annotation in testng.li liWhen I run the same test in Firefox and Chrome, details from a previous test are not displayed.

Negative 37029 pBy using this code, Im changing the image of home button of the actionbar to hamburger menu iconp  precodeactionBar.setHomeAsUpIndicatorR.drawable.hamburgermenu actionBar.setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabledtrue actionBar.setHomeButtonEnabledtrue codepre  pAfter adding a new fragment I want this icon to be changed with default back icon of the android. But i couldnt manage to do it.p  precode        actionBar.setHomeButtonEnabledtrue         actionBar.setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabledtrue         actionBar.setDisplayShowHomeEnabledtrue         actionBar.setDefaultDisplayHomeAsUpEnabledtrue codepre  pAll this methods are making the issue more complicated. Is there any easy way to do this Or should I find the android default back button image and set it as home button indicatorp  pUpdate 1p  pIm using Fragments with Activities. So first default fragment that came with activity should be able to open the sliding menu. So thats why im using hamburger menu icon with them. But if user continue with the flow, secondary fragments should not open the sliding menu. Im trying to change hamburger menu button with default home as up button in this case because pressing home button should direct user to the firstdefault fragment.  p  pUpdate 2p  pI couldnt get any satisfying answer for this and change the actionbar icon with the custom home as up button. It turns out that some icons are defined private in android so using the same default home as up icon seems impossible for now at least.p  pFollowing link, contains the official actionbar icon pack, which you can download and use in your applications for private android icons. But the weird thing is icons are somehow a little bit bigger than the original private icons. The image sizes are not different from the original android icons but i guess these icons has less padding and more visible area. In order for you to use them as like originals you need to change mdpi image to hdpi, hdpi image to xhdpi image and xhdpi image to xxhdpi in your application... a hrefhttpsdeveloper.android.comdesigndownloadsindex.html relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.android.comdesigndownloadsindex.htmlap

I can think of two reasonsp  ul liSince codeWSARecvcode will not block, then I can handle 1000s of clients without having to create a new thread for each client also, there is a limit on how many threads you can create, and so the number of clients you can handle will be limited.li liSince codeWSASendcode will not block, then when I want to send a large file, I dont have to create a new thread to send it if I did not create a new thread then the UI thread will block of course.li ul  pWhat other reasons are there to use IOCPp

I  realized that codephpwordcode does not replace any of the keywords with my input so I  searched what causing it and found that word generates arbitrary tags around my keywords so codephpwordcode fails to find my keys.p  pThen I changed my templates format from code.docxcode to codezipcode to open codedocument.xmlcode file to erase unnecessary tags around my keyword but I cannot open codedocument.xmlcode, it says there is an error in row 2 but whole codeXMLcode file is in row 2 so it is impossible to find where is the error.p  pSome suggested that use codenotepadcode and codexmlplugincode to regenerate codeXMLcode file with proper line breaks. I did it but error still shows the same row and I cant find the error, also I used online tools to check whether there is an error or not in my codedocument.xmlcode but those tools says your codeXMLcode file is fine, sorry for the long explanation, thanks in advance.p

Negative 37029 pI have a method codeparsecode that processes data from an input file, which may have been opened in binary mode. However in some subclasses it would be easier to process the data if the file were opened in text mode. So my question is if theres an easy way to wrap any file to get something that acts as a text mode file.p  pNote that the solution in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10509753convertbinaryinputstreamtotextmodeConvert binary input stream to text modea does not really make it as it only produces an iterator and not a filelike object. Also note that opening the file in text mode in the first place is not an option.p  pIf it simplifies the solution one can assume that the input file is indeed opened in binary mode.p

Negative 37029 pIm trying to create an app for editing guitar tabs.  I have an array of buttons that represent the frets and I want to be able to click on the button to open an alert dialog to set the text of that button to be the number thats input. p  pThe editFret function below is called by the button through its onClick property.  When I run this, I can press on a button and it brings up the dialog and I can input the number fine. After pressing OK on the dialog though, the button just becomes blank.  When I click on the button again, or any other button, the number then shows up as the text in the button.  It also keeps changing the text in any buttons clicked afterwards to whatever the last input value was.  p  pI tried changing the button text to a constant value on a click and didnt have any problems so Im assuming the problem is with the getFret function although I cant possibly see what it would be as its just fetching a string.p  precodeCreate string to store the fret number String fret  public void getFret     Create text input field     final EditText input  new EditTextthis     input.setInputTypeInputType.TYPECLASSNUMBER     input.setFiltersnew InputFilter[] new InputFilter.LengthFilter2      new AlertDialog.Builderthis             .setTitleEdit fret             .setMessageInput fret number             .setViewinput             .setPositiveButtonOK, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener                  Override                 public void onClickDialogInterface dialog, int which                      fret  input.getText.toString                                           .setNegativeButtonCancel,new DialogInterface.OnClickListener                  Override                 public void onClickDialogInterface dialog, int which                      Do nothing                              .show   public void editFretView view     Button button  Button view     getFret     button.setTextfret     button.invalidate  Dont know if this is necessary  codepre

Negative 37029 pIm working through a tutorial on animating sprites using DirectX9 and Im doing everything correctly I just need some help on an issue that I want to correct. So far I can correctly animate the sprite, the issue is that when the sprite animates it leaves behind the image in the previous frame before drawing the next frame.

Negative 37029 pUsing the Laravel PHP framework, Im wondering about the design of resource controllers, where you define a new controller for an individual entity, say, project or article, and then provide methods based on the different CRUD operations. p  pIn the context of my application, I feel like I get more utility by having a controller for each CRUD operation itself  say, UploadController  which is then responsible for handling that operation for every entity that needs it. This allows me to share tasks like validation between similar entities, and I dont have to include operations say, Update for entities that dont need them. It also lets me call a single controller for pages where Im creating many different kinds of entities at once, such as generating a hierarchy of entries like projectsubprojectarticle all from one form. p  pBut am I missing some huge disadvantage to this Why is the strongcontrollerentity amp methodverbstrong structure so popular, vs strongcontrollerverb amp methodentitystrongp

Negative 37029 pI have an array and I want to fill this array using recursion. It is about the Collatz sequence. It is not necessary to know the problem to understand the code. The code I have written is the followingp  precodeint recursionlong int n, int array     ifarray  n0check if I already have the length of the sequence for this n         ifn12doublen1double2check if n mod 2  0            arrayn recursionn121,array1                         else            array nrecursion3n3,array1                   else          return arrayn       codepre  pSo the idea is that if I have an array with zeros except that array[0]1 and if I write coderecursion100,arraycode then the function checks if at position 100 the array is zero. If it is zero, then the function checks another condition and assigns a number to array[100]. This array[100] is recursively defined. If finally it sees a an array element which is not zero, it returns this array element. p  pI expect that in this process of recursion for n100, it will not only find a value for array[100], but also for some other array elements. But if I run this function in my main function, it gives for several array elements a 1 and for array[100] it is also 1, but should be a lot bigger than 1, since I am adding 1 in each recursion. I really dont see what I am overlooking here.p

Negative 37029 pI wonder if anyone can help me with this issue, I cant seem to find anyone else whos wanting to do this with flexboxp  pIve set up a basic Flexbox scenario where several elements li appear in a flexbox container ul.p  pAnd Ive also set it so that the maximum amount lis that will fit in a row before wrapping is 3 done by setting a ul width of 900px and a flexbasis of 260px for the lis.p  pThis all works great, but the problem for me arises in the fact that the text will ultimatley be coming from a database. Sometimes in German so long words. Ive no idea which lis will have long words or not so I need to set them all the same.p  pstrongBasically my questions is...strongp  pWhy when a li has longer than normal text inside it, does the li not extend to be wider So in the example below I would like the 3rd li Header text 3 to extend to show all its text and it would probably need to wrap onto the next row to show this So it would need to switch to 2 rows of 2, rather than a row of 3 and a row of 1.p  pI hope that all makes sense, any help would be great. p  pCode and Codepen below.p  pa hrefhttpcodepen.iorickideeukpenwaVoqq relnofollow titleCodepen LinkCodepen Linkap  pHTML...p  precode  ltdivgt   ltul classFlexWidgetsNewgt   ltli classWidgetNewgt   lth1gtHeader text 1lth1gt   ltpgtLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
