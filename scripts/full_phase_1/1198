Positive 1198 pIm attempting a port of a hrefhttpgeographiclib.sourceforge.net relnofollowGeographicLiba into F.  Ideally, Id like it to be available as a PCL library, so that it can be accessed from Xamarin.  Unfortunately, the MathNet.Numerics and MathNet.Numerics.FSharp packages are not compatible with PCL.p  pMy first stumbling block are the absence of the hyperbolic trig function codeTrig.Atanhcode, and of a representation of codePrecision.MachineEpsiloncode, from the standard numerical libraries.  I have searched online, but drawn a blank for the most efficient way to implement these.p  pIs there a straightforward way to find the optimal implementation of these functionsp

Positive 1198 pIm currently playing around with using a hrefhttpsgithub.compicoeEto relnofollowEto.Formsa from F. One minor annoyance Ive run into is that when you define your GUI objects Forms, Panels, Buttons, etc in external files XAML or JSON and declare event handlers, those event handlers have to have a specific typep  precodemember public this.OnFirstButtonClicked senderObject, eEventArgs gt     MessageBox.Showthis, First button was clicked     gt ignore member public this.OnSecondButtonClicked senderObject, eEventArgs gt     MessageBox.Showthis, Second button was clicked     gt ignore codepre  pThe repetition of the type signatures is bothering me. Theres actually a lot of repetition in these two functions, like the calls to MessageBox with barelyvarying parameters, but this is just a test project.

Negative 1198 pI wanted to emulate a popular flash game, Chrontron, in C and needed some help getting started. NOTE Not for release, just practicing for myselfp  pre Basics Player has a time machine. On each iteration of using the time machine, a parallel state is created, coexisting with a previous state. One of the states must complete all the objectives of the level before ending the stage. In addition, all the stages must be able to end the stage normally, without causing a state paradox wherein they should have been able to finish the stage normally but, due to the interactions of another state, were not. pre  pSo, that sort of explains how the game works. You should play it a bit to really  understand what my problem is. br p  pIm thinking a good way to solve this would be to use linked lists to store each state, which will probably either be a hash map, based on time, or a linked list that iterates based on time.

This may be purely inmemory, or it may be filebacked shared memory.  PLEASE correct me if thats a misstatementp  pAmong other uses, a hrefhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.2modmod5Fstatus.html relnofollowmodstatusa lets you query a special path on a properlyconfigured server, receiving back a dynamicallygenerated page with a humanreadable breakdown of Apaches overall functioning  uptime, request count, aggregate data transfer size, and processthread status.  VERY useful information for monitoring perforamnce, or troubleshooting running servers that cant be shut down for debugging.p  pBut what if you need the Apache status, but you cant open an HTTP connection to the server  My organization sees this case from time to time. For example, the Slowloris attack.  What are some different ways that we can get the scoreboard statistics, and is there a Python interface for any of those methodsp  pNote that a Perl module, a hrefhttpsearch.cpan.orgperldocApacheScoreboard relnofollowApacheScoreboarda, appears to be able to do this.  But Im not at all sure whether it can reach a local servers stats directly shared memory, with or without a backing file, or whether it has to make a TCP connection to the localhost interface.  So Im not even sure whether this Perl module can do what were asking.  Beyond that, Id like to avoid Perl in the solution for independent organizational reasons no offense, Perl guys.p  pAlso, if people are using a completely different method to grab these statistics, I would be interested in learning about it.p

Negative 1198 pWe have a currently InnoDB table which contains roughly 500,000 rows.  This represents a queue of tasks to run.  It is stored in a MySQL database.p  pAn a continual basis, at least once per second but sometimes more frequently, we select data from it and subsequently update some rows.  Once per day, we prune old rows from the table.p  pWe started getting deadlocks on the table and this brought our task processing to a standstill.  These deadlocks were caused during the nightly prune run.  The combination of DELETE, SELECT, and UPDATE meant that essentially nothing productive could happen.  I unfortunately do not have the output of a SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS.p  pId like to know the best option for dealing with this.  Note that our code detects deadlocks and reissues the query.  Also, we long ago discovered that deleting all matching rows at once was too taxing on a database table that saw a lot of activity, so we LIMIT our deletes to 10,000 rows at a time and keep on reissuing the query until all necessary rows have been pruned.p  pI see the following options, and would like opinions on which are the best, or suggestions for other optionsp  ol liDELETE fewer rows at a timeli liUse exponential backoff on our DELETEs, though I am concerned that this will not help given our specific workloadli liLOCK TABLES as per a hrefhttpdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.0eninnodbdeadlocks.htmlMySQL documentationa.  We could probably accept blocking the SELECT and UPDATE statements for the duration of the deletes.li liSwitch to MyISAM table type.  We went with InnoDB because we were initially using transactions on this table.  This is no longer the case.  Im not enough familiar with the specifics to know if this is a viable solution.li liPerhaps use UPDATE LOWPRIORITY.  May be that the DELETEs do not affect the SELECTs, only the UPDATEs, and this may be sufficient.li ol

If DNSSD.resolve is unable to resolve the service, ti calls operationFailed method of the above mentioned object.pli ol  pHere is the codep  precodeDNSSD.resolve0, ifIndex, serviceName, regType, domain, new ResolveListener                 public void serviceResolvedDNSSDService resolver, int flags, int ifIndex,                 String fullname, String hostname, int port, TXTRecord txtRecord                     InetAddress theAddress                     try                          theAddress  InetAddress.getByNamehostname                      catch UnknownHostException e                           ouch..                                                        public void operationFailedDNSSDService arg0, int arg1                       ouch, again                               codepre  pWould it be not simpler to organize the code in the following way.p  ol lipWe call DNSSD.resolve method with information about the service we want to resolve. pli lipWe do not pass any object to the DNSSD.resolve.pli lipDNSSD.resolve do not call any method of any class.pli lipDNSSD.resolve tries to resolve a given service and, in the case it was able to do it, DNSSD.resolve returns true.

Negative 1198 pIm having some trouble figuring out the bestDjangoic way to do this. Im creating something like an interactive textbook. It has modules, which are more or less like chapters. Each module page needs to list the topics in that module, grouped into sections.p  pMy question is how I can ensure that they list in the correct order in the template Specificallyp  p1 How to ensure the sections appear in the correct orderbr 2 How to ensure the topics appear in the correct order in the sectionp  pI imagine I could add a field to each model purely for the sake of ordering, but the problem with that is that a topic might appear in different modules, and in whatever section they are in there they would again have to be ordered somehow. p  pI would probably give up and do it all manually were it not for the fact that I need to have the Topic as object in the template or view so I can mark it up according to how the user has labeled it. p  pSo I suppose my question is really to do with whether I should create the contents pages manually, or whether there is a way of ordering the query results in a way I havent thought of. Thanks for your helpp  pedit The simplest thing I can think of would be if I could have an ordered list of topics in the module or section model, but afaik thats not possible. Is it Perhaps with a custom field p

Negative 1198 pIm looking for a framework open source for distributed computing for .Net  Mono that is not simply taskbased but supports persistence of distributed tasks.p  pThe project at hand is a complex system simulation which needs to be distributed into smaller independent subsimulations. These subsimulations will keep running for a long time and will at intervals receive and send back data to the Master where a View with aggregate results is being updated and presented to the user. p  pSo the work to be distributed the subsimulations is stateful and should remain in existence on or offline at the Workers for a long time, across multiple sessions. This will require local persistent storage serialization by the Worker the subsimulations are quite large and it will not be efficient to send them back and forth to the Master for every session.p  pThe framework should offer transparency as to the actual underlying network or cloud platform that is being used by allowing different implementations to be used i.e. local cluster, Internet, single machine, 3rd party cloud platforms.p  pIt would be nice if at the modelsimulation level, performance could be tuned depending on network latency for instance by adjusting the frequency and granularity of data that is being sent between Workers and Master.p  pI looked at NGrid but this seems unfinished and dated. I also looked at some of the other usual suspects MPAPI, MPI.NET, Alchemi, etc. but as far as I can tell these dont meet the requirements. If no such framework exists, Im interested in tips on the design of such a framework.p

Negative 1198 pI have a WAR file that uses jrubycomplete.1.5.2.jar to provide JRuby as a ScriptEngine.  My JRuby script relies on some Ruby gems that I packaged in a jar file.  This works fine when I run the WAR file under Tomcat, but it does NOT work when I use JBoss 5.1.0.p  pTo trouble shoot, I even tried running a simple script that required the rake rubygem that comes packaged in thh jrubycomplete1.5.2.jar file.  This does NOT work under JBoss either.  It seems that no rubygems can be found when running under JBoss.  There must be some setting Im not getting correct for JBoss.  Should I set the Ruby loadpath to some classpath in my WAR  Some one must have done this for JBoss.  It works fine with stand alone Tomcat, so there must be something Im not doing for JBoss and its embedded Tomcat server.  p  pSorry for the newbie question, but your help would be truly appreciated. To work around this, I customized the jrubcomplete1.5.2.jar file and placed the RubyGems into the JRuby loadpath of the jar file i.e. classpathMETAINFjruby.homelibrubysiteruby1.8.  That works on JBoss, but I would rather NOT do this and have the RubyGems mechanism work on both stand alone Tomcat and JBoss.  Thanks for your help.p

Negative 1198 pI already have a CI build running on my Tfs2010 instance, but Id like to get a Gated checkin build running as well. There are subtle differences between the ways I would like these two builds would run, however. Specifically, Id like the Gated checkin to not produce bug workitems on failure, not associate changesets and workitems on build, not move builds to the drop, and not maintain previous builds. Since builds initiated by Gated checkins are uncommitted changes, these steps seem unnecessary to me, but I would definitely like the CI build to perform these functions.p  pUnfortunately, theres this strongNOCIstrong thing that appears on my changesets after theyre committed by the Gated Checkin build, and the CI build is never triggered. I found a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUStfsbuildthreadcff735c5403a48edbd5c5cbb26a0c089this threada that seemed to indicate that my DefaultTemplate.xaml should have a Get Activity NOCIOption parameter in there somewhere however nothing in the configuration file seems to indicate anything of the sort. Neither string is present, and I cant find any reference documentation in the msdn library.p  pIn fact, in the msdn library, theres a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms400688.aspxa pagea that seems to link to the page I want, however where the link would actually be theres a misplaced, duplicate link to Control where the build system places your binaries. You can see the identical link directly below it.p  pAnyhow how is the NOCIOption parameter used in the build template files Where is it placed Has no anyone else ever wanted to do this beforep  pSide note is it bad practice to crosspost between SO and the MSDN forumsp

Negative 1198 pMy app. is in C 3.5 and MySQL 5.1. It is a Windows based standalone application. It is running successfully since last two years except few issues and that too were later found out to be MySQL bugs. The bug disturbed the realtime reports as it store the same timestamp in two rows.p  pI dont know whether MySQL fixed it or not so I want to get rid of this. Now the options arep  pSQL Server 20052008 Express, Oracle 10g Express, DB2 9.2 Express, PostgreSQL, MS Access or SQLite.p  pStarting with the obvious choices MS Access amp SQLite. The problem with MS Access is that the MDB gets corrupted is a sudden power failure occurs and the file is not repairable. This happened with us on a production DB.p  pThe problem with SQLite is that its GUI still doesnt have rich query browser and also you cannot create composite keys through GUI. Secondly, I never used it and cant take chance. I dont know how many constraints it supports.p  pComing to the rest. SQL Server is good, but people here at SO said that it has its own set of bugs. Also it limits database size. Oracle, even though Express Edition, needs sooner or later a DBA, if something goes wrong.p  pI have not used IBM DB2 but people say that it is a very robust database and its GUI is feature rich. Apart from that it is very easy to manage and has no size limits. Same is true with PostgreSQL, but GUI not so feature rich, however it is sufficient. I dont know how its licensing works. The other problem is that its .NET connector is not fast. It works slow as compared to its ODBC connector.p  pYour valuable insights and recommendations are welcome.p
Negative 1198 pIm trying to figure out what the recommended practice is for the following situation. Certain objects, such as CLLocationManager or MKReverseGeocoder, send their results asynchronously to a delegate callback method. Is it OK to release that CLLocationManager or MKReverseGeocoder instance or whatever class it may be in the callback method The point is that you no longer need that object around, so you tell it to stop sending updates, set its delegate to nil, and release the object.p  pPseudo codep  precodeinterface SomeClass ltCLLocationManagerDelegategt ... end  implementation SomeClass  ...   voidsomeMethod      CLLocationManager locManager  [[CLLocationManager alloc] init]     locManager.delegate  self     [locManager startUpdatingLocation]    voidlocationManagerCLLocationManager manager didUpdateToLocationCLLocation newLocation fromLocationCLLocation oldLocation       Do something with the location      ...      [manager stopUpdatingLocation]     manager.delegate  nil     [manager release]   end codepre  pI am wondering if this usage pattern is considered to be always OK, if its considered to be never OK, or if it depends on the classp  pThere is an obvious case where releasing the delegating object would go wrong and that is if it needs to do stuff after it has notified the delegate. If the delegate releases the object, its memory may get overwritten and the application crashes. That appears to be what happens in my app with CLLocationManager in a particular circumstance, both only on the simulator. Im trying to figure out if it is a simulator bug or if what I am doing is fundamentally flawed.p  pI have been searching and I cannot find a conclusive answer to this. Does anyone have an authoritative source that can answer this questionp

Negative 1198 pIm having a lot of trouble figuring out how to do this. I need an arbitrary precision library for math in C. Im good with either CLN or PARIGP, both of which Ive installed.

Negative 1198 pIve run into what i belive could be a major issue for my code design and i was hoping someone here could explain to me how i would work around the issue.p  pI have 2 classes which each have a property of the other class creating a circular reference. I plan on serializing these classes and using XSLT to format the output but im assuming this will fail due to the circular reference.p  pExamplep  precodepublic class Book    public BookShop TheShop  new BookShop  public class BookShop    listltBookgt Books  new listltBookgt  codepre  pSo from this example each book will be in a bookShop and each bookshop will have many books. If i serialize the bookshop it will then serialize each book which then serialize a bookshop and so on round and round.  How should i handle thisp

Negative 1198 pMost of the time, my image picker works perfectly iOS 4.2.1.  However, if I scroll very rapidly up and down about 46 times through my camera roll of about 300 photos, I get a crash.

Negative 1198 pI have a .NET application written in C .NET 4.0. In this application, we have to read a large dataset from a file and display the contents in a gridlike structure. So, to accomplish this, I placed a DataGridView on the form. It has 3 columns, all column data comes from the file. Initially, the file had about 600.000 records, corresponding to 600.000 lines in the DataGridView.p  pI quickly found out that, DataGridView collapses with such a large dataset, so I had switch to Virtual Mode. To accomplish this, I first read the file completely into 3 different arrays corresponding to 3 columns, and then the CellValueNeeded event fires, I supply the correct values from the arrays.p  pHowever, there can be a huge HUGE number of records in this file, as we quickly found out. When the record size is very large, reading all the data into an array or a Listlt, etc, appears to not be feasible. We quickly run into memory allocation errors. Out of memory exception.p  pWe got stuck there, but then realized, why read the data all into arrays first, why not read the file on demand as CellValueNeeded event fires So thats what we do now We open the file, but do not read anything, and as CellValueNeeded events fire, we first Seek to the correct position in the file, and then read the corresponding data.p  pThis is the best we could come up with, but, first of all this is quite slow, which makes the application sluggish and not user friendly. Second, we cant help but think that there must be a better way to accomplish this. For example, some binary editors like HXD are blindingly fast for any file size, so Id like know how this can be achieved.p  pOh, and to add to our problems, in virtual mode of the DataGridView, when we set the RowCount to the available number of rows in the file say 16.000.000, it takes a while for the DataGridView to even initialize itself. Any comments for this problem would be appreciated as well.p  pThanksp

Negative 1198 pIve created an app with external settings in the Settings Bundle. Everything works perfectly. I save the data on every user interaction, and read the data on every view switch using viewDidAppear trigger. p  pThe issue comes when the user exits the application, then goes to Settings, changes a setting, and then relaunches the application. With iOS4, as far as I can tell, the app never really quits, it just goes into the background.

Negative 1198 pIve written a program that uses three serial ports two serial ports are on one USB  serial connector, the other serial port is on its own USB  serial connector.  When Im running the program, every 5 seconds or so, my computer stops responding, as if the kernel is busy doing something.  Im not writing any files, so its not flushing to disk, and Im not running out of memory, so its not swapping.  What else could it be  could it be flushing the serial port or something  That would be weird, because I wait for a response from the serial ports before I write the next bit of data to them.p  pIt happens less if I dont use the last serial port the one on its own USB port.p  pMore infop  ul lidebian lenny also tried squeezeli lilinux 2.6.262686 also tried 2.6.325686li linot using ftdisio, using libftd2xx1.0.2 also tried 1.0.4li ul

Its fine when playing normally but when adding pausing, seeking and accounting for occasional 6 second pauses while my external hard drive spins up it becomes an absolute nightmare.p  pIve partly implemented something already but its nowhere near perfect  you can seek around a few times but after a while it still drifts off.p  pI cant help thinking this is a common use case of Xuggler and someone must have done this sort of thing already much better than I have. But alas, I cant find any examples beyond the ones on the website. Is there a higher level API around that manages all the audio  video sync issues and just provides some higher level controls play, pause, stop etc. Ive no problem going down the route of doing it myself if theres nothing out there already, but Ive never been a fan of reinventing the wheel especially if my new wheel is in all likelihood worse than the old onep

Negative 1198 pI wanted to use a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsfundamentalsfragments.html relnofollowFragmentsa for displaying different activities on one screen on a tablet, but realised that my tablets API level is only 8 while Fragments require API level 11. p  pMy question is thus, what was used before Fragments were introducedp  pMy assumption is that each activity was simply displayed on its own screen and one navigated from one activity to the next by means of the menu button, context menus and back button. p  pThis is what I wanted to achieve using fragments I write information about three actions to three different xml files. My idea was to display the three different xml files in three different fragments on the tablets screen. The one file is information about a patient, the second file is x, y and z values received from an accelerometer and the third file is observations recorded by a therapist. I wanted to display the patients info on the left like a left bar, a graph showing the patients test results on the right and below that, the therapists observations. p  pIs there a way that I can display these three xml files info on one screen of the tablet Or am I doomed to the use of menu buttons and three different screens  one for displaying each xml filep  pComments will be appreciated.p

Negative 1198 pI am using VB.Net 2010 and am working on my final project for my intro to programming class..  My question is that my group has imported a group of file names to a listbox.  They are names of movies that were imported from an array that holds all the info in the text files i.e. number of lines, price, description of movie, etc.  When we click on the items in the listBox, we want to display different pieces of text from the original imported file into different labels on the form i.e. click on The Ref in the listBox and specific lines of text from TheRef.mmf gets displayed where we want it.  We also have a picture file name as the last line of every file ex. TheRef.jpg  We want to grab this last line which is the name of the jpg and dump it into a variable that will search through a parallel array of all the picture files and display the appropriate jpg in a picture box.

At this point the activity stream is replaced by another stream which shows your friends activity in relation to the businesss page in my case, a single entry.p  pFor me this behavior is undesirable and breaks the functionality of the news stream.

Negative 1198 pI have spent many hours debugging, and scouring the internet for a solution to this unusual problem.  Heres the dealp  pI am working on a Work Order Submission and Tracking system.  There are two databases involvedp  ol liThe database where the submissions data gets posted, which is located on the same physical machine, but on a separate virtual machine as the webserver serving the php.  They are on the same class C subnet.li liThe database of our tracking system.  Located on a different physical server on a different IP altogether, also a virtual machine.li ol  pOur work order system allows for multiple services requested, stored in an array.  In our sumbissions database, this is stored as a comma separated string, i.e. 40,60,70 but in our tracking system database, each service requested needs a separate entry, as to allow the different aspects of the project to be tracked and completed at different times, by different staff.p  pTHE PROBLEM IS  When I place my second insert statement, the one destined for the tracking database, in a for loop, it completely hangs, and takes maybe 5 to 15 minutes, before it passes that point in the code, and sends the confirmation email.  The data does not get inserted either.p  pWhen I take it out of the for loop and simply do one insert in the submissions database and one insert into the tracking system, it works fine.  p  pFirst, Ill post the code that works, but only posts one service to the tracking systemp  precode public function insertOrder      services  implode ,, thisgtmodelgtchk      curdate  thisgtmodelgtgetMySQLDate thisgtmodelgtcurdate      dueDate  thisgtmodelgtgetMySQLDate thisgtmodelgtdueDate       sql  INSERT INTO orders VALUESDEFAULT,             thisgtsanitizeservices,             thisgtsanitizecurdate,             thisgtsanitizethisgtmodelgtsubmittedBy,             thisgtsanitizethisgtmodelgtshortDesc,             thisgtsanitizethisgtmodelgtprojDetails,             thisgtsanitizedueDate,             thisgtsanitizethisgtmodelgtdueDateNotes,             thisgtsanitize thisgtmodelgtapproveBy,             thisgtsanitize thisgtmodelgtcost        thisgtexecute sql       thisgtconvertServicesToTracks     notes  thisgtmodelgtgetTracksNotes     dueDate  dueDate. 120000     shortDescNoQuotes  strreplace,,thisgtmodelgtshortDesc      sqlTracks  INSERT INTO todos VALUESDEFAULT,             thisgtsanitizeTracksthisgtmodelgtchk[0],             NULL,             thisgtsanitizeTracksshortDescNoQuotes,             thisgtsanitizeTracksnotes,             now,             thisgtsanitizeTracksdueDate,             NULL,             12,             NULL,             active,             NULL,             now       echo sqlTracks      thisgtexecuteTracks sqlTacks      private function executeTracks sql       db  thisgtgetTracksDB        thisgtcheck4Error db, sql       return result   private function getTracksDB      if thisgttracksdb thisgttracksdb  new mysqliAbstractSQLTRACKSHOST, AbstractSQLUSER, AbstractSQLPASS, AbstractSQLTRACKSSCHEMA     return thisgttracksdb   private function convertServicesToTracks     converts submission data to tracking system data     private function sanitizeTracksarg      if issetarg return NULL     if isnumericarg ampamp isdouble arg  return arg     return thisgtgetTracksDBgtescapestringarg  codepre  pWhen I add this simple for loop around the second INSERT statement, it hangs, even if the array only has one itemp  precode    fori  0 i lt countthisgtmodelgtchk i              sqlTracks  INSERT INTO todos VALUESDEFAULT,             thisgtsanitizeTracksthisgtmodelgtchk[i],             NULL,             thisgtsanitizeTracksshortDescNoQuotes,             thisgtsanitizeTracksnotes,             now,             thisgtsanitizeTracksdueDate,             NULL,             12,             NULL,             active,             NULL,             now       echo sqlTracks      thisgtexecuteTracks sqlTacks       codepre  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 1198 pI need to increment an integer in a SQL Server 2008 column.  p  pSounds like I should use an codeIDENTITYcode column, but I need to increment separate counters for each of my customers. Think of an ecommerce site where each customer gets their own incrementing order number, starting with 1. The values must be unique per customer. p  pFor example,p  precodeCustomer1  Order s 1,2,3,4,5... Customer2  Order s 1,2,3,4,5... codepre  pEssentially, I will need to manually do the work of SQLs codeidentitycode function since the number of customers is unlimited and I need codeorder code counters for each of them.   p  pI am quite comfortable doingp  precodeBEGIN TRANSACTION   SELECT NewOrderNumber  MAXOrderNumber1 From Orders where CustomerIDID   INSERT INTO ORDERS VALUES NewOrderNumber, other order columns here COMMIT TRANSACTION codepre  pMy problem is locking and concurrency concerns and assuring a unique value. It seems we need to lock with codeTABLOCKXcode. But this is a high volume database and I cant just lock the whole codeOrderscode table every time I need to do a codeSELECT MAX1code process and insert a new order record. p  pBut, if I dont lock the whole table, then I might not get a unique value for that customer.  Because some of our order entry is done afterthefact in batches by a multithreaded Windows process, it is possible that 2 operations will be simultaneously wanting to insert a new order for the same customer.p  pSo what locking methodology or technique will avoid deadlocks and still let me maintain unique incrementing order numbers PER customerp

Negative 1198 pFor example, I have a table of bank users user id, user name, and a table for transactions user id, account id, amount.br Accounts have the same properties across different users, but hold different amounts like Alex  Grocery, it is specific to Alex, but all other users also have Grocery account.p  pThe question is, would it be better to create a separate table of accounts account id, user id, amount left or to get this value by selecting all transactions with the needed user id and account id and just summing the amount values It seems that the first approach would be faster, but more prone to error and database corruption  I would need to update accounts every time the transaction happens.

Now, this all works very nice with javascript jQuery, but my problem is how to validate the unused fields in the form. p  pTo put it simple I have i.e. 7 form fileds, 3 of them are always mandatory event type, datetime etc, while the other depend on the state of the checkbox new location if newlocation is checked validate the location etc fields, and ignore the rest allow them to be empty, otherwisw ignore the location fields and validate the rest.p  precodeclass EventFormModelForm      area  forms.ModelChoiceField         querysetArea.objects.orderbyname.all,         emptylabeluPlease pick an area,         labeluArea,         errormessagesrequireduThe area is mandatory      type  forms.ModelChoiceField         querysetSportType.objects.all,         emptylabelNone,         errormessagesrequiredPlease pick a sport type,         labeluSport      shown only if newlocation is unchecked  jQuery     location  forms.ModelChoiceField         querysetLocation.objects.orderbyarea.all,         emptylabeluPick a location,         errormessagesrequiredPlease pick a location,         labeluLocation      trigger jQuery  hideshow new location field     newlocation  forms.BooleanField         requiredFalse,         label  uInsert new location                   address  forms.CharField         labeluLocatio address,         widgetforms.TextInputattrssize30,         errormessagesrequired The address is required      locationdescription  forms.CharField         labeluBrief location description,         widgetforms.Textareaattrssize10,         errormessagesrequired Location description is mandatory      class Meta         model  Event         fields               type,             newlocation,             area,             location,             address,             locationdescription,             description,          codepre
Negative 1198 pI am rather new to java, in fact this is my first program. I seem to be having a problem with generating a jar file for my java program. It is a very basic program that merely grabs data from a website, then displays it in a gui. The program is dependent on Jsoup and HtmlCleaner. The gui was made with JFormDesigner. p  pGetting back to the problem, when I run the program using eclipse everything runs perfectly. No issues whatsoever. However, when I run it as an exported jar or a jar made with Jar Maker, the GUI doesnt even show up. The strange thing is that when I run it with a code.batcode file, the GUI displays, but the program doesnt do what it is suppose to do.p  pI am really stuck, I am not sure what to try next.

Negative 1198 pUsing Entity Framework 4.3.1 CodeFirst and having no luck getting the migrations or scripts to respect the schema that I want my tables to end up in.  p  pIt seems the default behavior the one that Im seeing regardless of what I do is to omit the schema completely from the SQL that actually runs causes tables to be created in the default schema for the user running the migration or script.  p  pMy DBAs are telling me that they cannot change my default schema due to the fact that Im part of an AD group and not a local user, so changing the default schema for the user running an often recommended workaround the script is not an option at all.p  pIve tried using the annotations like thisp  precode[TableMyTable, Schema  dbo] public class MyTable      public int Id  get set       public string MyProp1  get set       public string MyProp2  get set   codepre  pAnd Ive also tried using the fluent variant of the same thingp  precodemodelBuilder.EntityltYourTypegt.ToTableMyTable, dbo codepre  pThe resultant script and migrations ignore the fact that I tried to specify a schema.

Negative 1198 pi have searched the whole internetz for this question, and its a damn hard one to search for as its rather complicated. Try searching for Fluent NHibernate Many to Many with a bridge table with extra columns etc...p  pOkay, to make it easier to explain ill define some tables i can refer to. Table User, Table Function, Table UserHasFunction.p  pOne User can have many Functions, and a Function can have many Users, this is linked in the bridge table UserHasFunction. The bridge table has extra columns which is only relevant to the relationship.p  pWell anyways iv found that FNH doesnt have any automatic solution to this, basically you have to use a one to many relation from User to UserHasFunction and many to one from UserHasFunction to Function, hence [One] to [Many  Many] to [One].p  pI have solved it like in this link a hrefhttpsessionfactory.blogspot.com201012manytomanyrelationshipswith.html relnofollowhttpsessionfactory.blogspot.com201012manytomanyrelationshipswith.htmla just with FNH class mapping instead of xml obviously.p  pBut im not satisfied with the solution, do i really have to do all this manually work to make this function properly Also as it is now it inserts duplicates in the bridge table.p  pIn my head im doing something wrong, cause i cant imagine there is no support for this.

Negative 1198 pI have a map where at some point I draw around 14000 markers. If the bounds of the map is set to the entire area where the markers are drawn, it takes a long time to draw the markers about 8 seconds. But if I zoom into an area where fewno markers will be drawn, then drawing the 14000 markers goes really fast, like 23 seconds.p  pI assume this is because the most time consuming process is to actually draw the marker icons to the tiles, and since the markers are added one at a time, the map is rendered a ton of times in a very short time span.p  pTherefore I wonder if its possible to disable the map updatingrendering while I add my icons, then reenable it when all the icons are added.p  pAny solutions with the similar effect is welcomep

Negative 1198 pThe following class acts as a simple cache that gets updated very infrequently say e.g. twice a day and gets read quite a lot up to several times a second.

Negative 1198 pI have two columns A and B, and would like to get a list of itemsand their counts in column B grouped by items in column A, and create a new table with the information.

If concatenating item and count is not possible, I could also have one column with a list of items and another column with a list of counts separated by a delimiter.p  pI can do this in Java by first getting all the items and storing them in a map with count updates, and then update the new table, but I was wondering if theres any way to do this in PostgreSQL perhaps by writing a function.p  pIve looked at array function in PostgreSQL but didnt get far.

Negative 1198 pI am starting to learn php, I made a form that uses a php file to write the information into an xml file. The form is in an html file, and the php action in a seperate file.

Negative 1198 pI am using NSCoding to save and restore my view controllers. However Im saving to disk the navigation stack  view controllers every time a view controller is pushed or popped.p  pThis is not energy efficient, and theres a better way.p  pThink of codeNSUserDefaultscode. It saves the changes somewhere in memory and if called repeatedly as it is, just overwrite and when the codesynchronizecode method is called it writes them to disk. This is genuinely done, and is super energy efficient.p  pSo can I implement something like this On every call to save changes somewhere in memory and when a codesynchronizewriteToDiskcode method is called to purge the memory cache and write them to disk. Any ideas will be greatly appreciatedp  pMy idea is to use codeNSCachecode, and in codeapplicationwillResignActivecode or codeapplicationwillTerminatecode to get the object in the cache and write it do disk.p  pThanks so muchp

Negative 1198 pI am having an annoying problem with organising my sources. We have a client server application with the server written in java and android as the client. The repository contains all the server files in one folder and all the android specific stuff in another at the top level.The Android folder however is not complete since it needs some files that exist in the server folder. I need a way to pull down the all the necessary files from 2 separate folders in my repo all in to one Intellij moduleproject.p  pMy colleagues using eclipse were able to solve this by creating an android project, downloading the android source files from the repo and then using the add to build path  link source feature.

Anyway, if there is a reference where this has been done successfully already, this thread can be closed with a link to that reference of course. p  pSo far here is my first approachp  pstrongapplicationcontextsecurity.xmlstrongp  precodelthttp autoconfigfalse useexpressionstrue entrypointrefcustomAuthenticationEntryPointgt     ltintercepturl patternApplicationScaffold.html accesspermitAll gt     ltintercepturl pattern accesshasRoleROLEUSER gt lthttpgt  ltbeansbean idcustomAuthenticationEntryPoint classorg.springframework.security.web.authentication.LoginUrlAuthenticationEntryPoint      cloginFormUrlApplicationScaffold.html gt  lt Configure Authentication mechanism gt ltauthenticationmanager aliasauthenticationManagergt     ltauthenticationprovidergt         ...     ltauthenticationprovidergt ltauthenticationmanagergt codepre  pemApplicationScaffold.htmlem my application was created with Spring Roo is my starting page containing the GWT login page. p  pstrongweb.xmlstrongp  precodeltdisplaynamegtsecuritytestltdisplaynamegt  ltdescriptiongtRoo generated applicationltdescriptiongt  lt Enable escaping of form submission contents gt ltcontextparamgt     ltparamnamegtdefaultHtmlEscapeltparamnamegt     ltparamvaluegttrueltparamvaluegt ltcontextparamgt  ltcontextparamgt     ltparamnamegtcontextConfigLocationltparamnamegt     ltparamvaluegtclasspathMETAINFspringapplicationContext.xmlltparamvaluegt ltcontextparamgt  ltfiltergt     ltfilternamegtCharacterEncodingFilterltfilternamegt     ltfilterclassgtorg.springframework.web.filter.CharacterEncodingFilterltfilterclassgt     ltinitparamgt         ltparamnamegtencodingltparamnamegt         ltparamvaluegtUTF8ltparamvaluegt     ltinitparamgt     ltinitparamgt         ltparamnamegtforceEncodingltparamnamegt         ltparamvaluegttrueltparamvaluegt     ltinitparamgt ltfiltergt  ltfiltergt     ltfilternamegtHttpMethodFilterltfilternamegt     ltfilterclassgtorg.springframework.web.filter.HiddenHttpMethodFilterltfilterclassgt ltfiltergt  ltfiltergt     ltfilternamegtspringSecurityFilterChainltfilternamegt     ltfilterclassgtorg.springframework.web.filter.DelegatingFilterProxyltfilterclassgt ltfiltergt  ltfiltergt     ltfilternamegtSpring OpenEntityManagerInViewFilterltfilternamegt     ltfilterclassgtorg.springframework.orm.jpa.support.OpenEntityManagerInViewFilterltfilterclassgt ltfiltergt ltfiltermappinggt     ltfilternamegtCharacterEncodingFilterltfilternamegt     lturlpatterngtlturlpatterngt ltfiltermappinggt  ltfiltermappinggt     ltfilternamegtHttpMethodFilterltfilternamegt     lturlpatterngtlturlpatterngt ltfiltermappinggt  ltfiltermappinggt     ltfilternamegtspringSecurityFilterChainltfilternamegt     lturlpatterngtlturlpatterngt ltfiltermappinggt  ltfiltermappinggt     ltfilternamegtSpring OpenEntityManagerInViewFilterltfilternamegt     lturlpatterngtlturlpatterngt ltfiltermappinggt  lt Creates the Spring Container shared by all Servlets and Filters gt ltlistenergt     ltlistenerclassgtorg.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListenerltlistenerclassgt ltlistenergt  lt Handles Spring requests gt ltservletgt     ltservletnamegtsecuritytestltservletnamegt     ltservletclassgtorg.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServletltservletclassgt     ltinitparamgt         ltparamnamegtcontextConfigLocationltparamnamegt         ltparamvaluegtWEBINFspringwebmvcconfig.xmlltparamvaluegt     ltinitparamgt     ltloadonstartupgt1ltloadonstartupgt ltservletgt  ltservletgt     ltservletnamegtrequestFactoryltservletnamegt     ltservletclassgtcom.securitytest.server.CustomRequestFactoryServletltservletclassgt ltservletgt  ltservletmappinggt     ltservletnamegtsecuritytestltservletnamegt     lturlpatterngtlturlpatterngt ltservletmappinggt  ltservletmappinggt     ltservletnamegtrequestFactoryltservletnamegt     lturlpatterngtgwtRequestlturlpatterngt ltservletmappinggt  ltsessionconfiggt     ltsessiontimeoutgt10ltsessiontimeoutgt ltsessionconfiggt codepre  pp  pThe codeCustomRequestFactoryServletcode class extends codeRequestFactoryServletcode providing an additional constructor to resolve Spring services and should not be relevant to security issues. p  pAfter entering username and password on the GWT widget a login service is invoked via codeRequestFactorycode that simply does the followingp  precodepublic String loginUserString username, String password      UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken token               new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationTokenusername, password      Authentication authenticatedUser  authenticationManager.authenticatetoken     SecurityContextHolder.getContext.setAuthenticationauthenticatedUser      return username   codepre  pSo when I enter a URL like ..emfoooooooem I expect my application to redirect me to the login page emApplicationScaffold.htmlem.

Negative 1198 pI have a C WinForm that has a lot of lookup data, around 4050 different code sets needed to populate the various combo boxes. I wish I could break it up into different forms, but the data needs to be together on this one form.p  pIm using Entity Framework to model the data, so Im not sure what the best practice would be to load all these data sources. Im worried that if I load all the data sources at once, there will be a significant performance hit...so I suppose the other option would be ondemand loading loading code sets only if editing is needed, but that would add a lot of code complexity Id need to add event handlers to each combobox.p  pAlso, is it better performance wise to create Binding Sources, or just populate the Data Source directly using a LINQ query.p

Negative 1198 pI have recently encountered an issue with phpfpm processes usage As in the amount of active processes peaking to the maximum available processes and by that stopping execution of other scripts until the problematic processes finish.p  pIn a bit more detail, my current phpfpm settings arep  precodepm  static pm.maxchildren  100 codepre  pI am watching the phpfpms status page, which most of the time showsp  precodetotal processes 100 idle processes 9599 active processes 15 codepre  pwhich is normal. However, ever few minutes the active processes count jumps to 100 for a few seconds, and then goes back to normal of 15. in that time all other scripts running on the server are simply stuck for that period of time. From the browser you simply see the page waiting.p  pNow, i have checked to see if its in specific traffic spikes, but its not. it can also occur with the lowest traffic count of the day.p  pI believe that a certain script, maybe even only in specific situations, is causing php to simply use all available processes for some reason.p  pThis issue started once we moved to PHP 5.4.X from 5.2.Xp  pWe currently have around 60 websites, so its kinda hard going through each websites pages and checking it.p  pThere is nothing in the nginx logs Nothing critical anyway, there are a few Notices and such.p  pWhat im trying to do, is somehow traceprofilemonitor which phpfpm script is using the processes so i will know where to start looking for the problem.p  pIs this possible Maybe a different approachp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pHere is a graph of the PHPFPM process count in 1 hour, in 1 min intervalsp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comdWZxkZ2.png altgraphp  pI have marked in red the jumps that im talking about. The memory usage at the time of the spike stays the samep

I read a nonprime atribute is the one that cannot participate in creating a candidate key.

Negative 1198 pI am trying to write a Sencha Touch application that I can package in PhoneGap for iOS, Android etc... The app allows you to input some data which I would like to save to my backend server using PHPMySQL. It all works when I use an AJAX proxy as I am testing the app on the same server as my database.p  pHowever when I package it for mobile devices I run into the samedomain restrictions of AJAX calls. So I modified it to use the JSONP proxy and I can read the data from the server database but have no idea how to write records back. Do I need to somehow pass the data in the GET request Obviously the server side PHP needs to be different because of the callbacks and the fact JSONP is forced to used GET requests. I am also trying to get CORS working but currently no success.p  pSo my question is how would I implement writing data back to my backend server from a packaged mobile Sencha app running on a mobile device Either using JSONP if that is even possible or any other alternatives are welcomep  pMany Thanksp

Negative 1198 pI am trying to process an input character when given, clear the box, and be ready to process another.p  pThe app uses an EditBox which always has a max of 1 character.

Negative 1198 pIs there a known issue with SMTP and timing I have included some code below that basically sends a birthday greeting to someone, along with a horoscope and other people that share their birthday for fun. p  pI use Regex replace to get both elements, horoscope and other people, from other methods and insert them into the HTML document between a pair of p tags. I am positive that those methods work, and I am positive that the HTML document is being properly reformatted according to the console, which prints out my new HTML document in another test of mine. I am thinking that maybe my problem is that the email is sent off before the replacement has a chance to happen, but I could very easily be was off base.

Negative 1198 pOk so i am trying to build a battle script in php  ajax. At the moment i have a html form with the users moves and a text box  to test    i am using ajax to send the move to a parse file which then echos out which move they have picked. The problem i have is that i know how to make it so when the user submit the form the variable which stores there health go down but i do not know how to show it on the first page. So i have page1 the health is showed and the user picks a attack and then submits the ajax will send the move over to page 2 and makes the health go down but i do not know how to make the health go down on page 1 with out refreshing Even tho i make it go down when the user submits i do not know how to make it show dynamically.

Negative 1198 pI have an embedded system I have to integrate my Java application with. So far my work has been going well except now I have come across a problem where I need to send the number 160 as a bit. The OutputStream will only accept a byte[] and when I try to insert 160 hex value 0xA0 into the array it is converted to 96. I understand that Java byte only supports signed values 127 to 128, so I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar problem dealing with embedded systems and what their solution was.p  pHere is some sample codep  precodeOutputStream oStream  mmSocket.getOutputStream byte attributeCode  byte0xA0 byte[] buffer  new byte[bufferSize] buffer[command.length  1]  attributeCode oStream.writebuffer codepre  pThe embedded system is written in C and has been around for years, so no chance to have that changed.p
Negative 1198 pIm using flex amp bison to parse a custom language and Im in the situation described here a hrefhttpwww.gnu.orgsoftwarebisonmanualhtmlnodeHowCanIResettheParser.html relnofollowhttpwww.gnu.orgsoftwarebisonmanualhtmlnodeHowCanIResettheParser.htmla. To be more precisep  blockquote   pI invoke yyparse several times, and on correct input it works   properly but when a parse error is found, all the other calls fail   too. How can I reset the error flag of yyparsep blockquote  pMy parser and scanner run inside a separate thread, but there is only one thread working with the input file. In my understanding I dont need to write a reentrant scanner since there is only one thread working with the input file. In that page the problem is clearly explained but the solution is not clear to me. It saysp  blockquote   pTherefore, whenever you change yyin, you must tell the Lexgenerated   scanner to discard its current buffer and switch to the new one. This   depends upon your implementation of Lex see its documentation for   more. For Flex, it suffices to call YYFLUSHBUFFER after each   change to yyin. If your Flexgenerated scanner needs to read from   several input streams to handle features like include files, you might   consider using Flex functions like yyswitchtobuffer that   manipulate multiple input buffersp blockquote  pMy parser thread calls yyparse in order to build my AST. What is not clear to me is when and where I have to call yyflushbuffer to fix the problem. In my understanding the scanner code generated by Flex is called by the parser code generated by Bison. The Bison generated code is generated by the grammar. As a result the parser code is not under my direct control. This means I cannot include the call to yyflushbuffer into the parser code since it would be overwritten every time I generate the parser code by the grammar. It means that I should put the yyflushbuffer in the grammr file somewhere. But wherep

Negative 1198 pI have a for loop editing an array of model objects, some of which require user input and some of which do not. I would like to be able to open a second window as needed to display multiple choices to the user, receive the users selection, close the second window, and then return to the place I was in the original loop. In AppleScript, this could be done simply with a choose from list dialog. But I havent figured out how to do it in Cocoa since the NSNotificationCenter architecture requires me to process the second windows response in a different selector. Thus the loop is broken and I cant process the rest of the array. I also tried doing it with delegation to no avail. Are panels and alerts the only way to do thisp

Negative 1198 pI have access to a thirdparty JSON file that contains about 1MB of realtime information, and the file updates constantly. My website will display and update this information every few seconds. I cant have the users access the JSON directly from the source, because my access key will be revoked for excessive use. So I need to copy the JSON file to a server every few seconds, and have users get the JSON from that server.p  pHow should I get a server to do this I dont have my own server. CRON jobs can only run every minute at most. Should I have a shell script make a copy of this file every x seconds Can a shell script really run forever Maybe I should have a CRON job execute a shell scriptp  pIve also looked at cloud data hosting, but with 1MB being pulled even just every 20 seconds by each user, I could quickly go through gigabytes of data transfer, which can cost hundreds of dollars a month with these services. Unless you know of a data host thats cheaper.p

And the types are not useful enough without their XML comments anyway.p  pAlso, this only applies to parameters, but not to return types contained in the body of the HttpResponseMessage.

I could use reflection to get the types similarly to how I got the parameter types again, but I really would like the XML comments together with types, and including nested complex types.p  pI would also find it acceptable to document the modelclass documentation properties with types and XML comments separately from the service calls, and have the service calls just show the name of the type that they return then at least the user could find the documentation for that type.p  pHas anyone been able to implement something similar to what I am trying to do for either parameters or return types, preferably both Or any ideas to point me in the right directionp

Second main principle is Just remember There can be only one. Weld reference WR.p  pSo the problem appears when we start actively use polymorphism. I dont know how others do MVC but I have a lot of controllers. Besides I want to try new design and divide all application into components, each component with its controllers and actions. In ideal each component can be developed strongby independent programmersstrong. And when we use no CDI everything is ok. Each component has its controllers, and actions. For example 10 components can have SaveAction class. Its obvious that these classes are private and can be used only in their package. And here we have a big problem. We must clearly distinguish what instances of Action class from ALL classes that implement this interface we want to use. p  pFrom WRp  pTo fix anambiguous dependency, either p  blockquote   ul   liintroduce a qualifier to distinguish between the two implementations of the bean type,li   lidisable one of the beans by annotating itAlternative,  li   limove one of the implementations to a module that is not in the classpath of the  module with the injection point, orli   lidisable one of two Alternative  beans that are trying to occupy the same space, usingbeans.xml.li   ul blockquote  pHow can I follow these advices if I use dozens of action classes I tried to use producer method.

However, because they both end with ville and both begin with Bo they have a rather small Levenstein distance.p  pstrongI am looking for a string distance algorithm that takes into account the position of the character to minimize the effect of prefixes and suffixes by weighting letters in the middle of the word higher than letters at the ends of the word. strongp  pI could probably write something myself but I would find it hard to believe that no one has yet published a suitable algorithm.p

After selection is finished memory retained by app drops.pli ul  pThe other way of displaying the large text is to use the multiple textviews and assign the text to visible textview only like UITableView, but this will increase the complexity as i have to recount the number of textviews required on each textChanged delegate call of layoutManager of UItextView.p  pAny body has idea how to display large attributed text in UITextView with better performance.p  pAny guess how iPages app is working, because it display text when the area is in visible range.p

Negative 1198 pIn a java project i need to call lets say generic, utility web services. For instance giving a city code as parameter and getting details about that city.

That class had several web service call methods and all were static methods. p  pNow, i dont really want to do same thing again because i dont think thats the right way to do it hard to debug etc. I also dont want to make a different class for all these methods and make an instance for each call because they are too generic and instantiation seems like an overhead for that situation.p  pSo, alternatives comes to my mind isp  ul liUsing old method.

Negative 1198 pIm currently working on creating a ranking algorithm to rank relationships between students.  In my NxN matrix F     F[i, j] refers to the relationship between student i and student j. The higher the value, the stronger the relationship.p  pMy problem is such.  For creating a cluster of k students, I first choose the argmax of F.  If the argmax returns index i, j, I add students i and j to my cluster.  I then want to find the argmax of F along axis i and j, and take the larger of the two as the next student in my cluster.  I then repeat this process along the axis of each student in the cluster until I have k students in my cluster.p  pWhere I am confused     numpy.argmax takes a flattened axis as the argument for which axis to search through.  How do I flatten axis i and j so that I can do numpy.argmaxF, flattenedAxisp  pIm a relative beginner to Python, so this probably has an easy answer whose existence I was unaware of.

There are just a couple of exceptions I really need to handle initial database query and codeEMyOwnHTTPNotFoundErrorcode to set a flag that the offer doesnt exist. I read somewhere a suggestion not to explicitly chase for exception handling unless you really need it...p  pHowever it is very important that the thread keeps on running no matter of which exceptions are thrown insideoutside any code blocks. The idea is to completely ignore exceptions and never break either codewhile..docode loop or stop the thread. At the same time, correctly disposing resources is also a must.p  pI would be grateful for any suggestionscomments on how to improve this code.p

Negative 1198 pIm trying to solve the constrained orienteering problem in Matlab, my problem is I dont understand how to get the hessian matrix of an objective function like the one in a hrefhttpi.imgur.comDGv5a1M.png relnofollowthisa formulation specifically, ones where there are summations and variable indices. p  pFor a simple 2 node problem size, with weights 2 and 3, Ive tried writing the objective function as p  precodef  2x11  2x12  2x13  2x14  2x15  3x21  3x22  3x23  3x24  3x25 codepre  pand obtaining the hessian matrix using codehessianfcode. This outputs a matrix of 0s which makes sense since it gets the secondorder partial derivative for each element. The main reason for my confusion is when when I call codequadprogH, fcode I get an error saying H and f need to be of data type double.p  pBut Im not sure whether this is correct Can someone point me in the right direction p  pEDIT Heres the code Im using.  I did it for a 5node instance, and I did it all by hand i.e. no loops.  Its pretty terrible but Im new to Matlab and I was hoping Id get a better understanding of the algorithm itself by doing this by hand the first time aroundp  precodeCOP for 5 spots  AOI  5 M  10 fullAOI  AOIAOI  variables  cell80, 1  for i1AOI     variablesi  [w num2stri] end  varcount  AOI1 for i15     for j15         variablesvarcount  [x num2stri num2strj]         varcount  varcount  1     end end  for i15     for j15         variablesvarcount  [d num2stri num2strj]         varcount  varcount  1     end end  for i15     for j15         variablesvarcount  [f num2stri num2strj]         varcount  varcount  1     end end  varsize  sizevariables   Combine Variables Into One Vector  N  lengthvariables for v  1N     eval[variablesv,   , num2strv, ] end   Lower Bounds lb  zerossizevariables lb[f11,f12,f13,f14,f15,f21,f22,f23,f24,f25,...     f31,f32,f33,f34,f35,f41,f42,f43,f44,f45,...     f51,f52,f53,f54,f55,x11,x12,x13,x14,x15,...     x21,x22,x23,x24,x25,x31,x32,x33,x34,x35,...     x41,x42,x43,x44,x45,x51,x52,x53,x54,x55]  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,...                              0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]   Upee                         ub  Infsizevariables ub[x11,x12,x13,x14,x15,x21,x22,x23,x24,x25,...     x31,x32,x33,x34,x35,x41,x42,x43,x44,x45,...     x51,x52,x53,x54,x55,x12,x22,x32,x42,x13,...     x23,x33,x43,x14,x14,x24,x34,x44,x22,x23,...     x24,x25,x32,x33,x34,x35,x42,x43,x44,x45]  [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,...                                                  1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,...                                                  1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,...                                                  1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]   Linear Inequalities   Constraint 3 A  zeros27, 80  A1, x12  1 A2, x22  1 A3, x32  1 A4, x42  1 A5, x13  1 A6, x23  1 A7, x33  1 A8, x43  1 A9, x14  1 A10, x24  1 A11, x34  1 A12, x44  1  A13, x21  1 A14, x22  1 A15, x23  1 A16, x24  1 A17, x25  1 A18, x31  1 A19, x32  1 A20, x33  1 A21, x34  1 A22, x35  1 A23, x41  1 A24, x42  1 A25, x43  1 A26, x44  1 A27, x45  1  b  ones27, 1   Aeq  zeros77, 80 beq  zeros77, 1  Constraint 1 Aeq1, [x12, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq2, [x13, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq3, [x14, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq4, [x15, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq5, [x15, 1]  [1, 1]      Repeat from line 69 ha, may not need this Aeq6, [x25, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq7, [x35, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq8, [x45, 1]  [1, 1]   constraint 2 Aeq9, x21  1 Aeq10, x31  1 Aeq11, x41  1 Aeq12, x51  1 Aeq13, x52  1 Aeq14, x53  1 Aeq15, x54  1   constraint 4 Aeq16, [x11, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq17, [x21, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq18, [x31, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq19, [x41, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq20, [x12, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq21, [x22, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq22, [x32, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq23, [x42, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq24, [x13, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq25, [x23, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq26, [x33, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq27, [x43, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq28, [x14, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq29, [x24, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq30, [x34, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq31, [x44, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq32, [x15, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq33, [x25, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq34, [x35, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq35, [x45, 1]  [1, 1]  Aeq36, [x11, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq37, [x12, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq38, [x13, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq39, [x14, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq40, [x15, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq41, [x21, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq42, [x22, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq43, [x23, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq44, [x24, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq45, [x25, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq46, [x31, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq47, [x32, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq48, [x33, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq49, [x34, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq50, [x35, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq51, [x41, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq52, [x42, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq53, [x43, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq54, [x44, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq55, [x45, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq56, [x51, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq57, [x52, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq58, [x53, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq59, [x54, 1]  [1, 1] Aeq60, [x55, 1]  [1, 1]   Constraint 7 Aeq61, [f22, d12, x12]  [1, 1, 1] Aeq62, [f23, d22, x22]  [1, 1, 1] Aeq63, [f24, d32, x32]  [1, 1, 1] Aeq64, [f25, d42, x42]  [1, 1, 1] Aeq65, [f32, d13, x13]  [1, 1, 1] Aeq66, [f33, d23, x23]  [1, 1, 1] Aeq67, [f34, d33, x33]  [1, 1, 1] Aeq68, [f35, d43, x43]  [1, 1, 1] Aeq69, [f42, d14, x14]  [1, 1, 1] Aeq70, [f43, d24, x24]  [1, 1, 1] Aeq71, [f44, d34, x34]  [1, 1, 1] Aeq72, [f45, d44, x44]  [1, 1, 1]   Constraint 8 Aeq73, [f11, AOI, 1]  [1, 1, 1] Aeq74, [f12, AOI, 1]  [1, 1, 1] Aeq75, [f13, AOI, 1]  [1, 1, 1] Aeq76, [f14, AOI, 1]  [1, 1, 1] Aeq77, [f15, AOI, 1]  [1, 1, 1]     Objective Function  f  2x11  2x12  2x13  2x14  2x15  3x21  3x22  3x23  3x24  3x25 ...     4x31  4x32  3x33  3x34  3x35  5x41  5x42  5x43  5x44  5x45  ...     6x51  6x52  6x53  6x54  6x55  syms x11 x12 x13 x14 x15 syms x21 x22 x23 x24 x25 syms x31 x32 x33 x34 x35 syms x41 x42 x43 x44 x45 syms x51 x52 x53 x54 x55  H  hessianf opts  optimoptionsquadprog, Algorithm, activeset, Display, off  [x fval]  quadprogH, f, A, b, Aeq, beq, lb, ub codepre
Negative 1198 pI have the following problem I got an old application which is written in python. This application allows the user to specify small python steps which will be executed, python steps are basically small python scripts, I call them steps because the execution of this application involves other steps like executing something from commandline. These python steps are stored as python code in an xml file.p  pNow I want to rewrite the application by using C .NET. Is there a best practise solution to do something like thisp  pI dont want to call python as external programm and pass the actual python stepscript to the python interpreter  I want something built in. I just came across IronPython and .NET python but I am not quite sure which one to use.  I want to achieve some sort of debugging for the small scripts, that is why the call the interpreter solution is not acceptable.p  pWhat is more important is that a lot of those scripts already exist. Therefore I have to use a C implementation of python which has the same syntax as python as well as the same built in libs of python. Is this even possiblep  pThanks and Greetings Xeunp
Negative 1198 pI am writing unit tests for a controller. This controller has a resource service injected  p  precodefunction controllerscope, Service      Service.getfunctionresult          do stuff with the result, not relevant here       codepre  pThe service is defined like this  p  precodeangular.moduleso.factoryService, [resource, service] function serviceresource      return resourceurl, null,          get  method POST, params , isArray false       codepre  pMy Jasmine unit test is the following  p  precodedescribeController, function     var httpBackend      beforeEachfunction          moduleso          injectfunction httpBackend              httpBackend  httpBackend                   itshould have done stuff irrelevant to the question, function          var injector  angular.injectorso,             scope  injector.getrootScope,          httpBackend             .whenPOSTurl             .respond []           controller needs to be defined here and not in the beforeEach as there          are more parameters passed to it, depending on the test         var controller  injector.getcontrollercontroller,  scope scope           httpBackend.flush           then here the actual test resolution, also irrelevant       codepre  pI get an error when running the test  p  precodeError No pending request to flush  in filepathtoangularmock.js line 1453 codepre  pI added a console.log in the callback from Service.get and indeed, it is not called everything outside of the callback is of course called. Also tried to add a scope digest if not phased after controller creation in the unit test, as I saw suggested in an other question, with no luck. p  pI know that I can mock that in some other ways, but using httpBackend seems the perfect solution for the test  mocking the webserver and the data received. p  pIm using AngularJS 1.2.16 cant upgrade to 1.3., IE 8 compatibility required. I first used 1.2.13 and updated to check if it would solve the issue, without any luck. p

Negative 1198 pI have recently finished solving the interesting codeHackerRankcode problem titled Conways Game Of Life. The problem statement is as followsp  blockquote   pGame of Life is a cellular automaton game devised by the British Mathematician John Horton Conway. The original game is a zero player   game. The evolution of it depends entirely on its input. p      pGame of life takes place on a 2D grid. Each cell in the grid will be   in one of the two possible states,p      pALIVE DEAD The birth or death of the cells is based on the following   rules.p      pA cell switches from DEAD to ALIVE if its surrounded exactly by 3   living cells. A cell remains alive if its surrounded by 2 or 3 living   cells. A cell switches from being ALIVE to DEAD if its surrounded by   more than 3 living cells because of over population. A cell switches   from being ALIVE to DEAD if its surrounded by less than 2 cells   because of under population. Each cell is surrounded by 8 cells, 4 on   its sides and 4 on its corners. Cells at the extreme corners have only   3 neighbors and the cells at the extreme right, left, top and bottom   of the board have 5 neighboring cells. The rules mentioned above   applies for these cells as well. p      pThis version of Game of Life takes place of a 29x29 grid, the top left   cell is 0,0 and the bottom right cell is 28,28. Its indexed as   row,column like arrays in Computer Science. Two players play against   each other. What differs this game from the original is that a cell   has 2 states when its ALIVE. The two states beingp      pWHITE BLACK The first rule differs.p      pWhen a cell switches from being DEAD to ALIVE, it assumes the color of   the majority of the 3 cells. Since 3 is odd, majority always exists.   Rest of the rules follow the original version of the game.  Initially,   all the cells are in DEAD state. The first player plays WHITE and the   second player plays BLACK. Each player take turns to switch one DEAD   cell to ALIVE state. The ALIVE cell takes the color assigned to the   player. This goes on till each player has placed 40 cells of their   respective colors on the grid. The game then starts. The alive cells   of the maximum color at the end of 500 life cycles wins the gamep      pInput Formatp      pThe 1st player is represented by the character w ascii value 119 and   the 2nd player is represented by the character b ascii value 98.   First line of the input represents the character of the player. 29   lines follow. Each line has 29 characters without any spaces between   them. Alive cells are represented by their respective characters and   the dead cells are represented by  ascii value 45.p      pOutputp      pOutput is 2 single spaced integers which indicates the position the   cell which needs to be switched from DEAD to ALIVE.p blockquote  pThere is a sample input and sample output, along with more details, at the official problem site here a hrefhttpswww.hackerrank.comchallengesconway relnofollowhttpswww.hackerrank.comchallengesconwayap  pI was wondering what algorithms other hackers used. Im right now right around the bottom of the list  any other perspective would be extremely useful. p

Negative 1198 pI am having trouble understanding at a fundamental level how a one to many relationship should be managed in Entity Framework. In my application I have two tables, codeDISPLAYMASTERcode, and codeDISPLAYITEMScode. Their relationship is like sop  pDISPLAYMASTER.DISPLAYID strong1strong DISPLAYITEMS.DISPLAYIDp  pEntity Framework organizes this really intuitively. I am left with a strongly typed codeDISPLAYMASTERcode object that has an codeICollectioncode property called codeDISPLAYITEMScode.p  pMy confusion lies within how to save the codeDISPLAYITEMScode collection back to the database. In my application I am reading in all of the codeDISPLAYITEMScode for the particular codeDISPLAYMASTERcode using LINQ into a codeListltDISPLAYITEMSgtcode object called codedisplayItemscode. This is then bound to a codeDataGridcode for editing using MVVM. The user can edit existing codeDISPLAYITEMScode, delete existing codeDISPLAYITEMScode, or add new codeDISPLAYITEMScode using the codeDataGridcode. My binding works perfectly and these changes are reflected in codedisplayItemscode. Once it comes time to save is where I stop feeling confident in my code. When the user clicks save I am setting the codeDISPLAYMASTERcodes codeICollectioncode like sop  precodedisplayMaster.DISPLAYITEMS  displayItems codepre  pIs this the proper way to be working on an Entity Framework collection Or should I be binding the codeDataGridcode directly to the codedisplayMaster.DISPLAYITEMScode object Or some other method The reason I am not confident is because if I try to validate the codedisplayMaster.DISPLAYITEMScode entity usingp  precodeDbEntityValidationResult validationResults  context.EntrydisplayMaster.DISPLAYITEMS.GetValidationResult codepre  pI get an error saying List1 is not part of the collection, which obviously doesnt seem right.p  pAny advice or guidance would be appreciated.p  pThanks.p

I am terrified at the thought of handling this in the ViewModel as I have it properly decoupled right now.  Do I modify the View to contain a property that can be read during navigation to hide the region  If so where in the navigation process can I get access to the View that is activated by Unity All of my views implement an IView interface that just exposes an IVewModel as per the MSDN instruction on setting up a proper prism MVVM.

The cells that are already set are codeltinputgtcode tags like the rest, but they have the codereadonlycode attribute. Each cell has a class of puzzlecells and an id starting with a c followed directly by the row number they are in, a , and then the cell number.p  pSo, the third cell down, fifth from the left would have an id of c35. Every cell has an id, so Im thinking the inputs that are editable would have an attribute something like this codeonkeyupshiftArrowsthiscode. My question is what do I put in codeshiftArrowscodep  pIt probably would start with something likep  precodevar inputid  this.attrid codepre  pbut then I have to test if an arrow key is being pressed while the shift key is down. If codeshiftdowncode is pressed or codeshiftupcode and the cell directly above or below it is codereadonlycode, then it would go to the right one and check it again. If that is codereadonlycode, it would go to the left two, and would keep checking like that. if codeshiftrightcode is pressed it would keep going to the right until if finds an empty one, or jump to the next line if it has to. Same thing for codeshiftleftcode.p  pAnyway, I could probably do that, but what I dont know is how to test if a arrow is pressed while the shift key is held down.p

Negative 1198 pIve recently stopped using winzip self extractors with my install4j installer, in favor of packing all my resources inside the install4j installer. The problem I am attempting to solve is that winzip doesnt support installers larger than 2gb. 7zip supports installers up to 4gb in size, but install4j can bundle our resources for us, so it just seems like the right direction to go to remove the unnecessary dependency on winzip7zip selfextractor.p  pUsing the same template file to bundle my resources seems to work on a smaller 200mb exe, while a 2.2gb exe gives me the error during the Extracting files ... step of An error orccurred while trying to read the source file 0.dat.p  pI tried comparing the operations performed using Process Monitor in my working installer vs my failing installer. I managed to find where the differences happen, in the failed installer it attempts to access 0.dat and cannot find it. In the working installer, it does not attempt to access 0.dat, and just opens a read lock to the bundle exe. Just prior to this in both cases, its running code from i4jruntime.jar, so something in the code at the same point is causing my installers to perform differently based on their contents. The only thing I can think of is that my installer is failing to extract its resources into the user directory because of the file size.p  pIve inspected the user directory in my temp directory at the point in the crash, and it appears the 2.2gb zip Ive included is there.p  pAfter making several different installers of varying sizes, it seems to happen consistently once I surpass 2gb installer exe size.p

Negative 1198 pFor context Im working on an app where were considering the use of iBeacon to identify other people nearby who are running the app. Any time that the app is running, the device acts as an iBeacon when the user takes a particular action, their device will range nearby iBeacons to identify others nearby.p  pIm trying to figure out what kind of impact this would have on the battery, to continuously broadcast as an iBeacon.

Negative 1198 pHow can I efficiently detect collision between image layers and generated shapesp  pI need a fast and comprehensive method to detect collision between rotatable image layers and generated shapes. p  pSo far I have just been dividing images into a series of circles that contain the majority of the pixels and then testing each circle against other shapes. To enhance performance I created perimeter circles around each structure and only test these larger circles until two structures are close enough to collide.p  pThe real problem is that it is very difficult to collide a rotatable rectangle, for example, into one of these image structures. Filling a rectangle with circles also just does not seem efficient. Not to mention that Im getting combinatoric explosions that make looping very complex and poor performance.p  pAnyone know a better way to handle this type of collision I write in Java, Python and C.

Negative 1198 pI have a python script where, as part of an evolutionary optimization algorithm, Im evaluating partial derivatives many thousands of times. Ive done a line by line profile, and this partial derivative calculation is taking up the majority of the run time. Im using codescipy.optimize.approxfprimecode to calculate the partial derivatives, and I tried to rewrite it in cython without much success.p  pThe line by line profile is below.

Ultimately, though, the proof is in the pudding, as they say. This version is just not really any faster than the scipy version. The function only has a few variables, so its not a huge computation and theres probably only room for an incremental improvement in one iteration. However, the function  gets called over and over because this is used in an evolutionary optimization algorithm, and so Im expectinghoping that an incremental performance gain multiplied many times over will have a big payoff.p  pCould a cython expert out there take a look at this code and help me figure out if Im on the right track, or if this is just a fools errandp  pThank youp

Negative 1198 pWe have migrated from Microsoft SQL Server to Sybase ASE 15.7 and Im currently in the process of modifying our SSIS packages to work with the new database. Ive created a new SAP ASE OLE DB Provider connection to replace the current Native OLE DBSQL Native Client connection which points to our new database and Im modifying the OLE DB datasources to use this new connection. Ive had to tweak some of the SQL statements slightly in some of the datasources in order to make them work Mainly just prefixing the table names with SAPSR3. is sufficient to get the datasource working but Ive encountered an issue with one that Ive been unable to resolve.p  pThe original select statement, that used to work using the old connection, is as follows.p  precodeselect b.REQUESTID,b.SEQUENCE,b.CALCTYPE,b.PRICE,b.REQUESTER, mina.MATNR as MATNR,lefta.DELTA,8 as DELTA,null as PRPRODHR from ZPRICEMODELLOG a JOIN ZPRICECALCLOG b     on a.RESPONSEID  b.REQUESTID where a.DELTA gt  and a.ACTIVE  X and a.MANDT  900 group by b.REQUESTID,b.SEQUENCE,b.CALCTYPE,b.PRICE,b.REQUESTER,lefta.DELTA,8 codepre  pHowever, after it seems that the SAP ASE connection has an issue with a statement that has both a parameter in combination with Group By. Ive had no problems with parameters in statements without a group by and, likewise, Ive been able to use group by without a parameter in other statements. p  pOnce Ive tweaked it for our new database, If I replace the parameter with a hard coded value, as below, then this works fine and returns data.p  precodeSELECT   b.REQUESTID, b.SEQUENCE, b.CALCTYPE, b.PRICE, b.REQUESTER, mina.MATNR as MATNR, lefta.DELTA,8 as DELTA, null as PRPRODHR FROM     SAPSR3.ZPRICEMODELLOG a, SAPSR3.ZPRICECALCLOG b WHERE    a.RESPONSEID  b.REQUESTID AND a.DELTA gt 20141001000000 AND a.ACTIVE  X AND a.MANDT  900 GROUP BY b.REQUESTID, b.SEQUENCE, b.CALCTYPE, b.PRICE, b.REQUESTER, lefta.DELTA,8 codepre  pHowever, the exact same statement with the parameter fails.p  precodeSELECT   b.REQUESTID, b.SEQUENCE, b.CALCTYPE, b.PRICE, b.REQUESTER, mina.MATNR as MATNR, lefta.DELTA,8 as DELTA, null as PRPRODHR FROM     SAPSR3.ZPRICEMODELLOG a, SAPSR3.ZPRICECALCLOG b WHERE    a.RESPONSEID  b.REQUESTID AND a.DELTA gt   AND a.ACTIVE  X AND a.MANDT  900 GROUP BY b.REQUESTID, b.SEQUENCE, b.CALCTYPE, b.PRICE, b.REQUESTER, lefta.DELTA,8 codepre  pThe Error Message is as follows.p  h2TITLE Microsoft Visual Studioh2  pError at Calc Log Step [ECC CALCLOG [1]] SSIS Error Code DTSEOLEDBERROR.

Negative 1198 pI am making on overworld map for a Renpy game. However, most of the logic uses Pygame with Renpy simply rendering.p  pNow, the problem is that the collision detection is a bit spotty, which is probably owing to the fact that the map scrolls. Ive done single screen collision before, so I know how it works. This is just a bit new to me. The player will jump from one side of an object to another, pass through smaller objects, and sometimes push the map when this should be disabled. p  pThe core logic is there, I just need help refining it, as Im a bit stumped.p  pNow, I understand the elegant and proper solution in a pure Pygame environment would be a rect based camera class. That will not work, in this case, because the map is not rendered in pygame for the sake of integration. This renderer cannot use rects in this way.p  pThat said, here are the relevant bits of code.p  precode            def collideself, xvel, yvel, walls             if self.rect.right  self.xvel gt WIDTH

From main function for example codedata[1]  malloc100  sizeofintcode is called. Then I will create in the mallocfunction one Node and store the checkCorruptionValue OK in it. After it the size, in my example 100  sizeofint. After this I store a 0 for used or a 1 for free in it. Then I will store the location which is returned to data[0]  the storage gets reserved with codesbrk100sizeofintcode and begins at the location. Then i will store the Pointer to the next Node and the previous.p  pI always check the OKvalue if some other malloc had an overflow and overwrited it  then i will exit with an error.p  pIs my Idea totally bullshit or is it okp  pEdit2p  pWhen I will use now Node instead of void I can store also my location pointer to the node. p  precodeNode actualpointer  sbrksizeofNode   actualpointergtcheckCorruption[1]  O printfactualpointer pn, actualpointer printfactualO cn, actualpointergtcheckCorruption[1] printfactualpointerbefore pn, actualpointer actualpointer  actualpointersizeofchar printfactualpointerafter pn, actualpointer codepre  pOutputp  precodeactualpointer 0x1ad4000 actualO O actualpointerbefore 0x1ad4000 actualpointerafter 0x1ad4028 codepre  pBut now I have some problems with codeactualpointer  actualpointersizeofcharcode.

The problem is readLine blocks. The one reason I was aware of is, the stream having no data to read and hence readLine keeps waiting. To check this, I removed readLine and used read function as followsp  precodeProcess proc  Runtime.getRuntime.exec command  BufferedReader br  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReaderproc.getErrorStream int a whileabr.read1     char ch  char a     ifch  n         System.out.printNew line ch     ifch  r         System.out.printCarriage return ch     System.out.printch  codepre  pTo my surprise this code worked and printed the messags New line and Carriage return.

Negative 1198 pstrongemSynopsisemstrong emPayPal payment module from Magento will not convert currency to USD or any paypal accepted currency if your base currency is other than those listed here a hrefhttpswww.paypal.comuswebappshelpcenterhelphubarticlesolutionIdFAQ2390 relnofollowhttpswww.paypal.comuswebappshelpcenterhelphubarticlesolutionIdFAQ2390aemp  pI have a Magento installation with 3 currencies installed.p  pI use PayPal standard payments as a payment option but the problem is that users are charged the same amount but in USD. For example if I have 100 RON and choose to pay by paypal i will be charged for 100 USD instead. p  pI checked the paypal module that makes the redirection available in p  blockquote   pappcodecoreMagePaypalBlockStandardRedirect.phpp blockquote  pand the variables related to currency and amount are correctly set and sent to paypal.p  pI do not know exactly how to tackle this issue and it is very frustrating as I guess the standard PayPal module in Magento is designed by PayPal needs confirmation and is verified for this kind of situations.p  pstrongInfo 1strong PayPal does not accept some currencies like Romanian Lei for example which happens to be the base currency for this shop for transactions allowed currencies are listed here a hrefhttpswww.paypal.comuswebappshelpcenterhelphubarticlesolutionIdFAQ2390 relnofollowhttpswww.paypal.comuswebappshelpcenterhelphubarticlesolutionIdFAQ2390a so by the time you click submit they will convert only the currency sign to  and not the amount.

Negative 1198 pIm currently making a program in Java using the Ecipse IDE. The plan is that people can create plugins for this program, and have them load at Runtime.p  pIve made a few plugins myself, however am having a hard time exporting them from eclipse.p  pFor example, the Serial plugin allows the program to talk to Serial devices.

Thus all of the Main programs code, and I really dont want to be doing that. The idea is that the plugin isnt standalone, and should only contain its own code.p  pSo is there a way to select which dependencies to export with the jar file Or am I better off exporting it as a nonrunnable jar file, and then adding the class file dependencies manuallyp  pCheersp  pstrongtldrstrong How do I export a jar file from eclipse with only the dependencies I choose, not all of them.p

Negative 1198 pIm trying to get the value of a password input box on window.onload however it keeps returning an empty string. If I set a break point and step through my code then it returns the correct string. And if i set a breakpoint anywhere before it and then just continue running the code it will also work. But running it without a break point somewhere stopping the code at some point or even using the longest setTimeout doesnt seem to work.p  pA little background im writing a solution to rid my design of the chrome autocomplete yellow background.

Negative 1198 pIve read lots of tutorials on Python and am currently in an intro to programming class using python, but I cant figure this out. Ive searched stack overflow, dani web, java2s, github and many others but cant understand what Im doing wrong. p  pThis is for a final project in my programming class and Id like to do a couple of things in class and then import them into the main program. p  pEventually I hope to use this in my workplace as well and I want it to present the user with a menu of options. 1 Add names and typing speeds. 2 delete a name by valuethe name of a student  Id like to do this with a class if possible. 3 print the names and speeds. 4 print a list of the speeds. 5 print the average speeds from the list of speeds which Id also like to do in a class. and 6 to quit the program. p  pI tried to be ambitious and create a random name generator so I created a function to print the list of names as well, but this is due Monday morning so I scrapped that project since I wasnt getting anywhere. p  pThe parts that arent working are 2  deleting a name and 3  averaging the score.

Negative 1198 pI have read about the variants of hashtable but it is not clear to me which one is more appropriate for a system that is low on memory we have a memory constraint limit.br LinearQuadratic probing works well for sparse tables.br I think Double hashing is the same as Quadratic in this aspect.br External chaining does not have issue with clustering.br Most textbooks I have checked seem to assume that a extra space will always be available but practically in most example implementations I have seen since the hashtable is never halved take much more space than really needed.br So which variant of a hashtable is most efficient when we want to make the best usage of memory  p  pstrongUpdatestrongbr So my question is not only about the size of the buckets. My understanding is that both the size of the buckets strongandstrong the performance under load is what matters. Because if the size of the bucket is small but the table degrades on 50 load then this means we need to resize to a larger table often.p

Negative 1198 pIm dealing with GroovyGrails and a legacy database that uses multiple rows per logical unit.  For example a user will be represented by multiple rows which contains historical data.  One of our requirements is to access these logical units as one object instance ... in other words have multiple rows be tied to one object instance.  Grails cant do this natively, however, it seems like this might be possible with Hibernate.p  pI have tried the following oversimplification, but it gets the point acrossp  precodeEntity Tablename  USERS Whereclause  DATE  MAXDATE class UserDetail     Properties   Id Columnname  ID Integer id   Columnname  DATE Date date   Columnname  FIRSTNAME String firstName   Columnname  LASTNAME String lastName   Entity Tablename  USERS Whereclause  DATE  MAXDATE class User extends UserDetail     Properties   ElementCollection   CollectionTablename  USERS, joinColumns  JoinColumnname  ID   ListltUserDetailgt details  codepre  pThis approach creates two classes, both of them mapped to the same table.  The User class extends the UserDetail class and has a collection of UserDetail objects.  The User class represents the row with the most recent date and the UserDetail collection represents the remaining rows.  We like this approach because it allows us to define column to property mapping once.  Unfortunately this approach results in a dtype column missing error.  It seems that this can be solved by adding a DiscriminatorColumn and DiscriminatorValue annotations, however, Im not sure how to translate the Where annotation we are using to these two annotations.  Is this possiblep  pThe other approach we have tried is thisp  precodeEntity Tablename  USERS Whereclause  DATE  MAXDATE class User     Inner classes   static class Detail         Properties     Integer id     Date date     String firstName     String lastName        Properties   Id Columnname  ID Integer id   Columnname  DATE Date date   Columnname  FIRSTNAME String firstName   Columnname  LASTNAME String lastName   ElementCollection   CollectionTablename  USERS, joinColumns  JoinColumnname  ID   AttributeOverrides[       AttributeOverridename  id, column  Columnname  ID,       AttributeOverridename  date, column  Columnname  DATE       AttributeOverridename  lastName, column  Columnname  FIRSTNAME,       AttributeOverridename  firstName, column  Columnname  LASTNAME   ]   ListltUser.Detailgt details  codepre  pAgain the User class represents the one with the most recent date and it contains a collection of Detail objects which will represent the remaining data.  However, Im not sure how to limit the Detail class to be only rows where DATE  MAXDATE.  Also, the issue with this approach is that Im getting a MappingException Repeated column in mapping error.p  pAre either one of these approaches possible  If they are, what needs to be changed to make them work  If these approaches wont work, how would I go about accomplishing thisp

Negative 1198 pAt the top of my view controllers view, I have inserted a custom subclass of UIScrollView as an IBOutlet. To this custom UIScrollView, I pass it a list of NSString objects which the subclass then loops through while creating and adding buttons to the scroll view. On an iPad, if there are only 3 buttons added then the scroll view is leftaligned. This is good when there are multiple buttons that exceed the screen width, but I want the scroll view to be centered and not scrollable when the content size of the scroll view is smaller than the view width. Ideally Id like to use the intrinsic size of the UIScrollView based on its contents then always keep the scroll view vertically centered. Is this possible using IB and AutoLayoutp
Negative 1198 pSo I have done this in Java before, but I am newer to python, so I need to know hoe to do the followingp  pI have a bunch of PDF files that my python script downloads from a website. Those PDFs contain product information on different products. Not all PDFs have the same categoriesdata. There is a category, Application, that spans 2 data lines in one PDF and 1 in the other. I am making dictionaries out of the data by collecting the one side and then the other and zipping them into a dictionary, however, since Application takes up 2 lines in one of the PDFs, I am forced to merge those separate list pieces into 1. However, if I do that for all of them, than the 1 lined one will get mixed with the next line. How can I make it sense if it is 1 or 2 lines and do something accordingly.

Negative 1198 pI was reading about a hrefhttpsdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialjavagenericsnonReifiableVarargsType.htmlvarargs heap pollutiona and I dont really get how varargs or nonreifiable types would be responsible for problems that do not already exist without genericity. Indeed, I can very easily replace p  precodepublic static void faultyMethodListltStringgt... l      Object[] objectArray  l  Valid     objectArray[0]  Arrays.asList42     String s  l[0].get0  ClassCastException thrown here  codepre  pwithp  precodepublic static void faultyMethodString... l      Object[] objectArray  l  Valid     objectArray[0]  42   ArrayStoreException thrown here     String s  l[0]  codepre  pThe second one simply uses the covariance of arrays, which is really the problem here. Even if codeListltStringgtcode was reifiable, I guess it would still be a subclass of codeObjectcode and I would still be able to assign any object to the array. Of course I can see theres a little difference between the two, but this code is faulty whether it uses generics or not.p  pWhat do they mean by emheap pollutionem it makes me think about memory usage but the only problem they talk about is potential type unsafetiness, and how is it different from any type violation using arrays covariancep

Negative 1198 pWe all have terrible experiences with two factor authentication implemented by Visa, MasterCard and other card networks. Here in India, it is mandatory to implement 3D secure to process ecommerce transactions. This leads to many bad experiences as the user gets redirected every time to the VisaMasterCard website. Also they have a very bad user interface. Is there any way you could implement 3D secure without redirecting the user. I know one possible method could be to use iFrames but that also brings in the question of bad user experience.p  pSo my question is, What is the best way to implement 3D secure by card issuers without redirecting the user and hopefully improving their existing UI. I could not stumble across their APIs so please do let me know if there are existing solutions.p

Negative 1198 pHere is code that works fine for string with length equal or less then 12 in case of int and 20 in case of long. In this code I use formula N1  p1  p2  p3 ...  for calculation of the rank, where p1, p2, p3 are the number of occurrences of repeated characters. But in case of large inputs result of factorial calculation does not fit in an integer or long. So, I dont understand what part of code do i need to fix and how Do I need to fix factorial method or do i need change formula for calculation of rank As far as i know according to modular multiplicative inverse i can use formula  ApowerB,Mod2Mod, where A is iterativeFactorialsorts.size,B is countRepetitionssorts and Mod is 1000003. But if i place this formula instead of N1  p1  p2  p3 ...  ive got incorrect result. So, I will be very grateful for clarification of using modular multiplicative inverse for calculating rank and the way I can fix my code for large input. p  pExample rank of adfadfcvcvbgfgrewfdfdsfgfgfhfhcxxse must be 874647, but now Ive got 511521p  precodepublic static int myFindRankString A         int rank  0         String sortedAndUnique           int temp         SetltCharactergt uniques  new TreeSetltCharactergt         ListltCharactergt sorts  new ArrayListltCharactergt          for int i  0 iltA.length1 i             char x  A.charAti             uniques.addx                   for int i  0 iltA.length1 i             char x  A.charAti             sorts.addx                   for Character c  uniques              sortedAndUnique  sortedAndUnique  c                   for int i  0 iltA.length1 i             for int j  0 jltA.length j                  if A.charAti  sortedAndUnique.charAtj                      Character c  A.charAti                     sorts.removec                     i                     temp  0                      while sortedAndUnique.charAttemp  A.charAti                          Character x  sortedAndUnique.charAttemp                         temp                         if sorts.containsx                              sorts.removex                             rank  rank  iterativeFactorialsorts.size countRepetitionssorts                             sorts.addx                                                                    if sortedAndUnique.charAttemp  A.charAti                          Character y  A.charAti                         sorts.removey                                          break                  else                      Character c  sortedAndUnique.charAtj                     if sorts.containsc                           sorts.removec                         rank  rank  iterativeFactorialsorts.size countRepetitionssorts                         sorts.addc                                                                      return rank11000003        public static int countRepetitionsList A          int repetitions  1          ListltCharactergt chars  new ArrayListltCharactergt         SetltCharactergt unique  new TreeSetltCharactergt          for int i  0 iltA.size1 i             Character x  Character A.geti             chars.addx             unique.addx                    for Character c  unique              repetitions  repetitions  iterativeFactorialCollections.frequencychars, c                   return repetitions         public static int iterativeFactorialint number           if number  0             return 1          int i         forinumber numbergt1 iinumber              number                   return i      codepre  pCustom power methodp  precode public static int callPowint num                int ans  1, base  num          int power  1000003  2          while power gt 0               if power  1                   return ans  base  1000003                            if power  2  0                   base  base  base  1000003                  power  2               else                   ans  ans  base  1000003                  power                                  return ans       codepre

both lines 169 and 170 and I cant seem to fix it. Ive tried to move the whole boxElimina part upwards of boxNumeroAlunni, and while that seems to fix the problem, when I actually use the boxNumeroAlunni it seems to run its actionlistener first, then boxEliminas for no apparent reason, and then boxNumeroAlunnis again and I cant realize the reason of that. Sorry for my pretty broken English and also sorry for variables name in Italian. I havent been programming for some months now so I wouldnt be surprised if the errors cause is pretty stupid. Also, it is my first time using a JTable and more than one JPanel, so it could be that somehow.p
Negative 1198 pIve got a weird one here, perhaps youve experienced this.p  pIve got a remotely hosted WordPress install that, when accessed from this computer only my 2 immediate office mate neighbours verified, never loads the wpadminnavmenus.php page.p  pThe behaviour is literally a forever spinning wheel that never leaves the page you attempted to load from. Its never able to hit the page so it doesnt show any debug.p  pIve upped the phpmaxvars from 1000  3000. No Luck. Loading on my local MAMP server, this page loads without lag. As mentioned, 2 computers in the same office can access and save this page. Ive rebooted.p
Negative 1198 pim doing an Admin panel thinked to work with 1920px display, but many user dont have large screens.

If the screen is 1200px or shorter, i have no problem because it will display 3 up and 3 down or three rows of 2.p  pIm usin a 100 width box to show the propertiesp  p1920px a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comPVZeJ.jpg relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comPVZeJ.jpgap  p1700px a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comIyQeT.jpg relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comIyQeT.jpgap
