Positive 1646 pIm having trouble with the fixed positioned slideshow at a hrefhttpsartemestest.myshopify.com relnofollowhttpsartemestest.myshopify.comap  pIts working fine on all browsers except Safari on my mac.

Positive 1646 pI created a navigation with 2 overlay page. The first for my menu and the second for a contact form.p  pThe first problem is the switch between two color for the word Menu.

Positive 1646 pI am new to android and I have just started programming a simple app to try different things out. p  pI was programming a ListView and, in the same way a GridView but there is something I got wrong. Each item is a couple of an image and a text field.p  pstrong img  text strongp  pI want to be able to choose any number of list items, keeping them enlightened for all the selection process, before passing the selected items to the next activity. If I want to  deselect one of them, I simply have to reclick on the item to have the selection disappear. For this purpose I use a custom selector so that when the item is pressed it changes colours. p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comvqiCw.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvqiCw.png altap  pIf the items are all contained in a screen, everything is ok. But as soon as they grow in number and recycling kicks in, the enlightening of selected items which get out of the screen is lost. I have debugged the state of items and those whose enlightening is lost are still correctly selected, so I think its just a problem on how the graphic reloads when an item is restored after it went out of the device screen.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comdBFoa.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdBFoa.png altap  pHeres the code of the activity layoutp  precodelt itemsselection.xml gt

Positive 1646 pUsing Winforms and vb.net VS 2012p  pIf I have a large scrollable panel and I put a bunch of smaller panels inside the larger one. When I scroll the larger panel up or down, some of the smaller panels will scroll out of view. My question is, can I put a listener on the smaller panels so that the smaller panel knows when it has scrolled out of viewp  pI cant use the .visible property because that is always set to true even when the panel is not in the window. I also know I can set the .focus property to bring it back into view, but it can still lose focus when in the viewable window as soon as something else takes focus.p  pSo is there a property or something that I can listen for that detects when the panel has scrolled out of view And if not, is there something else I can do to detect thisp  pThanks.p

Positive 1646 pHello Ive been having a problem with the jQuery on my site. Currently the site runs on version 2.1.4, but I would like to add a ShoutBox that uses an older version of jQuery. I know it may be a little counterproductive to use two different libraries, but I cannot think of another way. This shoutbox works well for what we need such as spam protection, admin features, no required login or database usage, fast and very minimum amount of files. If you have any suggestions for a new chatbox that works with a newer version, thatd be great. If not, I would like to find a solution that will allow me to use this shoutbox. I have tried the jQuery.noconflict solution, but it doesnt seem to work for me.p  pI have also tried to load the migrate jQuery plugin, which makes it all work, just one small problem. The shoutbox works great except that the scroll bar doesnt identify when a new message is sent and it never scrolls to the very bottom of the chat page. It essentialy just stays at the top and keeps getting smaller when new messages populate the body. p  pBelow is the part of the shoutbox script where the auto scrolling takes place.

Negative 1646 pI know this is a bad idea Certainly for safe programming the stack for a given thread should be considered private to that thread. But POSIX at least guarantees that all of a threads memory is shared and writeable by other threads, which means the stack of one thread can in theory be written to by another thread. So Im curious how one could do that.p  pThe only way I can think of would be to pass the address of a local variable in thread B to thread A and have A start writing to that general area. But this doesnt fully emulate function calls in C. In particular Im curious if its possible to say, have thread A sleep while its program counter is set to the first line of some function that takes parameters, and then on thread B actually push those parameters onto the stack, then resume thread A and have it execute as if the function were originally called in thread A with those parameters. I think this requires thread B to be able to access thread As registers under at least x86 calling conventions, and Im not sure thats possible. p

Negative 1646 pI have some questions on Cache synchronization operations.p  pInvalidate  before cpu tries to read  a portion of memory updated by a device, the corresponding memory needs to be invalidated.p  pFlush  Before the device read a portion of memory updated by CPU, CPU must flushwrite back is also correct  the contents from cache to memory, so that Device reads the contents from memory with updated contents.If flush is not carried out it may read junk data present in memory as the memory is not still updated with contents written to cache. p  pPlease confirm whether my above understanding is correctp  pwhen you want to combine both flush and invalidate I heard that while playing with device control descriptors we need to synchronize by combining flush and invalidate.

Negative 1646 pIve got a very large and mature C code base that Im trying to use SWIG on to generate a C interface for.  I cannot change the actual C code itself but we can use whatever SWIG offers in the way of extendingupdating it.  Im facing an issue where a C function that is written as below is causing issues in C.p  precodeA SomeClassnextA codepre  pThe caller might do something likep  precodeA acurr  0 while acurr  scgtnextacurr  0      if acurr isoftype B          B b  Ba         ...do some stuff with b..          elseif acurr isoftype C      ...  codepre  pEssentially, iterating through a container of elements that, depending on their true type, does something different.  The SWIG generated C layer for the next function unfortunately does the followingp  precodereturn new A codepre  pSo the calling code in C cannot determine if the returned object is actually a derived class or not, it actually appears to always be the base class which does make sense.  Ive come across several solutionsp  ol liUse the extend SWIG keyword to add a method on an object and ultimately call dynamiccast.  The downside to this approach, as I see it, is that this requires you to know the inheritance hierarchy.  In my case it is rather huge and I see this is as a maintenance issue.li liUse the factory keyword to supply the method and the derived types and have SWIG automatically generate the dynamiccast code.  This appears to be a better solution that the first, however upon a deeper look it still requires you to hunt down all the methods and all the possible derived types it could return.  Again, a huge maintenance issue.  I wish I had a doc link for this but I cant find one.  I found out about this functionality by looking through the example code that comes with SWIG.li liCreate a C method to create an instance of the derived object and transfer the cPtr to the new instance.  While I consider this clumsy, it does work.  See an example below.li ol  pre     public static object castToobject fromObj, Type toType              object retval  null          BaseClass fromObj2  fromObj as BaseClass         HandleRef hr  BaseClass.getCPtrfromObj2         IntPtr cPtr  hr.Handle         object toObj  Activator.CreateInstancetoType, cPtr, false           make sure it actually is what we think it is         if fromObj.GetType.IsInstanceOfTypetoObj                      return toObj                   return retval      pre  pAre these really the options  And if Im not willing to dig through all the existing functions and class derivations, then Im left with 3  Any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 1646 pIn visual studio 2008 SP1 applied there appears to be a bug in the state workflow designer tool. p  pOn adding a HandleExternalEvent activity and setting the Interface type to that of an interface in a reference assembly with the same prefixed namespace eg XX.Core.Contracts as the namespace of the interface containing assembly and XX.StateWorkflowLibrary as the namespace of the workflow , on trying to reload the designer it will fail with the message Could not find type .... yet it will build and run fine.

Negative 1646 pFollowing my previous question, in which I wanted to dump all the variables in the stack from the current and all the previous frame that can be seen here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5130414isthereawaytoexaminethestackvariablesatruntimeincIs there a way to examine the Stack variables at runtime in cap  pI was suggested to intercept the calls manually or use AOP framework like PostSharp to simplify such a task. I looked at PostSharp and the interception arguments dont include the variables in the current stack frame. I wonder if there is a simple way to automatically get all the local variables in the current stack frame. I suppose I can perform code analysis and generate code that copies all those values into a collection, but maybe there is a builtin mechanism that does it.p  pThanks in advance for any suggestions.p  pEDIT I should have given more detail of why I want to do this. I want to be able to suspend execution in the middle of a method. If I had the contents of the stack I could resume execution later, or even serialize it and continue it in another machine assuming it is relatively simple code, so no threads or IO for example. It is ok to run a code analysis tool that would allow me to automatically generate extra code that saves this state. I think I will probably have to analyze the CIL to do this.p

Negative 1646 pI was reading around for undoredo techniques, I understand how should it be implemented I found it intuitive.p  pHowever Im thinking about the collection that should be used as history,p  pA lot of people use stack, but C stack is implemented as an array, and this is a problem If I use a limited history for example, for 2000 commands, when the limit is reached I dont have a way to remove items from the end of the stack, and if I find a way to do it, I have to move all elements of the array and this for each time a command is done.p  pA LinkedList looks good, but it wastes a lot of memory.p  pMy last option is a custom implementation of a linkedlist, a SingleLinkedList. A node of this list consist of Value property and a NextNode pointer property so Im using double memory for each item but nothing more,except if Im using things smaller than sizeofvoid.p  pIm also storing a pointer to the first element and a pointer to the last element in the collection.p  pI can easily add commands to the history and move them to the redohistory in this way, however I cant create a limited history because RemoveLast is not allowed I have to go through the whole collection to remove the last item.p  pSo my question is Should I use a LinkedList or my custom SingleLinkedListp  pstrongUpdate 1strongp  pThanks for answers at the moment, in my situation I dont have a memory problem, well, I dont know who I am targeting, Im creating an utility program and in my own idea of utility program, they should waste least cpumemory possible obviusly dont tell me write it in c so, because there is a big difference.p  pIn my opinion, the singlelinkedlist works well, I dont really like to limit the History, Im thinking about Photoshop where your history is unlimited.p  pIm only feared from what could happen when the undo history becomes really big, like 8 hours of use. Thats why I was thinking about limiting it through a LinkedList.p  pAs someone else stated however, if I limit the linkedlist to a big size, around 60000 commands I think they should be enough, Im only wasting a small amount of memory, 4 bytes  60000 compared to singlelinkedlist.p  pThat said, I think Ill use the LinkedList, however just to be sure, would have been ok if Ive used an history without limitp  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pemAkash Kavaem Well, what you say its important but you misunderstood WHY I want use a LinkedList and why I dont want use a stack. The main problem with Stack is that its necessary to limit its size, and there isnt a fast way to remove older commands when this limit is reached its an array and doubling its dimension every time its not something that we want.p  pA single linked list think about how its built is fast as a stack all stack operations are O1 and doesnt have a limit. However in this case its strongneededstrong not to have a limit, otherwise we have the same problem as stack, we dont have a fast way to remove last element of our singlelinkedlist which behaves like a stack,because we dont know our previous node element from the last node.p  pIn this case its quite easy, so, to think about a LinkedList, where you have the Previous pointer. However we are using 2 additional pointers for each element of our Stack which is built through a linkedlist this time, which is like using 3 times more memory than what its necessary to store a Command with an array we have normal memory usage, singlelinkedlist has 2 times memory usage and linkedlist has 3 times memory usage.p  pSo what I was basically asking is which is the best collection to implement a stack for undoredo pattern.p  pYour answer made me think that even if I create 60000 command in 1 program its around 5MB of memory in a program, which is not so much.p  pBasically if you want to limit your undoredo history you need a LinkedList, otherwise a SingleLinkedList is better.p

Negative 1646 pHow my application works is once a user opens it, it will open to a screen where it will find out depending on the button the user clicks, how many holes of golf they want to play 18 or 9.  From there it will launch the main activity where, depending on what the user chose, will depend on the rules of the application.  ie  If they choose 18, the save button wont activate until the 18th hole, same for 9, it will activate on the 9th hole.  This will also trigger a final score notification, etc.p  pIm curious if I should create a separate class for 9 holes and 18 holes, or if I should just pass some sort of value from the open screen, to the main activity that sets the values at 9 or 18p  pI guess I am curious on this programming etiquette as I am not very familiar with the best practice of something like this.p  pEntry screen will look something like this as of now I have not finished 9 hole button or help button but will be the same as 18 unless launching a seperate classp  precodecase R.id.button18Holes                   LAUNCHES ACTUAL APPLICATION                  Intent myIntent  new Intentsrc.getContext, EasyPar.class         startActivityForResultmyIntent, 0          Intent iStartValues  new Intentthis, EasyPar.class         String[] startValues  new String[] 18         iStartValues.putExtrastrings, startValues         startActivityiStartValues          break      case R.id.button9Holes         break      case R.id.buttonHelp         break      codepre  pIm not sure if that string array is the proper way to pass one to another activity eitherp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1646 pWhats the best data type andor format to write and read a date and time value in the Windows Registryp  pIm using C with MFC and working with CTime and CTimeSpan objects, but I feel comfortable using the CRT library as well.p  pMy understanding is that to correctly represent a time value, a 64bit integer should be used.  That precludes using MFC methods such as a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarybb983542.aspx relnofollowWinAppExWriteInta.p  pFor readability and debugging purposes, I would have liked to use the CTimeFormatGmt method to write a string to the registry and then read and parse it later, but the lack of a MSVC runtime implementation of strptime prevents easy parsing on read.  While I could implement strptime, Im hoping for a lighterweight solution.p  pI have not explored the COleDateTime classes yet.p  pThanks in advance, this is my first StackOverflow question.p

I did not test any Qt3 application yet, but I guess they behave the same way.p  pNote It gives me the same issue with Qt4 context menus.p  pNote The menu itself works, but its invisible after the first time..p

Negative 1646 pHi can any one give me a simple example of how to use the isosurface function in MATLAB.  The example given if you type codehelp isosurfacecode is quite confusing. Searching on google did not help as no one gives simple examples anywhere. All of them use predefined functions like  codeflowcode. p  pFor starters, suppose i have points codex,y,zcode where z0 and at each point I define a constant  function codefx,y,z6code. So if I use the isosurface function on the isovalue code6code I would like MATLAB to give me a 3d plot with the XY plane highlighted in some colour, say green. p

Negative 1646 pI have web application running with a default impl of a backend service. One should be able to implement the interface and drop the jar into the plugins folder which is not in the apps classpath. Once the server is restarted, the idea is to load the new jar into the classloader, and have it take part in dependency injection. I am using Spring DI using Autowired. The new plugin service impl will have Primary annotation. So given two impls of the interface, the primary should be loaded.p  pI got the jar loaded into the classloader and can invoke the impl manually. But I havent been able to get to to participate in the Dependency Injection, and have it replace the default impl.p  pHeres a simplified examplep  precodeController public class MyController     Autowired    Service service   default.jar Service DefaultService implements Service     public void print         System.out.printlnprinting DefaultService.print        plugin.jar not in classpath yet Service Primary MyNewService implements Service     public void print        System.out.printlnprinting MyNewService.print       codepre  pFor lack of better place, I loaded the plugin jar from the ContextListener  p  precodepublic class PluginContextLoaderListener extends org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener           Override         protected void customizeContextServletContext servletContext,                                         ConfigurableWebApplicationContext wac                  System.out.printlnInit Plugin                 PluginManager pluginManager  PluginManagerFactory.createPluginManagerplugins                 pluginManager.init                      Prints the MyNewService.print method                       Service service  Service pluginManager.getServiceservice                     service.print                                           ltlistenergt             ltlistenerclassgtcom.plugin.PluginContextLoaderListenerltlistenerclassgt      ltlistenergt codepre  pEven after I have loaded the jar into the classloader, DefaultService is still being injected as service. Any idea how I get the plugin jar to participate into the springs DI lifecycle p  pEdited To put it simply, I have a war file that has a few plugin jars in a plugins directory inside the war. Based on a value from a configuration file that the app looks at, when the app is started, I want to load that particular plugin jar and run the application with it. That way, I can distribute the war to anyone, and they can choose which plugin to run based on a config value without having to to repackage everything. This is the problem I am trying to solve.p

Negative 1646 pIm working on a bit of code for a project at work, and am kind of stumped on a nuance of jQuery. In the following code, It should look down my list and iterate each text input element with the same general name as the last one, but with one number higher in the name. Instead what its doing is iterating the name of each text input element with one number higher than the last number that existed when the link was created. So, it should look like a more complicated version of this thisp  precodeltinput nameindustry1 gt lta href classaddFieldgtltagt lt Clicked twice gt ltinput nameindustry2 gt lta href classaddFieldgtltagt ltinput nameindustry3 gt lta href classaddFieldgtltagt codepre  p...And instead, it looks like thisp  precodeltinput nameindustry1 gt lta href classaddFieldgtltagt lt Clicked twice gt ltinput nameindustry2 gt lta href classaddFieldgtltagt ltinput nameindustry2 gt lta href classaddFieldgtltagt  codepre  pI think the problem is that the line which selects the value to iterate is set when .live binds to the new add link.

Negative 1646 pIve built a simple jQuery animated accordion menu using the slideUp and slideDown functions also tried it with slideToggle and while it looks great it the animation is perfectly smooth even though all accordion menu elements are the same height. As you can see, a hrefhttpjqueryui.comdemosaccordion relnofolloweven here on jQueryUIs examplea, when you click an element, the bottom of the menu rises a little bit and then settles back after the animation completes. I assume this has to do with a slight timing difference in the animations but even setting a delay doesnt fix the issue. Anyone know I way to smooth out this issue Its important since the site Im working on is essentially one giant accordion menu so the issue becomes very noticeable. p

Just pure PHP pages are called. If there is any pagination in the page which was called by cURL I use meta redirects to redirect to next page.p  pI dont want to use cURL inside of a loop.

Some php pages might have pagination, some dont have any pagination. Thats why I really would like to avoid using cURL calls inside of the loop to paginate.p  pIf pagination is needed, there is pagination in called PHP page. If I visit the called page on browser than it is redirecting me to the next page. I expected the same thing when I call the page with cURL.p  pMeaning if I visit a hrefhttpsiteurl.comcronstransfermembers.php relnofollowhttpsiteurl.comcronstransfermembers.phpa on my browser it is redirecting me to next page with meta redirect example  a hrefhttpsiteurl.comcronstransfermembers.phppagex relnofollowhttpsiteurl.comcronstransfermembers.phppagexap  pI expected the same thing with cURL.

Negative 1646 pI am attempting to write Android applications with Scala in Eclipse. The problem Im running into is that the deployed APK file is much too large  since you cant link Android apps to external libraries, any code used has to be copied into the APK file, but most Scala apps dont need most of the Scala library. Somewhere I read that even a large application can be packaged with only 50kb or so of the Scala library, compared to the 4mb that my Android device is telling me my test app takes up.p  pIve already tried the Treeshaker plugin for Eclipse, and I can see in the progress window that it is running, but it doesnt seem to do anything. Disintegrating it from my project doesnt have an impact on the final file size. Ive also tried configuring Proguard myself, but I cant find a configuration that doesnt either not affect the file size and I realize that Proguard only runs when use Eclipses export wizard, which I used to test this or crash with cryptic error messages, such as 1. Well, ok, the entire error message is Conversion to Dalvik format failed with error code 1, which is hardly more helpful because I cant find any clear documentation of that error message and it doesnt tell me what part of my code or configuration is causing the problem...p  pSo. Any insight on how I can get this workingp

Therefore, no acknowledgments happen on the attribute layer.li liNo other Bluetooth or Bluetooth Low Energy devices are connected. Nothing is performed over WLAN.

The sequence number is incremented by one after each sent packet.p  pOn the receiving side, a programmable development board, that incorporates a a hrefhttpwww.csr.comproducts45csrenergyCSR1000a BLE chip, is used that receives the packets and prints the received sequence numbers to the serial connection.p  pstrongMy problems are the followingstrongp  ul lipAfter some time, packets start getting dropped.

Then, 17 packets are missing. p  pWhen I reduce the characteristic value size, the problem still persists. p  pWhen I write at 100Hz instead of at 50Hz, the picture is the same  only that the drops start occuring after around 35 packets and that 57 packets are dropped between the successful transmission of four packets.p  pWith the lost packets, the resulting transmission rate is around 5 kbits, regardless of the frequency of writes. This is clearly below the 305 kbits that should be technically possible over Bluetooth Low Energy.pli lipThe problem also occurs into the opposite direction, when I am sending packets from the development board to the iPhone 4S. Again, 5 kbits is the maximum that I am getting. The Notification mechanism is used for this scenario.

Negative 1646 pI need a ReadWriteLock that is NOT reentrant, because the lock may be released by a different thread than the one that acquired it. I realized this when I started to get IllegalMonitorStateException intermittently.p  pIm not sure if nonreentrant is the right term. A ReentrantLock allows the thread that currently holds to lock to acquire it again. I do NOT want this behaviour, therefore Im calling it nonreentrant. p  pThe context is that I have a socket server using a thread pool. There is NOT a thread per connection. Requests may get handled by different threads. A client connection may need to lock in one request and unlock in another request. Since the requests may be handled by different threads, I need to be able to lock and unlock in different threads.p  pAssume for the sake of this question that I need to stay with this configuration and that I do really need to lock and unlock in different requests and therefore possibly different threads.p  pIts a ReadWriteLock because I need to allow multiple readers OR an exclusive writer.p  pIt looks like this could be written using AbstractQueuedSynchronizer but Im afraid if I write it myself Ill make some subtle mistake. I can find various examples of using AbstractQueuedSynchronizer but not a ReadWriteLock.p  pI could take the OpenJDK ReentrantReadWriteLock source and try to remove the reentrant part but again Im afraid I wouldnt get it quite right.p  pIve looked in Guava and Apache Commons but didnt find anything suitable. Apache Commons has RWLockManager which might do what I need but Im not sure and it seems more complex than I need.p

Negative 1646 pI have a serverside generated JS file linked in my HTML head.p  pI use this, to be able to insert scripts dynamically from anywhere inside my PHP scripts to the head tag.p  pThere is a global accessible object I can pass JS code, then it stores it in the session with a key, inserts the key to the HTML Frame template, then the browser loads the stored script by loading the dynamic script that outputs it from the session storage.p  pThis works fine in Firefox, Chrome, and even in IE, but not in Opera.p  pIn Opera, from about 10 reload attempts, only in 1 attempt the script gets executed.p  pCurrently all of the dynamically generated JS code is inside a jQuery DOM Ready event. This may be related to the problem I think.p  pLoading the dynamic script with AJAX and evaluating it would surely solve this problem, but I want a clear HTML output, without direct scripts in the head. This way of loading and evaluating is impossible from a linked static script, as the template engine has to insert the session storage key of the script to the HTML frame template.p  pEDIT Dynamic Script Outputp  precodefunction Calls to some jQuery Plugins on class and id selectors on some reloads getting executed, but mostly not  codepre  pDOMp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt             ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetUTF8gt   lt CSS Links, Meta tags gt ltscript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt            ltjQuery Plugins External Script tagsgt ltscript srchttp[MYDOMAIN]dynamic.js[JSSTORAGEKEYMD5]gtltscriptgt                                    ltheadgt ltbodygt lt VALID HTML5 CODE gt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pEDIT 2 I may have found the cause of the problem Opera requests external scripts more than once.

Negative 1646 pIn my application I have faced a small issue in encoding and decoding images to String and pass it to web service.        After getting the bitmap image, I convert it  into byte[] and encode to String value but in Some cases it shows error I dont know why it comes.        And one more doubt is Base64 class only supports to convert Bitmap image to String or any other tools available to do the same.p  pThanks in advance...p
Negative 1646 pInside every aggregate the consistence must be guaranteed. It is easy to do it in the repository because I can always use transactions from the database or framework. I have doubts about what happens outside the repository. A service might need to work with more than one aggregate to process a request. There could be problems during the processing in the service or while the aggregates are persisted.p  pIf something goes wrong during the processing in the service I could raise an exception. That way the operation will be atomic. This is my first concern. Is that a good practice The problem I see is that it will be hard to recover from that. There will be no easy way to leave all the aggregates with the state they had before the failed operation.p  pThe other problem I have is what happens if one of the aggregates fails to be persisted. How do I ensure the consistency of the information Do I have to use database transactions outside the repositories I was thinking that it might not be the best solution because I should not be thinking in the database when I am designing the domain model.p

Negative 1646 pSo this is what Im trying to achieve...p  pI have a site with the URL with the following formatp  pemsomedb.mysite.comemp  pemsomedbem can be many different DBs. The problem is, different DBs require different versions of the site. These different versions are setup as subsites of the parent site.p  pFor example emsomedb.mysite.com1.0em and emsomedb2.mysite.com2.0emp  pCurrently Im using Response.Redirect in the parent site to redirect to the proper version. What Im HOPING to do is to HIDE the version number so that all DBs appear to be using the same site, and so the URL appears the same if a DB is updated to a newer version.p  pIve been messing around with using RewritePath and Server.Transfer with not a lot of success... The main problem from what I can gather is that Rewrite and Transfer only work within the same site, but the individual versions are technically different subsites sites.p  pDoes anybody have any ideas how I may be able to achieve what Im trying to dop

The reason for this is that in my jQuery I use codeSPNAMEcode to output the name of the SubProgram ex. codesubProgram1code. I use codeSPIDcode to let the jQuery know which program to put the subprogrm under ex. if codeSPID  1code the subprogram would be under program1. The amounts that are contained within codeSPContentcode are monthly totals that are entered in the codeforeachcode loop.p  pcodeprogram1                 Jan  Feb  Marcodep  precode  subProgram1 100 200 300 etc... codepre  pWhat this all means is I cannot lose this line codeSPMonthRow[item.SPNAME]  SPContentcode unless I can output codeSPContentcode amount data another way. I am open to all solutions as long as I can keep the data flowing out of the function in JSON so the jQuery can display what I need it to.

Negative 1646 pMy application includes a typeahead feature when a user is typing into a comment box.

Negative 1646 pI have an interesting problem that Ive been trying to simplify. I have a telecommunications client who has several signup forms  each representing a different programoffer. Each form is essentially the same, but some have form fields that others do not. As you can imagine, this is a nightmare both in the database and in the CRUD code. p  pRight now as it stands, each form is processed individually and goes into a dedicated MySQL table for each application form. So horrifically, each application has a separate CRUD code. I wish to defer to the experienced as to how to best handle this situation. p  pI thought about parsing the form elements into CSV. Id define a schema of sorts that identifies the elements so the CRUD can easily work off one table. However this is an issue because sometimes these form elements change which can make it difficult to keep everything organized and clean. I also though about having a base form with standard elements, then forms that are requiring different elements would be stored elsewhere with some FK.p  pIm really at a loss as to what I could do to make this easier. I hate having several tables for applications, and several CRUDs for processing...p  pstrongTLDRstrong How can I best manage processingstoring several uniquerather large 20 so elements forms in a database and implement CRUD on them.p  pThanks for your time.p  pstrongEDITstrong I also just thought about implementing JSON or XML which would define the form elements and accepted data types. This could be modified by the system, and upon saving, could generate a cached HTML form page and updated SQL code for each application. That way, I can solve the editing problem. However, based on this implementation, Id still need several tables.p

Negative 1646 pMy original python program used string interpolation to take a number a user enters between 09999 like 2928, and summed its individual digits 292821, and then split the number until eventually it became a single digit number in this case 3, which was displayed on the screen. The code looks like thisp  pNow I am needing to figure out a way to do the same without using string interpolationconverting the integers to strings and then splitting the strings, reconverting them to integers, and summing them. I am fairly new to python and therefore can use very simple commands most complex being the while loop can anyone help me out throw me some ideas p  pps, I guess some ambiguity exists as to what yearint year is. year is a command that i didnt write above but its code makes the user enter a number between 09999.

Negative 1646 pWere trying to do low latency video on iOS while complying with Apples HLS guidelines for video over cellular.

Also, if you know of any approved apps that you believe are using HLS segments of 5 seconds or fewer, that would also be helpful since I can check to see if they are indeed using shorter duration and use that as a comp for Apples approval. p

Negative 1646 pIve got a grid 7x7 table of images. I want to autofit that tablegrid in to a fluid sized div that adjusts according to monitor display size. I want the table not to grow past the bounds of the div, neither width nor height, but take up the maximum area while keeping each table cell the same height and width as all other table cells.p  pI know this might be hard to visualize from my description.  Basically, all table cells need to be forced to an exact square same widthheight, but that size could grow or shrink depending on how big the display size is.

Negative 1646 pIn CRM 2011, notes get automatically created and attached to main record on lost focus event. Requirement is to remove this auto save functionality. Only till main form is open user should be able to edit notes. And newly added notes should only get saved once main form is saved. For example, if user add one note and closes the browser or do not save the main form, then that note should not get attached to main record, new note should get discarded.p  pI was thinking following solutionp  ol lipcreate new custom entity TempNotesHolderpli lipCreate 1N relationship with the entity where we want this functionality, for example Case entitypli lipMake actual cases note section read onlyit is requirement, user dont want to editdelete functionality for notes once note get createdpli lipWrite plugin for create event of Case and create one Record for TempNotesHolder and associate it with caseRegardingId field in TempNotesHolder  incidentId This will ensure one Case will always have only one associated TempNotesHolder record. There is no way in CRM 2011 to ensure One entity record will have only one record in associated entity i.e. 11 relationship. At least I dont know the way. Let me know if any one are aware about it.pli lipOn Case form, add one IFrame below Cases note sectionpli lipon case form load event, get TempNotesHolderId associated with case using fetchXml.There is no actual field in Case entity that refer to associated TempNotesHolder, hence need to use fetchXml. Some how we can add associated TempNotesHolderId to Case entity, and place that field on Case form, make it hidden, to avoid fetchXmlpli lipPrepare url to display only notes of TempNotesHolder record.controlsnotesnotesdata.aspxEnableInlineEditfalseampEnableInserttrueampidampParentEntitypli lipSet this url to newly added IFrame, so notes of associated TempNotesHolder get displayed in IFrame. It will also have link Add New Note.pli lipUser can add note to TempNotesHolder which are not directly added to Case record.pli lipNext develop plugin on pre save event of Case and check if there are any notes added to TempNoteHolder, if yes move those notes to Case record, and delete notes for TempNoteHolderId. This way notes will get saved to main record only on main form save.pli lipTo handle browser close event after adding few notes to TempNotesHolder, write plugin on Case pre Retrieve event, check if any notes present for associated TempNotesHolderId, if present then delete those notes. As notes are present on TempNotesHolderId, that means due to some reason these notes are not moved to actual case record and we no longer need them, so delete them. This will ensure on case load, TempNotesHolder note section always be blankpli ol  pThe above solution was fine till step 8. When I tried to add notes in TempNotesHolder, it gave me error, Record with  does not exists in TempNotesHolder. Then I checked that GUID, I disappointed to know CRM is taking IncidentId when I create note for TempNotesHolder. Then I tracked down the actual code for create notes to find why it is taking IncidentId instead of TempNotesHolderId.

Negative 1646 pI am working on a VOIP app on iOS. I have encountered some problems when implementing Ignore incoming ringer feature. It has the following requirements 1. Should stop ringer if pressed screen lock or volume button 2. Should stop ringer if mute button is pushed to mute state 3. Should not play ringer if mute button is in mute statep  pSince iOS SDK provide no information of the phones hardware buttons, I can only rely on setting AVAudioSession category. Before playing ringer, I set the category to ambient so screen lock and mute button can stop the audio. But this method cannot satisfy my requirements because app cannot play ringer when in background because ambient category cannot support background audio.br In order to solve this problem, I start playing the ringer in playbackandrecord category to make the audio stream come out and change the category to ambient immediately. Though it can meet my requirements, but this method caused many problems and bugs. For exameple, MPVolumeView cannot display the output devices correctly.brp  pCan anyone provide a more elegant way way to simulate ringer Or can this be done in iPhone  Since it will be in app store, I cannot use private apis. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 1646 pPlease excuse me, Im new to Python and trying to learn the Pythonic approach. Im designing a class that essentially initializes its state from a number of different sources files. Ive isolated this behavior to a single instance method, codeloadfromfilefilecode. Its called a number of times in codeinitcode, but I typically like to keep my constructors at the beginning of a class definition, and my internal helper methods towards the end.p  pHowever, if I were to take this approach, codeloadfromfilecode isnt defined at the point in codeinitcode where Id like to use it.

Negative 1646 pI am writing an application in WPF. I am using Entity Framework 5 and was wondering if you can give me advice about how to handle the following situation.p  pI have basically only three tablesp  pItem ID, Namep  pAttribute ID, Name, Typep  pAttributeValue ItemID, AttributeID, Valuep  pOur client wants to add attributes to his items and this seems to work quite well. Now he can add attributes and assign them with values to his items. First question To you think this is good design p  pThe question is now how to display the items in a WPF DataGrid and show all the attributes as columns. This is what we have nowp  pWe generate the columns programmatically p  precodeforeach var attribute in db.Attributes      datagrid.Columns.Addnew DataGridTextColumn              Header  attribute.Name,         Binding  new Binding  Path  new PropertyPathstring.Format[0], attribute.ID        codepre  pThis works fine. The question now is how to implement the indexer in the ItemsClass. We have one option which gets quite slow with large amount of data 20.000 items, 400 Attributes, every item  has 100 valuesp  precodepublic AttributeValue this[int i]      get              return AttributeValues.FirstOrDefaultaa gt aa.AttributID  i       codepre  pLike i said, this works but it gets slow. Instead of always querying for the attributevalues i thought of caching everything before showing like thisp  precodevar items  db.Items.AsNoTracking.ToArray CachedValues.Values  new Dictionaryltint, Dictionaryltint, AttributeValuegtgtitems.Length foreach var item in items      var attributevalues  db.AttributeValue.AsNoTracking.Wherew gt w.ArtikelID  item.ID.ToArray     CachedValues.Values[item.ID]  new Dictionaryltint, AttributeValuegtattributevalues.Length     foreach var value in attributevalues              CachedValues.Values[item.ID][value.AttributeID]  value       codepre  pI use a static class as the Cache p  precodepublic static class CachedValues      public static Dictionaryltint, Dictionaryltint, ArtikelAttributgtgt Values  codepre  pAnd in the ItemsClass I can then access the cachep  precodepublic AttributeValue this[int i]      get              AttributeValue val  null         CachedValues.Values[ID].TryGetValuei, out val         return val       codepre  pObviously it takes some time 15s to initialize the cache but then its a lot faster. Sorting the Items by a attribute in the datagrids only takes a second. With the other approach it tooks ages.p  pIm not satisfied with the solution, do you have any suggestions I would apprecciate any kind of criticism I know both are not good solutions.p  pThanks,p  pThomasp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pTo make the first question more clear an small examplep  pItems Item1,Item2,Item3,... Attributes Width, Height, Speed, ... AttributeValues Item1, Width, 100, Item1,Height,200, Item2,Width,100, Item3, Height, 200, Item3,Speed,40p  pSo its a classic manytomany relationship. A attribute might appear in 0many Items and and Item might have 0many attributes.p

Negative 1646 pI am having a puzzling issue that I cant find an answer for. I am trying to Upload a large ammount of data to a WCF service and it will return a 413 error on first and subsequent tries until a request under the 64kb limit is sent after that the large data request is accepted.  I have already extended the maxReceivedMessageSize and maxStringContentLength elements in my binding and the this fixes the issue when sending a request after an initial small request if these arent extended a different error 400 is returned not a 413.p  pMy system is an ASP.NET 3.5 application running on IIS 7 and the WCF service uses custom binding, SOAP messages and clientserver certificates. p  pBasically the order to reproduce is as follows tested on 2 serversp  ul liIIS7 worker process starts upli lisend request greater than 64kb returns 413 errorli lisend any more requests greater than 64kb returns 413 errorli liSend request less than 64kb returns 200 and valid soap responseli lisend request greater than 64kb returns 200 and valid soap responseli ul  pIf the maxReceivedMessageSize and maxStringContentLength elements arent increased the following happensp  ul liIIS7 worker process starts upli lisend request greater than 64kb returns 413 errorli lisend any more requests greater than 64kb returns 413 errorli liSend request less than 64kb returns 200 and valid soap responseli lisend request greater than 64kb returns 400 errorli ul  pDebugging suggests that when receiving the 413 error the server hasnt really initialized my service and once a small request comes in it is initialized and pays attention to my binding rules and then allows for large data quantities.p  pI suspect this is an issue inside the WCF library and may be fixed by upgrading but that isnt really an option and a need a work around. I was thinking along the lines of on application startup initialize the service in question some how or maybe increase the default WCF maximum received bytes somehowp  pFrom My web.configp  precodeltsystem.webgt     lthttpRuntime maxRequestLength65536 executionTimeout1800gt ltsystem.webgt ltsystem.webServergt     ltsecuritygt         ltrequestFilteringgt             ltrequestLimits maxAllowedContentLength67108864 gt         ltrequestFilteringgt     ltsecuritygt ltsystem.webServergt ltsystem.serviceModelgt     ltservicesgt         ltservice behaviorConfigurationServiceTlsBehavior nameELSLookupServiceTLSgt             ltendpoint address bindingcustomBinding bindingConfigurationTlsBinding contractLookup gt         ltservicegt     ltservicesgt     ltbindingsgt         ltcustomBindinggt             ltbinding nameTlsBinding closeTimeout000400 openTimeout001200 receiveTimeout001500 sendTimeout000500gt                  lttextMessageEncodinggt                     ltreaderQuotas maxStringContentLength2147483647 maxArrayLength2147483647 gt                 lttextMessageEncodinggt                 lthttpsTransport requireClientCertificatetrue maxReceivedMessageSize6553600 maxBufferPoolSize6553600 maxBufferSize6553600 gt             ltbindinggt         ltcustomBindinggt     ltbindingsgt     ltbehaviorsgt         ltserviceBehaviorsgt            ltbehavior nameServiceTlsBehaviorgt                 ltserviceMetadata httpGetEnabledfalse httpsGetEnabledtrue gt                 ltserviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaultstrue gt                 ltdataContractSerializer maxItemsInObjectGraph6553600gt             ltbehaviorgt         ltserviceBehaviorsgt     ltbehaviorsgt  ltsystem.serviceModelgt codepre  pMy Service Implementationp  precode[ServiceBehaviorAddressFilterMode  AddressFilterMode.Any] public class ELSLookupService  Lookup       serivce call implemented here  codepre
Negative 1646 pWe have two sites, one developed in RoR and other in PythonDjango. MongoDB is used as a data store for the sites. The sites are loginbased. So, users are able to see only their data and not of other users. Also, there are many models in MongoDB and these models are interrelated among themselves. p  pWe have to develop a search feature similar to Gmail search. In Gmail search box, there are many fields like codelabelcode, codetocode, codefromcode, codeattachmentcode etc for filtering purposes. If none of these fields is selected, then a normal search is done. What is astonishing is that Gmail search results are fetched in less than 1 second on 256 kbps bandwidth speed for any search query. p  pIt is not feasible to search for a keyword by calling multiple queries in all models. For solutions on crawling DB data, google search was looked up.p  pWhile doing a google search on search engine, there was a result mentioning about crawling and indexing web pages. The tools available are Lucene SolrNutch and Sphinx. But it is meant for crawling web pages and storing the keywords into db using Nutch and indexing keywords and searching them using Solr.p  pGoogling on database search engine doesnt provide any concrete results.p  pIn this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3215029nosqlmongodbvsluceneorsolrasyourdatabase32165503216550linka, in second point, it was stated that emMongoDB etc. seem to serve a purpose where there is no requirement of searching andor facetingem. So, does it mean that crawling and indexing on MongoDB is not feasible p  pIn general sense, is there anything like crawling and indexing on databases, irrespective of database tools MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB etcp  pUpdatep  pThe sites we have developed is very similar to Gmail, except that it is not about mail service. We just need to develop a search feature. So, Gmail users are able to see their mails, not others mails. Similarly, contents on our sites are specific to users. Hope it clarifies the problem.p

Negative 1646 pEven though my form is not set to be localized, Visual Designer puts text into the .resx instead of directly in the code if I have a label whose text is over 200 characters long.p  pThis is problem because I am using a custom localization approach that pulls localizable strings from the code, but it doesnt search resx files.p  pIs there a way to prevent this behavior I can just hardcode the string in my code so the extractor can get it, but this is annoying because the text looks wrong in Designer. Alternatively, I could use multiple labels, but that just feels wrong.p  pIve seen other people asking a similar questions in other forums, but no answers.p

Negative 1646 pWe are facing issues while disconnecting app from Intuit App center. When we do disconnect, our disconnect servlet is getting called but parameters are null. From the forums we understood that  disconnect landing URL should be OpenID enabled to get the information like realmId, username. In our case we are not implementing OpenId since  we dont want to publish in the Intuit App Center. So how we will get the details such as realmID of disconnected company when disconnect from Intuit App center. Is it possible to get those details without implementing OpenId while disconnection from Intuit app centerp
Negative 1646 pI was going to log an issue on the SQLAlachemy site, but before I did I just wanted to check I hadnt missed anyting. I have asked on IRC and I think this could possibly be a legit issue.p  pWhat it boils down to is the  filters are not taking into account emptyNULL cells.p  pSo lets say for instancep  precodeSession.queryTable. filterTable.column  1.all codepre  pNow I would expect this to return all records where the value was not equal to 1. However, what it actually returns is a list of records that have data in, that isnt equal to 1.p  pSo if for example column was a NULLempty value, it would not be returned by this query, to which I and others would expect it to be.p  pNow obviously its best practice to use NOT NULL on creating columns, but I just wanted to see if there was a fix for this, or whether its worth filing a bugp

Negative 1646 pHey guys so ive been trying to answer this question for hoursbr     Write a program that asks the user to input a set of floatingpoint values.

Use exception handling to detect improper inputs. p  pIve tried a few different things but i always have the same problem. Once something that   isnt a number is given as input, the program outputs the message prompting for another input however the chance is not given, that is to say after 1 incorrect input it prints that message and jumps straight to printing the sum.

Negative 1646 pI have some related question re video processing on iOS.p  p1 Is it possible to pause, then resume, an AVVideoComposition processing session  I ask this because Ive run into problems merging large 1080p video files together when my app is running in the background i.e., the 10minute background processing limit for apps.   My experience so far has been that the video processing session fails if the app is in the background when the 10minute limit is hit and the app gets stalled by iOS.  If I were able to pause the video processing session, I could detect the approach of the  10minute limit, then pause the video processing until the user brings the app back to the forefront, then resume it, etc., etc.p  p2 In lieu of the above capability, is there a way to extend background processing for longer than 10 minutes   My app does not fit under any of the categories of apps that are permitted to run continuously in the background.  But my need to do so for my app is legitimate and genuine  the reason being that  videos on the iphone are huge  1080p with the newer iphones  and processing them takes a while.  In a way, its not fair to users to limit an apps ability to process video taken on their behalf on the device the video was captured with.  Bottom line  an app should be allowed to either continue it to its completions, or pause and resume at a later time, as long as its in  the middle of an AVComposition video processing session.p  p3 If neither of the above options is available, could you please recommend a strategy for dealing with this issue.  I want to make my app rocksolid in terms of reliability and letting the user know exactly what is going on.p  p4 Is it possible to upconvert a lower quality video to a higher albeit fuzzier quality  For example  say I want to merge two video clips, one a lower quality and one a higher quality.  Currently, if I merge these two together, the resulting video plays at the resolution of the higherquality video  the portion containing the lowerquality video plays in a smaller video frame in the upperleft corner of the larger video frame, with the rest of the frame blacked out.  What Id prefer is to have the lowerquality video fill the larger frame, even if it gets fuzzy as a result. NOTE  I do want to maintain the aspect ratio of the lower quality video, however, so black bands across topbottom or leftright are OK.p  pThanksp

Negative 1646 pSorry to ask this ... its surely a FAQ, and its kind of a silly question, but its been bugging me.  Suppose I want to get the variance of every numeric column in a dataframe, such asp  precodedf lt data.framex15,yseq1,50,10 codepre  pNaturally, I tryp  precodevardf codepre  pInstead of giving me what Id hoped for, which would be something likep  precode  x    y 2.5  250 codepre  pI get thisp  precode     x   y x  2.5  25 y 25.0 250 codepre  pwhich has the variances in the diagonal, and covariances in other locations.  Which makes sense when I lookup helpvar and read that var is just another interface to cov.  Variance is covariance between a variable and itself, of course.  The output is slightly confusing, but I can read along the diagonal, or generate only the variances using codediagvardfcode, codesapplydf, varcode, or codelapplydf, varcode, or by calling codevarcode repeatedly on codedfxcode and codedfycode.p  pBut why  Variance is a routine, basic descriptive statistic, second only to mean.  Shouldnt it be completely and totally trivial to apply it to columns of a dataframe  Why give me the covariances when I only asked for variances  Just curious.  Thanks for any comments on this.p

Negative 1646 pIve been developing a website using JSF amp PrimeFaces. At the time of development, I noticed that therere 2 bottlenecks for any web applications. Correct me if Im wrong.p  pThe bottlenecks arep  ol lipIve used Hibernate framework for persistence layer. Now if a change occurs in database, then theres no way to reflect that in scoped beans. Hibernate has dynamicupdate attribute which helps to update only the affected records of the table [at the time of  persisting]. But Ive not found similar kind of mechanism by which I can always get updated DAO. Here, developer has to take responsibility of updating them by using codesession.refreshcode method, which just reloads the entire object tree from database table. So,for each small database changes, I think the caching functionality of DAO [in Hibernate] is missed since every time theyre evicted from session cache. In a word, database updates doesnt trigger DAO updates.pli lipAfter updating DAO, if I want to reflect the changes in view level, then I had to take help of Primeface sockets [PrimePush] since refreshing the pages every time isnt a good implementation amp primeface socket allows updating of specific ids. So, that means for each DAO fields, Ive to take help of many different Primeface sockets, each one having unique channel. Also sending messages to those different sockets has to be done by developer in bean codes.pli ol  pSo, the question is how these can be handled in a efficient way Is there any other technologiesframework which handles these issues so that developer doesnt have to worry aboutp

Negative 1646 pI have a list of 1 million slowly moving points on the globe stored as latitude and longitude. Every now and then, each point requests a list of the 100 nearest other points with a configurable max range, if that helps.p  pUnfortunately, codeSELECT  SORT BY computegeodeticdistance LIMIT 100code is too slow to be done by each point over and over again. So my question how should I handle this efficiently Are there better algorithmsdatastructures... known for this Or is this the only way and should I look into distributing server loadp  pNote this is for an Android app and the points are users, so in case Im missing an androidspecific solution, feel free to say sop
Negative 1646 pI got this problem when I start my projeect p  pIm supposed to write VB program which read and write data from every single cell from a excel file, my excel file contains about 2000 rows and 25 cols, and this number will vary from time to time its just a employ record file which will be more less from time to time but not change in a big scale but the reading and searching time cause the program to be lag, usually searching a item inside costs more then 3 seconds and loading all the data into the program will cause more then 30 secs, I havent wrote the writingintofile part but i believe it will cost more time.p  pIn my program I use for loop to go through all cells and same for searching , is there a faster way for processing this p

Negative 1646 pI have a class called codeControllercode, inside of which, I have a class called codeButtoncode.

Negative 1646 pIm trying to load a song at runtime using XNA Game Studio. However, it isnt in a .xnb format unless it was in the Content Project folder when the program was first compiled. As I want to retrieve the file from anywhere on the computer and load it with the Content Pipeline, I dont know what to do except for having the user put their song into the Content Project folder before they start the program. However, I was wondering if there was a better, more userfriendly way to do this. Also, they wont be able to put anything in the Content Project folder at all when the app is released as only the .exe will be released, not the actual VS2012 solution. Is there a way to load files at runtime without them being in the Content Project folderp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1646 pWere currently writing a Djangobased backend, that will be heavily used by iOS and other mobile clients.p  pWere using djangorestframework to provide a HTTP REST API.p  pThe API is used for downloading lists of products, checking on inventory levels, cart and payment, and sending back analytics data from the clients. Where possible, we would like to keep the products and inventory levels synced between the clients in realtime, or as close to realtime as possible.p  pWe do expect our API usage to be quite chatty.p  pIm curious  apart form HTTP REST, what other alternatives do we have for a transport that would handle the realtime sync well, and perform well to mobile devices many of which will possibly be on 3G  so both bandwidth and latency could be issues.p  pWhat would work in this situation And what issuespitfalls might we encounterp  pE.g.

Negative 1646 pIt seems to be difficult to find information about how to access depth and stencil buffers in shaders of successive render passes.p  pIn a first render pass, I do not only render color and depth information but also make use of stencil operations to count objects. I use a multi render target FBO for this, with color buffers and a combined depth stencil buffer attached. All of them are in the form of textures no render buffer objects involved.p  pIn a second render pass when rendering to the screen, I want to access the previously computed stencil index on a perpixel basis but not necessarily the same pixel Im drawing then, similar like you would like to access the previously rendered color buffer to apply some post processing effect.p  pBut I fail to bind the depth stencil texture in the second pass to my shader program as a uniform. At least only black values are read from it, so I emguessem its not bound correctly.p  ul lipIs it possible to bind a depth stencil texture to a texture unit for use in a shader program Is it impossible to access depth and stencil textures using normal samplers Is it possible with some special sampler Does it depend on the interpolation mode set on the texture or a similar settingpli lipIf not, what is the best fastest way to copy the stencil information into a separate color texture between these two render passes Maybe involving a third render pass which draws a single color using stencil test I only need a embinaryem version of the stencil buffer in the final render pass, to be precise I need to test if the value is zero.pli ul  pThe setup for the textures being used by the intermediate FBO is as followsp  precode The textures for color information GLCOLORATTACHMENT glTexImage2DGLTEXTURE2D, 0, GLRGBA8, w, h, 0, GLRGBA, GLUNSIGNEDBYTE, 0  The texture for depth and stencil information GLDEPTHSTENCILATTACHMENT glTexImage2DGLTEXTURE2D, 0, GLDEPTH24STENCIL8, w, h, 0, GLDEPTHSTENCIL, GLUNSIGNEDINT248, 0 codepre  pIn the second render pass, I currently only try to debug the contents of all textures.

Negative 1646 pI have a database table containing sets of items representing yearly recurring events. The record sets are stored by month and day.

Negative 1646 pNeed some feedback for an implementation that I am currently using...p  pI created a javascript file that is embedded into my website that sends a request every 3 seconds to an endpoint. This request has a unique identifier that is created for every new visitor. It then gets added to redis using some key like site123uniqueidentifier with a json encoded value loadtime189225. The keys have a 5 second expire time and since I am using a unique identifier per each visitor, it doesnt duplicate visitors, just increases the expire time.p  pFor our realtime dashboard, we are sending requests to our backend every few seconds and it does a get on all the keys matching site123. I then loop through all the redis keys it returns and run a jsondecode on it and add up the values.p  pWould this work with sites that get over millions of views a day If not what do you recommend as a solution, must work with ie7[xmlhttp and not sockets]p

Negative 1646 pI have a MVC4 application where employees can order lunch. The shoppinglist is then available for the person who goes to the supermarket that day. An administrator can settle the costs made each month with a salary. The central order model looks like thisp  precodepublic class Order      public int OrderId  get set      public int ProductId  get set      public decimal UnitPrice  get set       public int Quantity  get set      public int UserId  get set      public DateTime Date  get set      public bool IsConfirmed  get set      public bool IsSettledWithSalary  get set       public virtual Product Product  get set      public virtual User User  get set   codepre  pThis table stores the orders for every product that is ordered. The order does have a quantity for when people order more than one product, but in general it becomes a long table of orders and products.p  pAs can be seen there are two booleans in this table. An codeIsConfirmedcode and codeIsSettledWithSalarycode property. This is because people can make an order codeIsConfirmedfalsecode, codeIsSettledWithSalaryfalsecode, which can then be checked with what was available in the supermarket and the actual price codeIsConfirmedtruecode, codeIsSettledWithSalaryfalsecode and then finally the same orders can be put settled with salary by an admin codeIsConfirmedtruecode, codeIsSettledWithSalarytruecode.p  pThis last step now consists of adding a product called codeTransactioncode and setting the price to a negative value so that the balance of the user goes back to 0 and stores it in another codeTransactioncode table that looks like thisp  precodepublic class Transaction      public int TransactionId  get set      public DateTime Date  get set      public ListltOrdergt Orders  get set      public decimal TransactionAmount  get set      public virtual Order Order  get set   codepre  pThat gives an overview.p  pI did start with the project with this idea in mind of storing negative Transactions products, but looking back I think there might be more elegant solutions.p  pA friend suggested that I should be using more than one table for orders. Or use a table that links more two different tables together. p  pI have no clear idea how to do this though and considering the fact that it is not slow as it is, and it works, I would love to hear your thoughts on the database structure as it is and receive advice on how to proceed.p

Negative 1646 pIs anyone familiar with traditional Western musical notation code for HTMLp  pI am interested in I guess markup code being used in a standard capacity work in progress or de facto would be ok in HTML or XHTML, perhaps in the web. The closer to the actual semantics, the better that is markup alphanumeric writing of musical notes A, B, C... that renders in the traditional way as a stave and the musical notes and marks over it, and perhaps some lettering below in songs.p  pI am aware that music notation characters have already been encoded and that there is some work being done in Music Markup Language in XML.p  pBut when I have inspected the code for musical scores in webpages and even epub files, all there was in them were linked images. It would help me just inspecting the code in webpages that used a semantic approach I have been unable to locate any. It seems a bit odd that such an old and widespread notation system has not found its way in HTML.p  pI am not a musician, that is a sort of research for a relative of mine who is herself a musician.p  pEDIT TO MAKE IT MORE PRECISE The industry standard in Western traditional notation for music writing and editing seem to be Finale and Sibelius. Musescore is a well known open source alternative, and all of them are compatible by adhering to Music XML.p  pTo narrow down, I would be interested in existing software usable in an HTML or XHTML environment that displays in good quality scalable traditional music writing that is standards based to avoid proprietary software to process the code that uses a code notation that is as platformfree as possible to be compatible with major Western music editors eg, Music XMLp  pOne idea would be to produce a notebook containing several musical pieces scores for personal use in mobile devices, that can be read and used by musicians an individual piece should be able to be exported through a semantic code for sharing with others [who might be interested in making their own modificationsarrangements]. I would like it to be HTMLbased to achieve total platform independence.p  pThe best solution, I have been able to device is having the 1 Music XML code, 2 using a music editor to import it, 3 produce SVG, 4 insert the SVG within an HTMLXHTML framework. The code and the SVG require to be linked in some manner though a db or a link within the document.p  pThis is perhaps too specific, I would be interested in any experience or idea to accomplish tha HTML epub notebook.p

Negative 1646 pEditp  pThis seemed like a pretty good question and now I see that there might be a way more straight froward answer than what I just spent the entire day coding up.p  pI found reference that you can put this in the .htaccess file and the search engine will not index the pdf files.  Way too simple.  I guess this is not well known or someone would have saved me the 7 hours I put into coding up something near the one answer I got.p  precode    ltFilesMatch .pdfgt         header set xrobotstag noindex     ltFilesMatchgt codepre  hr  pI have a web site that gives pdf files away and is ad supported.  Lately Google has been linking to the pdf instead of the web page that has the embedded and the ads.  Seems crazy as they are Google ads but nice for the user I guess.  My revenue has dropped in half.  I can make the web results go to another page by creating a directory called .pdf and putting a file index.php with the appropriate header redirects.  In the new file I can rename the pdf but this just delays the problem to when they index the new location. Doing this to 700 files is not something I want to do every week.p  pI have considered translating the pdf files to html and have tested zamzar windershare, somepdf, intrapdf and none of them do a good job.  Some of the translations were almost readable, some just a white page, some a black page, one was a black page with some blotches here and there. I tried an online service a few hours ago and have yet to get the email with my file.p  pI am not set on pdf to html, it is just what I could think of.p  pPerhaps there is a better solution.  Others must have this problem and have solved it somehow.  Obviously I need the page searchable as well so just converting everything to images isnt a solution.  I dont know what to do.p

If either of the two lines is strongnotstrong commented out in the code then the cancel button on the search bar acts as if it were not even there.  Removing the codebecomeFirstRespondercode line means that I must clicktouch in the search bar field to transfer focus to it, so in this case when I click on the cancel button the search bar gets focus.  Its as if the cancel button is seen transparently through the search bar but cant be clickedtouched.  Take those two lines of code out and the cancel button works again.  p  pWhat the heck is going onp

This means that a user cannot scroll inside the UITextView because their touch events are being passed to the dark gray view in the back and scrolling that instead.  They also cannot select and edit their text on the top 3 lines.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQKLOO.png altenter image description herep  pI think I could do a workaround by capturing the coordinates of all tap events and checking if the keyboard is open and how tall the UITextView is, then selecting the correct element to receive the touch event.  But this is brittle solution that is more complicated with rotation.  Is there something Im missing in my autogrowing text view approach, or some easier fixp

But heres a query which I want to run using natural join p  precodecomm.CommandText  select  from friends natural join customer where usernameusername or frndusername username         ds  new DataSet         da  new OracleDataAdaptercomm.CommandText, conn         da.Fillds, customer         dt  ds.Tables[customer] codepre  pI am getting an error in the p  precode da.Fillds, customer codepre  pstatement, I think this is because I am trying to fill the data set with the customer table instead of friends natural join customer. but I tried that also,p  precodeda.Fillds, friends natural join customer codepre  pstill I am getting an error.p  pThe error I get is OracleExceptionUnhandled. It says p  precodeExternal component has thrown an exception. codepre  pI realize that you get this error when the query gives an error in SQL, but i executed this query in SQL, It worked just fine.p  pI tried changing the query, and it executed fine without the natural join, I am pretty sure that the error has something to do with the table with which I am filling the data set.p  pCan anyone suggest what should i write in the bracket.p  pThanks in Advance.p

Negative 1646 pI have 2 questions here for the code below. p  pThe first one is, how can I have an itemValue in selectItem for my selectOneRadio as a return value from a function I know this is working for a normal itemValue, if I put just 0, it shows up on the next page, but any of the getCaseValueByIndex returns nothing.p  pMy second question is, instead of listing each selectItem one by one, can i dynamically create them What I was thinking is creating a function called getCasesCount which would return the size of the cases array in this case, its 6 and then run a for loop like sop  precodefor int i  0 i lt casesCount i      ltfselectItem itemValueCustomBuild.getCaseValueByIndexi itemLabel  CustomBuild.getCaseKeyigt  codepre  pSo then what would happen is that would create the same code I have but dynamically so that If i added or removed items in my LinkedHashMap, the code would reflect those changes rather than crashing for an outofbounds or null pointer error.p

Negative 1646 pI was trying to seperate the group of windows per profile in Win7. I found out this is doable by creating a preference in ALL profiles of codetaskbar.grouping.useprofilecode and setting it to true and restarting browser of all profiles. a hrefhttpsbugzilla.mozilla.orgshowbug.cgiid644914 relnofollowhttpsbugzilla.mozilla.orgshowbug.cgiid644914ap  pBut how it works is it changes the defaultGroupId codeCc[mozilla.orgwindowstaskbar1].getServiceCi.nsIWinTaskbar.defaultGroupIdcodep  pThe problem with this is before this prefernce is created the Firefox uses the codedefaultGroupIdcode of the firefox.exe BUT after creating the pref profiles now have a defaultGroupId different from that. SO if initially, before creating that pref and restarting browsers, if user had codefirefox.execode pinned then it will always be separate after the pref is created and browsers restarted.p  pSo what I want to do is for the profile marked as codeDefault1code in profiles.ini I want to programatically make it use the codedefaultGroupIdcode of the codefirefox.execode but the thing is once pref is created and browser restarted I cant figure out the codedefaultGroupIdcode of the codefirefox.execode so please help.p  pMy last resort solution is 1 On install of my addon emif the pref of codetaskbar.grouping.useprofilecode IS there and set t otrueem, then set it to false and ask user to restart then on restart it will figure out the codedefaultGrupIdcode and store it as a preference then i will add the pref back then ask user to restart again really dont want to do this 2 On install of my addon if emif the pref of codetaskbar.grouping.useprofilecode is NOT there and set to trueem then just set the preference to the value of the current codedefaultGroupIdcode.p  pThanks Noitp

Negative 1646 pI want to install my C project WinForm .NET v2 on windows 7,8,8.1 without the need of installing the .NET . p  pAs i figured out, Windows 7 has .NET v2 by default and Windows 8,8.1 has .NET v4 by default.p  pSo I was thinking of copying my C project and have them compiled with both .NET v2 and v4. After that, I would make an NSIS setup with both of them using a script that could tell me which version of .NET is installed on destination system. Then just install the specific compiled project without the need of installing any .NETp  pThe idea is theoretically OK but the problem isp  pI found no one using this solution for their projects.  What is wrong with it Do i miss somethingp

Negative 1646 pIm writing a simple application where a Japanese character is displayed in the middle of the screen as a TextView with 4 buttonshome, shuffle, sound, and next on the bottom.  When the next button is pressed, the next character will be displayed in the TextView.p  pThe application works perfectly on the eclipse simulator and my Samsung Galaxy S2 Android 4.0.4.  However, on my LG G2 Android 4.4.2, every now and then maybe once every 30 chars, I get a blank TextView when I click the next button.p  pI did the following experimentsp  p1 I added some debugging code to dump the value of the character on a Toast before and after the call to setText, and the correct value is displayed on the Toast.p  p2 I pressed the sound button when the TextView is blank and verified that the sound button is associated with the correct character.p  p3 I added one second delay right after the call to setText to see if I was overwriting the TextView after setting the right character.  In which case, I expected the correct character to be set in the TextView first, and then it becomes blank after the one second delay.

Negative 1646 pMy question not obvious that it may look like, i want to change colour of rectangle view, that contain selected tab bar item. Not tint or tabBar colour, but colour of whole view tab bar item. Similar topic only suggest to change tint colour. I have 5 tab bar items and, when user switch between tabs, selected tab become red, for example. So, there always should be 1 red tab bar item and 4 blue.p  pI guess i can draw 10 different images for those tab bar items, and ask tabBarController to set different image for each one tab bar item, but i really hope that there is much simpler solution.p  pI have read through Apple guidance about tabBar, and sadly there is no way to change colour of specific selected item. Or maybe i skip something You can find this guide if you interested following this link a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationUserExperienceConceptualUIKitUICatalogUITabBar.html relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationUserExperienceConceptualUIKitUICatalogUITabBar.htmlap  pHow could i set colour for selected item Any advice would be appreciated, thank you.p

Negative 1646 pI have a springwebmvcspringsecurity application and I encountered a problem with bean injection. First of all, codeorg.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServletcode, codeorg.springframework.web.filter.DelegatingFilterProxycode and codeorg.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListenercode are all defined in codeweb.xmlcode, servlet context is called codeservletcontext.xmlcode and application context  codeapplicationcontext.xmlcode.p  pNow, the problem arises when I create my service, which uses codeorg.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.method.annotation.RequestMappingHandlerMappingcode. If I create this bean in codeapplicationcontext.xmlcode, no bean is found of codeRequestMappingHandlerMappingcode type. If, however, I put it in codeservletcontext.xmlcode, codeRequestMappingHandlerMappingcode is found, I can use my service in Controllers, but I cannot use it in other services, created in codeapplicationcontext.xmlcode.p  pMy question is how to organize bean creation in such application configuration. I feel like Im missing something simple here.p  pstrongEditstrong when application is started with a specific profile, a filter is added to the filter chain, which allows you to mock API calls. This filter is defined in application context, because thats where spring security is defined. It also needs to access a service, which can provide a list of all request mappings and our custom permissions associated with them and no, they dont translate to spring roles that well. However, this service needs to be defined in servlet context, because it needs to access codeRequestMappingHandlerMappingcode.p  pstrongEdit 2strong I produced a MWE probably shoud be Minimal emNotem Working Example here a hrefhttpsgithub.comguiltyseparatespringcontexts relnofollowhttpsgithub.comguiltyseparatespringcontextsa.p  pNow, theres an codeExampleControllercode and codeCoreServicecode. They are both created in separate contexts and need to access codeMappedUrlsServicecode, which in turn expects codeRequestMappingHandlerMappingcode bean to be accessible. Depending on where you actually create the codeMappedUrlsServicecode bean, you either get that codeRequestMappingHandlerMappingcode bean is not found, or codeMappedUrlsServicecode bean is not found. Heres a stack trace of when codeRequestMappingHandlerMappingcode is not foundp  precodeSEVERE Context initialization failed org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException Error creating bean with name com.github.guilty.spring.service.CoreServiceImpl0 Injection of autowired dependencies failed nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException Could not autowire field private com.github.guilty.spring.service.MappedUrlsService com.github.guilty.spring.service.CoreServiceImpl.mappedUrlsService nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException No qualifying bean of type [com.github.guilty.spring.service.MappedUrlsService] found for dependency expected at least 1 bean which qualifies as autowire candidate for this dependency.

Negative 1646 pI am looking at creating a djangobased website that will be have a few extremely different kinds of sections to it. My thought was that these should be separate apps, however I want these to be able to be brought across to different projects.p  pI am going to have a main menu system that is created from the database. I want all of these different sections of the site to be under this main menu system, and as such, have a standard header.p  pMost examples online seem to say that you should create a base.html template with the menu and then have everything else inherit from that. My issue is that this doesnt seem very portable as far as the apps are concerned.

Negative 1646 pI was wondering if someone can clarify why codeStringcode has been assigned such a privileged role. From Java documentation there are defined primitive types, objects, and strings. They encapsulated mixed characteristics from both object and primitive. For example we have primitive literals but string literal at the same timep  precodeString s  some string codepre  phowever, you can call a method from a string literalp  precodesome string.trim codepre  pbut you cannot define sth likep  precode2.plus2 codepre  pSo why String is so special What would be the implications if string was defined as primitive so we would have codestringcode and codeStringcode in order to be consistent with other primitive types it can still be final and immutablep

I have received a report from a user saying it also crashed in one scenario on their 5s, which is the same as what I was doing. p  pIm at an intermediate stage of iOS development and this is my first experience with diagnosing a crash report. p  pstrongUpdate Please scroll to the bottom of the questions for further updates on the issuesstrongp  pWithin Xcode, I have the following crash report for my app on my 5sp  precodeException Type  EXCBADACCESS SIGSEGV Exception Subtype KERNINVALIDADDRESS at 0x0000000000000060 Triggered by Thread  0  Thread 0 Crashed 0   CoreData                        0x00000001822f8af4 propertyAtIndexForEntityDescription  24 1   CoreData                        0x00000001822f0330 snapshotgetvalueasobject  304 2   Foundation                      0x0000000183080a78 [NSObjectNSKeyValueCoding valueForKeyPath]  288 3   Foundation                      0x00000001831613cc [NSSortDescriptor compareObjecttoObject]  140 4   CoreData                        0x0000000182305d9c [NSFetchedResultsControllerPrivateMethods insertIndexForObjectinArraylowIdxhighIdxsortDescriptors]  284 5   CoreData                        0x00000001823dd808 [NSFetchedResultsControllerPrivateMethods createNewSectionForObject]  492 6   CoreData                        0x0000000182305b58 [NSFetchedResultsControllerPrivateMethods postprocessInsertedObjects]  528 7   CoreData                        0x00000001823025f8 [NSFetchedResultsControllerPrivateMethods managedObjectContextDidChange]  2036 8   CoreFoundation                  0x000000018259b760 CFNOTIFICATIONCENTERISCALLINGOUTTOANOBSERVER  16 9   CoreFoundation                  0x00000001824e82b0 CFXNotificationPost  2060 10  Foundation                      0x000000018307a744 [NSNotificationCenter postNotificationNameobjectuserInfo]  68 11  CoreData                        0x0000000182301dd8 [NSManagedObjectContextNSInternalNotificationHandling postObjectsDidChangeNotificationWithUserInfo]  84 12  CoreData                        0x0000000182301d58 [NSManagedObjectContextNSInternalChangeProcessing createAndPostChangeNotificationwithDeletionswithUpdateswithRefreshes]  360 13  CoreData                        0x0000000182300348 [NSManagedObjectContextNSInternalChangeProcessing processRecentChanges]  2224 14  CoreData                        0x00000001822ff264 [NSManagedObjectContext save]  152 15  Lopey                       0x000000010004da3c [LopeyAddEntryViewController save] LopeyAddEntryViewController.m828 16  UIKit                           0x00000001855e50ac [UIApplication sendActiontofromforEvent]  96 17  UIKit                           0x00000001855e50ac [UIApplication sendActiontofromforEvent]  96 18  UIKit                           0x00000001855e5040 [UIApplication sendActiontoTargetfromSenderforEvent]  20 19  UIKit                           0x00000001855ce51c [UIControl sendActionsForEventswithEvent]  372 20  UIKit                           0x00000001855e4a40 [UIControl touchesEndedwithEvent]  580 21  UIKit                           0x00000001855e46d4 [UIWindow sendTouchesForEvent]  688 22  UIKit                           0x00000001855df36c [UIWindow sendEvent]  1168 23  UIKit                           0x00000001855b0b4c [UIApplication sendEvent]  252 24  UIKit                           0x00000001855aec3c UIApplicationHandleEventQueue  8496 25  CoreFoundation                  0x00000001825a77f0 CFRUNLOOPISCALLINGOUTTOASOURCE0PERFORMFUNCTION  20 26  CoreFoundation                  0x00000001825a6b4c CFRunLoopDoSources0  252 27  CoreFoundation                  0x00000001825a4de4 CFRunLoopRun  628 28  CoreFoundation                  0x00000001824e5dcc CFRunLoopRunSpecific  448 29  GraphicsServices                0x00000001881cdc08 GSEventRunModal  164 30  UIKit                           0x0000000185616fc0 UIApplicationMain  1152 31  Lopey                       0x000000010005a40c main main.m16 32  libdyld.dylib                   0x000000018f0e3a9c start  0 codepre  pI also have a bit further downp  precodeThread 0 crashed with ARM Thread State 64bit     x0 0x0000000000000000   x1 0x0000000000000000   x2 0x0000000000000000   x3 0x0000000000000000     x4 0x0000000000000001   x5 0x0000000000000074   x6 0x0000000000000074   x7 0x0000000000000000     x8 0x0000000000000060   x9 0x0000000000000020  x10 0x0000000100124540  x11 0x000000100000001f    x12 0x00000001001245a0  x13 0x0000000178242d60  x14 0x0000000000000034  x15 0x0000000004060401    x16 0x000000018a1c96e6  x17 0x000000018234e2d4  x18 0x0000000000000000  x19 0x0000000000000000    x20 0x000000017043b580  x21 0x0000000000000011  x22 0x000000017043c1e0  x23 0x0000000000000006    x24 0x000000018265d35b  x25 0x000000018f715000  x26 0x000000018f715000  x27 0x0000000000000002    x28 0x00000001780dbd60  fp 0x000000016fdfc850   lr 0x00000001822f0334     sp 0x000000016fdfc840   pc 0x00000001822f8af4 cpsr 0x60000000 codepre  pAs can be seen in the logs, I am using codeCore Datacode with codeNSFetchedResultsControllercode. I have a codeUITableViewControllercode that gets populated as a result of the user clicking a button in the codeUINavigationBarcode, adding some entries into a a few codeUITextFieldcodes and pressing Save. That is the point it crashed. However, I have to mention that it doesnt crash every time. In fact, before the crash, I had added in 45 entries consecutively and after it, I added in 100 with no crashes. It has only happened once. p  pThe point in the app where it is crashing is when I press Save which will dismiss the codeViewControllercode and return back to the codeUITableViewcode. With this in mind, it is either the actual saving of the codeNSManagedObjectContextcode, or its the loading of the UITableView. My money is on the former but Im not really sure. p  pHeres my code for the codeNSManagedObjectContextcode in the codeApp Delegatecodep  precode NSManagedObjectContext managedObjectContext      if managedObjectContext  nil          return managedObjectContext           NSPersistentStoreCoordinator coordinator  [self persistentStoreCoordinator]      if coordinator  nil          NSManagedObjectContext moc  [[NSManagedObjectContext alloc] initWithConcurrencyTypeNSMainQueueConcurrencyType]         moc.mergePolicy  NSMergeByPropertyObjectTrumpMergePolicy          [moc setPersistentStoreCoordinator coordinator]          managedObjectContext  moc           return managedObjectContext  codepre  pHeres my codeSavecode method in the codeApp Delegatecodep  precode voidsaveContext      NSError error  nil     NSManagedObjectContext managedObjectContext  self.managedObjectContext     if managedObjectContext  nil          if [managedObjectContext hasChanges] ampamp [managedObjectContext saveamperror]               Replace this implementation with code to handle the error appropriately.              abort causes the application to generate a crash log and terminate. You should not use this function in a shipping application, although it may be useful during development.             NSLogUnresolved error , , error, [error userInfo]             abort                codepre  pAs mentioned, Im fairly new to development and this is the first time Ive seen a crash log that needs investigating. Any direction in this would really be appreciated. Is it also something relating to the 64bit processor in the 5s Perhaps this would explain why I cant reproduce it elsewhere. p  pstrongUpdate 1strongp  pMy app is iOS 7 only. My 5s is only iOS 7 and Ive tested my app on iOS 8 but on a 4s and experienced no similar crashes. Also, Ive tested on an iPad Mini as well, so this is an iPhone 5s only issue. p  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pShowing the code that saves the new objects below.

The steps to reproduce the first time involved updating from a previous version of the app. I had the App store version on my device before the update, and when the update was released, I updated to that, created a new entry and thats the point it crashed. I ran the old version of my app, and upgraded to this new version in Xcode and when the app was upgraded and ready to go, I added a new entry and with an Exception Breakpoint, it crashed at codetransaction.dates  datecode in the Save method listed above, in update 2. The breakpoint was reporting codeThread 1 EXCBADACCESS code1,address0x60code. p  pI performed the steps again, without the breakpoint and it stopped at the same line of code with the same error. p  pstrongUpdate 4strongp  pThis crash only occurs if I update my app to the latest version and add a new entry straight away. If however I rerun the app before adding a new entry, the device doesnt crash. p  pstrongUpdate 5strongp  pWith some further testing, I have discovered that this crash is as a result of updating to this new version on an iPhone 5s and an iPad Air only. The app doesnt crash on any other device. With this latest version of the app, I have brought iCloud synchronisations. In the codeApp Delegatecode, I have the code below which will get run when the user chooses to select to use iCloud in the tutorial of the update. It is with this scenario that the app crashes. p  precode voidinitialMigrationOfLocalDataToiCloud          NSURL storeURL  [self.persistentStoreCoordinator.persistentStores.lastObject URL]      NSPersistentStore currentStore  self.persistentStoreCoordinator.persistentStores.lastObject      NSURL cloudURL  [self grabCloudPathCloudLogs]     NSString cloudStoreTitle  LopeyCloud      NSDictionary options  NSPersistentStoreUbiquitousContentURLKey cloudURL,                               NSPersistentStoreUbiquitousContentNameKey cloudStoreTitle,                               NSMigratePersistentStoresAutomaticallyOption  YES,                               NSInferMappingModelAutomaticallyOption  YES      [self.persistentStoreCoordinator migratePersistentStorecurrentStore toURLstoreURL optionsoptions withTypeNSSQLiteStoreType errornil]   codepre  pI have the lightweight migration there because the user may be updating from a previous version, etc. p  pWith an exception breakpoint set and even without it, the app will crash at the codetransaction.dates  datecode code in the codesavecode method, as per strongUpdate 2strong. Im not allowed to jump out of the code or do anything with this. Walking through the debugger, I cant see what the value of codetransaction.datescode is, but codedatecode is not nil. Even if I dont set a breakpoint, the app will crash at the same line of code here. p  pI hope this makes sense. p
Negative 1646 pI need to create a photobooth mobile application and decided to use HTML5 to work on my mobile application. Currently, I am using the getUserMedia method which works perfectly well on my laptop webcam. However when I tried to test it out on my phone as an mobile application, it could not work and all it shows is a video icon. Which leads me to find out that getUserMedia does not support in Android Browser.p  pI would still like to continue using HTML5 to get my photobooth mobile application working but how can I access the camera in my phone and is it possible to do itp

Negative 1646 pWith Xcode 6 I cant export codeipacode and codeplistcode like in Xcode 5 when export for AdHoc.

Negative 1646 pIve been writing up some android code that involves rejecting calls for certain telephone numbers and have gotten to the point where I can intercept the call coming in, compare it to a particular number, and then reject it. I am also using the SILENTMODE setting once I detect that its a number I want to block so there is no sound. However, the call notification still comes up on the screen for a second or two before the call totally stops. Does anyone know how to prevent this Is this even possible What about instantly transferring the call to voicemail message and then deleting the message I also suppose there may be a work around to make the screen go black but that would be a bad user experience.

Negative 1646 pNogotofail was recently released by Google and I want to use it to test an Android App I created that connects to a C server. p  pI read through the documentation and Im confused on how to use it. I have ubuntu running as a virtualbox machine on my laptop. I have the two android apps that come with Nogotofail installed on my device. I believe I followed the steps but Im not getting any results. has anybody used this to test and Android appp  pThis is what the documentation says on git regarding testing Androidp  precode    For testing Android devices we have included our Android client  ready to be imported into Eclipse. You will have to build the app and install it on your test device.      For testing you can use the access point nogotofail setups or  on devices gtJB you can use the OpenVPN setup and a third party VPN application to route your traffic codepre  pMy app connects to my server on my localhost443 and sends a message and receives a response from the server. Where do I point the nogotofail.mitm that runs on ubuntu Where do I point the nogotofail android app where it says host address p  pNogotofail just came out in November 2014 so there isnt much out there in terms of tutorials...not even on stack.. Any help would be appreciatedp

Negative 1646 pI have an array created in codewos.phpcode which I then codejsonencodecode and codeechocode to use in another file, codedata.phpcode, using jQuery.

This data is then used in codedata.phpcode where it is displayed in a bar graph using jQueryD3.

Negative 1646 pThere are a few tutorials and examples online that discuss making a mask for a custom shape dialog.  In C there is a hrefhttpwww.codeprogress.comcpplibrariesqtshowQtExample.phpindex145ampkeyQMainWindowPartialTransparent relnofollowthisa.  For python there is a hrefhttpunlogic.co.uk20110527shapelywindowinpyqt relnofollowthisa and a hrefhttpftp.ics.uci.edupubcentos0icscustombuildBUILDPyQtx11gpl4.7.2exampleswidgetsshapedclock.py relnofollowthisa.  p  pI have been trying to use an image as a mask, and based on the c example, as well as the qt documentation, I came up withp  precodeclass myDialogQtGui.QDialog, UiDialog     def initself, parentNone         supermyDialog, self.initparentparent         self.setupUiself          pixmap  QtGui.QPixmapbackgroundMask.png         self.setMaskpixmap.mask         palette  QtGui.QPalette         palette.setBrushQtGui.QPalette.Background,QtGui.QBrushQtGui.QPixmapbackgroundMask.png         self.setWindowFlagsQtCore.Qt.FramelessWindowHint         self.setPalettepalette codepre  pThis sets the background to my png file, but instead of transparency, the transparent parts are black.  As a check p  precodeprint pixmap.hasAlpha print pixmap.hasAlphaChannel codepre  pBoth print to codeTruecode.p  pIf I use only a region such as p  precodemaskedRegion  QtGui.QRegion300  75, 150  75, 75, 75, QtGui.QRegion.Ellipse self.setMaskmaskedRegion codepre  pThe mask works.  p  pHowever, from the Qt Documentation, setMaskp  blockquote   pvoid QPixmapsetMask  const QBitmap amp mask    Sets a mask bitmap. This function merges the mask with the pixmaps   alpha channel. A pixel value of 1 on the mask means the pixmaps pixel   is unchanged a value of 0 means the pixel is transparent. The mask   must have the same size as this pixmap. Setting a null mask resets the   mask, leaving the previously transparent pixels black. The effect of   this function is undefined when the pixmap is being painted on.p blockquote  pThere is no mention of using a QRegion as input for setMask.  It also seems that the transparent pixels black is what happens to me.  However there is no indication of why it is a null mask.  So I tried to find some more information on setMask.p  pIn the QPixmap a hrefhttpqtproject.orgdocqt4.8qpixmap.htmlsetMask relnofollowreferenceap  blockquote   pThe hasAlphaChannel returns true if the pixmap has a format that   respects the alpha channel, otherwise returns false. The hasAlpha,   setMask and mask functions are legacy and should not be used. They   are potentially very slow.p blockquote  pThe rest of the Alpha information isp  blockquote   pThe createHeuristicMask function creates and returns a 1bpp   heuristic mask i.e. a QBitmap for this pixmap. It works by selecting   a color from one of the corners and then chipping away pixels of that   color, starting at all the edges. The createMaskFromColor function   creates and returns a mask i.e. a QBitmap for the pixmap based on a   given color.p blockquote  pSo it seems I can replace codemaskcode with codecreateMaskFromColorcode.  However, there is no explanation of how to actually set the mask, as both these new functions just return a mask.  So if I am not supposed to use codesetMaskcode how can I set a maskp  pSince setMask works with a region, I assume my own issue is not solely due to the documentation saying not to use setMask, but my question is what the alternative is, so I can debug using a modern method. p

Negative 1646 pI am compiling a MinGW program on Windows in this case Windows 8.1 and I want to have signals for floatingpoint errors to be thrown.  For some reason I have to use codecontrolfpscode to enable these signals None of the other signals require something like this, only floating point errors for some reason, combined with a call to codeSetUnhandledExceptionFiltercode to get the exceptions so I can do things like get a stack trace etc...  On the version of Windows that I am compilingtesting on, this isnt a problem.  However, apparently older versions of codemsvcrt.dllcode such as the ones on Windows XP for example do not contain an entry for codecontrolfpscode, and thus cause the program to crash because it cant find this function in the CRT library.p  pMy objective is to make my program crossplatform such that, in the newer versions of windows that I am testing on controlfps is called correctly and I get signals for floatingpoint errors, and on older versions like XP, nothing gets called and we go on our merry way without EXCEPTIONFLTINVALIDOPERATION or EXCEPTIONFLTDIVIDEBYZERO exceptions getting thrown.. p  pIs this even possible  Is there some other way of doing this that doesnt involve not being able to throwcatch floatingpoint exceptionsp  pIve checked SO amp Google.

Negative 1646 pOkay, so I have an http server, pretty basic, which implements http 1.0, and it functions perfectly, except for a colossal flaw, when returning a zip file or it seems any compressed format, there is data corruption. What is confusing me is that there is only corruption when I call the writerHeader method in my HeaderHandler class, so when I do not call this method, and just return the request without sending response headers to the client, all the data is intact and functional. Another confusing aspect of this is that when I compare the corrupt files size with the good files size, they are both exactly the same, down to the last byte.p  precodepackage com.tinyhttp.core  import java.io.BufferedReader import java.io.File import java.io.FileInputStream import java.io.FileNotFoundException import java.io.IOException import java.io.InputStreamReader import java.io.OutputStream import java.io.OutputStreamWriter import java.io.Writer import java.net.Socket import java.nio.file.Files  public class Connection implements Runnablesoon try to implement http 1.1  private Socket sock private BufferedReader in private HeaderHandler handler private OutputStream out public static final String DEFAULTFILE  test.zip  public ConnectionSocket sock     this.sock  sock     try         out  sock.getOutputStream     catchIOException e           public void run     ReceiveRequest     ifsock.isClosed         return     RequestHandel   private void RequestHandel     ifhandler.getMethod.equalsGET         File file  new Filehandler.getRequest         iffile.exists             try                  handler.writeHeaderout, file.length, 200 OK,                                                               Files.probeContentTypefile.toPath              catch IOException e                  e.printStackTrace                                                             ReturnFilehandler.getRequest         else iffile.toString.equals  file.toString.equals             try                  handler.writeHeaderout, file.length, 200 OK, Files.probeContentTypenew FileDEFAULTFILE.toPathworks without this line...

Negative 1646 pWe have a project that behaves as desired when built using Xcode 5.1.1 iOS sdk 7.2, but when build using Xcode 6.2 iOS sdk 8.2 there is a rotation rendering issue on the iPad. On the iPad our app only supports landscape left and landscape right. When you rotate from one to the other, on the rotation animation the screen rotates from upside down to right side up, but when it does this it lands in the wrong position. The bottomleft corner of the screen ends up approximately 200 pixels up from the bottom and an equal number of pixels inset from the left.p  pThis may also happen on iPhone, but on iPhone we only support portrait so rotation isnt an issue.p  pOne additional piece of info, if I build with Xcode 6 but run on an iPad with iOS 7 there is NO issue. This ONLY happens when I build with Xcode 6 and run on an iPad with iOS 7.p  pHas anyone else seen then behaviour and know what the root cause may bep  pI found another Question on stack overflow where someone else has the EXACT same problem. Their screenshots show the EXACT rendering misplacement on the rotate as the app Im working on. Here is a link to that other question.

Negative 1646 pOn a Form I have two controls, A and B.  Each one sends an event when its value changes. The Form handles As ValueChanged event by setting B to some value, and Bs ValueChanged by setting As value.       p  pDo I need to do anything special to prevent an infinite loop, where the user changes A, sending a ValueChanged event which causes B to update, which now sends  it ValueChanged event, causing A to update...    p  pI know some GUI toolkits, such as Qt, have logic built into the infrastructure to prevent loops like that. See the Enter Your Age example in Ch. 1 of the Blanchette amp Summerfield book on Qt4. Some older toolkits required the programmer to define and manage a flag to detect recursion.   For WinForms, I havent read a definitive statement anywhere on this.p  pFor a concrete example, suppose A and B are NumericUpDown controls to show temperature in Fahrenheit and Celsius.  When the user changes one, the other updates to show the corresponding temperature in the other system.p

Negative 1646 pI found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq293581053258851a question somewhat interestinga, and went on an attempt to answer it. The author wants to compile one source file which relies on template libraries with codeAVX optimizationscode, and the rest of the project without those.p  pSo, to see what would happen, Ive created a test project like thisp  pemmain.cppemp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltstringgt include fnnormal.h include fnavx.h  int mainint argc, char argv[]         int number  10  this will come from input, but lets keep it simple for now     int result      if stdstringargv[argc  1]  noavx         result  FnNormalnumber     else              stdcout ltlt AVX selectedn         result  FnAVXnumber           stdcout ltlt Double of  ltlt number ltlt  is  ltlt result ltlt stdendl      return 0  codepre  pFiles emfnnormal.hem and emfnavx.hem contains declarations for functions codeFnNormalcode and codeFnAVXcode respectively, which are defined as followsp  pemfnnormal.cppemp  precodeinclude fnnormal.h include double.h  int FnNormalint num      return RtDoublenum  codepre  pemfnavx.cppemp  precodeinclude fnavx.h include double.h  int FnAVXint num      return RtDoublenum  codepre  pAnd heres the template function definitionp  pemdouble.hemp  precodetemplatelttypename Tgt int RtDoubleT number       Side effect generates avx instructions     const int N  1000     float a[N], b[N]     for int n  0 n lt N n              a[n]  b[n]  b[n]  b[n]              return number  2  codepre  pbr  Ultimately, I set codeEnhanced Instruction Setcode to codeAVXcode for the file emfnavx.cppem under strongPropertiesstrong strongCCstrong  strongCode Generationstrong, leaving codeNot Setcode for the other sources, thus it should default to codeSSE2code.p  pI thought that by doing so, the compiler would instantiate the template once for each source that includes it and avoid violating the codeOneDefinition Rulecode by mangling the template function name or some other way, and thus calling the program with the codenoavx parametercode would make it run fine in cpus without codeavxcode support.br But the resulting program will actualy have only one machinecode version of the function, with codeavxcode instructions, and will fail on older cpus.p  pDisabling all other optimizations doesnt solve this issue. Also tried codeNo Enhanced Instructions  archIA32code instead of codeNot Setcode as well.  p  pAs Im just now beginning to understand templates and such, could someone point to me strongthe exact details for this behaviorstrong and what I could actually do to achieve my goalbr My codecompilercode is codemsvc 2013code.  p  pstrongAdditional infostrong the .obj files for both emfnnormal.cppem and emfnavx.cppem are almost the same size in bytes. Ive looked into the generated assembly listings and they are almost the same, with the important difference that the avxenabled source replaces default sses codemovssmulsscode with codevmovsscode and codevmulsscode, respectively. But stepping throught the code in Visual Studios disassembly view kbdCtrlkbdkbdAltkbdkbdDkbd, confirms that codefnNormalcode indeed makes use of the codeavxcode specialized instructions.p

Ive followed a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsappsff431810vvs.105.aspx relnofollowthis msdn tutoriala on how to setup and use the accelerometer which Ive got working fine, and Im getting data when the phone moves.

The two ways I was thinking of presenting the data is through a graph, or somehow taking the collected accelerometer data and turning it into a percentage to show the users sleep quality the more movement detected, the lower the percentage  this being my preferred way, but theres just so much data collected Im not sure on where to start to achieve this. p  pSo, if anyone would have any tips or useful links illustrating how to take all the data collected and put it to use, Id be grateful. Most of the articles and forum posts Ive found have been dealing with gaming, or just showing how to setup the accelerometer. p  pThanks.p

Negative 1646 pIve recently started to dig into Laravel 5 and Im really digging it. heh, heh, get it ... Sorry.p  pAnyways. In my code, I noticed that, with relationships, eloquent does a TON of queries to retrieve said relationships, or load them. Im attempting to cache the results of these relationships, so that hopefully, I can reduce the number of queries down to very little, and instead pull from the cache.p  pIn earlier versions of Laravel, I know it was possible to run something like codeUserwithstuffgtremember5gtgetcode, which would retrieve the results and cache them automatically. However, as seen under the a hrefhttplaravel.comdocsmasterupgradeupgrade5.0 relnofollowEloquent Caching section in Laravels upgrade guidea, thats no longer possible.p  pMy question is, how should one go about achieving model caching now Id like to cache either the parent with all its relations, or preferably, the individual models themselves, and then check cache for them before pulling. I looked into adding an event listener to all queries via codeEventlistenilluminate.querycode that would check the cache before querying the database, but I dont really know how to return the result from that listener.p  pI feel like Im on the right path here but Im missing something. Any advice or extra information would be super helpful, thanks in advance.p

Negative 1646 pI have a force directed graph in d3.js Brilliant big kudos to MB and all involved. Id like to somehow be able to detect, and return the index of any node thats currently being dragged.p  pI know that I can redefine d3.behavior.drag to attach a callback to the drag event, but I want all the behavior of the native force.drag and it seems clumsy to reduplicate it all just to add this one little bit. In my inexperience, perhaps Im overlooking some straightforward way to do thisp  hr  phmm, yes, I should be more explicit. This is what I tried Ive used the example a hrefhttpbl.ocks.orgmbostock1153292 relnofollowherea as my model, modifying it to suit my purposes, and learning d3.js as I go. I defined the nodes thusp  precodevar circle  svg.appendsvgg.selectAllcircle     .dataforce.nodes   .enter.appendsvgcircle     .attrclass, node     .attrr, 6     .onclick, clicked     .ondblclick, dblclick     .oncontextmenu, cmdclick     .ondrag, draghandler     .callforce.drag  function draghandlerd     console.logd     console.logthis  codepre  pMy event handlers for codeclickcode, codedblclickcode, and codecontextmenucode, work exactly as I expect however, when I try to add an event handler for codedragcode, it never executes. I imagined that it was failing because I was using it wrong, or in the wrong place, or that because the behavior is governed by codeforce.dragcode, I would have to redefine that to add the additional behavior I wanted.p
Negative 1646 pI have a webservice that obtains data from Oracle CRM OnDemand.

Negative 1646 pWhen I first learned HTML, I was told that if you want to float 2 divs side by side using codefloatleftcode, you must set a width on those two elements. This is because a div, by default, is a block element, which will take up the full width it has available to it.p  pAs Ive built various projects, I have come across cases where floating did not work without setting a width, but then in other cases, it seems a width is not needed, and the float itself will restrict the elements width.p  pFor example, the following a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netflyingL123ytggLv2b relnofollowfiddlea shows two elements floating side by side only using the float property, no width was required.p  precodeltstylegt     .left         backgroundcoloryellow         floatleft           .right         backgroundcolorgreen         floatleft      ltstylegt  ltdiv classleftgt     Floating left ltdivgt ltdiv classrightgt     Floating left ltdivgt codepre  pHowever, in other similar scenarios that I cant seem to reproduce right now, applying the float property to two codedivscode does not allow them to float side by side unless a width is a set for both.p  pAm I losing my mind or is there some scenarios for which this behavior variesp

Negative 1646 pIve made some attempted to use formwizard but there wasnt much documentation about it so I decided to stay with the basic.  Ive successfully obtained and display the data from the first form to the second form and added some checkbox next to the data to allow user to choose whether to overwrite or ignore the duplicate data found in the backend process.  The problem I have is the second form doesnt know how retrieve the data of the first form after hitting Confirm button.  The form2.html template invalidated the data completely since it called itself again by the form action after submitting the data.

Negative 1646 pstrongHello all,strongp  pI am trying to figure out how to move my current system architecture based on modules wars running in Wildfly. Nowadays all infra resources are placed in JNDI tree, such as Datasources, JMS, etc... The framework for my projects is Spring 4 and family, which allows me to lookup those resources and other things.p  pMy goal is to create a microservice architecture using SpringBoot and Spring Cloud Netflix, where each one of those WARs would be a new independent application integrated by Bus service.p  pBut my doubt is, how to share those Jndi Datasources with all single Spring Boot applications, keeping in mind its not nice to have to setup userpassword for each application  datasource in each application.properties.p  pIs there any way to have a master Spring Boot managing all subprojects, because the great advantage is to have a application running in one port and other one running in another one, so if any problem happens for example Wildfly wouldnt stop all of them, for what now happens in my current architecture.p  pSpring Boot  Spring Cloud  single jndi tree for all projects  independent modules between themselvesp  pLet me know your thoughtsp  pThanks...p

Negative 1646 pIm currently developping a software which uses images. The soft loads them from the HD and uses them but it doesnt modify them. p  pConsequently, I have some Images instanciated into the RAM. In a particular case, I have to write those pictures on the hard drive but in a different directory than their original location. p  pActually, I do not know what is the most efficient way to do this. Is it faster to copy a file from one folder to another one with codeFiles.copycode or should I write my RAMloaded pictures into a new file using a codeBufferedWritercode for exemplep  pIn my opinion, writing a new file from loaded pictures could be faster because it doesnt have to read a file on the HD.

Negative 1646 pI am writing a game in XNA which is using Awesomium webviews as the UI.

Im considering to use other recognition service, like sphinx. It is so embarrasing, when OS version changes and your app will be wrecked...  Im aware about the fact, this API is not intended to be used for continuous recognition  as mentioned in documentation.p

Negative 1646 pI am working on a Python program that processes map data from Openstreetmap, and I need to be able to identify pairs of streets ways that are close to each other and parallel. Right now, the basic algorithm Im using is quite inefficientp  ol liPut all of the streets Street objects into a large listli liFind every possible pair of two streets in the list using nested codeforcode loops for each pair, draw a rectangle around the two streets and calculate the angle at which each street is oriented.li liIf the rectangles overlap, the overlapping area is big enough, and the angles are similar, the two streets in the pair are considered parallel and close to each other.li ol  pThis works well for small maps but with large maps, the biggest problem obviously is that there would be a huge number of pairs to iterate through since there could be thousands of streets in a city. I want to be able to run the program on a large area like a city without having to split the area into smaller pieces.p  pOne idea Im thinking of is sorting the list of streets by latitude or longitude, and only comparing pairs of streets that are within, say, 50 positions away from each other in the list. It would probably be more efficient but it still doesnt seem very elegant is there any better wayp  pEach Street is composed of Node objects, and I can easily retrieve both the Node objects and the latlong position of each Node. I can also easily retrieve the angle at which a street is oriented.p

Negative 1646 pPhrasing it differently Can multithreading under Unitys Mono result in parallelismp  pResearch based on Samsung Galaxy S5 and iPhone4S profilingp  pI tried spawning Unity3Dagnostic threads in C that carry out some heavier calculations hoping for a parallel execution and performance improvement. I reduced sync operations as much as I could, but I saw no frame rate improvement at all which makes me think everythings still executed on one core.

Negative 1646 pI built random forest models using ml.classification.RandomForestClassifier. I am trying to extract the predict probabilities from the models but I only saw prediction classes instead of the probabilities. According to this a hrefhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseSPARK6884 relnofollowissue linka, the issue is resolved and it leads to this a hrefhttpsgithub.comapachesparkpull7432 relnofollowgithub pull requesta and a hrefhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseSPARK9016 relnofollowthisa. However, It seems its resolved in the version 1.5. Im using the AWS EMR which provides Spark 1.4.1 and sill have no idea how to get the predict probabilities. If anyone knows how to do it, please share your thought or solutions. Thanksp

Negative 1646 pI am using an FFT to multiply polynomials. Because I want the program to be as fast as possible I am leaving away the zero padding. This means if we have a polynomial for instance to calculate 58  37x  238x2  155x32. Do an FFT on it and then multiply the array with itself and do an inverse FFT. After downscaling the polynomial will be 71478  78072x  53002x2  35592x3. This is a cyclical convolution meaning it is a multiplication modulo x4  1. However I would like to convert this to a Negacyclic convolution meaning Multiplication x4  1. Or universally xn  1.

Negative 1646 pSo I just found out about bootstrap today and started incorporating their UI elements in to my web app. Unfortunately, Im having a bit of trouble with their progress bars. I dont know if its just me but the they see to be jumpy, inaccurate, and stutter quite a bit. Heres a fiddle for referencep  pa hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netv255fwkz2 relnofollowhttpsjsfiddle.netv255fwkz2ap  pIf you click codeRuncode and then codeStartcode, at least on all my browsers I tested, the first one finishes a couple seconds faster than the second one even though they both should take 10 seconds. Also, the top one kind of zooms in the beginning and then slows down at the end. Its not the same speed throughout. Also the third one doesnt even work. It just instantly goes down after the 10 seconds.p  pIdeally Id like to use the top version because its smoother but in my app I need this to be somewhat accurate because its functioning as a timer for a user so Im afraid Ill have to use the bottom one. Hopefully Im just messing up the code somewhere or Im missing something. Maybe I should switch from bootstrap to something elsep

Negative 1646 pIve been developing a game using SceneKit framework and an overlaySKScene. The overlay contains a label and a few animatable sprites. Everything worked like a charm on iOS8.4.

Negative 1646 pI have a SQL Server 2012 stored procedure that returns a table. I have to modify that SP to add an additional value to the returned table. Unfortunately, that added value comes from a call to a webservice. From my research, I gather the main ways to do this are using the OLE Automation procedures spOA... in SQL, or a SQLCLR stored procedure. Given the security context in which the spOA... procedures run, the single return value is a VARCHAR10 registration key, and calls to the service are few ten to twenty per hour, Im guessing the SQLCLR method is the way to go. Also, the webservice is hosted on our intranet, and not accessible to the outside world. p  pIs there a better way to accomplish what I need Better meaning more performant, better security, easier to code and maintainp
