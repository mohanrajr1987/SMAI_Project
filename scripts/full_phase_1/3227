Positive 3227 pIm developing a NSE for our document management project. Im almost finished it but i have a problem and i couldnt find the solution yet.p  pFirst, Ill explain my scenario. There is two application in my project one is namespace extension, the other one is working in tray and its a simple gui for notification,history and ext.p  pBoth apps requires an connection, i use static class and static variable but those two apps using different AppDomains so i have two instance of same static class. Thats not a problem cause i create communication between them and its working properly.p  pThe problem is When my two apps running if i logout from gui app, NSE is runs logout method too. Consider NSEfolder is open and there are items in that folder, logout from gui app. After that if you go back NSEFolder windows want to refreshes item, cause of that i need a successfully connected connection. And if there is no connection, itll open an login screen. Windows is making asynchronous calls for all items. And i want to open login screen only once. So i used lock mechanism but when the code comes form.ShowDialog method first time, lock mechanism lets pass through second call. Lock works perfectly till the code comes showdiolog method. Its only happens after first call comes to show screen and lock only passes second call. Before first lock operation completely finish, lock doesnt pass third call. So it works but not correctly i want to. p  pWhen second call passed lock and came show dialog, first show dialog works and my program waits it. But after login it sees like nothing change and keeps open login form for all calls. Do you have any idea what should i use, or whats my wrongp  pMy code is like thatp  precodeprivate static object syncLock  new object      private static Connection con     public static Connection Connection              get                      if con  null ampamp TryConnect                              lock syncLock                                      if con  null ampamp TryConnect                                              LoginForm form  new LoginForm                         form.BringToFront                         form.TopMost  true                         if form.CheckAutoLogin  form.ShowDialog  System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult.OK                                                      con  form.Connection                             string message  string.FormatLogin012, con.Server, con.UserID, Globals.Password                             DriveBACommon.Classes.PipeHelper.Instance.Sendmessage                             TryConnect  true                                                  else                                                      TryConnect  false                                                                    if con  null ampamp con.Connected                                              con.Open                                          return con                                           return con                  internal set                      con  value               codepre

Positive 3227 pIn my application I use a codeReaderWriterLockSlimcode to synchronize reads and writes fromto a codelistltgtcode.p  pIn the following example reading the list is performed inside all 3 submethods, thus these 3 should be packed into a codeReadLockcode.

Thereby the code in codeSubMethod3code is not really protected by the lock.p  pWhat I have considered is to use a lock in each submethod, so codeSubmethod3code would have its own lock, which would be released when the codeBackgroundWorkercode was done.

Positive 3227 pI am currently working an c application that will work as the serverside of a multiplayer game and I am slightly unsure as to how I should be handling multithreading issues. Before I continue, it is probably worth mentioning that I am quite new to this topic.p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pOne of the requirements of the serverside application is that it should contain applicationspecific data, such as information on peers that have connected to the server, as well as their location and so on. The problem is that without some form of threadsafe mechanic, it is possible for two requests to be reading and writing to the same piece of data, which is obviously problematic.p  pstrongSolving the problemstrongp  pUp until now, to solve the problem I have simply been wrapping every request inside of a lock block, ensuring that every request happens in a serial order, so that data is only ever being manipulated by one peer at a time.p  pRecently, after doing some research on the topic I was introduced to the idea of a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiFiber28computerscience29 relnofollowfibersa, and a way of setting up a fiber pool, allowing the ability to queue actions onto a single fiber as another way of trying to ensure that requests happen in a serial order.p  pstrongThe questionstrongp  pMy knowledge on threading and these types of topics is pretty limited. I would love to know more about this topic, in particular I would love to know the pros and cons of either solution and ultimately which route I should be taking.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

Positive 3227 pWe want to prevent some concurrency issues in a database we use event sourcing and want to insert an event to the event log in case the event is a valid one.p  pThe problem is that we need to check if a certain operation is allowed requiring a SELECT query and some checks in php and then run a INSERT query to actually perform the operation.p  pNow, we can simply LOCK the entire table, do our checks and if they succeed, then insert and remove the lock.p  pThe problem with this is that it locks the entire table, which is overkill there will be lots of queries on this table. What I would like to do is to lock all queries that want to do this selectinsert operation for a specific codeobjectidcode, but allow queries for all other codeobjectidscode to continue as if there is no lock.p  pI searched a bit but couldnt find a lock attribute command. There seems to be a lock row command in innoDB, but its not really what we want I think Im not 100 sure what it does. We can of course try to manually handle the locks check if there exists some column with codeobjectidcode in some seperate lock table and wait untill there is none, but that feels a bit fishy and error prone.p  pSo, heres the actual question is it possible to lock a table for a specific value of a column codeobjectidcode It would be awesome if the lock only held for the specific SELECTINSERT queries, and not for standalone SELECTs, but that doesnt matter that much for now.p

Negative 3227 pI am writing a fairly large C sharedobject library, and have run into a small issue that makes debugging a painp  pIf I define a functionmethod in a header file, and forget to create a stub for it during development, since I am building as a shared object library rather than an executable, no errors appear at compiletime telling me I have forgotten to implement that function. The only way I find out something is wrong is at runtime, when eventually an application linking against this library falls over with an undefined symbol error.p  pI am looking for an easy way to check if I have all the symbols I need at compile time, perhaps something I can add to my Makefile.p  pOne solution I did come up with is to run the compiled library through codenm C Ucode to get a demangled list of all undefined references. The problem is this also comes up with the list of all references that are in other libraries, such as GLibC, which of course will be linked against along with this library when the final application is put together. It would be possible to use the output of codenmcode to codegrepcode through all my header files and see if any of the names corresponding.. but this seems insane. Surely this is not an uncommon issue and there is a better way of solving itp

The attributes   and modifiers apply to all of the   members declared by the   constantdeclaration. strongEven though   constants are considered static   members, a constantdeclaration   neither requires nor allows a static   modifier.strong It is an error for the same   modifier to appear multiple times in a   constant declaration.p blockquote  pSo now it makes a little more sense because emconstants are considered static membersem, but the rest of the sentence is a bit surprising to me.  Why is it that ema constantdeclaration neither requires nor allows a static modifierem  Admittedly I did not know the spec well enough for this to immediately make sense in the first place, but strongwhy was the decision made to not force constants to use the static modifier if they are considered staticstrongp  pLooking at the last sentence in that paragraph, I cannot figure out if it is regarding the previous statement directly and there is some implicit static modifier on constants to begin with, or if it stands on its own as another rule for constants.

So far, I have come up with a few reasons why this isnt the greatest approach, but is there something Im overlooking Why should this be avoidedp  ol liProbably the biggest reason I can think of is you need to escape your strings manually, and most new programmers and even some experienced programmers will forget this. It will work great for them when they test it, but then randomly their apps will fail when someone throws an amp symbol in their input somewhere. Ok, Ill buy this, but its really easy to prevent the problem a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.security.securityelement.escape.aspxSecurityElement.Escapea to name one.li liWhen I do this, I usually omit the XML declaration i.e. codeltxml version1.0gtcode. Is this harmful li liPerformance penalties If you stick with proper string concatenation i.e. codeStringBuildercode, is this anything to be concerned about Presumably, a class like codeXmlWritercode will also need to do a bit of string manipulation...li liThere are more elegant ways of generating XML, such as using codeXmlSerializercode to automatically serializedeserialize your classes. Ok sure, I agree. C has a ton of useful classes for this, but sometimes I dont want to make a class for something really quick, like writing out a log file or something. Is this just me being lazy If I am doing something real this is my preferred approach for dealing w XML.li ol

Even if I comment the [super drawRectrect] call in the method above, the cells will still display. p  pMy guess is that internally whoever calls the drawRect method for the tableview, draws the cells afterwards, meaning the overwriting drawRect is not enough because the cells will always be drawn afterwards.p

Negative 3227 pIm having the following problem, and would love some pointers in the right direction. To put things simplep  pI information from a table, with PHP, that I put inside a codeltselectgtcode tag.

If I click another one of the options it should show different information loaded from a database.p  pLike this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comx0PtF.jpg altalt textp  pClick on a category, show information. Actually Im supposed to have on the second cell another subcategory, but I believe that If I can get this first step solved then it will be a matter of applying it to the 2nd3rd cells.p  pUPDATE I am also considering using a frame inside that cell, a php document, that reloads everytime the user clicks on one of the options. Is that viable as wellp

Negative 3227 pOne of the things Ive been thinking about a lot off and on is how we can use metrics of some kind to measure change, are we going backwards or not This is in the context of a large, legacy code base which we are improving. Most of the code is C with a C heritage. Some new functions and the GUI are written in C.p  pTo start with, we could at least be checking if the simple complexity level was changing over time in the code. The difficulty is in having a representation  we can maybe do a 3D surface where a 2D map represents the code and we have a heatmap of color representing complexity with the 3D surface bulging in and out to show change.p  pOnce you can generate some matrics of numbers there are a ton of math systems around to take care of stuff like this.p  pOver time, Id like to have more sophisticated numbers in there but the same visualisation techniques used to represent change.p  pI like the idea in a hrefhttpwww.artima.comweblogsviewpost.jspthread215899 relnofollowCrap4ja of focusing on the ratio between complexity and number of unit tests covering that code.p  pId also like to include a hrefhttpbutunclebob.comArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod relnofollowUncle Bobs SOLID metricsa and some of the Chidamber and Kemerer OO metrics. The hard part is finding tools to generate these for C. The only option seems to be a hrefhttpwww.powersoftware.comem relnofollowKrakatau Essential Metricsa I have no objection to paying for tools. My desire to use the CK metrics comes partly from the books a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick0132398729 relnofollowObjectOriented MetricsMeasures of Complexitya by HendersonSellers and the earlier a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick013179292X relnofollowObjectOriented Software Metricsa. p  pIf we start using a number of these metrics we could end up with ten or so numbers that are varying across time. Im fairly ignorant of statistics but it seems it could be interesting to track a bunch of such metrics and then pay attention to which ones tend to vary.p  pNote that a related question is about a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1353013howwouldyoumeasurecodequalityacrossalargeprojectmeasuring code quality across a large code basea.

Negative 3227 pI recently acquired this book from Microsoft Press. I currently have Office Enterprise 2007 Access included and have firmly decided to convert my InformixSQL app to Access 2010. However, Im not experienced with VBA, Macros and several other functionality my app needs. This is going to be a new learning process for me, but I must modernize my 20 year old charbased app and take advantage of new features. I have begun defining my tables and columns, but not the relationships. With INFORMIX, I join a serial autoincrement column with an INT column in another table. Now when I display a customers master row, I would like to automatically display all of the transactions associated with that customer in a subform and have the ability to add, update, query, delete on either tables. Can this be accomplished with A10 p  pEDIT OK, this is what I have done so far, defined tables and relationships img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyoFSl.jpg altalt textp  pthere are more validation lookup tables to follow, but these are the main tables. So if now I create a form and specify the CLIENTES customer table, LOTES lot table, ARTICULOS item table and TRANSACCIONES transaction table it will create a CLIENT table as the master form and the other child tables as subforms on one screenp  pAlso, the reason I created a lot table is because when customers pawn or sell items, the pawnshop groups all these items into one lot, calculates the total loan or purchase amount, stores it all under one transaction and prints the ticket with a description of all the items and total amount. So I want the ability to say, if customer defaults on interest payments or does not redeem pawn, then customer forfeits all items and pawnshop may choose to sell some items to gold refinery andor transfer other nongold items to inventory to sell to the public, so would the above ER be adequate for this capabilityp  pI also want to ensure that every row in every table has the same storeID company ID while users are working within a specific company, as this system will be multicompany and there will be consolidated reports, etc.p

Negative 3227 pI was recently trying to change the version of rspec I installed from v 2.5.0 to 1.3.0 to work with rails 2.x.

I tried installing the other gems rspecrails and cucumber but they are now giving me this error as well. Even when I try to install the rspec v 2.5.0 which was installed before I get the same error. I can install other gems fine. I only get the error when I try to install gems that are associated with rspec rspec, rspecrails and cucumber. This is a real pain because I need to run some cucumber tests for my rails application. Any insight appreciated.  Adamp
Negative 3227 pI prefer using crypt function in php for password encryption and other one way encryption requirements. Because I can use any supported encryption algorithm, by changing the salt and there are few other advantages. Normally, I dont use any salt and it takes a random MD5 salt. I save this encryption string as password hash on the database, and while authenticating the user, I use this as salt to the crypt function. It works fine in php. But when its needed any other programing language to create a hash, while I am using crypt function in the php part of the function, we were into problem.p  pI would like to know whether is there any simple way to create a MD5 hash using PHP md5 function or other, which need to be similar to what crypt function generates while using a MD5 salt. If I can understand how it works in php, without using crypt function, then there may be a good possibility to implement in other programing languages.p
Negative 3227 pI have a table that contains approx 10 million rows. This table is periodically updated few times a day by an external process. The table contains information that, if not in the update, should be deleted. Of course, you dont know if its in the update until the update has finished.p  pRight now, we take the timestamp of when the update began. When the update finishes, anything that has an updated value less than the start timestammp is wiped. This works for now, but is problematic when the updater process crashes for whatever value  we have to start again with a new timestamp value.p  pIt seems to be that there must be something more robust as this is a common problem.

Negative 3227 pRecently I built a GUI app that maps a network connection to a drive in Windows. Unfortunately it uses the WNetAddConnection2 call to accomplish this. Its unfortunate because the Windows API sucks when it comes to Mapping remote WebDAV connections. It seems to work OK in Vista, except when trying to enable SSL, and it just doesnt work in XP unless you specify a folder You cant map it to the root URL. Eg a hrefhttpmywebdavserver.tld relnofollowhttpmywebdavserver.tlda. Also SSL doesnt work in XP.

Negative 3227 pso Im creating this android app that reads files. One feature that I want is to allow the user to enter a page number and then have the app open up that specific page number. Because Im new to Android, I looked up some information online and found some information regarding Edittext and AlertDialog. In my code, if the User opens the menu and hits Go To then an AlertDialog opens asking the user to enter a page number. I convert that string into an int, and then the app SHOULD jump to that page. However, for some odd reason, it only jumps to the specified page if the user hits GO TO again from the menu.

Negative 3227 pI have a custom entity, which contains FirstName, LastName properties it has other properties also. I bind this entity to a datagrid, which displays FullName LastName, FirstName as a DataGridTemplateColumn using MultiBinding with StringFormat. Users are allowed to sort datagrid columns and when they click on FullName columns, records must be sorted by LastName and then FirstName sort direction will toggle based on the number of clicks. I would like to know if it is possible to achieve the desired sorting multi column in the above scenario p  pI tried using SortMemberPath attribute but there I can specify only one column. p  pI Know if I add a custom ReadOnly property named FullName to my entity things would work, but I just want to understand if it is possible to achieve the same with MultiBinding implemented.p  pThanks, Pankajp

Negative 3227 pI have a comment and a question.  Entity Framework 4.0 does not show the linking table in a manytomany relationship between two tables, such as shown in Northwind for OrderDetails, a linking table between Orders and Products, if only two columns, both primary keys, are used in the linking table, as is often the case.  So in Northwind if you use as primary keys both OrderID and ProductID in the OrderDetails linking table between Orders and Products, for the manytomany relationship, the linking table will not show up if only these two columns primary keys are present in OrderDetails.p  pConsequently, you cannot Insert or Create in a manytomany relationship linking table, because Entity Framework 4.0 does not show the linking table OrderDetails nor does Intellisense show this linking table of the many to many relationship.  How is one to then do an insert or update in the linking table if EF 4 does not show the hidden linking table  Arguments such as you must now start thinking in OOP do not impress me.  SQL has a certain structure and OOP is just an interface for it so we can use LINQtoentities rather than the clumsier SQL queries, IMO.p  pThe trick to get around this bug was suggested for Silverlight here, a hrefhttpforums.silverlight.nett159414.aspx1 relnofollowhttpforums.silverlight.nett159414.aspx1a  , and it works for web services and any other .NET solution  simply add, in your linking table, a dummy column of any type.p  pNow delete your original .edmx file, and rebuild a new one by generating it against the actual database.p  pThen intellisense shows the linking table, and then you can Insert  Create and do other normal oprations.p  pFor example, Intellisense in EF 4.0 will now show the linking table OrderDetails, and you can create or insert such as partial fragment,omitting trycatch and any rollback options p  precode           using aDBEntity context  new aDBEntity                OrderDetails newOrdDetails  new OrderDetails         newOrdDetails.OrderID  some number here         newOrdDetails.ProductID  some number here                 context.AddToOrderDetailsnewOrdDetails                context.SaveChanges codepre  pQuestion is this lack of showing a manytomany linking table a bug or a feature of EF 4.0p

Negative 3227 pI have been experimenting with different approaches for pattern matching, analyzing, and predicting timeseries data. p  pSince I have no professional experience in data mining or related fields I came up with my own methods from scratch.p  pAfter a few months of sporadically skimming data mining articles the few that I understood I realized that my methods are very basic.p  pFor example, the way I implemented pattern matching is through a multidimensional kNearest Neighbor approach.  p  pI am just now starting to understand that there are common techniques such as Decision Trees, Principal Component analysis, Covarience matricies, etc that I should be utilizing.p  pI have been experimenting with RapidMiner, which is a GUI data mining tool.

Negative 3227 pI am implementing an image queue of sorts which downloads x images at a time. Suppose we have a page where there are 30 img tags , and I add the images to my queue from where images are downloaded 5 at a timevalue of x. So there is a queue of images to be loaded, and we replace src of the first 5 imgs to the intended image links. After one image is loaded, it dequeues another image from the queue and that is then loaded, this continues till all the images are loaded. This ensures that at a time not more than 5 images are being downloaded.br But this obviously slows the pace at which the images on the page are rendered. brbrI want to know if replacing srcs from a default img to the intended link is the fastest way of rendering the images. Ae can also have the case where we have divs in place of a default blank image and we replace the divs with the image when its time to load the images. Would this way be faster, or is the former method the bestp

At the end of my method to populate all of these text views Im using thisp  precodeviewHeight  viewPixelsToBeAdded viewHeight  viewPixelsToBeRemoved detailsView.frame  CGRectMake0, 20, 320, viewHeight realDetailsView.frame  CGRectMake0, 20, 320, viewHeight codepre  pviewHeight is the constant view height which is 1475. Im using codeviewPixelsToBeAddedcode and codeviewPixelsToBeRemovedcode to hold the total number of pixels that the view needs to be resized. When I use the above code... my scrollView detailsView just stops scrolling. Altogether.  I have my objects inside of a view. That view is inside of a scrollView.  Is there an easier way to go about resizing this stuff Why does my scrollView stop scrolling when I increase or decrease its height Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 3227 pThe a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryz51z7zy0.aspx relnofollowtf.exea is the CLI interface to the Team Foundation Server.p  pIn my case the complexity and structure of the permutations of the commandline switches is similar. There are about two dozen of different report types in a GUI app that I am trying to drive from command line I can do those things through an addin, and there will be about halfdozen different commands. I will start by implementing the simplest functionality, but then will add complexity as I have more time. This means that this will keep on evolving, and I will never know the exhaustive list of all possible permutations.p  pIn general, the cli syntax will bep  precodeManipulate.exe ltCommandgt ltReportTypegt ltFollowed by options that depend on the first two switchesgt codepre  pFor examplep  precodeManipulate.exe Open ABCReport option11 2 3 [option22 [option33 3]]  option44  option5 Manipulate.exe Open XYZReport option11 2 3 option22 [option3] ...

There can be a simple dispatcher which looks at the first two arguments, makes sure that command and report type are valid, and then tries to dispatch on this combination if it is implemented  can be found by creating the right subclass.p  pI think I would need abstract classes  that way the parent class can implement some of the common work. However, the dispatching in my case is not arbitrary as in a multimethod dispatch, but hierarchical, so I would like to leverage the power of OO somehow. If only codeReportOpenercode, codeReportClosercode, codeReportRefreshercode, codeReportManipulatorcode could be instantiated and had the knowledge of all its children as well as the ability to fetch the right child based on the value of just ONE commandline switch ... but then they cannot be codeabstractcode.p  pIs this a reasonable approach for this task or can you suggest something better What is the best library to parse the remaining third through last arguments, given the sample syntax abovep

Negative 3227 pIm using UIImagePickerController to allow the user to select a photo of himself to use as a player avatar image.  When I show a UIImagePickerController inside of a UIPopoverController on the iPad, and when I setAllowsEditingYES, I get a square editing area inside of the picker if the device is held in portrait mode.  But if I rotate the device to landscape, the cropping area becomes rectangular.  Is this the expected behavior of UIImagePickerController  Or am I doing something wrong  Is there a way to force the editing behavior to be 11 ratio or proportional  The docs seem to indicate that there is no control and that it should always be square When using builtin editing controls, the image picker controller enforces certain options. For still images, the picker enforces a square cropping as well as a maximum pixel dimension.p

Negative 3227 pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq6317367269126MSDN is a huge hierarchical doc site.ap  pTo be more precise, the content is organized in a hierarchical manner, but the URLs are not. The URL space is flat, making it look like everything is in the same directory.

Because that will be all of MSDN. Too much for your hard drive and bandwith.p  pBut you could write a script that looks at the DOM HTML to then follow and download only those links contained in certain navigational sections of the document, like those of CSS codeclasscode attribute codetocchildrencode and codetocsiblingscode, but not codetocparentcode.p  pWhat youd need would be some downloader that allows you to sayp  precodewebclientgtaddlinks xpathexpression   or webclientgtaddlinks cssselector  codepre  pIt shouldnt be too difficult to cobble something together using Perl, LWP and XMLLibXML HTML parser, but maybe you know of a tool that allows you to do just that so I dont need to reinvent it.p  pIt doesnt have to be Perl, any other language is fine, too, and so is a readymade program that has the flexibility required for this job.p

Negative 3227 pI am working in ColdFusion. Here is the issue I am having. I have a form with a number of fields in it, including checkboxes. The checkboxes follow a standard naming convention, for instance every check box is named chk then the name. So EMT would be named chkEMT, and so on. I am looping through the form.fieldnames and I need to get all the form fields begining with chk, then remove the chk from the fieldname and return just the remainder of the name, such as EMT. So chkEMT is parsed and returned as EMT the rest of the fieldnames can be skipped.p

Negative 3227 pI run a service that creates many SQLITE3 databases and later on removes them again, they live for about a day maybe.

Negative 3227 pI have a situation where I am loading many tab pages, but the tab pages need to have a collection of controls on them when theyre loaded.p  pThe way I worked around this was to create a new control  CustomTab  UserControl. This gave me access to the designer, but in order to configure a tab I still had to drag out a TabControl. So with the tab control out, I configure a single tab with all the controls I need along with a lot of user control and database logic. Then I include a method that returns the TabPage control.p  pSo in my main application, I have a normal TabControl set up on the form. Anytime I need a new tab, in the code I first make an instance of my CustomTab, then add the tab to the forms TabControl via my CustomTabs return method.p  pHow bad of a  design is this It seems a little strange having an entire TabControl to just host the tab even though the control is never used, but it just makes designing new tabs such a breeze have a template user control set up I just copy and start designing the tab.p  pAm I wasting any significant amount of resources And is there a more efficient way this could be done that would still allow me to design the tabsp  pBest Regards, John W.p
Negative 3227 pI am just playing around with a particle simulator, I want to use matplotlib with python and numpy to make as realistic a simulator as possible as efficiently as possible this is purely an exercise in fun with python and I have a problem trying to calculate the inverse of distances.p  pI have an array containing positions of particles x,y like sop  precodex  random.randint0,3,10.reshape5,2 gtgtgt x array[[1, 1],    [2, 1],    [2, 2],    [1, 2],    [0, 1]] codepre  pThis is 5 particles with positions x,y in [0,3].

Negative 3227 pI have what seems to me is a pretty convoluted problem. Im going to try to be as succinct as possible  though in order to understand the issue fully, you might have to click on my profile and look at the only other two questions Ive posted on StackOverflow. In short I have two lists  one is comprised of email strings that contain a facility name, and a date of incident. The other is comprised of the facility ids for each email I use one of the following regex functions to get this list. Ive used Regex to be able to search each string for these pieces of information. The 3 Regex functions arep  precodedef findfacilitynameincident      pattern  re.compilerSubject.fors.n     findPat1  re.searchpattern, incident     facilityname  findPat1.group1      return facilityname    def finddateofincidentincident       pattern  re.compilerDate of Incidents.n     findPat2  re.searchpattern, incident     incidentdate  findPat2.group1      return incidentdate  def findfacilityidincident     pattern  re.compiled3n     findPat3  re.searchpattern, incident     fid  findPat3.group1      return fid codepre  pI also have a dictionary that is formatted like thisp  precoded  001  Facility 1, 002  Another Facility...etc. codepre  pstrongIm trying to COMBINE the two lists and sort by the Key values in the dictionary, followed by the Date of Incident. Since the key values are attached to the facility name, this should automatically caused emails from the same facilities to be grouped together. In order to do that, Ive tried to use these two functionsstrong p  precodedef getfacilityidsincidentlist lst gt lst  Return a new list from incidentlist that inserts the facility IDs from the getfacilities dictionary into each incident.   fid  [] for incident in incidentlist     findfacilitynameincident     for k in d         if findfacilitynameincident  d[k]             fid.appendk  return fid  idlist  getfacilityidsincidentlist  def combinelistsL1, L2     combolist  []     for i in rangelenL1         combolist.appendL1[i]  L2[i]  return combolist  combination  combinelistsidlist, incidentlist  def getsortkeyincident str gt tup  Return a tuple from incident containing the facility id as the first value and the date of the incident as the second value.    return findfacilityidincident, finddateofincidentincident  finallist  sortedcombination, keygetsortkey codepre  pHere is an example of what my input might be and the desired outputp  precoded  001  Facility 1, 002  Another Facility...etc. input firstlist  [email1, email2, etc.] first output nextlist  [facilityidfor1email1, facilityidfor2  email2, etc.] DESIRED OUTPUT FINALLIST  sortednextlist, keyfacilityid, date of incident codepre  pThe only problem is, the key values are not matching properly with whats found in each individual email string. Some DO, others are completely random. I have no idea why this is happening, but I have a feeling it has something to do with the way Im combining the two lists. Can anyone help this lowly n00b Thanksp

Negative 3227 pI am building a module to edit a hierarchy of nodes.  You can think of it as a very large directory structure with many levels of nested directories and files.  The nodes for the hierarchy are stored in a relational database table.  The only difference is that there is no such thing as a folderdirectory.  All nodes have the same characteristics.  So a node has a parent that is also a node.  And there is only one root node, and a node can only have one parent node, so no polyhierarchies.p  pstrongTable columnsstrongp  pnodeid [bigint] not nullbr  name [nvarchar50]br  parentnodeid [bigint]br  leafnode [bit]br p  pThe goal is to figure out a way to edit the one hierarchy without users stepping on each others toes.  We either have to design a version control architecture to resolve conflicts, or else use some locking mechanism pessimistic or optimistic to prevent others from editing nodes thats part of an ancestry or subtree of some given parent node within the entire hierarchy tree.  If we perform locks, then everyone using the editor would need to constantly refresh their tree to see the changes of others.p  pThere are only three features to worry about.  Editing a nodeobject in the master tree is only allowed by one user.  Dragging and dropping a newly created subtree into the master tree.  Dragging and dropping a subtree within the master tree into another node within the master tree, thus making the dropped subtree a child of that node.p  pI dont see this architecture as anything different than an operating system architecture to manage folders and files.  How is that typically done with thousands of users on it  Id rather use locking mechanisms rather than using version control to make it less complex.  Im just not sure what the best approach is.p  pHeres my plan so farp  ul lipif a node is being edited, dont lock it until the save happens and the database is about to update the record.  After the database makes the changes, unlock it.  If someone else tries to edit the record at precisely the same time the database is making its changes, dont tell the user its locked.  Have the database handle the lock on the recordnode.pli lipif a new subtree is being dragged into a master tree parent node, lock the new parent.  Then insert the new records and update the root parent to point to the master tree parent node.  Then notify all clients to update their master tree.  So all locking is taking place on the database side after the drop happens.pli lipif an existing master tree parent node is being dragged into an existing master tree parent node, and becoming a child node, then we should lock the old parent becoming the new child and lock the new parent.  Then update the parent node of the new child.  Then update all clients all users and update their master tree.  So all locking is taking place on the database side after the drop happens.pli ul

Negative 3227 pHope youre doing fine.p  pI need a help a bit with this databasep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9L1tF.png altenter image description herep  pThis is a database that stores votes. Users pick the audio tracks they like, and they vote for them. They can vote up or down. Easy as pie. But, when it comes to the calculating stats it gets hairy.p  h1Metah1  pIts a keyvalue styled table, that stores the most commonly used stats just sortof cachingp  precodemysqlgt SELECT  FROM Meta   Key          Value    TRACKCOUNT  2620    VOTECOUNT   3821    USERCOUNT   371     codepre  h1Voteh1  pThe vote table holds the vote itself. The only interesting field here is the codeTypecode, value of which meansp  ol licode0code  App made Vote, user voted for the track using the UIli licode1code  Imported Vote from external serviceli licode2code  Merged Vote. Actually the same as the Imported Vote, but it actually makes a note, that this user is already voted for this track using the external service, and now hes repeating himself using the App.li ol  h1Trackh1  pThe track is holds the total stats for itself. Amount of likes, dislikes, likes from external service codeLikesRPcode, dislikes from external service codeDislikesRPcode, likesdislikes adjustments.p  h1Apph1  pThe app requires to get the votes forp  ol li5 most upvoted tracks during the last 7 daysli li5 most downvoted tracks during the last 7 daysli li5 most upvoted tracks during the last 7 days, votes of which were imported from the external service codeVote.Type  1codeli li100 most upvoted tracks during the last monthli ol  pTo get the 100 mostup voted track I use this queryp  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecodeSELECT     T.Hash,     T.Title,     T.Artist,     COALESCEX.VotesTotal, 0  T.LikesAdjust as VotesAdjusted FROM      SELECT         V.TrackHash,         SUMV.Vote AS VotesTotal     FROM         Vote V     WHERE         V.CreatedAt gt NOW  INTERVAL 1 MONTH AND V.Vote  up     GROUP BY         V.TrackHash     ORDER BY         VotesTotal DESC  X RIGHT JOIN Track T     ON T.Hash  X.TrackHash ORDER BY     VotesAdjusted DESC LIMIT 0, 100 codepre  pThis query is working OK and it honors the adjustments client wanted to adjust the track position in lists. Almost the same query is used to get the 5 most updown voted tracks. And query for task 3 is thisp  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecodeSELECT     T.Hash,     T.Title,     T.Artist,     COALESCEX.VotesTotal, 1 as VotesTotal FROM      SELECT         V.TrackHash,         SUMV.Vote AS VotesTotal     FROM         Vote V     WHERE         V.Type  1 AND         V.CreatedAt gt NOW  INTERVAL 1 WEEK AND         V.Vote  up     GROUP BY         V.TrackHash     ORDER BY         VotesTotal DESC  X RIGHT JOIN Track T     ON T.Hash  X.TrackHash ORDER BY     VotesTotal DESC LIMIT 0, 5 codepre  pThe problem is that the first query is taking about 2 seconds to perform and we have less than 4k votes. By the end of year, this figure will be about 200k votes, which most likely will kill this database. So Im figuring out how to solve this puzzle.p  pAnd now I came down to these questionsp  ol liDid I make the database design wrong I mean, could it be betterli liDid I make the query wrongli liAnything else I could improveli ol  pThe first thing I did was caching. But, OK, this solves the problem drastically. But Im curious about SQLrelated solution always leaning towards perfection.p  pThe second thing I had an idea was to put those calculated values to the codeMetacode table and change them during the voting procedure. But Im quite short on time just to try it out. Would it be worth it by the way Or, how do the enterprise class apps solve these problemsp  pThanks.p  h2EDITh2  pI cant believe I forgot to include indices.

Negative 3227 pI have a setup where my activity starts a service and sends values through the intent that control how the service acts.  These variables can change through the life of the service, and the service pushes updates back to the activity UI.  If I exit the activity and relaunch it, it will request an update from the service to get the current values.  This works fine if I relaunch the activity via the home screen, or if I use the recent apps menu.

Negative 3227 pI have a report which creates a list of Events for a specified date range and event type.p  pThe date range and event type are parameters defined in the report.  The date parameters DateFrom and DateTo work as they should.p  pThe EventType parameter however, which is defined as a list of values provided by a DataSet with Allow Multiple values checked, does not provide the expected behaviour when using the Select All check box.  If I select one or more Event Types by checking several boxes on the list, the report will show the Events which match the specified Event Types correctly.p  pHowever, if I click the Select All box which then highlights all of the other possible values, the report does not show the Events for all of these Event Type values.  It seems to miss out several of the values which are selected by the Select All box.  If I run the report specifically for those missing values, the report returns events matching those types.  This indicates to me that there is not a lack of data for these types.p  pAnd for that reason, it looks to me like the Select All is bugged...or perhaps cached somewhere  Ive tried deleting the reportparameter dataset and redeploying to no avail.  Its worth noting that this behaviour happens locally before deploying it, too.p  pHas anyone seen this before, or does anyone have any suggestionsp  pEDIT  I should also mention that the parameter in question EventType has no default value assigned.p

If I use thisp  precodesubprocess.Popen[sort, rtt, k1,2, input, o, output].wait codepre  pI get this errorp  precodesort multicharacter tab t codepre  pIf I use codeshellTruecodep  precodesubprocess.Popen[sort, rtt, k1,2, input, o, output], shellTrue.wait codepre  pThe process just hangs.p  pI would prefer using the first method, without codeshellTruecode. Any suggestionsp  pEDIT The file is huge.p
Negative 3227 pI have created a jQueryUI widget called Picklist using the widget factory. It works great. However, because it is a widget, it doesnt respond to the val method.p  pI have a function that is looping through an array to assign data to web controls. For the most part, I can just use the jQuery method val to assign the value. But that doesnt work for my widget.p  pI instead have to manually check if the widget exists on the control, and then call the widget version of val to do the assignment. This seems terribly inefficient and the antithesis of good object oriented design.p  precode    for var i  0 i lt ControlData.length i              var mapping  ControlData[i]           mapping.controlName.valmapping.value         if   mapping.controlName.dataErikPicklist                        mapping.controlName.Picklistoption,  val mapping.value                codepre  pIs there a way to have val map to a widget method on a certain element I was thinking there might be a method I could call on the element that would map the val method to the Picklists val method, but I havent seen any example of that sort of thing.p
Negative 3227 pThis is the whole Java class. The problem is when answerList.addposition, item is activated. if I change item to  then it works but if I send any other string it doesnt work.

When it finds the link, it needs to visit  click the link so that I can see the source code of the new website for other works later.

Needless to say, this is extremely annoying as it breaks the Chef runs everything in order from top to bottom that i was promised when i started using it. However, i am not very picky so i started looking for alternative solutions to this problem, sop  pProblem B ive run across the idea of rubyblock. apparently, this is a resource so it will be evaluated along with the other resources.

So, in this case the result will look like thisp  precodeattr72195   attr72196   20130731    a             20130730    c             20130729    d             20130728    NULL           codepre  pI want to get value per row. Now my working query looks like thisp  precodeSELECT f1.attr72195, t.attr72198 AS attr72196  FROM object72194 f1  LEFT OUTER JOIN    SELECT id, attr72198, attr72199 FROM object72197 t   AS t ON t.attr72199 lt f1.attr72195  WHERE  f1.idobj  72194  AND t.attr72199    SELECT MAXattr72199 FROM object72197 t   WHERE attr72199 lt f1.attr72195  OR t.attr72199 IS NULL codepre  p ORDER BY f1.idorder DESCp  pIt works as expected. But it does not seem to be quite optimal because of the subquery in the last codeWHEREcode block. One programmer advised me to use one more join with grouping instead, but I just do not know how. Thank youp  pEDIT Removed unnecessary ordering inside subqueries and checked both queries mine and with joins instead of a subquery and got interesting result. EXPLAIN returned five rows for the version with a subquery and four rows for the version with joins id column. In rows column I got 13 rows for the subquery version and 18 rows in total for join version. So, have to check against large data to decide what version to use.p  pEDIT Oh, this query with joins turned out to be incorrect, because it groups results by the column p  pEDIT The question is still open. The problem appears when there are duplicates in the second table. As a result, both queries return as many rows as in the second table. But I need just a value per row. Just as I showed from the very first in the example with values a, b, c and d.p  pEDIT Finally, I did it. I added grouping by unique field in the first table and returned the previous grouping. So the query now looks like thisp  precodeSELECT f1.attr72195, f2.attr72198 AS attr72196  FROM object72194 f1 INNER JOIN    SELECT f1.attr72195, MAXf2.attr72199 AS attr72199  FROM object72194 f1   LEFT OUTER JOIN object72197 f2 ON f1.attr72195 gt f2.attr72199  GROUP BY f1.attr72195  o ON f1.attr72195  o.attr72195 LEFT OUTER JOIN object72197 f2 ON f2.attr72199  o.attr72199 GROUP BY f1.id, attr72195 ORDER BY f1.idorder DESC codepre  pSimple and elegant. p

Negative 3227 pI am new to crosscompilation. I have to crosscompile a Linux kernel because I intend to use a wifi module with my TS7500 SBC ARM processor and it does not support it. I have the drivers for my wifi module and through internet surfing I have come to know a general procedure of crosscompilation. However I am somewhat confused on the extra module portion. Here is the information from official website of TS7500 regarding these extra modulesp  pstrongAppendix  Compiling TSKernel with Custom Optionsstrong In order to compile a separate kernel module and come out with a .ko file for inclusion in the already existing kernel, these are the steps to take following step 08 and ending at step 09 above. Note Steps after step 02 are unverifieduntested. They represent an accurate procedure which one would go through.p  p01. Open menuconfig and modularize the kernel feature using M.  For          example, to modularize cifs.ko, one would use the arrow and Enter keys          to navigate to Filesystems  Network File Systems  CIFS Support.br         Press M to modularize CIFS support into the kernel then keep hitting          exit until youre prompted to save changes, choose yes.p  precodemake menuconfig codepre  p02. Compile the kernel with the modules and copy the modules to the Linux PCp  precode make ampamp make modules ampamp make modulesinstall   codepre  p03. Retrieve the module which was copied to the Linux PC with a command like         cp so that it can be installed into the kernel on the MiniSD card.p  precodemkdir mntminiSD4 mount devsdb4 mntminiSD4 cp libmodules2.6.24.4kernelfscifscifs.ko mntminiSD4 codepre  p04. Install the module into the kernel by copy and pasting from partition 4          of the card to partition 2 on the SBC.p  precodecp r devnbd4cifs.ko devnbd2libmodules2.6.24.4kernelfscifscifs.ko codepre  p05. Finally, in order to use the new module, you must enable it.  This can           be included in a startup script such as linuxrc.p  precodedepmod modprobe cifs.ko codepre  pI am confused about serial 2.

Negative 3227 pAlright, so I have spend LITERALLY five or six hours working on this to no avail. Im working in C with ASP.NET MVC 4 and EF 5.0, I believe. Heres my problem I have a method in my controller takes a custom class as a parameter these names have been candythemed obfuscated P. The ViewError class looks like sop  precodepublic class ViewErrorltTgt where T  class      public T ModelObject  get set      public string Message  get set       public ViewErrorstring message, T modelObject              Message  message         ModelObject  modelObject           public ViewError              Message  null         ModelObject  defaultT       codepre  pIts a generic so I can figure out what type the ModelObject is from within the code. Its irrelevant, though Ive already tested it taking a generic object and the same problem happens.p  pThe controller method looks like this. All it does is ask who is eating the candy, and if theres a ViewError, it displays the message. The view has a paragraph that displays the ViewBag.Message.p  precodepublic ActionResult EatCandyViewErrorltEatCandyViewModelgt error      ViewBag.BrandList  new SelectListdb.Brands, ID, Name      If theres a notification, pass it to the view, along with the model     iferror.Message  null              ViewBag.Message  error.Message         return Viewerror.ModelObject          return View  codepre  pOn the postp  precode[HttpPost] public ActionResult EatCandyEatCandyViewModel viewModel      ifModelState.IsValid              CandyEater eater  CandyEaterviewModel         db.CandyEaters.Addeater         db.SaveDatabase  Custom convenience wrapper for SaveChanges         return RedirectToActionChooseCandyToEat, eater          return ViewviewModel  codepre  pPretty standard stuff. Now, in the ChooseCandyToEat method, it brings up a list of candy available to eat of a specific brand. If that brand doesnt have any available candy, I want it to send an error back to the EatCandy method via ViewError object telling that eater that they have no candy to eat, and send the model back so that the eater doesnt have to type in their info again, merely select a different brand of candy.p  precodepublic ActionResult ChooseCandyToEatCandyEater eater       Get the list of candy associated with the brand.     IEnumerableltCandygt candyList  db.Candies.Whereb gt b.Brand  eater.DesiredBrand                                              .Wheree gt e.Eaten      If the brand has no candy, return an error message to the view     ifcandyList.Count  0              EatCandyViewModel viewModel  EatCandyViewModeleater         ViewErrorltEatCandyViewModelgt viewError  new ViewErrorltEatCandyViewModelgtOh noes That brand has no candy to eat, viewModel.Clone  This is a deep clone, but even if it wasnt, it would still be weird. Keep reading.         return RedirectToActionEatCandy, viewError          return ViewcandyList  codepre  pAccording to my understanding, this should all work. Now heres the weird part  I can confirm, through debug messages and the Watch window using Visual Studio that the ViewError is created properly and holds a deep clone of the viewModel in its ModelObject I have to convert it back because the EatCandy method expects an EatCandyViewModel as a parameter. However, when I step forward and the ViewError is passed to EatCandy, the ModelObject within it is null I originally thought this was because it only passed a reference of viewModel into the object and it was getting garbage collected, which is why I added the Clone method. The string, which is also a reference type, is getting through okay, though. Why isnt the object Does anyone knowp  pIf you need more info, just ask. And disregard the ridiculousness of this database  I obfuscated it intentionally, not just to be silly.p

Negative 3227 pIm working on a 2D game in which the terrain can vary and is composed of any shape of polygons except for self intersecting ones. The player collision box is in the shape of a square and can move about. My question is this How do I keep an alwaysupright box to collide with variable terrain and always stay outsidep  pMy current approach that I made up albeit no code yet works like the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com66Zc1.png altprototypep  pThe blue square is the player hitbox. First, it moves with a velocity downwards as an example. My goal is to find the heighest point in its travel path where it can be safely outside of the terrain polygon. I test all the terrain vertex points inside its travel path and project them to the velocity of the box. I take the farthest projection.p  pThe farthest projection will be the max distance allowed to move in without going into the terrain.p  pMove the square by distance in the direction of velocity and done.p  pHowever, there are few scenarios that I encountered where this does not work. Take this as an examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTmLqK.png altFailure of algorithmp  pTo remedy this situation, I now test for one corner of the square. If the distance from the corner is shorter than the farthest projection, then that distance will give the appropriate shift in distance. This pretty much makes the algorithm fullproof. Unless someone states another exception.p  pIm going a little crazy and I would appreciate feedback on my algorithm. If anyone has any suggestions or good reads about 2D upright box collisions on terrain or anything similar, that would be great.p

Negative 3227 pI am almost 100 sure my problem is caused when adding an nvarchar value as my search key to the parameterized query. The problem arises that if I have apostrophes surrounding codeexpcode which is meant to be my place holder the query is interpreted as exp being my search key rather than a place holder. I would remove the apostrophes except that the query is not syntactically correct unless the search key is surrounded by apostrophes. It has been explained to me that I cannot just add the apostrophes to the value being inserted into the parameter because the execution plan has already been evaluated and the search key value will literally be Spanish rather than Spanish. My Question is how do I get around this. Please see the explanation below for a more extensive background on the issue.p  pAs the title states I have two dynamic queries one using parameterization and one not, both queries are meant to do the exact same thing. The queries are used to return the number of members that have Primary or Secondary Experience in a particular language.p  pThat being said the queries are setup like this.

Negative 3227 pRecently I started working with sockets. I realized that when reading from a network stream, you can not know how much data is coming in. So either you know in advance stronghow many bytesstrong have to be recieved or you know strongwhich bytesstrong.p  pSince I am currently trying to implement a C a hrefhttptools.ietf.orghtmlrfc6455 relnofollowWebSocketa server I need to process HTTP requests. A HTTP request can have arbitrary length, so knowing in advance emhow many bytesem is out of the question. But a HTTP request always has a a hrefhttptools.ietf.orghtmlrfc2616 relnofollowcertain formata. It starts with the requestline, followed by zero or more headers, etc. So with all this information it should be simple, rightp  pNope.p  pOne approach I came up with was reading all data until a specific sequence of bytes was recognized. The a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.io.streamreader.aspx relnofollowStreamReader classa has the codeReadLinecode method which, I believe, works like this. For HTTP a reasonable delimiter would be the emempty lineem separating the message head from the body.p  pThe obvious problem here is the requirement of a preferrably short termination sequence, like a line break. Even the HTTP specification suggests that these two adjacent CRLFs are not a good choice, since they could also occur at the beginning of the message. And after all, two CRLFs are not a simple delimiter anyways.p  pSo expanding the method to arbitrary type3 grammars, I concluded the best choice for parsing the data is a finite state machine. I can feed the data to the machine byte after byte, just as I am reading it from the network stream. And as soon as the machine accepts the input I can stop reading data. Also, the FSM could immediately capture the significant tokens.p  pBut is this really the best solution Reading byte after byte and validating it with a custom parser seems tedious and expensive. And the FSM would be either slow or quite ugly. So...p  pstrongHow do you process data from a network stream when the form is known but not the sizestrongp  pstrongHow can classes like the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.net.httplistener.aspx relnofollowHttpListenera parse the messages and be fast at it toostrongp  pDid I miss something here How would this usually be donep

Negative 3227 pIve been banging my head in this morning trying to solve a task I cant believe no one has wanted to do before  that being to copy a directory of files amp subdirs amp all files over to another location but strictly copying the BIGGEST files first. Why Because, from what I can see, this will help stop fragmenting big files being copied to USB flash memory due to the way it seems to copy the file then move it, leaving a gap the size of the file. Bigger files cant fit in that gap so make their own. ETc etc. End result  biggest first SHOULD hopefully mean 1 gap used for all copies and the resulting files all lined up contiguously after it.  Im not anally retentive about fragmented files, its to get contiguous files on a USB like isosimages.p  pSo this is what Ive got so far  2 problems to fix   1  only 1 level of directory is made on the destination path if it doesnt exist  I need it to make as many as necessary that dont exist yet  2  when the first copy starts it says not enough space even though there is like 30g left on this device to copy a 4g file.p  pAll input welcomep  precodestrPath  CDataImages strDestPath  E Set DataList  CreateObjectADODB.Recordset DataList.Fields.Append strFilePath, 200, 255  adVarChar DataList.Fields.Append strFileName, 200, 255  adVarChar DataList.Fields.Append strFileSize, 3, 4  adDouble DataList.Open  Set objFSO  CreateObjectScripting.FileSystemObject Set objFolder  objFSO.GetFolderstrPath  If RightstrPath, 1   Then strPath  LeftstrPath, LenstrPath  1 If RightstrDestPath, 1   Then strDestPath  LeftstrDestPath, LenstrDestPath  1  wscript.echo strPath amp   amp strDestPath  For Each objFile In objFolder.Files  Call ListFile objFile, objFolder Next  DoSubfolders objFSO.GetFolderstrPath  DataList.Sort  strFileSize DESC DataList.MoveFirst Do Until DataList.EOF  strFilePath  DataList.Fields.ItemstrFilePath  strFile  DataList.Fields.ItemstrFileName  strFileName  DataList.Fields.ItemstrFileSize  strFileSizeLG  LenstrFileSize  intPadding  15  strFileSizeLG  strDisplayName  strFile amp SpaceintPadding   wscript.echo strFilePath amp  amp strFile amp    amp strDestPath amp ReplacestrFilePath,strPath, amp  amp strFile  wscript.echo strFilePath amp  amp strFile amp , amp strDestPath amp ReplacestrFilePath,strPath, amp    If NotobjFSO.FileExistsstrDestPath amp ReplacestrFilePath,strPath, amp  amp strFile Then   If NotobjFSO.FolderExistsstrDestPath amp ReplacestrFilePath,strPath, amp  Then    objFSO.CreateFolder strDestPath amp ReplacestrFilePath,strPath,   End If   wscript.echo strFilePath amp  amp strFile, strDestPath amp ReplacestrFilePath,strPath, amp    objFSO.CopyFile strFilePath amp  amp strFile, strDestPath amp ReplacestrFilePath,strPath, amp ,True  End If  DataList.MoveNext Loop  Sub DoSubFoldersFolder     For Each Subfolder in Folder.SubFolders         Set objFolder  objFSO.GetFolderSubfolder.Path         Set colFiles  objFolder.Files         For Each objFile in colFiles             Call ListFile objFile, objFolder         Next         DoSubFolders Subfolder     Next End Sub  Sub ListFile objFile, objFolder  DataList.AddNew  DataListstrFilePath  objFSO.GetAbsolutePathNameobjFolder  DataListstrFileName  objFile.Name  DataListstrFileSize  IntobjFile.Size1000  If DataListstrFileSize  0 Then DataListstrFileSize  1  DataList.Update End Sub  Set DataList  Nothing  Set objFSO  Nothing  Set objFolder  Nothing  codepre  pIve now worked using the code suggested below, and have this new script with a few error checks and fixes in.

Negative 3227 pIn a program Im writing for a friends business, I am using the reportlab module to build PDF documents for various reports.  In most cases, the report can be contained on a single page, but it may span across two pages in some rare circumstances.  In those rare situations, what Id like to do is reformat the page with smaller top and bottom margins to see if I can get it to fit on a single page.  If not, Ill just use minimal margins and let it span two pages.p  pTo build a report, Im creating an instance of the codeSimpleDocTemplatecode class.  After passing in all my flowables to the codebuildcode method, I found that I can query the codepagecode attribute to see how many pages it used.  Heres the first thing I triedp  precodeparts  [] path  pathtomyfile.pdf  ... a bunch of code that appends various flowables to parts doc  SimpleDocTemplatepath, pagesizelandscapeletter doc.buildparts  Shrink the margins while its more than one page and the margins are above zero while doc.page gt 1 and not any[doc.topMargin lt 0, doc.bottomMargin lt 0]      Decrease the page margins and rebuild the page     doc.topMargin  inch  .125     doc.bottomMargin  inch  .125     doc.buildparts  If the margins are nil and were still at 2 or more pages, use minimal margins if doc.page gt 1     doc.topMargin  inch  .25     doc.bottomMargin  inch  .25     doc.buildparts codepre  pI assumed that calling the codebuildcode method with the same parts after changing the margins would recalculate everything.  However, after much trial and error, I learned that the codepartscode list thats passed to the codebuildcode method is essentially stripped clean during the build process, leaving codepartscode as an empty list.  Once this was passed back to the codebuildcode method again, it created a document with zero pages.p  pTo work around that, I tried building the document using a copy of the codepartscode listp  precodedoc.buildparts[] codepre  pThat led to some bizarre exception, so I tried a deep copy using the codecopycode modulep  precodedoc.buildcopy.deepcopyparts codepre  pThis didnt throw any exceptions, but didnt change the margins, either.p  pGetting a little desperate, I probed deeper into the codeSimpleDocTemplatecode attributes and found a method named codecalccode.  Thinking that this might recalculate the page, I tried calling it after changing the margins.  It didnt throw any exceptions, but didnt work, either.p  pThe only way Ive managed to make it work is to use the codedeepcopycode process and build brand new documents every time I tweak the marginsp  precodedoc  SimpleDocTemplatepath, pagesizelandscapeletter doc.buildcopy.deepcopyparts  Shrink the margins while its more than one page and the margins are above zero while doc.page gt 1 and not any[doc.topMargin lt 0, doc.bottomMargin lt 0]     doc.topMargin  inch  .125     doc.bottomMargin  inch  .125     doc  SimpleDocTemplatepath, pagesizelandscapeletter,                             topMargin  doc.topMargin,                             bottomMargin  doc.bottomMargin     doc.buildcopy.deepcopyparts  If the margins are nil and were still at 2 or more pages, use minimal margins if doc.page gt 1     doc.topMargin  inch  .25     doc.bottomMargin  inch  .25     doc  SimpleDocTemplatepath, pagesizelandscapeletter,                             topMargin  doc.topMargin,                             bottomMargin  doc.bottomMargin     doc.buildcopy.deepcopyparts codepre  pHowever, it feels like a lot of unnecessary work to go that route.

Negative 3227 pIm currently trying to get used to Python and have recently hit block in my coding. I couldnt run a code that would count the number of times a phrase appears in an html file.

Any advice will be sincerely appreciated.

Negative 3227 h1Backgroundh1  phr Im working on a project for school. The goal is to create a learning website in the end. Ive been creating my website locally and testing it going great so far, so I dediced to place it on the server to test it out there deploy .war file. And as soon as I did that the whole website seems to not work.br brp  h1Problemh1  phr The problem is that as soon as I try to click on any of my links that go through servlets, I get an error from tomcat saying that the requested resource is not available http status 404. Which is sort of weird because it does work locally.br brp  h1What have I triedh1  phr The first thing I noticed was that going to the server .war file is going to a snapshot url first in my case codehttp145.92.6.858080PDL1.0SNAPSHOTcode instead of just landing on the index.jsp page right away which happens locally so my first thought was that it was using a whole different way to access the files I was looking for. Again strange because locally everything is working fine using tomcat as well. I looked inside my project and tried to access the files I was looking for using the map structure, and this seemed to work. So instead of using the servlet I specified on the web.xml its just ignoring it.br br So then I decided it probaply cant find my web.xml file. I did a little searching online and found that it should be placed inside the map WEBINF. Currently web.xml was sitting in METAINF, so placed it in WEBINF, but to no avail. The pages Im looking for still cant be found. I also read that some people said the classes for the projects which I assume to be my servlets need to be placed inside a codeclassescode directory inside the WEBINF folder. I decided not to do this, because currently Ive got them all set up in different packages Source Packages  controllersmodels etc.. And that seemed a lot more logical to me, and besides its working locally so why would this not work on the serverp  pAs far as I can tell my web.xml is set up correctly, but Ill show some code to indicate what the problem is.br brp  h1Codeh1  phr This is the URL Im trying to follow inside a navigation bar follows codehttp145.92.6.858080PDLinlogcodep  precodeltligt     lta hrefPDLinloggtLog Inltagt ltligt codepre  pthis is the web.xmlp  precodeltservletgt     ltservletnamegtloginltservletnamegt     ltservletclassgtcontrollers.loginltservletclassgt ltservletgt  ltservletmappinggt     ltservletnamegtloginltservletnamegt     lturlpatterngtloginlturlpatterngt ltservletmappinggt codepre  pThe inlog.java file inside Source Packagescontrollers or PDLsrcmainjavacontrollersp  precodeOverride protected void doGetHttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response         throws ServletException, IOException      RequestDispatcher rd  request.getRequestDispatcherpagesinlog.jsp     rd.forwardrequest, response  codepre  pThis is where it breaks because it could not be found.p  pbrp  h1Finallyh1  phr Whilst writing this question I do feel as if my URLs and stuff are maybe a little bit too changing and perhaps should be more dynamic than the current static ones since the server enviroment is different I guess.

Negative 3227 pI have a number of lowlevel methods in my play 2.0 application Java that are calling an external Web Service Neo4j via REST, to be specific. Each of them returns a codePromiseltWS.Responsegtcode. To test these methods I am currently installing a codeCallbackltWS.Responsegtcode on their return values via codeonRedeemcode. The codeCallbackcodes contain the assertions to perform on individual codeWS.Responsecodes. Each test relies on some specific fixtures that I am installingremoving via codesetUpClasscode and codetearDownClasscode, respectively.p  pThe problem that I am facing is that due to my test code being fully asynchronous, the teardown logic ends up getting called strongbeforestrong all of the codeCallbackcodes have had a chance to run. As a result, not all fixtures are being removed, and the database is left in a state that is different from the state it was in before running the tests.p  pOne way to fix this problem would be to call codegetcode with some arbitrary timeout on the codePromisecode objects returned by the functions that are being tested, but that solution seems fairly brittle and unreliable to me. What if, for some reason not under my applications control, the Web Service calls do not complete within the timeout In that case, my tests would fail or error out even though my code is actually correct.p  pstrongSo my question isstrong Is there a way of testing code that calls external Web Services that is nonblocking and still ensures database consistency And if there isnt, which of the two approaches outlined above is the canonicalaccepted way of testing this kind of codep

Negative 3227 pOk, lets say there are two associated models, where the main model has a hasMany relationship with the other model. ex Donor hasMany Donations. I have read most of cakes documentation and I also took note of this from the docp  blockquote   pWhen working with associated models, it is important to realize that   saving model data should always be done by the corresponding CakePHP   model. If you are saving a new Post and its associated Comments, then   you would use both Post and Comment models during the save operationa hrefhttpbook.cakephp.org2.0enmodelssavingyourdata.html relnofollowhttpbook.cakephp.org2.0enmodelssavingyourdata.htmlap blockquote  pAnd as also pointed out by burzum on another one of my questions  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21468040cakephpcontrollerornocontroller21469207noredirect1comment3241369621469207CakePHP  Controller or No Controllera , I am still struggling on how to decide which works best. p  pSo taking the Donor and Donation example mentioned earlier, lets say we want the user to add  donation to a donor.  So for the user to add a donation, one would need to view a donor, accessing a url of the sort  domaindonorsview1, meaning the user is currently viewing donor with id of 1. Then within that view, let us assume there is button which allows the user to add a donation. Now from what I have been told and from what I read, the adddonation action should belong to the donationsController. p  pLet us also assume that the adddonation action has its own view.. So if I am at domaindonorsview1 the user is redirected to domaindonationsadddonorid1 where the id of the donor is then retrieved using  codethisgtrequestgtparams[named][postid]code  and  set to the FK like so   thisrequestdata[Donation][donorid]  idp  pBut I have a gut feeling telling me that this is not the proper way to go and it feels like bad practice jumping from one controller to the other, when having associated models. p  pAny insight on this  Is there a general rule of thumb one could apply or follow  Is it ok to redirect the user from the donorsControllers view action to the donationsControllers add action  p  pThanks in advance p

Negative 3227 pIm working on a page that has three sections for now. Instead of behaving like a scrollable page, I want the page to detect the users intent to scroll by grabbing scrollwheel data  and automatically scroll to that section. In this way, each tier of the page is meant to be scrolled into position covering entire window without other tiers being visible. p  pThe problem Im having is that the code detects the scrollwheel events and fires the scroll function too quickly, building a queue that scrolls the page entirely in the direction defined by scroll. Basically, I cant get it to stick in the middle tier.p  pIve tried throttling the scroll event via this a hrefhttpremysharp.com20100721throttlingfunctioncalls relnofollowhttpremysharp.com20100721throttlingfunctioncallsap  pIve also tried implementing .stop and .clearQueue methods.

Negative 3227 pI have a website that lets you create brackets by guessing scores and the winning teams for the world cup. Right now you just have to fill in the bracket by hand. I would like it to where it would be reading what they are inserting while they are inserting the scores and make some calculations to be able to put the winners for the groups instead of them having to calculate the points by hand. The scores and winners are inserted in input fields or select fields. Is there anyway to do that using php, html, or anything. I just cannot find anything and am looking for someone to just lead me in the right direction. Examples of my code will be put below just to help. Thanksp  pClarification Okay so lets say the teams selects Brazil for the firstGroupA. How can i put that in a variable to use later before they actually submit.

Negative 3227 pI have created a codehtmlcode page using coded3.jscode to create and control a rather complex codesvgcode.

Negative 3227 pIm experimenting with the cache.p  pI noticed if you store an array of strings the strings will be separated by a codekommacode .br I couldnt find a method that allows to retrieve the array as an array, only as a string seems possible.br Obviously retrieval of the array by splitting the string obtained will cause a problem if the array elements contain kommas.

Negative 3227 pI have a simple app that stores user transactions for an account. My question is where should the user input data be stored to update the UI. Do I first load the input in a flat table and then insert into the normalized table. This way, for UI update I would have to read the flat table. I am also trying to have a reporting functionality, hence, I am planning on user a star schema table for reporting. p  pAs of now, my plan is user data goes into flat table, which is read to update the UI of transactions. Then I will transfer the data to a normalized table. Later run a ETL process for the star schema load for reporting. p  pI am new in data modeling, so please feel free to correct my errors and suggestions for improvement. My data amount is very little, so in reality speed is not an issue. But I want to model it as if such that it can handle on a large scale data. The table is working, but I want to know the better way to do so.  p

Both .ActionSheet and .Alert styles work on 8.0.  p  piPad 7.1  UIActionSheet now works, but you need to add a dummy extra button  it fails to display the last button added.br iPad 8.0  UIAlertController .Alert works, but looks bad, and .ActionSheet still crashes as does UIActionSheet.p  pUPDATED for Beta7br No changes.  iPhones work as expected.  iPads still broken as above.  p  pUPDATED for GM Some improvement for iPad 8.0.  Or else I didnt figure it out before. iPhones still work correctly.  Including the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in the simulator.p  piPad 7.1  UIActionSheet still needs dummy button.  The cancelButtonIndex will darken the text to indicate that its the cancel button, but it does not offset it.p  piPad 8.0  UIActionSheet doesnt crash, but dont use it. If the cancelButtonIndex is not 1 then there are problems with which buttons at the end of the list are displayed.  It might still need a dummy button.  But now the cancelButtonIndex must be set to the dummy button which will not display.  But even worse, the clickedButtonAtIndex is called twice, once with the clicked button and once with the cancelButtonIndex.  Its as though its detecting a bogus  when the action sheet closes.p  piPad 8.0  UIAlertController with .Alert is still OK.br iPad 8.0  UIAlertController with .ActionSheet can now work if the popoverPresentationController sourceRect and sourceView are set.  This was possibly the case earlier, too, but Im not going to retest the older betas..  But, theres one more gotcha  UIAlertActionStyle.Cancel causes the button to disappear, so dont use it.  p  pUPDATED for 6.0.1br iPad 7.1  UIActionSheet still needs dummy button.br iPad 8.0  UIAlertController with .Alert is OK.  The button with UIAlertActionStyle.Cancel is automatically placed at the bottom of the list of buttons.br iPad 8.0  UIAlertController with .ActionSheet still needs the popoverPresentationController values set.  And UIAlertActionStyle.Cancel still fails.  p  pSummary  no improvements yetbr iPhone  all versions work fine  can use UIActionSheet and UIAlertController as .Alert and .ActionSheet.br iPad 7.1  UIActionSheet works with dummy.br iPad 8.0  UIAlertController works as .Alert and .ActionSheet.

Negative 3227 pI have been doing some investigations into some light weight database Syncing tools to trial.  The initial task we want to perform is a simple data sync from a few tables on a Sybase ASE database 15 to a SQL Server database 2008 R2.  Timing wise, Id like to keep my options open, but ultimately, I would like to have the ability to sync every minute or less.p  pI have been looking at SymmetricDS, which at face value seems to do exactly what I want it to.  The drama is I have hit a couple of roadblocks on the Sybase side of things, which is proving to be very frustrating Jumpmind support are assisting.  It appears that Java has a problem with the default collation we have on our server, being HProman8.  Unfortunately, to change this charset is way bigger then this project itself.p  pI have also started investigating Talend, but have hit a few roadblocks in relation to requiring older versions of drivers for Sybase and downgrading the installed version of Java.p  pWithout having to go to Replication Server, does anyone have any suggestions on a relatively lightweight ETL or database Syncing tool that will do what I want  The biggest gotcha thus far is Sybase support  I really need something that will seamlessly work without having to hack too much.p  pCheersp

If you have configured your browser to disable Referer headers, please reenable them, at least for this site, or for HTTPS connections, or for sameorigin requests.

In general, this can occur when there is a genuine Cross Site Request Forgery, or when Djangos CSRF mechanism has not been used correctly. For POST forms, you need to ensure Your browser is accepting cookies. The view function uses RequestContext for the template, instead of Context. In the template, there is a  csrftoken  template tag inside each POST form that targets an internal URL. If you are not using CsrfViewMiddleware, then you must use csrfprotect on any views that use the csrftoken template tag, as well as those that accept the POST data.

Negative 3227 pWhat should be the best design in JAva to implement below logic. User submits the request and goes to back end to get the response,back end provides token and use this token to make multiple calls in pre configred intervals to back end to get the actual response.Till the actual back end response available,user will see loading indictor in the FE. From  user prespective,its sync call but back end perpsective,we have to make async calls to get the actual response. So i am thinking about implementing Ajax calls in regular intervals to get the actual response.but is there any way to get this implemented in Javamiddletier instead of invoking calls from UIAjax calls with the token recieved from backend.So  any better solution around JMS or any other framework which will support this kind of facility Maximum time lime limit for actual back end response is 2 mins..p

Negative 3227 pIm currently running a python web API that is NOT multithreaded with much success on the uWSGI  NGINX stack. Due to new operational needs, I have implemented a new build that includes multithreaded requests to external data sources. However, when I deploy this new multithreaded build under uWSGI with codeenablethreadscode, after a few minutes, the machine runs out of available threads.p  pI was able to isolate the issue to my usage of geventhttpclient for my external HTTP requests by monitoring the thread count using codeps eLf  grep ltprocess idgt wc lcode. I have currently 2 worker threads two external requests in my application, so as I noticed, every time I hitmake a request from my API, the application thread use count increases by 2. If I swap my use of geventhttpclient with the standard python Requests module in just one of these worker threads, the thread count only increases by 1. p  pNOTE I am using HTTPClient.close to close the connection within each thread.p  pThis leads me to suspect that geventhttpclient creates new threads that do not terminate when used in multithreaded uWSGI applications.p  pIs there an easy way around this chokepoint The performance of geventhttpclient is exceptional in nonmultithreaded uWSGI applications, so I would love to continue using this.p  pThanks and let me know if I can provide any more information.p

Negative 3227 pI want to preface this by saying that I am a beginner to asp.net, especially when it comes to working with the codeFormViewcode controls. I have searched long and hard and have spent hours debugging this issue. p  pI have 3 codeFormViewscode on one aspx page. Each codeFormViewcode has its own codeEditItemTemplatecode and codePagerTemplatecode with codeDefaultModeEditcode. I am not using a codeSqlDataSourcecode, but instead databinding programatically on the codePageLoadcode when codeifPage.IsPostBackcode and also calling the databinding method when the codePageIndexChangingcode method is called. The pager template contains a Back and a Next button set with codeCommandArgumentPrevcode and codeCommandArgumentNextcode, respectively, and both set with codeCommandNamePagecode. p  pThe paging works great on the first codeFormViewcode. When I hit the back or next button, it pages i.e. rebinds appropriately. During the 1st codeFormViewcodes paging event, I also successfully call the binding methods for the 2nd and 3rd codeFormViewcode since I want them to bind data that is specific to the page selected in the 1st codeFormViewcode. p  pBut, when I page back to the first page of the 1st codeFormViewcode i.e. codePageIndex  0code, and then try to page forward in the 2nd codeFormViewcode, the datakey for the 1st codeFormViewcode is null. In fact, the codeformview1.DataSourcecode is null for the 1st codeFormViewcode when I try to click a navigation button on the 2nd codeFormViewcode. p  pThen, heres where I thought it was weird, ... if I click back a second time on the 1st codeFormViewcode, THEN the codeformview1.DataSourcecode is fine, and I can then navigate in the 2nd codeFormViewcode. p  pAll viewstates for the formviews and the buttons are set to true.  I have tried calling codeformview1.DataBindcode inside codeformview2codes paging event before any paging occurs but no success there. I have also tried setting properties codeUseSubmitBehaviorFalsecode and codeCausesValidationFalsecode on the paging buttons. Admittedly, I did this without really understanding the behavior but rather implemented after seeing it suggested in solutions for other somewhat related problems. p  pThe templates are rather long since there are many fields in each. But the codeFormViewcode tags look like this            p  precodeltaspFormView IDfvHeader runatserver DataKeyNamesObjectID DefaultModeEdit AllowPagingTrue OnModeChangingfvHeaderModeChanging OnPageIndexChanging fvHeaderPageIndexChanginggt  ltEditItemTemplategt ..... ltEditItemTemplategt ltaspFormViewgt codepre  pPagerTemplatesp  precode       ltPagerSettings ModeNextPrevious gt        ltPagerTemplategt            ltspan classlabelsgtPage ltfvHeader.PageIndex1gt of ltfvHeader.PageCount gtltspangtampnbsp            ltaspButton IDbtnBack runatserver CommandArgumentPrev CommandNamePage CssClassbtnHdr Textampltamplt Back gtampnbsp            ltaspButton IDbtnNext runatserver CommandArgumentNext CommandNamePage CssClassbtnHdr TextNext ampgtampgt gtampnbspltPagerTemplategt codepre  pNote that codefvHeadercode is what Im calling codeformview1code for simplicity in my question. p  pBackNext buttons C code and databinding the 1st formviewp  precode    protected void fvHeaderPageIndexChangingobject sender, FormViewPageEventArgs e                                  fvHeader.PageIndex  e.NewPageIndex                     bindFVInitial                       rebind fvSub1 2nd formview to get the 1st obs of the newly selected header record                     fvSub1.ChangeModeFormViewMode.Edit                     fvSub1.PageIndex  0                     bindSub1Initial  rebind 2nd subform                     fvSub2.ChangeModeFormViewMode.Edit                     fvSub2.PageIndex  0                     bindSub2Initial                     private void bindFVInitial                                  if conn.State  ConnectionState.Open                                              conn.Close                                           conn.Open                      if dtEOS  null  dtEOS.Rows.Count  0                                              sqlda  new SqlDataAdapterUSE dbWEF SELECT  FROM tblHeader WHERE [UserID]    Session[User]   AND [ProjectName]    Session[Project]  , conn                          sqlda.FilldtEOS                                           fvHeader.DataSource  dtEOS                     fvHeader.DataBind                      conn.Close                      if dtEOS.Rows.Count gt 0                                              fillDDfvHeader Fill dropdowns and databind ddls                                                     codepre  pBelow is the error message I receive when I attempt to navigate the 2nd formview. p  precode    Error in bindSub1Initial.

Negative 3227 pMy app generates reports for business and one option allows the user to view all the invoices in the app. p  pThe app was working fine until now. As the data in the app grows, the reports become larger in size. Currently, the report has stopped displaying.

Negative 3227 pAbout 2 weeks ago I wrote a program implementing the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.yodlee.comAggregationAPIAggregationServicesGuideAPIFlowAddSiteAccount relnofollowAdd Site Account flow charta.p  pI ran it a number of times over a span of several days, and it worked fine each time.p  pThen I worked on other things, and about a week later tried running the above program again.  Now it did not work, but got into a seemingly infinite loop on the call to getSiteRefreshInfo the loop in the lower left corner of the flow chart.  I tried running this a number of times over the next 34 days, and got into a loop each time. It looped for 2030 minutes before I killed the program.  This is exactly the same source code that worked correctly a week earlier, using exactly the same credentials.p  pEach time code was 0, and siteRefreshStatus was LOGINSUCCESS, which according to the flowchart meant I should wait 24 seconds and then repeat the callp  precode   siteRefreshStatus      siteRefreshStatusId 2,     siteRefreshStatus LOGINSUCCESS   ,   siteRefreshMode      refreshModeId 2,     refreshMode NORMAL   ,   updateInitTime 1418945894,   nextUpdate 1418946794,   code 0,   itemRefreshInfo [            memItemId 10070147,       itemSuggestedFlow          suggestedFlowId 2,         suggestedFlow REFRESH       ,       errorCode 405,       retryCount 0        ],   noOfRetry 0  codepre  pThe account Im passing to addSiteAccount1 is an American Express credit card account, and this is the only account Ive added for this user in other words, this is the only account that needs to be refreshed.  Once while the program was in a loop, I manually logged onto the American Express website using these same credentials, and I could view the account, get the list of recent transactions, etc.  I realize that Yodlee probably uses a different interface than the browser does, but this did show me that the Amex website was up and functional.p  pI tried letting the loop run for more than 30 minutes to see what happened.  After an hour and 55 minutes I got this exceptionp  precode   errorOccurred true,   exceptionType Unknown Exception Occurred,   referenceCode 022c5fa339334491b3901150d8b28ab3,   detailedMessage Technical Difficulty Processing Request  codepre  pI tried running the program various times over the next 34 days and it got into a loop each time.  Then it abruptly started running correctly again, and at the moment is still running correctly.  Note that the exact same source code and credentials ran correctly for a while, then got into a loop for 34 days, and is now running correctly again.p  pI have two questions about thisp  p1 How should I exit from such a loop  The way I interpret the API Flowchart is that I should loop until I get a value for code or siteRefreshStatus that tells me to exit the loop.  I could easily implement my own timer, but I dont know what time value would be appropriate in all cases.  Yodlee is in a better position to know if the loop has gone on for too long, so I would expect a return like REFRESHTIMEDOUT in this case.p  p2 If we had been running this code in production, we would not have been able to refresh this customers information for at least 3 days, which for our application would be an extremely long time.  Is there anything else we can try in this casep  pThanksp

Negative 3227 pId like to toggle a class when an element is clicked using AngularJS. I need the clicked element to received the class, and any other items in the list to loose the class. Ive researched a number of supposed solutions for this on SO, however in implementing them, they dont work appropriately and I dont understand why they would even. p  pThe general solution proposed is to set a variable to the index of the item in the codengrepeatcode list. Then use codengclasscode to add the class. JSFiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net92agya3j relnofollowherea.p  precodeltdiv ngappgt ltp ngrepeatitem in [a, b, c]     ngclickselectedIndex  index     ngclassselected index  selectedIndex     gtitemltpgt ltdivgt codepre  pThe problem is that the selected class is never removed from the previous elements. So, clicking an element adds the class to the element as expected, but clicking another element doesnt remove the class from previously clicked elements. I would guess because Angular is emnotem rerendering the entire list on each click and thus the old clicked elements dont change. That begs my question though, why is this such an overwhelmingly proposed solution Am I just implementing something wrong Thanks.p

Negative 3227 pIm trying to adhere to good OO design principles and design patterns and such. So while developing this C application of mine I can often find multiple solutions to design and architecture issues, I always want to find and implement the more canonical one in the hopes of building highly maintainable and flexible software and also become a better OO programmer.p  pSo suppose I have these two abstract classes codeCharactercode and codeWeaponcode. p  precodeabstract class Weapon      public string Name  get set    abstract class Character      public Weapon weapon  get set   codepre  pDerived classes might be codeSwordcode and codeStaffcode from codeWeaponcode, and codeWarriorcode and codeMagecode from codeCharactercode, etc. this is all hypothetical, not related to my actual software.p  pEvery codeCharactercode has a codeWeaponcode, but for every implementation of codeCharactercode I know what implementation of codeWeaponcode it will have. For instance, I know and I want to enforce that at runtime every instance of codeWarriorcode will have a codeWeaponcode of type codeSwordcode. Of course I could do thisp  precodeclass Sword  Weapon      public void Draw     class Warrior  Character      public Warrior              weapon  new Sword       codepre  pBut this way, every time I want to use my codeWeaponcode object properly inside a codeWarriorcode, I have to perform a cast, which I believe to be a not so great of a practice. Also I have no means to prevent myself from messing up, that is, there is no type safety p  pAn ideal solution would be to be able to override the codeWeapon weaponcode property in the codeWarriorcode class with a codeSword  weaponcode property, that way I have type safety and if the user uses my codeWarriorcode as a codeCharactercode, he can still use my codeSwordcode as a codeWeaponcode. Sadly, it doesnt seem like C supports this kind of construct.p  pSo here are my questions is this some kind of classical OO problem, with a name and a welldocumented solution In that case I would very much like to know the name of the problem and the solutions. Some links to good reading material would be very helpful  If not, what kind of class design would you propose in order to maintain functionality and enforce type safety in an elegant and idiomatic wayp  pThanks for readingp

Is there a way I can make this happenp  pOther notep  pThe reason I have codeoldcachecode is because I believe I was having a problem when reading from the cache, which is most likely also a problem.  My program seemed to be crashing when trying to read elements from the map returned from codegetcachecode, so to make sure they stayed in scope until all threads that currently had a copy were done, I save the last version of the cache.  I suppose if I had the correct way to do this, I could get rid of the codeoldcachecode all together, which should solve the problem above.p  pEditp  pHere is the code using the cachep  precodeVector big, dont want to copy const stdvector selectedvec  ampdbcachegetcache.atgetstring for stdvectorltstdstringgtiterator it  selectedvecgtbegin, e  selectedvecgtend it  e it     String can be big, dont want to copy    const stdstring curstring  ampit    ifcurstring  nullptr  curstringgtsize  0            continue        char a  curstringgtat0  Crash here     Do Stuff  codepre  pMy actual codemaptcode type is a codestdmapltstdstring,stdvectorltstdstringgtgtcode type not a codestdmapltint,intgtcode.

I am doing this on a real device, I have tried various devices.p  pHow ever if I debug the code using ruby mine using breakpoint it produces the desired result.p  pI have the below setupp  pre       xcodeselect printpath     ApplicationsXcode.appContentsDeveloper       xcodebuild version     Xcode 6.1.1     Build version 6A2008a       calabashios version     0.11.4      curl http37265version     appversion4.3,     outcomeSUCCESS,     appid,     simulatordevice,     version0.11.4,     appname,     iphoneappemulatedonipadfalse,     4inchtrue,     gitremoteorigingitgithub.comcalabashcalabashiosserver.git,     branchmaster,revisionbcc992b,     screendimensionsscale2,width640,sample1,height1136,     iOSversion7.1.2,     systemiPhone5,2,simulator   pre  pI have checked that My App is linked with the correct calabash.framework and that it matches the gem version 0.11.4p  pWhen I debug using ruby mine then the steps run successfully the touch works and the keyboard is activated, how ever when I run from command line or run without breakpoints in Ruby mine, the touch just seems to fail without issuing any warnings or errors.

Negative 3227 pAccording to a hrefhttpdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.6enintegertypes.html relnofollowthisa page MySQL uses 4 bytes for the field type INT and 8 bytes for the type BIGINT. But when creating columns without specifying the field lengthsize, MySQL sets the sizes to int11 and bigint20 which seems to match the maximum numbers of this field types AS STRING INT with negative sign is 11 byteschars long and BIGINT with negative sign is 20 byteschars long.p  pSo what exactly does the sizelength of the field specify Does it specify the chars of the value which might not be necessary the same like the amount of bytes  e. g. for Unicode or does it specify the real amount of bytes used depending on the field type Is MySQL  Engine really storing integer values and all other values always as string representation on the diskp

Negative 3227 pIve developed an Angular based web shop that works against Woocommerce as a backend. When I add an item to the cart, the server responds with a SetCookie header where the WooCommerce session id resides. This cookie should be passed to the server upon the next request, so that the server knows that its the same session. However, if I dont have the codeallowCredentialscode flag set in my request from the Angular http call, the cookies isnt passed to the server.p  pWhat we did first was to set the codeallowCredentialscodeto codetruecode, and it worked great Now we are developing an Ionic app for the same shop. We cant have the allowCredentials flag set, because it isnt allowed together with codeAccessControlAllowOrigin code, which we need to have set because the API is being called from different origins because of the app.p  pHow can we make Angular pass the cookies without having the allowCredentials flag setp

Negative 3227 pI am from codeOOPcode background and and want to clear my idea about codeObjectcode, codeClassescode, codeTraitcode, codeSealed Traitcode and codeCase Classescode in codeScalacode, I am writing below what I understand about it so farp  pWe create codeObjectcode, when we want to code some utility functions inside it and we can access it directly, without using new keyword like Static classes in Java.p  pWe create codeClassescode, when we are coding for verb means an object and its behavior encapsulated same as we code for classes in Java and we instantiate it using new keyword.p  pWe create codeTraitcode when we want to code same as Abstract classes in codeJavacode.p  pWe create codeSealed Traitcode when we want to achieve functionality as same Enum in Java.p  pWe create codeCase classescode when we can expect that this class can be used for pattern matching in future similar to instanceOf in Java.p  pIs my understanding correct about all thesep

Negative 3227 pIm trying to implement autocomplete plugin from jqueryUI on my clients website, but I find it very difficult to make it look and behave the way I want. Im not experienced in using jqueryUI at all and its code and css is way too complicated for me. Apart from changing colors etc. anything bigger is beyond my grasp but default settings do not work well with the website.p  pTo give you example what I need to achieve  I need to set various sizes depending on screen size, I need the whole list to be in position relative to the element that is fixed only at times right now when the list is displayed and someone scrolls the document, it goes up and down with the whole document, even though the input form is actually in fixed position. And theres more.p  pSo to question  I was wondering  is there any way to get from the plugin just the information it generates in the form of plain list of suggested items Then I could make my own code that will display and behave the way I want. And if its not that simple  maybe someone knows some other plugin who works like autocomplete but gives back just the raw information that we can do anything with. Thank you for suggestions and ideas. Cheersp
Negative 3227 pMy CoWorkers and I were wondering about the cryptography export restriction of the US and their current state.p  pWe want to create a encrypted chat where you can send photos and stuff and its all encrypted with RSA in combination with extreme long prime numbers. It all should be compiled into an app for AndroidWindows etc. but we saw that we have to accept the export agreements of the USA because the app is hosted on US Servers.p  pAs we are exceeding a really high BIT count of encryption and are not able to decrypt anything of the Users content we fear that we can not export the app.p  pAs a non native english speaker the BIS Website is not really clear. Can someone explain if we are allowed to export it or not with a short explanation and a link to official documents to prove their state  We would be really thankful.p  pRegardsp  pPS Sorry for bad english.p

Negative 3227 pI am using an ultrasonic sensor to read water level by using python.There are 5 chances of getting wrong value from the sensor. 5 is not a variation of value from actual value. it is actually the percentage of getting wrong value. Which causes all correct and wrong values at the same place. How can i remove that 5 error values from the data the data sample looks like this. p  p45.1,45.3,45.4,45.7,46.6,47.1,47.9,48.1,48.4,48.8,49.1,49.2,49.1,46.2,45.2,45.7,45.8,43.6,45.6,44.6p  pThese are 20 values. one 5 out of these 20 values is wrong which i want to exclude.p  pThank youp

Negative 3227 pIm having a configuration problem with my codeImageViewcode. I found code online that helps me to integrate taking a photo from my app. What it does is leaves the app, goes to the Android Camera, then returns with the photo. From here, I place it into an codeImageViewcode. Everything worked fine until I had to add a configuration change. The image disappears when I change the configuration.p  pTo overcome this problem, I managed a way to get my codeVideoViewcode it alternates the view with my codeImageViewcode to save state, but it has different code requirements to save than the image does. Here is what I have so far. I have tried to research solutions, but nothing makes sense to me. Does my code look incompletep  pThanks.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pUpon further study, the state strongisstrong saved if I do not rotate the camera while taking a photo. If the starting orientation is the same as the orientation when I come back to the app after taking photo, then the configuration change strongwithinstrong the app works fine. The problem is that if I, say, start in portrait mode, then click the photo button. This takes me to the Android camera. Then I decide I want a landscape photo after all, so I rotate it then snap the photo. I press okay, which then takes me back to the app. Once I arrive, since Im now in landscape mode, my codeImageViewcode is blank. p  pstrongAlsostrong I did a log on the codemImageBitmapcode inside of codeonSaveInstanceStatecode amp codeonRestoreInstanceStatcodee and they both are null. But why Maybe because the bitmap is not created until it comes back from the camera Then how am I supposed to save it on a configuration change So confused.p  pstrongMy two saving state methodsstrongp

Negative 3227 pI have created an utterly simple blackjack game that stores the first value of a shuffled array of cards into corresponding players arrays, dealing them as actual hands. For some odd reason, I cant seem to find a way to execute the core part of the code multiple times without getting an infinite loop. For the time being, I have only tried running the quite commonplace for command which is meant for multiple statements, but just doesnt seem to work here. p  pThe programm on its primitive form is as follows...p  precodevar dealerCards  [] var playerCards  [] var firstDeck  []  function shuffleo   forvar j, x, i  o.length i j  Math.floorMath.random  i, x  o[i], o[i]  o[j], o[j]  x   return o   function createShuffledDeckNumberarray, x     for i  0 i lt 4x i    array.push1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13        shufflearray   function drawCardplayersHand, playerSoft, playerHard    playersHand.pushfirstDeck[0]   firstDeck.shift   function checkDeckDrawOneplayersHand    if firstDeck.length  0      createShuffledDeckNumberfirstDeck, 1     drawCardplayersHand   else     for i  0 i lt 1 i        drawCardplayersHand           for i  0 i lt 4 i  dealerCards  [] playerCards  [] checkDeckDrawOnedealerCards checkDeckDrawOnedealerCards  checkDeckDrawOneplayerCards checkDeckDrawOneplayerCards console.logdealerCards,dealerCards,playerCards,playerCards console.logfirstDeckDrawn, firstDeck, Number, firstDeck.length  codepre  pAdditional Notesp  pThe presumed objective could be performing calculations to figure out the winner by imitating the effect of consecutive computing rounds based on a finite number of values stored in each players array. Although, Ive tried a seried of different things when it comes to emulating the real life circumstances of actually playing blackjack, this version seems to do just that, by also giving the programmer the ability to introduce counting systems like KO or HiLo. The main logic behind the whole thing is fairly simple order x shuffled decks whenever a command that involves drawing a card is being executed unless the deck has at least one card.p  pIts rather fair to ponder why should I possibly bother creating multiple rounds in such a game. Reason is, that I want to create an autoplayer application that provides me with percentages on processed data.p

Negative 3227 pIm working on a project and Ive come out with this doubt. Ive got an ISA relationship which looks like thisp  pcodeUserscode as a parent table, then codeCompanies, Admins and Customerscode as child tables. Since all of them have different attributes Ive decided to create 4 tables and link them to the codeUserscode table which will hold the login information, which is the common information between the childs. p  pMy struggle is that I cant create a child if the parent doesnt exist obviusly, but Id like to let the customers and companies register themselves, so the solution Ive come out with is inserting a new codeusercode, then get the max id from codeuserscode and insert a codecustomercode. But Im not sure if is a good approach, what happens if multiple people try to register at once p  pCould I control the parent insertion from the database instead of my code Maybe with a trigger p  pThat would make more sense to me, mainly because an user itself doesnt make any sense in my context, its either a customer, an admin or a company.p

The user enters 1.1.2015 into the date field, which is interpreted in the server as 200 1.1.2015 UTC 1st of January at 200 AM in UTC, which is midnight in the users time zone. The user then enters 2300 into the time field 24hour clock. This needs to be interpreted in the server as 100 2.1.2015 UTC 2nd of January at 100 AM.p  pWe use Apache Commons codeFastDateFormatcode for transforming strings to codeDatescode and vice versa, and Joda Time for date manipulation. The result needs to be a plain old Java Date. Ive tried to combine the existing codeDatecode instance and the time of day input from the user like thisp  precodeDate datePart ...  The date parsed from the first user input FastDateFormat timeFormat  ... DateTimeZone userTimeZone  DateTimeZone.forTimeZonetimeFormat.getTimeZone String userTimeInput  ...  The time of day from the user  MutableDateTime dateTime  new MutableDateTimedatePart, DateTimeZone.UTC Date newTime  timeFormat.parseuserTimeInput dateTime.setTimenew DateTimenewTime, DateTimeZone.UTC   Determine if the date part needs to be changed due to time zone adjustment long timeZoneOffset  userTimeZone.getOffsetdateTime long newMillisOfDay  dateTime.getMillisOfDay if newMillisOfDay  timeZoneOffset gt 24  60  60  1000      dateTime.addDays1  else if newMillisOfDay  timeZoneOffset lt 0      dateTime.addDays1   Date newServerDate  dateTime.toDate codepre  pChanging the time of day of an existing codeDatecode like this is a bit problematic. The above doesnt work if the user changes the time of day multiple times, the 1 day adjustment is potentially made every time. Also, the above code doesnt take DST into account. If codedatePartcode is in DST, the times entered by our example user should be treated as being in UTC1. When using codeFastDateFormatcode and only parsing the time of day, the date is set to the epoch, meaning that the time entered by the user will always be treated as being in UTC2. This will cause a one hour offset in the result.p  pHow to adjust the codeDatecode in the server based on the given time of day and properly take the time zone and DST into accountp

Negative 3227 pI am new in python. I have three lists of floats of same length. The numbers are randomly distributed in all lists. But the positions of elements in one list corresponds to the other elements of the same positions in other lists. Lets say the lists are,p  pcodea[1,5,3,2,4] b[20,30,50,40,10] c[400,500,100,300,200]codep  pNow, elements of same positions in these three lists correspond each other. Like 1, 20 and 400 correspond each other 3, 50 and 100 correspond each other and so on. I have to arrange the numbers in such a way that for any position i of these three lists if the sum of the corresponding numbers are greater then those three numbers should appear first in the lists. Like, code e[500, 400, 300, 200, 100] f[30,20,40,10,50] g[5,1,2,4,3]codep  pSo the positions of corresponding numbers have changed altogether. Or their correspondence MUST NOT BREAK.

Negative 3227 pIm using JUnit 4 for testing a databaseapplication. Since each test requires a special preset of the database before it runs, Im using the codeBeforecode method to load the data first and the codeAftercode method to delete all data from the database. For some reasons I cannot use DBUnit, but I have to use some custom Java implementation that will do the work of the database loading and cleanup. While I can create an instance of a class from this custom implementation in the codeBeforecode method, it is important that I get the same instance in the codeAftercode method.p  pMy first idea was to use a field e.g., codemyObjectcode in the test class and set it in the codeBeforecode method, so I can use it in the codeAftercode method again. However, Im not sure about the JUnit lifecycle and how it will behave when tests run in parallel, i.e. if codemyObjectcode will be overwritten.p  pAnother idea is to use a JUnit codeTestWatchercode that creates an instance of this object in the codestartingcode method and saves it in a field, too. Then I use codeRulecode in my test class to access this instance via a getter method in the codeTestWatchercode implementation.p  pSo my questions are basicallyp  p1 Is it good practice to preset the database in the codeBeforecode method and delete all data in the codeAftercode method So if the next test requires only a small amount of data to be loaded, it will run much faster.p  p2 How can I access the same instance of an object in the codeAftercode method that was created in the codeBeforecode method. It must be guaranteed that it is the same instance, even if tests run in parallel. Is any of my two ideas a good way to implement it, which is betterp  pThanksp

Negative 3227 pIm trying to use the OSX AVAsset classes to read in video frames from a movie file, adjust the coloring, then write them out to a new movie file. Ive got it all working except, for some weird reason, while Im reading in a video that plays at 29.97 frames per second according to the inspector in Final Cut Pro X, the output video is listed as being 30 frames per second even. This small discrepancy, among other problems, makes it impossible for me to swap the two video files in a Final Cut project.p  pIm using the exact timing information from the decodedinput frames when doing my writingencoding. Heres the relevant code below.p  pWhen readingdecoding a framep  precodeCMSampleBufferRef videoSampleBuffer  [assetReaderVideoOutput copyNextSampleBuffer]   if videoSampleBuffer  NULL     return false    CMSampleTimingInfo myTiming   CMSampleBufferGetSampleTimingInfovideoSampleBuffer, 0, ampmyTiming   frameInfogtframeTimeValue  myTiming.presentationTimeStamp.value   frameInfogtframeTimeScale  myTiming.presentationTimeStamp.timescale codepre  pWhen writingencoding the modified framep  precodeCMTime myTime  CMTimeMakeframeInfogtframeTimeValue, frameInfogtframeTimeScale   [pixelBufferAdapter appendPixelBufferpixelsBuffer withPresentationTimemyTime]  codepre  pIdeas The time scale values do seem to indicate the video should be encoding at 29.97 fps it has frameTimeValue values of 1001 and 2002, etc, with frameTimeScale of 30000. Even if I manually increase the frameTimeValue by like 1030 for each frame rather than 1001, it still pegs the video to 30 fps. Once I crank it to like 1050 I start getting an accurate framerate of like 28.75 or whatever it works out to.p

Negative 3227 pI am automating an email to be sent nightly. The Send email class contains the variables  codemailFromcode and codemailTocode. codeExcelReadercode is a prerequisite class that reads the cells of an Excel worksheet that will contain the email addresses . I need my Send email codeSendCfcode class to get its codemailFromcode and codemailTocode variables from the codeExcelReadercode class which gets its variables from the Excel sheets cells.p  pThe purpose is so other people can modify an Excel sheet with different ToFrom email addresses, and my email sent nightly will reflect that.

Negative 3227 pI have an Asp.Net vNext site that I want to connect to a Silo. The vNext site is already done and in production, but the silo part isnt started yet.

Negative 3227 pOK here is my situation. I have an address book type page lets call it addressbook.asp for an example, on this page new rows of addresses are added every so often, this page also has a search function that can search through an address table and narrow the view. My application also has another topframe.asp page that is the same for every page. p  pWhat Im trying to do is implement a notification system. I want to input the address info I want and when an address record is inputted into my address table on addressbook.asp that matches Ill get a pop up notification. The tricky part is I want this notification check running regardless of what page Im on so I will be putting that function into topframe.asp. When a match is made, topframe.asp will create a pop up window saying there is a match and it will have a link back to addressbook.asp. p  pWhat I need to happen is when this link is clicked, the user is redirected to addressbook.asp and the table showing the addresses are narrowed down by the users search criteria. So I basically need to pass in the users criteria on the redirect through the link into the search form and somehow initiate submit so I can reuse addressbook.asps original search functionality. p  pI was thinking I could use window.opener approach however the page opening the pop up isnt addressbook.asp. Is there a way to use window.opener or is there another function thats similar that will allow me to pass info to a page that is not the pop up windows parentp  pI think the simplified version of this is I need to be able to click my link, the link redirects to addressbook.asp, my table record is passed to the search form and basically search needs to be clicked. p

Negative 3227 pIm developing a single page booking application using angular which interacts with my REST API.p  pI have various routes defined in my application and Im using local storage to store the state of each page as a user fills in their information.

The reason for local storage is so we can persist a users filled in details, even if they close the page and reopen it.p  pI shouldnt store sensitive information such as user names and addresses in local storage though, because this leaves me vulnerable to cross site scripting.p  pStoring this information on the server would break the stateless principles of REST APIs.p  pAre there any suggestions on how to best architect my applicationp

Negative 3227 pOn a MultiAutoCompleteTextView in android I am able to add entries and parse them just fine. After auto completing the most recent item, when I press backspace it will delete all the characters before I autocompleted the item. Great. Now my problem is when I have multiple entries already autocompleted. I want to be able to delete each entry with a single backspace rather than deleting each character individually. I have tried using a TextWatcher but couldnt really get that to go anywhere. Is there a way I could tokenize each entry as its own entity rather than appending it to a string like google hangouts and facebook do. Note this isnt a requirement, just a thought of how i could do it. Thanks for any help Ill post here if I find out more.p

Negative 3227 pHi Im working with JQuery fullCalendar in Angularjs and need some help with some table styling. The fullcalendar uses its own css file from the plugin that can be seen a hrefhttpcdnjs.cloudflare.comajaxlibsfullcalendar2.4.0fullcalendar.css relnofollowherea.p  pThe problem is that in the projectwebsite there are others stylesheets, among them a stylesheet created to make tables responsive. I cant control which stylesheets the HTML has access to. And this makes the calendar use an entirely other unlogical styling in small window size.p  pSo is there any possible way to force the controller to look away from some stylesheets or style the calendar own stylesheet in such a way that it will be the controlling stylep  pEdit Forgot to say that the aforementioned stylesheet is styling tables in general without any classnames and since its very much used throughout the website changing that into classes isnt really viable at this point.p
Negative 3227 pI want to create a website using python without cms system, that is, say no to Django, Plesk, and the etc. I want to use fusion table to do sql search on page urls. And print out html and JavaScript files to the public  folder by python. I dont mind to reinvent the wheel. What is the strategy here. Can someone point to me to some web which implements this. Simply use google api as an interface. I also consider create a json server and use my own api to get and post data if fusion table api is limited. However its not at this stage. I simply dont like the idea of cms. Basically, you can not change specific pages layout in cms. Why is it so prevalent Can someone give me some guidance here. Another reason cms is bad is because of size limit. Database is a file. How big can a file be 16Tb is the limit possibly. I am aiming for 1000Tb with 100 millions pages here.p

The PlayerGameStates, name hannes2 that is mentioned in the error messages is the parent of another entity GameState, which have been codegetasynccodeed from the database a few lines earlierp  precode GameState is read by getasync gamestatefuture  GameState.getbyidasyncid, ndb.KeyPlayerGameStates, playerkey ... gamestate  gamestatefuture.getresult ... codepre  pWeird thing is, there are no writes to the datastore occurring for that entity. My understanding is that contention errors can come if the same entity is updated at the same time, in parallell.. Or maybe if too many writes occur, in a short period of time..p  pBut can it happen when reading entities also suspended generator get.. And, is this happening after the 5 ndb.transaction retries.. I cant see anything in the log that indicates that any retries have been made.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p
