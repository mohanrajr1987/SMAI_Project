It uses mobile device orientation to rotate the camera inside a sphere and also allows the user to manually drag the sphere on touch.p  pHowever, when user releases the touch, camera jumps back to device rotation.

Positive 63659 pI have numerous potentially long polylines or short, vertices count is highly volatile to display, so I was thinking about packing them in a bunch of fixed size lets say 10000 vertices position BufferAttribute and sending one drawcall per polyline. And if a polyline crosses the 10000 limit boundary, I can just split it, repeat the last vertex from the previous buffer as the first vertex of the new buffer and carry on with multiple THREE.Line objects.p  pMy understanding is that a drawcall is defined by addGroup in the recent three.js, but I have troubles understanding the link with setDrawRange.p  pI replaced setDrawRange by addGroup in this example a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net1v00pxx5 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net1v00pxx5a and it doesnt animate anymore  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions31399856drawingalinewiththreejsdynamicallyDrawing a line with three.js dynamicallya .p  pI replaced p  precodeline.geometry.setDrawRange 0, drawCount  codepre  pby p  precodeline.geometry.clearGroups line.geometry.addGroup 0, drawCount  codepre  pIt looks like I misunderstood something, because its rendering everything instead of just the single group I was defining.p  pHere is my crazy context I am building a chrome packaged application that accesses the USB, and both webgl and USB have to be on the main JS thread, but sometimes when uploading the geometries to webgl, it starves the USB, and I cant use a bigger USB buffer because the device on the other side of the usb cable doesnt have enough memory.p

Positive 63659 pI originally had an animate function in place for my three.js scene that is loaded within an AngularJS Modal, but found that after closing the Modal, the animation keeps going, and that is unneeded since I dont require constant animation like a video game would have. p  pAt this point, I switched it to only render when someone uses the OrbitControls to move the simple box in my example, and have an initial call to render the scene so that users can see the box instead of a big blacked out square. p  pHowever, upon initial render, the texture does not appear to be applied until I use the orbit controls and move the box, at which point they appear. This is odd, since both my initial call and the listener tied to the OrbitControls are to the same function.

Positive 63659 pSo if any THREE.js pros can understand why I cant get the WebGLRenderTarget to be used as a material for a plane in another scene Id be pretty happy.p  pHow it works right now is I create a scene with a perspective camera which renders a simple plane. This happens in the Application object.p  pI also have a WaveMap object that uses another scene and an orthographic camera and using a fragment shader draws the cosx  siny function on another quad that takes up the entire screen. I render this to a texture and then I create a material that uses this texture.p  pI then pass that Material to be used in the Application object to draw the texture on the first plane I mentioned.p  pProblem is for some reason I could get this to work in the scene with the orthographic camera inside the WaveMap object but not in the scene with the perspective camera in the Application object after passing the material over. p  pIve tried simply passing a simple material with a solid color and that works but when I try to pass over a material which uses a WebGLRenderTarget as a texture it doesnt show up anymore.p  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comArminTaherirendertotexturethreejs relnofollowhttpsgithub.comArminTaherirendertotexturethreejsap
Positive 63659 pI have an issue regarding the Raycaster model. I understand the idea and the fact that it intersects meshes, which I can transform, but for example, if I create JS objects that have an inner THREE.Object3D that groups meshes for their UI, how can I know when the corresponding eminstanceem of an object is clickedp  pImagine a button. This button has several characteristics and an inner model that holds its THREE.js graphical form lets say a boxGeometry and a textGeometry that build this button. When the button is added to the scene it adds its buttonInstance.getModel to the scene, and adds itself to a repository of objects to keep a reference to it.p  pIf I wanted to click this button, I create a raycaster and get the intersecting objects from an array of buttons Objects 3D or Meshes that represent this object. p  pBut how do I fire an event or interact with the button instance itself I have the mesh but cant get the idea on how to link it with the instance itself.p  pAny clues Ive searched a lot about raycasting in THREE, but all the examples relate to changing colors or positions of meshes. p  precode    raycaster.setFromCameranew THREE.Vector20,0, camera     activeBtns  raycaster.intersectObjectsbuttons, true     activeBtns[0].object.parent.position.setcurPos.x, curPos.y, curPos.z.2  alter position of the Object3D that holds textMesh and BoxMesh codepre  pBut how do I even know which button is this one that has been clicked if all buttons have two meshes and I dont see a way of idetifying them once they are in the scenep  pThanksp  pdp

Positive 63659 pIm trying to identify when a collision occurs between two meshes Ive created. The problem is that one of the meshes is nested into a bunch of codeTHREE.Object3Dcode objects, so the collision isnt being detected.

Positive 63659 pI have a threejs r.67 application where I load skinned meshesfrom sea3d with vary large animations. tens of thousands of frames. When I remove one of the meshes and try to load a new one, I get OOM errors for recursive function. I dont have any recursive functions other than a render.

Is there a way to remove the animation arrays so that I am not getting the OOMp  pHere is a jsFiddle of what I am working with. You can load the different sea files using the Load Strength and Load Reflex buttons. After alternatively loading the files you will get an OOM.

Negative 63659 pIm writing a data processing library in Python that reads data from a variety of sources into memory, manipulates it, then exports it into a variety of different formats.  I was loading this data into memory, but some of the datasets Im processing can be particularly large over 4 Gig.p  pI need an open source library for a backing store that can deal elegantly with large datasets.  It needs the ability to alter the data structure dynamically add, rename, and remove columns, and should support reasonably fast iteration.  Ideally, it should be able to handle arbitrarysized strings and integers just as python does but I can build that into the library, if needed.

Negative 63659 pI need to execute a bunch of up to 1000000 sql statements on an Oracle database. These statements should result in a referentially consistent state at the end, and all the statements should be rolled back if an error occurs. These statements do not come in a referential order. So if foreign key constraints are enabled, one of the statements may cause a foreign key violation even though, this violation would be fixed with a statement that would be executed later on.p  pI tried disabling foreign keys first and enabling them after all statements were executed. I thought I would be able to roll back when there was an actual foreign key violation. I was wrong though, I found out that every DDL statement in Oracle started with a commit, so there was no way to rollback the statements this way. Here is my script for disabling foreign keysp  precodebegin    for i in select constraintname, tablename from userconstraints             where constrainttype R and status  ENABLED      LOOP execute immediate alter table i.tablename disable constraint                             i.constraintname    end loop end codepre  pAfter some research, I found out that it was recommended to execute DDL statements, like in this case, in an autonomous transaction. So I tried to run DDL statements in an autonomous transaction. This resulted in the following errorp  pORA00054 resource busy and acquire with NOWAIT specifiedp  pI am guessing this is because the main transaction still has DDL lock on the tables.p  pAm I doing something wrong here, or is there any other way to make this scenario workp
Negative 63659 pI know Exception Handling is a very important thing and we are doing it in all our projects. The main reason is to log errors that occur at the customers.

I want the debugger stop right at the line the application crashed and not in some error logger I wrote.

Negative 63659 pMy system sends out messages to users email, sms, etc. It currently sends it for every event which is only once a day at most, but Id like to add in a form of digest to it where a user can select to have a weekly or monthly digest of their messages. Im looking to see if there are any existing opensource solutions for this, or existing patterns for implementing something like this. p  pMy system does not persist any of the messages, they are sent out on an as needed basis and then forgotten. So that is the first thing that will need to happen. Id also like to be able to create a message page on the site that will display a history of all messages.p  pThen there needs to be the mechanism that looks at the user preference on messages and decides when to send the messages and how to group them up into a digest form if needed.p  pAny pointers or thoughts would be appreciated.p

Negative 63659 pI have a few questions about the linkage from the following variables.

And b also implies internal linkage, because the name a is declared static by a. pli lipFirst codeexterncode, then codestaticcodep  precodeextern int b  c static int b  d invalid codepre  pFirst, c implies external linkage. But d implies internal linkage because the name b is declared static by d. This is invalid according to 7.1.17, since the linkage implied is not consistent. pli lipFirst codeconstcode, then codeexterncodep  precodeconst double pi1  3.14  e extern const double pi1  f valid and pi1 is internal codepre  pFirst, e implies internal linkage, because it is const, and neither declared explicit extern nor previously implied external linkage. And f should imply extern linkage and be an error, because it explicitly declares the name extern, but the compilers keep it internal strongWhy sostrong emThats my question.empli lipFirst codeexterncode, then codeconstcodep  precodeextern const double pi2  g const double pi2  3.14  h valid and pi2 is external codepre  pNow, g implies external linkage because we explicitly declared extern. And h also implies external linkage because g explicitly declared extern. pli ol  hr  pI have experimentally found out the linkage for 3 and 4 with the following template the second argument is required to have external linkagep  precodetemplatelttypename T, Tampgt struct ensure    ensureltconst double, pi1gt e1  failed ensureltconst double, pi2gt e2  succeeded codepre  hr  pstrongSummarystrong The Discussion with a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers19563charlesbaileyCharles Baileya turned out to be quite fruitful and showed there are two possible interpretations of code3.53code, where the important bullet point readsp  blockquote   pA name having namespace scope 3.3.5 has internal linkage if it is the name ofp      ul   lian object or reference that is explicitly declared const and neither explicitly declared extern nor   previously declared to have external linkage li   ul blockquote  pIf we look at point codefcode, then the two interpretations come to different conclusions, as shown belowp  ol lipThe first interpretation notes that codepi1code is declared codeconstcode but is also declared codeexterncode. The variable has thus emexternalem linkage. pli lipThe second interpretation interpretes both occurences of declared to refer to the same declaration. In this way, it means that it emis declared codeconstcode, but not codeextern constcodeem. We note that codeecode is declared codeconstcode and not codeextern constcode, thus we give codepi1code internal linkage. pli ol  pNow what interpretation is correct I cant determine from that wording, but compilers seem to interpret this the second way. In particular, if we take the first interpretation, then the last quoted part of code3.53code would be superfluous, because there would be no valid scenario in which a name would be declared codeconstcode and previously declared with external linkage but without an explicit codeexterncode. p

Negative 63659 pIm pretty new to Android app development, and Ive been playing around with swipe gestures using Androids SimpleOnGestureListener and a ViewFlipper.  There are 3 children of the ViewFlipper, and each is a ScrollView.  Theyre all dynamically populated when the Activity loads, and they dont change after that.  The ScrollView is where the SimpleOnGestureListeners are attached.  p  pHeres the layout Im usingbr ViewFlipperbr ScrollView x3, one for each page, each with the followingbr LinearLayout verticalbr TextViewbr TableLayout dynamically populated wTableRowsbr View  p  pI extended the onFling method with the common tutorial code you can find anywhere online, and it works greatexcept when one of the ScrollViews doesnt contain enough content to scroll.  p  pIve narrowed the problem down to touch detection by overriding and calling super on every one of the SimpleOnGestureListeners methods to add a printtolog.  p  pWhen I swipe on a page that scrolls, I get something full of in onClick in onScroll in onFling etc.  On a page thats too short to scroll, I get in onClick in onShowPress in onLongPress, and thats only if Im touching the content emwithinem the tooshort scrollviews childrenif I touch elsewhere I get no events at all.  p  pIdeas on whats wrong, or how to detect the swipe gesture no matter how big the ScrollView isp  pEDIT  Ive determined that when I run this on an Android 2.2 emulator, as opposed to the Android 2.1u1 DroidX emulator Ive been using, it goes away.  This is reproducible across multiple environments.p  hr  pI have some more insight on this  it seems as though onInterceptTouchEvent is not called for every motion event when a scrollview is contained within a flipper or a WorkspaceView.p  pIn particular, the behavior I found while modifying another view class to fix this very same issue it is not unique to flippers was as followsnote that this is Android 2.1 onlyp  pIf the scrollview is long enough to scroll, the ACTIONDOWN motion event is caught by the ScrollView, and every subsequent ACTIONMOVE event goes through onInterceptTouchEvent of the flipper, where it is intercepted and handled appropriately.  In android 2.2, this behavior happens regardless of the scroll length.p  pBack to 2.1  If the scrollview is not long enough to scroll, the ACTIONDOWN motion event is emnotem caught by the scrollview, but instead comes back to the onTouchEvent of the flipper.  All subsequent ACTIONMOVE events of the same gesture emskipem the onInterceptTouchEvent function and go straight to the onTouchEvent functionp  pThe way I resolved this was to take the functionality I had in onTouchEvent for ACTIONMOVE events and refactor it into its own method.  In this way, I can have onTouchEvent call onInterceptTouchEvent followed by that functionality if it detects that the event has previously gone unhandled.p  precodecase MotionEvent.ACTIONMOVE                  if touchState  TOUCHSTATESCROLLING                      handleScrollMoveev                  else                    Log.dworkspace,caught a move touch event but not scrolling                     NOTE  We will never hit this case in Android 2.2.  This is to fix a 2.1 bug.                     We need to do the work of interceptTouchEvent here because we dont intercept the move                     on children who dont scroll.

In the case that we receive a move event, and we are scrolling which only happens if we have deliberately chosen to intercept itie, its set in the intercept function, so weve been to the intercept function already we perform the move behavior we desire.

Negative 63659 pDue to circumstances beyond my control, my production Camping site appears at codemysite.example.commysitecode.  Im pretty sure this is a common Apache  Passenger configuration issue, and Im not interested in how to fix it right now because the server is out of my control.  Suffice to say, the controller for  points there and I cant change that any time soon.p  pNow, for a long time, this wasnt an issue, because codeRMyIndexControllercode points to the correct place.  However, I serve my sites CSS using a codeRackStaticcode call to make SITEROOTpublic accessible.  This means that the stylesheet is at codemysite.example.commysitecssstyle.csscode.  Heres where the problem comes in the Camping codeURLcode method, when called in my layout, gives codehttpmysite.example.comcode, not codehttpmysite.example.commysitecode.  So I cant get it to point to the css subdirectory, because its missing a hop in the middle.  When I run rackup locally, everything is fine because this file is at codelocalhost8080cssstyle.csscode, but on the production server I dont know how to fix it.p  pMy question is there another method maybe directly from Rack that I should be calling instead  I really want to avoid hardcoding it, andor having a hack to determine whether Im running locally for debug or in production, for every rendering of the layout.p  pETA OK, this gets stranger.  Obviously Ive abstracted out some of the actual details above, part of which I think I overscrubbed.  The top level URL is actually more akin to codemysiterestcode the developercentric HTML presentation of our RESTful interface, as opposed to codemysitemanagementcode accounts or codemysiteuicode JQueryd  nice UI.  These are set up in our config.ru, via coderun RackURLMap.newHash[rest gt RestModule, ui gt PrettyInterfaceModule, management gt UserManagerModule]code, etc.p  pSo in answer to the comment below, RIndex, from a view in the RestModule, actually returns codemysiterestcode.  As an example, I have a home link in the layout, which looks like codea hrefgtRIndexcode, and generates code that looks like codelta hrefmysiterestgtcode.  The server is configured to serve files from .public directly at the site root, so code.publiccssstyle.csscode actually does apppear at codehttpmysite.example.commysitecssstyle.csscode, as noted previously.  Its emthatem link that Im having trouble automatically generating, and its because of the RackURLMap that I thought I may have to rely on a native Rack method not a Camping abstraction to locate this resource.p

Negative 63659 pIm trying to change the way we handle uploaded files before storing them to disk. We have had some problems when users from nonwindows operative systems upload files with characters that are illegal in windows file names.p  ol lipThe idealist in me tells me that file names should be made legal as close to the web layer as possible. Thus we use the same correct file name throughout the business logic and data layer.  In practice this requires us to actively sanitise file names several places and then trust this later on. This is a problem as it is much more prone to programmer mistakes unless you only have one entry point for files from the web. pli lipThe other option I see is wrapping the file IO using sanitation methods on file names. This is not possible to do in an invisible way as we sometimes need to store file names in the DB. If the file name is not changed until it is stored to disk the DB will contain the wrong file name. This again wouldnt matter if all calls to the file system went through the same file name sanitation methods except that in practice your operations department will want to do some scripted jobs to move files sometimes by reading file names from DB.pli ol  pA way to get around option two is to return the new file name if it was changed by the sanitation. This requires the user of the method be aware of this and handle it correctly. Like thisp  precodepublic static FileStream CreateFilestring filename, out string newFileName      newFileName  FileNameSanitiser.GetSanitisedFullPathfilename     return System.IO.File.CreatenewFileName  codepre  pRegarding option 1 we should have only one or two file upload endpoints. This would have made this option more feasible. I think it might be worth investing time in this, but Im not sure my manager agrees... p

I have added the directory containing the .lib files to the Additional Library Directories, and I have added the names of the libraries to the Additional Dependencies entry under Linker  Input.p  pWhen I compile and link, I get errors in this style error LNK2019 unresolved external symbol cvFloodFill referenced in function int cdecl Labelclass cvImage amp LabelYAHAAVcvImageMZp  pUnder LinkerCommand Line  Additional options, I added the tag verboselib and I see in the compiler output window that it is searching and finding the library that should contain the functions cv210d.lib. I looked in the source for OpenCV and found that the function in question is defined in this libraryp  p1Linking...br 1Searching librariesbr 1    Searching CProgram FilesOpenCV2.1libcv210d.libp  pIn the OpenCV source, it has the extern C declaration wrapping the declaration of the functions in question.p  pI ran dumpbin all on the library file, and I see the following symbols defined. I have the gnu tool chain for windows installed, so I can use grep.p  pCProgram FilesOpenCV2.1libdumpbin all cv210d.lib  grep cvFloodFillbr     732B4 impcvFloodFillebr     732B4 cvFloodFillbr       1CA impcvFloodFillbr       1CA cvFloodFill  p  pSo, as you can see, the linker is looking for the symbol cvFloodFill, but that is not defined. only cvFloodFill and impcvFloodFill are defined, so it looks like something funny is happening that is making the namemangling different when I compile the library vs when I try to link against it. p  pSo that is where I am stuck. Am I interpreting this information correctly Is there something I need to do to affect the namemangling Do I need to compile the library with different flags of some sortp

Negative 63659 pI am trying to create a fullscreen minimalistic text editor by minimalistic I mean having only a blinking caret, black background, keyboard control by arrows to move around the text, backspace delete, etc. and thats it. I have created a RenderWindow, I have a global string buffer for text and I am using String2D class to visualize it on screenI am developing it in C using VC2010 and a hrefhttpwww.sfmldev.org relnofollowSFMLa .NET package.p  pBasicaly what I do is catching keystrokes, checking if they come from letters, digits or any other written symbols useful in writting and add or subtract them from the string buffer which is permanently visualised onscreen using RenderWindows draw.p  pNow the problem is, how can I implement the correct caret movement controlled by arrows. If somebody would like to move around the whole screen of text using downupleftright arrow. For leftright movement in one line of text it is easy, might implement a counter to know after which character should I reneder caret. Nevertheless, eventualy I am gonna have to break lines where screen ends and what then, how can I correctly discover where to render the caret if somebody wants to go line down or up and how to know which position it is in string because somebody could add or delete a portion of text afterwards. Or maybe my approach is completely wrong  Please advise.p

Negative 63659 pI have been able to build rabbitmq server on ubuntu linux. It came already prepackaged and on making, it is able to start as a service. When i got the client source, i failed to make because it appeared like it needed a folder called .depsrabbitmqserver. Analysing the code, i find that the author of the client was accessing the same header files as are found in the server, using includelibpath to rabbit.hrl e.t.c in his header file called amqpclient.hrl. I then decided to add rabbitmqserver in the lib dir of erlang so as its paths are automatically added on start up of the vm. But still this didnot help. There is also another folder which the client references called rabbitcommon for an include folder he assumes would contain all the .hrl files there. Please assist me in building both the client and server on my ubuntu server, for testing. p  pAlso, if anyone has used RabbitMQ server for IMs, please provide some benchmarks andor your findings on its throughput, speed and number of users.

Negative 63659 pIve been playing with Java for years as a means of developing quick and easy tools for repetitive tasks.  I am not a true developer in the traditional sense, but I have lots of experience creating a wide assortment of tools and PoCs.p  pUnfortunately for me, I have noticed many shops are specifically looking for experience with C, and not so many for Java.  Even here on SO, there are more questions and more followers to C related issues than Java.  My preference will always be Java over C simply for the crossplatform compatibility, but since the languages are so similar, I believe it would be beneficial for me to crosstrain.  I have already dabbled in other languages and scripts VB and other BASIC flavors, Javascript, VBScript, ASP, JSP, PHP, etc. so adding another isnt out of the question.p  pMy current Java environment simply consists of a text editor primarily jEdit for its plugins and layout and homemade scripts to compilejar my projects.  I dont like to use IDEs because I want full control over my code and dont want a program writing code for me.  I also prefer to write my own code as opposed to using any sort of external librarypackage, if feasible.  It helps me learn and greatly reduces unnecessary code.p  pTherefore, what are my options for a nonIDE C SDK  Libraries are obviously not that important to me.  Ive heard of Mono, which appears to separate the functions, but havent tried it yet.  What other SDKs exist that are similar to a simple Java SDK combined with a text editorp

Negative 63659 pI have a very large code that sets up and iteratively solves a system of nonlinear partial differential equation, written in fortran.  I need all variables to be double precision.  In the additional module that I have written for the code, I declare all variables as the double precision type, but my module still uses variables from the old source code that are declared as type real.  So my question is, what happens when a singleprecision variable is multiplied by a double precision variable in fortran  Is the result double precision if the variable used to store the value is declared as double precision  And what if a double precision value is multiplied by a constant without the D0 at the end  Can I just set a compiler option in Intel 11.1 to make all realdouble precisionconstants of double precisionp

Negative 63659 pI have a small problem.  I need to rebuild a version of linux so that it matches a version built a while ago.

This version is just block copied onto blank hard disks.  If I use a development box I can successfully rebuild the kernel so it is a byte for byte match with the original that I am trying to reproduce.p  pBut I need to prove to a government body that we have done nothing bad to the kernel, so they require us to build the linux kernel on a machine that has been installed from scratch using only trust software.  Trusted means downloaded from official web sites and verified via hashing results.  A machine built in this manner produces a kernel that differs from that built on the development box and therefore differs from the original I am trying to match.p  pWhat variables may affect the outcome of the build  At present these are the same across the two boxes trusted and developmentp  ul liGCC versionli liRun time kernelli lisource of kernel I am trying to rebuild including .configs filesli ul  pAny ideas on what create the differencesp

I need to add some custom validation to thiscmsNode class that checks to make sure the name is not already taken by any other node that has the same ParentId.  p  pIn order to do that I need to get a handle on an instance member named ParentId.  Unfortunately, I cant figure out how to get a handle on the instance Im validating from the cmsNodeMetadata class. p  pSo I tried changing my approach by overriding the onChanging method for the Name Property in my cmsNode class and adding the validation there but that caused another issue.  While I am able to check the name property using the override method of validation I get exceptions when the Name comes back unset from the view because my entity model does not except null values for the Name property and Im not able to catch it because the contents of the view are converted to the model type in the input parameter of my controller.p  pThen I tried using both but the MetadatatType and the onChanging methods of validation together but the onChanging method is ignored.  p  pI realize that I could solve this problem in the following wayp  ul liI could change the return type of the controller to FormCollection collection, a dto object, or define input properties directly and utilize and then create the object in the controller after I check for a null value which is fine.li ul  pIm just wondering am I missing something  Is there a way to validate the property and check for duplicate names using ValidationAttributes  Can I prevent Nulls from coming back from my view Why doesnt the onChanging method in entity framework have a Cancel option to prevent a member from being set if the validation doesnt work out  Thanks for your helpp
Negative 63659 pIm working with only one txt file which is about 4 MB, and the file needs frequently IO such as append new linessearch for certain lines which includes specific phrasesreplace certain line with another line etc. p  pIn order to process the file at the same time, codethreading.RLockcode is used to lock the resource when its under operation.

Negative 63659 pWe have a number of interrelated systems that share a common service layer.  In addition, they are a number of common UI components.  To reduce cut and paste, wed like to package up the code for use in all current and future projects.  Currently, the projects that well need to integrate with are ASP.net webforms and MVC 3 solutions.   Id like folks input on the best way to proceed.p  pOne implementation would be to create a separate web project mvc and have it share a common session with the other applications.  The benefit to this model would be that upgrades to the common component would not require all the applications call the common elements to be reinstalled.  Unluckily, code separation for the common components user and org management isnt so simple.  p  pAnother method would be to wrap the code in a nuget package.  For the WebForms projects, I could be wrapped with the AddMvc3ToWebForms.  For the straight MVC projects it could just be installed as a folder.p  pany other alternatives  Id love to get a more plugable solution e.g., MEFContrib but Im not familar enough with MVC to determine how to do it.p  pAny ideas would be appreciated..p

Negative 63659 pI am trying to use Z3 to reason about substrings, and have come across some nonintuitive behavior. Z3 returns sat when asked to determine if xy appears within xy, but it returns unknown when asked if x is in x, or x is in xy. p  pIve commented the following code to illustrate this behaviorp  precodesetlogic AUFLIA declaresort Char 0  characters to build strings are x and y declarefun x  Char declarefun y  Char assert distinct x y  string literals declarefun findMeX  Array Int Char   declarefun findMeXY  Array Int Char   declarefun x  Array Int Char declarefun xy  Array Int Char declarefun length  Array Int Char  Int   set findMeX  x assert  select findMeX 0 x assert  length findMeX 1  set findMeXY  xy assert  select findMeXY 0 x assert  select findMeXY 1 y assert  length findMeXY 2  set x  x assert  select x 0 x assert  length x 1  set xy  xy assert  select xy 0 x assert  select xy 1 y assert  length xy 2 codepre  pNow that the problem is set up, we try to find the substringsp  precodesearch for findMeXx in xx   push 1 assert    exists      offset Int      and        lt offset  length x length findMeX        gt offset 0        forall          index Int          gt            and              lt index length findMeX              gt index 0                          select x  index offset              select findMeX index  checksat sat expected, unknown returned pop 1 codepre  pIf we instead search for codefindMeXYcode in codexycode, the solver returns sat, as expected.

Negative 63659 pI was wondering if there is a way that I can animate my GridViews Children to their new positions.

Negative 63659 pI am developing a web app and I need to have the main script running in the background  as a deamon  and handle many requests from the same user.p  pMy application performs many SQL queries and generates huge arrays for its internal workings,  and this is done for every single request from the user. My goal is to keep the application running in the background and let it respond to the user requests, thus improving performance and easing on the server resources once the user logs off I can then, kill the deamon.p  pI thought of using pcntlfork but it only works for CLI  if my understanding is correct p  pAny help will be highly appreciated Thank you.p  pYounes. p
Negative 63659 pGood afternoon everyone I have recently started evaluating Dapper as a potential replacement for EF, since I was not too pleased with the SQL that was being generated and wanted more control over it.  I have a question regarding mapping a complex object in my domain model.  Lets say I have an object called Provider, Provider can contain several properties of type IEnumerable that should only be accessed by going through the parent provider object i.e. aggregate root.  I have seen similar posts that have explained using the QueryMultiple and a Map extension method but was wondering how if I wanted to write a method that would bring back the entire object graph eager loaded, if Dapper would be able to do this in one fell swoop or if it needed to be done piecemeal.  As an example lets say that my object looked something like the followingp  precodepublic AggregateRoot                   public int Id getset            ...simple properties            public IEnumerableltFoogt Foos            public IEnumerableltBargt Bars            public IEnumerableltFooBargt FooBars            public SomeOtherEntity Entity            ...        codepre  pIs there a straightforward way of populating the entire object graph using Dapper  Any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 63659 pI develop an iPhone IOS app which involves turning on the background music. I decided to choose the AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer for this purpose.p  pSo what I have is two view controllers and one nsobject controller that is actually a Music controller all the methods with AVFramework are written therep  precode  AVMusicController.h  import ltAVFoundationAVFoundation.hgt  interface AVMusicController  NSObject ltAVAudioPlayerDelegategt      AVAudioPlayer avMusicPlayer   propertynonatomic, retain AVAudioPlayer avMusicPlayer  voidplayMusic voidmuteMusic voidunMuteMusic  end codepre  pAnd implementation of this class.p  pSo the first view controller turns the background music on when the view loads i managed to do that and it has a button to go to the other view which is controlled by the second view controller. The second one has the button to mute the music. So here is my problem I load the AVMusicController into second view controller, make the nsobject in the second view xib file, change its controller to AVMusic controller and connect to the files owner. p  pBut when I write the codep  precodeIBActionbuttonPressed          [self.avMusicController muteMusic]  codepre  pIt doesnt mute the music. Although, when I do the same in the first view controller which turns the music on create a button and write the same code  everything works.p  pPlease, suggest me any ideas on this problem. Thank your for your attention.p  pIf any part of my question confuses you, please let me know and I will change it. Thank you in advance.p

Negative 63659 pI set up my app so that it runs in UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight and UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft.  I have set those values in my plist file, and in my shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation, it will only return YES for those orientations.  p  pThis works perfectly for the most part, except on the iPad, where if I held it in LandscapeLeft during launch, my app would end up in portrait mode unless I turn the iPad to LandscapeRight to invoke an orientation change.p  pLooking through the log, it became evident that willAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientation takes place before applicationDidBecomeActive gets called.  I changed my code so that shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation returns YES for any orientation before applicationDidBecomeActive is called and return YES for my landscape orientations only after applicationDidBecomeActive is called.  Now my app would launch properly in LandscapeLeft as well.  However it doesnt feel right that I should fix it this way and I have no idea why iPad is behaving the way it did.  Would appreciate it if somebody can explain this bit of oddity to me.p
Negative 63659 pQuick bit of background to the project in question its C .Net 4, WinForms with smart client factory and unfortunately a lot of visual inheritance.p  pHeres a brief outline of the problem the team Im working on are experiencing which seems to be fairly intermittentp  pSomeone will open up one of the client module projects to begin work on one of the views, double click on the view to open up the designer and Visual Studio will give them a design time error such asp  pa hrefhttpwww.freeimagehosting.netf0be0 relnofollowimg srchttpwww.freeimagehosting.netnewuploadsf0be0.jpgap  pTheres no way back from this if you rebuild from here without doing the following work around then the error will still persist. The only work around weve found is to clean the client solution, close Visual Studio you bhaveb to do that, reopen Visual Studio and rebuild the solution. Next time you try to open the view it will work. But the error will come back again  it seems to be after bXb amount of rebuilds possibly only while the view is open in the designer whilst youre building the solutionp  pNo one has taken the time out to really dig into this problem and at the moment no one has the time So I was wondering bit of a long shot if anyone might have an idea about what could be going on Or perhaps an inkling of where to start digging once we get a bit of time to look into thisp

Negative 63659 pIm at the end of my wisdom...p  pI have a view which should display an animated circular section which is prerendered and available as png files both retina and nonretina versions, correctly named piep000.png vs. piep0002x.png. This section should be animated according the change to some percentage value within the app. So I made a subclass of UIView which has a custom CALayer within its layer hierarchy. The plan is to implement a custom animatable property for the CALayer subclass and change pictures in the overridden method drawInContext. So far so good, the plan worked and the animation is shown when I change the percentage value using the function setPercentageWithFloat of the view full source below. The thing is I really dont know why my iPhone4 always presents the lowres image. I tried already playing around with scale factors, but that didnt help. Either the images are presented in the right size and lowres or the images are presented double size. Overriding display and setting the contents property directly has the effect that the animation doesnt appear during the animation no image is presented after the animation time the final image is presented. In this case the correct resolution image is presented.p  pBtw the following code is not very sophisticated in errorhandling, flexibility and elegance yet as it is an attempt just to get that thing running   so the image is still presented flipped and so on...p  pI hope that somebody has a hint for me.

Negative 63659 pIm using the MailSystem.NET OS library for handling IMAP.  I have a problem with my client program written in c.  It polls the mail server using the IMAP library.  It marks a message as deleted after adding it into the client db.

Negative 63659 pHere goesp  pI have a AWS S3 bucket with a folder and a mobile application.p  pI want to create a servlet in between these 2 such that the architecture isp  pPhone  lt  Servlet lt  S3p  pI dont want the phone to have direct access to the S3 and so the servlet will have the Access Key and Secret Key to do the uploading to and downloading from the S3 bucket using the credentials.p  pI want the phone to have a preview of the picture first, meaning he loads the image url like a hrefhttpss3.amazon.comabcabc.jpg relnofollowhttpss3.amazon.comabcabc.jpga and and caches it in the phone. Previously I set the bucket policy to public so anyone has access to the picture but now I want to secure it, thus the additional layer of the servlet in between.p  pMy idea is to have the phone send a POST request to the servlet. Servlet after authenticating the phone user will use the credentials to download the file from the S3 bucket. Servlet will then base64 encode the file and send it to the phone for display.p  pMy question is, is there a better way to handle this For example Send a POST to the servlet. Servlet authenticates and somehow using the credentials, redirects the phone to the image url link on the bucket so that I can skip the base64 encoding portion.p  pOr is there a better and proper way to do this Thanksp

It wont send the value belonging to the particular item if it is any other item than the first one.p  pThis is the code belonging to main.php that gets loaded via AJAX into a div and is looped with each product associated with a selected bulletinp  precode    echo ltform namemyDelFormgt     newsgenidltbrgt     ltinput typehidden iddelccode value.newsgenid.gt     ltinput typehidden     iddeledit value.edit.gt     ltinput typebutton onclickajaxDelCcode valueDelete gtltbrgtltformgt     lttdgt codepre  pThe AJAX code on index.php, where the div that calls in main.php is also located is thisp  precodefunction ajaxDelCcode     var ajaxRequest   The variable that makes Ajax possible try      Opera 8.0, Firefox, Safari     ajaxRequest  new XMLHttpRequest  catch e      Internet Explorer Browsers     try         ajaxRequest  new ActiveXObjectMsxml2.XMLHTTP      catch e          try             ajaxRequest  new  ActiveXObjectMicrosoft.XMLHTTP          catch e              Something went wrong             alertYour browser broke             return false                 Create a function that will receive data sent from the server ajaxRequest.onreadystatechange  function         ifajaxRequest.readyState  4         var ajaxDisplay  document.getElementByIdajaxMain2         ajaxDisplay.innerHTML  ajaxRequest.responseText       var deledit  document.getElementByIddeledit.value var delccode  document.getElementByIddelccode.value var queryString  delccode  delccode  ampdeledit  deledit ajaxRequest.openGET, main.php  queryString, true ajaxRequest.sendnull   gt ltscriptgt codepre  pCurrently, using those two pieces of code, I can successfully delete only the first product.  The delccode variables do not seem to change when the products are looped although when I echo the variables during the loop, it is definitely changing to the appropriate value...its just not passing it correctly back to AJAX.p  pI tried taking the AJAX code, putting it inside the main.php product loop, and change the function name during each loop  so ajaxDelCcodenewsgenid  for example and also to the button itself so that it is calling the AJAX specific to it. And it works if you are visiting main.php directly...but not from index.php after main.php has been called into the div.p  pI cant figure out how to pass the correct looped value from main.php within the div, back to the AJAX code on index.phpp  pCan anyone help me with thisp  pThanks,p  pDustinp

Negative 63659 pMy web application utilizes page reloads in places where the page structure changes.p  pFor content changes initiated by the user it is all handled by Ajax.p  pHowever Im planning on removing all the page reloads and replacing them with ajax calls that simply update the page using innerHTML for the body and head tags.p  pTo do this I know have to manually call functions that are normally called by the onload event.p  pWhen I am done I will have a complete ajax applicaton. My question is, is this standard practice now....I see alot of applications where you do something and the whole page reloads, where even common elements are reloaded.p  pFor example go to Apple.com and hit on the first button you see Store...you will see the whole page reload even the menu bar that does not change is relaoded wasting bandwidth..p  pBecause I dont see other people using complete ajax solutions...I wonder if I am headed down a wrong path.p  pMy questionp  pIs a complete ajax based web applicatoin best practiceof course file uploads arent supported, omitting this, is it best practice.p  pIf so why do big sites not do it  I see few sites that actually employ ajax instead of page reloads.p  pThanks.p

Instead of keeping a boolean value to each hash table entry indicating if the entry is filled, I thought the hash value  which is stored with each entry  is sufficient for this information 0 ... empty,  0 ... set. There is another reason to carry this information as sentinel value inside the hashkeytable. Im trying to switch from a AoS Array of Structure to a SoA Structure of Array memory layout. Im trying this to avoid padding and to test if there are lesser cache misses. I hope in most cases the access to the hashkeytable is enough implied that the hash value provides the information if the entry is empty or not.br I also thought about reserving the most significant bit of the hash values for this information but this would reduce the area of possible hash values more than it is necessary. Theoretically the area would be reduced from 2sup64sup minus the seninal 0value to 2sup63sup.br One can read the question in the other way Given a set of 84 pseudorandom numbers, is there any number which cant be generated by XORing any subset of this set, and how to get it This number can be used as sentinel value.br Now, for what I need it I have developed a connect four game engine. There are 6 x 7 moves possible for player A and also for player B. Thus there are 84 possible moves therefore 84 random values needed. The hash value of a boardstate is generated by the precalculated random values in the following manner codehashboard  randomset[move1] XOR randomset[move2] XOR randomset[move3] ...codep
Negative 63659 pVery long story short, I have a need to place a WinForms Panel and an instance of an unmanaged class that draws on it in a separate thread to keep the main window responsive the SDK can sometimes take several seconds to come up with what it will draw, and while it is doing this it blocks the UI thread. I actually need many of these up to 32, but well talk about just one for now the concept should be able to be duplicated as many times as necessary.p  pWhat I think I need to do is start a new Thread that will new up a Panel, then start an ApplicationContext that isnt tied to anything in particular, and assign it to the Panel. Then, the Panel class should have a Dispose overload that will end the ApplicationContext, shutting down the message pump and terminating the thread.p  pWhat I need to know isp  ul liCan the Panel be placed inside an IContainer, or added to the Controls collection of any parent object Or, will doing this cause nonthreadsafe calls to be madeli liI have a static factory method on the class that creates new instances on new threads. I need to return a reference to that Panel created in the background thread from the method so I can work with it. Is there a better way to do so than to wait in a whilesleep loop for a variable defined locally in the static method to be set by the background threadli liDo I need to keep a reference to the Thread that owns the Panelli liAm I insane for trying thisli ul
Negative 63659 pI am writing ruby on rails application, which will have 2 different users types lets say sellers and buyers. I am using devise gem to handle authentication.p  pI dont want to use single table inheritance for 3 reasonsbr 1 I dont want to have a lot of columns in my user table I would have to store fields for both seller and buyer in one table, and they will have a lot of different filedsbr 2 I dont want to have a lot of null values in my databasebr 3 Keeping sellers and buyers separated will help to improve performance speedp  pI decided to create 2 separate models for sellers and buyers and generate devise for each of them. Long story short  it caused some troubles ie. difficulties with handling login with single form, using polymorphic associations for simple things like private message, keeping my code DRY etc.p  pbSo here is the questionbbr Do You think it would be good idea to create one model user with some common fields to easily handle authentication with devise and then have separate models sellers and buyers with belongsto and hasone associations to store more info.

Negative 63659 pSo i have been doing my best trying to absorb as much as i can about the Zend Framework which is pretty new to me, im about two weeks in since my first attempts and being doing well so far.p  pHowever i have run into a small issue i just cant figure out.p  pSo heres the deal, i have a standard Zend Framework project with a number of modules in it. Like this p  precode Project   Application    configs    controllers     IndexController     WMSController    forms    layouts    models    modules     content      controllers       IndexController      models      views      Bootstrap    views    bootstrap   public  etc.. codepre  pNow i have a simple test link set in the view for the WMSController wich is supposed to direct someone klicking it to the IndexController of the content module.p  precodelta hrefwmscontentgt test link to content moduleltagt codepre  pNow as you can probably see this link is NOT going to work since it is pointing towards localhostwmscontent which would be the content action in the WMSController which doesnt exist at this moment.p  pNow what i want to do is to make the wmscontent actually point towards the IndexController of the content module. Why Well i simply do not want a user to type localhostcontent to get to the content module which is part of the WMS. I want to force them to get trough the WMS controller first.p  pI have read numerous things about routing being the solution using the bootstrap or the autoloader but pretty much all of them simply help you with pointing a certain url to a specific action in a specific controller.p  pWhat i want is a url to point to a specific action in a specific controller in a specific module.p  pNOTE All the other controllers and views are still the default generated versions with no changes made to them yetp  pIf anyone could show me a code example of how this is done it would be much appreciatedp

Negative 63659 pI am trying to get straight in my head how tree traversals can be used to uniquely identify a tree, and the crux of it seems to be whether the tree is a vanilla Binary Tree BT, or if it also has the stricter stipulation of being a Binary Search Tree BST. This a hrefhttpwww.cmi.ac.inmadhavancoursesprogramming06lecture1221sep2006.txt relnofollowarticlea seems to indicate that for BTs, a single inorder, preorder and postorder traversal will not uniquely identify a tree uniquely means structure and values of keys in this context. Here is a quick summary of the article  p  pstrongBTsstrongbr 1. We can uniquely reconstruct a BT with preorder  inorder and postorder  inorder.br   2. We can also use preorder  postorder if we also stipulate that the traversals keeps track of the null children of a node.   p  pan open question for me is if the above is still true if the BT can have nonunique elements   p  pstrongBSTsstrongbr 3. We cannot use inorder for a unique id. We need inorder  preorder, or inorder  postorder.  p  pNow, finally my question is, can we use just preorder or just postorder to uniquely identify a BST I think that we can, since this question and a hrefhttpwww.leetcode.com201009savingbinarysearchtreetofile.html relnofollowanswera seems to say yes, we can use preorder, but any input much appreciated. p
Negative 63659 pAfter much pain, tears and pulling out of hair I have finally managed to merge my UIKit ARC enabled app with my Cocos2D game project.  Basically, I have a UIKit app that has amongst other things a button to play the Cocos2D game.  The button calls an action which sets up the director, eaglview and scenes, etc and the game works as it should.p  pWhen you die in the game I want to automatically return to the menu with the play game button in UIKit, but I am absolutely clueless as to how to achieve this.  Any ideasp  pThose of you kind enough to answer please bear in mind that I am kinda new to all this and its fine by me if you pretend you are talking to a 5 year old.p  pThanks in advance... p

Negative 63659 pI have developed one application which consists a set of activities and background service which will get the request from activities and process it and send back the data to the activities.p  pProblem When I tested this application on HTC flyer tab, it has some peculiar issues. When the application is launched the first time, it works as intended. Once I pressed the Home Or Back buttons of the device, the application goes to background correctly. However when I click the application icon again to relaunch the application, it starts the main activity but after that it closes the activity automatically and shows the home screen of the device. I put the log statement in onDestroy method of service and it is invoking in this scenario. I am unable to understand why the service closes when I launch the application second time.p  pDoes anyone having some idea why it is behaving like this on the HTC flyer tab Please provide some inputs.p

Negative 63659 pI have a general question about the linux scheduler and some other similar kernel system calls.p  pIs the linux scheduler considered a process and every call to the scheduler requires a context switch like its just another processp  pSay we have a clock tick which interrupts the current running user mode process, and we now have to call the scheduler. Does the call to the scheduler itself provokes a context switch Does the scheduler has its own set of registers and Uarea and whatnot which it has to restore at every call p  pAnd the said question applies to many other system calls. Do kernel processes behave like regular processes in regard to context switching, the only difference is that they have more permissions and access to the cpup  pI ask this because context switch overhead is expensive. And it sounds odd that calling the scheduler itself provokes a context switch to restore the scheduler state, and after that the scheduler calls another process to run and again another context switch.  p

If codeacode is a list of lists, you cannot, but instead have to do something like code[a[i] for i in x]code.p  pthanks.p
Negative 63659 pI have an executable function that I compiled which takes an input and spits out some outputs when I run it in a terminal. The function is written in C, and I know that its supposed to be much faster than matlab. But what if my matlab code is using this external function like its own, would the fact that its externally called make it slower in any wayp  pIm trying to debate if there is any point in me writing a matlab version of this function, when I could just execute it with system in matlab.p
Negative 63659 pI think I need some more assistance with the concept of floating. This time my question revolves around floating two or more elements to the left.

All other elements respond by wrapping around... but how does the concept of floating two elements apply to thisp  pHere is what I understand Say I have two DIVs, a and b.

Negative 63659 pThis is more of a general socket question.  In Java, if I have a ServerSocket bound to a specific port, say 4444, I understand that its listening for connection requests.  The accept method blocks until a connection request is received and it returns a new Socket to communicate with the client. The remote endpoint of the returned Socket is the IP address and port of the client.  p  pHowever, where Im getting confused is that the local port of the returned Socket is the same as the port number of the ServerSocket thats listening for requests in this case 4444.  I thought two sockets couldnt be bound to the same port  Wouldnt the returned Socket be a different port on the serverp

Negative 63659 pI am having trouble with hibernate and versioning. I am using Hibernate 3.6.7Final. Here is a code snippet from my DAO class it is called by Spring Beans that use the Transactional annotations, so it is not transactional itself, but to force the StaleObjectStateException, a flush is usedp  precodeOverride public void saveUser user      boolean saved  false     while saved          try              sessionFactory.getCurrentSession.saveOrUpdateuser             sessionFactory.getCurrentSession.flush             saved  true          catch StaleObjectStateException exc              sessionFactory.getCurrentSession.refreshuser                codepre  pThe version is a long value mapped like thisp  precodeltversion nameversion accessfield columnversion typelong unsavedvaluenull gt codepre  pThe problem is, that the user is never saved, and the code just loops forever. I debugged a little and it turns out that hibernate has a concept of an ActionQueue, and inside, it has inserts, updates and so on in separate collections. With every loop of the code above, the update collection grows by 1. It fails as it always tries to execute the update at index 0 in that collection, which is the stale one, and fails at that point, and doesnt try to perform the update with the refreshed version. Is there a way I can make this workp  pMaybe some background about what I want to do, so maybe someone smarter will be able to suggest a better solution suppose there is no versioning, and the user has a column that contains the invalid login count. This count grows by one with each failure, and gets reset with a successful login. We use it to introduce a timeout as to when the user can login after x unsuccessful attempts, so as to prevent a brute force on the accounts, but this is irrelevant here. Now, suppose the attacker uses an attack, in which the same user account can be accessed by multiple threads on the server, and when 2 threads read the user with the failure count, say, 2, then thread 1 updates it to 3, saves, then thread 2 updates it to 3, and saves  we just lost one unsuccessful attempt, which is a bug.p  pSo, in order to fix this, I wanted to introduce the versioning column, that would in this case serve no other purpose as to cause throwing an exception by thread 2 above, in which case, the operation would be retried potentially, but highly unlikely, in a loop  basically, this would introduce serialization of saving the users, but based on optimistic locking. This, as stated before, doesnt work.p  pCan anybody help me out with this Is this a good idea to start with Maybe there is a better way Why does the Hibernate snippet doesnt workp

Negative 63659 pI would like to implement a ViewPager which uses Fragments and can be swiped in a curcular motion e.g. Page AltBltCltA. I have read a couple of posts on how this is done, e.g. returning a fake count of how many elements there are and setting the position at the start in the middle. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11465815howtocreatecircularviewpagerhow to create circular viewpagerap  pThese all seem to be based of a PagerAdapter. When I try to do a similar thing while extending FragmentPagerAdapter, as soon as I return a fakeCount of pages I get an exception when I Swipe through my Fragments, I only have 2 Fragments.  Exception java.lang.IllegalStateException Cant change tag of fragment. p  pI think this is caused as the FragmentManager thinks I am in position 2 but position 2 points to the fragment at position 0. Does anyone know how I can avoid this I am thinking I should experiment with extending Fragmentmanager. Any examples or help with this would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 63659 pIm not concerned about the case when multiple threads try to acquire a CS. What about a case where one threads locks and unlocks a CS Im particularly interested how it works in current multicore CPUs in x86 and ARMs.p  pBased on my simple guess, I think there is a lockcount and when a thread tries to acquire a CS it does interlocked exchangeadd. Does this exchangeadd affect other coresthreads in any way For example, cores have their own memory caches am I correct and interlocked exchangeadd would need to interact with all other cores to make sure that the piece of ram isnt cached somewhere else.p  pI assume, that its better to add a CS in place that isnt going to have multiple threads to access data, than to miss a CS in place that might rarely use multiple threads. But Id like to verify that if there is a thread that entersexists for a CS in a loop, then other coresthreads wouldnt stall because of intercpu synchronization going on behind the scenes.p  pthanksp

Negative 63659 pSo, Im trying to count the number of hours between a DateTime value and the current date with PHP. I dont want to do it by seconds and then divide it into minutes and then hours, because Id like for it to count each hour individually. For example, 4PM5PM would be 1, 5PM6PM would be 2, and so on. p  pSo if the DateTime was 20120924 74923 and the current DateTime was 20120924 80019 it would output the number 1. And if the DateTime was 20120924 74923 and the current DateTime was 20120924 85945 it would still output 1. It wouldnt change to 2 until 90000p  pThe DateTime Im using for comparison is coming out a database, and if I can figure out how I will make it so that it cuts off the minutesseconds portion of the DateTime so that theyre 0. If I could do the same with the current DateTime it would be easy. The thing is, I dont know how to do that. So how can I turn 20120924 74923 into 20120924 70000 It still needs to be in a DateTime format so I can put it back into the MySQL database in a DateTime fieldp  pThanksp  pEDIT I appreciate both answers I received, but I tried tinkering with them and couldnt get exactly what I wanted.

I then copied my library sources completely, and removed everything besides the header files for the includes folder.p  pI then created a new project to use my library.p  pI added this to my project filep  precodeINCLUDEPATH  CUsersStevieDesktopMyLibinclude LIBS  CUsersStevieDesktopMyLibMyLib.dll codepre  pThe headers have no problem, and it finds my DLL fine if I change it to a nonexisting path, it throw an error. It doesnt as of now.p  pNow when I go into my .cpp file, I include my header file, and try and use my library and it throws undefined reference to codeMyLibcode.... I have no idea why, as I am including the DLL and I believe it should be found perfectly fine.p  pAlso, I am 99 sure it isnt with Botan, as I use Botan often like this, and it works fine. Anyway, I include the Botan.dll with it anyway just to be sure, but its not throwing the undefined errors on Botan.p  pThanks.p

Negative 63659 pI have a codelttablegtcode where I want the vertical borders in the codelttheadgtcode  codeltthgtcode to be of a different color than the rest of the borders all borders are 1 pixel wide, no border on top of table. This may seem easy  problem is that in both Firefox, Safari and Chrome, these vertical borders bleed into the horizontal border below, which doesnt look very nice. In Firefox it looks OK if the row below the codelttheadgtcode contains the same amount of columnscells as the codelttheadgtcode, but if I use codeltcolspangtcode I get the bleed.p  pThe obvious solution would be to use for example solid on the vertical codeltthgtcode borders and double on the horizonal codelttdgtcode borders below  and this does indeed work in Safari and Chrome. However, Ive yet to come up with a solution for Firefox, and I think Ive tried everything. I cant remove border collapse as thats needed for other purposes.

Negative 63659 pI am trying to build an application that handles making lots of API requests to 2 or 3 related APIs.  My general strategy is to have one base class codeApiRequestcode that hasp  precodeListltParametergt Parameters Uri CombinedUri string Results string Host codepre  pand methodsp  precodeCombineUri combines the Host and parameters into full Uri MakeRequest makes the request and stores Results codepre  pThen I would inherit that base class into many different Api Calls and implement functions in those specific to that Api call.p  pThe problem I have is that I call codeCombineUricode in my base classes constructor, but it requires that codeHostcode already be set.  However, I want codeHostcode to be a constant in each child class since it is specific for each different Api call.  I do not want to have to remember to call codeCombineUricode from every derived class constructor.p  pAny ideas to get around that problem would be greatly appreciated.  Also, if you have a different design idea entirely for implementing a base for Api calls I would be all ears.  I am not sure my approach is the best.p  pThanks.p  pstrongMy Solutionstrongp  pI implemented ideas from both John and Colin Pear. I changed the base codeApiRequestcode into an abstract class, and I moved the codeCombineUricode method into the codeMakeRequestcode method.p  pI also went further and changed codeApiRequestcode into a generic class and changed codeHostcode into a codestatic stringcode.  This way, each subclass with subclass codeApiRequestltsubclassnamegtcode.  Due to the properties of generics, each object of a particular subclass will share a static codeHostcode.p
Negative 63659 pWe run many Tomcat servers and have observed full garbage collections GCs are often performed on an hourly basis, particularly when memory usage is relatively low. The precise time appears to be relative to the time the application server was started if a server is started at 0113, a full GC is done at 0213, and the next full GC will occur at 0313. I havent been able to find any documentation to explain this behavior.p  pThis is a problem because a server pool started simultaneously all tend to do full GCs at around the same time. If the GC delay is long enough to cause a loadbalancer to mark a server as down, the entire application can go offline for a time. It would be better if the full GCs could be distributed across a period so no two servers are doing a full GC at the same time, but I cant find any way to control this behavior.p  pHas anyone else seen this behavior Is there any way to influence when these regular full GCs happenp

Negative 63659 pI have an id that is pretty large on one of my java objects. When it jackson converts it to JSON it sends it down as a number e.g. id1000110040000000001 but as soon as it becomes a javascript object the id gets changed to 1000110040000000000. I read about this issue a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15869275jsonnotconvertinglongnumbersappropriatelyhereap  pIt works fine when the id is smaller. My first thought is to just force Jackson to convert all the numbers to strings but I am open to other options as well. If possible I would prefer not to add Jackson annotations to my java objects.p

Negative 63659 pIm working on a project that needs to have a page with controls being repeated for the number of elements to be introduced. For example, if I need to configure 5 elements, i will have 5 rows with different controls to configure each one of them.p  pThe controls are generated properly, they work independently, and all seems be working fine, but when I have multiple elements and the scroll bar appears, when I try to see the elements at the bottom the scroll automatically moves to top all the time.p  pI dont know if it can be avoied, or I could create this kind of control panels for the elements a different way, in some kind of control that right now I dont know if it exists or I just dont know how to use it for this function.

Negative 63659 pI have an app that was developed for my company. Unfortunately it needs to be resigned i know how do this part because the distribution cert has expired.

Negative 63659 pI have this problem where there are several parts in my code where I check if these certain conditions are met so that I can understand if what I am checking is of one type or the other. this ends up becoming large if else trees because I am making lots of checks, the same checks in each method, and there are several different types the thing I am checking can be. This I know can be solved using objects  Specifically, the things I am checking are 4 string values from a file. based on these string values, the 4 strings together can make one of 3 types. Rather than making these same checks every time I need to get the type the 4 strings make up, I am wondering if I can create a general object given these 4 strings and then determine if that object is an instanceof either specific class 1, 2, or 3. Then I would be able to cast that general object to the specific object.p  pSay I name the general object that the 4 strings create called Sign. I would take those 4 strings and create a new Sign objectp  precodeSign unkownType  new Signstring1, string2, string3, string4 codepre  pI need to check which specific type of sign this sign is.p  pEDIT for more detail, the Signs I am checking are not symbols like  or , they are signs with text like you would see on the road. there are 4 lines on each sign and they need to be checked to see if each line evaluates to match a specific type of sign. The first line of SignType1 will be different of the first line of SignType2, and I want to take those 4 lines Strings and pass it onto an object and use that object throughout my code to get the values from it rather than making the same checks in each method. If you want me to show some code, I can, but it wont make much sense.p

Negative 63659 pI just made a site in Dreamweaver that uses an image map. It works great on Windows, OS X, and Android, but it doesnt work on iOS. It displays an empty box with the missing image symbol in the middle. The links work, however, and if I tap blindly at nothing I can hit a link and be directed to where it goes. Why doesnt it work Image maps arent crazy new, and theyre perfectly within the bounds of what iOS can do since my Android phone has no problem at all displaying the page correctly. Is there something special I need to do I really want the feature to work in iPads, iPhones, etc. I must be missing something simple. Thanks in advance, any help is appreciated.p

Negative 63659 pI have been testing an IOS app on multiple platforms and have observed some weird behaviours while testing on the iPhone 4S.  The app crashes after performing a task that works on both the iPhone 5 and iPhone 3S.  When the crash happens there is nothing displayed on the debugger, absolutely no crash log or memory warnings appear in Xcode.  I isolated the block of code, and the specific line responsible for the crash.  I still dont understand why it is happening or how to find a solution.  The code is part of a larger method that downloads a number of images and displays them in UIImageViews.  Here is the codep  precodefill image tiles with images for int i  0 i lt [objects count] i      PFObject imageObject  [objects objectAtIndexi]     PFFile imageFile  PFFile [imageObject objectForKeyimage]     UIImageView imageHolder  UIImageView [self.view viewWithTag100  i]      imageHolder.image  [UIImage imageWithDataimageFile.getData]  codepre  pThe code loops through an object that has been loaded with image files from a server. The UIImageViews that each image is meant to be assigned to are tagged from 100  104, so they can be accessed with the loop index variable.  The line codeUIImageView imageHolder  UIImageView [self.view viewWithTag100  i]code extracts the UIImageViews from the main view.  In the next line the imageHolder view is assigned an image, this is the line that causes the crash, and when commented out the view loads without fail.  I havent been able to determine why this is happening or if it is the imageFile or imageHolder view that is not being set up properly.  Perhaps someone here can shed some light on the problem.p

Negative 63659 pI am getting confusing and seemingly inconsistent results with one ActiveX DLL trying to create an instance of another.p  pEverything worked until we rebuilt our entire codebase, something which had never done since taking it over a few years ago.  We previously just built pieces as we needed them.p  pThe problem is occurring in multiple places, but here is a representative examplep  precodeDim objMid As MiddlePiece.clsMyClass Set objMid  CreateObjectMiddlePiece.clsMyClass codepre  pThis is hitting an error 48 Error in loading DLL on the codeCreateObjectcode line.  I tried changing around the code and came up with the following results.p  precodeDim objMid As MiddlePiece.clsMyClass Set objMid  New MiddlePiece.clsMyClass codepre  pThat gives me error 48 again.p  precodeDim objMid As Object Set objMid  New MiddlePiece.clsMyClass codepre  pThat also gives error 48.p  precodeDim objMid As Object Set objMid  CreateObjectMiddlePiece.clsMyClass codepre  pThat one actually works.p  pCan anyone explain what the real difference is between these, and why only the last one works now, whereas at least the first one was working beforep  pI think I understand the difference between early and late binding, and that only the last example is an instance of late binding, but Ive checked and confirmed that on both the build PC and the test machine, the registry contains the same version of MiddlePiece.dll, so Im not clear on why this would fail.p  pThe problem seems to stem from the fact that MiddlePiece.dll was built with Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects.  There have been numerous issues related to this ever since we moved from Windows XP to Windows 7.  The msado26.tlb library no longer worked for us, so we had to change our references to that library to refer to msado60Backcompat.tlb instead.  That seemed to work for a while, but weve since had more trouble with two different versions of msado15.dll.  The newest version is breaking code in both VB6 and C.p

Negative 63659 pMy app opens the camera using surface holder. Camera opens with a default preview size. On certain devices the default preview size captures more image than is actually visible on the screen. Inorder to avoid this, I started setting the preview size myself. Criterion is to select the preview size from the available list of sizes, which is closest to the width of the screen. p  pThis works well most of the time. But often I stumble upon few devices which doesnt like the preview size I selected. p  p1 Nexus 4 didnt capture the image for one of the preview sizes I selected. 2 Samsung S 4 gives band of linesnoise along the  captured images.p  pSo I wanted to understand if I am doing anything against the standard.

So my end goal is to obtain a table like thisp  precodeproj degree closenesscentrality typecentrality    W      2                 0.75               1    X      3                    1               1    Y      2                 0.75               1    Z      1                 0.60               1 codepre  pFor reference, the closeness centrality of a node codeucode is defined as CuN1sum over all nodes codevcode of the distance from codeucode to codevcode, where N is the number of nodes in the graph and the distance from codeucode to codevcode is the length of the shortest codeucodecodevcodepath. The type centrality is CT,codeucodeTcodeucodesum over all nodes codevcode in T of the distance from codeucode to codevcode where T is the set of all nodes of a given type, and Tcodeucode is the size of T with codeucode excluded so either T or T1 depending on the type of codeucode.p  pOne of the big challenges is that my actual codedfcode has almost 300,000 rows and this graph will have around 155,000 vertices. The average degree will be very low though so I think that it is doable.p  pMy questions arep  ol liIs R the best tool to be using for this Are there good packages for performing these types of calculations on graphsli liWhat is the best way to store this kind of data Should I form an adjacency matrix, or something elseli ol  pAny insight or tips at all would be well appreciated as an economics major Im kind of in over my head compsciwise here.p  pThanksp

Negative 63659 pSeeing that all other related topics have 0 or 1 answers, Im not very confident about this, but lets give it a go... First Im not asking in the devexpress forums because the paying user is somebody else, and getting their permission to post is a mess.p  pI have the following setup in a lot of the websites views a filtering box lets call it Our Filter, and a GridView beneath it. The filtering box sends the form to the grids callback function, which filters the viewmodel and rerenders the grid. In quite a few, we have the Filter Builder option to create filters.p  pOur problem is that the filters created work well, but ignore Our Filter. We would like the filters created to take Our Filter into account, basically only filter over the visible rows.p  pA concrete example we have a grid we can filter over Bank bank is not a column of the grid, this calls the grids callback which filters the viewmodel and refreshes the grid partialview, if in this grid we have 2 rows with a column X which both have value Y. If I create a filter with the Filter Builder, with column X equal to Z, it works, but it gets them from the complete list, not the filtered one these two rows for example, dont show.p  pIs there a way to resolve this Any ideas are welcome.p  p EDIT  Our index controller returns a viewmodel with the complete list of entity User, and shows a gridview with the User list and a few properties, for example the name and Add Date. It also shows a form above the grid to filter the users by addDate, you can put a range and submit. This submit calls the gridviews callback function, which is another function in the controller that creates a viewmodel with a filtered list of users using LINQ, only getting those elements from the DB, and returns a partialview of the Grid, only rerendering the grid. Once its rerendered, I want to use the devexpress filter builder in the bottom of the grid. When I put a rule into it, and accept, it works embutem it shows ALL the users that comply with it, not the ones in the list shown in the grid the ones filtered by date. I hope this clarifies the two types of filters.p

Negative 63659 pI would like to ask, if it is possible to get my database from an offline not functioning xampp p  pYou see, I have backed up my database earlier but I am not sure whether there are all the data I need now and the DB is pretty big like 50 tables. I wanted to go for a local implementation of apache, mysql and PHP for my web applications. So I have reinstalled mysql and want to use my own local apache server instead of xampp.p  pI would like to know where can I find some .sql or something that is stored in xampp that could be otherwise accessible via the phpmyadmin Is it even possible I have scrolled through the xampp folder and tried to figure out where it can be, but didnt find anything though.p  pThanks for help.p  pEDIT p  pI am on a mac running mavericks.p
Negative 63659 pHello PythoniPython users.p  pI have found a weird behavior of python using numpy arrays. I found a solution to the problem myself, but Id love to get an explanation.

Im  quite familiar with Matlab,R and Fortran and never ran into a problem like this before. Why would someone want to have a second name for the same data instead of a copy of this vector Just some pythonspecific syntax thing or is there more to understandp

Negative 63659 pI am creating a series of small sites, Im using the django framework. The theory goes a user comes to a master site, signs up, then he gets his own child site.p  pExamplep  pnavigate to example.com user creates an account mysite user then gets his own site mysite.example.com and he can configure this all he wants My question  would it be better to have a gold version of the site that gets created for each sitep  pfor instance cp goldsite mysite and change the database pointers appropriately  the downside is if I ever have to do maintenance on a file, I would have to change all subsites.p  p...or  have one host and configure the database to support multiple sites.

Negative 63659 pstrongScopestrong I am developing a mobile application using Xamarin C to target both Android and iPhone initially Android. The application logic is separated out in to a PCL C where possible to ensure maximum code reuse. The application integrates with the YouTube Data API v3 for the purpose of rating retrieved videos and allowing subscription to a channel. p  pstrongBackgroundstrong As per the documentation a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comgoogleplayservicesauth.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comgoogleplayservicesauth.htmla I have used the suggested approach to generate an OAuth2 token for the authorised requests from Android, using the AccountManager.getToken method and this works fine and returns a token.p  pThe next step is to make requests using this token lets take rating a video as an example. My initial idea was to utilise the .NET client library for the YouTube Data Api a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comapiclientlibrarydotnetgetstarted relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comapiclientlibrarydotnetgetstarteda. However, it seems that this would take us through the whole authorisation process once again and would likely require a web view redirect or similar. I had hoped that there may be a way to use a token which had already been retrieved to create the credential object or create the service from directly, but it doesnt appear to be the case.p  pThe second problem I have found with the client library is that not all of the classes appear to be referenced when adding the NuGet package, namely the GoogleWebAuthorizationBroker. Additionally, as we are in a PCL we are limited with common objects such as FileStream which is utilised in the documented examples a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comapiclientlibrarydotnetguideaaaoauth relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comapiclientlibrarydotnetguideaaaoautha. I did try to use this library from a nonPCL project also to confirm that it wasnt just the limited references in the PCL which were responsible for the GoogleWebAuthorizationBroker reference issue.p  pThe other option therefore was to look at manual construction of the URL and then posting the data to make the HTTP request ourselves. This too has met with limited success similar to the question listed here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18856551likevideowithaccesstokenonyoutubeusingyoutubedataapiv3Like video with access token on YouTube using YouTube Data API v3a, which doesnt appear to be answered suggestion to use the client api. Is this method supported, and if so are there some documented .NET examples This method would allow me so get the token natively on android, iphone and then pass it to a PCL library where I could make the requests, which would be preferable.p  pstrongQuestionstrong So my question is given the scope of what I am trying to achieve here what would be the approvedsuggested approach. Clearly the more I can do within the PCL the better from a code reuse point of view, but right now Id be fairly satisfied with an approach that will actually just work for Android. If anyone has any examples of successfully making authenticated requests to the YouTube Data Api v3 from Android that would also be useful. I feel like Ive trawled through a lot of the documentation to this point over a number of days but not found anything definitive to say this is how you should do it.p  pThanks in advance for any help.p

Negative 63659 pIt is great that Haskell allows us to walk around in the category Hask. But sometimes I feel it is too tight. So I had this idea about a programming language that would allow us to move around in the category Cat of small categories, where categories would be types and functors from categories C to D would be  functions of type CD. At first it seemed a crazy idea, but I found an a hrefhttpwww.brics.dkRS0127 relnofollowarticlea by Glynn Winskel and his student Mario Jose Cccamo about such calculus However it is limited to a fragment of Cat. Do you think that it would be possible to extend Haskell in this spirit, i.e., instead of working in the category Hask, it would work in the category or better, 2category Cat Are you aware of any calculus similar to the one by Cccamo and Winskelp  pa hrefhttpwww.brics.dkRS0127 relnofollowhttpwww.brics.dkRS0127ap

Negative 63659 pI am working on a project that manage production of large number of documents in batches. The workflowp  ol liThe user creates a new Batch using the application, based on a template that defines its requirements requirements are usually files that user will have to upload and the system will process.li liOnce all requirements are met, the system will process all inputs and generate a large number of documents thousandsli liThose documents need to be post processed JustInTimeli liSome batch operations have to be done, for example, publishing all documents, in which case, all those documents will need to be postprocessed first.li liThere are constraints on what operations can run simultaneously, each document can be post processed at most once, etc.li ol  pI have currently modeled the Batch itself as an aggregate root, but dont store the list of produced documents in the Batch object itself, but rather retrieve those documents from my data store using a collection id that was persisted in the batch object. The only reason I chose to do this was because I didnt want to make my aggregate root contain a large collection and become bloated, but this is getting in the way of developing the business logic, because now I have to deal with consistency issues across documents in the batch.p  pMy question is, in DDDCQRS, when using a document database for persistence andor when using event sourcing, how should one deal with aggregates that contain large collectionsp  pI have seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3958107domaindrivendesignaggregaterootswithlargecollectionsthis posta and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2210262dealingwithnestedaggregatesindddthis posta, neither addresses my concern, one uses nhibernate collection filters that is neither and option for me, nor do I think is the right way to deal with this issue since it leaks storage logic into the domain model, the other is more about accessing objects in nested aggregates and doesnt address storageretrieval issues.p  pFYI, using .net, c, service bus, using an oversimplified generic repository backed by SQL, planning to switch to MongoDb in very near future.p

Negative 63659 pWe have 4 different data sets and want to perform faceted search on them. We are currently using SolrCloud and flattened these data sets before indexing them to Solr. Even though we have relational data, our primary goal is faceted search and solr seemed like the right option. p  pRough structure of our data Dataset1col1, col2, col3,col4 Dataset2col1,col6,col7,col8 Dataset3col6,col9,col10p  pFlattened datasetcol1,col2,col3,col4,col6,col7,col8,col9,col10p  pIn the end we flattened them to have one common structure and have nulls where values do not exist. So far Solr works great.p  pProblem Now we have additional data sets coming in and each of them have about 5060 columns. Technically, I can still flatten these too but dont think it is a good idea. I know that I can have different collections with different schemas for each data set but we perform group bys on these documents so we need one schema.p  pIs there any way to maintain documents with a subset of fields of the schema under one collection without flattening them If not, is there a better solution for this problem p  pFor instance DocAfield1, field2 DocBfield3,field4. Schemafield1, field2, field3, field4. Can we have DocA and DocB under one collection with the above schemap  pOur backend is on top of Cloudera HadoopCDH4.6 and 5.2 distribution and we can choose any tool that belongs to the Hadoop ecosystem for a possible solution. Thanks in advance.p
Negative 63659 pWe are a team that is developing an application in which the users must register to be part of the application, and be allowed to use it. It is a paid application. We have a standard form for normal registration, but we want to give the user a simpler choice, and simply log in with a social platform. This is done in many other applications Spotify for example. The problem we are facing is that when a user has registered with Facebook, we get the email address and name back, and that is all we need except a password At first, we had an idea just to set a parameter to something like facebookVerified  true, and then save the user like that in the database. And when the user logs in via Facebook at a later time, our database knows that it was registered as a Facebookaccount, and we allow the user in without any password.  The problem with this approach is obviously that anyone could decompile our application, edit some code so that the facebooklogin is bypassed, and they would only need the mail address of the user in order to log in to our application. Another approach would be to fetch the email and name from when the user log in, and put it in our manual register form, and force the user to choose a password. But in that case, we might as well just skip the choice to log in with Facebook, since we are forcing the user to create a normal account.p  pSo, has anyone got any ideas or tips on how others solve this issue  Thank you  Joakimp

Negative 63659 pIm creating an iOS app that triggers a server call whenever you come into bluetooth proximity of another iPhone running the app. Each iOS device should have some unique bluetooth advertisement identifier e.g majorminor combo so the appropriate serverDB call can be made.p  pMy first plan was to use the standard iBeacon API CoreBluetooth  CoreLocation. Worked like a charm but hit a standstill when I realized that you cant advertise bluetooth while your app in background using this method.p  precodeMethod 1  Create the NSUUID Object NSUUID uuid  [[NSUUID alloc] initWithUUIDString6CA7D72E824E45D199E902BD33599A81]  Initialize the Beacon Region self.myBeaconRegion  [[CLBeaconRegion alloc] initWithProximityUUIDuuid major1 minor1 identifiercom.emjoseph.test]  Get the beacon data to advertise self.myBeaconData  [self.myBeaconRegion peripheralDataWithMeasuredPowernil]  Start the peripheral manager self.peripheralManager  [[CBPeripheralManager alloc] initWithDelegateself queuenil optionsnil]  voidperipheralManagerDidUpdateStateCBPeripheralManager peripheral     ifperipheral.state  CBPeripheralManagerStatePoweredOn     Bluetooth is on  start broadcasting     [self.peripheralManager startAdvertisingself.myBeaconData]           codepre  pp  pMy second attempt was using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comInstrumentVicinity relnofollowInstrumentVicinitya API set up by a hrefhttpsgithub.combentford relnofollowBentforda on Github that replicates the iBeacon API solely using CoreBluetooth. This solved the issue of being able to advertise in the background. The problem though was that I couldnt figure out how to send the equivalent of a major or minor in the bluetooth advertisement data and this is limiting because the receiving phone needs to some unique identifier of the device it received data from so it can make the appropriate serverDB call. It seems I just have access to a UUID and name property in the advertisement data.p  precodeMethod 2  NSDictionary advertisingData  CBAdvertisementDataLocalNameKeyemjoseph,                                   CBAdvertisementDataServiceUUIDsKey[CBUUID],                                       Start advertising over BLE [peripheralManager startAdvertisingadvertisingData] codepre  pAny hunches on how I can I achieve the desired setup I thought about using method 2s CBAdvertisementDataLocalNameKey property string as a unique ID, but it has its limits.p  pAlso Id like all users of the app to be on the same UUID to filter out unwanted signals.p  hr  pTo reiterate once more, the basic flow of the app is When person A gets close to person Bs phone, person A receives some unique ID from person B via bluetooth e.g majorminor combo and person A uses that unique ID to retrieve the relevant information from the DBserver. The only stipulation is that Id like for this process to happen when the app is running in the background as well.p

Negative 63659 pI am using GLSL shaders in a small Java OpenGL project I am making, and I am trying to come up with a wellwritten objectoriented way of organising my code. So far, I have a class called codeModelcode, which can contain multiple meshes, each of which has its own texture and material a material being a set of parameters to describe ambient, diffuse, specular, blending, etc.. In order to achieve this, I understand that I could pass uniform variables to the shader every time I need to change material. However, the drawing takes place in the models codedrawcode method. Does that mean that each instance of the codeModelcode class needs to have a particular shader associated with itp  pAlso, I have a codeCameracode class, which produces a matrix that will transform vertices simulate the cameras pitch, yaw, and position. This matrix then needs to uploaded to the shader as the view matrix. Doesnt that mean that I need to upload this matrix to every shader that I use So if each codeModelcode can have its own shader, how can I upload the cameras view matrix to all of them And even so, isnt it inefficient for every single model to have its own shader If you wanted to draw a certain model lots of times, then you would be codeusecodeing the shader and uploading a matrix to the shader every time you drew it.p  pIm really struggling to come up with an objectoriented solution that links multiple shaders, multiple objects and multiple materials. Any help is appreciated.p

Negative 63659 pSo I have extracted info from a JSON, but I have come across something I have never seen before. Here are three examples.

Negative 63659 pI am working on an app idea and I am curious if a procedure I am thinking of will work.p  pWhen a user opens my app he she should login with his Facebook credentials and confirms to some permissions. Then a second user should login with his her credentials and confirms to the same permissions.p  pAfter the two confirmations I would want to save both credentials and access tokens for future use of the app. So every time the app starts, both users get verified with their Facebook accounts and the app gets activated and can be used.p  pIf I understand the Facebook iOS API correctly, it is not possible to login two accounts at once. So how do Ip  ol liStart app li liLogin user 1li liSave name and gender for user 1 in a dictionary do I need to save username and password li liLogout user 1li liLogin user 2li liSave name and gender for user 2 in a dictionary do I need to save username and passwordli liLogout user 2li liActivate appli ol  pAbove procedure should run every time an app starts.p  pI looked at the example app with the iOS SDK SwitchUser but I just do not understand where the access tokens are saved and how they can be accessed used to accomplish above described procedure.p  pAll the help would be appreciated Thanksp

Negative 63659 pI am planning to roll out the APK to a closed set of users basically friends and family to let them play around with the app and suggest improvementschanges etc. p  pOnce done with debugging, I would like to list the app on Play Store, so that these closed set of users who already have the app installed can just update it. Is that possible p  pThere are few userspecific data that I am storing and I do not want these users to lose that data That would be disastrous Would simply keeping the package name as same allow these users to update the app p  pI am worried that since Play Store does not know about these users, they may see the Install button on play store listing instead of Update button. p  pAny help is appreciated. p
Negative 63659 pIm trying to figure out if it would be possible to implement an ICAP server that handles respmod responses coming from the ICAP clientproxy passively. That means, I should only get a copy of the web traffic and store it for later analysis. That obviously means I should not be inline, the proxy should not wait for any response so no latency is added what so ever. I know I can just copy the message and then respond immediately without altering the message but Im trying to figure out if thats possible being completely transparently passive .p

Negative 63659 pI have been using Anaconda Python a lot but also have made many package upgrades like PANDAS.

But then I remembered that Id have to do all the necessary upgrading.p  pMy last effort in possibly making this easy is this question is there a way to rebundle the upgraded anaconda or one its environments so that it can be stored on S3 and used as in the EMR bootstrap actionp  pThanks for any helpp  pADDED  I suppose it would require a license to be able to wrap up an Anaconda distro like this and use it on various machines, be they in my office network or on AWS.

What is the proper way, if any, to encapsulatebundle this virtual environment so that I can efficiently deploy it as needed  I have come across pip bundle and there is conda clone and conda create as well.  Also, there appears the concept of conda channels.  Its just not clear to me if I can put these together for efficient deployment on EMR and if so, how.p

Negative 63659 pAs far as I know if we have multiple PHP worker threads of single pool php5fpm running on multicore machine VPSVDSworkstation those threads will be distributed evenly between cores. This is default behavior of php5fpm and doesnt require any setting in configuration files, which is distinct from nginxs codeworkerprocesscode. php5fpms pool is a process and worker of that pool is a thread.p  pCan multiple threads be on same CPU tick in single moment If no, can microtime return same value in differet worker threads due to precision loss since it works not with jiffies tick numbers, but instead uses some OS function to convert jiffies to microsecondsp

Negative 63659 pIm currently working with Git, Git Flow, Gulp and Bower. Im working on the codedevelopcode branch and create releases with Git Flow to the codemastercode branch. So codedevelopcode is equal to my local and test environment, codereleaseversioncode to the acceptance environment and the codemastercode branch is equal to the production environment. See a hrefhttpnvie.comfilesGitbranchingmodel.pdf relnofollowhttpnvie.comfilesGitbranchingmodel.pdfa. On every environment runs Git, so deploying is nothing more than codegit pull origin mastercode.p  pIve got some dependencies like Bootstrap and Font Awesome handled with Bower and Im using Gulp to watch code.lesscode files for compiling to css, minifying cssjs, etc.p  pNow toward to the questions what should be in my Git repository Lets say Im working on a Magento project, it would be overkill to put Magento and all dependencies from Bower in the repository. Currently Im excluding only the codenodemodulescode for Gulp and codebowercomponentscode contains dependencies directories, when I run Gulp the code.lesscode files from Bootstrap will be merged and compiled with my project related code.lesscode files. The compiled code.csscode file is currently included in my repository, else its not possible to do a deploy with just codegit pullcode. To get it working without having the compiled version in Git Ive to run Gulp on the production server.p  ol lipWhat is the best method for not having my platform Magento or Wordpress in my Git repository, but keep the possibility to easily update I came across this solution a hrefhttpblog.gdesign.netpost60019471157managinganddeployingwordpresswithgit relnofollowhttpblog.gdesign.netpost60019471157managinganddeployingwordpresswithgita where theyre using Git Submodules. Nice solution, but this way the platform needs to be in a sub directory. Not ideal because Ive to hack to get it working that way copy the codeindex.phpcode and change the include paths, etc.pli lipWhat about pluginsmodules 3th party plugins shouldnt be in my repository too Only the plugins Ive created by myself. But not all 3th party plugins does have a Git repository to use with for example Git Submodules. For Wordpress its just one directory, so in theory its possible but for Magento the most plugins arent just one directory they have files in the codeappcodecode, codeappdesigncode, codeskincode, etc directories. Ive a lot of Wordpress and Magento sites with multiple matching pluginsmodules now every pluginmodule is in each sites repository.pli lipShould compiled files be in a repository If you ask me no, but Im currently doing it so its easy deploying. Is it general to have Bower and run Gulp on a production server for dependencies and to compile on the production server right after a codegit pullcode Continues running a Gulp watcher like I do locally on production takes some extra unnecessary resourcespli ol  pI hope someone can put me in the right direction.p

Negative 63659 pIve been running a site for the past 3 years with out any issues.  The current SSL certificate was applied the past December.  It is running on the FreeBSD 10 operating system.

Nothing seems to stand out in my logs either.  I will try to post the configuration below in hopes someone with a fresh set of eyes sees something Im overlooking.

Negative 63659 pI have two activities, A and B.p  pA is a FragmentActivity. At some point it will start Activity B like sop  precodeIntent myIntent  new Intentthis, B.class startActivitymyIntent codepre  pB is a normal activity, but in the codeonCreate..code I start the fragment that goes with this activity like sop  precodegetSupportFragmentManager.beginTransaction.addresource, fragment.commit codepre  pIf at this point I navigate away from the application say by pushing the home button I can simply click on the launcher icon and I get the running fragment with activity B back, so far so good.p  pNow this fragment is running a timer that at some point creates a notification. I would like to push that notification and go back to the running instance of that fragment with activity B rather than via the launcher icon.p  pI tried to do this following the Android documentation using a TaskStackbuilder a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsuinotifiersnotifications.html relnofollowlinka. Instead of restoring the running activity, the VM is actually destroying activity A which in turn destroys B along with its fragment and then creates a new A if I use class A in the Intent or creates a new A and then a new B if I use class B in the intent.p  pI know there are several similar questions on SO but none of the answers I found addresses the issue I have.p

Negative 63659 pI am working on a Minecraft like game and trying to get block deletion to work properly. I have a function that returns the proper coordinates of the block and then calls DestroyBlock below which casts 6 rays in each direction of the face of a cube and is supposed to destroy any quad it encounters.

My problem is that this DestroyBlock function doesnt always work. As you can see in the images on the first click, everything works properly and the correct faces are destroyed and then rendered, but when I do the second click, it only destroys one face of the new block... img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPxR0R.png altBefore Any Clicksp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBrMf6.png altAfter clicking on the corner blockp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgeCz2.png altResults of clicking on the now exposed dirt block facep  precodevoid DestroyBlocksint x, int y, int z        Vector3 origin  new Vector3x, y, z      Ray Up  new Rayorigin  Vector3.up, Vector3.down     Ray Down  new Rayorigin  Vector3.down, Vector3.up     Ray North  new Rayorigin  Vector3.forward, Vector3.back     Ray East  new Rayorigin Vector3.right, Vector3.left     Ray South  new Rayorigin  Vector3.back, Vector3.forward     Ray West  new Rayorigin  Vector3.left, Vector3.right      RaycastHit markedQuad      ifPhysics.RaycastUp, out markedQuad, 1f          DestroymarkedQuad.transform.gameObject         Debug.LogDestroyed Up           ifPhysics.RaycastDown, out markedQuad, 1f          DestroymarkedQuad.transform.gameObject         Debug.LogDestroyed Down           ifPhysics.RaycastNorth, out markedQuad, 1f          DestroymarkedQuad.transform.gameObject         Debug.LogDestroyed North           ifPhysics.RaycastEast, out markedQuad, 1f          DestroymarkedQuad.transform.gameObject         Debug.LogDestroyed East           ifPhysics.RaycastSouth, out markedQuad, 1f          DestroymarkedQuad.transform.gameObject         Debug.LogDestroyed South           ifPhysics.RaycastWest, out markedQuad, 1f          DestroymarkedQuad.transform.gameObject         Debug.LogDestroyed West         codepre  pAnd I know that the raycast is hitting the quads because of the debug messages but for some reason it is not actually destroying all the sides when it hits them.

Negative 63659 pHow can I setup a shared source code library projectp  pTo be clear, I have an Eclipse project source code that is a library.  It is used in multiple applications.  I need to import it into Android Studio.  I need to be able to see its source code in the same Android Studio window as the applications source. All without moving the librarys source files into the applications directory.p  pThis post is NOT a duplicate of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16588064howdoiaddalibraryprojecttotheandroidstudioHow do I add a library project to the Android Studioa .  That post discusses adding a jar library not a source code library. The solutions are similar, but not the same.  Mine is more succinct, and hopefully with correct grammar making it easier to read.p

Negative 63659 pIm developing an Android app that captures Bluetooth LE signals and Im a big fan of test driven and behaviour driven development. So, I want to develop my app by using TDD and BDD. When it comes to TDD it is no problem to test the bluetooth part with a hrefhttprobolectric.org relnofollowRobolectrica. But, when I want to write my behaviour driven tests, I can not test bluetooth because the android emulator does not support bluetooth in any way see a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtoolsdevicesemulator.htmllimitations relnofollowherea. p  pSo, I thought it must be possible to simulate a Bluetooth LE device in software which forwards simulated Bluetooth broadcast packages to an Android X86 running in a virtual machine. p  pDo you have any pointers to implement that Im thinking about a small user space program which receives simulated Bluetooth signals from my BDD framework over TCP and then forwards those signals to the simulated device. Then the device forwards them to the Android X86 VM and the Android app catches and processes the signals. p  pa hrefhttpwww.spinics.netlistslinuxbluetoothmsg03127.html relnofollowThis posta seemed promising but did not work.
