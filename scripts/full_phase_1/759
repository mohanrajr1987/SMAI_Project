Positive 759 pI am in the process of setting up a headless Ubuntu server to experiment with a hrefhttpscrosswalkproject.org relnofollowCrosswalka.  My first attempt was on a virtual server with 15Gb of disk space.  It came a cropper because I ran out of disk space during the codeandroid update sdk nouicode step.

Much to my surprise it consumed all of the 20Gb and gave up.p  pClearly, this is not a viable route forward.  I could in principle get a VM with, say, a 100Gb disk but I would end up paying for something I dont need.  I observed what was happening during the install more carefully during my second attempt.

Positive 759 pI have been developing automated tests to my app, however, we reached a point where we have to change options outside the app environment. To do so we decided to use the latest UIAutomator v2. By doing so we are able to use espresso testing inside our app and UI Automator for system popups or change settings in the same test.  The issue at this point is that we have to maintain min SDK 16 for contract purposes. This makes it impossible to use UIAutomator v2. The compiler itself suggests a solution p  precodeSuggestion use toolsoverrideLibraryandroid.support.test.uiautomator.v18 to force usage codepre  pMy current gradle relevant gradle configp  precode compileSdkVersion rootProject.ext.compileSdkVersion  buildToolsVersion rootProject.ext.buildToolsVersion    default apk name to be overriden  project.archivesBaseName  AwessomeApp   android.enforceUniquePackageNamefalse   defaultConfig          String charPrefix  AWS         minSdkVersion rootProject.ext.minSdkVersion         targetSdkVersion rootProject.ext.targetSdkVersion         versionCode appVersion.getCode         versionName appVersion.getName         applicationId pt.company.awesome         testApplicationId pt.company.test         testInstrumentationRunner android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner      codepre  pHowever, it doesnt work, probably because we have the minSdk set by the root project using gradle.

Negative 759 pWeve always been an Intel shop.  All the developers use Intel machines, recommended platform for end users is Intel, and if end users want to run on AMD its their lookout.  Maybe the test department had an AMD machine somewhere to check we didnt ship anything completely broken, but that was about it.p  pUp until a few of years ago we just used the MSVC compiler and since it doesnt really offer a lot of processor tuning options beyond SSE level, noone worried too much about whether the code might favour one x86 vendor over another.  However, more recently weve been using the Intel compiler a lot.  Our stuff definitely gets some significant performance benefits from it on our Intel hardware, and its vectorization capabilities mean less need to go to asmintrinsics.  However people are starting to get a bit nervous about whether the Intel compiler may actually not be doing such a good job for AMD hardware.  Certainly if you step into the Intel CRT or IPP libraries you see a lot of cpuid queries to apparently set up jump tables to optimised functions.  It seems unlikely Intel go to much trouble to do anything good for AMDs chips though.p  pCan anyone with any experience in this area comment on whether its a big deal or not in practice   Weve yet to actually do any performance testing on AMD ourselves.p  pstrongUpdate 20100104strong Well the need to support AMD never became concrete enough for me to do any testing myself.

Negative 759 pWhen debugging a VB6 application, I have noticed that the VB6 IDE keeps any libraries loaded if they were used by the application being debugged.

Negative 759 pI am creating a tool with which to edit web pages within a CMS. The main goal of the tool is total flexibility for the user.

To date, I have 238 such properties, mostly integers and short strings. I have now to create a mysql table for the data. I have some years of web development experience, and it was an absolute taboo to even consider putting 238 columns into a mySQL table. But on second thought, Im starting to think, why not p  pIt is the most convenient thing for me right now, as my CMS I am integrating this new tool in has a collection of readymade input elements that are connected with single database columns. Any other way of storing the properties e.g. grouping them so a border property is stored in one field would require huge changes to the collection, which I would very much like to avoid  I am in a big project and literally working day and night.  p  pI would create and alter the table based on a XML definition, so I could live with administering a 238 column table.  Storage efficiency is not important  the expected number of pages will not exceed 50100.  I need to make no queries on the table except for loading a single page at a time using the primary key.p  pSo, mySQL experts, is there anything emseriouslyem speaking against storing this kind of data in 238 columns Would you expect problems, exponential memory usage, anything like that p  pUsually, I would translate the various properties into full CSS strings, and build classes that can parse and deal with such strings  that would reduce the number greatly.

Negative 759 pI understand that neither a abstract class nor an interface can contain a method that is both a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions370962whycantstaticmethodsbeabstractinjavaabstract and statica because of ambiguity problems, but is there a workaroundp  pI want to have either an abstract class or an interface that mandates the inclusion of a static method in all of the classes that extendimplement this classinterface. Is there a way to do this in Java If not, this may be my final straw with Java...p  pEDIT 1 The context of this problem is that I have a bunch of classes, call them Stick, Ball, and Toy for now, that have a bunch of entries in a database. I want to create a superclassinterface called Fetchable that requires a static method codegetFetchablescode in each of the classes below it. The reason the methods in Stick, Ball, and Toy have to be static is because they will be talking to a database to retrieve all of the entries in the database for each class.p  pEDIT 2 To those who say you cannot do this in any language, that is not true. You can certainly do this in Ruby where class methods are inherited. This is not a case of someone not getting OO, this is a case of missing functionality in the Java language. You can try to argue that you should never need to inherit static class methods, but that is utterly wrong and I will ignore any answers that make such points.p

Every other byte is fine.  A did some traffic capturing with WireShark and saw that the byte was 0 leaving the server, which I find even more baffling.  The third byte is set via a define, alap  precodedefine GETTOPFRAME   0xfe codepre  pSome testing I did that further confuses the issuep  ol liI changed the value from using the define to first code0x64code, code0xffcode, code0xfdcode all came across to the client.li liI changed the value from using the define to using code0xfecode itself the value was zero at the client.li liI changed the value of the define itself from code0xfecode to code0xefcode the value was zero at the client.li ol  pNothing about this makes a lick of sense.  The code goes through several levels of functions, but here is most of the core codep  precodeint nbytes  network order bytes  static int sendsize  7 unsigned char tbuffer[7] tbuffer[0] protocolByte tbuffer[1] op tbuffer[2] GETTOPFRAME nbytes  htonlbytes memcpytbuffer3, ampnbytes, JAVAINT  sendfd, tbuffer, sendsize, 0 codepre  pWhere codefdcode is a previously put together socket, codeprotocolBytecode, codeopcode, and codebytescode are previously set. It then sends the rest of the message with a very similar send command immediately after this one.  As I mentioned, if I put a break point on that send function, the tbuffer contains exactly what I expect.p  pAnybody have any ideas here  Im completely stumped nothing about this makes sense to me.  Thanks.p
Negative 759 pI have an a hrefhttpcodeblog.theg2.net201002parallelforeachfileprocessingin.html relnofollowIronPython scripta that uses the TPL and Parallel.ForEach to process files using multiple threads.

Negative 759 pI have a system where some loosely coupled components are communicating by exchanging messages over JMS. I am now looking at a new requirement which leads to some shared resource needing protection from access by two or more components at the same time more or less an instance of the readerwrite problem. I am looking for a way to coordinate access to the shared resource without adding too much additional complexity to the system. E.g. I wouldnt want to add a dedicated distributed lock manager to the mix if I dont have to.p  pI have a partial solution in my head which would use the JMS infrastructure as its base. Basically, sending lockmessages to queues. If there is a message in the writers queue, no one may post to that queue until the component that sent the message removes it again. Similarly, when a reader start reading the resource, they would send a message to the readers queue and remove it one they are done. A writer wouldnt start to write until it sees both the readers and the writers queue empty. A reader wouldnt start until it sees an empty writers queue.p  pOf course, I would need to find a way to synchronize the access to both queues so that a writer doesnt post to the writer queue while a reader posts to the reader queue that already saw the empty writer queue...p  pCan such a thing be pulled of with a reasonable amount of work Are there maybe existing implementations of a lock manager on top of JMS Any papers on the topic you would recommendp

Negative 759 pIm trying to figure out how to create a sandbox area in my new Windows .NETSQL Server application. Heres the requirementsp  pUsers must be able to enter their own data for things like date ranges and pricing Users must be able to run multiple scenarios against this pricing and date range datap  pThe data structures above will also be used in the regular production database. So on the one hand well have all the structural information built, on the other every user from 10 to 30 people currently needs to be able to create their own testing scenarios. p  pWhat Im not sure about is the best way to do this. I supposed I could give everyone local copies of SQL Express and make sure the local copies reflect the data structure of the production data, but this seems messy and less than ideal. I dont want to create many copies of the database on the production server to give everyone their own playground either.p  pIs there something obvious Im missing here The requirement that the users be able to enter their own configuration data for prices, date ranges, etc., is the thing Im really stuck on. They need to run these what if scenarios against their own settings, but the production system cant have this kind of stuff in there. p  pTemp tables may be out because these scenarios may need to be saved across sessions, like when they leave one day and come back the next or whatever.p  pAny pointers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 759 pI want to implement a base web application using ASP.NET MVC2 that will automatically scan the deployed assemblies for implementations of a certain interface  lets call it IWebModule. So it should be possible for third party vendors to implement the interface to integrate their module into the application. Of course there have to be two assemblies at the minimum  one for the base web application and one for the module.p  pTo make things a bit more clear imagine that the base application has a preferences view that displays all available IWebModule implementations in a tree and by clicking on one of the nodes a module specific preferences view will be shown.p  pThe thirdparty preference view, controller, and model should be implemented in the CustomeModuleSolution, not in the BaseApplicationSolution. This approach should also be useable for other things like application menus, toolbars etc.  The application functionality can be enhanced by just implementing provided interfaces of the base application  so this is like using extension points to add functionality to the application by implementing interfaces which register addins and event handlers for further use. p  pThe focus of this question is the how to implement the model, views and controller in different solutions or split an web application into module solutions and how to get it run together.p  precodeCustomModuleSolution Controllers Models Views  Preferences   CustomModulePreferenceView.aspx   BaseApplicationSolution Controllers Models Views  Preferences   Preferences.aspx codepre  pIf there is a way to do this, please let me know.

Both projects have a special part where I convert a codedoublecode to an codeStringcode.p  pI both projects I did this by calling codeString.valueOfvarcode.p  pIn the older project I get the number always in a format like 0.00097656 which is the format I need. In the newer one I get an tenth exponential format like 9.765625E4. I also have the fact that the old project cuts the string to be small enough.p  pMy question is Which commands can cause to this behavior that java changes the default conversion output. I already searched the code but I dont see something which does this. Or is it maybe an eclipse optionp  pI want to get the newer project consistent to the older one and I dont want to use these string format calls every time in the new project. Anywhere in the old project there must be a setting or some calls...p  pHope somebody can give a hint.p
Negative 759 pIve been developing a JavaScript library similar to Underscore.js and Jquery in the past few days. In both of those libraries they use an object which can accept parameters but can also have methods called on it param.method or param.methodp  pIve been reading through the source code on both of these libraries trying to understand how they are implementing such a thing but have been unable to figure it out. I do not know the name of this type of closure so Ive been unable to search for it. p  pAny help would be appreciated, Im just trying to figure out how I can implement an object of this type into my library.p

Negative 759 pI have this school project and it is about using setjmp and longjmp to do imprecise calculations. The program starts a timer that will signal a signal handler.p  pBefore the timer expires, there is some iterative calculationfor demo purposes, just a loop doing nothing useful. At the beginning of this loop there is a setjmp call, and in the signal handler there is a longjmp call. This basically forces the loop to stop mid calculation and run the signal handler where it calls longjmp. p  pThe problem I am having is that whenever the calculation portion is very short, I seem to segfault fairly consistently, however when the calculation portion is longinner loop has many iterations, it runs just finehave not run into a segfault yet. Obviously the segfault must be occuring in the areas surrounding that calculation section, but I cannot figure out where it is coming from as debugging changes things as does using print statements.p  pHere is the code I havep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltsignal.hgt include ltsystime.hgt include ltsetjmp.hgt include lterrno.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt  jmpbuf env   static void usrtimertickint signal      ifsignal  SIGALRM              longjmpenv, 1         Program Description   This program first sets up the timer to signal usrtimertick   every 1 second on the SIGALRM signal. It then proceeds to do an iterated calculation three times.   An infinite loop calls setjmp and when 0 is returned, continues doing   a calculation on temp. After an iteration is complete, the result of   the iteration is saved into finalResult after blocking SIGALRM to   make the saving of the result atomic.     Once the signal handlerusrtimertick is triggered, it calls longjmp which forces   setjmp to return a nonzero value, which causes the main function to break out   of the infinite loop and start a new calculation...this is done a total of 3   times for demonstration purposes.   int mainint argc, char argv       init timer using setitimer..real mode     int which  ITIMERREAL     struct itimerval value     struct sigaction sact     sigsett newmask, oldmask     sigemptyset ampnewmask      sigemptyset ampoldmask      sigaddsetampnewmask, SIGALRM      sact.saflags  0     sact.sahandler  usrtimertick     sigaction SIGALRM, ampsact, NULL      value.itinterval.tvsec  0         One second      value.itinterval.tvusec  0     value.itvalue.tvsec  1            One second      value.itvalue.tvusec  0      setitimerwhich, ampvalue, NULL        double finalResult  0     int loopcount  0     double tempResult  0     forint j  0 j lt 10 j              loopcount  0               stdcout ltlt Run  ltlt j ltlt  begin loop              ltlt loopcount ltlt n               ifsetjmpenv  0                timer not hit yet                  sigprocmaskSIGBLOCK, ampnewmask, NULL                 value.itinterval.tvsec  0         One second                  value.itinterval.tvusec  0                 value.itvalue.tvsec  1            One second                  value.itvalue.tvusec  0                  setitimerwhich, ampvalue, NULL                  sigprocmaskSIGSETMASK, ampoldmask, NULL                 for                                      Do some random calculations                     forint i  0 i lt 1 i                                              tempResult  tempResult  .001                                           block signal from arriving and save to finalResult                     ifsigprocmaskSIGBLOCK, ampnewmask, NULL lt 0 exit1                     finalResult  tempResult                     stdcout ltlt Run  ltlt j ltlt  complete loop                          ltlt loopcount ltlt  result   ltlt finalResultltlt n                     loopcount                     ifsigprocmaskSIGSETMASK, ampoldmask, NULLlt 0 exiterrno                                           else                              timer signal arrived, print the final result and get out of loop                 stdcout ltlt Run  ltlt j ltlt  killed on loop                          ltlt loopcount ltlt  result  ltlt finalResult ltlt n                 sigprocmaskSIGSETMASK, ampoldmask, NULL                 break                          return 0  codepre  pI understand some of you may not agree that longjmp should be used in a signal handler, but this is the way my professor said to do it.

Negative 759 pI am facing a problem in animation.p  pSo right now in my app, I have a subview which has a close button. When the close button is pressed, a curl down animation occurs showing the previous view. That is working properly. I perform the curl down closing animation by passing a notification to the NSNotificationCenter like this code[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationNamenotificationName objectself]codep  pNow I wanted to apply an animation to the close button itself so that when I press the close button, it would perform an animation as well as the curl down animation would occur. So the way I do it is by the following code p  precode[UIView transitionWithViewself.view.superview duration1                        optionsUIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseIn                     animations                          closeButton.frame  CGRectMake500, 15, 100, 40                      completionnil] codepre  pWhere previously the closeButton.frame had the value of 580,15,100,40 so the animation would be like the image was moving from right to left from 580 to 500.p  pSo what happens when I run the code is that when I press the close button, the close button animation does not happen but the curl down animation occurs. So for testing when I commented out the code where I post the notification, the close button animation works perfectly but the curl down animation does not happen nor does the previous view come up  since I do not send a notification which would cause the view to close. p  pI would like to know what is going wrong here and why it does not allow 2 animations to occur at the same time.p

Negative 759 pIm currently developing an app for iOSdevices. This app downloads data from a wordpress blog, but fetches a noncetoken first.

In addition to this, the data has to be downloaded as well, which takes another 45 seconds.p  pIn the datafetchingmethod there are several securitymeasures taken, for example a secret string that needs to match on both the webserver and device of course encrypted, and some sort of simple UDIDvalidation  some header and useragenttests.

Negative 759 pWe recently purchased a codesigning certificate and Ive been incorporating the code signing step into our automated builds.p  pOur build script has to build both VB6 and .NET projects, so we currently have a batch file that builds everything. For the .NET projects, our build script calls MSBUILD, passing in a solution file to build. The projects in these solutions have some thirdparty dependencies, and these files all have the strongCopy Localstrong option turned on in emReferencesem, since they are needed to run the application. In addition, some projects use COM Interop, and so they have automaticallygenerated Interop assemblies such as strongInterop.MSXML2.dllstrong that are also copied to the to the output folder during a build.p  pIm trying to figure out an easy to only code sign the files that are compiled during the build i.e. emourem assemblies, and ignore thirdparty libraries and Interop assemblies, without resorting to having to call strongsigntool.exestrong on each assembly separately.p  pCurrently, I worked around this by doing the following in the build scriptp  ul liMake sure the build cleans all previouslybuilt filesli liCompile the .NET solution with MSBUILD, specifying an output folder for the buildli liRecursively sign all of the binaries EXEs, DLLs, OCXs in the output folder with strongsigntool.exestrong. This signs everything, including the thirdparty libraries and autogenerated Interop assembliesli liMy thirdparty dependencies are in a separate codelibcode folder, so I copy all of the files from codelibcode back into the build output folder, overwriting the copies that the build copied there. This way these files are no longer signed, but our assemblies still areli ul  pMy question is, is there a better way to do this The only other alternative I can think of is to call strongsigntool.exestrong individually on each assembly that needs signing, but this could be a pain because of the number of projects and the amount of change occurring in them assemblies get renamed, move, get deleted as the projects evolve. Plus, I dont want to have to guess whether a particular assembly got signed or not, so looping through the files and signing them in bulk makes the most sense to me.p  pAt the same time, however, it doesnt seem right morally, legally, or otherwise to arbitrarily sign files that we didnt create with our codesigning certificate.p  pOr maybe Im going about this the wrong way altogetherp

Negative 759 pI am in the midst of trying to find an ecommerce solution for my employer, and it is necessary that we go with a hosted payment page to minimize our PCI compliance woes. After researching several companies solutions, it seems that they all expect you to submit the total price of the transaction to them via a hidden field or GET variables in order to generate the payment form. This seems like a sizable concern for the merchant, since a user with Firebug or eyes, in the case of GET variables could easily modify the transaction total, get a new hosted payment form, and continue with the checkout, thus giving themselves whatever discount they desire.p  pHas anyone set up a hosted payment page before and dealt with this issue Any suggestions for a better way to do thingsp

Negative 759 pI am trying to make a file upload interface in ASP.NET webforms and am looking for some advice on how to proceed.p  pThe file upload interface is part of a website I am making on which users can post adverts. The interface is part of the create a new advert and will enable the user to upload up to 6 images. I am using only the asp.net FileUpload server control as I am trying to make a control which will work when users have javascript disabled. Thats the background.p  pThe upload for all 6 files occurs on button click. This stores the files in a temp folder UserUploadstemp until the user submits the form in which case the files are moved to the UserUploads folder and the references in the database or until the user hits the cancel button or navigates away in which case the files are deleted.p  pFirst question is Is storing the files in a temp directory the right way to go about this Or is there some better way of keeping the temp files on the server until the parent form is submitted The only alternative I can think about is saving the files to the session, but that seems like a recipe for killing the server...p  pSecond question I am unclear what to do when the user just closes the browser window. I want to avoid ending up with a mess of orphaned files in the temp directory. Is there some way to make sure that all the files will get cleared out if the user doesnt go through with the form submission Or do I just have to perform a cleanup of the temp directory every so oftenp  pThird question Am I doing this completely wrong and there is in fact a much better approach to uploading multiple filesp

Negative 759 pIm having a problem using WCF Data Services for an entity that has a composite primary key. Im using the Silverlight 4 Business Application Template and have created an Entity Data Model EDM against the database for the relevant tables and created a WCF Data Service for this EDM in the web project.

I also load the main data into another codeCollectionViewSourcecode via a third codeDataServiceCollectioncode.

This all works fine so far.p  pI then add a strongSave Changesstrong button with a codeClickcode handler that calls codeBeginSaveChangescode. If I change the value of the codeExtraDatacode field, and then click strongSave Changesstrong the changes are saved without any problems. However, if I change the value of one of the navigation properties I get an exception when codeBeginSaveChangescode is calledp  blockquoteError processing request stream.

The god thing with this is that it will never be a problem to know what value the user have choosen.pli lipIf we instead take the list of choises on the server and order it by a given property, after this we generate a valueid starting from 0 and up. This will make the HTML look bether and we will never have to think about to much changes in the meta data that results in high values. The problem is when mapping it to the object on the server side, we will have to order the list againmaby cached to avoid this and then check the match. Another problem here would be if the meta data is changed so even if the user have selected index 3 that is object with id 2304 he will instead get object with the id 2302.pli ul  pI have looked at a couple of pages but when it is about filters like miles and years it seemse like thay count indexes starting from 0 my second choise p

I put some time into studying the code before I basically just copypasted it without thinking about it much.

This effectively changes the basedir of the routed FO into that of the applications executable. I have yet to figure out how to do this without a transformation and route my input directly into FOP, but for the moment I worked around this by copying my images into the executables directory.p  pWhich is where another problem came in. Now whenever I try to execute the code, I get an exception at the line that says codetransformer.transformsrc, rescode, which confuses the pants out of me, because it doesnt say anything. The ExceptionHelper saysp  blockquote   pjava.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError was caughtp blockquote  pand there is no inner exception or exception message. I know this is hard to debug just from what I wrote, but Im hoping there might be an easy fix.p  pAlso, a hrefhttpmailarchives.apache.orgmodmboxxmlgraphicsfopusers200702.mbox3C44885EEC04286740BE281A823A1DE94B92C81Cbigvaro.varo.local3E relnofollowthisa email seems vaguely related but there is no answer to it.p  h2UPDATE2h2  pFinally, after a few sleepless nights, I managed to get it working with one of the simplest ways possible.p  pI updated IKVM, compiled fop with the new version and replaced the IKVM references with the new dlls.

Negative 759 pI have a question how to deal with a saga where the decision making depends on an event that was published before the saga was created.p  pHere is an example to illustrate my issuep  pImagine I have a CustomerAR and a OrderAR. When the customerAR is created a validation process starts, the result of that process is the amount of an order that the customer is free to spend without special authorization. I will not go into detail about this process because its out of context. When the amount is calculated a command is sent to the the CustomerAR with the calculated amount and the CustomerAR publishes an event CustomerMaxOrderAmountEvent with that value. So far so good.p  pThen a few weeks later the customer places an order. The OrderAR is created and starts my OrderSaga. The saga waits until the order is created completely and then has to make a decision if it needs to send an AutorizationCommand for that order. To make that decision it has to know if the CustomerMaxOrderAmountEvent is published and the value of the amount. Normally the OrderSaga will also subscribe to the CustomerMaxOrderAmountEvent, but the problem is this event will never occur because it already did in the past.p  pHow should I deal with this. Should I query the read model to know the value, should I send a command to get the value, should I make a reference to the CustomerAR, should I replay all historic events in the saga so he knows the history already.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pPlease note that its about the concept not about this concrete example. The example is pure for clarification of the problem 2 non related aggregate roots that are not part of the same bounded context.p  pThankful for help.p  pMelvin p

Negative 759 pWe have a Facebook event with an associated web site. On the web site we would like to be able to show interesting information about the attendees. I am find this remarkably hard to do. There does not seem to be a simple means of returning the number of attendees, nor does it seem practical to get, say, the most recent 25 users who say they are coming. All that I have discovered so far is the Graph API for listing attendees is broken it wont return more than 999, the since parameter appears to be ignored for the attending function and trying to get just the most recent 25 would mean wading through potentially thousands of entries if the API did return the correct number  assuming that the most recent are at the end.p  pAm I completely mistaken I would like to be or is this API just not suitable for this seemingly mundane task Ideally I am looking to do this with PHP but other working solutions would be considered.p

Negative 759 pThis is mostly a philosophy question, as the actual problem is solved.  The SDK provides a Gallery class.  This Gallery is 90 of what I need, its just missing 2 things.  One I want to implement an extra Runnable that triggers periodic advances to the next item, and two I need it to animate the scroll between items.p  pThe auto periodic advance was easy.  However I came across major issues implementing the scoll animation between items.  Now Ive solved this by override setSelection to essential be a wrapper to onFling.p  pMy background is primarily Python at this point, so this implementation feels kinda dirty to me.  Im calculating a velocity based on the parents width and then calling onFlingnull, null, mycalculatedvelocity, 0.  This feels really wrong to me, what if for some reason the way google calculates distance from velocity changesp  pNow I look through the source of Gallery, and I see tons of ways that feel a ton better to me moveNext scrollToChild mFlingRunnable.startUsingDistancep  pNone of which are accessible from a subclass of Gallery.  In Python there is no real concept of private, so I find it frustrating to no end that when I subclass something in java I end up having to copy paste 23s of the class just to override a single behavior.p  pSo the question is am I doing something wrong thats leading me to attempt to do things in ways that are against the Java grain or can I just expect to be frustrated everytime I sit down to work on an android project and find all the methods that do what I need to be be private or default, rather than public or protectedp

Negative 759 pSo I have an application already built and Im in charge of making it a Universal App. I am using XCode 4.1 and made the app Universal.  It did all the great plist and creation of a new mainwindow stuff.  When I run it on the devicesim I get an ipad view with a smaller window size like I expected.  Each of the apps views are very graphical and uses images set to the correct size.  I also have different size art for the different possible screens.p  pMy understanding is that if I recreate an iPad version of each of the views ie. MainMenuViewController uses the MainMenuViewController.xib, I can just create a MainMenuViewControlleriPad.xib and then tell it to load that instead of the main view.p  pHow do I go about telling it to use the other view AND does this work for the iPhone 4 Retina display as well Do I need a MainMenuViewControllerRetina.xib as wellp  pThanks for any and all helpp

Negative 759 pI have experimented with various approaches to this and would like to see what you guys thought was the best approach to solving this problem in Python.p  pBasically, I have a web service that accepts requests provided a single query term and proceeds to perform a series of computations, in parallel, with that term. These computations can be thought of as individual function calls.p  pThe idea being that as soon as the request comes in, I call the functions asynchronously, and hold the request until results start to trickle in. p  pFrom my research, it seems like using a library like a hrefhttpwww.gevent.org relnofollowgeventa is probably the best way to go, although I am still not entirely familiar with greenlets. Also, it seems like in order to accomplish the type of functionality I am looking for for results to be sent back to the client via the long request as they become available, I need to use a special type of StreamServer that supports this. The response itself is just JSON objects to be read in by a JavaScript module in the frontend, which in turn will update a UI component as these are sent back to the browser.p  pWhat is the best approach to doing this Does it make sense to use something like gevent or should this instead be implemented using coroutines without the assistance of a library I am sure that this is something that has been done a lot in the past by many people around here and I wanted to gather some recommendations.p  pThanks a ton in advance, let me know if youd like more details, and I look forward to hearing  about your suggestionsp

Negative 759 pIm new to both WCF and threading, so please bear with me.  I have a WCF service set up.  The service has multiple threads, all of which act upon a single array.  This works without a problem so far.  However, this service has a method, which, when called, will return the array.  My questionsp  ol lipThe array is serialized when it is transferred to the client by WCF.  Is this a thread safe operation  In other words, can I count on WCF to block all threads from accessing this array while its being serialized  pli lipIf I cant count on WCF to do this, then how can I implement it manually  I dont really understand how WCF would facilitate this since the serialization happens after I return from my method call.  How can I guarantee a thread will not modify the array after its been returned by my method but before WCF serializes itpli ol

Negative 759 pOk. So I know how to create a trigger that makes changes to Table B when an action is made on Table A. that is reletively easy and I am comfortable doing so. What I have been unable to do is to create a trigger that contains an if statement so that it executes if certain criteria are met. p  pExamplep  pTable A amp Table B are related. Table A contains data concerning documents that are currently in processing which are identified by a unique processing code. Table B contains data about finalized and released documents which are identified by a Publication ID. Table A and Table B are related because a document may undergo many revisions and therefore it may appear multiple times in Table A unique processing code but same Publication ID while still only appearing in Table B once. The Publication ID remains the same throughout the course of the documents life no matter how many revisions it undergoes. p  pTable A is filled via an input form where people submit requests concerning documents they would like to have us process. They have the option of selecting to process a new document or if they would like to revise a current document that is already in Table B. This is done via a radio group New, Revision etc.... If Revision is selected then a select list box, that is populated with Publication IDs from Table B, appears and the user can select which document to edit.p  pWhat I need to do is create a trigger, or some other means, that will, when a request is submitted via our input form, check to see if it is for a revision of a document in Table B and mark the Status column in Table B to Revision in Progress.p  pSo it would need to be either conditionally called or have some kind of if statement in the trigger itself. The condition, again, would be if Revision is selected on Table As input form then set the Status of the selected Publication ID to Revision in Progress.p  pThanks p

All the setup messages are transmitted across the SPI bus correctly.  Without the inner for loop, this code block takes around 10 seconds.

Negative 759 pCould anyone give an example of why it would be advantageous to use MVC instead of a simpler Model and a View only.p  pNote whether its called MVC or MVP ModelViewPresenter, Im talking about the one where the View receives input, then the Controller will respond to the input event by interpreting the input into some action to be done by the Model.

Negative 759 pIve started work on my first Azure application, and Im learning a lot as I go. One of the features I discovered recently was Federations in SQL Azure, essentially the SQL Azure sharding implementation so we can scale horizontally.p  pMy project started using SQL Server, and was already largely grouped by user Profile, so I decided that makes the most sense to federate on. Ive created the federation, including all of the child tables with one snag  Identity is not supported. I get why its not supported, what Im not sure on is what best to replace it with. This seems like a huge problem that someone else must have solved, but I havent been able to find much.p  pI could just use UniqueIdentifier, but I read that can be a pain to split on. Im also not too sure of what other performance issues I could run into using a GUID as my Primary Key for federated tables.p  pIm using this with Entity Framework, but havent got to the point of making that federation friendly yet. From what I can tell, its not much more complicated than executing some code to select your federation before writing your LINQ query, but Ill cross that bridge when I get to it.p  pFor the moment, I have no idea how best to actually emaddem items to my federation, because there is no good solution to generating an identity. p  pAny advice would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 759 pstrongFor those who want to create their own git repository on a remote OSX Snow Leopard client box, then sync with it over SSH from XCode 4.1  read on.strong p  pIve managed to get this to work, but I think it might be helpful to others who are now pulling their hair out in the same boat I was in, to read over the steps I took, and for anybody with more experience than myself to point out where I could do things better  and perhaps include any helpful screen shots etc .p  pIve just successfully created a working remote git repository on a spare Snow Leopard MacMini, and tested syncing it with XCode 4.1, with a local git repo  the default local repo for XCode  unfortunately, it turns out theres a LOT that you have to get right in order for this to work embut it does workem p  pstrongPreliminarystrong To avoid confusion for those new to git,  as far as Im aware  GIT is GIT ... that means, there really isnt a special server version and a client version ... for the most part, the GIT that was installed locally on your machine when you installed XCode, is pretty much the same that runs on a server. The only significant difference is the support software  infrastructure that runs on top. p  pIts this optional separate layer that a server could use to allow users to connect to the underlying git system, that makes most of the difference between a git server  aka remote  and a git client.  Do folks connect using a web interface running in Apache  Are they running using another kind of user interface mediator  ie Gitolite , or are they simply connecting to git directly over SSH, using actual OSX user accounts on the remote server Thats an important one to get your head around if youre new to git and trying to set up your own remote server emdirect or mediated access.em  p  pThis note assumes youre only working with a small number of known users, and therefore have no need of an extra mediating layer, and therefore, well opt for direct access over SSH using actual OSX accounts. Please also note  this is NOT about syncing to GitHub, theres plenty of notes available on that topic elsewhere.p  pBut before we go any further, emare you sure you just want to use OSX Client accouts rather than a separate user mediating layerem  like Gitolite  Gitosis etc  ... keep in mind, that for direct access, every user wholl need to gain access to the server in the future, emwill require you create an actual OSX client account in System Prefsem ... if this isnt much of a hassle, great, otherwise check out Gitolite as it avoids this problem in the long run  but adds an extra layer of setup in the short term  a hrefhttpsgithub.comsitaramcgitolitehttpsgithub.comsitaramcgitolitea .p  pstrongSECTION 1strong  Setting up your OSX Client GIT server.p  pIm assuming you DONT have XCode installed on your OSX git remote box, so youll have to download and install GIT, fortunately, this parts easy ...p  pFrom the actual remote box, surf to a hrefhttpgitscm.comhttpgitscm.coma and get git, open the disk image, then run the installer.p  pDont forget to also run the setup git path for nonterminal programs.sh shell script  that comes with the installer  its probably right next to the installer on the disk image  ... sadly its not the allround magic link fixer if youre doing what we are, but it does take care of some headaches for the account that did the install.p  pstrongCREATE USER ACCOUNTSstrong Since were NOT using an access mediating layer, youll create user accounts directly in System Preferences on the remote OSX box for all the users who will be using this service.p  pCreate an OSX user Group that will have access to the repositorys, and add these users to that group.p  pIn the remote boxs System Preferences  Sharing , enable Remote Login  this emisem SSH , you also have the option of only allowing specific users access ...  more on this service later  as it has to change too p  pTest the remote login from your local machine, using a personal account you setup earlierp  pssh yournameremoteGitBox.comp  pIf you get in, or if youre prompted to create an rsa key, this means youve connected, great  but only create keys for accounts you plan to personally use.p  pIf the machine is behind a firewall, port 22 may NOT be open for good reason youll have to somehow get access to the machine over either this port, or one you select below ... if youre not in control of your firewall, this might be pain  regardless, more on this port stuff below.p  pOn the remote machine, create a shared master repository directory in UsersShared,  something like UsersSharedgit ... probably best not to get too creative with the naming.p  pFor now, create a sub folder in that directory, call it UsersSharedgitTest1 or whatever name you like. p  pIn the terminal on the remote machine, go to that directory you just made  UsersSharedgitTest1  and create the first remote GIT repository, you do this by tying git bare init at the prompt, emfrom inside that directoryem, this creates all the necessary repo files. There are notes on the meaning of this prompt ... but for now, we just want to get you connected amp running, though obviously you should take the time to learn about these prompts at some point. p  pIn the Finder GUI on the remote box  its generally easier in the GUI on OSX as the perms can get whacky compared to standard UNIX  select the  UsersSharedgit folder, get info on it, and grant read  write access to that directory and all sub dirs, to the respository access group you created earlier in OSX system preferences. A quick way to apply the changes recursively to all subfolders, is to unlock the info panel, and click on the little gear symbol at the bottom  select Apply Changes to Enclosed Items ... p  pstrongBIG SECURITY ALERTstrong As hinted above, unless you want every bot on the internet trying to brute force its way into your repository, you MUST change the remote servers SSH port from 22 to just about anything else ... honest, theres bots all over the net that do nothing but sniff for open port 22s. Changing the port  is hardly the bees knees for security  BUT  it will save a LOT of firewall log thrashing, since otherwise, every bot will almost instantly find you and begin brute force attacks.p  pstrongChanging SSH port on the remote OSX git boxstrongp  pOn your firewall open a pinhole to some TCP number youre comfy with  for a list of available TCP ports, go here, and pick something strongnotstrong on the list a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiListofTCPandUDPportnumbershttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiListofTCPandUDPportnumbersap  pTo change the SSH port, youll have to open  SystemLibraryLaunchDeamonsssh.plist but first, MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF THIS FILE Then open this up in your favorite text editor.  this requires admin permission to edit  youll have to add a listener to the list ... heres what I did, and after much pain and suffering, it workedp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNiQr1.png alt SystemLibraryLaunchDeamonsssh.plist changes p  pUnfortunately, restaring SSH on OSX client with key commands is a science project, so youll have to go back to system prefs  sharing, and turn off and then turn on remote login, or simply restart the box  dont worry, if you did it right, youll have the standard SSH port open to anybody behind the firewall, and a new port you can ssh in on, which the firewall will point anybody external to.p  pTo test the new port, type this on your local machine ssh p 65534 youremoteGitBox.com as Im sure youve guessed, 65534 is the stand in for whatever port number you chose.p  pOnce again, create any necessary ssh keys if youre prompted to do so  but only for your account If you cant log in with SSH over the new port, did you remember to restart the service or the machine You MUST get this working before anything else will workp  pNext, youll have to deal with getting all the necessary path Alias right on the remote box  if you dont, youll get the mysterious gituploadpack missing message when you try to push onto the remote repository in XCode.p  pIn the terminal, as an admin on the remote box, change directories to usrbinp  pThen in the terminal, type the following command   sudo ln s usrlocalgitbingit .    yes thats a period, include it , that path will work if you used the default git installer, if not, youll have to type   sudo ln s  [pathtogit] bingit .   this will require admin access.  youll be prompted for a password p  pstrongSo  heres what youve done so farstrongp  ul liInstalled gitli liSet up a repositoryli liSet up the necessary paths to that repository, including some custom linksli liCreated user accounts li liCreated a group for those accounts, and granted that group file level read  write permission to the repositoryli liCreated a new port to SSH in onli liAltered your firewall to point to this port  unless youre crazy, never open port 22 to the internet li ul  pstrongOK, now onto XCode on the local machinestrongp  pId recommend creating a new test project ... it doesnt really matter much what you call it, TestProject1 ... but as you step through the template to make it, be certain to create its own local git repository  this is an option during the creation template, in the dialogue box .

Negative 759 pI have a problem that hopefully has a simple solution. I am trying to create a bobbing effect using a button, a timer, frame, cgaffinetransformrotations, and delays. Everything would be great, except that when the button is rotated and I set the frame of the button to decrease or increase the y by 10 or so pixels, the rotation makes the frame of the button bigger than it normally is. The end result is a button that constantly grows until it swallows the screen.p  pI tried making the upward and downward movements cgaffinetranslations, but that uses the transform property which is the same one that the rotations use. The result is a very jumpy and nonrealistic bob. p  pWhat I am trying to accomplish is just to set the origin component of the frame without having to specify a width and height, because even specifying a hardcoded width and height still makes it shrink when it is rotating and grow when it is approaching equilibrium again.p  pAny ideasp  pThanksp  pCODEp  precode voidmovePlay [self performSelectorselectormoveDown withObjectplay] [self performSelectorselectorrotateRight withObjectplay afterDelay0] [self performSelectorselectormoveUp withObjectplay afterDelay0.5] [self performSelectorselectorrotateLeft withObjectplay afterDelay1]     voidmoveUpUIButtonlog  [UIView beginAnimationsnil contextnil] [UIView setAnimationDuration.5] log.transform  CGAffineTransformMakeTranslation0, 20 [UIView commitAnimations]     voidrotateRightUIButtonlog  [UIView beginAnimationsnil contextnil] [UIView setAnimationDuration1] log.transform  CGAffineTransformMakeRotation0.017453292510 [UIView commitAnimations]   codepre

Negative 759 pClient has a financial services website where he gets CSV spreadsheets full of leads every morning. Usually they are about 10k  15k records in each sheet.

Negative 759 pIm trying to represent boolean expressions in sum of products formSOP in Python with only lists. p  pFor example, I have boolean expressionp  precodeABCDEFGIH codepre  pI need to find a list equivalent of the expression above, so by reading the list or nested list and following certain rules to read the list, the programprogrammer reading the list will be able to convert it back to the boolean expression. p  pOne way I thought of doing this is constructing nested lists. Two rules to follow p  ol lielements in the same list are ANDed togetherli lilists are parallel to each other, therfore ORed together. li ol  pSo for the example above, it will translate top  precode[[A,B,C],[D,E,[[F,G],[I,H]]]] codepre  pBut this set of rules conflicts itself in some cases. For example, given [[E,F],[D,C]], it can either mean EFDC or EFDC, as [E,F] and [D,C] are in the same list so they should be anded, but lists are parallel so they should be ORed too. p  pI feel like I need to set some precedence between the 2 rules above, or add another rule to make it more clear. p  pAny thoughts or suggestions are welcome. Also its not homework, just something for fun. Thanks in advancep

Negative 759 pI am trying to work with data from very large netCDF files 400 Gb each. Each file has a few variables, all much larger than the system memory e.g. 180 Gb vs 32 Gb RAM. I am trying to use numpy and netCDF4python do some operations on these variables by copying a slice at a time and operating on that slice. Unfortunately, it is taking a really long time just to read each slice, which is killing the performance. p  pFor example, one of the variables is an array of shape code500, 500, 450, 300code. I want to operate on the slice code[,,0]code, so I do the followingp  precodeimport netCDF4 as nc  f  nc.Datasetmyfile.ncdf,r myvar  f.variables[myvar] myslice  myvar[,,0] codepre  pBut the last step takes a really long time 5 min on my system. If for example I saved a variable of shape code500, 500, 300code on the netcdf file, then a read operation of the same size will take only a few seconds. p  pIs there any way I can speed this up An obvious path would be to transpose the array so that the indices that I am selecting would come up first. But in such a large file this would not be possible to do in memory, and it seems even slower to attempt it given that a simple operation already takes a long time. What I would like is a quick way to read a slice of a netcdf file, in the fashion of the Fortrans interface getvara function. Or some way of efficiently transposing the array.p

Negative 759 pI am having trouble installing a program, using a WiXbuilt installer on a vanilla Windows XP install. WiX 3.0.5419 is being used to author the installer. I cannot update to a newer WiX toolset at this point.p  pI run the WiX authored installer and it needs to install several prerequisites from the internet. It downloads them and places them in a temporary folder located at CDocuments and SettingsLocal SettingsTempVSD2.tmp yes, that is a folder. It then extracts the real application install file to CDocuments and SettingsLocal SettingsTemp7zS1.tmp yet again, the .tmp is a folder. p  pA vanilla XP image comes with Windows Installer 3.01. The software I am installing needs Windows Installer 4.5 to install correctly. The installer for 4.5 is installed and requires me to reboot. I go ahead and reboot. When the machine comes back up, it continues installing the rest of the prerequisites. After they are done, it says Unable to locate application file setup.msi. setup.msi is the name of my installer. When I review the log file, I just see the same error.p  pSo, I go hunting and what do you know The 7zS1.tmp folder is gone the VSD2.tmp folder is still there, but not the 7zS1.tmp. I tried the install again on a vanilla XP image, and confirmed the folder gets deleted after the Windows Installer 4.5 install reboot. p  pMy questions is, how should I go about fixing this Can I make a change to my WiX files, perhaps by controlling where the temporary installation files are stored so theyre persisted across a rebootp

Negative 759 pIm using WLS 10.3.4.0 as my JMS provider. My application has producers and consumers configured using Lingo and Spring Remoting. My Producer is codeorg.logicblaze.lingo.jms.JmsProxyFactoryBeancode , while my Consumer is codeorg.logicblaze.lingo.jms.JmsServiceExporterMessageListenercode. I have enabled autoreconnection for producers and consumers on WLS. Strangely, all my consumers reconnect automatically, but my producers dont seem to.p  pI tried configuring an codejavax.jms.ExceptionListenercode, with the codeonExceptioncode method resetting the connection. However, once the WLS JMS is available again and the producer doesnt reconnect, the exception listener is never triggered. But I do see multiple codeLostServerExceptioncodes when I try to send a message using the producer. This makes me to believe that WLS did not notify the connection factory at all in the first place, about the reconnection. I have tried using plain old codejavax.jms.ConnectionFactorycode with no codeExceptionListenercode and codeorg.springframework.jms.connection.CachingConnectionFactorycode with codeExceptionListenercode.p  pHere is the relevant codep  pcodeCachingConnectionFactorycode configurationp  precodeltbean idcachedTestQueueConnectionFactory classorg.springframework.jms.connection.CachingConnectionFactorygt     ltproperty nametargetConnectionFactory refwlsQueueConnectionFactory gt         ltproperty namesessionCacheSize value1gt     ltproperty namereconnectOnException valuetrue gt     ltproperty nameexceptionListener refexceptionListener gt ltbeangt  ltbean idexceptionListener classcom.test.ExceptionListenerTestgt     ltproperty namecachingConnectionFactory refcachedTestQueueConnectionFactorygt ltbeangt  ltbean namemyProducerConfig classorg.logicblaze.lingo.jms.JmsProducerConfig lazyinittruegt   ltproperty namedeliveryMode value2gt ltbeangt codepre  pCommon JNDI lookups used across multiple web applications inside my tomcat containerp  precodeltbean idbaseWlsJndiObjectFactory   classcom.test.common.jndi.BasicJndiObjectFactoryBean   abstracttruegt     ltproperty nameinitialContextFactory valueweblogic.jndi.WLInitialContextFactory gt     ltproperty nameproviderURL valuet3localhost8001 gt  ltbeangt  ltbean idwlsQueueConnectionFactory parentbaseWlsJndiObjectFactory lazyinittruegt    ltproperty nameexpectedType valuejavax.jms.ConnectionFactory gt    ltproperty namejndiName valueMyQueueConnectionFactory gt ltbeangt  ltbean iddefaultJMSDestination parentbaseTibcoJndiObjectFactory   abstracttruegt   ltproperty nameexpectedType valuejavax.jms.Destination gt ltbeangt  ltbean idlingoMetadataStrategy     classorg.logicblaze.lingo.SimpleMetadataStrategy     lazyinittruegt   ltproperty nameoneWayForVoidMethods valuetrue gt ltbeangt  ltbean iddefaultJMSTaskExecutorPool classorg.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskExecutorgt     ltproperty namecorePoolSize value25gt     ltproperty namekeepAliveSeconds value5gt     ltproperty namequeueCapacity value20gt     ltproperty namedaemon valuetruegt ltbeangt  ltbean idbaseMsgListenerContainer classorg.springframework.jms.listener.DefaultMessageListenerContainer abstracttruegt     ltproperty nameconcurrentConsumers value1gt     ltproperty namemaxConcurrentConsumers value1gt     ltproperty nametaskExecutor refdefaultJMSTaskExecutorPoolgt     ltproperty nameconnectionFactory refwlsQueueConnectionFactorygt ltbeangt codepre  pMy Producer and Consumer configsp  precodeltbean idmyJMSDestination classcom.test.common.jndi.BasicJndiObjectFactoryBean     parentdefaultJMSDestination lazyinittruegt     ltproperty namejndiName         valuequeue.lingo.com.test.myqueue gt ltbeangt  ltbean idmyJMSProducer classorg.logicblaze.lingo.jms.JmsProxyFactoryBean     dependsonmyJMSConsumer lazyinittrue destroymethoddestroygt     ltproperty nameserviceInterface         valuecom.test.common.service.MyService gt     ltproperty nameconnectionFactory refwlsQueueConnectionFactory gt     ltproperty nameconnectionFactory refcachedTestQueueConnectionFactory gt     ltproperty namedestination refmyJMSDestination gt     ltproperty namemetadataStrategy reflingoMetadataStrategy gt     ltproperty nameproducerConfig refmyProducerConfig gt ltbeangt   ltbean idmyJMSConsumer     classorg.logicblaze.lingo.jms.JmsServiceExporterMessageListener     destroymethoddestroygt     ltproperty nameservice refmyService gt     ltproperty nameserviceInterface         valuecom.test.common.service.MyService gt     ltproperty nameconnectionFactory refwlsQueueConnectionFactory gt ltbeangt  ltbean idmyServiceMsgContainer parentbaseMsgListenerContainergt     ltproperty namemessageListener refmyJMSConsumergt     ltproperty nameconnectionFactory refwlsQueueConnectionFactorygt     ltproperty namedestination refmyJMSDestinationgt     ltproperty namemaxConcurrentConsumers value5gt ltbeangt codepre  pPart of my business logic calls the myService codecallProducercode async method via reflection.p  pAfter I restart WLS JMS while keeping alive my application, I see a series of messages saying codeDefaultMessageListenerContainer  Successfully refreshed JMS Connectioncode.

Negative 759 pConsider the following HTML fragment codecode is used for whitespacep  precodeltheadgt     ...     ltlink ... gt     lt ... gt     ... ltheadgt codepre  pIm using Html Agility Pack HAP to read HTML filesfragments and to strip out links. What I want to do is find the codeLINKcode and some other elements and then replace them with whitespace, like sop  precodeltheadgt     ...          lt ... gt     ... ltheadgt codepre  pThe parsing part seems to be working so far, I get the nodes Im looking for. However, HAP tries to fix the HTML content while I need everything to be emexactlyem the same, except for the changes Im trying to make. Plus, HAP seems to have quite a few bugs when it comes to writing back content that was read in previously, so the approach I want to take is let HAP parse the input and then I go back to the original input and replace content that I dont want.p  pThe problem is, codeHtmlNodecode doesnt seem to have an input length property. It has codeStreamPositioncode which seems to indicate where reading of the nodes content started within the input but I couldnt find a length property thatd tell me how many characters were consumed to build the node.p  pI tried using the codeOuterHtmlcode propety but, unfortunately, HAP tries to fix the codeLINKcode by removing the codecode part a codeLINKcode element is not supposed to be closed. Because of this, codeOuterHtml.Lengthcode returns the wrong length.p  pIs there a way in HAP to get this informationp

Negative 759 pI am working on creating a Metro Style App in Windows 8 using the HTML5JavaScript framework.

Negative 759 pIm new to sf2twig and I think Im missing a point somewherep  pI have a layout with a header, twocolumn middle part and footer.

I use twigs template inheritance to put my content into the main area and where otherwise required.p  pNow, there are some sections of our page where the content area must take up the whole width, so the sidebar on the right isnt displayed for these sections. To achieve this, I have to apply a different CSS class to the main content area and, obviously, dont render the sidebars content.p  pIt would be cool if I could use a variable in the main template like code if singlecolumnlayout code, with a default value of codefalsecode, which I could overwrite in the child template when needed.

Negative 759 pIve been using Metro and have come across a problem whereby wsgen seems to ignore any JAXB annotation that I put on web method response classes.p  pIm trying to return a set of entity classes that I want to expose to external clients via a web service, however I only want to make certain class attributes and methods visible to external clients, so have set the class access type to be PROPERTY, and have annotated all attributes I want to be part of the XML version of the class with XmlElement.p  pI can create the XML schema for the entity class using the schemagen ant task, which correctly ignores any attribute or method that I have not annotated with XmlElement, however when I run wsgen to create the wsdl for the web service which has a method which returns a set of the entity class, then I get a java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError. This appears to be because wsgen is not ignoring a public method on the entity class that it should do, with the class referenced by the exception being a parameter to this method.p  pIve tried to annotate the method with XmlTransient so that wsgen ignores it, but to no avail. If anyone can suggest what I should do to get wsgen to pay attention to my annotations then that would be great.p

Negative 759 pI have an error with arithmetic overflow inserting values into a lookup table with a rowid set as TINYINT datatype. This IS NOT a case where the number of unique records exceeds 255 values.

Negative 759 pIm trying to use Boosts normal distribution to generate random numbers given different seeds. In other words, I need the same random numbers produced for seed1, seed2, etc. thousands of seeds will be passed to the function over the course of the simulation. The random number generator will never be used unseeded. strong[Edit Key is a better word than seedsee final description block below.]strong Im not sure whether it makes the most sense to generate a single RNG and reseed it and if so, how or if its easier to generate a new one each time. Heres what I have so far, which involves the construction of a new, seeded rng at each request for a random normal numberp  pprecode double rnorm int thisSeed     boostmt19937 rng thisSeed    boostnormaldistributionlt nd 0.0, 1.0   mean, sd   boostvariategenerator  varnor rng, nd    return varnor  precodep  pIs this dumb Im new to PRNGs and especially Boosts implementation.p  hr  pstrongA more thorough description of why Im doing thisstrongp  pI am creating a huge random energy landscape to simulate protein interactions each sequence has a particular energy thats calculated as the sum of quenched Gaussian random numbers that depend on the values of particular amino acids at particular positions and a few other sequence attributes. I want to use the PRNG to calculate what these pseudorandom values are these values must be consistent the same sequence should yield the same values, but there are way too many to store. As a simple example, I might have a sequence ARNDAMR and compute its total energy based on two subenergies one is a random normal number that depends on having A in position 1 and D at position 4, and the other subenergy is a random number that depends on the last three amino acids. Im converting the configurations into keys for use as seeds arguments for my PRNG. Many thousands of sequences will be constructed and mutated, so I need a way to compute energies quicklyso I need to know how best to seed and call my RNG. I will not be using the Boost RNG for anything other than these energy value lookups.p  hr  pstrongFurther tldr explanationstrongp  pI am going to have key values that are integers between 1 and 106 or 107. I want each to map to a Gaussian random number. There should not be any crosscorrelation between the key values and their numbers e.g., keys 145148 should not map to autocorrelated random numbers.p  pI need a given key to return the same random number each time it the key is called in the simulation. I do not want to store the keyrandom number pairs in a lookup table. p
Negative 759 pHow would I send request data from a POST request to a GET request using Scala PlayUsing Play Framework 2.1.1p  pMy goal is to have a single page Reports that works like this The report is a GET request, so if needed you could bookmark this report. The report consists of a table of models, and each model row has a delete button at the end. I want to click the delete button, have it post the id to my controller then reload the page with the reports filter parameters still on. p  pCurrently I have the delete button just adding to the get, which works correctly but the removeid parameter stays in the requestaddress bar. Therefore it tries to delete this model every time the page is reloaded. What I would like to do is have this form POST and then remove the model, then send all the request parameters other than remove to a GET request. p  pI would rather do this without javascriptAJAX.p

Negative 759 pmy problem is, that PySerial seems to lose some data packages and I dont know why. p  pI have two python scripts, the first one reads data from a text file and writes it to a microcontroller, where the data is manipulated. Then, the microcontroller sends the modified data over a different serial port back to the PC. for clarification I need two serial ports, because in the final application, the scripts will be running on different PCs. However, for testing purpose, it is easier to run both scripts on one PCp  pSo basically, my hardware setup looks like p  precodePC serial port 1gt microcontroller    ltserial port 2  codepre  pAfter writing the data to the microcontroller I am expecting to get a certain amount of data bytes back.

Negative 759 pI just started having this weird problem.p  pSummary of eventsp  pA tableLayout is being populated programmatically. A different tableLayout containing a fixed row in it, on top of this programmatically populated tableLayout, containing headings 4 textViews for them. It appears perfectly when the activity is loaded. Besides, A banner ad at the bottom in this activity, and an Interstitial ad request made in onCreate and presented in onPause.p  pProblemp  pAs soon as the banner ad displays at the bottom, the 4 heading text views disappear As i could not find any means to set a visibilityChangedListener for the textviews, i used different colour backgrounds for the table layout, table row, and the text view, which tells me that the problem is with textviews, though the table row is there using a touch listener for row, and the colour markings. this does not happen when im commenting out the banner ad load statement interstitial ad still working, not happening when my device is not connected to internet. Ive a Nexus4 JB4.3 on which this happened, but no issues on emulator 3.2 GB2.3.3 included in AVD Manager. Even funnier is that the only place where I am using those text views is to get layoutParams to be set in the dynamic text views created which appear fine.p  pLayoutp  precodeltRelativeLayout

I works perfectly.p  pthen I want to return an ArrayList of all those names in order to use them in the servlet.

The user can either swipe them to delete or go into edit mode and click multiple rows to delete faster much like in mail. p  pAt the bottom of the screen there is a finish button where the user will click when she has finished choosing the exercises they want in their workout. Currently I am trying to bring up the toolbar when the user enters edit mode to allow them to delete their multiple choices.

This isnt what I want as it looks stupid to be able to finish while editing something else.p  pI have tried hiding the button but this leaves a white square just above the toolbarp  pI am not sure if I need to make the button transparent or if I am hiding it incorrectly.p  pHow can I have the bottom button disappear completely when edit mode is entered to the extent it doesnt affect my table view and then reappear and almost swap with the tool bar when editing mode is exitedp  precode voidsetEditingBOOLediting animatedBOOLanimated        Activates multiple selection     exercisesSelectedTableView.allowsMultipleSelectionDuringEditing  editing       Lets us know we have clicked editing  changes it to done     [super setEditingediting animatedanimated]      if editing           This bit is done when someone clicks edit           Sets the view into editing mode         [exercisesSelectedTableView setEditingediting animatedYES]           Unhides the tool bar         [self.navigationController setToolbarHiddenNO animatedYES]           Hides the finish button         [finishedButton setHiddenYES]          else            This bit is called once someone clicks done          [self.navigationController setToolbarHiddenYES animatedYES]           Reveals finish button          [finishedButton setHiddenNO]          [super setEditingNO animatedYES]         [exercisesSelectedTableView setEditingNO animatedYES]       codepre

Negative 759 pGood morning all,p  pIm new to C, and I have to update an already developed application, where I intend to add some new features. Ive opened it in Visual Studio 2012 and rebuilt it, apparently with no errors. When I run it, the GUI appears correctly, but when I start the application an error occursp  blockquote   pA first chance exception of type System.DllNotFoundException occurred in MccDaq.dll   An unhandled exception of type System.DllNotFoundException occurred in MccDaq.dll   Additional information Unable to load DLL cbw32.dll The specified module could not be found. Exception from HRESULT 0x8007007Ep blockquote  pIve searched the last couple of days for a solution, but I havent found any. Among many others, I found this thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9003072unabletoloaddllmodulecouldnotbefoundhresult0x8007007eUnable to load DLL Module could not be found HRESULT 0x8007007Ea, unfortunately with no luck for me. In fact, searching for the aforementioned DLL cbw32.dll, I wasnt able to find it anywhere in my files. Also, as pointed out in the thread, Ive installed Dependency Walker, and analysed MccDaq.dll the file where the System.DllNotFoundException occurred, where errors appear againp  blockquote   pError Modules with different CPU types were found.   Warning At least one module has an unresolved import due to a missing export function in a delayload dependent module.p blockquote  pGoogling for this bring little or nothing new, apart from understanding that apparently, Im having problems with the CPUs architecture in several DLLs, and so here I am. Again I must underline that Im new to C, so it wouldnt be surprising that some rookie error is being made here. Nevertheless, heres the code block that triggers the error in Visual Studiop  precodepublic ErrorInfo StartBoardMccDaq.ErrorReporting r, MccDaq.ErrorHandling h           only create another object if the configs are different         ifdaqBoard  null  daqBoard.BoardNum  boardNum               daqError  MccDaq.MccService.ErrHandlingr, h             daqBoard  new MccDaq.MccBoardboardNum             daqError  daqBoard.DConfigPortportNum, direction                   return daqError      codepre  pAnother detail that can be important here is that this application was made about 4,5 years ago, so my guess is that it must be programmed using Visual Studio 2008. Regarding this, Ive changed, in the project properties, the Target Framework to .NET Framework 3.5, again with no success the behaviour does not change.p  pConcluding, I found many different directions where I can go, and that led me to confusion. If someone can enlighten me on this, Id be totally grateful.p

Negative 759 pI have a game concept being designed in UDK, using a firstperson camera. By default, you can only look i.e. rotate the camera so far up and so far down, but the effect I want to achieve is for the player to be able to look down at themselves so they can see the feet of the player characters model, as you can in the game Outlast for anyone whos familiar with that.p  pIm a programmer more than a designer, so Im hoping theres a scripting solution to this.

Presumably there are min and max values for rotation angles hiding somewherep  pAny suggestions would be appreciated.p

I can see this by putting a breakpoint in my debugger. When I have lots of entities, surely this will make the responsiveness of the page very bad. In my code example, if I have 100 payees, then the validation code will execute 400 times one for each of 4 properties on each of 100 payees, when really, it only needs to execute 4 times.p  pMy question is Is there a way of making the validation happen only for the entity that is currently in edit mode, or equivalently, only for the inputs that are not hiddenp

Negative 759 pI am trying to make a simple Arduino game that keeps track of the number of times a button has been pressed. There are two buttons, one for each user, and whoever is closest to the random number that the Arduino picks, wins. winning being a light comes on next to the winers button. However I am stuck in what seems to be a rutbefore I go further, I will divulge that I am just barely two weeks old into the whole arduinoC environment so my knowledge is pretty low. p  pBasically what I want to happen is that the game lasts a certain amount of time, lets say 5 seconds, then after the five seconds, all the button pushes are tallied and compared and a winner is picked. Then the game resets itself and we can play again. Where I am getting stuck at is in the timing function. I originally was subtracting a codegameClockcode variable from the codemilliscode function however I have read that it is bad practice to reset the codemilliscode function.

Negative 759 pIn my Assembly Language book, the Virtual Machine Levels are listed as followsp  ul liLevel 4 HighLevel Languageli liLevel 3 Assembly Languageli liLevel 2 Instruction Set Architecture ISA li liLevel 1 Digital Logicli ul  pAccording to the book, Level 2 ISA are instructions for the processor the ISA is also referred to as emmachine languageem. Each instruction in this level gets executed either directly by the computers hardware or by a program embedded in the microprocessor chip called a emmicroprogramem.p  pAbove Level 2, is the Assembly Language level 3, programming languages that provide translation layers to make largescale software development practical. This level uses short mnemonics like ADD, SUB, and MOV that can be easily translated to the ISA on level 2. These type of programs must be translated, or assembled, entirely into machine language at the ISA level before they can be executed.p  pTop tier is Level 4, highlevel programming languages such as C, C, and Java. These are stated as languages containing powerful statements that translate into multiple assembly language instructions.p  pThat being said, Im not quite following what the relationship is between a highlevel language, say Java in this case, and Assembly Language. In my view highlevel languages are simplified to where a single programmed statement may inherently perform many code lines worth of functionality, unlike assembly which needs an explicit statement for each action.p  pCan anyone provide some input to clear it up for me This is my first time looking into Assembly, and it thus far is a very different world than my experience in C.p

Negative 759 pI have a RelativeLayout A, inside which I have 2 children  LinearLayout B with some stuff   below it I have another RelativeLayout Cp  pI wanted to add an overlay on top of it. So all I did was added a View with matchparent as its width and height, and transparent background. All works great, as long as I do not add views dynamically to the nested RelativeLayout C.p  pWhen I do that my overlay stops at the last element that was not added dynamically to the RelativeLayout C. So the height of the overlay does not matchparent anymore.p  pI tried to go around it, and add the overlay after I add those dynamically added views to C, but that also didnt do the trick.p  pWhat does the trick is if I set height explicitaly to the overlay after all views are created by getting getHeight of the main root of the view. That is however not the solution I want, as I want a clean solution, that I explained above.p  pCurrently what I did to bypass it for the moment, is I added an overlay with a humongous heightlike 2000dip and set its bottom alignment to RelativeLayoutC. That does the trick perfectly the effect of it, however I still would preffer to know the reason why adding dynamicaly those views does not update the height of the overlay also if I add it dynamically after previous views.p  pJust to mention, I tried to do requestLayout, invalidate, and postInvalidate on the main container after all views were added. No change.p  pps. Might be important piece of information this root RelativeLayout stated in the beginning is inside a LinearLayout, which is a single child of a ScrollViewp

Negative 759 pI have two tables in my SQLite database one is a table of everything codemaincode, another is a favorites table codefavoritescode and I want to load a codeCursorcode for my codeListViewcode and have a star greyed out or yellow if its in codefavoritescode. Both tables have the exact same columns and I was hoping to load a codeCursorcode with these columns and an additional column codefavoritecode that can be a boolean or a 1 or 0. The favorite row is simply copied from the codemaincode table, so its contents will be the same. Then, when the star is tapped, update the codefavoritescode table and call codenotifyDataSetChangedcode on my adapter and that should update the codeListViewcode.p  pIve tried using codeJOINcode and loading tables with codeAScode aliases but Im having trouble. Can anyone help me with a SQLite query to achieve this Thank youp

Negative 759 pI am new to matlab, though i have done a fair amount of programming in R and java. I am trying to save a file using the save function in matlab. The name of the file I want to save to should contain a string read from a .txt file. p  precode sp500textreadCUsersPaulDownloadsalgosp500.txt,s  savesp500i,cleanedVolume codepre  pBut when I try this, I get the error Argument must contain a string.p  pIf I understand correctly, sp500 is a cell array of character arrays. So perhaps the reason why matlab doesnt like this is that I am trying to use a char array instead of a string. I have looked everywhere on the internet, and nowhere does it say how to convert a character array to a string in matlab. Or alternatively, if anyone could explain how to read this text file into cell array of string instead, that would probably be good enough for me to get it to work. but if someone could please explain what is going on here, i.e. why the readtxt returns character cells even though I specified the string format, why there is no built in function for reading string from a file and why you cant easily convert from a character array to a string, that would be great. p  pCould someone please help me with this thanks, Paulp

Negative 759 pI am implementing an algorithm using php. Also for RSA encryption of text, phpseclibs RSA implementation is being used. I am successfully able to encrypt  decrypt the values.

This result again will be used in further  calculations which in later case will be decrypted. Equations are mathematically proven correct, not giving details of algorithm because of privacy amp copyright issuep  pMathematically all this works well, but I chose phpseclibs RSA implementation. This is first time I am using the library functions. I did go through the documentation of phpseclib, but couldnt find a way to do it. There will be way I am sure, may be I am out of patience to identify it.p  pIt would of great help, if someone finds me a workaround for this issue. I am also ready for changing library in implementation i.e. anything else apart from phpseclib which can provide this functionality. I just hope there is way for it, or should I implement my own RSA methods p  pVersion of phpseclib is 0.3.6p

Negative 759 pIm interested in learning more about how to write good unit tests for an AngularJS project.p  pWe are using Karma, but currently we do not have an instructure for generating fixtures to mock our REST API. So, I ended up including the fixtures in my test setup, for examplep  precodevar joesBankAccount       addressUuid  testxyz     accountHolder  Joe,     accountNumber  123,     iban  DETEST123,     bic  ABC,     bankCode  123456,     bankName  MyBank,     bankCountry  Deutschland,     sepaMandat      codepre  pIm not sure whether that technique works very well once the REST API changes. I would prefer to only specify what I need for my tests, and let the other parts be provided by a test data builder e.g., something like Factory Girl for Ruby.p  pSo, I would prefer to write something minimal like thisp  precodevar joesBankAccount  bankAccountFixture.create   accountHolder Joe,   accountNumber 123   mock REST service  ...   some action  ...  expectscope.accountHolder.toBeJoe expectscope.accountNumber.toBe123 codepre  pCan you recommend a Javascript library for fixture generation Or do you think  a library is not actually neededp  pIf you can recommend some welltested opensource projects that use AngularJS with a REST service backend, it would also be great.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pAfter contemplating over Engineers nice lightweight solution with codeangular.extendcode and codeangular.copycode, I wonder if my actual example is misleading. Currently, our REST implementation more or less returns flat JSON objects. However, when I look at other REST APIs, the results are more structured, and they can also return collections.p  pIn other words, as long as the REST response is easy as in my example, a library cannot offer very much. However, in general, the response will be more complicate, so maybe libraries still have some edge. p  pOn the other hand, if the response from the REST service becomes too complicated, from what I hear, it is recommended to encapsulate the logic in a service. Then you can just mock the service, and again end up with an simple example.p

Negative 759 pIm primarily a desktop application developer but Ive been doing some web design projects recently and realized that I was doing significantly more switching between files while getting significantly less work done.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pWhen developing desktop applications, my favorite part is determining the best design patterns and data structures to use in order to minimize coupling and maximize cohesion. However, with web design, I seem to be all over the place in terms of structure. The large number of required scriptingprogramming languages has a lot to do with it. Even though I understand them, sometimes it is mentally exhausting getting them to work together perfectly. In just one project, you might use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, XML, CVB, etc. Then, each has an arbitrary number of files and making a single change in one might require changes in numerous other files. In a world of abstraction, I would think that the whole process would be made much more concise and uniform. p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  pI typically use a MVC design so that I can design the view, link all of the triggers to the controller, and work on the controllermodel without ever having to touch the view again. Is there a way to simulate this in web design How well do design pattern from desktop applications port to web applications Is there a way just to reduce the coupling feeling p

However, rather than executing this line, the program just keeps going. Since the next line is a call back to the start of the shellcode, an infinite loop is created.

Negative 759 pIs there an acceptedbetter method to aggregate boolean data in an Access query p  pI have two related tables, the first table contains a grouped summary of the data from the second. One of the fields in the second table is a boolean yesno flag indicating that the row requires attention. p  pI was planning on essentially performing an OR across the rows of the second table and storing the result in the first table to indicate that at least one of the associated rows from table 2 needs attention.p  pI see Access stores False as a 0 and True as a 1 and so have just used a SUMGROUP BY and seem to have achieved the result I was aiming for. Each True value 1 SUMs and gives me a negative number which Access seems happy to interpret as a True. However I notice that there doesnt seem to be any way to perform an AND operation multiplication which made me think this method Im using is a bit of a hack and may have some unintended consequences. p

Negative 759 pIm developing a C solution using MVVM with a Silverlight Telerik RadGrid.  I have a View that contains 3 grids, each with a set of checkboxes above it.

Negative 759 pI already searched within SO for some threads about this, but could only find some which explained what this header is for or how to get the authorization header in c but I dont want to read it from server side but from client side.p  pIs there any way to get the Base64 encoded header Authorization from the browser I want to implement a tool where you can log in and if you click on a spezific button your username will be saved.p  pMy problem is that the browser does the authorization automatically, and with jQuery and JavaScript methods you can only set the requestheaders and get the responseheaders. I couldnt find a method to get the requestheaders.p  pThe library a hrefhttpwww.searchnc.comgetheaders.html relnofollowgethttpa could get some headers, but not the authorization header. My guess is that this header is hidden.p  pIm doing a login via SVN and the browser does the authorization the moment you enter the website.p  pOnly the username is enough.

Negative 759 pIn Java application, I used Hibernate Lob for storing large content files, images, xml content, etc. in PostgreSQL 9.x. Hibernate automatically stores the said content into pglargeobject table. However during update operation of database tables which references pglargeobject table, it causes a duplicate copy of the same data added into pglargeobject. The old references of the same data in pglargeobject were abandoned. This is a side effect of using pglargeobject even though I dont update the large content. This behavior increases the size of the database without owners knowledge. I already knew that we can use VACCUM configuration ON in database to cleanup abandoned data. But to avoid this situation, we changed our java code, means changed the datatype for the said column as BYTEA instead of Large Object if we remove Lob declaration from hibernate entity, it will be automatically mapped as bytea type.p  pNow the question is the backward compatibility. If we change the datatype of a column in existing table, how to migrate or port the existing production data into new datatype for the above scenario. Thanks in advance for your feedback.p

Negative 759 pIm currently working on a C project that involves players, each player will need information stored about him on the server in order to determine what hes doing or how it should respond. The server can have up to 1000 slots, and I dont want to leave unused memory just allocated to the program and not created and destroyed when the player connects or joins.p  pI understand that I can allocate memory dynamically like thisp  precodeint Pointer  new int Example[10] codepre  pThis would allow me to store 10 integers which I could hold some information on that player. However what I dont know and why Im asking this questionp  pHow can I use this, or something with a similar function to store information on the player. Like a struct or a class made specifically to hold that players data. Then delete it once he leavesp  pAn example of what I would need it to hold would be a mixed range of valuesp  precodedouble Pos[3] int Mode string Name codepre  pIn other words I need it hold a mixed type of variables, and be able to link this directly back to the player ID it relates top  pThanks.p

Negative 759 pI am developing a stock market finance application, where I have to generate buy and sell signals based on some custom algorithm.  I am getting data for this from an excel file, which is changed on every tick. I have written Excel VBA for saving data in SQL Server db so that I can use it in my .net application. My calculations are dependent on every tick. One way I can get data into my app is by polling. But I do not think it is a good application design since I have to poll db every second. This is not an optimal solution. So I would like to know If I could execute code in .net when new record is inserted in database like some kind of insert trigger in .net app. p  pOther question which is not relevant to title, but is relevant to my application. This is first time I am developing a financial application. So would like to know some tips on optimal handling of data which is streaming every second in some cases micro seconds. I have to get data, monitor and calculate for every tick without much delay. It is very important that I apply calculations for every tick instantly.  so requesting any one to help me with some tips on application design. The only consolation in this application is the data which I am getting in Excel is for only few selected scrips instead of all scrips which will be very huge.p  pThanks in advance...p

But because I have to do this more than 500 times a second, I want to optimize it as much as possible. I know that floating point numbers are represented in IEEE754 and therefore, multiplying and dividing by a power of 2 should be rather fast basically just changing the mantissa, but how to do that most efficiently Should I simply stick with just multiplying code2x1code, or is multiplying by code2.0fcode and subtracting y better, or could I even do that more efficiently by performing a leftshift on the mantissa And if that is possible, how to implement that properly Thank you very muchp

Negative 759 pIm developing a genetic cellular automata using PyCuda. Each cell will have a lot of genome data, along with cell parameters. Im wondering what could be a most efficient way to 1 pass cells data to a CUDA kernel, then 2 to process this data.p  pI began with one particularly bad imo, yet still working solution. It was passing each parameter in a separate array, then process them with a switchcase and a lot of duplicate code.p  pThen, realized that I could quickly end up with pretty large number of parameters per kernel function, and decide to rewrite it.p  pSecond solution was to store all bunch of cells parameters in a single array with extra dimension. That was much more elegant in code, but surprisingly the strongcode runs 10x slowerstrongp  pTo make it more clear, the full list of data I need to be stored per cellp  ul liFc, Mc, Tc 3x int  the cells current flavor, mass and temperatureli liRfc, Rmc, Rtc 3x int  the cells current registersli liFi, Mi, Ti for each neighbour 83x int  incoming valuesli liRfi, Rmi, Rti for each neighbour 83x int  incoming valuesli ligate orientation 1x ucharli liexecution pointer 1x ucharli licurrent microoperations memory 32x ucharli lilast steps microoperations memory 32x ucharli ul  pIm splitting an automata step in 2 phases.

Negative 759 pIm working on a Ninja JSONbased application in which I am implementing JSR303Validation annotations across multiple controller methods. Im currently checking validations in the controllers themselves by passing in the Validation object and calling codevalidation.hasBeanViolationscode to see if there are failures. If there are, Im returning a failing Result to the client. p  pRather than doing this in the controller, I would like to validate requests using a Filter. However, Im at a loss as to how to go about doing this Could somebody help As far as I can tell, you cant pass validations to a filter as a parameter, and the context.getValidation object does not seem to be catching any validation failures.p

Negative 759 pI am having trouble with validation for integers in a WPF window.  My business object has an codeAgeintcode property.  I want to validate that codeAge gt 5code.  I see how to do this with codeIDataErrorInfocode and setting codeValidatesOnDataErrorscode to true.  That works if I enter in a number.  But if I enter an empty string or codeabccode, the validation code isnt getting called.  This is a problem because I have a button that I want to be enabled only if the validation code succeeds.p  pAccording to my Output Window, the problem is that the default converter is throwing a codeFormatExceptioncode in the codeConvertBackcode method.  This prevents the code from calling the codeIDataErrorInfo.this[string columnName]code method.  Im currently using the default codeintcode converterp  pIve read about a couple of solutions to this, but they either dont work, or seem hackyp  ol liemUse a Nullableltintgtem.  This doesnt prevent the exception.li liemUse a string instead of an intem.  This would work, but it doesnt allow me to take advantage of builtin WPF features.  It feels like a hack.li liemI thought I might be able to use my own codeIValueConvertercodeem to intercept the ConvertBack call, but I need to give the converter access to the my business object so that it can set some kind of codeIsValidboolcode property.

Negative 759 pIm not entirely sure what happened, but all of a sudden anytime I make a change to one of my .scss files in my assets folder, as soon as I save it a .css version is automatically created in my assets directory.p  pFor example, lets say Im working in somepage.css.scss. I add a few lines of code and hit Cmd  S. Immediately, somepage.css is added to the current directory. This is messy, especially from a version control standpoint because if I decide against a change I still have those new files I have to delete, because now I have both a .css and an .scss version for the same page in the same directory. p  pI cant for the life of me figure out whats going on or why this started all of a sudden.

Negative 759 pIm trying to create a naive numerical integration function to illustrate the benefits of Monte Carlo integration in high dimensions. I want something like thisp  precodedef quadintf, mins, maxs, numPoints100          Use the naive Riemann sum method to numerically integrate f on a box      defined by the mins and maxs.      INPUTS     f          A function handle. Should accept a 1D NumPy array          as input.     mins       A 1D NumPy array of the minimum bounds on integration.     maxs       A 1D NumPy array of the maximum bounds on integration.     numPoints  An integer specifying the number of points to sample in          the Riemannsum method. Defaults to 100.          n  lenmins       Create a grid of evenly spaced points to evaluate f on      Evaluate f at each point in the grid sum all these values up     dV  np.prodmaxsminsnumPoints      Multiply the sum by dV to get the approximate integral codepre  pI know my codedVcode is going to cause problems with numerical stability, but right now what Im having trouble with is creating the domain.

Negative 759 pRecently I renamed all the packages and removed all the files to another folder in Github. p  pAfter that, each time I open up github it asked to commit some files that have no change at all. Basically, it looks like every line of code in a files was deleted and copied again. Those files were edited and committed by others, and I am sure I have synchronized all the files. I am using eclipse to work with it, but I dont think the problem is from IDE.p  pCan anyone give me a clue about what could possibly cause it Thanks for your help.p

Negative 759 pIm getting the feeling this wont be possible, but worth asking anyway I guess.p  pI have a background sprite and a foreground sprite, both are the same size as the windowview.p  pAs the player sprite moves across the screen I want to delete the pixels it touches to reveal the background sprite.p  pThis is not just for display purposes, I want the gaps the player has drawn or dug out of the foreground layer to allow enemies to travel through, or objects to fall into. So hit detection will be needed with the foreground layer.p  pThis is quite complex and maybe Cocos2DJS is not the best platform to use, if not possible could you recommend another which would be easier to achieve this effect withp

Negative 759 pI am trying to learn Java, coming from a Cassembly embedded systems background.  After a few weeks of learning, I thought it would be fun to try and make a game, but I am having some problems with a JPanel being repainted at an inconsistent rate.  p  pMy game GUI consists of a single JFrame which contains a JPanel.  As you can see, the main thread for the JFrame sleeps for 30 milliseconds and then updates game logic and redraws the JFrame and JPanel.  Each time the JPanel is redrawn, I check that it took about 30 milliseconds.  As you would expect, it never takes more than about 32 milliseconds between frame redraws.p  pIn spite of the fact that the JPanel is definitely repainted every 30 milliseconds or so, The animation in it can be very jerky.  On Ubuntu 14.10, it is extremely obvious, even though the time between calls to my JPanels repaint are still never more than 32ms apart.p  pThe most vexing thing is that if I uncomment the linesp  precodethis.resize300  a, 300 a  a  101 codepre  pin SimFrame.java, everything is perfectly smooth, which implies that my computer has the strongcapabilitystrong to update the JPanel at the rate I want.p  pIs there some way I can force the JFrame to update at the rate I want it to without doing the absurd .resize callp  pMain.javap  precodepackage jdemo import javax.swing.JFrame import

Negative 759 pFairly new to C and programming in general. Im trying to write out a program that would read the following input.txtp  precode10 4 6 A 15 6 B 20 10 B 12 8 A 54 12 B 64 9 A 73 30 A 80 10 B 99 15 codepre  pAs shown, theres a combination of int variables as well as char A and B. Using ifstream, the program recognizes the first three int 10, 4, 6 perfectly fine. However, Im trying to figure out a way for it to sort out the remaining variables into specific arrays. p  pFor instance, I want it to recognize that every time theres an A, the first int after that A goes into one array and the following int goes into another array. So in this case we would have the arrays [15,54,73,80] and [6,12,30,10]. p  pPlease note that the input.txt is not set and I need to be able to have it read the file with different number of As and Bs.p

Negative 759 pThe downside to a SPA is of course the initial load time.p  pFor example, I have created AskACarPro.com with Durandal.p  pIt currently has a loading screen while it loads.  But I am thinking maybe this is a bad idea.  It reminds me of an allflash website  pretty, but noone wants to watch a loading spinner when they first get to a site.p  pAnother example I found at random is MyBestEgg.com  It is a Angular site.  Nothing special, but it has a cold load time of almost 6 seconds on my machine.p  pBut it has no splash so the screen jumps around a bit while it is loading. I dont know that this is any better than a splash screen.p  pIs there a best practice to dealing with the inevitable SPA load time  Obviously the app should be bundled and minified as much as possible, but there is always going to be a delay while the app starts up.p  pThis is perhaps more of a designer type question than a programming question.  Yet it is important as the load factor is a reason NOT to use a SPA.p

Negative 759 pIm working on a webapp that utilizes UIRouter and many nested views. Our main views use Flex to take up all available space on the screen both height and width. I say this to identify why we have so many nested flex containers.p  pstrongTLDRstrongp  pa hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netrL0r8nez4 relnofollowJSFiddle showing the problemap  pOn IE and Chrome, the following JSFiddle works the way you would expect. All outer divs fit to the page, while the innermost div has a scrollbar for the overflowing content inside. p  pOn Firefox the scrollbar is on the body, or one of the outer divs, and the containers dont really work at all.p  pI need consistent behavior across all browsers, any ideasp  pstrongLonger explanationstrongp  pOur app works great on Chrome and IE10, but on Firefox the flex containers just dont seem to work the way we need them too. Our intention is for the lowermost flex container to have overflow auto and for the rest of them to simply fit to the screen without scroll bars. p  pIve tried to ensure were using all cross browser flex prefixes, so when we declare a flex container using LESS mixins the result is this p  precodedisplay webkitbox  OLD  iOS 6, Safari 3.16  display mozbox  OLD  Firefox 19 buggy but mostly works  display msflexbox  TWEENER  IE 10  display webkitflex  NEW  Chrome  display flex  NEW, Spec  Opera 12.1, Firefox 20  width 100  For old syntax, otherwise collapses.  codepre  pAnd when we declare something to flex, this is the outputp  precodewebkitboxflex 1  OLD  iOS 6, Safari 3.16  mozboxflex 1  OLD  Firefox 19  webkitflex 1  Chrome  msflex 1  IE 10  flex 1  NEW, Spec  Opera 12.1, Firefox 20      codepre  pThis results in many nested flex containers working beautiful on IE and Chrome, but Firefox does wacky things. On IEChrome, the innermost container contains the overflow and puts a scrollbar where its needed, while firefox either doesnt contain it at all or puts the scrollbar on the outer most container. Looks like firefox isnt honoring the flex at all hardly. p  pI need consistent behavior across all browsers, any ideas This needs to be a pure css solution as Im too far into the project to change my HTML structure all that much. p  pa hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netrL0r8nez4 relnofollowJSFiddle showing the problemap  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI tried the below implementation and it did not work, unfortunately.

If they enter, a message should appear as Employee Code has already been entered.p  pCan anyone tell how to achieve thisp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltaspGridView IDGridView2 runatserver stylemarginleft 23px margintop 11px Width420px CellPadding4 AutoGenerateColumnsFalse ForeColor333333 GridLinesNone Height213px  gt                ltAlternatingRowStyle BackColorWhite gt              ltColumnsgt                             ltaspTemplateField HeaderTextEmployee Codegt             ltItemTemplategt                 ltaspTextBox IDTxtEmpcode runatserver OnTextChangedTxtIdTextChanged AutoPostBack true   gtltaspTextBoxgt               ltItemTemplategtcodepre div div p
