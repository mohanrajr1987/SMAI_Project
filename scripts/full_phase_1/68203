Positive 68203 pWhen I use the example a hrefhttpsgithub.comn1k0casperjsblobmastersamplesdynamic.js relnofollowherea I find that a range of hashbang links on the same page that dynamically creates different content only generates the content the first time.

When I add the list in reverse order, every iteration uses the content of codepage3code.

Positive 68203 pI have some rather straightforward code that fetches some data from a url using codeXMLHttpRequestcode... all the usual stuff, nothing too unusual, e.g.p  precodevar request  new XMLHttpRequest request.onload  function  ...  request.openGET, url, true request.timeout  5000 request.send codepre  pWhen this code is run within a standard browser context, all is fine.  However, when invoked via phantomjs called on a server running a node.js app, the very same code only seems to work when coderequest.opencode is specified as being synchronous using codefalsecode as the final arg.  So in phantomjs it works fine when using sync, but not async.  When run async, the request never completes successfully.p  pIs there an obvious reason why this would be the case, in the absence of some further example code  Perhaps Ive broken some rule of phantomjs andor XMLHttpRequest.  p  pTill now Ive just accepted it, and ensured that the request is sync in phantomjs and async in the browser.  But now Im trying to set up timeouts correctly, since I suspect that timeout isnt working as it should in sync mode, but may do in async mode, so Im trying to make the call async even in phantomjs.  Even then, I have my concerns that timeout doesnt work as you might expect within phantomjs.p  pAny help specifically on the syncasync issue would be great, and even better would be some advice on getting timeout to work within phantomjs.p

Negative 68203 pIn the past Ive never been a fan of using triggers on database tables. To me they always represented some magic that was going to happen on the database side, far far away from the control of my application code. I also wanted to limit the amount of work the DB had to do, as its generally a shared resource and I always assumed triggers could get to be expensive in high load scenarios.p  pThat said, I have found a couple of instances where triggers have made sense to use at least in my opinion they made sense. Recently though, I found myself in a situation where I sometimes might need to bypass the trigger. I felt really guilty about having to look for ways to do this, and I still think that a better database design would alleviate the need for this bypassing. Unfortunately this DB is used by mulitple applications, some of which are maintained by a very uncooperative development team who would scream about schema changes, so I was stuck.p  pWhats the general consesus out there about triggers Love em Hate em Think they serve a purpose in some scenarios  Do think that having a need to bypass a trigger means that youre doing it wrongp
Negative 68203 pWe are currently using MySQL for a product we are building, and are keen to move to PostgreSQL as soon as possible, primarily for licensing reasons.p  pHas anyone else done such a move Our database is the lifeblood of the application and will eventually be storing TBs of data, so Im keen to hear about experiences of performance improvementslosses, major hurdles in converting SQL and stored procedures, etc.p  pEdit Just to clarify to those who have asked why we dont like MySQLs licensing. We are developing a commercial product which currently depends on MySQL as a database backend. Their license states we need to pay them a percentage of our list price per installation, and not a flat fee. As a startup, this is less than appealing.p

Negative 68203 pI am writing a tool to help students learn regular expressions.

What I think I need is a way to take any given regular expression and escape the metacharacters that arent part of a given flavor. Then I could give it to the Regex object and it would behave as if it was written for the selected RE interpreter.p  pFor example, given the following regexp  precodew[09]5d4 codepre  pAs a basic regular expression, it would be interpreted asp  precodew[09]5d4 codepre  pAs an extended regular expression, it would bep  precodew[09]5d4 codepre  pAnd as a Perlstyle regex, it would be the same as the original expression.p  pIs there a regular expression for regular expressions than I could run through a regex searchandreplace to quote the nonmeta characters What else could I do Are there alternative Java classes I could usep

Negative 68203 pAre there any good resources for porting a VB.NET winforms application to C  Im sure there are is software that just translates the code, but Im looking to refactor the code at the same time.  Keeping it in its current form is problematic, since it uses some of the bad design practices that VB.NET allows, and would further complicate future maintanence.

VB.NET isnt a language Im rock solid in. I do appreciate the irony of learning the language to port it over  but future maintenance will need to account for someone who doesnt know VB.NET.li liThe rest of the application has been ported to C a long time ago, in fact  all features that wed like to add depend on decoupling the app right now its very tightly coupled.  My choices are to either refactor it in a language Im not too familiar with, or to refactor it in a language I understand.  li ul  pTo anyone who voted the question down, Im not really sure emwhyem you did  the concern isnt whether I should leave it in VB.NET the concern is what is the future cost of not porting it over now.

Negative 68203 pIts not quite clear to me how I can design so I keep the reference to the DIcontainer in the composition root for a Silverlight  MVVM application.p  pI have the following simple usage scenario theres a main view perhaps a list of items and an action to open an edit view for one single item. So the main view has to create and show the edit view when the user takes the action e.g. clicks some button. p  pFor this I have the following codep  precodepublic interface IView     IViewModel ViewModel get set  codepre  pThen, for each view that I need to be able to create I have an abstract factory, like sop  precodepublic interface ISomeViewFactory     IView CreateView  codepre  pThis factory is then declared a dependency of the parent view model, like sop  precodepublic class SomeParentViewModel     public SomeParentViewModelISomeViewFactory viewFactory             store it         private void OnSomeUserAction           IView view  viewFactory.CreateView       dialogService.ShowDialogview              codepre  pSo all is well until here, no DIcontainer in sight . Now comes the implementation of ISomeViewFactoryp  precodepublic class SomeViewFactory  ISomeViewFactory      public IView CreateView              IView view  new SomeView         view.ViewModel            codepre  pThe  part is my problem, because the view model for the view needs to be resolved from the DIcontainer so it gets its dependencies injected. What I dont know is how I can do this without having a dependency to the DIcontainer anywhere except the composition root.p  pOne possible solution would be to have either a dependency on the view model that gets injected into the factory, like sop  precodepublic class SomeViewFactory  ISomeViewFactory      public SomeViewFactoryISomeViewModel viewModel               store it           public IView CreateView              IView view  new SomeView         view.ViewModel  viewModel       codepre  pWhile this works, it has the problem that since the whole object graph is wired up statically i.e. the parent view model will get an instance of SomeViewFactory, which will get an instance of SomeViewModel, and these will live as long as the parent view model lives, the injected view model implementation is stateful and if the user opens the child view twice, the second time the view model will be the same instance and have the state from before. I guess I could work around this with an Initialize method or something similar, but it doesnt smell quite right.p  pAnother solution might be to wrap the DIcontainer and have the factories depend on the wrapper, but itd still be a DIcontainer in disguise there p  pAny thoughts on this are greatly appreciated. Also, please forgive any mistakes or rulebreaking, since this is my first post on stackoverflow p  pThanksp  pps my current solution is that the factories know about the DIcontainer, and its only them and the composition root that have this dependency.p

Negative 68203 pHi I have a set of radio buttons for yes and no values which have a namechoice.  yes is checked by default. Theyre both runatserver.  I read the choice on postback like below.  It works perfectly fine as long as the validation doesnt fail.  For example, if I select no and validation fails on postback,  I still see no selected.

Negative 68203 pId like to use FactoryBeans and scopes together. Specifically, Id like the object created and returned by a FactoryBean to be placed into a specified perhaps custom scope. The issue is that doing the followingp  precodeltbean classx.y.z.TestFactoryBean scopetest gt codepre  pResults in the FactoryBean itself being scoped, and has somewhat unpredictable behaviour on the object created by the factory. I understand why this is the factory itself is a firstclass springmanaged bean, and has its own lifecycle. However, I cant find a way to specify that the object returned from the factory should itself be scoped.p  pOn the other hand, this does exactly what I want as long as TestFactoryBean does NOT implement the FactoryBean interfacep  precodeltbean classx.y.z.TestFactoryBean nametestFactorygt ltbean classx.y.z.TestBean factorybeantestFactory        factorymethodgetObject scopetest gt codepre  pSo the real question is, how can I make Spring behave like it does for the 2nd example above, but using real FactoryBeansp

Negative 68203 pI have an existing object hierarchy where some objects have fields that need to be injected. Also there are some other objects that are constructed using a hrefhttpcode.google.compgoogleguiceGoogle Guicea and need to be injected with references to some objects from previously described object hierarchy. How do I do such kind of injection with Guicep  pThe problem is that objects from existing hierarchy were not constructed using Guice, and therefore are not subject to inject process by default. There is, of course codeinjector.injectMemberscode method that is able to inject into existing object instance, but it does not work on object hierarchies.p  pFor those wondering why I cant build mentioned object hierarchy using Guice. This hierarchy represents GUI objects and is built by a GUI framework a hrefhttppivot.apache.orgApache Pivota from a declarative GUI description in fact this process can be described as object deserialization. That way interface construction is rather simple, and I only want to inject certain service references into interface objects and vice versa for callbacks.p  pApproach I am currently about to take is described below. p  pFor injecting into preexisting object hierarchy just let all objects that are interested in injection implement certain interface, likep  precodepublic interface Injectable    void injectAllInjector injector  codepre  pThose objects would then implement this interface like sop  precodepublic void injectAllInjector injector    injector.injectMembersthis   for Injectable child  children     child.injectAllinjector  codepre  pThen Id just call codemainWindow.injectAllinjectorcode for root object in hierarchy and all objects of interest are injected.p  pNot very nice solution, but gets the work done on one side. On the other side, I need to inject objects from this hierarchy. I guess it can be done via implementing custom provider for such objects.p  pIs there a better solution to my problem Maybe there is also something wrong with my approachp

My file has only one single sheet, and I can open it no problem with Excel 2007. p  pEven if I manually add some rows to the template and then add more rows with PHPExcel, Zoom will read the rows written manually by me, but not the rows written by PHPExcel.p  pThis is how Im doing itp  precode Starting with the PHPExcel library thisgtloadgtlibraryPHPExcel thisgtloadgtlibraryPHPExcelIOFactory templatefile  zoomtrackingtemplate.xls i  3  objReader  IOFactorycreateReaderExcel5 objPHPExcel  objReadergtloadtemplatefile objPHPExcelgtsetActiveSheetIndex0   Fetching ML payments foreachpayments as row   objPHPExcelgtgetActiveSheetgtsetCellValueA.i, VANESSA NEISZER  objPHPExcelgtgetActiveSheetgtsetCellValueB.i, 02127616116  objPHPExcelgtgetActiveSheetgtsetCellValueC.i, 1ER PISO MINITIENDAS 199 BLVD SABANA GRANDE, CRUCE C  CALLE NEGRIN  objPHPExcelgtgetActiveSheetgtsetCellValueD.i, rowgtmailingcity  objPHPExcelgtgetActiveSheetgtsetCellValueE.i, rowgtmailingname  objPHPExcelgtgetActiveSheetgtsetCellValueF.i, rowgtmailingname  objPHPExcelgtgetActiveSheetgtsetCellValueG.i, rowgtmailingpersonalid  objPHPExcelgtgetActiveSheetgtsetCellValueH.i, rowgtmailingphone  objPHPExcelgtgetActiveSheetgtsetCellValueI.i, rowgtmailingaddress1. .rowgtmailingaddress2  objPHPExcelgtgetActiveSheetgtsetCellValueJ.i, rowgtnickname  objPHPExcelgtgetActiveSheetgtsetCellValueK.i, 1  objPHPExcelgtgetActiveSheetgtsetCellValueL.i, 0.3  objPHPExcelgtgetActiveSheetgtsetCellValueM.i, M  objPHPExcelgtgetActiveSheetgtsetCellValueN.i, PRODUCTO  objPHPExcelgtgetActiveSheetgtsetCellValueO.i, 0   i    objPHPExcelgtsetActiveSheetIndex0  objWriter  IOFactorycreateWriterobjPHPExcel, Excel5   Sending headers to force the user to download the file headerContentType applicationvnd.msexcel headerContentDisposition attachmentfilenameEnvios.datedMy..xls headerCacheControl maxage0  objWritergtsavephpoutput codepre  pI have no clue of what PHP library they are using to read Excel files and I am certain they wont tell me if I ask them.

Negative 68203 pWhy I get the following error in the Visual Studio 2010 designer if a try to load the Form1 that hosts my custom control at designtimep  blockquote   pCould not find type myCustomControl. Please make sure that the assembly that    contains this type is referenced. If this type is a part of your development project, make sure that the project has been successfully built using settings for your current platform or Any CPU.br   The variable myCustomControl1 is either undeclared or was never assigned. p blockquote  pIt happens only when I add the reference to the .NET wrapper DLL without referencing the .NET wrapper DLL the Visual Studio designer loads correctly.

Negative 68203 pWe have a large ebusiness application server that is out of our control, we can not modify it in any way shape or form. The company behind this application server will also not modify it to our customers requirements. This is due to the fact that they see us as a competitor and they do not wish the customer to use our application as a front end to their application.p  pOur desktop application uses web services to communicate with this application server and each login from the desktop occupies a user slot on the server. The application server offers no functionality that enables us to figure out if a user slot is taken or not. The best solution would be for us to develop an application that sits in the middle of the application server and our desktop client, this application would manage the allocation and deallocation of user slots and the problem is solved. This solution has be declined as the customer does not want to install our application on the ebusiness application server as that would void the user support of said ebusiness server, the alternative would be an extra server but that is something they dont want to deal with.p  pWhich leaves us with the solution that our desktop application has write access to a shared folder. Each desktop application has a UID and we use that UID together with the user slot id and create a file UID.UserSlotId.locked. This would mean that each time a connection is made the desktop application would need to check this shared location and make sure they are not about to use a UserSlotId that is taken.p  pNow I now that the locked file is a terrible solution but the customer has requested this and no matter how much we inform them that this will never be a water tight solution they still want to go ahead. They are under the assumption that a 98 solution is a good solution. So what can the StackOverflow community offer in the way of advice with dealing with such a file locking systemp

Negative 68203 pI have a table with two timestamp fields.

Negative 68203 pI need to detect when another application window in my app does paste on my previously set data , so I can remove it from my source window. I have discovered that codeCOleDataSourceDelaySetDatacode emtheoreticallyem does this and codeCOleDataSourceOnSetDatacode would get called when paste occurs, but I can not be sure. MSDN is as usually vague about this matter and does not clearly say one way or the other.I will be using an custom format and watever format is explorer using for cutpaste files.

Negative 68203 pI am trying to understand the Layouting system in Silverlight, but I dont really know how the process works. I know that Measure is always called before and then when all the measures have been done the Arrange starts. But when exactly does this process start, and are we able to control it Please dont write de MSDN library link, I have already read it, and its not clear at all.. p  pMy specific situation is that I have some nested LinearLayouts inherit class from Panel and Arrangeoverride and MEasureoverride work but I need the rootcontainer sizebecause they sizes are pertentages of the parent, and I cant get it until all the elements are loaded in the tree, so I call arrange in LayoutRootLoaded. It works, yes, but It does the layouting process like 3 times and that is not efficient for the whole system... Can anybody help or at least explain how the Layouting system can be totally managed by the programmer p  pThank yyoouuuuuuuup

Negative 68203 pThis maybe too basic but I couldnt find an exact answer. Ill be happy to deleteclose this post if anyone point me to similar posts.p  pI want to call method getString to return a formatted string and set to my label like thisp  precodeNSString getString    NSString result  [NSString stringWithFormatblah blah , someOtherString]   return result   void viewDidLoad    someLabel.text  [self getString]  codepre  pThis code worked for me, but I am concerned that coderesultcode is allocated by a convenient method thus may be autoreleased before it got retained by the label. Is it true If so, when exactly would an object from convenient method get releasedp  pSecond question, if in case I have to use [NSString alloc] to create my own string object. Where and how should I release it p  pThanks in advance Leop

Negative 68203 pUbuntu 10.10 64bit athalon, gnomep  pMy basic scenario is Im connecting to a VPN service via newtworkmanager pptp protocol and Im transferring private data hence VPN. The service goes down intermittantly and thats alright, probably due to my ISPOSVPN. What is not good is that my applications will then continue to transmit data via the eth0 default route and thats not cool. After some looking around Im suspecting the best way to deal with this is to post scripts into etcNetworkManagerdispatcher.d. In short, the networkmanager service will execute scripts in this directory and pass arguments to the scripts when anything about the network changes.p  pMy problem is that I cant get any of my scripts to execute. They all have, per the manpage, 0755 permissions and owned by root, but when I change the network state by unplugging ethernet cable, my scripts dont execute. I can execute them from the command line, but not automatically via the dispatcher....p  pan example scriptp  precodebinsh e   exec usrbinwmctrl c qBittorrent  exit 0 codepre  pThis script is intentionally simple for testing purposes.. I can post whatever else would be helpful. p

Negative 68203 pSo recently I was given a problem, which I have been mulling over and am still unable to solve I was wondering if anyone here could point me in the right direction by providing me with the psuedo code or at least a rough outline of the pseudo code for this problem. PS Ill be building in PHP if that makes a difference...p  h2Specsh2  pThere are 50 people for this example Ill just call them a,b,c...  and the user is going to group them into groups of three people in the groups may overlap, and in the end there will be 50100 groups ie a,b,c d,e,f a,d,f b,c,l.... p  pemSo far it is easy, it is a matter of building an html form and processing it into a multidimensional arrayemp  hr  pThere are 15 time slots during the day eg 900AM, 920AM, 940AM.... Each of these groups needs to meet once during the day. And during one time slot the person cannot be double booked ie a cannot be in 2 different groups at 940AM.p  pemIt gets tricky here, but not impossible, my best guess at how to do this would be to brute force it pick out sets of groups that have no overlap eg a,b,c l,f,g q,n,d... and then just put each into a time slotemp  hr  pFinally, the schedule which I output needs to be optimized, by that I mean that a should have minimal time between meetings so if his first meeting is at 920AM, his second meeting strongshouldntstrong be at 200PM. p  pemHeres where I am lost, my only guess would be to build many, many schedules and then rank them based on the average waiting time a person has from one meeting to the nextemp  hr  pHowever My solutions I hesitate to call them that require too much brute force and would take too long to create. Are there simpler, more elegant solutionsp

Negative 68203 pFor an ios app Im writing, Id like to take an photo from the photo library and then let the user clean it up, essentially deleting parts of it that are not needed. For example, suppose the user chooses a photo of a person, my app only needs the head and everything else should be deleted so the user needs to clean the photo up by deleting the background, the body or other persons in the photo.  Imagine a photoshop like experience but with only one tool  the eraser. p  pIm looking for open source libraries, or examples or just tips of how to get started with that.  p  pI know how to use a UIImagePickerController to select an image so the missing part is the actual editing. As a complete noob Id be happy to get some advice on what would be a reasonable approach to this, preferably with some sample code or even a reusable library.   p  pI suppose, in a high level, what I want to do is start with a rectangular image and make sure it has an alpha layer and then as the user touches parts of the image to delete them, I need to delete more pixels from the image by changing their alpha level to 0.  But thats a too high level description which Im not even sure is correct... Another reasonable requirement is undo support.  p  pAnother approach that comes to mind is using the original image and a mask image which the user edits while touching the screen and when done, somehow compile the two images to one image with alpha.  Of course, this is an implementation detail and the user need not know that there are two images on the screen.p  pIf possible, Id like to stay at the UIImage or UIImageView or Core Graphics levels and not have to mess with OpenGL ES. My gut feeling is that the higher graphics levels should be performant enough and easy to understand, maintainable clean code is a consideration...p  pAny advice is appreciated, thanksp

Negative 68203 pIm analyzing a fellow developers SQL code and I could be totally wrong, but something theyve done doesnt seem good to me.p  pThe design is for a dynamic expression builder. The expressions are stored using a few tables and the system works. The aspect of the system that concerns me is that when the expression records are stored, a stored procedure is called that then creates a UDF that unrolls the entire expression as one function. p  pSo what that means is, for each unique expression created, there will be a unique UDF that can be ran that will execute that expression. Im assuming that this is being done so that the execution plan can be cached and performance will be increased, as opposed to building dynamic sql and running that each time.p  pWhat do you guys think, does it seem like an acceptable solution Do you need more infop
Negative 68203 pI am interested in making a web front end for my C Console Application it is ran on dedicated machines as a service so the user never sees the console allowing for control of various features. I have very little experience with ASP.net so I need to find out what the best approach would be for this.p  pRight now I have embedded this nice little web server into it httpwebserver.codeplex.com but I imagine doing a frontend with ASP.net would give a lot more control over the application. I have had very little luck with Google results as most of the searches pertain to ASP.net or Console Applications, but not using them together. I basically need to not only pull information from my application and display it, but allow user input as well mostly just text boxes and buttons.p  pThe other problem I ran into was it doesnt seem like any good solutions exist for embedding an ASP.net web server. I found a hrefhttpultidev.comproductscassini relnofollowUltiDev Cassinia and a hrefhttpcode.google.compaspnetserve relnofollowaspNETServea but neither seems like it can be embedded. Both look like they require additional software to be running, which is difficult since I just want to distribute a .exe file. Is it not possible to completely embed a ASP.net serverp

However, I think I may have found an simpler solution modifying your original code and using jQuery hoverIntentp  pI found out I could disable Supersized from stopping the slides changing during the animation and I can use hoverIntent to ensure that it waits enough time before changing the slide so the animations dont stack up.p  pThe following code works perfectly changing slides on mouseover.p  pBut I cant get mouseout to work because its creating a new instance of it for each button, and it stacks up the animations when the mouse rolls out of one button and onto the next.  Also there only seems to be a delayed timer for the mouseout and not an interval option like the mouseover.p  pSo I just need to modify this slightly so thatp  pstrongIf the mouse is not over ANY of the buttons for 1000 ms, then api.goTo1strongp  pThe only way I can think of would be to create an invisible  link the entire size of the browser window and run a second hoverIntent function to change the slide when it rolls over this, but I dont think that would be the best wayp  pThanksp  precodevar buttonNumber  ltphp echo projectcount gt Change this number to the number of buttons. var prefix  projectlink var prefix2  projectbullet  forvar i0 iltbuttonNumber i     functioni Anonymous function wrapper is needed to scope variable i       var id  prefixi        id.hoverIntent          interval 350,          over mouseyover,           timeout 1000,           out mouseyout               function mouseyover          api.goToi2          .projectbullet.fadeOut1          prefix2i.fadeIn1000               function mouseyout          api.goTo1           i  codepre

Negative 68203 pIm having a little trouble making my app bundle work from the terminal or just double clicking it.p  pThis App actually compiles, links and runs perfectly within the Qt Creator IDE. But, if I try to open it from the terminal I get a mediafile.x file not found error. The App bundle nor the ContentsMacOSexecutable is finding the media folder that is supposed to be beside the executable. p  pIn my app I do something likep  precodeopenFilemediafile.x codepre  pIn Windows and Linux, this file WILL be found if the media folder is exactly in the same hierarchical position of the executable beside it. On the Mac I have discovered it works differently cause Qt Creator builds an App Bundle and the actual executable is inside the ContentsMacOS folder, so I copied the media manually there. This worked without any hassle when playing my app from the Qt Creator but as mentioned before it doesnt work when running the bundle itself.p  pSo does anyone know where or how can I homogenize the look for this media folder so it works on both Qt Creator and the App bundlep  pLately, I have been using the following command to install the folder on the bundle.p  precodemac      MediaFiles.files  media     MediaFiles.path  ContentsMacOS     QMAKEBUNDLEDATA  MediaFiles  codepre  pThanks for your help.p

Reason for asking is that i The C compiler doesnt complain about the wrong structure size and ii The problem is very difficult to reproduce. Im right now having a hard time in making it crash in the old version where the size of the struct is wrong and I wanted to avoid following a possible deadend since each testing can take many days..p

Negative 68203 pI have a fairly simple Django application v1.3 on Red Hat for which Im using the admin application to create and modify database records. One of the fields in my underlying model is a date field. Each time the corresponding field is displayed in the admins new or edit form Id like the stronginitialstrong value of this field to be todays date and time. The user may choose to modify it thereafter, if she desires.p  pI know that I can set the strongdefaultstrong field value within my model definition i.e. in models.py. Which works fine when a database record is first created. But for subsequent invocations of the change form the callable that Ive assigned to the default parameter datetime.datetime.now obviously doesnt get invoked.p  pIve looked at  and tried  pretty well all of the many proposed solutions described elsewhere in stackoverflow, without success. Most of these appear to revolve around inserting initialisation code into the ModelForm subclass, e.g. either something like this...p  precodeclass ConstantDefAdminFormModelForm      adatefield  DateFieldinitialdatetime.datetime.now   or now     class Meta          model  ConstantDef         widgets               ...          codepre  por something like this...p  precodeclass ConstantDefAdminFormModelForm      class Meta          model  ConstantDef         widgets               ...          def initself, ...           some initialisation of adatefield         superConstantDefAdminForm, self.init... codepre  pBut neither of these approaches work. The initial field value is always set to the value that is stored in the database. My reading of the Django documentation is that the various ways of imposing initial field values in forms only work for strongunboundstrong forms, not strongboundstrong forms. Rightp  pBut this capability to selectively override currently stored values would seem to be such a popular requirement that Im convinced that there must be a way to do it.p  pHas anyone out there succeeded in doing thisp  pThanks in advance,p  pPhilp

Negative 68203 pFor educational purposes, Im writing a set of methods that cause runtime exceptions in C to understand what all the exceptions are and what causes them. Right now, Im tinkering with programs that cause an codeAccessViolationExceptioncode.p  pThe most obvious way to me to do this was to write to a protected memory location, like thisp  precodeSystem.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.WriteInt32IntPtr.Zero, 0 codepre  pJust as I had hoped, this threw an codeAccessViolationExceptioncode. I wanted to do it more concisely, so I decided to write a program with unsafe code, and do what I thought was exactly the same thing by assigning code0code to the zeropointer.p  precodeunsafe      int0  0  codepre  pFor reasons that elude me, this throws a codeNullReferenceExceptioncode. I played around with it some and found out that using codeint1code instead also throws a codeNullReferenceExceptioncode, but if you use a negative number, like codeint1code it will throw an codeAccessViolationExceptioncode.p  pWhats going on here Why does codeint0  0code cause a codeNullReferenceExceptioncode, and why doesnt it cause an codeAccessViolationExceptioncodep

Negative 68203 pSo I am working with MySQL workbench 5.2 and i am making an EER diagram for my database, and when I make a many to many relationship between a table and those tables already have relationships with other tables it creates a junction table with all of the other relationships in the two tables that you are joining.. my question is is it necessary to have all of those other keys cant you just have the primary key of the join table and then just the ids of the two tables you are relating to Or am I overlooking something p  phere is part of my DB p  precode    Table test.storyshascomments   CREATE  TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test.storyshascomments      storysid INT NOT NULL ,     storysuserid INT NOT NULL ,     commentsid INT NOT NULL ,     PRIMARY KEY storysid, storysuserid, commentsid ,     INDEX fkstoryshascommentscomments1 commentsid ASC ,     INDEX fkstoryshascommentsstorys1 storysid ASC, storysuserid ASC   ENGINE  MyISAM         Table test.storys      CREATE  TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test.storys       id INT NOT NULL ,      userid INT NOT NULL ,      catagoriesid INT NOT NULL ,      PRIMARY KEY id, userid, catagoriesid ,      INDEX fkstorysuser userid ASC ,      INDEX fkstoryscatagories1 catagoriesid ASC    ENGINE  MyISAM     Table test.comments    CREATE  TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test.comments     id INT NOT NULL ,    body TINYTEXT NULL ,    PRIMARY KEY id  ENGINE  MyISAM codepre  pso as you can see in the story table it has foreign keys to multiple things even though it only links to two tables. p
Negative 68203 pI have searched quite a bit on google but cant seem to find any clear answer. Under normal circumstances, a training set of size M x N will be of the form X i, Y i, 1 lt i lt M, where Xi represents a particular row of data with N input features or dimensions. However, suppose I have Xi in the form of N x L a 2d table. Hence, X has dimensions M x N x L element of RMxNxL.  How should I approach this I hope Im making sense herep  pCurrently, Im attempting to take the N values in each of the N x L table form datas in Xi and trying to map it to some set of unique numbers that represents the N values standard deviation, mean or etc. This changes the size of X from M x N x L to M x L or M x 2L dimensions and allows me to classify accordingly. Currently, Im using a NN implementation will be looking into SVMS in the upcoming weeks.p  pAny suggestions to this particular issue each training data in 2D tableformat to improve my learning algorithm will be greatly appreciated.p  pEdit Let me be more specific to my data. Suppose I have 15 fields L and 200 N different readings of those fields at different times or distance. For example, consider a problem where a person walks through a detector with 15 different sensors for 200 seconds. Hence, each row of data in N x L table corresponds to the data taken at each second. Hence, often times, there is a bell curve for N values at any given field, with increasing time. Moreover, each rowin NxL is conditionally dependent. The classification is done on the person.p  pIf someone can describe to me a psudoalgorithm in words not just the names to approach this issue, that would be fantastic. p

Negative 68203 pSome time ago, Ive got a new single board computer running Debian which will eventually be the heart of a project at school.p  pRight now, Im accessing the onboard distro using wired network and ssh. This is fine as long as the thing lies on my desktop, but not when it is built into the robot to where it is targeted. I managed to establish a bluetooth connection using a cheap USBBT adapter, but now Im stuck with an rfcomm device and no clue on how to proceed.p  pWhat I would like most would be to have the virtual serial port provided by the bluetooth connection to behave just like the real serial port. So that I can log in using minicom or something similar and get full access to everything on the board.p  pWhen searching the web, all I could find were guides about how to set up dialup networking with mobiles and similar topics, but nothing about a bluetooth console. Maybe Ive just tried the wrong keywords.p  pId really much appreciate any hint on how to do this.p  pThanks, Philippp

I feel like theres still something I didnt understand. So...p  pstrongHow do I define a general theme for ListViews so the pressed color of the TextViews is white instead blackstrongp  hr  pstrongEditstrongp  pAfter some reading I came to the conclusion that it is impossible to achieve that the way I describe. You can set codetextColorcode globally in codeMyThemecode but then it affects all TextViews. Or you create an own list item layout which behaves the right way. But you cant modify the default android list item with a theme definition. That seems to be logical if I think about it again... A TextView should check if it is nested in a ListView otherwise and that will never happen.p

Negative 68203 pIve been doing some reading on the fascinating subject of DNS, specifically the zone apex CNAME issue associated with Heroku and other cloud hosting platforms. Since Heroku strongly suggests never using A Records, whats the best way to use a second level domain with my Heroku appp  pI found that certain paid DNS services like DNSimple that offer an alias record type A Record masquerading as a CNAME that allows you to map your second level domain to yourapp.herokuapp.com in an RFC compliant way. Unfortunately, Im currently stuck with registrar DNS.p  pI did also try CNAMEing a www subdomain as Heroku suggests, but there seems to be no ideal way to accomodate user typed urls with no www. The redirection service that my registrar 1and1 provides works, but paths are not preserved.

Negative 68203 pI am working on a Django 1.3.1 website which is highly dynamic by nature. On many pages certain elements have to be refreshed each 1020 seconds. We use AJAX requests for this.p  pNow, on the backend side each AJAX is handled by executing a DB query or possibly from cache I expect 95 times its going to be from cache. We are thinking to change the method to instead put the updates to some files served by the web server. Then instead of hitting Django, AJAX would be handled by just serving the file. Backend would take care of updating the files if its necessary those files are very small a couple of numbers.p  pHave anyone tried something like this What possible drawbacks can you see arising for instance from concurrent readwrite file access Is it likely to gain some performance from this approachp

Negative 68203 pSo far, reflection seems to be the only way to strongdynamicallystrong check if two objects are the same.  You would do this by iterating through the objects members and checking for which ones contain a different value.  However, research has told me that reflection is bad on performance when used this way.p  pIf someone can confirm here whether or not reflection is indeed not a good choice for what I need to do, perhaps there is an alternativep  pNote that, whatever route I go, I need the solution to be dynamic.  This means no overriding of Equals and then comparing each property one by one.  If its dynamic, I can write one method that will work for all types.p

Negative 68203 pI am building a project using wxWidgets compiled with MinGW g compiler. I was also using a component of the wxWidgets platform to play mp3 sound clips, but it has been unreliable so I went looking for another solution.

Negative 68203 pIm reading a long article about Data Stream Management, and Im a bit confused by the difference between Sliding and Tumbling Windows. So far Ive understood that tumbling windows can be timebased and has fixed start,endpoints which tumbles when that window expires. E.g. A timebased window can be 1 minute long. So for every minute the window tumbles to process aggregations for a data set. p  pIt is sliding windows that gets confused me. Is sliding windows like countbased such that a window tumbles when xnumber of tuples have entered the window. Or is it that the xrecent tuples that entered the window will be part of the window, and that the older tuples will be evicted from that window. I.e. a window that is continuously updated as new tuples arrives p

Negative 68203 pgcc has a useful flag codeWconversioncode that produces a warning when theres an implicit conversion from a wider to a narrower type, potentially losing information. Unfortunately, it has the following ... unhelpful ... behaviour.p  hr  pConsider this programp  precodeint mainvoid    short x  1   x  xx   return 0  codepre  pCompiling this with Wconversion producesp  precodenonsense.c In function main nonsense.c38 warning conversion to short int from int may alter its value [Wconversion] codepre  pwhich is fair enough on most platforms this will do something you might not expect if it happens that codex0x8000code. The actual mechanism by which you get this warning the operands to codecode are subject to the usual arithmetic conversions, which widens them to int so the result is also of type int then assigning back to codexcode is an implicit conversion from a wider to a narrower type. But suppose you emdoem expect and intend this behaviour. Youre simulating a 16bit processor, or a 16bit shift register or you know the range of possible values of codexcode in this code and itll never overflow. You can tell the compiler by putting in an explicit castp  precodeint mainvoid    short x  1   x  shortxx   return 0  codepre  pand it then wont complain.p  hr  pSo far, so good. But if the assignment thats causing the trouble is a compound assignment  codecode, codecode, codeltltcode, etc.  then so far as I can see there is emno way to get rid of this warningem because there isnt any point in the code at which you could insert the explicit cast.p  pThis means, for instance, that you cant have all ofp  ul liWconversion in your projects toplevel compiler flags, to catch all the real mistakes its intended for.li liAny instance anywhere in the code of compound assignment operators applied to integral types shorter than codeintcode.li liA warningfree build.li ul  pwhich seems sad.p  hr  pSo, the question strongis there a good way to work around thisstrong I can see the following waysp  ul liUse codepragma GCC diagnostic ...code to disable the warning in bits of code that are known to provoke it despite not having bugs. emDownsideem ugly, compilerspecific.li liExpand compound assignments into longer single assignments and insert explicit casts. emDownsideem superugly.li liTurn off codeWconversioncode. emDownsideem This warning is useful elsewhere.li liPut up with the warnings. emDownsideem Incompatible with using codeWerrorcode in any case its good practice to make your code compile with no warnings at all, because the difference between no warnings and some warnings is easier to spot than the difference between some warnings and some more warnings.li ul  pAll of these seem unsatisfactory, and Im wondering whether theres something cleverer that Im missing.p  pNote of course I will accept a no, thats it answer if thats actually the truth.p  hr  pSo, it looks as if the answer is that this really is the intended behaviour and there is no way to stop it thats much better than the ones listed above.

So, I assume its a problem with the actual code in RichTextBox. Anyone have any ideasp  pI can post more of my code if anyone needs it but the situation really is pretty basic.

Negative 68203 pIm working on a PHPMySQL application that must be HIPAA compliant. From what Ive read, any personal data that may identify someone or any medical information must be 256bit encrypted both at rest and in transit. Im trying to figure out what the most efficient approach to this is.p  pI am using Amazon Web Services and I thought of using SSL encryption for both HTTP and database requests to protect data in transit. As for data at rest, I thought of compiling a custom MySQL server with AES 256 in order to use AESENCRYPT and AESDECRYPT  but would I then have to store an IV for each field I encrypt Otherwise, doing encryptiondecryption within the application itself would take too long and querying the database would be hell. p  pAny thoughtsp
Negative 68203 pAs I look at the standard for different STL objects and functions, one thing that doesnt make sense to me is why would the begin and end functions for container objects return an iterator by value rather than by constant reference It seems to me that iterators could be held by the container object internally and adjusted whenever the container is mutated. This would mitigate the cost of creating unnecessary temporaries in for loops like thisp  precodefor stdvectorltintgtiterator itmyvec.begin itmyvec.end it     do things  codepre  pIs this a valid concern Is there something about using references to iterators that makes this a bad idea Do most compiler implementations optimize this concern away anywayp

Sometimes a dynamic change on a ListView row layout affects other rows too, sometimes it does not. p  pAs a solution to this problem I usually keep track of the whole set of items in the list and every time I have a change, I reset all items on the list.p  pEx If i have a list with TextViews and checkboxes, i have to keep an array of booleans indicating the state of each checkbox, and on my getView override I reset all the checkboxes based on that array.p  pIs this expected I can find several questions about this issue, and all the solutions seems to be similar to mine. p  pNow im facing an issue where I need to keep track of several items at once Background, checkbox and text in a really long list.

Obviously, we dont want current users who paid for the app functionality to be charged again in the InApp purchase for functionality they already had.  So on the update by the user, we want to 1 identify current users and 2 make it so they dont see the InApp purchase in the first place, sort of faking the InApp purchase so that the app will appear to them exactly as it did before.p  pThe app does not have a backend, so we have to determine current users from new by examining the saved user data fields for certain values.  I do understand that if a previous user has deleted the app from their device that nothing can be done, and I dont mind charging them for the InApp purchase, since they never used the app anyway.p  pBut for those current users who update and assuming we can examine the saved user data and determine that they are current users, what would be a good way to bypass the InApp purchase and make the app look like they already got it, when in fact they never paid for it  Thanks p

Negative 68203 pI am trying to work around this issue since few days now. I have a hybrid OpenMPI  Pthreads program. This means, the program runs on multiple machines such that each machine runs a set of pthreads. p  pTo simplify the problem, let us assume there are 3 machines and each is running 2 pthreads P1 and P2. Now, P1 on each machine continuously communicates with P1 on other machines using MPISendRecv. Simultaneously, P2 does some work and regularly calls MPIBarrier to synchronize with P2 on other machines. This fails the MPISendRecv methods and the program crashes with random errors like connection reset by peer  bad file descriptor  tcp errors  etc.p  ol liIf I comment out MPIBarrier from P2, everything works fine. li liIf I comment out MPISendRecv from P1, everything works fine.li liIf both MPIBarrier in P2 and MPISendRecv in P1 are left uncommented, the program crashes.li ol  pHence, the only reason I could think of is that MPIBarrier and MPISendRecv are affecting each other at underlying communication levels.p  pHowever, I do need communication like MPISendRecv in P1 and synchronization like MPIBarrier in P2 to maintain semantic correctness. And I need them simultaneously which means I do not want to pause communication before hitting the synchronization point and then continue the communication fro where it had left. p  pIs there a way to do thisp

Negative 68203 pI am now developing an image binarization library, and in this library classical binarization methods such as Sauvola and Otsu method will be implemented.

When we use codeBinarizationcode class, we can denote the method we want to employ by invoking the codesetcode method. However, ad different binarization methods may have different parameter setting, the structure of codeBinarizationparacodewill become complicated. p  pSolution 2p  precodeclass BinarizationMethod1    public     performbinarizationImage pin, Image pout, BinarizationMethod1Para amppara   class BinarizationMethod2    public     performbinarizationImage pin, Image pout, BinarizationMethod2Para amppara  codepre  pMy question is which one is better.

Negative 68203 pI currently have an application in which I am getting a long string of jpgs in as a string. I would like to break this string into individual files, but I cant find any clear way to recognize EOFs from within Python. I imagine this is a fairly common problem, but I havent been able to find a solution for this. The string should only be about 2030 jpgs long, so its pretty small, but Im not sure how to recognize EOFs as I go through the string.p  pI tried just splitting on code0code, but it seems that this does not quite indicate EOF for these jpgs. p

Negative 68203 pIm developing a C application under linux that receives a raw h.264 stream and should visualize this stream using gstreamer APIs. I am a newbie with GStreamer so maybe I am doing huge stupid mistakes or ignoring wellknown stuff, sorry about that.p  pI got a raw h264 video I knew it was the exact same format I need and developed an application that plays it. It correctly works with appsrc in pull mode when need data is called, I get new data from the file and perform pushbuffer.p  pNow Im trying to do the exact same thing but in push mode, this is basically because I dont have a video, but a stream. So I have a method inside my code that will be called every time new data in the form of an codeuint8tcode buffer arrives, and this is my video source.p  pI googled my problem and had a look at the a hrefhttpgstreamer.freedesktop.orgdatadocgstreamerheadgstpluginsbaselibshtmlgstpluginsbaselibsappsrc.html relnofollowdocumentationa, but I found no simple code snippets for my use case, even if it seems a very simple one. I understood that I have to init the pipeline and appsrc and then only pushbuffer when I have new data. p  pWell, I developed two methods codeinitstreamcode for pipelineappsrc initialization and codepopulateappvoid  inBuf,  sizet lencode to send data when they are available.

However, I need to keep the space between UIImageView blocks fixed, as a result of which it looks cramped up in portrait and fine in landscape.

Negative 68203 pI am trying to understand how licensing works for Petrel amp Ocean. If a company needs to develop its own custom pluginsmodules, does it need to buy explicit Ocean SDK license or just with Petrel runtime license, they can do development I do understand that Ocean SDK brings along with it help CHMs, few samples plus VS project wizards for Ocean but in my understanding, thats something which is not mandatorily needed to do plugin development as SLB Ocean assemblies are part of Petrel installation. So if one has only Petrel runtime license, can they legally do development, deployment, runtime etc for their pluginp  pOr is it that Petrel runtime license cost inherently contains the cost of Ocean SDK license as well If thats the case, then for a plugin development company to do full plugin lifecycle development, deployment, testing, can they only buy Ocean SDK license and still be able to do it all without core Petrel license Assuming tainting of projects is not an issue....p  pThanks, Mp

The POST request needs to be multipartformdata encoded and contain a file field. cUrl example curl F filesomefile.rar https6.baycdn.comupload93b37e574e691e0c60XProgressID4e639fcd34CC2F73796CF81679C605643A8F99CF Note in order to upload a file to your account, you need to first log in using accountlogin and then append sessionXYZ to fileuploadUrl On success, the uploadUrl will respond with an object  error , fileId ltstringgt, size ltintgt, sha1 ltstringgt, infoToken ltstringgt, deleteToken ltstringgt, linksUrl ltstringgt, downloadUrl ltstringgt, deleteUrl ltstringgt,  codepre  pThe code i have onClickp  precodecase R.id.upload             asyncTask  new JsonAsync             asyncTask.setJsonListenernew JsonListener                  public void onObjectReturnJSONObject object                      handleJsonObjectobject                                           asyncTask.executehttpapi.bayfiles.netv1fileuploadUrlsession  sessionId             return true codepre  phandleJsonObjectp  precode private void handleJsonObjectJSONObject object           try              sUpload  object.getStringuploadUrl                         HttpClient httpclient  new DefaultHttpClient              post request to send the video               File sdCardRoot  Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory             File myDir  new FilesdCardRoot, Download              HttpPost httppost  new HttpPostsUpload             StrictMode.ThreadPolicy policy  new StrictMode.ThreadPolicy.Builder.permitAll.build             StrictMode.setThreadPolicy policy             FileBody videofile1  new FileBodynew FilemyDir  test.txt             MultipartEntity reqEntity  new MultipartEntity             reqEntity.addPartfiletest.txt, videofile1                                 httppost.setEntityreqEntity               DEBUG             System.out.println executing request   httppost.getRequestLine               HttpResponse response  null             try                  response  httpclient.execute httppost               catch ClientProtocolException e                   TODO Autogenerated catch block                 e.printStackTrace              catch IOException e                   TODO Autogenerated catch block                 e.printStackTrace                          HttpEntity resEntity  response.getEntity                DEBUG             System.out.println response.getStatusLine               if resEntity  null                try                  System.out.println EntityUtils.toString resEntity                catch org.apache.http.ParseException e                   TODO Autogenerated catch block                 e.printStackTrace              catch IOException e                   TODO Autogenerated catch block                 e.printStackTrace                            end if             if resEntity  null                try                  resEntity.consumeContent               catch IOException e                   TODO Autogenerated catch block                 e.printStackTrace                            end if              httpclient.getConnectionManager .shutdown             catch JSONException e              Log.elogtag, Error parsing data   e.toString             Crouton.makeTextthis, Something went wrong, Style.ALERT.show               codepre  pThe error i get from server JSON is error file creation failesp  pAnd the logcatp  precode1014 131729.954 ISystem.out22705 executing request POST https5.baycdn.comupload199808fb5261511572084659XProgressID525bd2d5566FC893A0505FABB493A4215C7EC3AF HTTP1.1 1014 131731.125 ISystem.out22705 HTTP1.1 200 OK 1014 131731.125 ISystem.out22705 errorfile creation failed codepre
Negative 68203 pSay I have two nodes Body Temperature and Fever , The relationship between them has name causes and property as degree Celsius has value 102.0 .

Negative 68203 pI am no guru when it comes to CSS and I wanted to create a web page layout using CSS only if possible. The layout that I would like is to have two divs, one containing a banner and the other containing the content of the page with the banner to the left of the content. So far easy enough. The banner div contains two subdivs, one containing the title of the page and the other containing some extra information such as contact information. Once again, not too hard.p  pThe problem arises when I want the text displayed in the title to be vertical, reading from bottom to top. I did some searching around on the web and found the CSS3 transform rotate functionality which does what I want it to do.p  precodename    border solid 1px black   backgroundcolor yellow   height 50px   font normal normal bold 40px Helvetica, Arial, sansserif   padding 10px   webkittransformorigin left bottom   webkittransform rotate270deg   moztransformorigin left bottom   moztransform rotate270deg   mstransformorigin left bottom   mstransform rotate270deg   otransformorigin left bottom   otransform rotate270deg   transformorigin left bottom   transform rotate270deg  codepre  pUnfortunately, when it comes to rendering the text in the browser, the space reserved by the browser for the rotated text is the width of the banner text before it was rotated, and not the width of the text after rotation i.e. the height of the banner text before rotation. Hence my content div is sitting way out on the page when I would like it to be right next to my banner div.p  pTo see what I mean, check out this a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netUDfZE1 relnofollowJSFiddlea.p  pHow do I get the two divs to live side by sidep  pThis doesnt havent to be a purely CSS solution as I think I may have to use JavaScriptjQuery to calculate widths and heights etc. and then move the banner div accordingly, but a pure CSS solution would be nifty.p

Negative 68203 pI have a codesimpleoneforonecode supervisor that manages a fairly volatile set of children  they often die due to external causes, e.g. their network conn being terminated. Erlangs supervision system is brilliant for this  it just restarts them back up and everything rolls on.p  pThe problem occurs when one of the children has a serious problem with the connection and hits the supervisors max restart limit, at which point the supervisor kills all children, and then kills itself. Awesome, this is specified in the documentation. However, my ideal behavior would be for the supervisor to give up restarting that particular child, and continue.p  pI know I can implement this using separate processes which monitors the supervisor, but this seems like overkill.p  pThanks for any ideasp

Negative 68203 pstrongThe Purposestrongp  pI have an assignment that involves a race between a tortoise and a hare. Basically, I have two .gif files, one of a tortoise and one of a hare, that are to be displayed in an applet and race each other by advancing along the x axis. In the process, I must use a random number generator to generate different moves in which the animal image file moves forward or backwards a certain number of positions. This loop must be repeated until one of the animals reach the 50th position. There also must be a time delay of some sort in between each move that the two animals make.p  pstrongThe Codestrongp  precodeimport java.util.Random import java.awt.Graphics import java.applet.Applet

tortoise and the hare show up in their appropriate places, but do not move.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pI want the tortoise and the hare to advance their positions according to a timer, but after compiling the code and launching the applet, due to some kind of mistake in my code, they do not.p  pstrongWhat I Think Might Be Wrongstrongp  pI believe the problem might have to do with how I implemented the delay, my using an element in an array as the x value for the images, or conflicting variables in my dowhile loop andor my case statement, although I do not know what is wrong nor what I should fix. However, I now realize that if the program does work, due to my use of randoms.length as a constructor in my for loop near the top, the tortoise and the hare will only change positions 50 times before stopping no matter what. I dont know how to fix this problem either.p  pstrongAdditional Informationstrongp  ul lipHere is a chart on how far the animals should move according to the random number chosenp  blockquote   p12  Tortoise moves 3 positions, Hare moves  9p      p35  Tortoise moves 3 positions, Hare moves 1p      p6  Tortoise moves 1 position, Hare moves back 12p      p78  Tortoise moves 1 position, Hare moves back 2p      p910  Tortoise moves back 6 positions, Hare does not move at allp blockquoteli lipAn animal can move no farther back than the original position positions[0]. If the number goes below, the animal must stay at that position.

Negative 68203 pIm using Codeception to create api tests for some REST APIs. Im finding that the Page Objects are really helpful in writing my tests but should I be using another Codeception objectp  pFor example, Im putting User information first name, last name, user ID ... into a UsersPage Page Object class but it is bothering me that it is named Users strongPagestrong when it is not representing a page. Is there another Codeception Object I should be using to represent reusable information Im using in the testsp

Negative 68203 pI am testing the SAPUI5 framework with a little todo list application. I have a database and access the data through a REST Service. I am able to get everything into my UI and from the UI into the database. p  pHowever, i am saving a reference of the database data in an JSON model which is mapped to a Table i am showing on the UI. When i try to adddelete elements, the writing to the database seem to work correctly but my intern model variable loses its reference between the different function calls initToDoModel and addToDo for example.

Then when i click the Add Button on my page the addToDo function is called and needs to update the cached JSONModel which is undefined by this time.p  pI am new to JavaScript so maybe someone could explain what is happening there.p

Negative 68203 pExcuse me, I have a question please.p  pI want to create a service to start once the the device is up and running by extending BroadcastReceiver. Inside the service class, I want to initiate an alarm manager to display a notification after certain time. Then, once the time is elapsed the notification is displayed, the alarm manger should be rescheduled for the next specified time. How could achieve that as alarm manager set function requires pending intent where no pending intent is required as I am inside a service class. I insist on using alarm manager instead of Timer as the following link suggests using it a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8038967whichisbetterforabackgroundservicewakelockorstartforegroundWhich is better for a background service WakeLock or startForegroundap  pThe codep  precodepublic class BootCompletedReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver       final static String TAG  BootCompletedReceiver      Override     public void onReceiveContext context, Intent arg1          Log.wTAG, starting service...         context.startServicenew Intentcontext, BookkeeperService.class       codepre  hr  precodeimport android.app.AlarmManager import android.app.Notification import android.app.Service import android.content.Intent import android.os.IBinder import android.os.PowerManager  public class BookkeeperService extends Service      AlarmManager alarmManager      Override     public void onCreate         super.onCreate          alarmManager  AlarmManagergetSystemServiceALARMSERVICE          here I need to set the alarm to notify the user after certain time and then reschedule           to the next event           Override     public int onStartCommandIntent intent, int flags, int startId          super.onStartCommandintent, flags, startId          return STARTNOTSTICKY           Override     public IBinder onBindIntent intent          return null       codepre  pThank youp

Negative 68203 pI have a couple CascadingDropDown Lists, which are working properly. What I cant figure out is how to prepopulate the dropdownlists until a parent selection is made.p  pHeres an examplep  pLets say I have two CascadingDropDowns 1 Country 2 Statep  pWhen a user selects a country, the state dropdownlist is enabled and populated using the CascadingDropDown webservice. In this scenario, a user must select a Country to select State. Until a Country is selected, the state cascadingdropdown is disabled I tried the EnableAtLoading but it failed to load any values in State. I want to populate the State DropDown with every state in the database until a Country is selected. At that time, the State list is set to those states associated with the selected country. I hope this makes sense.p  pAssume that the query to populate the state ddl with every state is p  precodeSELECT DISTINCT state FROM location codepre  pSo, what I want to do is Populate the state dropdownlist with every state until a country is selected. At that time, the state ddl is reset to only those associated with the selected country in the parent allowing the CascadingDropDown extender to override the dropdownlist data binding the standard procedure with ccdsp  pHow is this donep

Negative 68203 pI have written a controller to deal with video upload. The hard part for me is to convert the video type to both mp4 and webm. I chose to new a thread in my controller and the thread will new a process which is a video convert software called ffmpeg. p  pThe problem is that this thread will occupy too much resourcesat least 25 CPU usage. So I guess I have to make these threads created by different controller instances execute in a shared queue. It is terrible to have these threads in concurrent execution.p  pIt seems that the taskExecutor in Spring can only manage threads created by one controller instance.

Negative 68203 pNoob question. I have a project with a selfhosted Web Api.

How does the page get these embedded resourcesp  pAs I understand it, codehttplocalhost8080apihomecode in the browser causes the project to call the page at codeViewsHome.htmlcode and pass through the codeValuecode object. This results in HTML appearing in the browser rather than the usual JSONXML that you normally get with WebAPi.p  pFor the page to retrieve the embedded javascript, I guess I would create another WebApi controller that would respond to the URL, but how do I get it to transmit the javascript page Ie how do I get it to look in a folder called Scripts and not Views, not attempt to convert to HTML, and not bother with an associated modelp  precodepublic class HomeController  ApiController       httplocalhost8080apihome     public Value GetValues              return new Value  Numbers  new int[]  1, 2, 3           [ViewHome]      public class Value      public int[] Numbers  get set   codepre  phome.cshtml...p  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt      ltscript srcScriptsscript1.jsgtltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt      ltimg srcImagesimage1.pnggt     .... ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 68203 pI have a background worker with the task of downloading large numbers of small files and saving them on the hard disk. To give you an idea of scale, 30 million files.p  pThe background worker is cancellable and I can cancel just fine once I begin downloading the files. But I cant cancel during the call to the external dll method which tells me what files to download. I have an external dll with a method I call which returns this long list of files. It can take hours to complete just that one single method.p  pI really need to be able to cancel this call. For example, the user gets frustrated with the time its taking and hits cancel.

Negative 68203 pI wrote an Android app to display fullscreen YUV layer through a fullscreen video playing using VideoView Component. Only the video playing window can be seen on the screen, I thought there should be only one underlying layer. But using dumpsys SurfaceFlinger shell command can see 2 layers one is SurfaceViewYUV format and another is a RGB layer. p  pMy questions are p  p1 why is there a RGB layer p  p2 How to generate only one underlying YUV layer on Androidp
Negative 68203 pIm trying to build the Boost C libraries in 32bit form on a 64bit linux machine. After running bootstrap.sh, I runp  precode.b2 addressmodel32 codepre  pAll I get as output is a load of g output saying compilation terminated. and a result of no libraries compiled, all skipped. This is extremely frustrating for me as I cant find anyone else who is having the same issue. All answers seem to point to using the addressmodel32 option which doesnt work at all for me.p  pIf i specify no options and just runp  precode.b2 codepre  pThen all is well and the build is successful. But surly this builds 64bit libraries Which is not what I want when my target is 32bit systems.p  pIm using Ubuntu 13.10 64bit and trying to build Boost 1.55.0.p  pAny help is appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 68203 pI am developing an android app which does a long running task either invoked by user or scheduled by Alarm. p  pI have designed it in Activity   Service   AsyncTask form of invocation.p  pI use the Otto library to bring UI updates directly from the AsyncTask to the activity.p  pI have two questionbr 1 Is there a reason I should use Otto to do the communication from AsyncTask   Service and then from Service   Activity. I have seen lots of apps use this pattern.p  p2 When should I run the service in foreground  The argument of not being killed by low memory can be abused. I want to make a conscious decision. I believe it should run in foreground when invoked by user manually and not when kicked by Alarm. p

Negative 68203 pHere is my simpllifed domain modelp  precodepublic abstract class AbstractClass      public string Name getset      public abstract IEnumerableltAbstractClassgt Children  get    public abstract class Project  AbstractClass      ListltDocumentgt Documents getset     public override IEnumerableltAbstractClassgt Children              get  return this.Documents         public abstract class Document  AbstractClass      misc  codepre  pI recently added the above abstract Children property and the assocated override in the Project class.  This was done because I need a reference to Children for user interface purposes other classes inheriting from AbstractClass also will have Children navigation property.p  pThe problem is that, now, when I retrieve the graph of ProjectsDocuments, duplicate documents are shown in the object graph.  Im thinking I need some sort of clone method here, but speed is important and I just wanted to reference the existing Documents navigation property rather than cloning the object.p  pI think there is a simple solution to this but it escapes me.p  pThanks.p  pEditp  pFor clarity, I am retrieving the data from a SQL database via a Web Api and the problem occurs after the Web Api send the result message back to the client.  So it looks like the Children property may be causing the problem perhaps at the deserialization stage.p

First map will have the username key and the second the id key. As value they both will have a pointer to the proper Pack object.  p  pAlso, I forgot to mention one important thing.

Negative 68203 pIm getting little desperate here. I have this page with the contain sized background images and since its responsive design, there are relatively sized and positioned bubbles around the layout containing images and headings try to resize the browser window to see why is everything positioned and sized that way. Image is visible by default, heading is visible on hovertouch.

The problem is that the IE 9 to 11 reproduces the heading next to the parent, height is aok the width however, is not. Every other browser works fine.

Negative 68203 pI am trying to solve some classification problem. It seems many classical approaches follow a similar paradigm. That is, train a model with some training set and than use it to predict the class labels for new instances.p  pI am wondering if it is possible to introduce some feedback mechanism into the paradigm. In control theory, introducing a feedback loop is an effective way to improve system performance.p  pCurrently a straight forward approach on my mind is, first we start with a initial set of instances and train a model with them. Then each time the model makes a wrong prediction, we add the wrong instance into the training set. This is different from blindly enlarge the training set because it is more targeting. This can be seen as some kind of strongnegative feedbackstrong in the language of control theory.p  pIs there any research going on with the feedback approach Could anyone shed some lightp
Negative 68203 pI want to register all classes that implements a specific interface into Unity with the WithMappings.FromMatchingInterface convention.  In addition, I want all of the registered objects to be intercepted using an interface interception behaviour.  The problem is that Unity also register mappings between the concrete classes, and when those classes are resolved, an exception with message [type] is not interceptable is thrown.p  pI realise that resolving an object using the concrete class type is not best practice but I wonder why Unity automatically adds mappings for both interface  concrete class as well as concrete class  concrete class when registering by convention  This means that it will never work if you add an interface interceptor and resolve using the concrete type.p  pMy desired outcome for this would be that Unity did not add the concrete type  concrete type mappings when registering by convention and giving it an interface interceptor, that way we could resolve the class using its concrete type if we wanted to, we would just not get interception.p  pI do not want to use the VirtualMethodInterceptor as I do not want to impose changes to the classes in order for interception to work, this includes inheriting from MarshalByRef.  I also want to avoid individually registering all the objects.p  pMy questions is thus, how do I register just the interface mappings when registering by conventionp  pstrongUpdatestrong  registering the classes individually gives the same problem, so the assumption is therefore that once an object is registered with an interfaceinterceptor then it cannot be resolved by using the concrete type.p  pThe new registration codep  precodecontainer.RegisterTypeltISomeService, SomeServicegtnew InjectionMember[]                              new InterceptorltInterfaceInterceptorgt,                  new InterceptionBehaviorltTraceInterceptorgt                      container.RegisterTypeltISomeRepository, SomeRepositorygtnew InjectionMember[]                              new InterceptorltInterfaceInterceptorgt,                  new InterceptionBehaviorltTraceInterceptorgt              codepre  pstrongUpdate 2strong Adding a default interceptor for all the interfaces seems to work although this solution is rather hacky.

I am following the book Lucene in Action and wondering can anyone help me how to approach this problem.. p  pBased on my understanding of Index, there are a few attributes in the schema.xml... index or not store or not.... I assume, Whatever you want to include in the query result, it should be stored.  .. In that case, I have to store the column which contains the raw HTML... p  pSince that column is so big one record is usually about hundreds of KB... with only hundreds of rows.. you can easily get a dataset of almost 1GB... which wont work in solr and I am trying to index those columns using Lucene and it run into the heapsize problem.. p  pHere is another idea Maybe I should store the parsedfield1, parsedfield2 and pointer... where point column is the absolute path of the raw HTML file. Of course, in this case, I need to store each html into a separate file locallyor on HDFS...  So when user search for parsedfield1, it will return the absolute path and I go and retrieve those files...p  pI think I am describing the problem as clearly as I can and wondering can anyone spend a minute giving me some directional guidance... p  pMuch appreciatedp

Negative 68203 pI have an URL that will allow me to filter a list of courses.  This is the format of the URL  p  pstrongwww.xxxxxfilterAllCourseLanguagesAllAllAllAllhoursAllAllAllAnyone1strongp  pBy this url I want the list of courses that have codeCoursecode as codetypecode , codeLanguagescode as codeCategorycode  and their codedurationcode is  in codehourscodep  pThis is the URL of the client app written  with codeAngular.jscode. What I do is read the params in the url and make a call to a webservice that will get me the list of courses with the given critters.p  pThis URL is ugly since it contains a lot of All wildcards the client did not like it  . p  pI want to remove the All keyword. The problem that I face is that  I will no longer Know which keyword is relative to which type of filter. The second problem is that this url could be sent to another person  another browser  and I should get the same result as in the first browser.p  pstrongThe solution That I seestronghope its not the unique one making the filter as key value the url will be like this p  pstrongfilterTypeCourseCategoryLanguage....strong p  pThis is good in small number of filters but very long in case of big number of filters I have 12. the ideal solution is  having an URL like this p  pstrongfilterCourseLanguage....strong p  pAny clue how I could achieve this  p

Negative 68203 pemThe biggest problem is that I even dont really know how to describe the problem Im asking about. Its the first time in more then a decade of wed development.em p  pIm working on a Rails 4.1.1 app and using angularjs pretty extensively, though I dont know it well yet. And everything seemed to be working fine up to the moment when I tried to add some browser history manipulation to my app e.g. changing the displayed url when listing though a paginated list so that that url can be copied and distributed. To do this I added a config to my app.p  precodeapp.config locationProvider gt   locationProvider.html5Modetrue codepre  pAnd then in my angular controller added the location binding like thisp  precodescope.watch pagination.cur, newVal gt   scope.loadNews newVal   location.pathnews.searchpagenewVal codepre  pthis is ment to change the url in the browser searchbox when the user goes from one page to another.p  pThat workes well, the url does change appropriately, but all the sudden strongall the html links on the page got brokenstrong. I mean litteraly. I click any link on the page even outside the controller div, the url in the serchbox changes appropriately, but the turbolinks toes not fire the Ajax request to get the new page content. If I then refresh the page, it loads the correct page. p  pI know its really weird. Whats weirder, that I dont get any JavaScript errors or anything unusual.  The only way I found to get the links working again  is to remove that initial config.br But when I do it, the location falls back to hashtag syntax, wich is really not at all what I want.p  pMy only assumption is that there could be some kind of a conflict between angular location service and turbolinks when handling browser history, but even if thats right, I have no idea how to get around it. And I really need that kind of manipulation, cause Im going to be using it alot in this and other apps. p  pemI really dont know, what other information on this problem may be usefull, dont hasitate to ask for updates. Ill post whatever I can.emp  pP.S. Btw, can this kind of manipulation be done by means of turbolinks Cause its exactly the same thing turbolinks does when changing the displayed url after page body reload, but I cant find any documentation on its public API for that.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  ol lipHave no idea whats the source of the problem yet, but it seems to be not related to the turbolinks gem. Removing turbolinks requirements from the application.js file does not change anything.pli lipUsing window.history.pushState instead of location.path solves the functionality problem, but does not explain the initial bug.pli ol

However when I open only file 1 copied somewhere far from 2amp3 there is no data in my database, so I suppouse something isnt working ok.p  pThe problem is visible only on the device not on the simulator and only if you copy .sqlite to your computer from app data. If you copy all 3 files you can see all the records, but it suggest that everything is saved in cache instead of sqlite.p  pMaybe I should exchange code[Object MRcreateEntity]code to code[Object MRcreateInContextcontext]code because the object is created but not inserted into persistent storep

Negative 68203 pI was given a working Eclipse project in Java. If I open it in some version of Eclipse then I get numerous errors.

Negative 68203 pI wrote this SOR solver code. Dont bother too much what this algorithm does, it is not the concern here. But just for the sake of completeness it may solve a linear system of equations, depending on how well conditioned the system is.p  pI run it with an ill conditioned 2097152 rows sparce matrix that never converges, with at most 7 nonzero columns per row.p  pTranslating the outer codedowhilecode loop will perform 10000 iterations the value I pass as codemaxiterscode, the middle codeforcode will perform 2097152 iterations, split in chunks of codeworklinecode, divided among the OpenMP threads. The innermost codeforcode loop will have 7 iterations, except in very few cases less than 1 where it can be less.p  pThere is data dependency among the threads in the values of codesolcode array. Each iteration of the middle codeforcode updates one element but reads up to 6 other elements of the array. Since SOR is not an exact algorithm, when reading, it can have any of the previous or the current value on that position if you are familiar with solvers, this is a GaussSiedel that tolerates Jacobi behavior on some places for the sake of parallelism.p  precodetypedef struct     sizet size      unsigned int colbuffer     unsigned int rowjumper     real elements  Mat  int workline   Assumes there are no null elements on main diagonal unsigned int solveconst Mat matrix, const real rhs, real sol, real soromega, unsigned int maxiters, real tolerance      real coefs  matrixgtelements     unsigned int cols  matrixgtcolbuffer     unsigned int rows  matrixgtrowjumper     int size  matrixgtsize     real complomega  1.0  soromega     unsigned int count  0     bool done      do          done  true         pragma omp parallel shareddone                      bool tdone  true              pragma omp for nowait scheduledynamic, workline             forint i  0 i lt size i                  real newval  rhs[i]                 real diagonal                 real residual                 unsigned int end  rows[i1]                  forint j  rows[i] j lt end j                      unsigned int col  cols[j]                     ifcol  i                          real tmp                         pragma omp atomic read                         tmp  sol[col]                          newval  coefs[j]  tmp                      else                          diagonal  coefs[j]                                                        residual  fabsnewval  diagonal  sol[i]                 ifresidual gt tolerance                      tdone  false                                   newval  soromega  newval  diagonal  complomega  sol[i]                 pragma omp atomic write                 sol[i]  newval                           pragma omp atomic update             done amp tdone               whilecount lt maxiters ampamp done      return count  codepre  pAs you can see, there is no lock inside the parallel region, so, for what they always teach us, it is the kind of 100 parallel problem. That is not what I see in practice.p  pAll my tests were run on a IntelR XeonR CPU E52670 v2  2.50GHz, 2 processors, 10 cores each, hyperthread enabled, summing up to 40 logical cores.p  pOn my first set runs, codeworklinecode was fixed on 2048, and the number of threads varied from 1 to 40 40 runs in total. This is the graph with the execution time of each run seconds x number of threadsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeOQSB.png altTime x Threads, work line 2048p  pThe surprise was the logarithmic curve, so I thought that since the work line was so large, the shared caches were not very well used, so I dug up this virtual file codesysdevicessystemcpucpu0cacheindex0coherencylinesizecode that told me this processors L1 cache synchronizes updates in groups of 64 bytes 8 doubles in the array codesolcode. So I set the codeworklinecode to 8p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7sPDh.png altTime x Threads, work line 8p  pThen I thought 8 was too low to avoid NUMA stalls and set codeworklinecode to 16p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJ9X2H.png altTime x Threads, work line 16p  pWhile running the above, I thought Who am I to predict what codeworklinecode is good Lets just see..., and scheduled to run every codeworklinecode from 8 to 2048, steps of 8 i.e. every multiple of the cache line, from 1 to 256.

It is very sad that a problem that seems 100 parallel presents such bad behavior on a real machine. So, before I am convinced multicore systems are a very well sold lie, I am asking you here firstp  pHow can I make this code scale linearly to the number of cores What am I missing Is there something in the problem that makes it not as good as it seems at firstp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pFollowing suggestions, I tested both with codestaticcode and codedynamiccode scheduling, but removing the atomics readwrite on the array codesolcode. For reference, the blue and orange lines are the same from the previous graph just up to codeworkline  248code. The yellow and green lines are the new ones. For what I could see codestaticcode makes a significant difference for low codeworklinecode, but after 96 the benefits of codedynamiccode outweighs its overhead, making it faster. The atomic operations makes no difference at all.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8v4H8.png altTime x Work Line, no atomic vs atomic, dynamic vs staticp
Negative 68203 pI was wondering if theres a way to modify the depth map prior to sending it to the skeletonization algorithm used by the kinect, for example, if we want to run the skeletonization on  the output of a segmented depth image. So far I have reviewed the methods in the sdk but I havent been able to find a skeletonization method exposed. Its like you either turn the skeleton on or off but you have no control on its inputs. If anyone has any idea regarding this topic I will be much obliged.p  pShamita skeletonization means tracking the joints of the user in real time.

Negative 68203 pDoes anyone know of any way to integrate with Joomla ACL, specifically create users and log users in programatically within a custom components controller and modules.p  pIve scoured Google but either am asking the wrong questions, no one has documented how to do it, or its not possible which I dont believep  pWhy you may ask  I am developing a single sign on application for a component that must log a user into several APIs when they sign in. Unfortuanetly my client also wants this to work with ACL such that they can show control content on the front end of the website based on if a user is logged in or not.p  pSo what I need to be abole to do is create my own login view and when used, log the user into the various systems using their APIs and log them into or create an account and log into Joomla ACL.p

Negative 68203 pI am posting here for the first time, I hope this will be clear and readable.p  pI am currently trying to test the presence of usb devices on an embedded system using a specific HCD and port path programmatically using C and Visual Studio 2008.p  pThe idea is to pass in the port number and the hcd value as the parameters of the function, and the function will return a true or false that indicates the connection status.  p  pI have written some code to populate the root hub and prove that the device attached to port 1 of the root hub is a hub using codebool DeviceIsHubcode from codeusbioctl.hcode.p  pHowever, when I attempt to enumerate the usb hub attached to port 1 of root so that I may test for the connection status of the downstream ports for the presence of deviceports 1 and 2 of this usb hub. It does not seem to know how many downstream ports the usb hub has. p  pI checked USBVIEWTreeView, both application tells me that devices are there but I am not sure what ioctl command code to use such that I can enumerate the downstream ports so I can check the connection status.p  pThe structure of the device based on USB view and USB tree provides the following.p  ul lipRoot hub  it has 7 ports, only the first port is being used. pli lipA USB hub it has four available ports is attached to the first port of the root hub. pli lipTwo USB devices USB mouse and USB keyboard are attached to port 1 and port 2 of the USB hub.pli ul  pI have tried codeIOCTLUSBGETCONNECTIONINFORMATIONcode, codeIOCTLUSBGETCONNECTIONNAMEcode, code IOCTLUSBGETCONNECTIONINFORMATIONEXcode, codeIOCTLUSBPORTCONNECTORPROPERTIEScodep  pwhich is not supported, it can only be used in windows 8, this is the exact ioctl call they used to enumerate the ports.p  pPlease ignore the MessageBoxes, those are for me to check the control path status and determine which route it was following. p  pPlease find the code that I wrote as I attempt to enumeratepopulate the usb hub. I did not include the Root hub code because it would make this snippet too big. p  pMy questions mainly resides in the enumeration process of the secondary USB hub I believe. I just checked the registry key of the device. it appears that the USB hub is enumerated and present on the device since the information is shown under regedit codeHKLMgtSystemgtCurrentControlSetgtEnumgtUSBcode. I believe I am not enumerating it correctly within my test application. p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated. p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThe part that I am most concerned about is the DeviceIoControl Calls that attempts to get the size and the actual name of that USB hub.p  pIt currently only takes in USBGETNODEINFORMATION. Any other ioctl calls that are intended to retrieve the name of the hub will fail at the first DeviceIoControl where it attempts to get the size of the hub name so that it know how much memory to allocate  for it.p  pstrongUpdate Part 2strongp  pFrom observing the usbview open source code, I believe I need to enumerate the host controller and all the devices first before checking for the presence of device. I drew a conclusion such that without doing the enumeration of controller, it only goes so far down the tree at best second layer, which is where the external hub is attached to in my case. p  pI am currently attempting to enumerate the other devices and controllers in hope that I can get to the third layer of device.

Negative 68203 pIm still rather new to C and am having trouble implementing an add method that actually works. Ive done a hash map in java, but translating it to C has proven to be difficult. On top of this, I have to work with constraints such as not changing anything in the header file, and not being able to use any std library function besides stdstring, and stdcoutcin.p  pBasically, I have to create a hash map that will end up storing usernames as a key, and passwords as a value. At this point the usernamepassword combination isnt that important, since implementing a very general class is the point of the exercise.p  pJust trying to test my HashMap with a default constructor and adding a value ends up giving me a segmentation fault. Im 100 sure that Im doing something horribly wrong when trying to implement this hash table. Either Im not properly connecting the bucket index with a node, or not initializing something correctly.p  pHere is the header file that I am working withp  precodeifndef HASHMAPHPP define HASHMAPHPP  include ltfunctionalgt include ltstringgt  class HashMap  public      Hash functions must conform to these properties           1 Given a particular string s repeatedly, they must always          return the same hash value.      2 They do not take the number of buckets into account as they          do not receive a parameter that tells them how many buckets          there are.  Any unsigned int value is fair game as a result.          It will be the job of the HashMap class to reduce the results          to the range of available bucket indices e.g., by using the           operator.     typedef stdfunctionltunsigned intconst stdstringampgt HashFunction       This constant specifies the number of buckets that a HashMap will      have when it is initially constructed.     static constexpr unsigned int initialBucketCount  10   public      This constructor initializes the HashMap to use whatever default      hash function youd like it to use.  A little research online will      yield some good ideas about how to write a good hash function for      strings dont just return zero or, say, the length of the string.     HashMap       This constructor instead initializes the HashMap to use a particular      hash function instead of the default.  Well use this in our unit      tests to control the scenarios more carefully.     HashMapHashFunction hasher       The Big Three need to be implemented appropriately, so that HashMaps      can be created, destroyed, copied, and assigned without leaking      resources, interfering with one another, or causing crashes or      undefined behavior.     HashMapconst HashMapamp hm     HashMap     HashMapamp operatorconst HashMapamp hm       add takes a key and a value.  If the key is not already stored in      this HashMap, the keyvalue pair is added if the key is already      stored, the function has no effect.           If adding the new keyvalue pair will cause the load factor of this      HashMap to exceed 0.8, the following must happen           1 The number of buckets should be increased by doubling it and          adding 1 i.e., if there were 10 buckets, increase it to          2  10  1  21.      2 All keyvalue pairs should be rehashed into their new buckets,          important because changing the number of buckets will likely          change which bucket a particular key hashes to especialy if          youre using  to determine the index of that bucket.     void addconst stdstringamp key, const stdstringamp value       remove takes a key and removes it and its associated value from      this HashMap if it is already present if not, the function has no      effect.     void removeconst stdstringamp key       contains returns true if the given key is in this HashMap, false      if not.     bool containsconst stdstringamp key const       value returns the value associated with the given key in this HashMap      if the key is stored in this HashMap if not, the empty string is      returned.  Going forward, well discover that throwing an exception      is a better way to handle the scenario where the key is not present,      but well conquer that at a later date.     stdstring valueconst stdstringamp key const       size returns the number of keyvalue pairs stored in this HashMap.     unsigned int size const       bucketCount returns the number of buckets currently allocated in      this HashMap.     unsigned int bucketCount const       loadFactor returns the proportion of the number of keyvalue pairs      to the number of buckets, a measurement of how full the HashMap is.      For example, if there are 20 keyvalue pairs and 50 buckets, we would      say that the load factor is 2050  0.4.     double loadFactor const       maxBucketSize returns the number of keyvalue pairs stored in this      HashMaps largest bucket.     unsigned int maxBucketSize const   private      This structure describes the nodes that make up the linked lists in      each of this HashMaps buckets.     struct Node              stdstring key         stdstring value         Node next             Store the hash function either the default hash function or the one      passed to the constructor as a parameter in this member variable.      When you want to hash a key, call this member variable i.e., follow      it with parentheses and a parameter just like you would any other      function.     HashFunction hasher        You will no doubt need to add at least a few more private members      public      our hash function     unsigned int hashFuncconst stdstringamp key const  private     Node hashTable       We need a variable that will always let us know what the current amount      of buckets is. bucketCount will use this and return this variable.     unsigned int amountOfBuckets      we also need the number of keys currently in the hash map.

Negative 68203 pSo for a project, the gist of it is that I am trying to transport people through a bunch of cities vertexes and roads edges. The weights on the roads are the maximum number of passengers on a bus so a weight of 25 would mean I could only take 25 passengers. What Im trying to find is the minimum amount of trips. So on a path from city 1 to 4 with 103025, I could only take 10 people max. While, on a different path of 404555, I can take a maximum of 40 people. The first path means I have to make 10 trips for 100 people, while the second one I can take everyone in 3 trips. p  pSo I need to write an algorithm to find the minimum number of trips and dont know how. Smallest path No problem. Largest path Easy also. Directed graph Easy. But this.... I dont know. It also has to run in ONedges time, which makes it different than other similar questions. Im thinking maybe I could use topological sort but am not 100 sure since this graph is undirected.p

Negative 68203 pIm trying to use jQuery UIs resizable method with flexbox Maybe thats the problem But Id say not likely.p  pI have 3 columns and I want the left and right columns to be resizable and have the center column take up any remaining space. My CSS looks like thisp  precode.container    display flex   .colleft, .colright    width 200px   .colcenter    flex 1  codepre  pThe left column works fine with this jqueryp  precode.colleft.resizable   handles e  codepre  pAnd the only property that gets added when resized is width, but when I use this for the right columnp  precode.colright.resizable   handles w  codepre  pThe width AND left properties get added. The left property really messes up the layout. It pulls the left column over the center column while also squishing it with the width, so the end result is really wonky. In my inspector, if I remove the left property it seems to work just fine.p  pIve read through the documentation here a few times, but I dont see anywhere how I would turn this off.p  pHeres a pen where Ive recreated the problem a hrefhttpcodepen.iodustindowellpenNPyaBL relnofollowhttpcodepen.iodustindowellpenNPyaBLap  pA workaround would be to listen for the resize event and just overwrite the CSS but this seems bad.p  precode.colright.resizable   handles w .onresize, function    this.css     left 0     codepre  pUPDATEp  pAfter some digging around I found out that this is a jQuery UI bug.p  pBug Ticket a hrefhttpbugs.jqueryui.comticket4985comment1 relnofollowhttpbugs.jqueryui.comticket4985comment1ap

Negative 68203 pI am a beginner Android developer and have an issue with WebView. My application runs in my Main Activity. When a TextView is clicked, it opens a new activity that is a WebView. p  pWhen I use the phones back button to back out of the WebView to get back to the Main Activity, it displays a blank screen before getting completely out of the webview activity. I also see this same blank screen very briefly after leaving the Main Activity and before the website initially starts to load.p  pThe interesting thing is this only happens when the target website is optimized for mobile, for example, en.m.wikipedia.org, Nonmobile sites back out to the Main Activity without this extra blank screen.p  pIve done a lot of research and cannot find anything unique to opening mobile URLs.

Negative 68203 pThe question is simple in a typical emdynamic programmingem solution, how can one print the actual states that were traversed during computation of the final solutionp  pLet me try to explain with the help of an example what exactly I needp  pSuppose, we have a codeDPcode solution to a problem where each state will have twodimensions i.e. a state in the solution will look like codei,jcode. Now, we have a emstarting stateem code0,0code and some emfinal statesem codei,ncode, where codeicode varies from 0 to n. p  pSo, a typical solution will work like thisp  precodeStart from a starting state in this case gt 0,0 Move to the next state based on some computation suppose from 0,0, we could go to 1,0, 1,1 or 1,2. . . Keep on traversing until we reach one of the end states in this case i,n, for any i. codepre  pNow, I need to print the path traversed in this solution. Basically, if I can find out from which state I reached the emfinal stateem, I can use that logic to go back upto the emstarting stateem and consequently print the path.p  pP.S. Apologies if the question seems too obvious.p

If there are multiple extended clients which keep joining and leaving oracle coherence cluster, then there are chances that one service created some caches and left the cluster but those caches are present in cluster.p  pI want all the cache names present in the cluster at any point of time.p  pIs it possible to get all cache namesp  pThere is an API in codecacheServicecode called codegetCacheNamescode which returns all cache names corresponding to that service.p  pBut how to get the cache names created by other services belonging to clients which are no more active but caches are present in clusterp  p[UPDATE]  There is a command called maps which gives all the caches present in servercreated by all clients. But i am not able to find any APi to do the same operation.p  pIs there any API to execute maps command or any way to execute this command directly using JAVA code.p
Negative 68203 pIve just started to learn some Spring and I tried to create a simple CRUD application. After completing some tutorial, my application couldnt be build. I made some serious changes in the code, so eventually I deleted everything in my workspace, and created a new project using Spring Project Starter. Running only the startup project I got this error in consolep  precode20150423 171204.436  INFO 8120  [           main] demo.DemoApplication                      Starting DemoApplication on

Negative 68203 pI am trying to build a generic data structure that needs to hold keys and values and in the same time keep track on the indexs in which keys and values were put in like arraylist do just in a complexity of Olog n or less.p  pI tryed to work around a solution to this problem and created various TreeMaps that has Integer  indexs and valuse and viseversa, and the same with keys.p  pJust to make it more clear, the Indexs symbolize the insertion order from the user. so if I had 3 elements then their indexs are 0 1 2 and if element 0 was deleted then I need to push 1 to 0 and 2 to 1 and a new element would be added with index 2.p  pMy problem is when I remove a key and its value, if I want to insert the next key and value in the right index I have to make sure all the old ones were set back by 1. I dont know how to do it and not to fall into On complexity.p  pMy goal is to use existing data structures and mixing them to get this result, please take a look at the methods I implemented as I need those.p  pI am adding my code for reference, any help would be much appreciated.p  pThank youp  pTomp  precodeimport java.util.Collection import java.util.HashMap import java.util.TreeMap import

Negative 68203 pIm new to php and sqlite and Im trying to modify the registration form of a website. I did what I thought were all the necessary changes but I cant make it work now since when I use a email to register it tells me it already exists. The form used a username before and checked if the username already existed. If it did then it displays a message. Now I dont want to use a username but the email to register and, even though the database is empty, it always tells me that the email already exists. I left only the email for registration to make it simpler to understand. But even then the problem persists.p  pI think theres a problem while checking the database but I dont know where the problem lies. I dont understand very well the flow between the php pages so if someone could help me clarify what is exactly happening I would appreciate it. Here is the code of the registration page.p  precodeParticipate.php  lthr classstructure gt lth1 classoutgtMain contentlth1gt ltdiv classeb1gt    ltTYPO3SEARCHbegingt   lth2 classoutgtTopinformationenlth2gt   ltTYPO3SEARCHendgt  ltdivgt ltdiv classeb2gt    ltTYPO3SEARCHbegingt   lth2gtParticipatelth2gt ltpgtPlease register.ltpgt   lt LOGINFORM gt ltdiv classbox big formgt  ltform idparticipateForm action targettop onSubmitreturn checkform methodpost nameparticipategt     ltfieldset classnolegendgt         ltlegendgtParticpateltlegendgt         ltdivgt             ltlabel foremailgt                 ltspangt Email ltphp echo issetPOST[email]  ltstronggtThe email ampldquo .POST[email]. amprdquo already exists. ltstronggt   gtltspangtltinput typeemail nameemail requiredgt             ltlabelgt         ltdivgt     ltfieldsetgt     ltdiv classmorelinkgt         ltpgtltinput typesubmit namesubmit valueParticipate onclickshowform return FALSEgtltpgt     ltdivgt ltformgt ltdivgtlt box big form gt ltdivgt codepre  pSo if I understand correctly when you click the Participate button the page calls itself action with the email as a post variable. The thing is that theres nothing on this particular page that uses that variable so I guess this code is reloading the index.php page which starts like this.p  precodeindex.php  ltPHP     Session wird gestartet     sessionstart         Includ PHP functions     include.dataphpfunctions.php         Funktionen werden ausgefhrt     ifissetGET[do]          ifGET[do]logout         logout                 else if emptyGET[email]ampamp session         loginGET[email]            ifpostvarsubmitlogin ampamp session          login0,0            else if postvarsubmitparticipate ampamp session          register            else if postvarsubmitemote ampamp session          saveMood        gt codepre  pWithin this functions.php code that is included in the index.php page are the functions to access the database. So two of those functions are these.p  precodefunctions.php  function postvarvar      if issetPOST[var]     erg  POST[var]     erg  trimerg          else      ergNULL     return erg   function register      global open, settings, dbusr      email  postvaremail      ifprivacy ampamp terms     ifTRUE              query  SELECT  FROM usrdata WHERE email.email.         resusr  dbusrgtpreparequery         resusrgtexecute         countresusrgtfetchColumn          ifcount1          query INSERT INTO usrdata email, regtime, status, sessionID VALUES .email., .time.,0, new         dbusrgtqueryquery          headerLocation .settings[Main].openLoginampinfo1                  else                  openLoginFailed                codepre  pSo what I think its happening is this and I will appreciate if someone tells me if Im completely lost or if I need to put some other part of the code to clarify. So the participate.php calls itself with the email send on this post variable. Somehow, and I dont know exactly how, the functions.php code is called and this register function is used to check if the email exists and, if not, to add it to the database. The thing is that its not working. This code worked before when instead of email it used a username. The registration actually worked then.p  pBy the way the checkform function that is called in the Participate.php code just does this.p  precodefunction checkform                    if document.participate.email.value                                            alertPlease enter an email.                       document.participate.email.focus                       return false                      codepre  pEdit 1p  pOriginal Code Participate.phpp  precode lthr classstructure gt lth1 classoutgtMain contentlth1gt ltdiv classeb1gt    ltTYPO3SEARCHbegingt   lth2 classoutgtTopinformationenlth2gt   ltTYPO3SEARCHendgt  ltdivgt ltdiv classeb2gt    ltTYPO3SEARCHbegingt   lth2gtParticipatelth2gt ltpgtRegister here.ltpgt   lt LOGINFORM gt ltdiv classbox big formgt  ltform idparticipateForm action targettop onSubmitreturn checkform methodpost nameparticipategt     ltfieldset classnolegendgt         ltlegendgtParticpateltlegendgt         ltdivgt             ltlabel forusergt                 ltspangt Username ltphp echo issetPOST[username]  ltstronggtThe username ampldquo .POST[username]. amprdquo already exists.

Negative 68203 pfor instance. I have an ajax call that will request itemInfo from server at which point my server will receive the request for itemInfo, followed by checking if the itemInfo request came with the correct itemInfo variable. If this is not the caseundefined it should then send something that looks like the example below back to the client.p  precode inputRequiredtrue, queries[     questionNameItem Number,     descriptionan Item Number is required,     dataTypestring,     charQty12,     ,     ]  codepre  pUpon arrival the client Browser will then use these commands to construct the correct form. There could be more than one type and number of input needed. If the user then fills in this form correctly. The next time around the server will be able to create the proper itemInfo query.

Negative 68203 pIm currently updating an old, large piece of software written in C that sends a struct through a socket to a server.  The updated software will be written in Python, which means I now need to send the same information in the same byte layout as the C struct in Python.  Im aware of the Python package struct, and would like to use it. The problem is, the struct is absolutely huge.  To give you an idea, heres a snipetp  precode this is the struct that I wish to send   typedef struct      struct stcommandheader header      union          char buffer[32]         struct set360cameramessage cameramsg         struct uolcdmsg olcdmsg           structtobeset stc    supporting structs  struct stcommandheader    union  ualltypes len   union  ualltypes cmd   union  ualltypes cmdcounter   union  ualltypes items  attributepacked  struct uolcdmsg       over 100 lines of fields to fill    all the other structs necessary codepre  pAs I understand it, the struct python package requires you manually pack the struct, which would be very difficult given the size of the struct and number of union statements.  Ideally, Id like some way to utilize the existing code by generating the struct in C but somehow transferring over the bytes to my Python code for the socket.  Is there a way to do this  I have looked into ctypes and swig, but I didnt see an easy way to get the byte representation from the C code.  p

Negative 68203 pI need to setup a database that will track an inventory of items parts, components, etc contained inside other items boxes, enclosures, etc.p  pIm new to database designusage, but Im familiar with the basics and how to Google, however Im currently stuck on how to actually track items contained inside other items at the database level.p  pIn short, if a query returns eitherp  ol lian item contained by another item such as a component inside an enclosureli lian item such as an enclosure that contains other itemsli ol  pthen I want to include the containing item, or the contained item, along with the original item, in the query results.p  pTo resolve 1 above, I figure I can include a codecontaineridcode field in my DB schema that references the ID of the containing item, then write a fancy SELECT query that appropriately consults any codecontaineridcode values it finds and automatically includes those results. I have no idea how to do this though.p  pIm completely stuck on how to resolve problem 2. If an item Im searching for such as a box contains multiple child items the contents of the box, I want to include the box, and its contents ie, all of the child items, in the results. I have no idea how to represent this relationship in terms of SQL queries or DB design.p  pFurthermore, if I have 5 of a given item say, a sound card, 1 might exist in a computer case, 2 might exist in a box inside a container in the corner, and 2 more might be in this quickgrab tray on my desk. I need to be able to recognize all of this at the DB level and track it.p  pIm asking here because I simply have no idea what to Google as Im on completely unfamiliar territory in this situation.p  pFor what its worth, the database will probably only contain about 4000 or so items as a reasonable read decently padded upper limit  so while it would certainly be both inelegant and inefficient to simply query through the database multiple times, it wouldnt be the absolute end of the world if I was able to find a query technique that didnt skyrocket too exponentially.p  pAlso, for reference, this is not a homework challenge although it sure does feel like one  I need to clean up my garage embigtimeem, and there are so many tiny bits and pieces its gotten to the point where I critically need to build an inventory system to keep track of everything.p

Negative 68203 pI have a picturebox called imagebox which has an image loaded into it via a filebrowserdialog. I have another picturebox which loads the image of the first picturebox into it and that one is called canvasbox. By clicking the first picturebox, it loads the image into the second picturebox. The second picturebox will be where I draw on the image and make changes to it before rendering a final image. My question is, how would I make the second picturebox a zoomed in version I mean to where you can see the pixels in a grid like in Paint.Net Because the first picturebox will always be a small resolution of 32x32 or 64x32, etc so I am trying to make it to where in the second picturebox, you can use a pencil tool and pencil in the pixels precisely where you want them. I want this picturebox to automatically be zoomed in. No scroll wheel zoom or anything. Lets say, I will zoom in at a fixed percentage or something. Enough to where you can easily see the pixel grid. but I need the changes to show up in real time in the first picturebox as I am editing it to see what it looks like in its original size as I edit it in the zoomed size. Later, when I render it, it will be rendered in the same format it started in the first picturebox. I hope I am explaining this well enough. I dont have any code on this because I absolutely have no idea where to begin on something like this. p
