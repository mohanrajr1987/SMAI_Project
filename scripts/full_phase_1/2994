Positive 2994 pI normally have no Problem with binding a DataSource to a GridControl.

I can add and delete rows from the grid and they will get added to  deleted from the DataSource myList. So I basically always see whats in my List.p  pBut now I dont have a List, where the Generic Type has Properties, but I have a List filled with strings.p  precodeBindingListltstringgt codepre  pWhen I Try to bind the List to my grid, it wont get that the strings themselves are what i want bound to the rows of my column and since string doesnt have any properties, there is nothing I can fill the columns .FielName with.p  pI know I could use a wrapper class to solve this problem, but I dont find this solution to be very nice.p  pIs there a way to tell the column, that the data it should use is the Objects, in this case the strings, themselves p  pTanks for the help.p  pstrongUPDATE1strongp  pThis is something I tried. I thought if I could make my own GridControl and override the setter for the DataSource Property, I could make an internal Wrapper so that anyone who uses it wont need do so. This kind of works.

Of course it doenst work since adding an Object to the DataSource uses the basicempty constructor, wich in turn means that my DataSource doesnt have that connection to the original List, wich is the one I want the new objects to be in. I will work on this and update again.p  pstrongUPDATE3strong Couldnt think of any better solution, so I went with the initial approach and built a wrapper class for my strings.

Negative 2994 pIm writing a background application to copy files in a loop to a USB stick with the Optimize for quick removal policy set. However, if the stick is removed part way through this process specifically in the WriteFile call below, which returns ERROR FILE NOT FOUND the application hangs, the drive is then permanently inaccessible from any other application and the PC cannot be shutdownlogged offrestarted etc. All running instances of Windows Explorer also hang as a result.p  pI have traced the issue to the CloseHandle call made after the stick is removed and the above error occurs. Its almost as if CloseHandle is blocking indefinitely in the driver somewhere because the stick is no longer there Anyway, I have managed to get past this issue by simply skipping the CloseHandle call if WriteFile returns ERROR FILE NOT FOUND. However, this leads to another problem where, every so often, a file gets irrecoverably corrupted and the only way to fix it is using chkdsk, or reformat the stick. p  pNote that this only happens on XP SP2 and 3, Vista does not seem to suffer from the issue.

I also want to limit the file size to under 2mb, so I will test thathavent implemented in code yet.  If the file they have selected passes, then I want the label to say File Accepted, and store the file upload information for a later button click.  This will happen once the user has finished filling out the rest of the form.  Eventually, I will put an UpdateProgress control on the page while it is checking if the file is allowed.  I would rather not have it post back for this, so if I can get it to work, that would be great.  BTW, this will all work fine if I take the label out of the update panel.p  pWhat happens when I run this, is it will go to the else statement of the first if and return Please select a file.  Meaning that FileUpload1.HasFile is returning false.

Negative 2994 pI need some framework that will help me to do asynchronous streaming over http. It may look like SOAP WS or somethign else. I dont know if I name it correctly, so here is what I needp  pServerA wants to make a request to remote ServerB over http. The request contains arbitrary information. Result for it is going to contain multiple records of the same type. Some of them are available immediately, other are available later. ServerA wants to get available results as soon as possible, without waiting until all results are available. In real world ServerB will search across different data sources, some of which are more responsive that other.p  pI can think of 3 kinds of solution. First, ServerA generates random id of request, performs SOAP request p  precodevoid ServerB.startSearchid, request codepre  pthat will return immediately, and then A periodically calls p  precodeResult[] ServerB.areThereAnyNewResultsid codepre  pSo ServerA polls ServerB fore new reasults. I call this method polling. It involves multiple connections established from A to B. Another solution is to expose receiving service on ServerA side, like p  precodeServerA.acceptResultsString id, Result[] newResults codepre  pand call p  precodeServerB.startSearchid, request, serverAReceivingServiceEndpoindAddress codepre  pSo ServerB pushes new results to ServerA.acceptResults when new results are available. I call it pushing. It involves 1 connection established from A to B and multiple connection established from B to A.p  pAnother option is to stream results over same http channel, within single response.p  pA performs http call I dont know if it can be SOAP or should be something else, B starts searching and when new results are available, it sends them over http stream and flushes it, so they may be available on the A side immediately. It does not close http connection until all results are available. It involves only single connection from A to B, thats why I would prefer to use it. I call it streaming. I understand that it may not work if some proxy is on the way that buffers the response content.p  pSo, my question is if there is any solution that will do most of the work for me. What Id like to do is call such code on A sidep  precodeService s  new RemoteAsyncServicehttpserverb.comserviceEndpoint, RemoteAsyncService.STREAMING   or RemoteAsyncService.POLLING, or RemoteAsyncService.PUSHING Request r  new Request... Callback callback  new Callback  void newResultsResult[] result...   e should be null if finished correctly  void requestFinishedRemoteException e...  s.searchrequest, callback codepre  pAnd implement it on ServerB sidep  precodepublic ServiceImpl implements Service   void searchRequest r, Callback c     perform search, call c.newResult when new results are available     codepre  pAnd the rest is handled by framework, including reestablishing connection when it is dropped, falling to pollingpushing if streaming can not be done because of buffering proxy, calling callback.requestFinished when ServerB finishes work or throws the exception, etc. Probbaly it should also handle authentication in some standard way.p  pSo, is there any solution that abstracts the way commuinication is done, and is capabale of streaming when possible p  pIf there is not, do you think it would be useful to implement it as open source p
Negative 2994 pCurrently I have tables like codePages, Groups, GroupPage, Users, UserGroupcode. With pickled sets I can implement the same thing with only 3 tables codePages, Groups, Userscode.p  pcodesetcode seems a natural choice for implementing ACL, as group and permission related operations can be expressed very naturally with sets. If I store the allowdeny lists as pickled sets, it can eliminate few intermediate tables for manytomany relationship and allow permission editing without many database operations.p  pIf human readability is important, I can always use json instead of cPickle for serialization and use codesetcode when manipulating the permission list in Python. It is highly unlikely that permissions will ever be edited directly using SQL. So is it a good design ideap  pWere using SQLAlchemy as ORM, so its likely to be implemented with codePickleTypecode column. Im not planning to store the whole pickled resource recordset, only the codesetcode object made out of resource primary key values.p

I have a C .Net 2.0 program which creates an instance of QuickTest.Application and launches QuickTest Professional version 10.0. All my development testing worked well.p  pThis morning, I attempted to execute the program from a test machine without the development environment SharpDevelop 2.2.1.

Negative 2994 pIm attempting to use Unity for the first time and I think I might have bitten off more than I can chew. We have a ntier application that has a base library with several abstract types and then several business scenario specific libraries on top of it w concrete types. For ex The abstract type lead has two implementations, one in a NewAutomotiveLibrary called NewAutomotiveLead and one in an AutomotiveFinanceLibrary called AutomotiveFinanceLead. Within the base library we have a set of adapters that perform logic on the base types like Lead.p  pIm trying to use Unity for the first time to return an interface ILeadDuplication that when resolved, returns either an instance of NewAutomotiveLeadDuplication or AutomotiveFinanceLeadDuplication when I called resolve on ILeadDuplication and pass either a string value of either NewAutomotive or AutomotiveFinance names mapped when RegisterType was called on the container. Like sop  precode  using IUnityContainer container  new UnityContainer        container       .RegisterTypeltILeadDuplication, AutomotiveFinanceLeadDuplicationgtAutomotiveFinance       .RegisterTypeltILeadDuplication, NewAutomotiveLeadDuplicationgtNewAutomotive      ILeadDuplication dupe  container.ResolveltILeadDuplicationgtAutomotiveFinance     Console.WriteLinedupe.Created    codepre  pNOTE This is for illustration, because the library doesnt know anything about the concreate classes for ILeadDuplication the actually registration would need to be done in the config file.p  pWhile this all works great, I need to take it a step further. When calling resolve, I need to be able to pass in an argument of type Lead which is the base type for either NewAutomotiveLead or AutomotiveFinanceLead.p  pI need to know if its possible that Unity somehow magically look a property specific to the concrete instance AutomotiveFinanceLead such as GrossMonthlyIncome that doesnt exist on Lead and assign it to a new created AutomotiveFinanceLeadDuplication instances property GrossMonthlyIncome.p  pId effectively like to be able to perform a generic set of logic against instances of ILeadDuplication in the base library even thought the instances being generated and properties being mapped are unfamiliar to it.p  pThanksp

Negative 2994 pI have been pounding my head against a wall trying to figure out what I think is a simple thing to do, but I have, so far, been unable to figure it out with the iPhone SDK.  I have a view with 4 buttons.  When I push the buttons, I have another view called and come up to take over the screen.  I want to have a simple variable passed from the old view to the new view.  The purpose of this is to know what button was pressed out of the four identical ones. trying to get an int value of 1 through 4 Here is what I have tried so farp  pI initially tried to call the variable from the class itself.  My understanding was that my new view was only sitting on top of the old view, so it should not have been released.  I could not get access to the variable as the variable was said to not be declared.p  pI then tried to create a method that would return the int value.  Again, the view class was not seen and was being declared as a first use of it.p  pI then attempted to follow another similar post on here that suggested to try and send the button tag number to some part of the new view.  I attempted to do this by setting the new views button title but I still cannot figure out a way to code it without coming up with errors.  p  pI am just looking for what method would be the best for me to pursue.  I have no problem going back and reading the books on ObjectiveC, but Im just trying to figure out which way I should concentrate on.  Thank you for any insight.  p

Of course, you can always install packages within R with codeinstall.packagescode, but there are dozens of DebianUbuntu R packages, and excuse me for saying this, but its painstaking job to track them down. codercranlatticecode can be replaced with codeinstall.packageslatticecode, but what about coderevolutionrcode coderevolutionmklcode Id like to have RA optimizations in Arch. p  pCould you, please, give me some advice about this one Whats the catch codercorecode, coderbasedevcode, coderbasecoredbgcode, coderbasecoreracode... Actually, I have two questionsp  ul liWhats the difference between these coderbasecode packages and standard R installationli liAnd how can I port DebianUbuntu packages to Arch Im talking only about those packages that dont come bundled with an official installation, like codercrancode and RevolutionRlike packagesli ul  pIt would be nice if emArchemers could have outofthebox support for R, like Debian, Ubuntu, Suse and Fedora users. I know its manageable, I just want to know how hard it is.p

Negative 2994 pIve been spending about an hour searching for a concensus on something Im trying to accomplish, but have yet to find anything conclusive in a particular direction.p  pMy situation is as followsp  ul liI have a multithreaded application .NET web serviceli liI have classes that use objects that take nonnegligible time to load, so I would like to maintain them as static class membersli liThe code that constructs these objects intermittently has a low chance of failureli ul  pI was previously using an approach that constructs these objects in a static constructor.  The problem with this was that, as mentioned above, the constructor would occasionally fail, and once a .NET static constructor fails, the whole class is hosed until the process is restarted. There are no second chances with that approach.p  pThe most intuitiveseeming approach after this was to use doublechecked locking.  There are a lot of pages around that talk about the evils of doublechecked locking and say to use a static constructor, which I was already doing, but that doesnt seem to be an option for me, as the static constructor has the potential to fail and bring down the whole class.p  pThe implementation simplified, of course Im thinking of using is the following.  All class and member names are purely demonstrative and not what Im actually using. Is this approach going to be problematic  Can anyone suggest a better approach  p  precodepublic class LazyMembers      private static volatile XmlDocument sdoc     private static volatile XmlNamespaceManager snsmgr     private static readonly object slock  new object      private static void EnsureStaticMembers              if sdoc  null  snsmgr  null                      lock slock                              if sdoc  null  snsmgr  null                                       The following method might fail                      with an exception, but if it succeeds,                      sdoc and snsmgr will be initialized                     sdoc  LoadDocout snsmgr                                                  public XmlNamespaceManager NamespaceManager              get                      EnsureStaticMembers             return snsmgr                    public XmlDocument GetDocClone              EnsureStaticMembers         return XmlDocumentsdoc.Clone       codepre

Negative 2994 pLately I bumped repeatedly into the concept of LFSR, that I find quite interesting because of its links with different fields and also fascinating in itself.

However, this is just meant to show how it circles through its possible states, in fact you noticed the register is represented by a string.

Negative 2994 pThis is from a homework assignmentp  blockquote   pAssume that each page disk block has 16K bytes and each KVP has 8 bytes. Thus   we decide to use a Btree of minsize 1600082  1000. Let T be such a Btree and   suppose that height of T is 3.

Negative 2994 pDear fellow Java developersp  pI am trying to import into eclipse a web project that uses Spring, Hibernate, and JSPs.  This web application was developed also in eclipse, and for some reason, when I try to import into my workspace, I am able to import it as a standard project, which prevents me from running it on tomcat.  I need to import this project into eclipse as a dynamic web project so that it runs on tomcat that is setup in eclipse.

Negative 2994 pIm coding an abstract strategy game with C amp XNA. As for the AI, Im currently using Negascout and a depth of 5. The following is the description of the gamep  pThe game consists of a board of 6x7 hexagonal locations, 42 hexagonal tiles, and 6 pieces 1 king amp 5 pawns for each player max 2 players. p  pDuring the first phase of the game, the players alternately place a random tile on an empty location of the board. Each tile can have a maximum of 6 arrows pointing at the edges. Some arrows can be doublepointed. The arrows mean the directions of movement from that tile. A doublepointed arrow makes a piece movejump 2 locations if theres a valid location. The players are not allowed to place tiles in their opponents row if there are still empty locations left on the board.p  pOnce this phase is complete, the next player in turn places his king on any one of the 6 tiles of the row nearest to him. Next, the movement of the pieces commences. Pieces are moved according to the arrows on the tiles. The game is won by capturing or blocking the king.p  pOk, so now to my move generation function.p  ol lipTile placement stage a Place a tile on the nearest row. The tile is rotated to find the optimal rotation.  b Once the nearest row is full, place a tile on an empty location that is surrounded by locations on all sides ie no edge of board. Rotate the tile to find the optimal rotation.  c If no locations are found, add all remaining empty locations, trying to find the optimal rotation.pli lipKing placement stage a Locate the location with the best tile and place the king there.  b Place the remaining pawns on the remaining empty locations on the row.pli lipMovement stage a If king is attacked, try to attack the attacking piece if that piece is not defended.  b Add moves for all players pieces that are being attacked. c Add all opponent pieces that the player can attack. d Add all locations player can move to.pli ol  pNow to the evaluation function.p  ol lipTile placement stage score  No. of tiles current player placed so far  current players tiles on the nearest row  no. of tiles opponent placed so far  opponents tiles on the furthest row nearest to the opponent.pli lipKing placement stage score  current players tiles on the nearest row  opponents tiles on the furthest row nearest to the opponent.pli lipMovement stage score  current players pieces value  opponents pieces value.pli ol  pThe weighting of the tiles is 100 for every valid location an arrow points to.

Sometimes this occurs in his home row.pli lipWhen moving pieces, the AI is ignoring king safety.

Negative 2994 pIm making an iphone app that communicates with a CakePHP site. On the app amp site the user logs in and a session is generated. On the site the session persists but it does not on the app. It seems to expire after about an hour between requests.p  pI edited Cakes core config file to use CAKEPHP for Session.cookie, set the Session.timeout to be a very big number e.g. 1036800 and finally Security.level to low.p  pThe iPhone app displays the token Im sending up to Cake and the token Cake is expecting for the user, unfortunately the token its expecting is always emptydeleted.p  pWhen testing I set the Session.timeout value to be 1 5 minutes and 2 ten minutes and the session expired at the correct times, but setting it to a large number just seems to make it expire at about an hour p  pany ideas would be great Dp

Negative 2994 pI wish to use IBM WebSphere Message Broker probably V6 to consume some CSV files, perform some validation and then populate some Java objects for consumption by a Java application.

Negative 2994 pId like to write a Clojure codewithtesttagscode macro that wraps a bunch of forms, and adds some metadata to the name of each codedeftestcode form  specifically, add some stuff to a codetagscode key, so that I can play with a tool to run tests with a specific tag.p  pOne obvious implementation for codewithtesttagscode is to walk the entire body recursively, modifying each codedeftestcode form as I find it. But Ive been reading emLet Over Lambdaem recently, and he makes a good point instead of walking the code yourself, just wrap the code in a codemacroletcode and let the compiler walk it for you. Something likep  precodedefmacro withtesttags [tags amp body]   macrolet [deftest [name amp more]                 deftest varymeta name updatein [tags] fnil into [] tags                    more]      do body  withtesttags [a b]    deftest x ...do tests... codepre  pThis has the obvious problem, though, that the codedeftestcode macro continues to expand recursively forever. I could make it expand to codeclojure.testdeftestcode instead, thus avoiding any further recursive expansions, but then I cant usefully nest instances of codewithtesttagscode to label subgroups of tests.p  pAt this point, especially for something as simple as codedeftestcode, it looks like walking the code myself will be simpler. But I wonder if anyone knows a technique for writing a macro which slightly modifies certain subexpressions, without recursing forever.p  pFor the curious I considered some other approaches, such as having a compiletime codebindingcodeable var that I set as I go up and down the code, and using that var when I finally see a codedeftestcode, but since each macro only returns a single expansion its bindings wont be in place for the next call to macroexpand.p  h3Edith3  pI did the postwalk implementation just now, and while it works it doesnt respect special forms such as codequotecode  it expands inside of those as well.p  precodedefmacro withtesttags [tags amp body]   cons do         postwalk fn [form]                     if and seq form                              symbol first form                               deftest name first form                       seq updatein vec form [1]                                       varymeta updatein [tags] fnil into [] tags                       form                   body codepre  pAlso, sorry for possible noise on the commonlisp tag ndash I thought you might be able to help out with weirder macro stuff even with minimal Clojure experience.p

Negative 2994 pI have a Request class that is used to retrieve a file resource from an external process, using a method codeRetrieveResourcecode. This method takes approximately 1015 seconds to complete. In addition, the codeRequestcode class contains four child objects, which are instantiated using dependency injection during the construction of the class, to access the contents of the requested file. p  pThe codeRequestcode class is instantiated from the main class of the project. The main class calls codeRetrieveResourcecode approximately every 30 seconds. After each invocation, it may be necessary to adjust a particular property, for example, Property A, of one or more of the emchild objectsem of the codeRequestcode class.p  pI would be interested to hear views of the best way to accomplish this. The following list describes three approaches that could be used to change the value of Property Ap  ol lipThe main class explicitly sets the value of Property A on each child object of the Request object by calling the property directly. For example, codeRequest.Object1.PropertyA  newValuecode pli lipCreate a method in the Request class to update the value of Property A on each child object, for example, codeUpdatePropertyAcodepli lipWhen creating an instance of the codeRequestcode class, pass a builder class that is responsible for creating a new codeRequestcode instance, including the creation of the each of the four objects using DI. The builder class contains a property, for example, Property A, which is then used to set the value of the property of the name for each child object of the Request class.pli ol  pGrateful to hear thoughts.

Negative 2994 pIm working on a project thats trying to implement some editing features using a contentEditable DIV. Were now trying to add support for IE9 after initally providing ChromeSafari support and its proving to be a challenge. p  pWhat we are able to do in Chrome is have codeltimggtcode objects inside a content editable div, and allow those codeltimggtcode elements to be draggeddropped, but not resized. Additionally, pressing TAB in the contentEditable div should not select the codeltimggtcodep  pIn IE 9, I have found some methods for stopping the images from being resized like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4795132permittingmovingonlyofimgswithincontenteditabledivPermitting moving only of ltimggts within contentEditable ltdivgta but even that still shows those darn resize handles when clicking on an image. My big problem is that in IE 9, when Im typing inside the contenteditable div, and I hit TAB, I want the browser to select the next item on the web page in our application, it is another contentEditable div. This works in Chrome, but in IE, when I hit TAB, the codeltimggtcode is selected with the resize handles showing upp  pDoes anyone know if there is a way to disable the selection using tab functionality in IE 9p  pHeres a simple test case that disables the resizing, still allows draganddrop, but the codeltimggtcode is still selected via TABp  precodelthtmlgt   ltheadgt     lttitlegtlttitlegt     ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.4.1jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt   document.readyfunction     This line below doesnt work in IE9   document.execCommandenableObjectResizing, false, false      img, edit.eachfunction i, item          item.attachEventonresizestart, functione              e.returnValue  false          , false          I thought this below might work for disabling selection,           but it doesnt...         item.attachEventonbeforeeditfocus, functione              e.returnValue  false         , false            ltscriptgt    ltheadgt   ltbodygt      ltdiv idedit contenteditabletruegt       Here is some text, and also an ltimg srchttpimg841.imageshack.usimg8411747imagead.png gt image     ltdivgt    ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 2994 pIve imported some data from a CSV file in matlab. They are time series that are all aligned the fact that they are time series is not important, just that each column represents a single entity, and the rows are observations for that entity. This give me say, a 2500x50 matrix of doubles called codedatacode and a 1x50 cell array called codecolheaderscode.p  pWhat I am trying to do is use the Neural Network toolset to predict each entity i.e., column from all the others. The Neural Network tool takes as input a target a single column of the matrix and input the original matrix but with the same column used as target removed from the matrix.p  pSuppose the entries in codecolheaderscode are of the form Col1, Col2, Col3, etc. Id like to automate the process of training the model and making predictions for each column of the original matrix so that I have as output a bunch of prediction columns labeled PredictedCol1, PredictedCol2, etc.p  pI think I can figure out the Neural Network part but I just dont know how to begin on the matrix manipulation and crossreferencing to the codecolheaderscode array. This seems like a common thing to want to do so I am guessing that someone knows an easy, straightforward way to do it that is computationally efficient. Thanks. p

Negative 2994 pI need to write a validation to make sure that new records created in our application do not have duplicate names. Im told that validatesuniqueness will not work in this instance because the application already uses it to validate the creation of the original name. This validation will ensure that when the record is updated with a new name, that it too, is original...its sort of an antiscope validation. The query also needs to be case insensitive so I will need to write it using MYSQLs  UPPER function, which is why Ill need to use an array query and not a hash. p  pHeres a sketch of the pseudo code. p  pQuery the CUSTOMER database.  Check to ensure the UPDATEDRECORD to see if its NAME is unique.  If its NOT unique check to see if its ID belongs to record thats being updated.  If it is, thats OK as its the same ID and should be allowed to keep the same name. If the query finds the same name that has a different ID associated with it, then an error message should be displayed such as This Name is already in use by XXXX.p  pIm fairly new to Rails and have been having a bear of a time getting this structured correctly. p  pHeres some clarification on why I dont think validatesuniqueness will work here. p  pI think the issue is having multiple versions of the same record, as long as updated record is a new version of the same record it has the same record ID, then thats valid.  But if a new record version is updated with a name thats already used by an existing record with a different record ID, then that shouldnt be allowed. For example, having two term version records, recordid  100, name  Test amp recordid  100, name  Test, should be allowed since those two records are versions of the same term.  But having two records, recordid  100, name  Test amp recordid  201, name  Test, should not be allowed since that would result in two versions sharing the same name but associated with different terms.p

Is it doable I am using Blackfin and SHARC are from Analog Devices now and they are compatible with uCOS said on the uCOS website. In terms of testing tools, I think CUnit might work. Also we have a unit testing tool call EmbeddedUnit, which runs on VDSP development environment for Analog Devices processors. I have no experience with uCOS, but my understanding is we should compile it and then include the .obj files and the header files into the project then we can use and test the functions in uCOS.p  pAm I rightp
Negative 2994 pI am using WPF Datagrid and have a requirement to show 10,000 rows, hence need virtualization. From several articles on StackOverflow I see that virtualization  grouping is not possible with the WPF Datagrid. This is because the Expander template to render a group cannot be virtualized.p  pIn our system we may have 10,000 rows but only ever 3 or 4 are in each group. Also, the vast majority of rows are not grouped  they have a null GroupId. In a prototype I am working on these render as a group expander with no header. What Id ideally like is those to be not grouped, just rows, and the rest rendered inside an expander. Is this possiblep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.come3oNr.png altWPF Datagrid with Grouped and Ungrouped rowsp

Negative 2994 pI am currently researching a good reliable way of logging user actions on the computer. I created a simple app that hooks codeWHCBTcode events globally and it seems to work fine for now. Ive read about situations when an application wouldve their own codeWHCBTcode event handler and would not call codeCallNextHookExcode function after handling it. I assume that scenario would prevent me from handling any events in that application myself with a system wide hook.p  pIs there any other maybe better way to hijack keystroke events in applications Maybe something related to manually injecting a DLL to processes like thisp  ol liPick process.li liInject DLL using codeCreateRemoteThreadExcode.li liDLL hooks detours some winapi functions and gathers information from them about keystrokes or other events.li ol  pWould hooking codeGetMessagecode or codeTranslateMessagecode functions be enough in that case Am I right that any process using a Message Loop would have to use these functions in order to process events for created windowsp
Negative 2994 pOkay, Ill admit  the title is not the most descriptivehelpful but I couldnt really think of a better way to put it, which is probably also why I couldnt find an answer when I was searching.p  pBasically, Im making a basic MS Notepad like text editor and I want to add two JButtons to make a JTextAreas font Bold and Italic. I need someway of indicating whether the text is currently bold andor italic like in MS Office programs where the background of the buttons are orange when text is bold, italic or underlined  only I cant seem to change the background of the button. I think this is due to the fact that I am using the operating systems look and feel, but that information still doesnt solve my problem.p  pSo does anyone have any suggestions on how I can provide some feedback as to whether the text is bold andor italic through the JButton like in Microsoft Office Word Thanks in  advance.p

Im new to objective c and so am still treading water just a little bit.p  pIve got a protocol for which I want a generic implementationp  precodeprotocol SelectableElement ltNSObjectgt property BOOL selected end codepre  pIve got a couple of objects that I want to be selectablep  precodeinterface Widget  NSObject ltSelectableElementgt end  interface Duhicky  NSObject ltSelectableElementgt end codepre  pWhat Id like to do is to write the implementation of the protocol once, and make sure that both objects implement it that way.p  pI dont think that I can write a generic category and bind it to both, so I guess one way of doing it is to add implement the category on the common class NSObjectp  precodeimplementation NSObject Selectable  BOOLselectable      if [self conformsToProtocolprotocolSelectableElement] return      return YES  Use associative storage for this    voidsetSelectableBOOLselectable      if [self conformsToProtocolprotocolSelectableElement] return       set this associatively  end codepre  pOf course, I cant define a property variable to do this, I would need to use the associative object store... which Ive not demonstrated here.p  pIs this the only way of adding selectable behaviour generically to anything that implements the selectable element protocol Or is there a more obvious way that Im missingp  pI can of course use inheritance to implement this simple example, but that would only work for  implementing a single protocol in this way.  Is this approach that Ive suggested considered a natural fit, or is it a hackp  pJoep
Negative 2994 pI have a web app senchaphonegap that includes a feature allowing users to click on buttons that link to Wikipedia articles.  This obviously works fine if the device has internet access, but I get numerous requests to make the app work when the app is offline too.  To accomplish this, Id like to give the user the option to download the linked articleswebpages for offline access.  When the device does not have internet access, the app would instead display the saved version which might be staleoutofdate, but is better than nothing. What are possible ways to accomplish this task  p  pMy first thought was to somehow use the html manifest to cache the pages in the phones browser, which sounds possible on the Android browser, but iOS apparently has a 5MB browser cache limit  too small.p  pMy next thought was to save the needed html amp associated files and bundle them up inside the app.  But this seems a rather cumbersome approach, the app becomes much larger than it needs to be, and the webpages are stale back to the date the app was installed.p  pUsing javascript, is it possible to download webpages, which I could then save on the sd card, for example for access laterp  pOr is there a more elegant approachp  pIf anyone could point me in the right direction it would be much appreciated.p

Negative 2994 pIm writing a reusable Javascript snippet jQuery plugin that involves DOM CSS styling. Since its supposed to be usable by anyone, Id like to avoid conflicts between its CSS classes names and other existing classes on a document. Thats why Im using a namespace string as a prefix for all of its class names e.g. class codegridcode becomes codeprfxgridcode if my prefix is codeprfxcode. To respect DRY, and have it easily changeable, Id like to declare my prefix only once, and access it from both the CSS spreadsheet possibly using Sass and the Javascript code. If possible, Id also like to go on with only 2 files my .js and my .css.p  pIs there a way to declare such a prefixnamespace constant so it can be accessed from both SCSS and Javascript p

Provided that I would like to avoid waste of memory, should I design my codeOperationcode entity like thisp  precodepublic class Operation   here I have some doubts     private int id     private int workerId     private int customerId     other fields  codepre  por maybe like thisp  precodepublic class Operation   here I have some doubts     private int id     private Worker worker     private Customer customer     other fields  codepre  pp  pThe latter seems to be more emObject Orientedem but has one trivial implication the instances of worker and customer must be in memory, even if the clients of codeOperationcode may not need them.p  pEven worse if codeOperationDAOcode sets worker and customer as new Worker and Customer instances, this will lead to keep in memory emseveral instances referring to the same workercustomerem e.g. two operations performed by the same worker. Beside the waste of memory, this could definitely lead to eminconsistency of dataem e.g. one instance being modified without updating the others.p  pIn order to avoid this, there should be introduced some class that is aware of which instances are currently loaded e.g. using something like codeListltWorkergtcode, codeListltCustomergtcode, etc... and honestly this seems to me to be an overkill.p  pI also thought I could try to implement some kind of emlazy fetchingem, e.g. setting worker instance only at the first request, but still I would need some class that tracks what is in memory and what has to be queried I wouldnt even know if this class should be related to emData Access Logicem or to emBusiness Logicem Id guess the former but still not sure.p  pAnyway theres just no reason to implement all this, since I dont need a caching system and I feel like it would seem much like that.p  pAny suggestionp

Negative 2994 blockquote   pstrongPossible Duplicatestrongbr   a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions130322howdoyoupassamemberfunctionpointerHow do you pass a member function pointera  p blockquote    pSo Ive been writing some libraries for Arduino to trim down a rather large sketch Ive been working on. Everything is working so far, except for in the constructor in one of my classes. I use it to initialise any variables, pin modes and attaching interrupts.  The problems come in when I try to attach interrupts, I have the functions declared and defined in my class, and whether I attach them in the Arduino sketch in the setup block, or if I do it in my library in the constructor, I get this errorp  pargument of type void RotaryEncoders does not match void p  pThe basic structure of the code is as followsp  precodeRotaryEncodersRotaryEncoders       Initialise some variables      Set up some pin modes      attachInterrupt2, doRedEncoder, CHANGE   void RotaryEncodersdoRedEncoder       Some code, blah blah blah  codepre  pI assume that when you do this purely within the Arduino IDE, the tools do something to the functions in memory to make it work properly.

Negative 2994 pIm migrating an interface to a database from InfoPath to a .NET Web App in Visual Studio. The SQL Server database is set up that the user executes a single procedure, which kicks off other procedures, which kick off more procedures, etc. For the entire database to complete its procedures a model run, it takes about 30 minutes.p  pAt the end of each of these single procedures, a record is inserted into a table called sysProgressAudit. I want to bind this table to a gridview in an update panel, so that it can constantly refresh and the user can monitor the progress of the model run. However, since the databind is also a postback, Im afraid that I wont be able to synchronously refresh the gridview while the model is running since the original stored procedure wont have returned fully.p  pIs it possible to refresh an update panel constantly within any PageRequestManager events What do you think is the optimal solution to having a longrunning query and needed to refresh a table at the same timep  pI suppose I could kick off the query and not have it return anything the original InfoPath method, but Ill lose a lot of errorhandling and exceptioncatching functionality...p

Negative 2994 pIn my spring controllers, annotated with aspects, I am attempting to remove CGLib proxies and replace them with JDK dynamic proxies.

Below is the code I have so far. p  precode    goUp.hoverfunction          var curpos body.scrollTop       body.animatescrollTop curpos 200, 800     , function            I want to stop the animation here when they mouse out           goDown.hoverfunction          var curpos body.scrollTop       body.animatescrollTop curpos 200, 800     , function            I want to stop the animation here when they mouse out              codepre  pThanks for any help p

There is a default cancel bar button that appears on the top left hand corner of the navigation bar, which when clicked, gives me three options  delete draft, save draft, and cancel.  If I select delete draft, it does nothing except to return me to the compose message screen.  Is there a way for me to allow the user to return to the app after starting the compose mail function, but prior to sending it  Is there a way to add extra functionality to the cancel bar button to accomplish thisp  pThanks in advance to all who reply.p

Negative 2994 pIm writing an OpenGL ES 2.0 game in C running on multiple mobile platforms.

I have 3d and 2d parts in my scene and therefore need to render 2d without depthtest and 3d with depth test.li licurrently I enable depth test, draw 3d, disable depth test, draw 2dli libut still the computation takes 1820ms on the nexusli liI also checked if the depth buffer is cleared more than needed. But it is just cleared at the start of the frame.li ul  pIs it possible that the switch of the depth test takes that much timep  pDoes anyone have other ideas what can be checkedp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI found out that the 3d object I render is somehow responsible for the slow computation.p  ul liIf I remove the 3d object the performance is goodli libut the same 3d object is used in another scene without causing such troubleli liand the weirdest thing the Nexus runs Android 4.2 and it has an option in the developer options to visualize the cpu load as an overlay. If I enable this setting and start the game, the computation time is 56ms instead of 1820ms. How can this be relatedli ul

Here is an examplep  precodeBasic block 1     mov ecx, dword ptr [ecx]     test ecx, ecx     je 00401013h  Basic block 2     mov eax, dword ptr [ecx]     call dword ptr [eax08h]  Basic block 3     test eax, eax     je 0040100Ah  Basic block 4     mov edx, dword ptr [eax]     push 00000001h     mov ecx, eax     call dword ptr [edx]  Basic block 5     ret 000008h codepre  pNow I would like to group such basic blocks in functions  say which basic blocks form a function. Whats the algorithm I have to remember that there might be many coderetcode instructions inside one function. How to detect codefastcallcode functionsp

Negative 2994 pThere are many resources on how to remove duplicates and similar issues but I cant seem to be able to find any on removing unique elements. Im using SWIProlog but I dont want to use builtins to achieve this.p  pThat is, calling coderemoveunique[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6, 7], X.code should happily result in codeX  [2, 2, 7, 7]code. p  pThe obvious solution is as something along the lines ofp  precodecount, [], 0  . countE, [E  Es], A    S is A  1,   countE, Es, S. countE, [  Es], A    countE, Es, A.  isuniqueE, Xs    countE, Xs, 1.  removeuniqueL, R  removeuniqueL, L, R. removeunique[], , []  . removeunique[X  Xs], O, R    isuniqueX, O, ,   removeuniqueXs, O, R. removeunique[X  Xs], O, [X  R]    removeuniqueXs, O, R. codepre  pIt should become quickly apparent why this isnt an ideal solution codecountcode is codeOncode and so is codeisuniquecode as it just uses codecountcode. I could improve this by codefailcodeing when we find more than one element but worstcase is still codeOncode.p  pSo then we come to coderemoveuniquecode. For every element we check whether current element codeisuniquecode in codeOcode. If the test fails, the element gets added to the resulting list in the next branch. Running in codeOncode, we get a lot of inferences. While I dont think we can speed it in the worst case, can we do better than this nave solution The only improvement that I can clearly see is to change codecountcode to something that fails as soon as 1 elements are identified.p

Negative 2994 pIm working on a project based on the Laravel 4 framework. The framework is awesome, the website works great, no problem with that.p  pBut I also have to write several scripts, mostly DB maintenance tasks that will be scheduled in a crontab.p  pIm looking for a way to write these scripts in the same emflavourem as the website code. Or at least, reuse the models and if possible some other framework features.p  pIs there a way to do that  Thanks in advance p  pstrongAnswer  Artisan Commands are indeed the way to go. Everything you need to know about these is available in a hrefhttpfour.laravel.comdocscommands relnofollowthe Artisan Commands documentationa.strongp
Negative 2994 pI have stumbled upon an interesting MySQL Error message that I do not really know how to interpret. p  pThe setupp  ul liThere are two tables A and B.li liWhen data is written or updated in the table A, then a trigger is writing data to the table B.li liOperations happen on a Master databaseli liData is replicated to a slave serverli ul  pNow, whenever I decide to update data in table A, then it is updated and the corresponding log message is written to table B. MySQL, however, spawns the following error messagep  blockquote   pNote 1592 Unsafe statement written to the binary log using statement format since BINLOGFORMAT  STATEMENT. The statement is unsafe because it uses a LIMIT clause. This is unsafe because the set of rows included cannot be predicted.p      pNote 1592 Unsafe statement written to the binary log using statement format since BINLOGFORMAT  STATEMENT. Statement is unsafe because it invokes a trigger or a stored function that inserts into an AUTOINCREMENT column. Inserted values cannot be logged correctly.p      pNote 1592 Unsafe statement written to the binary log using statement format since BINLOGFORMAT  STATEMENT. Statements writing to a table with an autoincrement column after selecting from another table are unsafe because the order in which rows are retrieved determines what if any rows will be written. This order cannot be predicted and may differ on master and the slave.p blockquote  pNothing happy to the eye. How can I avoid thesep

Negative 2994 pIm trying to get callbacks on events in a kendo grid.  My coworker has already started creating the grid using the MVC helpers.  So Im trying to bind to the grid like thisp  precodeHtml.Kendo.GridltDetailViewModelgt         .Namedetails         .Eventsevents gt events.DataBoundlttextgtfunction                                               inputcheckbox.detailscheckbox.clickfunction                   console.logchecked                 handleChecked                          lttextgt codepre  pSo looking at the documentation, I dont know why I have to use the  tags here.  I thought I could just put in the name of my callback, like handleChecked.  That doesnt work though for me.  So I wrapped it in the  tag.  So the way it currently is setup, it does get the checked text to the console.  However, I actually want a method to be called when the checkbox is hit.  Id rather not have to put it in that function block since its going to get messy.  So what I tried doing is on document ready, define handleChecked.  That looks likep  precode Html.Telerik.ScriptRegistrar     .Scriptswa gt wa.AddSharedGroupUrl.AssetNameAssetGroups.SinglePageApps     .OnDocumentReady         lttextgt              document.readyfunction                              function handleChecked                  console.loghandle checked                            console.logdocument.ready                         lttextgt  codepre  pSo when I try to run it and click on a checkbox, I get handleChecked is undefined.  So Im not sure whats the best way to bind to a row in the kendo grid after the grid gets populated with the data.  Its getting rendered server side right now and I am trying to put a function callback to the DataBound event, but having some troubles.  Any thoughts  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 2994 pThe standard resize module with jQueryUI has a SE grip area for dragging east and south simultaneously, but it allows you to also just drag east or just drag south.

Negative 2994 pWhat is the best R idiom to compute sums of elements within a sliding windowp  pConceptually I want the followingp  precodefor i in 1lengthinput  lag  1   output[i] lt suminput[ii  lag  1] codepre  pIn other words, every output element should be the sum of a fixed number of input elements called codelagcode here, resulting in an appropriately shorter result vector. I know that I can theoretically write this asp  precodeoutput  diffcumsumc0, input, lag  lag codepre  pbut I am worried about the precision here. I have a setup in mind where all the values would have the same sign, and the vectors would be pretty large. Summing up the values up front might lead to prety large numbers, so there wont be many significant digits left for the individual differences. This feels bad.p  pI would imagine that it should be possible to do better than that, at least when using a single function instead of two. An implementation could maintain the current sum, aleays adding one element and subtracting another for each iteration. Since that would still accumulate rounding errors along the way, one could perform the computations separately from both ends, and if the results at the center were too far off, compute a fresh result from the center and thus increase precision in a divideandconquer approach.p  pstrongDo you know of any implementation which does anything like thisstrongbr Or is there a reason why this wont work as I think it shouldbr Or perhaps a reason why the codediffcumsumcode approach isnt as bad as it seemsp  hr  pemEditem I had some offbyone mistakes in my above formulations, making them inconsistent. Now they seem to agree on test data. codelagcode should be the number of elements summed, and Id expect a shorter vector as a result. Im not dealing with time series objects, so absolute time alignment is not that relevant to me.p  pI had seen some noisylooking things in my real data, which I had assumed to be due to such numeric problems. Since several different approaches to compute these values, using different suggestions from answers and comments, still led to similar results, it might be that the strangeness of my data is not in fact due to numeric issues.p  pSo in order to evaluate answers, I used the following setupp  precodelibraryRmpfr librarycaTools  len lt 102410248 lag lt 3 precBits lt 128 taillen lt 6  set.seed42  reproducible input lt runiflen input lt input  runiflen, min1e9, max1e9  use gt32 bits  optionsdigits  22   Reference sum everything separately using high precision. output lt mpfrrep0, taillen, precBits  precBits for i in 1taillen   output[i] lt summpfrinput[lentaillenilag1lentailleni],                         precBitsprecBits output  addResult lt functiondata, name    n lt crownamesresmat, name   r lt rbindresmat, as.numerictaildata, taillen   rownamesr lt n   assignresmat, r, parent.frame    reference solution, rounded to nearest double, assumed to be correct resmat lt matrixas.numericoutput, nrow1 rownamesresmat lt Reference   my original solution addResultdiffcumsumc0, input, laglag, diffcumsum   filter as suggested by Matthew Plourde addResultfilterinput, rep1, lag, sides1[laglengthinput], filter   caTools as suggested by Joshua Ulrich addResultlagrunmeaninput, lag, algexact, endruletrim, caTools codepre  pThe result for this looks as followsp  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecode                               [,1]                    [,2] Reference   2.380384891521345469556 2.036472557725210297264 diffcumsum 2.380384892225265502930 2.036472558043897151947 filter      2.380384891521345469556 2.036472557725210741353 caTools     2.380384891521345469556 2.036472557725210741353                                [,3]                    [,4] Reference   1.999147923481302324689 1.998499369297661143463 diffcumsum 1.999147923663258552551 1.998499369248747825623 filter      1.999147923481302324689 1.998499369297661143463 caTools     1.999147923481302324689 1.998499369297661143463                                [,5]                    [,6] Reference   2.363071143676507723796 1.939272651346203080180 diffcumsum 2.363071143627166748047 1.939272651448845863342 filter      2.363071143676507723796 1.939272651346203080180 caTools     2.363071143676507723796 1.939272651346203080180 codepre  pThe result indicates that codediffcodecodecumsumcode is still surprisingly accurate.

The button detects my mouse clicks to pixel perfect precision, and the texture2d is drawn faithfully to the detection box.p  pHowever, when I scale up to 1920 x 1080 same aspect ratio, the button is drawn in the incorrect locationp  precodecurrentwindowwidth  1920  The scale would be 1.5f here scale  currentwindowwidth  1280f b.position  new Vector2640, 650  scale b.origin  new Vector280, 40  scale spriteBatch.Drawb.texture, b.pos, null, Color.White, 0, b.ori, scale, SpriteEffects.None, 0 codepre  pThis will now give me a position vector of 960, 975 and an origin of 120, 60lt which I find in the Locals tab in visual studio. After doing some calculations these are the correct values, and the button detection works exactly where I want it to work. HOWEVER the sprite is not drawn in the correct location, it is drawn 60, 30 pixels offset from where it should be. When scaled up the button detection works in the correct location8401080, 9151035 but the texture2d is drawn in the wrong place. p  pThis happens as well when I scale the screen to another 169 resolution such as 1366 x 768, except not 60, 30 off but proportionally 8.0625, 4.03125 and 30, 15 at 1600 x 900. p  pThis effect is also witnessed when I use resolutions smaller than 1280 x 720 854 x 480, but in the opposite direction a positive offset vector instead of a negative one. p  pIn every 169 resolution the button detection works as calculated, but when I scale the texture2d it is drawn in the incorrect place. My only guess is that the scale scales the texture2d in ways I am not aware of.p  pIf anybody else has any experience on the issue I would much appreciate it,p  pKenp

Negative 2994 pIm using Storyboards in a new app Im making and have a tableview in most of my viewcontrollers, they are all set up almost identically to one another with a prototype cell, a unique cellidentifier, all UI aspects are pretty much the same.

The app is running flawlessly on iOS6 and the latest iOS7 beta, the problem is that 2 of the view controllers are crashing under iOS5.p  pThe crash bad access occurs in the following delegate method when calling codedequeueReusableCellWithIdentifiercode.p  precode UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      static NSString CellIdentifier  MoreCell     UITableViewCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierCellIdentifier]       Configure the cell...

As I said before they are all configured virtually identical, so it makes no sense for this crash to only occur on certain view controllers. I dont have autolayout ticked either so thats not a problem.p  pIf I create the cell the oldfashioned way prestoryboards, it works fine.

In doing this I have found the root cause of the problem  connecting a view to the cell for its codeselectedBackgroundViewcode. This exact view is being used in other tables in my app just fine, but on this particular one it causes a crash as above, and I have absolutely no idea why. I dont have any code that modifies it in anyway. Its just connected in the nib and thats it...p  pI can work around this by creating the selectedBackgroundView in code but I still dont understand whats different about this.p

Negative 2994 pI was experimenting with ways to capture screen on windows and consequently deciding on the fastest way to do so. The most common is obviously the GDI way.

Negative 2994 pIm new to Entity Framework. This is my first project using it.p  pIve created a new class that extends my merchant entity with new properties, which are mostly calculated totals. I could not figure out the best way to populate those new properties with data.

In the row there are 2blocks, aside and content which are codedisplaytablecellcode. In aside there is ul menu for whole app, in content there is currently shown content. Problem is, when i add image into content, whole menu in aside is pushed down by height of the immage. But image is in different block, it shouldnt be able to move with aside.p  pI made fiddle with problem, a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netCxREh2 relnofollowherea. As you can see, theres menu on left side in aside block, and image on the right. I put there at bottom of css file image with width 200px, you can change it to see the problem. With small values it do nothing, but with width around 50px it start to change the menu.p  pAny idea how to remove this effect, its driving me mad...p

Negative 2994 pI have three apps .NET, Android, Java.  The crypto involved consists of one of the three apps generating a message along with a key, IV, and salt to pass along to the other two.  .Net lt Android works perfectly for both asymmetric and symmetric encryptiondecryption, and the key generating functions outputting the same values.  The plain vanilla Java version is giving me problems.p  pThe key, iv and salt are generated using a RNG such asp  precodeKeyGenerator kg  KeyGenerator.getInstanceAES SecureRandom sr  SecureRandom.getInstanceSHA1PRNG kg.initlen  8, sr return kg.generateKey.getEncoded codepre  pwhich are then converted to a hex string to be passed along.

Negative 2994 pFollowing Problem Ive got a DataModel containing a list of objects and a reference to the selected object inside the List among other things Everything is working fine  if I select s.th. in the ListBox it is also available at the SelectedItem  if I change s.th. on the SelectedItem it gets updated in the whole DataModel.p  p..With one Exception though The Content of the ListBox is not updated. I suspect it has something to do with the DataTemplate, because I can observe the followingp  ul liif I change the SelectedItem the List of items in the DataModel gets updated accordingly checked on Debugger  also I always see the correct data on the selected item edit boxli liThe ListBox gets updated if I add an object from the list inside the DataModel, BUT also during this update I only get a new item in the ListBox the existing texts are not getting updated so the List actually reflects the data from the DataModelli liIf I reload the DataModel the whole ListBox gets rebuild and also the displayed Data is correct so there is nothing wrong with the Binding sourceli ul  pUpdate New Information available about the exact problemp  pThe Problem is actually some combination of Xsd2Code and ComplexType Extensions in XSD.

Each service is in fact a different shop, when a user enter my website, hes redirected to one of the shops and obviously, I must show him only movies available for his shop.

I cant really make changes to the db model.p  pI thought about a few solutions p  ul lipAdd the service condition into all my queries. Would work but its a bit cumbersome. The model is very complex and has tons of tablesqueries..pli lipUse nhibernate filter. Seemed ideal and worked pretty good, I added the filter on serviceid in all my mappings and did the EnableFilter as soon as my users service was recognized but.. nhibernate filtered collections dont work with 2nd lvl cache redis in my case and 2nd lvl cache usage is mandatory.pli lipAdd computed properties to my object like Movie.PublishedContentsInt32 serviceId. Probably would work but requires to write a lot of code and pollutes my domain.pli lipAdd new entities inheriting from my nhibernate entity like a PublishedMovie  Movie wich only presents the contextual datapli ul  pNone of these really satisfies me.

Negative 2994 pIm currently working on a PHP script, which uses pdo to access the database tables. Its just about done just trying to figure out this last thing. Im still relatively new to PHP, and probably could figure it out myself by looking around, I just have no idea what to look for.p  pIll tell you what I have, I have a table called servers. It has a column called location USA, CANADA, MEXICO, and EU are the values in each row. There is then another table for each location that corresponds to server table, USA, CANADA, MEXICO, and EU. Then in each table with the location has a column called SLOTS say the first row has 2, second has 3, etc. I want to get the sum of all of them and then put it into a variable, and then each of them will be displayed onto the same page. What I have now works fine, but I want to have it when more locations are added I dont have to go back and add it, itll get it from the location column in the servers table, and make it a bit cleaner then it is. I was looking into variable variables but not sure if itd work or how to get it working in this situationp  pWhat I have p  precodeusaresult  dbgtquerySELECT SUMSLOTS AS valuesum FROM USA usarow  usaresultgtfetchPDOFETCHASSOC usaslots  usarow[valuesum] ifissetusarow[valuesum]      usaslots  0   canadaresult  dbgtquerySELECT SUMSLOTS AS valuesum FROM CANADA canadarow  canadaresultgtfetchPDOFETCHASSOC canadaslots  canadarow[valuesum] ifissetcanadarow[valuesum]      canadaslots  0   mexicoresult  dbgtquerySELECT SUMSLOTS AS valuesum FROM MEXICO mexicorow  mexicoresultgtfetchPDOFETCHASSOC mexicoslots  mexicorow[valuesum] ifissetmexicorow[valuesum]      mexicoslots  0   euresult  dbgtquerySELECT SUMSLOTS AS valuesum FROM EU eurow  euresultgtfetchPDOFETCHASSOC euslots  eurow[valuesum] ifisseteurow[valuesum]      euslots  0  codepre  pHere is something that I was thinking of, doesnt work and is probably completely off, and probably something much better could be done, but should give an idea of what Im looking for, I thinkp  precodequery  SELECT  FROM servers  try        stmt  dbgtpreparequery      stmtgtexecute     result  stmtgtfetchAll   catchPDOException ex        dieFailed to run query  . exgtgetMessage    foreach result as row      row[location]result  dbgtquerySELECT SUMSLOTS AS valuesum FROM row[location]     row[location]row  row[location]resultgtfetchPDOFETCHASSOC     row[location]slots  row[location]row[valuesum]     ifissetrow[location]row[valuesum]      row[location]slots  0       codepre  pIf anyone could help me with this, or point me in the right direction, would be great.

Negative 2994 pI am working on a Windows Store Hub App using XAML and C.  I am not proficient in C.  I understand the basics.  Please go easy on me.  I know youre wondering why I would even attempt this and so am I at this point.  I come from a web design background and could have used Javascript.  But I have really learned a lot by doing it and googling what I didnt understand.  The app controls really made me jump through hoops to do anything I wanted to do which must not be anything anyone else wants to do or there would be more documentation.  I should also mention Ive never worked very much with forms so I dont have that background either.p  pI actually do have a question.  I am almost finished and on the last hub section.  I want to have textboxes that accept user input.  This will be for integers and will have a running total.  I can write that code albeit primitively.  What I cant do is access the textboxes inside the hub.  If I try to put them outside the hub I can but then they dont scroll with the page so I have textboxes floating there.p  pIf they werent in the hub I could just writep  precode private void ButtonClickobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e                   int a  Convert.ToInt32tbOne.Text            int b  Convert.ToInt32tbTwo.Text            int c  a  b            Total.Text  c.ToString        codepre  pOf course, it will be more complicated than that but that is the basic idea.  Inside the hub, it does not recognize the xname.p  pI would appreciate any insight into this or links if anyone has any.  I couldnt find anything by searching.p

Negative 2994 pI am a beginner at Sugarcrm currently and the documentation does not seem to help with the issue. My problem here is that I need to create an dependent droplist from an initial dropdown. So for example, if the initial dropdown was states, you could pick Florida, and then a second drop is a MULTISELECT in which you can select multiple cities in which you are from. I really do not know how to approach this problem. If you guys can help with this problem that would be great thanks p
Negative 2994 pIm given a text file daily. I need to do a couple things to the text file. p  ol lipI need to insert a line break every 181 characters. pli lipI need to read the text file line by line and send individual lines to new text files.  These files can contain different data types per line, which for my system is unusable. For example, I might get a file tomorrow that has 250 lines of data, containing 6 different data types. The data types are determined by the first four letters of the line. I need to read each line, and if the line starts with ABC1, send it to text file ABC1.txt. The next iteration and all lines that start with ABC1 need to be appeneded into the same ABC1.txt file. If the line starts with ABC2 send it to text file ABC2. pli ol  pIn the end I need to take originalfile.txt, and split it up into ABC1.txt, ABC2.txt, ABC3.txt, ABC4.txt. p  pIm new to programming and Im fiddling around with it. Currently I can open the file and read it, and I can print it to a new file. I havent figured out how to sort the lines into the lines I need, then send those to the new text file, then repeat that for the other file types. Ive done a lot of googling and watched a lot of videos but none seem to do what Im trying to do, theyre all pretty generic. p  pI would also like to figure out how to turn this fixed length document into a csv, but that would just be icing on the cake. p

Negative 2994 pIm creating three approved software lists for my company with SharePoint. One is the general list for all associates the next is the restricted list which will contain software like wireshark that only certain people should have access to and the last is the master list which will be a combination of the other two lists. p  pWhat would be ideal is being able to add the software to the master list and have it update the other two lists automagically. The unique key will of course be the software title. The field that will determine which list the row will be added to is the the [group] field.

I have to load many different JSON formatted strings like this, many are considerably larger and more complexp  precodeRSpec.describe DataGenerator do         describe createdata do          letinput        schema TESTSCHEMA,          tables [             name CASEINFORMATION,              rows 1,              columns [                 name caselocationid, type integer, initialvalue 10000, strategy next ,                 name id, type integer, deletekey true, initialvalue 10000, strategy next               ]                      ]                  it generates the correct number of tables do       generator  DataGenerator.newinput       expectgenerator.tables.size.to eq 1     end   end end codepre

Negative 2994 pI have a CodeIgniter system that can send messages to an app. The messages are sent as HTML and injected into a WebView in the app. However, on iOS, any links in the HTML cannot be clicked.p  pIve read that, for some reason, you have to manually add click event listeners to the links and call the fireEvent method with the url. If I want to do that, Id have to modify the HTML before it is returned from the server. How can I scan through the HTML as a string and insert onClick attributesp  pOr, is there a way to simply enable the app to open the links naturally, like Android does At this stage it doesnt matter if they open in the WebView or Safari.p

Negative 2994 pI have a Snap web app which serves some JS files and 1pixel images its main task is to rather work fast then serve huge htmlmedia content. There are several servers behind HAProxy.p  pI upgraded it from GHC 7.6 to 7.8, also upgrading some libs. After upgrade, app started leaking little by little on all servers, ending in OOM every 15 minutes on 8GBRAM machines and much longer on 16Gb and restarting afterwards.p  pThe problem is, if I compile app for profiling and run app for some time, I cant see any memory leaks anymore. It just consumes 1 CPU and works in constant small memory.p  pSo I wanted to ask for some general advices on how to find such a bottleneck, if running under profiling doesnt help much.p  pUPDATE I noticed after playing with an app that if I remove codeA100Mcode runtime option it doent OOM that fast, but with default value HAProxys sessions gets to its limit so, basically it chokes. Im playing with different RTS options now, hope some will help getting both, performance and longlived memory consumption.p  pUPDATE 2 just for the record, I found that with codeA30code rts option app, while being memory hungry, lives quite well. 8Gb machines OOMkill app, but 16Gb one looks like this a hrefhttpi.imgur.com3W9KpFS.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.com3W9KpFS.pnga green line is RAM available, you can see deployprocedure which restarted app on a graph. Im happy with the result, but would be glad to know any techniques to profile memory of multithreaded app anyway.p  pUPDATE 3 Im voting to close this question as too broad. In general, I see that if such generic set of tools thatll let you profile memory easier would exist, theyd definitely be documented elsewhere on wiki etc.p
Negative 2994 pHow can I use explicit waits using interns leadfoot API for functional testing in internp  pThere are multiple scenarios where I want to explicitly poll until a condition is met.

Negative 2994 pIve been using xTimerChangePeriod to perform LED animation on an ARM CortexM3 running freeRTOS. I have no access to PWM so thats why Im doing it with the timer task.p  pThe animation is essentially a timer callback that sets LED intensity at various interval. Between each callback, I use xTimerChangePeriod to change the delay to give the LEDs a fading in and out effect. However, I noticed that while often when specifying delays at 32ms the timer will happily give me a delay only 10ms off, sometimes it will get a hiccup a delay for 375ms I used the millisecond counter to measure this. p  pMaybe timer task is being blocked somewhere by other higher task Is there a way I can guarantee the timer delay to not be blocked for that longp
Negative 2994 pSorry for the TLDR, but I feel like it needs some explanation or it will be misunderstood.p  pI have a method that makes a call to generally external code which I expect to sometimes throw a RuntimeException, and uses futures which can throw InterruptedException or ExecutionException, and I want to be able to return an ordered set of returned values to from the call up until the exception was thrown, and the exception that was thrown. I wrote something that works, but unfortunately, the way the code looks makes me feel like Im doing something wrong.  What I think I really want is multicatch to be a more generic concept that.  That would allow pretty clean code to solve it, kind of like thisp  precodepublic class SomeResults    private final SetltSomeReturnTypegt valuesReturned   private final Nullable RuntimeException  ExecutionException  InterruptedException exception    public SomeResultsSetltSomeReturnTypegt valuesReturned, RuntimeException  ExecutionException exception      this.valuesReturned  valuesReturned     this.exception  exception       public SetltSomeReturnTypegt getValuesReturned      return valuesReturned       public Nullable  RuntimeException  ExecutionException  InterruptedException getException  codepre  pAnd have a method that wraps up making the calls to the external code ...p  precodegenerateResultsBar bar     Setup code   SetltSomeReturnTypegt valuesReturned  new LinkedHashSetltgt   ...    loop         stuff     ...   exceptions in this method should throw except for this one external code call     try        valuesReturned.addexternalCodeCallGetSomeReturnValuebar          catch RuntimeException  ExecutionException  InterruptedException e        return new MyResultsvaluesReturned, e          ...      return new MyResultsvaluesReturned, RuntimeException  ExecutionException  InterruptedException null  codepre  pAnd subsequently dop  precodeSomeResults myResults  foo.generateResultsnew Bar ifmyResults.getException  null    throwmyResults.getException  codepre  pEtc.  Note that I do note always want to immediately rethrow the exception  it depends on who is using these results what they will want to do with them.  I might do something likep  precodetry    SomeResults myResults  foo.generateResultsnew Bar   Foobar Foobar  new FoobarmyResults  catchException e     I dont want to see any exceptions from externalCodeCallGetSomeReturnValuebar here   ...  codepre  pOf course, I could let the exception get thrown in the function that generates results, instead of catching the exception and returning it as a result.  This has two pretty big issues 1. Now returning the set of values is going to be awkward  I could perhaps pass in a Set to the method that needs to return results and it modifies that set instead of returning a set.  That allows the set to be up to date when the exception is returned.  Egp  precodegenerateResultsBar bar, SetltSomeReturnTypegt orderedListForMeToWrite throws  ExecutionException, InterruptedException codepre  ol start2 liWhat if code surrounding the external method call throws a runtime exception  Now I have no easy way of distinguishing if the exception call was from the actual call to the external code, or something else  I actually ran into this issue when attempting this design.  The code threw IllegalArgumentException from somewhere else, and my code handling treated it as if it had been thrown from  SomeReturnType externalCodeCallGetSomeReturnValueBar bar.  This seemed like a code health issue, which is why I moved away from this solution.li ol  pThe solution I went with is to just store the exception as an Exception.  However, I hated losing that type information.  With no additional code work, if something wanted to throw it, it will have to declare throws Exception, which is not good, similar code health issues there.  Is there a good way to handle this situation  What I ended up doing to get it to work the way I wanted it to is as followsp  precode  public static class SomeResults      private final SetltSomeReturnTypegt orderedReturnValues     private final Nullable Exception exception      AsyncEchoesResultSetltSomeReturnTypegt responses        this.orderedResponses  responses       this.exception  null           AsyncEchoesResultSetltSomeReturnTypegt responses, RuntimeException exception        this.orderedResponses  responses       this.exception  exception           AsyncEchoesResultSetltSomeReturnTypegt responses, ExecutionException exception        this.orderedResponses  responses       this.exception  exception           AsyncEchoesResultSetltSomeReturnTypegt responses, InterruptedException exception        this.orderedResponses  responses       this.exception  exception           public SetltSomeReturnTypegt getResponses        return orderedResponses           public Nullable Exception getException        return exception           public void throwExceptionIfExists throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException        try          throw exception              catch RuntimeException  ExecutionException  InterruptedException e          throw e              catch Exception e          throw new RuntimeExceptionUnexpected exception type in SomeResults,e                codepre  pObviously, this is pretty ugly.  If I hate the constructors as they are I can easily enough replace them with a single one that takes an Exception, but that weakening the typechecking to only the runtime call of throwException. Anyway, are there alternatives that work better  Note that Im using with JDK 7 so while JDK 8 answers would be interesting, that wont fix it for what Im working on.p
Negative 2994 pHello amazing StackOverflow users, hope you can help me with some answers and opinions.p  pIm designing a system where Laravel 4 was chosen as framework. I faced problems trying to unit test due to the ActiveRecord complexity, which Laravel uses through Eloquent.p  pLooking at that I came across the Repository Pattern to be a good alternative and at the same time it also allows me to create my own set of libraries that can be easily detached and not dependent on the Framework.p  pWith that said, I started using it and it has allowed for nice unit test integration and use of IoC. I created my our own Plain Old Objects and within the repositories I map between the Eloquent model and these entitiesp  pstrongSo far so goodstrong, but now here are my two main problemsp  ul liA How to easily add Cachingli liB How to keep Caching consistency when multiple repositories are using the Eloquent modelsli ul  hr  h1For Ah1  pI was reading the Laravel documentation and some posts on the web, and it seems the that even when enabling caching memcache on the configuration file, the only way to actually use it is by creating a codeQueryBuildercode instance from the model, and then using the coderemembercode method.p  pBut this requires that every Repository that makes use of the model, creates a builder and developers remember to use the coderemembercode method.p  pAm I missing something Is there a better way for thisp  pThe only way I could think of, is to override the codenewBaseQueryBuildercode method on the Eloquent specific model and call the coderemembercode method before returning the instance, but feels kinda hacky.p  pemHowever, I noticed that performing Update operations wont clear the cache, so it feels quite useless, for caching data will potentially return no longer valid values.emp  hr  h1For Bh1  pIf I have multiple repositories that affect the same Model, since cache dont clear well, if we start using the codeCachecode Facade to handle caching separately, it will very quickly become unmanageable, unscalable and susceptible to bugs.p  pReading some posts and blogs a hrefhttpculttt.com20140203laravel4cacheservice relnofollowhttpculttt.com20140203laravel4cacheservicea and has some good ideas basically to use a strongDecorator Patternstrong so we make a Cachable implementation of the repository.p  pHowever, though this is a good idea, the issue comes with the problem stated on A, many repositories affecting the same model thus unmaintainable to handle the same cache value for an object consistently throughout different repositories.p  hr  pstrongHere is where I ask for solutions you may have thought of or implemented, as well as opinions on my following idea.strongp  h3Ideah3  ul liKeep using the Repository Pattern however, not make it implementation specific to the ORM, i.e. codeEloquentUserRepositorycodeli liUse the Data Access Object pattern to wrap the models.li liMy DAOs will in turn will provide an Eloquent specific implementation.li liUse the Decorator Pattern on the DAOs to provide the caching layer and because of the pattern, it allows me to also keep the Caching logic pretty centric, and loosely coupled.li liMake the Repositories use DAOsli lipUsing service providers, I could potentially have different caching mechanisms depending on the objects static data would use APC, while more volatile data will be on Memcache, and others maybe on Membase perhapsp  p.pli ul  pThank you for all your help and opinions.p

As I understand, viewWillLayoutSubviews is called, then AutoLayout is called, then viewDidLayoutSubviews is called. The resizing works, using the frame.origin.x and y. The problem I see, however, is that when the view is reloaded from a different view it appears as layed out on the storyboard, then moves to the new calculated position. Moving the logic into viewWillLayoutSubviews doesnt make a difference.p  pHow do you code repositioning the geometry of a UIView so that its calculated and positioned before appearing on screenp

Negative 2994 pIve been experimenting with displayinlineblock as an alternative to displayfloat. All the documentation Ive found says properties that can be normally applied to a block element can be applied to an inlineblock element. Specifically height, width, margin and padding are always listed.p  pSetting height and width certainly works for me  and I assume everyone else as well, since every example Ive found on the web explaining inlineblock sets one or both.p  pBut setting margin or padding appears to have no effect at all in either IE9 or Firefox 32.

Negative 2994 pI have just discovered interesting thing.  In BizTalk MSMQ send adapter you can set up Logon Info by providing User Name and Password to access the remote queue. But these properties User Name and Password do not exist in adapter class. I.e. when you construct message to be sent in orchestration you set up adapter properties, like this deliveryMsgMSMQ.BodyType  30 So there is no such things as User Name or Password properties in MSMQ adapter. This means you cannot specify a user you want to use for MSMQ dynamic port. Has anyone ever come across this issue I cant beleive Microsoft did not include these properties by mistake. Any solution for thatp  pThank you Jimmyp

But theres one thing that bugs the living hell out of me I just want to run the current filep  pIn Eclipse, the Run button was intelligent enough to simply run the current file if it contained a main method, and use the lastran file otherwise. But in IntelliJ, just running a file is much more complicated.

Negative 2994 pIm new to python and sockets and am trying to write an echoing clientserver socket.  I have written the server so that 30 of the packets are lost.

Negative 2994 pWe have a spring based Restful services in our application. The Restful services could be invoked from the web application or from a any other client like Postman or Curl. But, the URLs need to be authenticated irrespective of the client that is used to invoke the service. I am using codeDelegatingAuthenticationEntryPointcode to use codeLoginUrlAuthenticationEntryPointcode for authenticating when the request is from web application, and codeBasicAuthenticationEntryPointcode when the request is from Postman or Curl. The authentication process is triggered and successfully authenticated when the request is from web application, but if its from PostmanCurl the correct entry point is picked by codeDelegatingAuthenticationEntryPointcode but the authentication process is not trigerred. It keeps asking from the username and password again and again.

Negative 2994 pIve been writing a program that calls batch files which download some stuff. Ive added a label that reports the download progress to the user. The program is going to allow for multiple downloads so at some point the Label will be full of text. When that happens, the text extends from the label and I cant see any of it. What I want is to have the label scroll to the newer line of text added in the label. In other words I want to always have the focus of the label text to be on the last written line. Can some1 post an example that can do this on a label p

Negative 2994 pI have had a look online and some tutorials but i am struggling to understand the Sq lite stuff with updating users.p  pI will be making an android application in C using xamarin and i need to have a database attached and the users will add to it with various bits of information. So from what i have researched you can use SQlite which is basically a database thats sort of within the application not sure if that is correct. So should you use this over connection to MySQL remote database is it even possible to connect to remote databasep  pFinally how does the updating work with android applications, does the users application update every time more information is added to the SQLite database, i cant imagine it does so how does it do it i am just really confused on the subject at the minute and need some things clarifying.p  pcheersp

Negative 2994 pI have a table of recipes, and I want to show a weekly value for each of them. The values are votes cast for them. My problem is that I want to make an excellike table with all available fridays on my db, add a column for each recipe, and put its value for the friday on that column, if any value exists.p  pNow apparently the easiest join doesnt work so I wrote two queries one to get all ids for my recipes and one for the values to show. The first MySql query is just a select id from recipes, the second is like thisp  precodeselect d.date,perc from      SELECT date FROM weekly where YEARdate2014 group by date as d       left join weekly on d.date  weekly.date and weekly.idrec idrec codepre  pAny idea how to merge those two queries Running two queries makes everything slow down, but when I tried to merge them I didnt get the correct results.p  pData a hrefhttpsqlfiddle.com2b7d124 relnofollowsql fiddleap  pThe result should be something likep  precodeDates    Recipe A  Recipe B  ...

Negative 2994 pIm making a website for a customer where users can upload their CAD files to calculate a quote. Since DXF file format is the same of the DWG, I have choosen the DXFs one because its ASCII. The script is ready, but my customer wants also to upload DWG on the website. Now, I have found plenty of converters, but the job must be done on the website automatically when an user uploads his own files.

Negative 2994 pIm running a LAMP stack on Debian, with PHP and Python and trying to programmatically insert data into my MySQL database.

When autocommit is disabled, query statements are grouped into transactions that can be terminated by either commit or roll back mechanisms.li listrongmetadata.strong In this mode, a connections database is able to provide metainformation describing its tables, its stored procedures, and so on. Each instance of the metadata object will have a particular query associated with it. The metadata object will execute that query and cache the results.li listrongtable.strong This method requires the Web server to perform a query on a userspecified table.li ul  pFor autocommit it seems fairly explanatory, however I am not sure how the other two mechanisms work. p  pIn particular for table validation, what kind of query is used is it just a simple SELECT  FROM TABLE or is it even more simpler than thatp  pShould I create a basic table for use in this validation with 1 row and 1 columnp  pWhat is the best performing method of validationp  pstrongBonus questionstrong Why can my Servlet not force the web server to reset all JDBC connections in the pool.

The idea behind, this is to free the application in the remote machine from handling requests from users who want to view the media. This tomcat application sitting in another machine like yy.yy.yy.yy will serve the requests of displaying the media which is being processed in the remote machine xx.xx.xx.xxp  pCan this be done  If yes, what configuration changes do I need to do p

Negative 2994 pI got UIPageViewController working finally a few days ago. I am using different UITableViewControllers as the pages. There is a slight problem that i have that i want to fix.p  pWhen i scroll, the view is empty until fetches the new data which i dont like. I would like the data to be loaded before scrolling so it goes swiftly. So the question is If i can load the next page somehow before scrolling.p  pI thought of a way to fix this in an ugly way by calling the fetch function somewhere before and save the dictionary in  strongNSUserDefaultsstrong so when the view loads for the first time the data is already loaded and can be used. p  pAny other ideas of how this can be done the right wayp

Negative 2994 pSuppose the JPA provider is hibernate.  Suppose it is not container managed, but application managed.p  pGiven an entity class and correct annotation, is it possible to create table programatically, at runtime, and only for that class  By saying runtime, it means the entity class is not listed in the persistence.xml.p  pTheoretically, it is possible because we can manually read the annotations and generate SQL, and from the persistence unit we can read database connection url.  My question is, is there anyway to do it without duplicating lots of work inside hibernatep  pI found in other SO questions that codePersistence.createSchemacode could be used, but I dont see where to specify the class.p

Negative 2994 pContinuing to work on my port of a CakePHP 1.3 app to 3.0, and have run into another issue. I have a number of areas where functionality varies based on certain settings, and I have previously used a modular component approach. For example, Leagues can have roundrobin, ladder or tournament scheduling. This impacts on the scheduling algorithm itself, such that there are different settings required to configure each type, but also dictates the way standings are rendered, ties are broken, etc. This is just one of 10 areas where I have something similar, though not all of these suffer from the problem below.p  pMy solution to this in the past was to create a LeagueComponent with a base implementation, and then extend that class as LeagueRoundRobinComponent, LeagueLadderComponent and LeagueTournamentComponent. When controllers need to do anything algorithmspecific, they check the scheduletype field in the leagues table, create the appropriate component, and call functions in it. This still works just fine.p  pI mentioned that this also affects views. The old solution for this was to pass the league component object from the controller to the view via codethisgtsetcode. The view can then query it for various functionality. This is admittedly a bit kludgy, but the obvious alternative seems to be extracting all the info the view might require and setting it all individually, which doesnt seem to me to be a lot better. If theres a better option, Im open to it, but Im not overly concerned about this at the moment.p  pThe problem Ive encountered is when tables need to get some of that component info. The issue at hand is when I am saving my addedit form and need to deal with the custom settings. In order to be as flexible as possible for the future, I dont have all of these possible setting fields represented in the database, but rather serialize them into a single custom column. Reading this all works quite nicely with a custom constructor and getters. I had previously done this by loading the component from the beforeSave function in the League model, calling the function that returns the list of schedulespecific settings, extracting those values and serializing them. But with the changes to component access in 3.0, it seems I can no longer create the component in my new beforeMarshal function.p  pI suppose the controller could pass the component to the table by setting it as a property, but that feels like a major kludge, and there must be a better way. It doesnt seem like extending the table class is a good solution, because that would horribly complicate associations. I dont think that a hrefhttpbook.cakephp.org3.0enormdatabasebasics.htmladdingcustomdatabasetypes relnofollowcustom typesa are the solution, as I dont see how theyd access a component either. Im leaning towards passing just the list of fields from the controller to the model, thats more of a configuration method. Speaking of configuration, I suppose it could all just go into the central Configure data store, but thats always felt to me like somewhere that you only put small data. Im wondering if theres a better design pattern I could follow that would let the table continue to take care of these implementation details on its own without the controller needing to get involved if at some point I decide to change from the serialized method to adding all of the possible columns, it would be nice to have those changes restricted to the table class.p  pOh, and keep in mind that this list of custom settings is needed in both a view and the table, so whatever solution is proposed will ideally provide a way for both of them to access it, rather than requiring duplication of code.p

Negative 2994 pI want to know strongifstrong and stronghowstrong it is possible to use an other clientside validation framework than jquery validate, eg.

It seems that asp.net mvc have too many static classes e.g. HtmlHelper which makes it nearly impossible to extend some functionality without rewriting a lot of frameworkcodep  pThe power of common data annotations is cool to descibe meta information about the data. Its used by Entity Framework and MVC, but the clientside validation should be limited to jquery validatep  pI know, that I can configure clientvalidation frameworks like parsley to get used with an other prefix like the dataval of jquery validate instead of dataparsley, but not all features can be used this way and conflicts are possible.p  pHope anyone have an answer for me p

Negative 2994 pI have started to build my C application with Visual Studio 2015 and notice that some parts of the application runs way slower when compiled with VS2015 compared to when it is built with Visual Studio 2013 on the same computer. The application targets .NET 4.5.2 and I run Windows 10.p  pI assume that since I have Visual Studio 2015 installed, even the application built with VS2013 will use the .NET 4.6 runtime, i.e. the runtime environment for both applications will be the same. Is this a correct assumptionp  pIf the runtime environment is equal for both my application instances, I would think that there are something in the compiler andor the code generation that causes the slowdown. If so, do anyone have any suggestions on e.g. known issues regarding C code generation in Visual Studio 2015p  pRegards, Leifp

Negative 2994 pI am trying to write a simple app where a text file is read and the two values stored in the file are read and printed. The int values can then be increased through the use of buttons. I have tried using file input and output streams to write and read files but I cannot find a way for the file to be read when the app is opened so the count can remain correct when the app is closed. Any help would be very appreciated. Thank you so much.p
Negative 2994 pI have created the WCF service and i am calling that service reference in my client code by adding in Service references of my client.

Negative 2994 pI am trying to debug a simple DropWizard application in Eclipse, in an attempt to familiarise myself with it. I can start the jvm from the command line like thisp  precodejava Xdebug agentlibjdwptransportdtsocket,address9999,servery,suspendn jar dropwizard0.0.1SNAPSHOT.jar server config.yaml codepre  pAnd then connect to it as a remote java app.p  pOr I can find the application class containing the main method in eclipse and launch the application in debug that way. Both these methods appear to successfully start the application in debug, and sure enough, if I set a break point somewhere, it gets hit.p  pMy problem, however, is that Eclipse would normally at this point give me some control over the application but in this case is rather oddly not allowing me to resume, or use any step commands. I cant do anything other than terminate the application.p  pPerhaps I am having a stupid morning, but I cannot fathom why this is happening.  Can anyone shed any light on this and how I can gain the control required to debugp
