Positive 292 pI have an ASP .Net 4.5 MVC website where I have customized the forms authentication following a hrefhttpwww.dotnettricks.comTutorialmvcG54G220114CustomAuthenticationandAuthorizationinASP.NETMVC.html relnofollowthis tutoriala.

I would also like to use my SPA as a mobile app with the help of Cordova. The obvious pitfall here is that if I use cookies, there is no bakedin cookie supportstorage with Cordova and Im urged to switch to HTML5 local storage instead. Since on mobile I dont really need to worry about refreshing pages, I can just let my token live in memory and expire with the strategy I settle on.p  pIf I take this approach, cookiebased JWT on Desktop, Bearer headers on mobile, I now need an authentication endpoint that will give tokens two different ways, and when I authorize on the REST API side, I need to support both cookiebased JWTs with CSRF and header based JWT verification. This complication has me worried as I dont know if I can accurately foresee security implications here.p  pTo summarize the barrage of thoughts abovep  ul liCreate an authentication handler that would hand out tokens via HttpOnlySecure cookies to desktop, and by payload for mobile.li liOn my REST API, support both methods of verification  header based and cookiebased  including CSRF protection for the cookiebased approach.li ul  pstrongIs there any reason why I wouldnt want to take this approachstrong I assume if I take XSS on my SPA as a serious risk, then I need a classic loginpage for authentication to set the proper cookies because if I do authentication via the SPA, then any XSS attack could potentially intercept that as well both on mobile and Desktop However, on mobile, Id need to inject the JWT into SPA, maybe through some custom DOM element meta tag, but at that point I can just let the SPA perform the login and not consider XSS a threat on mobile devices. Cordova packages all assets into the install package so thats somewhat better but then why not take the same approach on the Desktop versionp  pMy application takes very little user input, it is primarily a dashboardreporting tool. There will be a message center but its content should always be usercreated by only that user and sanitized. strongIn my usecase then, would it be ok to deviate from best practices and rely on localStorage not counting XSS as a serious risk for my SPAstrong This would simplify this entire thing use HTML5 sessionStorage as originally planned and reduce complexity, which would reduce attack surface for potential security blunders. I just want to make sure I understand the risks before moving forward.p  pstrongIs there no secure way to make this secure other than by building a native app for mobile and not using Cordova to convert my SPA to a mobile appstrong Id hate for this to be the case, but it might very well be. p  pId appreciate all thoughts on the matterp

Negative 292 pAlright, I think we all agree that what happens with the following code is undefined, depending on what is passed,p  precodevoid deleteForMeint pointer       delete[] pointer  codepre  pThe pointer could be all sorts of different things, and so performing an unconditional codedelete[]code on it is undefined. However, lets assume that we are indeed passing an array pointer,p  precodeint main       int arr  new int[5]      deleteForMearr      return 0  codepre  pMy question is, in this case where the pointer strongisstrong an array, who is it that knows this I mean, from the languagecompilers point of view, it has no idea whether or not codearrcode is an array pointer versus a pointer to a single int. Heck, it doesnt even know whether codearrcode was dynamically created. Yet, if I do the following instead,p  precodeint main       int num  new int2      deleteForMenum      return 0  codepre  pThe OS is smart enough to only delete one int and not go on some type of killing spree by deleting the rest of the memory beyond that point contrast that with codestrlencode and a noncode0codeterminated string  it will keep going until it hits 0.p  pSo whose job is it to remember these things Does the OS keep some type of record in the background I mean, I realise that I started this post by saying that what happens is undefined, but the fact is, the killing spree scenario doesnt happen, so therefore in the practical world emsomeoneem is remembering.p

Or, if I detect that there are multiple CPU cores, I could just give each task to a separate thread and all would be well.p  pThe second solution does have the advantage of adapting to the number of available CPU cores, but will the manual taskswitch really be faster than the one in the OS core Especially if Im trying to make the whole thing generic with a codeTaskManagercode and an codeITaskcode, etcp  pstrongClarificationstrong Im a Windows developer so Im primarily interested in the answer for this OS, but it would be most interesting to find out about other OSes as well. When you write your answer, please state for which OS it is.p  pstrongMore clarificationstrong OK, so this isnt in the context of a particular application. Its really a general question, the result on my musings about scalability. If I want my application to scale and effectively utilize future CPUs and even different CPUs of today I must make it multithreaded. But how many threads If I make a constant number of threads, then the program will perform suboptimally on all CPUs which do not have the same number of cores.p  pIdeally the number of threads would be determined at runtime, but few are the tasks that can truly be split into arbitrary number of parts at runtime. Many tasks however can be split in a pretty large constant number of threads at design time. So, for instance, if my program could spawn 32 threads, it would already utilize all cores of up to 32core CPUs, which is pretty far in the future yet I think. But on a simple singlecore or dualcore CPU it would mean a LOT of context switching, which would slow things down.p  pThus my idea about manual task switching. This way one could make 32 virtual threads which would be mapped to as many real threads as is optimal, and the context switching would be done manually. The question just is  would the overhead of my manual context switching be less than that of OS context switchingp  pNaturally, all this applies to processes which are CPUbound, like games. For your runofthemill CRUD application this has little value. Such an application is best made with one thread at most two.p
Negative 292 pI was suggested when I have some further questions on my older ones, to create newer Question and refer to old one. So, this is the original question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2766233whatisthecruntimelibraryWhat is the C runtime libraryap  pOK, from your answers, I now get thet statically linked libraries are Microsoft implementation of C standard functions. Nowp  pIf I get it right, the scheme would be as follow I want to use printf, so I must include codeltstdio.hgtcode which just tells compiler there is a function printf with these parameters. Now, when I compile code, because printf is defined in C Standard Library, and because Microsoft decided to name it C Run Time library, it gets automatically statically linked from libcmt.lib if libcmt.lib is set in compiler at compile time. I ask, becouse on wikipedia, in article about runtime library there is that runtime library is linked in runtime, but .lib files are linked at compile time, am I rightp  pNow, what confuses me. There is .dll version of C standard library. But I thought that to link .dll file, you must actually call winapi program to load that library. So, how can be these functions dynamically linked, if there is no static library to provide code to tell Windows to load desired functions from dllp  pAnd really last question on this subject  are C Standard library functions also calls to winapi even they are not .dll files like more advanced WinAPI functions I mean, in the end to access framebuffer and print something you must tell Windows to do it, since OS cannot let you directly manipulate HW. I think of it like the OS must be written to support all C standard library functions same way across similiar versions, since they are statically linked, and can differently support more complex WinAPI calls becouse new version of OS can have adjustements in the .dll file.p

Negative 292 pSo, Im new to dynamic web design my sites have been mostly static with some PHP, and Im trying to learn the latest technologies in web development which seems to be AJAX, and I was wondering, if youre transferring a lot of data, is it better to construct the page on the server and push it to the user, or is it better to pull the data needed and create the HTML around it on the clientside using JavaScriptp  pMore specifically, Im using CodeIgniter as my PHP framework, and jQuery for JavaScript, and if I wanted to display a table of data to the user dynamically, would it be better to format the HTML using CodeIgniter create the tables, add CSS classes to elements, etc.., or would it be better to just serve the raw data using JSON and then build it into a table with jQuery My intuition says to do it clientside, as it would save bandwidth and the page would probably load quicker with the new JavaScript optimizations all these browsers have now, however, then the site would break for someone not using JavaScript...p  pThanks for the helpp
Negative 292 pI am trying to read the value of an enum in an annotation using an annotation processor and annotation mirror, but I am getting back null.

And due to Microsofts anemic documentation see my link, theres no remarks or code examples Im having trouble making heads or tails of the difference between two methodsp  pSetOutputToAudioStream and SetOutputToWaveStream.p  pHeres what I have deduced p  pSetOutputToAudioStream takes a stream and a SpeechAudioFormatInfo instance that defines the format of the wave file samples per second, bits per second, audio channels, etc. and writes the text to the stream.p  pSetOutputToWaveStream takes just a stream and writes a 16 bit, mono, 22kHz, PCM wave file to the stream. There is no way to pass in SpeechAudioFormatInfo.p  pMy problem is SetOutputToAudioStream doesnt write a valid wave file to the stream. For example I get a InvalidOperationException The wave header is corrupt when passing the stream to System.Media.SoundPlayer. If I write the stream to disk and attempt to play it with WMP I get a Windows Media Player cannot play the file... error but the stream written by SetOutputToWaveStream plays properly in both.

Negative 292 pIm wondering if its possible to have an instance of an codeAVCaptureSessioncode and codeUIImagePickercode both accessing the camera simultaneously.p  pI want to create an app that shows an ambient light meterindicator as an overlay view of a codeUIImagePickercode when the camera is active.

In my experimentation, codeAVCaptureSessioncode seems to become suspended when codeUIImagePickercode displays the camera view. Any ideas Thanksp

Negative 292 pHey guys.  Im designing a site that uses the Icefaces framework.  Ive been reading a book called Real World Java EE patterns.  Im kind of confused how to layout the pages.  Normally I would have just a POJO class implement serializable for a bean.  This bean would then back each page.  With a single page design Im going to have a bunch of elements on the page.  Datatables, trees, inputs, calendars etc.  Is it normal or best practice to have separate beans for each datatable, calendar, etc or put that all in one bean  Im not sure how to approach this.  Right now each element is a bean and Im using the Inject annotation to have the data table talk to the tree and vise versa.  This creates really bad code and if I put this as a member of the class I will get a circular reference because the data table bean has to inject the calendar and the calendar has to inject the data table.  p  pThanks for any help.p

Negative 292 pI am trying to use SNMP4J to do a SNMP bulkget.  When ever I use SNMP4J to make the call I get returned a responseEvent error that says General Variable Binding error and the data returned is equal to Null.p  pTo debug I print out, to the console, the exact OID and version number that I am using in SNMP4J. I then use the printed out data to do an snmpwalk on the command line. But I get back valid results.  So I know I am sending SNMP4J the correct pdu with the correct OID, version number, max repititions, etc.p  pI have used SNMP4J and this code I wrote succesffuly to monitor other devices for years.  So I dont know what is different this time. So this is leaving me stumped. Why would I get back general variable binding error  What causes that error Ideas to debugp

The widget is still there  one can click on it, the dropdown box expands as normal  but Firefox, in rendering the background colour red, loses the actual downarrow symbol.p  pAfter making another selection in the dropdown box Firefox rerenders the element and the symbol pops back again, everything looking normal.p  pIve got this little sample page to illustrate the problemp  precodelthtmlgt      ltheadgt           lttitlegtShowing weird bug with select background colour changelttitlegt      ltheadgt       ltbodygt           ltselect idtestselect onchangeselectchangedthisgt                ltoption valueone selectedselectedgtoneltoptiongt                ltoption valuetwogttwoltoptiongt                ltoption valuethreegtthreeltoptiongt                ltoption valuefourgtfourltoptiongt           ltselectgt            ltscriptgt                                      change ltselectgt to red background unless its value is one                                lastval  one                 function selectchangedelement                      var currentval  element.value                      if currentval  lastval                           element.style.backgroundColor  currentval  one    FF8888                          lastval  currentval                                                ltscriptgt       ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pThe option one is supposed to be the default background colour any other option is red.p  pMaking a transition from one to the other causes the javascript to set the background colour of the codeltselectgtcode element to either codeFF8888code or .p  pIf the dropdown box is looking normal with one selected and you select two youll see  in Firefox  that the element will turn red but the symbol thingie will disappear.

Negative 292 pFor a while I have been thinking about how to deal with objects which are assigned identifiers by the database.p  pA typical object representing a table entity may look likep  precodepublic class Test      public int Id  get private set      public string Something  get set   codepre  pSuppose we would like to use this object for inserting, retrieving and updating objects in the database. As for retrieving and updating we have no problems, since the Id field always has a value.p  pHowever, if we want to insert a new object of type Test into the database, the Id field will still need to have a value. We could just use 0, as it is unlikely to be used as a database key, but really this is not a good design.p  pLikewise, if we invert the situation and make the Id property nullable, we could use null for objects which have not yet been assigned an identifier by the database. However, it is now possible for an object retrieved from the database to not have an identifier as allowed by the class design, but not the database designp  pAny good ideas on how to make a good design for this problemp

Negative 292 pEmacs 24 now has lexicallyscoped variables. It also still has dynamicallyscoped variables, of course. Now that it has both, Im quite confused about when a variable will have which kind of scope. Theres a codelexicalbindingcode variable that controls when lexical binding is enabled, and I think I read something about codedefvarcode now declaring a dynamicallyscoped variable, but in general Im pretty lost. Is there a good explanation somewhere of Emacs 24s new scoping rules Or put another way, when I look at a variable in Emacs Lisp code written for Emacs 24, how do I tell what scope that variable is usingp

Negative 292 pIm pretty new to manually manipulating images, so please bear with me.p  pI have an image that Im allowing the user to shrinkgrow and move around.p  pThe basic behavior works perfectly. However, I need to be able to grab whatever is in the viewport visible clipping region rectangle and save it out as a separate bitmap.p  pBefore I can do this, I need to get a fix on WHERE the image actually is and what is being displayed. This is proving more tricky than I would have imagined.p  pMy problem is that the Matrix documentation is absurdly vague, and Im lost as to how I can measure the coordinates and dimensions of my transformed image.  As I see it, the X,Y of the image remain constant even as the user shrinksgrows it.  So, even though it reports at being at 0,0 its displayed at say 100,100.  And the only way I can get those coordinates is to do a fairly ugly computation again... Im probably not doing it the most elegant way, since geometry is not my forte. p  pIm kind of hoping that Im missing something and that theres some way to pull the objects auto translated coordinates and dimensions. p  pin an ideal world I would be able to call pseudo codemyImg.getDisplayedWidthcode and codemyImg.getDisplayedXcode.p  pOh, and I should add that this may all be a problem that Im causing myself by using the center of the image as the point from which to growshrink.  If I left the default 0,0 coordinate as the non changing point, I think the location would be correct no matter what its size was.  So... maybe the answer to all this is to simply figure out my center offset and apply that to my translationsp  pAll help greatly appreciated and people not arbitrarily messing with my questions title even more so.p

Negative 292 pI have a big table that has many columns. In different use cases I need to load different columns from this table, but usually I dont need all of the columns.

Negative 292 pI have been programming in C for a while but I am a beginner to network programming and I am unclear on a couple of things so this is a three part question.p  ol lipIn example applications, I have seen a call to send on one socket, a check of its return value, and then immediately after, a call to recv on the same socket. I find this confusing however as recv is not called until after send so is there not a risk that a reply message will arrive before recv is called If so is this actually a problem or will the message just hang in limbo until recv is called and it is receivedpli lipI wish to write a class which communicates with a server, and can make several different kinds of request to the server, with one function for each which sends a request then waits for a reply. My client will have an instance of this class as a member. Given that send and recv are blocking calls, even if I create a seperate thread for network communications how can I stop all network communications from being halted while waiting for a reply to one request If one message fails then until sendrecv times out I wont be able to make any more requests, so do I need more than one socket per client More than one threadpli lipI have been reading about thread safety, and given that send and recv are blocking calls I assume that my application will be threadsafe if I only have one thread per client for network communications, however if I do need more than one thread or more than one socket for each client which I dont know yet, how will I go about making it thread safepli ol  pSorry this was so long. Thanks.p

Negative 292 pI have implemented a searchfunction in my sourcecode which will be started when the user clicks the searchbutton on his device or the one in my actionbar. If he clicks the one on my actionbar I simply call codeonSearchRequestedcode. Now here is my problemp  pWhen the Search is done I display the results in a ListView. If the user clicks on an Item I want do go back to my codeMainActivitycode which will always exist when the app isnt finished and modify some values there und call a method of Main. p  pI know that there is codestartActivityForResultcode but I dont know how I could implement that because if the User hits the search button of his device the app automatically calls codeonSearchRequestedcode... So the only solution that comes to my mind would be to implement a static method in my MainActivity which I can call from within the Activity displaying my search results. But that isnt such a nice solution orp  pTo summarize my question is there an elegant way to get back from my activity displaying my search results to my mainactivity and transfer data without codestartActivityForResultcode or implementing a static method in Mainp  pThank u very muchp

Now a step further, what if they wanted to find all the cards in say Color White and Blue from the Kings set, I would like to be able to click and select the White and Blue Button plus the button that says Kings, then hit submit, this then returns the results for all cards in the Kings Set that are White and Blue and displays the results in a new window that they can click on the name and it will brign up another window with all the info on that cardp  pI know it is a lot of info, any helpp

Negative 292 pConsiderp  precodetry     fargs, kwargs except TypeError     print doh codepre  pThe reason for codeTypeErrorcode in this case could a problem in function arguments, e.g. codef got an unexpected keyword argument bcode. However, codeTypeErrorcode could also be raised due to a problem within the function body itself, e.g. codelist indices must be integers, not strcode.p  pstrongI wonder if there is a solid way in Python 2 in order to distinguish both cases problem with arguments, problem in body.strong Maybe some decoratorbased approachp  pReasoning I am implementing just another kind of job system. A job basically is a function. The arguments to this function could be derived from user input and go through a JSON serializationdeserialization process. I want the system to provide as exact error messages as possible to the user of the system. Hence, I would like the entity that controls job execution to be able to distinguish both sources of codeTypeErrorcode. Furthermore, I think this a very interesting problem itself.p  pI realize that a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12712475howtocheckifatypeerrorraisedfrommismatchedfunctionargumentsHow to check if a TypeError raised from mismatched function argumentsa basically is a duplicate of this question.

Negative 292 pWe are evaluating Meteor for our new generation of enterprisescale system. One of the amazing builtin features is that  every data model in the client is bound to the model in the database and is updated once the server updates. but Im concerned about the scalability. p  pWhat would be the architecture needed to invalidate millions of connected users p  pI guess the basic question is how the database is bound to the model on the server and client.  Extrapolating more, lets say we have multiple webservers running, and one database. Is it supported If so, how  If anyone could describe the underlying technology that made it happen, it would help a lot. p  pI guess this could be a general question for scaling of any web app that uses a reactive model.

Negative 292 pApologies, in advance, if this seems like a duplicate question. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2075754This questiona was the closest I could find, but it doesnt really solve the issues I am facing.p  pIm using Entity Framework 5 in an ASP.NET MVC4 application and attempting to implement the Unit of Work pattern.p  pMy unit of work class implements codeIDisposablecode and contains a single instance of my codeDbContextcodederived object context class, as well as a number of repositories, each of which derives from a generic base repository class that exposes all the usual repository functionality. p  pFor each HTTP request, Ninject creates a single instance of the Unit of Work class and injects it into the controllers, automatically disposing it when the request is complete.p  pSince EF5 abstracts away the data storage and Ninject manages the lifetime of the object context, it seems like the perfect way for consuming code to access inmemory entity objects without the need to explcitly manage their persistence. In other words, for optimum separation of concerns, I envisage my controller action methods being able to use and modify repository data without the need to explicitly call codeSaveChangescode afterwards. p  pMy first naiive attempt to implement this idea employed a call to codeSaveChangescode within every repository baseclass method that modified data. Of course, I soon realized that this is neither performance optimized especially when making multiple successive calls to the same method, nor does it accommodate situations where an action method directly modifies a property of an object retrieved from a repository.p  pSo, I evolved my design to eliminate these premature calls to codeSaveChangescode and replace them with a single call when the Unit of Work instance is disposed. This seemed like the cleanest implementation of the Unit of Work pattern in MVC, since a unit of work is naturally scoped to a request.p  pUnfortunately, after building this concept, I discovered its fatal flaw  the fact that objects added to or deleted from a codeDbContextcode are a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6990618not reflected, even locallya, until codeSaveChangescode has been called.p  pSo, what are your thoughts on the idea that consuming code should be able to use objects without explicitly persisting them And, if this idea seems valid, whats the best way to achieve it with EF5p  pMany thanks for your suggestions,p  pTimp  pUPDATE Based on Wahids response, I am adding below some test code that shows some of the situations in which it becomes essential for the consuming code to explicitly call codeSaveChangescodep  precodevar unitOfWork  kernel.GetltIUnitOfWorkgt var terms  unitOfWork.Terms.Entities   Purge the table so as to start with a known state  foreach var term in terms      terms.Removeterm   unitOfWork.SaveChanges  Assert.AreEqual0, terms.Count   Verify that additions are not even reflected locally until committed. var created  new Term  Pattern  Test  terms.Addcreated Assert.AreEqual0, terms.Count   Verify that additions are reflected locally once committed. unitOfWork.SaveChanges Assert.AreEqual1, terms.Count   Verify that property modifications to entities are reflected locally immediately  created.Pattern  Test2 var another  terms.Singleterm gt term.Id  created.Id Assert.AreEqualTest2, another.Pattern Assert.TrueReferenceEqualscreated, another   Verify that queries against property changes fail until committed Assert.IsNullterms.FirstOrDefaultterm gt term.Pattern  Test2   Verify that queries against property changes work once committed unitOfWork.SaveChanges Assert.NotNullterms.FirstOrDefaultterm gt term.Pattern  Test2   Verify that deletions are not even reflected locally until committed. terms.Removecreated Assert.AreEqual1, terms.Count   Verify that additions are reflected locally once committed. unitOfWork.SaveChanges Assert.AreEqual0, terms.Count codepre
Negative 292 pRecently for the second time, Ive discovered a webpage that had been displaying properly in Chrome no longer did so, with no changes on my end. I cant even pin down emwhereem Chrome is going wrong. Ill give my examples, and thanks for any suggestions, hints, or solutionsp  pstrongbackgroundimagestrong The website a hrefhttpsaversetter.comsaversetter.coma uses backgroundimages tiled vertically. Chrome no longer shows them. View in Firefox or IE for the gradient background to be visible. Chrome showed this correctly until a few months ago.p  pstrongpositionstrong Scroll to the bottom of a page on a hrefhttpdeadlynightshades.comdeadlynightshades.coma and hover over the zoomers there. Until a few weeks ago Chrome and all browsers showed the title swooping into place centerbottom. Then suddenly, I know now, Chrome emaloneem started mispositioning the titles. I fixed that in Chrome, only to break it in the other browsers which is how it is now. This example currently looks good in Chrome, but shouldnt. View the zoomers in Firefox or IE to see how a misaligned title looks.p  pThese pages worked in Chrome, then suddenly no longer displayed correctly, with no known changes on my end. In its updates, has Chrome been changing, drastically, CSS display for rules involving backgroundimage or absolute position p  pADDENDUM This question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8568673isthereabuginchromescssvisibilityrenderingIs there a bug in Chrome39s CSS visibility renderinga looks relatedto my zoomer problems, sorry I didnt spot it soonerp  pSOLUTION Sorry for asking this, then figuring my own solution. Asking helped me frame the problem, but Ill be more careful with your time in the future The position problem was fixed by specifying a percentage position instead of a pixel position, in the css created by the jquery for animating the title. No general solution to this, or what it was about Chrome that changed. Could not reproduce in a test environment, so it is something about my page in addition to changes in Chrome.p  pConcerning backgroundimage display, Chrome has issues with backgroundsize. p  pcodebackgroundsize 25 autocode is being reduced to codebackgroundsize 25code and the 25 is being reused incorrectly for height as well as width. I changed auto to 100, and Chrome started showing the onepixel tall images. Exactly what auto means in this context is unclear, I dont know why I used it to begin with, but Firefox and IE render it as the size of the image, while Chrome appears to use the other, defined, value for both dimensions.p

Negative 292 pI have an app written in c using nhibernate with an sqlite DB. For unit testing, Im using xunit and an inmemory sqlite db.p  pIm aware that the inmemory DB is destroyed when the session is closed so for testing, I use a single session and keep it open for the duration of the test. In most of my tests this works fine.p  pHowever, in a few cases, I need to test methods that make use of both codeISessioncode and codeIStatelessSessioncode. After a little research, I settled on something similar to the approach described a hrefhttphotgazpacho.org201203testingwithnhibernateinmemory relnofollowherea. So the codeIStatelessSessioncode is created using the codeISessioncodes connection like this p  precodestatelessSession  factory.OpenStatelessSessionexistingSession.Connection codepre  pThe problem is that this seems to cause some sort of conflict as soon as a change is persisted to the DB. If I do a transaction with codesession.SaveOrUpdatenew Entity ...code then thats fine but if I then do a codestatelessSession.GetltEntitygt1code then it will fail with the error message collection is not associated with any session.p  pNormally, this error would indicate that the session is closed, but in this case, both sessions are still open and active.p  pIf I do codesession.GetltEntitygt1code then it returns the entity as expected. Initially, I thought this might be because the session and stateless session were somehow out of sync so I replaced codesession.SaveOrUpdate..code with codestatelessSession.Insertnew Entity ...code and reran the test. Strangely, this made no difference. The regular session still works fine and the statelessSession is still broken.p

Negative 292 pIm working on an AppEngine project and Im using JDO on top of the AppEngine datastore for persistence. I have an entity that uses an encoded string as the key and also uses an application generated keyname also a string. I did this because my app would frequently scoop data potentially scooping the same thing from the wild and attempt to persist them. In an attempt to avoid persisting several entities which essentially contain the same data, I decided to hash some properties about these data so as to get a consistent keyname not manipulating keys directly because of entity relationships. The problem now is that whenever I calculate my hash keyname and attempt to store the entity, if it already exists in the datastore, the datastore or JDO or whoever the culprit is silently overwrites the properties of the entity in the datastore without raising any exception. This has serious effects on the app because it overrides the timeStamps a field of the entities which we use for ordering. How best can I get around thisp

Im using Lucene of version 2.9.4 and I came to a state when I need to optimize an index with 900 segments into much smaller number of segments 110 ideally. Im still calling IndexWriter.optimize thats available in 2.9.4, but setting merge factor fails the same way. p  pSo, what happens is that after an hour of optimizing my logs I have set up all possible logs say that optimization is done and no errors are there in any logs file. Everything looks fine except the fact that the files in index directory are still the same  no number of files reduced or deletes expunged.

Negative 292 pBy design HTML5 Offline support AppCache works if client device is offline or client device is online and server is accessible. After that I cached the application and reopened it in the browser of refresh it when the device has no internet access the browser loads the application from AppCache. In this case the browser strongdoes not trystrong to fetch appcache manifest it understand that were offline.  p  pBut lets consider a case when my device is not offline. It still has internet connection. But my server is down. There could be many different reasons for this hardware failture, AppPool stopped, IIS throttling, DNS error and so on. In this case when I open a cached application in the browser itll try to fetch appcache manifest and gets 404 error not found. And after that the browser clears AppCache for the app So on the next run it wont load it from AppCache and show 404 error page. No more offline work.p  pIt looks strange for me that offline mode functioning depends on a reason the server isnt accessible. Why should I care as a user its no internet connection or server is downp  pSo my question is do anybody know any way to make an application work when a device strongisstrong online but its server isnt reachablebr Ideally I should be able to catch window.applicationCaches emerrorem event and tell it its ok, please continute to use the cache, do not obsolete it.p

Negative 292 pI have three tables Im dealing with for a signup form [months], [members], and [monthsmembers]. That last one is simply a join table. They look something like thisp  precode[months]  [id] INT Primary Key [name] VARCHAR50 [date] DATE  [members]  [id] INT Primary Key [fname] VARCHAR50 [lname] VARCHAR50 [email] VARCHAR300  [monthsmembers]  [id] INT Primary Key [monthid] INT [memberid] INT codepre  pSo, pretty simple, conceptually. Theres a set list of members, and they can sign up for certain months. The form that I have, which allows them to sign up for different months, actually lets administrators enter or change all of the signups all at once. And so I was hoping to use a MERGE statement to get the data into the database with a single query, rather than iterating through multiple queries.p  pSo heres what I started to write even though I know this is not correct syntaxp  precodeMERGE INTO [monthsmembers] mm INNER JOIN [months] mo ON mo.[id]  mm.[monthid]  USING      SELECT 1 AS [monthid], 1 AS [memberid] UNION ALL     SELECT 2 AS [monthid], 3 AS [memberid] UNION ALL     SELECT 4 AS [monthid], 4 AS [memberid]  AS u ON mm.[monthid]  u.[monthid] AND mm.[memberid]  u.[memberid]  WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN      INSERT [monthid], [memberid] VALUES u.[monthid], u.[memberid]  WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE AND DATEPARTYEAR, mo.[start]  2013 THEN      DELETE codepre  pHopefully that illustrates the problem Im running into. I want to insert any new data from the codeUSINGcode subquery into the code[monthsmembers]code table. And I also want to delete anything from the code[monthsmembers]code table that is emnotem present in the codeUSINGcode subquery  but emonly ifem it corresponds to a month in the current year. If there is data not present in the codeUSINGcode subquery that corresponds to a different year, I do emnotem want to delete that. I want to leave that historical data alone. So the codeDATEPARTcode condition is the kicker.p  pSo Im inserting into one table, code[monthsmembers]code, but I also need it to be aware of the code[months]code table. Is there any way to accomplish this Or will I have to concede and iterate through a number of SQL queriesp

Negative 292 pemIm working in AS3 and Adobe AIR for iOS SDK.emp  pThe program has two classes the first one is codeProgram.ascode which is what the FLA file is linked to. In codeProgram.ascode theres a function to start the program and another to restart the program. The second class is my codeMain.ascode class which calls the codefinishNowcode function from codeProgram.ascode to restart the program.p  pIt runs fine on its first runthrough. The problem is that nearly as soon as it restarts, it seems to KEEP restarting itself on its own. It gives quite a few codeArgumentError Error 2025 The supplied DisplayObject must be a child of the caller.code errors too. Ive also noticed that some functions such as TIMERS do not start from 0 again when the program restarts Im really stumped because the logic seems to be okay, but the traces say otherwise.p  pPutting traces inside codeProgram.ascode shows that the codefinishNowcode function is being called repeatedly after the first run. The problem lies with the codeprogramRestartTimercode not resetting on the new instance. By calling the codestopcode function on codeprogramRestartTimercode temporarily fixes this. From the codeError 2025code that keeps showing, I suspect that display Childs which were not removed or similar  such as other Timers also not resetting in the first run are causing this problem. This would suggest that either the program is NOT creating an entirely new instance, or it is not possible with AS3p  pProgram.asp  precodepackage        import flash.display.MovieClip      public class Program extends MovieClip           var runMainMain          public function Program              startNow                   function startNow              runMain  new Mainthis             addChildrunMain                   function finishNow              removeChildrunMain             runMain  new Mainthis             addChildrunMain                codepre  pMain.asp  precodepackage       import flash.display.Sprite      public class Main extends Sprite              public var programProgram         var programRestartTimerTimer  new Timer8  1000          public function MainstageHolderTemp              program  stageHolderTemp             traceprogram              someFunctionsThatDrawGraphics             moreFunctions                   function callFinishFunctionvoid   this is called at the end of the animation             programRestartTimer.start             programRestartTimer.addEventListenerTimerEvent.TIMER, restartProgram                   function restartProgrameTimerEventvoid              programRestartTimer.stop  this line is a temporary fix to stop the program from constantly restarting              it doesnt actually fix the full problem             program.finishNow                 codepre

I should note that this is for homework but I am just asking for help on a small part.p  pHere are simplified and genericized versions of my data classesp  precodeXmlRootElementnameitem XmlTypepropOrdername, value public class Item       private String name     private int value      XmlElementnamename         public String getName          return name           XmlElementnamevalue        public int getValue          return value        codepre  pandp  precodeXmlRootElementnameitemcontainer XmlTypepropOrder name, items public class ItemContainer       private String name     private ArrayListltItemgt items      XmlElementnamename     public String getName          return name           XmlElementnameitems     public ArrayListltItemgt getItem          return item       codepre  pWhat I need to be able to do is convert ItemContainer objects back and forth between JSON to store in a MongoDB database. Has to be MongoDBp  pFrom what I understand ArrayLists cannot be marshalled. p  pWhat I am going to eventually need to do is read from a MongoDB database, unmarshall the JSON into Java objects, perform operations on these objects and then marshall them back into JSON to store in the database.p  pWhat do I need to change or do to allow me to make conversions between JSON and ItemContainerp
Negative 292 pSorry for this dumb question. But I still cant understand this weak stuff and retain cycles. I have a view controller which instantiates another one from storyboard, invokes a method on it and then modally presents. It looks like thisp  precode voidcollectionViewPSTCollectionView collectionView didSelectItemAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      [MBProgressHUD showHUDAddedToself.view animatedYES]      weak ListViewController weakSelf  self     weak UIView weakSelfView  self.view      PhotoViewController controller  [[UIStoryboard storyboardWithNameUI bundlenil] instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierPhotoViewController]     weak PhotoViewController weakController  controller      [controller loadUserDataNSDictionary data          [MBProgressHUD hideHUDForViewweakSelfView animatedYES]          [weakSelf presentViewControllerweakController animatedYES completionnil]     ]  codepre  pIn this chunk of code I have placed weak references for all objects. As I understand weakSelf and weakSelfView are not necessary because they do not retain loadUserData block. weakController retains loadUserData block and so is required.p  pNext piece of code is extracted from controller which is presentedp  precode voidloadUserDatavoid NSDictionary datacomplete      MKNetworkOperation dataLoadOperation  [[MKNetworkOperation alloc] initWithURLStringApiPersonInfoFetchUrl paramsnil httpMethodGET]     weak MKNetworkOperation weakDataLoadOperation  dataLoadOperation      [dataLoadOperation setCompletionBlock         NSDictionary response  [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData[weakDataLoadOperation.responseString dataUsingEncodingNSUTF8StringEncoding] optionsNSJSONReadingMutableContainers errornil]          dispatchasyncdispatchgetmainqueue,              [self updateUIWithDataresponse]              completeresponse              ]      MKNetworkEngine engine  [[MKNetworkEngine alloc] init]     [engine enqueueOperationdataLoadOperation]  codepre  pHere dataLoadOperation retains completion block hence weakDataLoadOperation is presented. Response and self are not retained by dispatchasync block so no weak references are needed.p

Negative 292 pI am reading data from a codeNSFileHandlecode from a codeNSPipecode using a codereadabilityHandlercode blockp  precodefileHandle.readabilityHandler   NSFileHandle handle        [self processData [handle availableData]]  codepre  pThis works fine, I get all the data I expect fed to my codeprocessDatacode method. The problem is that I need to know when the last chunk of data was read. codeavailableDatacode should return an empty codeNSDatacode instance if it reached endoffile, but the problem is that the reachability handler is not called again on EOF.p  pI cant find anything about how to get some kind of notification or callback on EOF. So what am I missing Is Apple really providing an asynchronous reading API without an EOF callbackp  pBy the way, I cannot use the runloop based codereadInBackgroundAndNotifycode method since I dont have a runloop available. If I cannot get this to work with the codeNSFileHandlecode API I probably will directly use a dispatch source to do the IO.p

Negative 292 pIm using this fade in and out JQueryJavascript effect on my site to have each page fade in and out when a link is clicked. Its working great when the link that is clicked leads to a different page, but it is causing problems when the link leads to a different part of the page such as my back to top link, when a mailto link is clicked, and when a link that is suppose to open up in a new page or tab is clicked. When these type of links are clicked they just lead to a blank white page because they dont lead to a new page. Here is the scriptp  precodedocument.readyfunction       Fades body     body.fadeIn1500      Applies to every link     a.clickfunctionevent         event.preventDefault         linkLocation  this.href         body.fadeOut1000, redirectPage                 Redirects page     function redirectPage          window.location  linkLocation       codepre  pBecause of this Im trying to figure out if there is a way where I can exclude this fade inout function from certain links such as the back to top link, but I dont know how to do it. I know that rather than set all the links to fade inout I can set the fade inout effect to a specific class that way it doesnt effect every link. However because the site is rather large, it would be extremely tedious and difficult to add that class to every link. So rather than do that Im wondering if theres a way to define a nofade class that would exclude this fade inout function That way I could apply that class to these few links that are having problems and make those links behave normally.p  pIt seems like a simple thing to do, but because Im still not very fluent in javascriptjquery I dont know how to do it. Any help would be much appreciatedp  pEDIT Here is the solution incase anybody else has a similar issue.

Negative 292 pemstrongEDITemstrong One of the main problems with the code below is due to storing regular expression objects in dictionaries, and how to access them to see if they can match another string.  But I will still leave my previous question because I think theres probably an easy way to do all of this.p  pI would like to find a method in python which knows how to return a boolean of whether or not two strings are referring to the same thing.  I know that this is difficult, if not completely absurd in programming, but I am looking into dealing with this problem using a dictionary of alternative strings that refer to the same thing.p  pHere are some examples, since I know this doesnt make a whole lot of sense without them.p  pIf I give the stringp  pcodebreakingBad.Season01 Episode..02codep  pThen I would like it to match the stringp  pcodeBreaking Bad S01E02codep  pOr codethree.BuCketsof H2Ocode can match code3 buckets of watercodep  pI know this is nearly impossible to do with regard to code3code and codewatercode etc. being synonymous, but I am willing to provide these as dictionaries of relevant regular expression synonyms to the function if need be.p  pI have a feeling that there is a emmuchem simpler way to do this in python, as there always is, but here is what I have so farp  precodeimport re  def checkifmatchgivenstring, stringtomatch, alternativedictionary     print matching , givenstring,   against , stringtomatch      split the string into its parts with pretty much any special character      listofgivenstrings  re.split .,n, givenstring     print List of words retrieved from given string      print listofgivenstrings     check  False     counter  0     for i in rangelenlistofgivenstrings         m  re.searchlistofgivenstrings[i], stringtomatch, re.IGNORECASE         malt  None         try             malt  re.searchalternativedictionary[listofgivenstrings[i]], stringtomatch, re.IGNORECASE         except KeyError             pass         if m or malt             if counter  lenlistofgivenstrings1 check  True             else counter  1             print listofgivenstrings[i],  found to match         else             print listofgivenstrings[i],  did not match             break     return check  string1  breaking Bad.Season01 Episode..02 otherstringtocheck  Breaking.Bad.S01E01  make a dictionary of synonyms   here we should be saying that S01 is equivalent to Season 01 alternativedict  re.compilerS[09],flagsre.IGNORECASEre.compilerSeason [09],flagsre.IGNORECASE,                     re.compilerE[09],flagsre.IGNORECASEre.compilerEpisode [09],flagsre.IGNORECASE print checkifmatchstring1, otherstringtocheck, alternativedict print   another try string2  three.BuCketsof H2O otherstringtocheck2  3 buckets of water alternativedict2  H2Owater, three3 print checkifmatchstring2, otherstringtocheck2, alternativedict2 codepre  pThis returnsp  precodematching  breaking Bad.Season01 Episode..02   against  Breaking.Bad.S01E01 List of words retrieved from given string  [breaking, Bad, Season, 01, Episode, , 02] breaking  found to match Bad  found to match Season  did not match False  matching  three.BuCketsof H2O   against  3 buckets of water List of words retrieved from given string  [three, BuCkets, of, H2O] three  found to match BuCkets  found to match of  found to match H2O  found to match True codepre  pI realize this probably means I am getting something wrong with the dictionary keys and values, but I feel like I am getting further away from a simple pythonic solution that has probably already been created.p  pAnyone have any thoughtsp

Negative 292 pSo I have an H3 that has a grey background rectangle. When you click anywhere in that grey background, a particular div performs a slideToggle. This works fine.p  pNow, Inside that H3 I also have a  link that calls a jquery function that does something. That works fine too. p  pBut my issue is this, since the link is inside the H3, after its functions executes, it also executes the slideToggle because I clicked somewhere inside the H3.p  pSo the question becomes, How do I prevent the slideToggle from happening when I click on the link.

Negative 292 pI have a C program, using mpi, that follows a typical client server model. Each mpi instance of the client connects to a corresponding mpi instance of the server. This has worked relatively well until I have had to do some testing with added latency 1 second of added latency to be precise.p  pProblem Sometimes one of the server processes do not think the client has connected but the client thinks it has connected. i.e. After using gdb, the server is waiting at accept but the client has continued on past connect. Thus, it appears the client thinks it has connected when the server does not think it has connected. p  pMy best guess is that I need to set an sockoption somewhere, however talking to fellow programmers and googling has not yielded any helpful results. p  pEDIT There are two sets of MPI processes so two different calls to mpirun, the accept and connect calls are for the sockets, which are between the two sets of MPI processes.

Negative 292 pI am writing a C application that uses an iostream instance to accumulate and digest large amounts binary data 10M from a web service. The stream is preferred for several reasons, but foremost of these is ease of integration with a thirdparty streambased API without requiring inmemory copies when converting between types.p  pWhen I am done digesting the data, I would like to explicitly free the memory underlying the iostream instance. I am sure that the memory would be freed when the instance goes out of scope, but since Im passing it into an API, Im not sure that it will be handled efficiently. If I were using a stringstream I could call codestdstringstream.clear stdstringstream.strstdstringcode. Is there a similar way to explicitly reset an iostreamp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 292 pIve been working on encrypting a string and displaying it as a QR code after base64 encoding the string. p  pI want to use the ElGamal privatepublic key encryption module in PyCrypto for the encryption, but the problem is that it has no export function to save the key to a text file. Am I missing something And if not, is there a clever way that I can export it, or something else that I should look at instead p  pPS. The reason for using ElGamal and not RSA is that I can make the keys smaller than 1024 bytes, which makes for a smaller, less complicated qr code.p

Negative 292 pIm trying to compile an app on Ubuntu 12.04 x64. It was built on osx with clang 3.2, uses the new c11 standard and has dependencies to boost and GraphicsMagick and running fine.

Unfortunately we have to release the software asap and cant wait for gcc to fix the bugs.p  pAfter some trial and error with clang on linux and reading through some mailing lists I managed according to this post a hrefhttpsplus.google.comu0DeWittClintonpostsVr7y8TPsKgR relnofollowhttpsplus.google.comu0DeWittClintonpostsVr7y8TPsKgRa  to compile it with clang 3.3 and libc and libcabi.

Negative 292 pIm looking for advice on how to set up a build machine for a Linux application that needs to be compiled for both 32 and 64bit architectures.p  pAs far as I know, Ill need a 64 bit OS, which can build both 32 and 64. Adding the m32 flag will produce the right output for 32, no challenge here.p  pThe main issue is with libraries. Im not sure on how to proceed... How can I make sure the linker is using the 32 bit versions of simple libraries, such as ldl, lz, lrt I understand I must install the 32 bit versions of all of them, and then configure the linker path.p  pAnother issue is the version of the compiler, linker, libc and so on. Should I use the oldest versions, in order to ensure all clients will run without issues I mean, if I build the app in the latest Debian, in older Debians it wont work properly, correctp  pThanks for the helpp

Negative 292 pInitially I had Timer0 working fine during the run mode. The only problem is when the device goes to sleep mode, Timer0 stops counting up until awaken. In the datasheet it says to use Timer1 to be able to monitor time during sleep mode.  I modified timer0 existing code to timer1 new configurations, the other code is pretty much the same. However, there is something I might have missed that is different about timer1 than timer0, since the timer1 is not counting up at all.

Negative 292 pIt has recently come to my attention that Java text components use line feed characters LF, codencode, 0x0A to represent and interpret line breaks internally. This came as quite a surprise to me and puts my assumption, that using codeSystem.getPropertyline.separatorcode strongeverywherestrong is a good practice, under a question mark.p  pIt would appear that whenever you are dealing with a text component you should be very careful when using the mentioned property, since if you use codeJTextComponent.setTextStringcode you might end up with a component that contains invisible newlines CRs for example. This might not seem that important, unless the content of the text component can be saved to a file. If you save and open the text to a file using the methods that are provided by all text components, your hidden newlines suddenly materialize in the component upon the file being reopened. The reason for that seems to be that codeJTextComponent.read...code method does the normalization.p  pSo why doesnt codeJTextComponent.setTextStringcode normalize line endings Or any other method that allows text to be modified within a text component for that matter Is using codeSystem.getPropertyline.separatorcode a good practice when dealing with text components Is it a good practice at allp  pSome code to put this question into perspectivep  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeimport java.awt.GridBagConstraints import java.awt.GridBagLayout import java.awt.Insets import java.awt.event.ActionEvent import java.io.File import java.io.FileInputStream import java.io.FileNotFoundException import java.io.FileOutputStream import java.io.IOException import java.io.InputStreamReader import java.io.OutputStreamWriter import java.io.Reader import java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException import java.io.Writer import javax.swing.AbstractAction import javax.swing.JButton import javax.swing.JFrame import javax.swing.JOptionPane import javax.swing.JScrollPane import javax.swing.JTextArea import javax.swing.SwingUtilities  public class TextAreaTest extends JFrame       private JTextArea jtaInput     private JScrollPane jscpInput     private JButton jbSaveAndReopen      public TextAreaTest          super         setDefaultCloseOperationEXITONCLOSE         setTitleText Area Test         GridBagLayout layout  new GridBagLayout         setLayoutlayout                  jtaInput  new JTextArea         jtaInput.setTextSome text followed by a windows newlinern                  and some more text.         jscpInput  new JScrollPanejtaInput         GridBagConstraints constraints  new GridBagConstraints         constraints.gridx  0 constraints.gridy  0         constraints.gridwidth  2         constraints.weightx  1.0 constraints.weighty  1.0         constraints.fill  GridBagConstraints.BOTH         addjscpInput, constraints          jbSaveAndReopen  new JButtonnew SaveAndReopenAction         constraints  new GridBagConstraints         constraints.gridx  1 constraints.gridy  1         constraints.anchor  GridBagConstraints.EAST         constraints.insets  new Insets5, 0, 2, 2         addjbSaveAndReopen, constraints          pack           public static void mainString[] args          SwingUtilities.invokeLaternew Runnable               public void run                  TextAreaTest tat  new TextAreaTest                 tat.setVisibletrue                                 private class SaveAndReopenAction extends AbstractAction           private File file  new Filetextareatest.txt          public SaveAndReopenAction              superSave and Reopen                   private void saveToFile                  throws UnsupportedEncodingException, FileNotFoundException,                 IOException               Writer writer  null             try                  writer  new OutputStreamWriter                         new FileOutputStreamfile, UTF8                 TextAreaTest.this.jtaInput.writewriter              finally                  if writer  null                      try                          writer.close                      catch IOException ex                                                                       private void openFile                  throws UnsupportedEncodingException, IOException              Reader reader  null             try                  reader  new InputStreamReader                         new FileInputStreamfile, UTF8                 TextAreaTest.this.jtaInput.readreader, file              finally                  if reader  null                      try                          reader.close                      catch IOException ex                                                                       public void actionPerformedActionEvent e              Throwable exc  null             try                  saveToFile                 openFile              catch UnsupportedEncodingException ex                  exc  ex              catch FileNotFoundException ex                  exc  ex              catch IOException ex                  exc  ex                          if exc  null                  JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog                         TextAreaTest.this, exc.getMessage, An error occured,                         JOptionPane.DEFAULTOPTION, JOptionPane.ERRORMESSAGE                                     codepre  pAn example of what this program saves on my windows machine after adding a new line of text why the single CR oOp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAiwme.png altenter image description herep  pstrongEdit01strongp  pI randebugged this from within Netbeans IDE, which uses JDK1.7u15 64bit CProgram FilesJavajdk1.7.015 on Windows 7.p

I need to change the default setting for the Debugging Working Directory option so users who check out this project dont have to continually change it before they can launch the debugger.p  pI had thought that moving that generated setting entry from the Project User Options File to the Project File would be sufficient. It does work  as in the default working directory changes  BUT then I can no longer debug the project from inside VS. When trying to run the debugger, all I get is a dialog box saying that VS is unable to start the debugger. Looking at the debugging settings they seem fine and unchanged.p  pSo what is the correct way to set a default debugging working directory for a VS projectp  pNOTE The dialog box only appears if you MOVE the setting entry from the User Options File to the Project File. If you just copy the entry  so that it is in both files  there is no problems running the debugger. Unfortunately this means, again, the user still has to add the setting manually.p
Negative 292 pIm new to multiprocessing in Python and trying to figure out if I should use Pool or Process for calling two functions async. The two functions I have make curl calls and parse the information into a 2 separate lists. Depending on the internet connection, each function could take about 4 seconds each. I realize that the bottleneck is in the ISP connection and multiprocessing wont speed it up much, but it would be nice to have them both kick off async. Plus, this is a great learning experience for me to get into pythons multiprocessing because I will be using it more later. p  pI have read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8533318pythonmultiprocessingpoolwhentouseapplyapplyasyncormapPython multiprocessing.Pool when to use apply, applyasync or mapa and it was useful, but still had my own questions. p  pSo one way I could do it isp  precodedef foo     pass  def bar     pass  p1  Processtargetfoo, args p2  Processtargetbar, args  p1.start p2.start p1.join p2.join codepre  pQuestions I have for this implementation is 1 Since join blocks until calling process is completed...does this mean p1 process has to finish before p2 process is kicked off I always understood the .join be the same as pool.apply and pool.applysync.get where the parent process can not launch another processtask until the current one running is completed.p  pThe other alternative would be something likep  precodedef foo     pass  def bar     pass pool  Poolprocesses2              p1  pool.applyasyncfoo p1  pool.applyasyncbar codepre  pQuestions I have for this implementation would be 1 Do I need a pool.close, pool.join  2 Would pool.map make them all complete before I could get results And if so, are they still ran asynch  3 How would pool.applyasync differ from doing each process with pool.apply 4 How would this differ from the previous implementation with Processp

Negative 292 pI have code for quicksort and mergesort, and Ive placed a global counter variable that gets incremented for every iterationcomparison that is made.  I would assume this would correspond to my rough asymptotic analysis.  For merge sort it does, but for quicksort it doesnt.  I dont understand why.  Im choosing the last element of the input array is the pivot in every iteration.  I know that this is nonoptimal, but that doesnt matter for the sake of this discussion.  Since Im choosing the last element, I would expect that both ascending and descending order arrays would result in On2 comparisons.  To be more specific, I would expect that the number of comparisons would be n choose 2, because you are adding n  n1  n2  n3  ....  1 in the worst case.  But this does not seem to be happening.  p  pOn an input size of 100,000, with the input sorted in descending order I get 705,082,704 iterations counted.  I get the same number for an input array sorted in ascending order. But 100,000 choose 2 is around 5 billion.  Why the discrepancy p  pFor merge sort, with an input of 100,000, I get approx 1.6 million iterations, which is seemingly correct.  p  pThe following is the code which includes my implementation of quicksort as well as my counting technique, both of which may be off and thus causing this discrepancy.  Otherwise it must be that my logic is wrong about how many iterations this should takep  pAlso, as an aside, its curious to me that although the number of comparisons are the same in both the ascending and descending input arrays, the ascending version is 23 times as fast.  What could account for that.

Negative 292 pI am having a serious bestpractice issue porting my iOS app to the Mac.p  pId like to display a searchable list whose entries are either other lists or single entries, for which the user can then show a detail view. Under iOS, this is simply implemented by using a stack of codeUITableViewControllercodes for the lists, with another different codeUITableViewControllercode for displaying an entrys details.p  pHowever, under OS X, we dont have codeUINavigationControllercode. It might be possible to implement such a structure via an codeNSOutlineViewcode or codeNSBrowsercode which are used to display hierarchical data, but I fear that the detail view which could be implemented as a view on the bottommost level in the outline view or as the preview controller for the browser will look outofplace then. In addition, Id like to display the list in an codeNSPopovercode as I do on iOS, and placing an codeNSOutlineViewcode or a codeNSBrowsercode inside a codeNSPopovercode might look less than elegant.p  pAny moreorless simple solutionsp

Negative 292 pWithin a knockout VM I am trying to inject a date time into a property. The function generates the correct date but when it is rendered out in the UI I get a 12311969 7pm date.  This items is not being serialized and is being generated on the fly. Can someone help me understand why this is being generated and how to correct it. I have seen a number of articles on where this appears in php code but nothing specific to knockout. There was one article on SO that references the dateTimePicker but I did not immediately see a similarity between the OPs issue or mine.p  pWithin my js file p  precodefunction returnDateFormat       var d  new Date      date  d.getDate     date  date lt 10  0  date  date      mon  d.getMonth  1     mon  mon lt 10  0  mon  mon      year  d.getFullYear      hours  d.getHours      min  d.getMinutes      sec  d.getSeconds      return mon    date    year     hours    min    sec  codepre  pWhere the function is referenced in my ajax call on success.

It parses and formats the Json string. I didnt realize this at the time as I had not written this portion of the mapping. p  pThe reason it was breaking was I passing in a formatted date time and not a Json serialized string which the function expected. To correct this I plan to generate client side a date time and then serialize it, pass it to the function and this should correct the issue.  I will post a working solution soon.  I would welcome other suggestions. cheersp

Negative 292 pIm developing an app and I have to cater for pretty much majority of android devices between 4 inches and 10 inches and was wondering if theres a way to create a universal screen layout that would scale based on the device.p  pThis would be a better way as opposed to my current logic of developing different layouts and respective activities for each screen category i.e. 4 inches, 5 inches etc.p  pAs indicated below, I utilise the DisplayMetrics Fields and pythagoras theorem to determine the screen size i.e. for example to find the height of the device I undertake the following calculationp  precodedouble yDeviceScreenSize  Math.powDeviceScreenSize.heightPixelsDeviceScreenSize.ydpi,2 codepre  pThe above line of code is essentially the absolute height of the display in pixels divided by the exact physical pixels per inch of the screen in the Y dimension, followed by squaring the value.p  pIn similar fashion I obtain the width figure the same way. This is indicated belowp  precodedouble xDeviceScreenSize  Math.powDeviceScreenSize.widthPixelsDeviceScreenSize.xdpi,2 codepre  pThe above calculations are followed by obtaining the square root value

Is there anything like this in pandasp  pI read the doc and there seems to be quite comprehensive examples for timestamp on a daily resolution, which is good for fund managers, I guess. Is there a millisecond resolution time structp
Negative 292 pFor example, I have a standalone block calledp  precode.maincompanylogo    background url..imageslogocompany.png   width 88px   display block   textindent 9999999px   height 60px     codepre  pThis block happens to reside in the header but can be anywhere also. Now, if its in the header it needs to be floated to the left and also have a border. If so, is this a correct way of doing itp  precode.headermain  [properties]    .headermain .maincompanylogo      float left     border 1px solid FFF    codepre  pOr as per BEMp  precode.maincompanylogo  [properties]    .maincompanylogomainheader      float left     border 1px solid FFF    codepre  pWhich of the two is betterp

Negative 292 pIve been roaming around the internet for an answer to my question but have yet to find one.p  pHeres the scenario  I have a WCF library service that works against a database containing a few configuration of mine. These configurations are made up of a few custom classes  p  precode[DataContract] public class Config  Object      [DataMember]     public int AppId  get set       [DataMember]     public int VersionId  get set       [DataMember]     public string Name  get set       [DataMember]     public DateTime DateCreated  get set       [DataMember]     private ListltParameterRowgt ParameterRows  null   [DataContract] public class ParameterRow  Object      [DataMember]     public string Name  get set       [DataMember]     public int Id  get set       [DataMember]     private ListltParameterItemgt parameterItems  null   [DataContract] public class ParameterItem  Object      [DataMember]     public string Name  get set       [DataMember]     public string Value  get set       [DataMember]     public string DataType  get set   codepre  pThere you can see how its all related. I also included a methodhead just to show you an example of the simple functions.  I have my current code working fine with the current functions including the DB. I also have a WCF library service that retrieves configurations from the database and gives out to the client when they call the service. Below is the functionhead the clients call to the service.p  precodepublic Config GetConfigint id codepre  pHowever, I cannot figure out how to get a whole configuration to the client in one call and still be able to use the methods of the Configclass.  I know how to use datamembers and get properties to the client, but not collections nor methods to use. I have access to the configclass on both sides, Ive just run out of ideas at the moment. p  pSuggestionstips anyone Greatly appreciatedp  pEDIT  This is the GetConfigmethod in the servicep  precodepublic Config GetConfigint id              dbHandler  new DatabaseHandlernew StoredProceduresFake         resultConfig  dbHandler.GetLatestConfigurationid         return resultConfig      codepre  pAnd here is the clients side of the callI just created a consoleapp to test the service p  precoderesultConfig  client.GetConfig1 codepre  pBut in the clientfunction I now get errors on all the configproperties.  In the client VStudio want me to write Config.Name  NamekBackingField Whereas the service only need to write ConfigName.  And I cant access the list of parameterrows, thus rendering the whole config useless to me. My guess is that the rest of the data is in the Config.ExtensionData, but I dont know how to access that.p  pFINAL EDIT This has been resolved. As mentioned below only properties were sent over the network from the WCFservice. To solve this I created another class which extracted data from the class Config received from the service, stored it as wanted and also gave me the possibility to get my own methods. It was a simple solution of parsing the data. In a way heh. Thanks for all the help, greatly appreciatedp

Negative 292 pI have a service that Im using to monitor the connectivity of an attached USB accessory. The service has no problem picking up intents with codeACTIONUSBACCESSORYDETACHEDcode, but does not pick up intents with codeACTIONUSBACCESSORYATTACHEDcode.p  pThe same is true for an activity, i.e., the activity never actually seems to get the intent with action codeACTIONUSBACCESSORYATTACHEDcode, but instead gets a codeMAINcode intent action which calls the activitys codeonResumecode method. While not ideal, this behaviour does allow a work around in an activity by coding up the codeonResumecode method appropriately, see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19770788intentfilternotcallingonreceiveforusbaccessoryattachedIntent Filter not calling onReceive for USBACCESSORYATTACHEDa p  pUnfortunately, I do not have an codeonResumecode method in a service, and so can not use the work around that can be used in activities. However, the system must be broadcasting something when a USB accessory is attached what is this intent, and is there anyway a service can receive this intentp  pIt appears that Android is implementing a strange methodology for broadcasting USB attachdetach intents. It just doesnt make sense why I should be able to pick up detached events so easily and not attached events. Could this be a bug, or poor implementation.p

Negative 292 pAfter reading the documentation, testing and reading a lot of other questions here on stackoverflowp  pWe have documents that have titles and description in multiple languages. There are also tags that are translated to the same languages. There might be up to 3040 different languages in the system, but probably only 3 or 4 translations for a single document.p  pThis is the planned document structure p  precode  luck      id 10018,     pub 0,     pr 100002,     loc        lat 42.7,       lon 84.2     ,     t [            lang enanalyzer,     title Forest,     desc A lot of trees.,     tags [       Wood,       Nature,       Green Mouvement     ]       ,            lang franalyzer,     title Fort,     desc A grand nombre darbre.,     tags [       Bois,       Nature,       Mouvement Vert     ]            ],     dates [       20140101T2000,       20140606T2000,       20140808T2000     ]     codepre  pPossible queries are arbre or wood or forest or nature combined with a date and a geodistance filter, furthermore there will be some facets over the tags array that obviously include counting.p  pWe can produce any document structure that fits best for elasticsearch or for lucene. Its crucial that each language is analyzed specifically, so we use analyzer in order to distinguish the languages. p  precode   luck      properties        id      type long       ,       pub      type long       ,       pr      type long       ,       loc      type geopoint       ,       t      analyzer        path t.lang     ,     properties        lang          type string       ,     properties        title          type string       ,       desc          type string       ,       tags          type string                             codepre  pA Apparently, this idea does not work after PUTting the mapping, we retrieve the same mapping GET and it seems to ignore the specific analyzers A test with a toplevel analyzer worked fine. Does analyzer work for subdocuments and if yes how to should we refer to it We also tested declaring the subdocument as object or nested. How is multilanguage document indexing supposed to work.p  pB One possibility would be to put each language in its own document In that case how do we manage the id Finally both documents should refer to the same id. For example if the user searches for nature and we dont know if the user intends to find nature in English or French, this document would appear twice in the result set, and the counting and paging would be very wrong also facet counting.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 292 pIm working in Silverlight, but potentially a WPF solution would work as well.p  pMy problem is very simple. I have lots of modal Child Windows that can be open, and in their generic menu is a home button. This button is supposed to close all of the child windows and return to the base screen. I have a few different types of generic child windows that host lots of different UserControls, so by far the easiest way to implement this is to, when the window comes into focus, check if the global codeReturnToHomecode bool is true, and if it is, just close it.p  pIve tried all of thesep  precode    private void ChildWindowGotFocusobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e              if CommonResources.ReturnToHome DialogResult  false           private void ChildWindowMouseEnterobject sender, MouseEventArgs e              if CommonResources.ReturnToHome DialogResult  false           private void ChildWindowIsEnabledChangedobject sender, DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs e              if CommonResources.ReturnToHome DialogResult  false      codepre  pThe issue is, codeGotFocuscode doesnt fire until I actually click on the window. codeMouseEntercode is a little better, but doesnt fire until I move the mouse. codeIsEnabledChangedcode never fires because the Child Window doesnt disable anything. Checking every child window when it closes to see if Home has been clicked isnt easy because of the sheer number of places where you can open child windows, and several of them are nested within User Controls where I couldnt even easily access codeDialogResultcode. Any idea how I could do thisp  pAlso I should note that I want each of the windows to close one by one, from top down, because each window that closes does its own verification to see if it should warn the user before closing giving the user the option to cancel closingp

Negative 292 pHow to use exactly 8 threads for the expensive parts all the timep  pI have a number crunching problem for which I created a simple framework. My problem is to find an elegant and simple way to use all CPU cores optimally.p  pTo get good performance I use a thread pool with fixed size of 8. The idea is to use as many threads as there are hardware threads for optimal performance. p  pSimplified pseudo code usage of the framework is as followsp  precodeinterface Task    data[] computedata[]   Task task  new Loopnew Chainnew DoX, new DoY, new Split2, new DoZ result  task.computedata codepre  ul liLoop Task would loop until some termination criteria is metli liChain Task would chain tasks e.g. in the above r  t1.computer r  t2.computer r  t3.computer return rli liSplit Task would split the data and execute a task on the parts e.g. create 2 parts and return new data[] t1.computepart1, t1.computepart2li ul  pThe threading is implemented in the Split Task at the moment. So the Split Task would hand the computation of t1.computepart1 and t1.computepart2 to the thread pool.p  h2Approach 1, probably complete deadlockh2  pMy first approach was that the Split Task has an array of futures and calls get on one after another. But that means if the Split Task is inside another Split Task, that the blocking wait in future.get will block the thread that the outer Split Task took from the thread pool. So I have less than 8 threads really working. If this hierarchy is deep, I maybe have nobody working and wait forever.p  pstrong1strong I assume future.get will not return the thread to the thread pool, right So if done like that I will wait in future.get but no more threads to ever start the work [I cannot easy test that because I already changed the approach]p  h2Approach 2, the current one, at least somebody workingh2  pMy current approach not much better is to do the final part partN of a split with the current thread. If finished I check if partN1 was already started, if yes I wait for all tasks in future.get otherwise current thread does partN1 too, and if needed partN2... So now I should always have at least one thread of the pool working.p  pBut since the answer to question 1 probably is that future.get will block my threads, with this approach I will have only few working threads on deep hierarchies.p  h2Approach 3, the only solution I seeh2  pI assume I must use 2 thread pools, one for the hard work and one for all the waiting. So I would have a fixed size thread pool for the hard work and a dynamic one for the waiting.p  p3.a. But that means that the Split Task must only spawn threads from the waiting pool and the Task doing real work will spawn a new thread from the work pool and wait for it to complete. Ugly, but should work. Ugly because at the moment the whole threading support is all in the Split Task, but with this solution other Tasks doing the hard work must know about threading.p  p3.b. Another approach would be that Split spawns worker threads, but inside split each waiting must be done by a waiting thread while the current thread also does worker thread tasks in the meantime. With this, all threading support is in Split Task class, but Im not sure how to implement that.p  pstrong2astrong How can I wait for the tasks without blocking the current threadp  pstrong2bstrong Can I return the current thread to the worker thread pool, let a waiter thread wait and then after waiting continue with the previous current thread or a thread from the worker pool Howp  h2Other solutionsh2  pDont use a fixed sized thread pool.p  pstrong3strong Is my idea to have 8 threads wrong But how many then if the hierarchies can be deep And isnt there the risk that the JVM starts many tasks in parallel and switches a lot between themp  pstrong4strong What do I miss or what would you do to solve that problemp  pThanks a lot and regardsp  hr  h2[EDIT]h2  h2Accepted Solution and why I try something different based on approach 2h2  pI accepted the ForkJoinPool as the correct solution.p  pHowever, some of the details and possible overhead and loss of control make me want to try another approach. But the more I think about it, the more I come back to using ForkJoinPool see Note at the end for the reason. Sorry for the amount of text.p  pa hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavautilconcurrentForkJoinPool.html relnofollowhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavautilconcurrentForkJoinPool.htmlap  pHowever, no such adjustments are guaranteed in the face of blocked IO or other unmanaged synchronization.p  pmaximum number of running threads to 32767p  pa hrefhttphomes.cs.washington.edudjgteachingMaterialsgrossmanSPACforkJoinFramework.html relnofollowhttphomes.cs.washington.edudjgteachingMaterialsgrossmanSPACforkJoinFramework.htmlap  pThe documentation for the ForkJoin framework suggests creating parallel subtasks until the number of basic computation steps is somewhere over 100 and less than 10,000.p  pThe hard work Tasks read a lot of data from disk and it is very far from 10,000 basic computations. Actually I could forkjoin it down to maybe acceptable levels, but this is too much work now because that part of the code is rather complex.p  pI think approach 3a is basically an implementation of ForkJoin, except that I would have more control and probably less overhead and the problems just mentioned above should not exist but no automatic adaption to CPU resources provided by OS, but I will force the OS to give me what I want if I have to.p  pI maybe try to use approach 2 with some changes that way I can work with an exact thread number and I dont have any waiting threads, ForkJoinPool seems to work with waiting threads if I understand it correctly.p  pCurrent thread does jobs until all jobs in this Split instance are being run by a worker thread so work stealing in Split node like previously, but then it will not call future.get, but just check if all futures are ready with future.isDone. If not all are done, it will steal a job from the thread pool and execute it, then it checks the futures again. That way I will never wait as long as there is a single job that is not running.p  pThe Ugly if there is no job to steal I would have to sleep for a short time and then check the futures again or steal a new job from the pool is there a way to wait for multiple Futures to all be complete with a timeout that will not cancel the computations if it triggersp  pSo I think I have to use a Completion Service for the ThreadPool in each Split Task, then I can poll using a timeout and do not need to sleep.p  pAssumption the ThreadPool in the Completion Service can still be used like a normal ThreadPool e.g. Job stealing. One ThreadPool can be in many Completion Services.p  pI think this is the optimal solution for the problem detailed in the question. However, there is a small problem with that, see the following.p  h2Noteh2  pAfter looking at the hard tasks again, I see that they can be parallelized for many of their instantiations. So adding threading there too is the next logical step. These are always leaf nodes and the work they do is optimally done with a completion service in some cases subjobs can have different runtimes but any 2 results can build a new job. To do them with the ForkJoinPool I would have to use managedBlock and implement ForkJoinPool.ManagedBlocker, which make the code more complex. However, at the same time the usage of CompletionService in these leave nodes means my approach 2 based solution will probably need waiting threads too, so I maybe better go with ForkJoinPool.p

Its very thin and as expected round the entire NSTableView and not just the bit below the table header as Id like.p  pSo my question is what is the right thing to sublclass and what methods do I need so that when I peform a drag and drop from the Finder, the ClipView highlights properly and codeprepareForDragOperationcode and codeperformDragOperationcode get called. p  pAnd also when codeperformDragOperationcode is successful how can this method call a method within my FileListController telling it to create a new codeFilecode object and adding it to the NSMutableArrayp

Negative 292 pImage my server provides an email service that I am using memcache for. When a sender sends a new email to user X, the key for X is removed from the cache. When user X makes a call to codegetInboxcode the response is added to the cache under the key for X so that the same response is returned for subsequent calls to getInbox until a sender removes the key and the process continues. So a very simple design. But what happens when X is reading at the same time that some sender is sending X an email Per my understanding putIfUntouched and getIdentifiable do not help here. As they seem to only work if I am using in putIfUntouched the exact same instancevalue returned by getIdentifiable, which is not possible in my case since I am talking about two different service calls. So does anyone know how I might avoid race conditions in my simple modelp  pstrongupdatestrongp  pIn light of AndreiVolgins response, let me add details to what I perceive to be the race conditionp  pSenders job is to remove the key recipients job is to 1 read the value with codesyncCache.getkeycode, 2 if the value is null then set the key to a real value with codesyncCache.putkey, valuecode. The problem is in the case where send is trying to set the value to null while at the same time recipient is calling codesyncCache.putkey, valuecode. If recipient wins in setting to codevaluecode then recipient may never get to see the change made by sender.p

Negative 292 pI start reading about jee 7 and one thing i read isp  pServlet technology has allowed only traditional blocking inputoutput during request processing since its inception. In the Servlet 3.1 release, the new NonBlocking IO API makes it possible for servlets to read or write without any blockingp  pHow true is this statement since Servlet 3.0 introduced the AsyncContext and the asynch servletp  pThis means that other tasks can be performed at the same time as a read or write is occurring, without any wait. This in turn means that now you can more easily accomplish Ajax and partialpage refreshes without making separate calls to the servlet for each updatep  pSo what is the new feature introduced in servlet 3.1 compared to 3.0 specs for asynch servlets p  pThanksp
Negative 292 pI am seeing an odd problem when using an embedded Scala interpreter. It manifests itself as a corruption  of the hosting noninterpreter class loader. It roughly goes like thisp  ul liI have a class codeFoocode in the hosting environmentli liI am matching against codeFoocode in some place codecase f Foo gt ...codeli liI am running the interpreter at some point codeIMain gt interpretcodeli liAfter that the pattern match for codeFoocode fails if I check the class it is codeFoocode but it does not match with codeFoocodeli ul  pSo I except that there are now two competing class loaders which produce two nonidentical instances of codeclass Foocode. There is emonly oneem codeFoocode in my entire class path, so there is no way that it could be shadowed. Also, it is sufficient to run something like code1  1code in the interpreter, so there is absolutely no way that the codeIMaincode itself tried to load class codeFoocode.p  pI know this is very vague, but I am hoping for hints as to trace the bug.p  hr  pstrongEditstrong After further investigation, this problem occurs only when building against Scala 2.11.0, but disappears when building against 2.10.4 I ensured that the builds were made from cleanstate. This worries me, because it could indicate a new problem with the 2.11 interpreterp  pThe class involved codeFoocode in the example is a Java class, so there is also no reason to believe it was compiled against the wrong Scala version.p  hr  pstrongEditstrong After further investigation, this problem might relate to Java Swing rather than the Scala interpreter. codeFoocode is actually a codejavax.swing.text.Documentcode subclass, and I can see some problems with codeJEditorPanecode a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1855808howcanisafelysolvethisjavacontextclassloaderproblemHow can I safely solve this Java context classloader problema and Swing threading a hrefhttpbugs.java.comviewbug.dobugid8017776 relnofollowhttpbugs.java.comviewbug.dobugid8017776a.

Once it reaches above 6 to 6.5 GB and system memory reaches 7 GB, the JVM stops responding. due to shortage of memory and heavy paging activity. The heap and permgen however collectively remain at or below 3.8 3.50.3 GB.  This means that non heap memory native memory  thread stack space keeps growing from a few 100 MBs after CQ5 server restart to more than 23 GBs after long runs 45 hrs with heavy loads. So our goal is basically to find out the memory leaks in nonheap memory which could be introduced due to 3rd party libraries, indirect references of Java code etc. strongWe are not receiving any out of memory errors.strongp  pstrongHelp neededstrongp  ul liNow most of the tools we used are giving us good information and details about heap memory.

Negative 292 pIm trying to learn web development, and I bet that this is a simple problem and that Im overlooking something obvious.p  pIn my default crud edit controller generated using the MVC framework I retrieve my model from a localDB instance using my EntityFrameworks dbContext. That is sent to the View. In the debugger just before the controller call to codereturn Viewmodelcode I can see that the Id is set to 2.p  pWhen the [post] edit controller is fired I see that the identity property is 3. I wanted to figure out why so I changed the View to display my Id property and I see that it is 3 as soon as I render the page. Last time I saw it the property was 2, now it is 3.p  pI dont know how to hook into any logic that would happen between the time I send off my model and when when the view is rendered.p  pCan anyone help me learn how to debug this so that I can figure out why my Id property is incremented when I pass the model into the viewp

Negative 292 pFor a new project I am comparing ElasticSearch and the GAE Search API. What I need is a custom scoring functionality that is able to handle some custom scoring functions, likep  ul lilowering the documents score on distance from a specific geopoint the further away, the lower te scoreli libasing the score on term frequency for fulltext searchesli liusing soft filterqueries if a filterquery does not match, it does not exclude the document, but just lowers its scoreli ul  pAll of this is possible with ElasticSearch, but I cant find a way to implement the third point in GAE Search API. I also cant figure out if the first option just works as a filter in GAE Search API or that it also changes the score of the document. Does anybody know if this is possiblep

Negative 292 pI need a screen where Ill guide the users what to do and they should follow my instructions. This screen only appears as firttimeuse screen and never appears again. I found an app named Cover Lockscreen. Its tuorial screen is just the right thing I need.p  pPlease take a look at a hrefhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0B3QH139mjilNjF0cDBKdlp5TGcedituspsharing relnofollowhereap  pI have tried using framelayout set its background with an image and putting some interactive things so users can play with. But the problem is that the screen resolution will change with different devices and firstly this makes my background change, sometimes distorted. Secondly as the background changes, the interactive area changes too and I cant control whether the area is still in the right place with the background anymore. p  pI have also tried Showcase library and its not enough. There must be some ways to do this I believe.p  pstrongEDIT strong Ok sorry I wasnt clear enough. Let me say this againp  pI got a nice picture, its resolution is 1080x1920. Ill use it as the background of the acitivity. The picture content is something like the one I posted below. As you can see, theres a hand holding the phone in the picture. I want to ask users to draw an S on the screen of that phone.p  pTo do that, I create a new activity. The main layout will be framelayout. I set the background of framelayout with the picture 1080x1920 resolution. Ill set the theme of this activity to noTitleBar and Fullscreen so the picture will not be distorted. Then I put GestureOverlayView because we can draw and recoginze gesture on it on the framelayout. I set the margin left and top, width and height with some strongfixed valuesstrong in dp so that it is on the phone of the background. If everything works as its planned then the result is that GestureOverlayView will lay on the screen of the phone I use red color to indicate the area of GestureOverlayViewp  pstrongPROBLEMstrongp  pI cant handle picture distortion. As my origin picture is 1080x1920 so other screen resolutions like 480x800 Nexus S 800x1280 Nexus 7 will cause distortion,... and of course with tablet, its even worse my current solution to tablets is...forcing the screenOrientation to be portrait. If the background gets distorted then the area of the phone will strongchangestrong. So the marginleft, margintop, width, height of GestureOverlayView will not be correct anymore. I cant use 9patch cuz my picture is pretty complicated.p  pstrongResultstrongp  pDevices with 10801920 and 7201280 will have a nice background with the correct interactive area. Meanwhile, devices with other resolutions will have a distorted background and the interactive area maybe somewhere but not on the phone of the picture I set as the background. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlwfCf.png altenter image description herep

Negative 292 pIn IOS, is there a way to instruct the GPU not to resolve drawing conflicts that result from overlap from drawing a large number of line segments that often cross each other maybe something in Open GL  The line segments are all the same color and the alpha is 1.0 so there is no need for the GPU to worry about what might appear on top when overlapped pixels exist.   I suspect that if I can get the GPU to not waste effort in resolving the overlapping drawing conflicts that my algorithm will be able to operate at full speed at all times since I always draw the same number of lines.  p  pI ask because I have developed a smooth curve morphing algorithm that uses a library of complex but artful geometric shapes.  The algorithm continuously morphs to some next shape from the library.  I run this on an iPad, and with the high resolution screen, its a very unique and artistic effect.   I notice that the drawing of the morphing curve slows down when there are many crossing lines in the drawing.  This will occur at 2 times.  If 1 of the shapes has a lot of twists and turns and as a result a lot of crossing lines, then the drawing process noticeably becomes chunky and slower than normal.  The other occurrence is if 1 of the shapes being morphed to is a single point.  In that instance, even simpler shapes without a lot of twists and turns has the appearance of shrinking its scale down towards the single point.  As it gets close to the singularity, the shape is so small that the line width and scale now cause a lot of overlapping of the drawn lines, and slowed drawing occurs.  p  pI have included a code snippet below, that shows the drawing calls that I am making, but I blanked out things that are proprietary to my algorithm with the word PROPRIETARY. Please note that I draw well over 1000 lines per frame, so there is quite a bit of detail that can be shown.  In general, the more detail shown, the more artistic and aesthetic the drawing.  My base equations have 100 quintillion possible combinations, thats one and 20 zeros 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 so as you can imagine, the resulting smooth curves have many interesting shapes and loops possible with some being symmetric and some being asymmetric and yet having artistic merit.  Indeed, one of the curves I have found looks much like a wolves face outline, with ears chin, cheeks, etc.p  pThe smooth curve morphing base code was approved by Apple yesterday in the iCanMorph app as one of 65 artful drawing modes.  This effect is only currently included in the iPad version.  If you decide to examine the slowed drawing effect that I am experiencing the app is free, it best to use a newer iPad with a faster processor.  On an iPad Air, the algorithm keeps up very nicely, except once in a while under the conditions described above.

I expect the app to quickly have several thousand shapes in its database.

Negative 292 pI have a table meant for assignments. These assignments have multiple requirements things users need to have in order to be allowed to take the assignment. I have these requirements as ids from a requirements table.p  pI want users to get the assignments they meet the requirements for. So I have a set of ids that a user has in php, and I need to query the assignments who only ask for the ids that that user has, or less.p  pI thought to create a json array with all the requirements and put it in a column in the assignments table. Then also create a json array with the requirements the user has, and then use it in a LIKE query.p  pBut I found out that wouldnt work.p  pFor example, I have [6,9,11] as requirements and 6 7 9 11 12 what the user has.p  pThe requirements themself would fit into the ones that the user has using 6 etc, not the other way around.p  pSo my question is, how can I search in my assignments table, somehow supplying the ids that the user has, and only get the rows that meet the ids that the user has, or less.p  pI could also make a table for the requirements, instead of a column, with for each requirement a row, but then I dont know how to search that in one query as well.p

Negative 292 pI have a emveryem frustrating problem with a clients network environment, and Im hoping someone can lend a hand in helping me figure this out...p  pThey have an app that for now is written entirely inside of VBA for Excel. No laughing.p  pPart of my helping them improve their product and user experience involved converting their UI from VBA form elements to a single WebBrowser element that houses a rich web app which communicates between Excel and their servers. It does this primarily via a socket.io serverconnection.p  pWhen the user logs in, a connection is made to a room on the socket server.p  pstrongInitial owner calledstrongp  precodesocket.oncreate, function roomName, userName      socket.username  userName     socket.joinroomName  codepre  pstrongFollowup participant calledstrongp  precodesocket.onadduser, function userName, roomName      socket.username  userName     socket.joinroomName     servletparam  roomName     var request  requirerequest      requestbserURL  servletparam, function error, response, body          io.sockets.toroomName.emitmessages, body           servletparam  roomName     userName     request baseURL  servletparam, function error, response, body          io.sockets.toroomName.emitparticipantList, body       codepre  pThis all worked beautifully well until we got to the point where their VBA code would lock everything up causing the socket connection to get lost. When the client surfaces form its forced VBA induced pause that lasts anywhere from 20 seconds to 3 minutes, I try to join the room again by passing an onclick to an HTML element that triggers a script to rejoin. Oddly, that doesnt work. However if I wait a few seconds and click the object by hand, it does rejoin the room. Yes, the click is getting received from the Excel file... we see the message to the socket server, but it doesnt allow that call to rejoin the room.p  pHeres what makes this really hard to debug. Theres no ability to see a console in VBAs WebBrowser object, so I use weinre as a remote debugger, but a it seems to not output logs and errors to the console unless Im triggering them to happen in the console, and b it loses its connection when socket.io does, and Im dead in the water.p  pNow, for completeness, if I remove the .join calls and the .to calls, it all works like wed expect it to minus all messages being written into a big nonprivate room. So its an issue with rejoining rooms.p  pAs a longtime user of StackOverflow, I know that a long question with very little code is frowned upon, but there is absolutely nothing special about this setup which is likely part of the problem. Its just simple emits and broadcasts from the client. Im happy to fill anything in based on followup questions.p
Negative 292 pI have a pretty weird thing I need to do  Access some secure instructions for things that dont really need to be done in a secure context.  In short I need to get in to Secure Mode, but not because I want Hardware TPMish functionality or anything.  I just need access to certain instructions that I wouldnt otherwise have.p  pWere doing this on Gumstix Overo FireSTORM COMs.  It is my understanding these boot securely, but then somewhere MLO  uboot they switch to nonsecure mode, but I could be wrong.  The point is that were certainly doing this from emnonsecureem but privileged, see below mode.p  pI authored this question, about direct access to the GHBBTB of the A8 branch predictor, if youre curious about what Im looking to do a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25779372writedirectlytotheglobalhistorybufferghborbtbinthebranchpredictorWrite directly to the global history buffer GHB or BTB in the branch predictor of a ARM Cortex A8a p  pNow, all of this will be done from uboot weve got Overo FireSTORM COMs, so luckily I have privileged execution.  No worries there.  And Ive looked at other StackOverflow questions, but there doesnt seem to be anything on how, exactly, to get to secure mode.  All I really wanna do is access some CP15 registers, and then go back to nonsecure mode and potentially repeat the process.p  pIve looked into the SMC instruction, but I cant find any documentation on how to appropriately trap the callwhere the call goes tohow to set that up, etc.p  pIs that information anywherep  pTo recap, heres what I want to dop  precodeFROM PRIVILEGED EXECUTION  Do stuff Tweak GHB  requires secure execution Do more stuff Tweak GHB  Do more stuff ... ... ...

Negative 292 pI have a question about google maps sdk for iOS. i have a little program that use google maps, show user location, can create route between to coordinates, draw polyline. Also i have an array which contain CLlocation variableslat,long of various object in my town. i need to draw on my map only those markerswith coordinates from that array which lie on my waypath that user create to the right. not ob the left side. p  pThe way i did this thing i use simple math. i decode my polyline to an array of coordinates. take two points of polylinefirst and next, made vector AB, and made vector ACwhere P is the point which side i want to detect. then use multiplication of vectors by formula AB  bxaxempyaybyayempxax if AB  0  left side, lt0  right side.p  pSorry for may be bad explanation. Can anybody give an advice how to make it easier, or may be with standard functions of google map sdk.p  pthanx. p

Negative 292 pI am trying to figure out how to add a rule to my web.config so it detects any link that has stronganythingstrong in the url beyond the .com portion  and then does strongnotstrong process the next input condition which detects if the device is mobile and then redirects to m.mysite.com.  p  pFor example here are some example cases I would want it to skip over the mobile redirectp  ul liIf a incoming link is www.mysite.comcouponetcli liIf a incoming link is www.mysite.comc1li ul  pI do want it to redirect to the mobile site in all cases where its just the base domain of www.mysite.com or mysite.com.p  pHere is my current web.config rewrite section.p  precodeltrewritegt   ltrulesgt     ltrule nameMobileRedirect patternSyntaxECMAScript stopProcessingtruegt       ltmatch url. ignoreCasetruegt       ltconditions logicalGroupingMatchAllgt         ltadd inputHTTPCOOKIE patternpersistdesktop1 ignoreCasetrue negatetruegt         ltadd inputHTTPUSERAGENT patternandroidblackberrygooglebotmobileiemobileiphoneipodopera mobilepalmoswebosgt       ltconditionsgt       ltaction typeRedirect urlhttpm.mysite.com appendQueryStringfalse redirectTypeFoundgt     ltrulegt   ltrulesgt codepre  pp  pSo my best guess is that I need to add another condition above the other two.

Negative 292 pIm trying to implement Hadoop on a single node pseudo distributed.

Negative 292 pI am making an android app using LibGdx where a colored tile is put in the center of the screen and you have to swipe to to the left, right, top, or bottom, based on the color. Since android has so many screen sizes, it came to my attention that it wouldnt be fair to have the same speed of movement for the tile. On bigger devices, it would take more time for the tile to reach its destination. Basically, I want to calculate a speed that will move my tile from the center of the screen to the left, right, top, or bottom, in the same amount of time as my TIME variable. The TIME constant is set to 0.5 . Anyone have any idea on how I could calculate the speed I need at runtime for each screen size Thanks so much.p

Negative 292 pUsing the new api.mendeley.com api, how do you get all documents of a user, i.e., the ones that appear in his My Publications folder When I use codeGET documentscode I get all documents, not just the ones authored by the user. If I then filter down to only those results that have codeauthored truecode, then I do only get documents authored by the user, but I seem to be missing a lot.p  pI think the answer is related to the question How do I retrieve documents beyond the 500 count limit. I dont see a codestartcode or codeoffsetcode parameter that is usually used for pagination. Clearly this would be the culprit for the question at hand if a user has more than 500 documents.p

Negative 292 pIm currently working on an app that has some legacy Flash pages. We recently added a dropdown in the header that opens into a scrollable div. The header and dropdown are HTML.p  pHeres a wireframe to illustrate the setup.p  pa hrefhttpswireframe.cc27ahkk relnofollowhttpswireframe.cc27ahkkap  pWe ran into an issue where using the scroll wheel while hovering in the dropdown did not behave as desired.p  ul liDropdown does not scrollli liFlash content scrolls insteadli ul  pI expected this was because, as part of Flashs processing of the wheelmousewheel events, it was preventing bubbling and preventing the default action. I did some initial tests in Chrome and found that any event listeners I attached to the bubble phase were in fact not called.p  pMy solution was to attach a wheelmousewheel event listener to the window on the capture phase. In that handler, if the mouse is hovering over our dropdown, I call codeevent.stopPropagationcode to prevent the event from ever reaching Flash thus allowing the default action to occur. Roughlyp  precodewindow.addEventListenerwheel, function event       if .dropdownselectorhover.length  0          event.stopPropagation      , true codepre  pThis event is removed when the dropdown closes.p  pThis worked fine in Chrome, and it works in IE as long as you fall back to the deprecated mousewheel event instead of using the more modern wheel event. Firefox, however, is a different story.p  pWhile Firefox supports the wheel event, it seems that the way in which events are sent to Flash from the browser is entirely different.p  pIf you are hovering over the dropdown and scroll with the mouse wheelp  ol liThe handler will fireli liThe codeifcode condition properly detects the hoverli licodeevent.stopPropagationcode is calledli liHowever, Flash content still scrollsli liDropdown div does not scrollli ol  pEven stranger, if you are not hovering over the dropdown and you scroll with the mouse wheelp  ol liThe handler never firesli liFlash content scrollsli ol  pThis is different than the observed behavior in Chrome and IE, where scrolling while hovering over Flash will still fire the handler, but since the mouse is not over the dropdown, codeevent.stopPropagationcode is never called and thus it captures down to Flash where the event will be handled.p  pThis is confusing to me because I attached the listener to the codewindowcode in capture phase, so I should be receiving the event before anything else on the page. But in Firefox, it appears that either Flash gets the events even before codewindowcode, or Flash receives a different event altogether Flash appears to receive these events even if the JavaScript is stopped on a breakpoint in the debugger.p  pDoes anyone have experience with Flash and Firefox and have a better understanding of how the browser sends events to embedded Flash content Why does my strategy work in all the other browsers but fall short in Firefox Any possible workarounds before we try to delve into the Flash code itself to work on a solutionp  pThanksp
Negative 292 pWe are in the process of setting up a web application start up at present. The web application will quickly grow in terms of number of JSON files that it needs to handle. We are probably talking about 510 million files. The individual JSON files are not particularly large  maybe in the region of 150K per file. Files will unlikely be accessed concurrently so individual users have their set of individual files. p  pThe question I would like to put out there is simply how to best store the JSON files. Is a CDN best where links are stored in a relational database Or should I jump on the bandwagon and go down the route of a NoSQL database Or maybe there are other solutions I havent thought aboutp  preally looking for some good advice, ideally from someone with experience about large databases.p  pMany thanks in advancep  pMarkusp

Negative 292 pSay I have 4 classes codeFoocode, codeBarcode, codeQuxcode, and codeBazcode. I also have an interface codeIFubarcode.p  pThe classes inherit from one another like sop  precodeBar  Foo, IFubar  Qux  Baz, IFubar codepre  pThe methods in codeIFubarcode will almost always be implemented the same way, no matter what class is inheriting them. The ideal solution would be to have the implementation in codeIFubarcode itself, but I cant change codeIFubarcode to a class because codeBarcode and codeQuxcode emhaveem to inherit from codeFoocode and codeBazcode, respectively, and C doesnt support multiple inheritance.p  pIs there an easy way to have some sort of default logic in an interface, for lack of a better term Right now my implementation is just a call to a static method in another class, which allows me to perform all my logic there and minimize code duplication. I feel like thats not an elegant solution, however.p  pIdeally, Id like to have a class derive from some class and codeIFubarcode and have it automatically get the same codeIFubarcode implementation without me having to copy and paste. Im fairly certain that sort of thing isnt possible with C, but I want to make sure.p  pHonestly, its nothing more than a mild annoyance that I have to copy and paste the same code over and over again, but Ive been trying to think of a more elegant solution and I cant.p  pThis would all be for something used in the Unity3D engine, so a hrefhttpdocs.unity3d.com410DocumentationScriptReferenceMonoCompatibility.html relnofollowIm limited to things in .NET 3.5, mostly.ap  pDoes anyone have any better solutions or suggestionsp

Negative 292 pI have written python 2.7.3 code wherein I aim to create a weighted sum of 16 data sets, and compare the result to some expected value. My problem is to find the weighting coefficients which will produce the best fit to the model. To do this, I have been experimenting with scipys optimize.minimize routines, but have had mixed results. p  pEach of my individual data sets is stored as a 15x15 ndarray, so their weighted sum is also a 15x15 array. I define my own model of what the sum should look like also a 15x15 array, and quantify the goodness of fit between my result and the model using a basic least squares calculation.p  precodeRnp.sumnp.absmodelnp.maxmodelmyresult2 codepre  pmyresult is produced as a function of some set of parameters wts. I want to find the set of parameters wts which will minimise R.p  pTo do so, I have been trying this p  precoderes  minimizegetbestweightings,wts,boundsbnds,methodSLSQP,optionsdispTrue,eps100 codepre  pWhere my objective function isp  precodedef getbestweightingswts   wtstrwts[016] wtstiwts[1632]  for i,j in enumerateportlist      originalwtsr[j]wtstr[i]     originalwtsi[j]wtsti[i]  realwtsoriginalwtsr imagwtsoriginalwtsi  myresultmakeweightedbeamrealwts,imagwts,1  Rnp.sumnp.absmodelbeamnp.maxmodelbeammyresult2  return R codepre  pThe input wts is an ndarray of shape 32,, and the output, R, is just some scalar, which should get smaller as my fit gets better. By my understanding, this is exactly the sort of problem Minimization of scalar function of one or more variables. which scipy.optimize.minimize is designed to optimize a hrefhttpdocs.scipy.orgdocscipy0.14.0referencegeneratedscipy.optimize.minimize.html relnofollowhttpdocs.scipy.orgdocscipy0.14.0referencegeneratedscipy.optimize.minimize.htmla .p  pHowever, when I run the code, although the optimization routine seems to iterate over different values of all the elements of wts, only a few of them seem to stick. Ie, all but four of the values are returned with the same values as my initial guess. To illustrate, I plot the values of my initial guess for wts in blue, and the optimized values in red. You can see that for most elements, the two lines overlap.  Imagep  pa hrefhttpimgur.comp1hQuz7 relnofollowhttpimgur.comp1hQuz7ap  pChanging just these few parameters is not enough to get a good answer, and I cant understand why the other parameters arent also being optimised. I suspect that maybe Im not understanding the nature of my minimization problem, so Im hoping someone here can point out where Im going wrong. p  pI have experimented with a variety of minimizes inbuilt methods I am by no means committed to SLSQP, or certain that its the most appropriate choice, and with a variety of step sizes eps. The bounds I am using for my parameters are all 4000,4000. I only have scipy version .11, so I havent tested a basinhopping routine to get the global minimum this needs .12. I have looked at minimize.brute, but havent tried implementing it yet  thought Id check if anyone can steer me in a better direction first. p  pAny advice appreciated Sorry for the wall of text and the possibly probably idiotic question. I can post more of my code if necessary, but its pretty long and unpolished. p

Negative 292 pI have a clientltserver structure that works pretty well for a MUD based game. In general, it works fine, duplicate data is okay and often data being sent can be duplicate data I.E. Attacking a creature several times in a row or casting a heal on yourself multiple times..p  pThe part where duplicate data is not alright is during login. If a user attempts to click the login button very quickly twice, what ends up happening is that it claims the character is already online, because of the first attempt to connect with your credentials, and boots you off the server.p  pTo combat the duplicate message, what Ive done is ensure that the player index connecting is not equal to the index we are currently checking. I.E.p  precodeCheck for duplicate player names... For I  0 To Players.Count  1     If Not IsNothingPlayersI And I ltgt Index Then        If LCasePlayersI.Name  LCaserealname Then        ...Stuff Here to boot player connecting if this goes through        End If     End If Next codepre  pThis works fine, because the person connecting twice is already assigned an index on the first connect, thus I  Index, so the above is okay. However, this doesnt really stop the player from loading a second time, only from ignoring the first character load. Thus the character is loaded twice, and the first is disregarded.p  pIm sure I can also do a check to see if Playersi.Name  The name of the person wanting to connect would mean the player has already been loaded and should ignore the second connect, but I just feel like Im making a hack rather then a solution.p  pI can obviously modify the client to prevent double clicks, like disabling the login button after the first attempt, but this doesnt stop people whom can modify packets. Im not saying its likely, but Id rather most of the security being handled by the server instead.p  pIs there any specific way to prevent this Should it be as simplistic as checking the the player is loaded and ignoring the second message or is there a better way of handling duplicate login messages to the serverp

Negative 292 pI am using the LaunchD Task Scheduler app to schedule jobs on my Mac Mini.

Negative 292 pAfter reading about the Tomcat NIO connector I still dont get one thing is the nio connector beneficial if the application code is blocking, i.e. it blocks on reading from the database, on reading the file system, on calling external web servicesp  pSo, for example, you have a RESTlike API that receives a request, reads something from the database, and returns a response. It doesnt use servlet 3 async, it just writes to the response. p  pI didnt find a full description of the thread pools used by the NIO connector, but I imagine it has a thread pool for handling the requests, so each request ends up in its own thread, which it can block.p  pIf thats the case, are the benefits of NIO still there, or the blocking code diminishes the benefits of NIO in terms of resource utilizationp

Also, I dont know if there is a good way of importingexporting using that technique when im using different subset of settings. If there was a good way of binding to subdictionaries then that could work, but I have not been able to make that work.p  pI could create a Class for each export method and bind the settings to an NSObjectController, and then manually create an import and export method but that felt clunky.p  pNSDictionaryController and NSArrayController only seem to be made for TableViews and that kind of data display, not single user interface elements, at least from what ive been able to test.p  pSo, is there a good way to create an exportimport functionality while still using cocoa bindings, or do i have to create my own methods for thatp  pAny examples or pointers in the right direction is appreciated.p

Negative 292 pTo preface, Im no DBA or SQL expert. But Ive taken on a personal project that requires me to wear all hats in making a social network. No, Im not trying to reinvent Facebook. Im targeting a niche audience. And yes, Ive heard of frameworks such as a hrefhttpactivitystrea.ms relnofollowhttpactivitystrea.msa, but I feel like data serialization should be a last resort for my needs.p  pAnyway, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1443960howtoimplementtheactivitystreaminasocialnetworkHow to implement the activity stream in a social networka helped me get the ball rolling, but I have some unanswered questions.p  pBelow is my database schema some rows have been omitted for simplificationp  pstrongAction tablestrongp  precodeid    name  1     post 2     like 3     follow 4     favorite 5     tag 6     share codepre  pstrongActivity tablestrongp  precodeid             int userid        int actionid      tinyint targetid      int objectid      tinyint datecreated   datetime codepre  pThe codeobjectidcode refers to which object type the codetargetidcode is.

Im not entirely familiar with how codeJOINScode work, and whether SQL is smart enough to only scan the appropriate codeobjectcode table for each codeactivitycode row, rather than ALL the joined tables.p  pOf course the first solution means MANY more calls to the database, which is less desirable. However, Im not sure how else I could retrieve all the relevant columns e.g., codemediacode source, codeeventcode address in just one query without implementing some conditional logic.p

Negative 292 pI am working with a screen that needs to perform a payment based on the selected strongPayment Methodsstrong exposed with a checkbox for each one as you can see in the following mockup.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com28W7H.png altenter image description here The most important thing, is that every empayment methodem has its own logic based on the API that each provide to us where some of them need to redirect a URL for login on their site i.e. PayPal, and some others only to specify some credentials and execute the payment itself. So, according with this, we have been forced to create a controller for each one in order to delegate the interaction with the user once he chose an option. Being more clearer, it will be something like thisp  precode public class PayPalController  BaseController, IPaymentController       public ActionResult Pay              logic for a pay with PayPal         return ViewPaymentSuccess          public class BankOfNigeriaController  BaseController, IPaymentController       public ActionResult Pay              logic for a pay with Bank Of Nigeria         return ViewPaymentSuccess          public class BankOfAngolaController  BaseController, IPaymentController       public ActionResult Pay              logic for a pay with Bank Of Angola         return ViewPaymentSuccess          public interface IPaymentController       ActionResult Pay   codepre  pFocused on the view that I exposed on the top, I am wondering which is the best practice to call the proper action method.p  pstrongemOption 1emstrong consists on create a middle controller that redirects to the proper action.p  pstrongThe ViewModelstrong has an string that it will be used for the redirect URL as selected option.

Negative 292 pI am trying to do a codeCollection Viewcode whereby someone selects a codecellcode and for each selection it takes them to another codeView Controllercode that holds content of the selection. However Im running into difficulties as once I apply this line of code to codedidSelectItemAtIndexPathcode p  precodeself.performSegueWithIdentifershowDetail, sender self codepre  pand then run it in the Simulator the codecellcode selection is working according the codeindexPathcode but its remembering the selections each time I select new codecellcode. So for example each codecellcode has a photo and label and if I select the first codecellcode in the codeindexPathcode the codeseguecode takes me first to blank view and then to my selected codecellcode. If I select another codecellcode, number 3 on the codeindexPathcode the blank view is now the first codecellcode from my previous choice after which it takes to my selected third codecellcode . Its doing that every time. If I remove the codeperformSegueWithIdentifercode code from Xcode 6.2 in 6.1.1 it was random the selection is my previous choice and never my selectedCell, but then at least its only selecting once instead of twice to get to a codeviewcode.

Negative 292 pI have started to use angular with bower to manage some dependencies and gulp as a task runner. I asked a friend to clone and test my app today and he ran into some issues with setting up my app when it comes to installing dependencies.  I had him npm install and bower install but I was assuming that he had bower and gulp installed globally. Do bower and gulp need to be installed locally and added to the package.json  given the fact that if you install it via package.json, it puts the executable in .nodemodules.binbower so you cant type bower install. What is the best way of handling this. Thanksp

Negative 292 pOn developing frontendstuff in scss and html5 I have some routines that I rely on like displayinlineblock, rgba, cssgradients and so on.p  pNow dependent on which project I have, browser demands change. I sometimes need to deliver something workable for IE7 and sometimes IE10 is alright too.p  pOf course I can and do real browser checks to check issues, but I thought having a routine upfrontal check wouldnt hurt.  So I could run a search within my scssfiles to check for the pattern rgba and replace it with something appropriate. But that doesnt sound neither very reliable nor modern to me. p  pIsnt there a way to generate a special set of patternfixes for each browser  run it  highlight it to me or even better already fix itp  pWould gruntgulp be the topic I need to investigate therefore further Thanksp

Negative 292 pIm having a big problem with androidintellijgradle that Im hoping someone can help me with. I have an external library that I wrote and I have it imported into an android project. The external library was first compiled with java 1.8 and I got a codeunexpected top level exception bad class file magic version 0034.0000code error. After reading through various Stackoverflow questions like [this][1], and getting no where with the problem, I realized that the external library had to be compiled using JDK 1.7 which I then did.  brNow this initial error, I believe, was based on an exception that I wrote that one of my classes throws. For some reason the unexpected top level exception was pointing to a an error parsing my exception class which extends Exception. This isnt anything big, its simply, p  precodepublic class MyException extends Exception public MyExceptionString msgsupermsg codepre  pAfter compiling with 1.7, I no longer receive the error. How ever I am now getting a verify error and it seems to only be getting called when I instantiate a class that throws an exception. I have a simple java bean in the external library with getters and setters, and an enum and both work in the android app without issue. p I also tried to store the jar file in the libs directory to see if that would solve the problem, but I get nothing. p Is there some sort of issue with android and custom exceptions p Edit I tried copying the class files into the android project and the original issue goes away. The only new thing that arises is that I get a an error from Jackson codeDidnt find class org.joda.convert.ToString on pathcode. I could probably fix this and use a different JSON library, but I would like to avoid using the class files in this project directly and would prefer to use it as an external jarp
Negative 292 pIm working on an existing C codebase that happens to use codeSIZEMAXcode in a couple of places. I did some refactoring and now codeSIZEMAXcode is not defined in one of the modules.

The example he uses only retrieves information from the object.p  pMy questions are Does this constructor pattern allow appending data to such data structures If it doesnt and Crockford says we need to avoid this and new what options do I havep  pedit linked list code so farp  precodevar linkedList  function spec      var that        that.addNode  function newNode          if spec.size ampamp spec.root               not sure          else               not sure yet                    that.getRoot  function           return spec.root  for an idea of how to retrieve           return that    how Id like to use the list var firstNode  nodeval 25, next null var myList  linkedListroot firstNode, size 1 var secondNode  nodeval 33, next null myList.addsecondNode  I feel this isnt possible codepre

Is it possible that the double image is just a replicate of the image so that it fills the space, or could it be doubled due to an alignment issuep  pUsing the Pleora code, I am able to connect to the camera and start streaming.  Inside this section of the code, I attempt to write the buffer to a bmp file with mixed results. The attached image is an example of the output I get img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhmzQb.png altenter image description herep  pI am using a 32bit RGB pixel type to get this image. Reversing it to BGR works if I switch the output from the camera as well, but other pixel specifications just give constant grey images as output, or ghostly triple images in black and white with many lines.p  pThe code that I think is relevant to understanding how the stream and buffer were created, and the image saved is below please let me know if another section of the code is needed to understand the problem.

This resulted in the green image below. Using his code to get the pixel type, I am led to believe that the pixel type at the time before writing is actually UYVY. The current picture has good point that there is only one image, which seems to confirm dkz s point that a 16 bit image was being mistreated as a 32 bit image, leading to doubling. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.commVt32.png altenter image description herep

Negative 292 pI have this code that I need to rewrite and make a little prettier. It reads lines from a config.txt file and sets variables based on the contents of the file. As you can see, the code is ugly in many ways. There is a lot of duplicated code and the way the program checks the contents of the file is not very elegant it should probably iterate over the lines instead of checking if the file contains a specific text. Overall, I think it would be nice to avoid having a huge wall of ifelse blocks, which actually continues further down but I felt no need to include all of it.p  pAll the program code is written in one main method and I would like to create some classes.

Negative 292 pI am porting a multiplatform project to Windows Phone 8.1 ARM platform. And I am facing a problem with fdwrite event.

On Windows it works fine, same for the Windows Phone emulator. Where could be the cause of this Is it something in my code, or something related with Windows Phone system itselfp  pIt is worth noting that if I go step by step trough this code it always works fine, regardless commenting the sleep line.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pInside waitOnSock functions I am using select to determine if a socket is ready to write, and inside waitOnSockets WSAEnumNetworksEvents functions is used to check if any networks events was issued.

Negative 292 pi have some problem with my app. Here is it, its exactly not an error but i think this one need fixed for the best experience of my app. On my app, there are a datepicker which used by user to select some date ddmmyyyy and the app will save them to the database. Its running well, i can insert and select the Date to and from database. But what i confuse is why the Date formatted in a strange words I have read some books about datetime but still i cant find any way how to make my Date formatted in ddmmyyyy and show it on the list view. i use Calender.getcalender to call the datepicker.p  pdate column on the database now just contain value 2039 or 2040 etc and not 17082015 for example.p  pI dont know what to do, please master help me to solve this problem.

Negative 292 pIn domain driven design domainlayer is said to be having no dependency with other layers. i.e. Repository interface is with domain layer while the implementation is at infrastructure layer.p  pHowever the bounded context with domain  infra is deployed as one unit deployable. And the layers are actually LOGICAL and not PHYSICAL. Then what is th real advantage of drawing this virtual layerseparator between domain and infrastructurep  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIn traditional layered approach domain service is said to be dependent on infra layer. However when it comes to DDD clean hexagonal architectures domain is independent of other layers. However event with clean hexagonal approach still domain layer is having an interface which is implemented by infra layer.p  pTherefore whether you use DDD hexagonal or traditional layered approach, you still have to mock repositories and etc. i.e. domain is not actually independent.

Negative 292 pEDIT adding that this problem seems to be strictly related to making these calls from within an RPC process to the title.  I thought I was going to be required to use RPC to do what I was doing but was mistaken.br After pulling my code out of that process and running from the server it works as expected.  I have decided to leave the question rather than delete it in case anyone else might find the comments of use.p  pJust as the title suggests, CalledProcessError is not triggering my except block when a subprocess checkcall fails.p  pMy code is fairly straight forward, I have a UNC path that I want to mount to a local directory.  if it does not exist, we create it and mount it.  we then push exportfile to a subdirectory on the mounted share that we create if needed.  If any of these operations fail we want to log it and fail out.  Finally, we unmount the share.p  pI attempted making one call using ampamp separators but this only seemed to convolute things when things went wrong.  After separating all the operations into their own calls using subprocess.checkcall I am getting the results I want for known good situations, the problem is that I want to reuse this code as a test for mountability by setting exportfileNonep  pThe code is as followsp  precodedef exportbackuplocaldir, remotedir, creds, exportfileNone          process for testing UNC path mountability and for exporting file to UNC path     param localdir path for local dir to be used as mount point     param remotedir UNC for remote path to mount to local dir     param creds dictionary with keys username, domain, and password set value to None if nonexistent     param exportfile path to file for exporting, set to None to simply test mountability of remotedir          try          in case we failed to unmount for whatever reason         if os.path.ismountlocaldir              unmount existing mount             subprocess.checkcall[sudo, umount, l, localdir]         elif not os.path.isdirlocaldir              create new directory             subprocess.checkcall[sudo, mkdir, localdir]          mount path         cmd  [sudo, mount, t, cifs]          build creds         credstring  ,.join[01.formatkey, value for key, value in creds.items if value]         if credstring             cmd.extend[o, credstring]         cmd.extend[remotedir, localdir]         subprocess.checkcallcmd         if exportfile             exportdir  os.path.joinlocaldir, 0applexport.formatgethostname             newfilename  os.path.joinexportdir, os.path.basenameexportfile             if not os.path.isdirexportdir                  create subdirectory                 subprocess.checkcall[sudo, mkdir, exportdir]              export file             subprocess.checkcall[sudo, cp, exportfile, newfilename]     except Exception as ex         logger.exceptionuappliance.rpc.exportbackup.error, causeex         raise ex     finally          unmount         subprocess.checkcall[sudo, umount, l, localdir] codepre  pI can make my own checks for if operations have actually succeeded or failed by making calls likep  precodeif not os.path.ismountlocaldir     raise ExceptionFailed to mount codepre  pAfter running my subprocess commands... and this works, but this seems broken and backwards.p  pFrom everything that I have read and even tested in python shells, checkcall should raise a CalledProcessError if something exits with a nonzero return code, but for some reason I cannot understand they are not triggering for me here.p  pan example of a bad call I have tried would bep  precodesubprocess.checkcall[sudo, mount, t, cifs, o, usernamesomethingbad,passwordsomethingwrong,domainthisisrightforsomereason, destinationdoesntexist, mntexport] codepre  pfrom the shell this tells me could not resolve address for destination Unknown error and then feeds me the CalledProcessError traceback.

Negative 292 pI have been looking for an image editing SDK for Android, something that includes an option for custom stickers. A good example would be the a hrefhttpscreativesdk.adobe.comindex.html relnofollowAdobe Creative SDK a previously the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.aviary.com relnofollowAviary SDKa, though the current build only supports customizing which features to include, with no option to add your own stickers. Another good example would be the a hrefhttpdevelopers.fotor.com relnofollowFotor SDKa, which did support adding your own stickers, but it is now under development, with no way of accessing the previous version that I know of. p  pThere are a few more editing SDKs available, including the a hrefhttpswww.photoeditorsdk.com relnofollowPhotoEditor SDK by img.lya and a hrefhttpsgithub.comyackleCLImageEditor relnofollowCLImageEditora, but only for iOS. If anyone knows of an Android editing SDK with a sticker feature, or if someone could point me toward some decent resources on the subject which I have not been able to find so I can create my own, it would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 292 pI have a portable class library which I would like to be able to access the resources resx of the assembly that is using it.p  pMy approach so far has been to try to get a ResourceManager and pull the text from there  if the resource isnt there, the library will add its own default text.  In order to get a ResourceManager, I need to get a handle on the assembly, however I have no access to most of the methods you would expect to do this in a PCL.  My attempts so far have only given me the Library assembly, not the caller.p  pIs there another approach or a technique to get the calling assembly from a PCLp  pI am aware of a workaround where you can force the user of the library to provide an assembly name when building a class, however most of my methods are static extensions so that doesnt help in my case.p  pThank youp
