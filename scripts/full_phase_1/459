Positive 459 pTo communicate with each other using emails users do not need to use the same provider some user might use gmail, other yahoo or hotmail and they still can write emails to each other. Unfortunately, it is not like that with social networks. Users using Facebook cannot see posts, comments, likes and shares of the users using Google and vice versa.p  pBut why it should be like that Let us imagine the following architecture. Each user can broadcast using any provider heshe likes. RSS format provide this possibility. Any user can choose any provider to generate hisher RSS feed and to see RSS feeds of user that heshe is subscribed to. So, just by using RSS as it is we can already build a distributed Twitterlike system you can post, you can follow other but you cannot share.p  pWhat is still missing in this approach is a possibility to comments other posts liking, disliking or rating could also be considered as comments. In theory one can publish  broadcast comments in the same way as posts. In fact comments are also posts, the only difference is that they are attached to other posts. So, one could generate RSS like XML in which some posts those that are comments have additional tag that contains URL of the post that is commented.p  pWith such a small extensions of RSS one can build a distributed social network or distributed social news system like Reddit.p  pIs there something developed in this directionp

Negative 459 pThis might be a stupid question but if theres a better or proper way to do this, Id love to learn it.p  pI have run across this a few times, including recently, where small spaces show up in the rendered version of my HTML page. Intuitively I think these should not be there because outside of text or entities the formatting of a pages HTML shouldnt matter but apparently it does.p  pWhat Im referring to is this  I have some Photoshop file from the client on how they want their site to look. They want it to look basically pixel perfect to the image in this file. p  pOne of the places in the page calls for a menu bar, where each one does the changing bit on hovering, acts like a hyperlink, etc. In the Photoshop file this is one long bar, so a cheap and easy way to do this is to just split that segment into multiple images and then place them next to each other in the file. p  pSo instinctively I lay it out like so theres more to it but this is the gistp  precodelta hrefpage1.htmlgtltimg srcimage1.png gtltagt lta hrefpage2.htmlgtltimg srcimage2.png gtltagt lta hrefpage3.htmlgtltimg srcimage3.png gtltagt codepre  pand so forth. p  pThe problem is the images have this tiny space between them which is unacceptable since the client wants this thing pixelperfect and it just plain looks bad.p  pOne way to get it to render properly is to remove the carriage returns between the imagesp  precodelta hrefpage1.htmlgtltimg srcimage1.png gtltagtlta hrefpage2.htmlgtltimg srcimage2.png gtltagtlta hrefpage3.htmlgtltimg srcimage3.png gtltagt codepre  pWhich makes the images go right up against each other the desired effect but it makes the line incredibly long and the code more difficult to maintain it wraps here in SO and this is a simplified version  the real one has longer filenames and JavaScript sprinkled in to do the hovering.p  pIt seems to me that this shouldnt happen but it looks like the carriage return in the HTML is being rendered as a small empty space. And this happens in all browsers, looks like.p  pAm I right or wrong for thinking the two snippets above should render the same And is there something Im doing wrong Maybe saving the file with the wrong encoding Should I make every one of these links a perfectly positioned CSS element insteadp

Negative 459 pstrongEDITstrong emSolution Foundem See my post below.p  pWe are writing a library that reads in a TIF file from a scanner. Basically, its a scantron. We are examining the form and reading values from it. p  pCurrently we have a windows test app, and we give it a filepath as a string ctestingimage.tif. It loads up the tif, reads the document correctly and parses the values.p  pWe also have an ASP.NET web application. We have a test page that does exactly what the windows app does, we hand it an identical string, and i calls the same function on the same class from the same library. It however does NOT read the form correctly. We have verified that it does it fact load up the tif file, and it is actually filled with data pixels we expect to be whiteblack are whiteblack when we examine the Bitmap obect in the immediate window of Visual Studio.p  pThe specific problem is in a library called strongDataMatrixstrong we use to scan a barcode off the document. This function is supposed to return a codeListltstringgt,code each of which is a barcode the library found on the document. In the windows app, this function DataMatrixDecoder.DecodeBarcodebitmap correctly returns with a Count1. When using the asp.net app, this returns with Count0. p  pBecause its the exact same image file, I cannot imagine the problem is in DataMatrix. I can only assume its something with ASP.NET or something. p  pThis isnt even my project, but another guy and I are helping our coworker figure this out, and we are just pulling our hair out. All signs indicate that ASP.NET is correctly loading and handing the image off disk to the processor class which is a class library that uses the DataMatrix stuff, we are not doing ANY code in ASP.NET except for openinghanding the file to the function..p  pDoes anyone have any ideas as to what it might be, or different things we can checkp  pIm not even sure what kind of information to give so I tried to say it all, if you have any questions please ask Id be more than happy to elaborate on anything. Thanks.p  pedit this is the code on the ascx.cs codebehind, in a buttonclick eventp  precodeif formReader.ReadTIFFctestingimage.tif      messages.Controls.AddHtmlHelper.DivSuccessRead successful.  codepre  pThe codeformReadercode class then open the file with a codeFileStreamcode, and uses that to create a codeBitmapcode. The ASP.NET application is not actually opening the file at all we were uploading it through a codeFormUploadcode control, but after experiencing problems we dummied it down to this. This is the most perplexing thing, that it works in the windows app but not from this web site. ASP.NET has full permissions on that folder to do whatever it wants. It can open the image fine, and the bitmap it creates from the FileStream is the actual image.p  pedit Also, the ReadTIFF function right now copies the FileStream into a MemoryStream, ensuring its a not a problem streaming from disk the entire file is in memory.p

Negative 459 pIve got a situation with a large internal corporate web based application running ASP.NET 3.5 on IIS6 generating 401 Unauthorised responses followed by 200 Ok responses as profiled by Fiddler. Im aware of why this happening integrated auth forcing the browser to resend credentials but Im looking for some thoughts on how to minimise or eradicate the situation. The application in question is running in the WAN with some users experiencing latency of up to 250ms so forcing a subsequent request can have a noticeable impact on page load time, particularly when there are a number of cascading drop down lists on the pages making.p  pThe users of the application are internal within a managed desktop environment so mechanisms to force the browser to send credentials on the first request is this even possible could be possible from a deployment perspective. This would work for pages requiring the users identity but for resources not requiring authentication WebResource.axd, ScriptResource.axd and some custom web services, allowing anonymous auth would be possible. Ive looked at defining this on a per location basis in the web.config but the results were mixed still a number of 401 responses.p  pId appreciate any guidance on a best practice for dealing with this situation. There are a lot of resources out there identifying the problem but none that Ive found providing a feasible solution.p  pThanksp  pEdit Resources not requiring authentication i.e. web services used for cascading drop down lists can be requested anonymously through adding a location entry to the web config but Im yet to find an answer for authenticated resources.p

The   Unicode definition of letters includes   Latin characters from a through z,   from A through Z, and also letter   characters from other languages.     The underscore , at sign , or   number sign .br Certain symbols   at the beginning of an identifier have   special meaning in SQL Server. A   regular identifier that starts with   the at sign always denotes a local   variable or parameter and cannot be   used as the name of any other type of   object. An identifier that starts with   a number sign denotes a temporary   table or procedure. An identifier that   starts with double number signs    denotes a global temporary object.   Although the number sign or double   number sign characters can be used to   begin the names of other types of   objects, we do not recommend this   practice. Some TransactSQL functions   have names that start with double at   signs . To avoid confusion with   these functions, you should not use   names that start with .li   liSubsequent characters can include the following    Letters as defined   in the Unicode Standard 3.2.

Negative 459 pI just started using mock objects using Javas mockito in my tests recently.  Needless to say, they simplified the setup part of the tests, and along with Dependency Injection, I would argue it made the code even more robust.p  pHowever, I have found myself tripping in testing against implementation rather than specification.  I ended up setting up expectations that I would argue that its not part of the tests.  In more technical terms, I will be testing the interaction between SUT the class under test and its collaborators, and such dependency isnt part of contract or the interface of the classp  pConsider that you have the following When dealing with XML node, suppose that you have a method, codeattributeWithDefaultcode that returns the attribute value of the node if its available, otherwise it would return a default valuep  pI would setup the test like the followingp  precodeElement e  mockElement.class  whene.getAttributeattribute.thenReturnwhat whene.getAttributeother.thenReturnnull  assertEqualsattributeWithDefaulte, attribute, default, what assertEqualsattributeWithDefaulte, other, default, default codepre  pWell, here not only did I test that codeattributeWithDefaultcode adheres to the specification, but I also tested the implementation, as I required it to use codeElement.getAttributecode, instead of codeElement.getAttributeNode.getValuecode or codeElement.getAttributes.getNamedItem.getNodeValuecode, etc.p  pI assume that I am going about it in the wrong way, so any tips on how I can improve my usage of mocks and best practices will be appreciated.p  pEDIT strongWhats wrong with the teststrongp  pI made the assumption above that the test is a bad style, here is my rationale.p  ol lipThe specification doesnt specify which method gets called.  A client of the library shouldnt care of how attribute is retrieved for example, as long as it is done rightly.  The implementor should have free reign to access any of the alternative approaches, in any way he sees fit with respect to performance, consistency, etc.  Its the specification of codeElementcode that ensures that all these approaches return identical values.pli lipIt doesnt make sense to refactor codeElementcode into a single method interface with codegetElementcode Go is quite nice about this actually.  For ease of use, a client of the method should be able to just to use the standard codeElementcode in the standard library.  Having interfaces and new classes is just plain silly, IMHO, as it makes the client code ugly, and its not worth it.pli lipAssuming the spec stays as is and the test stays as is, a new developer may decide to refactor the code to use a different approach of using the state, and cause the test to fail  Well, a test failing when the actual implementation adheres to the specification is valid.pli lipHaving a collaborator expose state in multiple format is quite common.  A specification and the test shouldnt depend on which particular approach is taken only the implementation shouldpli ol

Negative 459 pHow can I resize an image using HTMLCSS only i.e no server code while keeping its proportions and have a crop effect. Details I wish to resize it to a specified width, keep the proportions and if the height is bigger than a specified value to crop it to the specified height p  pActually, I know how to do that using some server code but I dont want to do this. It would imply using a different file reference and refer the picture something like codeltimg srcpicture.php gtcode. I need to process the image in the same page that displays it.p  pWhat bothers me is that I have to send the image header so nothing else on the page will be displayed.p  pIs there a way to do something like that Maybe from pure HTMLCSS Pp  pI made a function that does something like that except that crop thing and it returns just codewidth heightcode and I use it like this codeltimg srcimage.jpg resizeimage.jpg gtcode, but I dont get how can i do that crop...p  pThanksp

Negative 459 pWere considering using UUID values as primary keys for our MySQL database. The data being inserted is generated from dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of remote computers and being inserted at a rate of 10040,000 inserts per second, and well never do any updates.p  pThe database itself will typically get to around 50M records before we start to cull data, so not a massive database, but not tiny either. Were also planing to run on InnoDB, though we are open to changing that if there is a better engine for what were doing.p  pWe were ready to go with Javas Type 4 UUID, but in testing have been seeing some strange behavior. For one, were storing as varchar36 and I now realize wed be better off using binary16  though how much better off Im not sure.p  pThe bigger question is how badly does this random data screw up the index when we have 50M records Would we be better off if we used, for example, a type1 UUID where the leftmost bits were timestamped Or maybe we should ditch UUIDs entirely and consider autoincrement primary keysp  pIm looking for general thoughtstips on the performance of different types of UUIDs when they are stored as an indexprimary key in MySQL.

Try executing this on codecode and it takes forever. Yet if I use say Nautilus or the builtin Java File selection dialog, the tree renders instantly.p  pSo my question is  how can I speed this upp  pThanksp

Negative 459 pIm a c programmer new to objectivec. p  pI created a calculator app that is working fine using a single view.  I have a Calculations class and a ViewController.

Or can I I dont want to have a global lock on the Thread object, since the amount of lock contention would be extreme. Plus, I dont especially care about insertion position, so if I lock each node separately then Schedule could use something like Monitor.TryEnter and just keep walking the list until it finds an unlocked node.p  pOverall, Im not invested in any particular implementation, as long as it meets the requirements Ive mentioned. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thanksp  pstrongEDIT strong The comments indicate that people think Im talking about winapi fibers which Im not. In a nutshell, all I want to do is schedule bits of code to run one after the other on the stronga singlestrong thread. It is similar to the TPL  Async CTP, but AFIK those do not guarantee continuations on the same thread unless it happens to be the UI thread. I am open to alternate suggestions on how to implement the above, but please dont just say dont use fibers.p

Negative 459 pAs far as I understand one of the purposes of adding  move semantics is to optimize code by calling special constructor for copying temporary objects.

Because xy is an rvalue expression, instead of deep copying we can copy only the pointer to the string and the size of the string. But as we know, modern compilers support a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiReturnvalueoptimizationreturn value optimizationa, so without using move semantics our code will not call the copy constructor at all.p  pTo prove it I write this codep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  struct stuff          int x         stuffint xxx         stuffconst stuff amp gxg.x                          stdcoutltltcopyltltstdendl              stuff operatorconst stuffamp lhs,const stuffamp rhs          stuff glhs.xrhs.x         return g  int main          stuff a5,b7         stuff c  ab  codepre  pAnd after executing it in VC2010 and g in optimize mode Im getting empty output. p  pWhat kind of optimization is it, if without it my code still works faster Could you explain what Im understanding wrongp

Negative 459 pI want to keep a large ordered list millions of elements in Google App Engine datastore. Fast insertion is required.p  pThe simplest way would be adding an indexed property or column ordernum representing the order. For example, a list [A, B, C] would be stored like thisp  precodecontent   ordernum     A         1    B         2    C         3   codepre  pHowever, this doesnt give you fast insertion. For example, If I want to insert X after A, I have to renumber B and C to make room for X, i.e., let B become 3, C becomes 4, and X be 2. This would be a disaster if I have millions of elements.p  pI found a feasible solution called gap approach described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions330482bestwaytosaveaorderedlisttothedatabasewhilekeepingtheorderingherea. This approach keeps a gap between adjacent elements. Like thisp  precodecontent   ordernum     A         1000    B         2000    C         3000 codepre  pWhen I want to insert X after A, I can simply add X with its ordernum set to 1000  2000  2  1500, no renumbering required.p  pBut with these gaps becoming smaller, renumbering may be required. My question is, is there any known strategy on renumbering And deciding the size of gapsp  pThanksp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pHeres more detail. Say I have a list of elements in database, and every element has an integer property named mynum. The value of mynum is an arbitrary positive integer. Suppose I have a list [A, B, C, D], and their mynum arep  precode element    mynum        A          5            B          2    C         10    D          7 codepre  pNow, lets define an accum operatorp  precodeaccumn  element[0].mynum  element[1].mynum  ...  element[n1].mynum codepre  pSo the accum values for each element arep  precode element    mynum   accum      A          5        5    B          2        7    C         10       17    D          7       24 codepre  pBut accum values probably should NOT be stored in database because the list is constantly updated. Its better to keep insertion fast.p  pI want to design a query which input is an integer xp  precodequeryx  element[i] if accumi1 lt x lt accumi codepre  pFor example, query11 is C and query3 is A.p  pIs it possible to design a datastore schema to make this query fast Or the only way is accumulate it one by one at query time which Im planning to dop

Negative 459 pIm using an opensource API in my Java project and referencing interfaces from it. One interface codeFoocode is used extensively both in the API and in projects that use it.

Negative 459 pSOLVED Im writing an android app that connects to a device through bluetooth using RFCOMM. I use the BluetoothChat example as basis for establishing a connection and everything works perfectly most of the time.

Negative 459 pI was having a discussion with my manager today about the merits of using PHP includes and functions as a template to build websites more quickly and efficiently. He has been using Dreamweaver templates for years and sees it as really the best way to go. I would like to start using some different and more efficient methods for web creation, because we need to get through our projects faster. I would like to know in detail what would make Dreamweaver dwts better than using code to accomplish the same task, or vice versa.p  pHis reasoning isp  ol liWhen you change links on the dwt file, it changes links for every page made from that dwt.li liEven if you move pages around in directories, it maintains links to imagesli liEveryone in the company should do it one way, and this is the way he chose there are two of us, with someone whos just started who needs to learn web design from the beginning, and he plans to teacher her the dwt methodli liIf you edit a site made with a dwt, you cant change anything in the template its grayed out, making it saferli liIf hes building sites with dwt, and Im doing it with PHP includes, we cant edit each others sites. It gets all over the place. When we have new employees in the future, it will get all crazy and people cant make changes to others sites if theyre out of the office.li ol  pIve been studying PHP these days, and am thrilled with how powerful it is for creating dynamic pages. The site in question which sparked this discussion is more or less static, so a dwt would work fine. However, I wanted to stretch my wings a bit, and the code was getting REALLY jumbled as the pages grew. So I chopped off the header, footer, and sidebar, and brought them in to all the pages with a php include, as well as dynamically assigned the title, meta data, and description for each page using variables echoed in the header.The reasons I like this better arep  ol liIts cleaner. If every page contains all the data for the header and footer, as well as the extra tags Dreamweaver throws in there, then I have to sift through everything to find where I need to be.li liIts safer. Its sort of like the above reason dwts are safe, except I do all my code editing in a text editor like Coda. So on occasion I have accidentally deleted a dwtprotected line of code because those rules only apply within dreamweaver. I cant chop off part of the header if I cant see it. Incidentally, this makes it easier to identify bugs.li liIts modern. I look through source when I see great pages made by designers and design firms I admire. Ive never seen dwt tags. I believe by using PHP to dynamically grab files and perform other tasks that keeps me from having to go through and change something on every page, life becomes easier, and keeps things streamlined and uptodate with current web trends and standards.li liIts simple. This should be at the top of the list. Like I said we have to train a new person in how to create for the web. Isnt it much better for her to learn a simple line of PHP and get an understanding for how the language works, rather than learn an entire piece of not exactly userfriendly software just for the purpose of keeping her work the exact same as everyone elses On that note, I believe PHP is a powerful tool in a web designers arsenal, and it would be a sin to prevent her from learning it for the sake of uniformity.li liIts fast. Am I mistaken in my thought that a page build with header and footer includes loads faster than one big page with everything in it Or does that just apply when the body is loaded dynamically with AJAXli ol  pI did extensive searching on Google and Stack Overflow on this topic and this is the most relevant article I could findp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7301576whywouldoneusedreamweavertemplatesoverphporjavascriptfortemplatingWhy would one use Dreamweaver Templates over PHP or Javascript for templatingap  pThe answer is helpful, but I would really like to understand in more detail why exactly we shouldnt switch to a new method if its simpler and has more potential. My manager insists that the result is the same, so if there isnt something that makes me say, oh wow thats amazing and much better, then we should just stay how we are now. p  pI do apologize for the length of this question, but the guidelines asked that I be as specific as possible.p

Is there a similar way to construct a XmlNode object So that I only need to provide the whole piece of string representing my node, and then navigate to the child node of which I need to change the value. Thanksp  pUpdate I am using VB.NET. And there is one problem with namespace when using XElement. In this link a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.xml.linq.xname.aspxY1999 relnofollowXName Classa, it says for C it is recommended to just use overriden add operator to combine element and NS, but for VB, it recommends using Import  at the top in the example outside of a Module. I assume it should also work for Classand then everything will be using this NS automatically. However, this is not the case. For example, if I give p  precode             Dim para As XElement                   ltReportParameter NameHasErrgt                     ltDataTypegtBooleanltDataTypegt                     ltDefaultValuegt                         ltValuesgt                             ltValuegtFalseltValuegt                         ltValuesgt                     ltDefaultValuegt                     ltPromptgtReportParameter1ltPromptgt                 ltReportParametergt codepre  pit will automatically attach my specified and stated as default NS there. But if I use XElement.Parsexml As String, where xml is the same string representing the xml, it wont add this NS at all, which will end up using an empty NS the reason I want to use XElement.Parse is I want to give my customized parameter value there, like  amp MYTYPENAME amp . The second problem is when using JohnD s code, I try p  precodexdoc.Root.ElementsReportParameters.FirstOrDefault codepre  pwhich I assume will also use my declared and default NS, will return nothing, i.e., it searches within empty namespace, but it is actually in the NS I mentioned. p  pAnyone knows that is the reason MS made it so that there is no constructor for XName class, where I can specify a namespace before I use it It says there is only one implicit convert, so when given a string representing the element name in p  precodexdoc.Root.ElementsReportParameters codepre  pit will implicitly generates one XName object to index the search in Elements. But it is really clumsy. p  pLatest update I now found the solution to solve my first problem in my update I am now using XML Literals to create XElement, and it is possible to use expression inside it. So it now looks like thisp  precode Dim paraDefNode As XElement                   ltReportParameter Namelt para.Value gtgt                     ltDataTypegtStringltDataTypegt                     ltDefaultValuegt                         ltValuesgt                             ltValuegtFalseltValuegt                         ltValuesgt                     ltDefaultValuegt                     ltPromptgtReportParameter1ltPromptgt                 ltReportParametergt codepre  pand it will add my specified NS. like I said, XElement.Parsestring wont add it So now I can construct the correct node. For my second problem I still cant figure out I cant navigate to the target node by using the element name since it wont search for correct NS.p  pI will anyway mark JohnD s post as answer since he suggested to use LINQ to XML.p

Negative 459 pAm working my way through the book Beginning iOS 5 Development recently published by Apress. Am on Chapter 4 More User Interface Fun working on a Xcode project called Control Fun. p  pPart of the lesson is about putting two switches onto the view one called leftSwitch, and the other rightSwitch. The instructions tell me to controldrag to the header file, creating two different properties and generating the code for themp  precodeproperty strong, nonatomic IBOutlet UISwitch leftSwitch property strong, nonatomic IBOutlet UISwitch rightSwitch codepre  pThen, one action is created by controldragging beneath the other action outlet code          IBActionswitchChangedidsenderp  pBoth switches use the one outlet because the title is passed left, right is passed over.p  pLater, the book says to take one round rect button and lay it on top of the two switches completely covering them. p  pAfter doing this, I am to controldrag from the round rect button to under the IBOutlet properties, and name this outlet the doSomething button. After doing this, Im supposed to create a new action called toggleControls.p  pMy problem is that when I controldrag to the outlets and actions, and the popup comes up to name them, the Connect button remains grayed out, and I cant complete the action. I can only press Cancel, which means that I cant make the connection. I suspect that IB senses that the round rect Do Something button is covering the left and right switches, and therefore wont let me complete the action. p  pAny suggestions what to dop

Negative 459 pI have an app that populates list views when a view is created.  I would like to be able to navigate with a back button and go back to a previous screen and have the data that was listed still be there.  Is this possiblep  pWhat seems to be happening with basic creation of a back button, is when I press it, the view starts up like it was brand new, expecting data input to populate the list.  Is it possible to have the state of the previous screen saved rather than it be wiped out and have to be repopulated when using a back button  I would rather not have to ping the server I get the data from every time a user presses the back button.  Especially if the data has already been grabbed once already.p  pIn other words, Id like it to work like a web browser, where the state of the screen is saved and pressing back just loads what was there, rather than pinging the website again for all of its data.p  pThanks.p

Negative 459 pI am using a ViewPager so the user can browse through an infinite collection of images that need to be fetched from the Internet.p  pI would not like to change to the nextprevious page, unless its image has already been loaded.

But here, we have two left and two right eyes,  eyes[0] and eyes[3] are the left ones, and eyes[1] and eyes[2] are the right ones.p  pAnd this is my question, now if i have to get only one of the two detected results for both right and left eye, how do i do thatp  pEarlier i thought that eye[i][1] could be used as some kind of score. I didnt have access to the Internet for a while so I assumed that. But its not some quality score, as i just discovered. p  pSo in our case, eyes[0][1] is 13, and eyes[1][1] is 4, eyes[2][1] is 4 and eyes[3][1] is 6. Lets call this Qp  pIn the rest of the detections i saw a pattern that the Q for my other detections was high, usually around 4060 so i thought maybe Q within that range denotes best detection.But as before i said, its not.p  pSo how i do determine which eye in eyes is the best detectionp

Negative 459 pThis is a continuation of the question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9537019keepingpreferredsizesofcomponentsincenterofborderlayoutKeeping preferred sizes of components in center of BorderLayouta, which I dont know how to link from here.  If someone wants to edit in a link and send me a message somehow saying how its done, Id appreciate it.p  pIn that question, I asked and was answered how to keep my components at their preferred sizes, and as an adjunct how to put the panel that is in the center of a BorderLayout in the upper left corner of the center of that layout instead of having it float out to the middle.p  pI simplified my real problem in order to fit it into a question, and now Im having trouble generalizing it.  The following code is similar, except it puts a tabbed pane in the center of the border layout.  p  pIve cut some things out in my app, the tabbed pane is in one half of a split pane, and I have a toolbar above separate borderlayout panel, and navigation buttons below.  I cut all that out of here because I can demo the problem without it, but it does mean I have a reason for using border layout, mostly because the panels in the center of all this are ones that I want to take advantage of any extra space the user has to give them.p  pIn this code, we get the tabbed pane, but the two panels within it float to the middle of their extra space if the window gives it to them.  In one version see the alternate lines near the bottom of the code we get scroll bars for them, and in the other we dont.p  pI would like the components within the tabbed panes to stay their preferred sizes.  This code is doing that now by plopping each pane into a gridbaglayout panel, but that has other effects that I dont want.p  pI would like the contents of each tabbed pane to stay in the upperleft corner of the space if it is larger than the panel needs I would like scroll bars to appear when there isnt enough space.p  pSo are there other opinions on how I might get this donep  precodepackage example  import java.awt.BorderLayout import java.awt.GridBagLayout  import javax.swing.BoxLayout import javax.swing.JComboBox import javax.swing.JFrame import javax.swing.JLabel import javax.swing.JPanel import javax.swing.JScrollPane import javax.swing.JTabbedPane  public class BorderAndBox extends JFrame      public static void mainString args[]              BorderAndBox bnb  new BorderAndBox         bnb.createUI         bnb.setLocationByPlatformtrue         bnb.setVisibletrue           public void createUI              JPanel borderPanel  new JPanelnew BorderLayout          JPanel innerPanelOne  new JPanel         innerPanelOne.setLayoutnew BoxLayoutinnerPanelOne, BoxLayout.LINEAXIS         String[] firstChoices   first, uno, UN          String[] secondChoices   second, dos, zwei          String[] thirdChoices   third, tres, drei          JComboBox firstCombo  new JComboBoxfirstChoices         JComboBox secondCombo  new JComboBoxsecondChoices         JComboBox thirdCombo  new JComboBoxthirdChoices         innerPanelOne.addfirstCombo         innerPanelOne.addsecondCombo         innerPanelOne.addthirdCombo         JPanel innerPanelTwo  new JPanel         innerPanelTwo.setLayoutnew BoxLayoutinnerPanelTwo, BoxLayout.PAGEAXIS         innerPanelTwo.addnew JLabeladditionalLabel          JPanel panelA  new JPanelnew GridBagLayout         panelA.addinnerPanelOne          JPanel innerPanelThree  new JPanel         innerPanelThree.setLayoutnew BoxLayoutinnerPanelThree, BoxLayout.PAGEAXIS         JLabel lblFirst  new JLabelfirst in line         JLabel lblSecond  new JLabelsecond to none         JLabel lblThird  new JLabelthird the bird         JLabel lblFourth  new JLabelfourth         JLabel lblFifth  new JLabelfifth         JLabel lblSixth  new JLabelsixth         innerPanelThree.addlblFirst         innerPanelThree.addlblSecond         innerPanelThree.addlblThird         innerPanelThree.addlblFourth         innerPanelThree.addlblFifth         innerPanelThree.addlblSixth         JPanel panelB  new JPanelnew GridBagLayout         panelB.addinnerPanelThree          JScrollPane scrollPane1  new JScrollPanepanelA         JScrollPane scrollPane2  new JScrollPanepanelB          JTabbedPane tabbedPane  new JTabbedPane         tabbedPane.addone, scrollPane1         tabbedPane.addtwo, scrollPane2           JPanel westPanel  new JPanelnew BorderLayout         JPanel northPanel  new JPanelnew BorderLayout         northPanel.addtabbedPane, BorderLayout.NORTH         westPanel.addnorthPanel, BorderLayout.WEST          the following lines are mutually exclusive           use only the first, you have no scroll bars,          use only the second, you do have them         borderPanel.addwestPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER           borderPanel.addtabbedPane, BorderLayout.CENTER          getContentPane.addtabbedPane         pack          codepre

But I can not listen to any sound like water detection alarm or fire or burglar alarm.p  pIs there any way to listen to live sound coming from the microphone of the home server over the internet  I already have the apache home server for the zoneminder, so, I think it has to be with apache server,  like module since the port 80 bound to apache server can not be shared with other application..   Due to the firewalls at home and work, and due to the single dynamic ip address, I see no other way but with apache server. p  pIf I can embed the audio listening application on the zoneminder web page, it would be most desirable. But, for now, I just want to listen to any sound at home real time anyway I can. Separate application over the internet is fine as long as it is real time and over the port 80 like VNC over SSH.p  pI looked at Icecast2 and Ices, but due to firewalls, it seems difficult or impossible. I considered sox linux application to detect any sound and send the sound file as an email attachment, but it dose not seem to fit my need quite well.p  pI would appreciate very much any suggestions.

Negative 459 pIs there a way to see if assets file changed between application reinstall in Android Something like md5 or timestamp on whole assets folder afaik assets are just a zipped file, so maybe its possible to check just this file for changesp  pWe have an application in which we store configuration xmls in assets folder, then parse them to binary form. As the application is still in development xmls change sometimes. Id like to be able to automatically determine that assets changed, so I can reload xmls to binary form. It is always the case, that we have the same amount of xml files which change their content a little so seeing if file list changed is not enough.p  pI know it would be possible to keep a version number, but if possible, I would like to avoid it because it is error prone and would require some discipline from every programmer.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pFound this answer now a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9231823androidassetstimestamprq1Android assets timestampap  pAs this shows assets timestamp may not be a good idea because it does not reflect asset files timestamp, but rather build time.p
Negative 459 pI am building an WinForms application with a UI that only consists of a codeNotifyIconcode and its dynamically populated codeContextMenuStripcode. There is a codeMainFormcode to hold the application together, but that is never visible.p  pI set out to build this as SOLIDly as possible using Autofac to handle the object graph and am quite pleased with my success, mostly getting along pretty well even with the O part. With the extension I am currently implementing it seems I have discovered a flaw in my design and need to remodel a bit I think know the way I need to go but am a bit unclear as to how to exactly define the dependencies.p  pAs mentioned above, the menu is in part populated dynamically after starting the application. For this purpose, I defined an codeIToolStripPopulatorcode interfacep  precodepublic interface IToolStripPopulator      System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip PopulateToolStripSystem.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip toolstrip, EventHandler itemclick  codepre  pAn implementation of this is injected into the codeMainFormcode, and the codeLoadcode method calls codePopulateToolStripcode with the codeContextMenuStripcode and a handler defined in the form. The populators dependencies are only related to obtaining the data to use for the menu items.p  pThis abstraction has worked nicely through a few evolutionary steps but isnt sufficient anymore when I need more than one event handler, e.g. because I am creating several different groups of menu items  still hidden behind a single codeIToolStripPopulatorcode interface because the form shouldnt be concerned with that at all.p  pAs I said, I think I know what the general structure should be like  I renamed the codeIToolStripPopulatorcode interface to something more specific and created a new one whose codePopulateToolStripcode method does not take an codeEventHandlercode parameter, which is instead injected into the object also allowing for much more flexibility regarding the number of handlers required by an implementation etc.. This way my foremost codeIToolStripPopulatorcode can very easily be an adapter for any number of specific ones.p  pNow what I am unclear on is the way I should resolve the EventHandler dependencies. I think the handlers should all be defined in the codeMainFormcode, because that has all the other dependencies needed to properly react to the menu events, and it also owns the menu. That would mean my dependencies for codeIToolStripPopulatorcode objects eventually injected into the MainForm would need to take dependencies on the codeMainFormcode object itself using codeLazyltTgtcode.p  pMy first thought was defining an codeIClickHandlerSourcecode interfacep  precodepublic interface IClickHandlerSource      EventHandler GetClickHandler  codepre  pThis was implemented by my codeMainFormcode, and my specific codeIToolStripPopulatorcode implementation took a dependency on codeLazyltIClickHandlerSourcegtcode. While this works, it is inflexible. I would either have to define separate interfaces for a potentially growing number of handlers severely violating OCP with the codeMainFormcode class or continuously extend codeIClickHandlerSourcecode primarily violating ISP. Directly taking dependencies on the event handlers looks like a nice idea on the consumers side, but individually wiring up the constructors via properties of lazy instance or the like seems pretty messy  if possible at all.p  pMy best bet currently seems to be thisp  precodepublic interface IEventHandlerSource      EventHandler GetEventHandlerType type  codepre  pThe interface would still be implemented by codeMainFormcode and injected as a lazy singleton, and codeEventHandlerTypecode would be a custom enum with the different types I need. This would still not be very OCP compliant, but reasonably flexible. codeEventHandlerTypecode would obviously have a change for each new type of event handler, as would the resolution logic in codeMainFormcode, in addition to the new event handler itself and the probably newly written additional implementation of codeIToolStripPopulatorcode.p  pOr.... a separate implementation of codeIEventHandlerSourcecode that as the only object takes a dependency on codeLazyltMainFormgtcode and resolves the codeEventHandlerTypecode options to the specific handlers defined in codeMainFormcodep  pIm trying to think of a way of actually getting the event handlers out of codeMainFormcode in a feasible way, but cant quite seem to right now.p  pWhat is my best option here, providing the loosest coupling and most elegant resolution of the different event handlersp  p[Yes, I probably should have left the name alone to really comply with OCP, but it looked better that way.]p

Then in users setting page he can see checkboxes for these settings that are all checked by default. Every time the user creates uncheck one, then I create a new row for that user, action and namespace with the value to be false.p

Negative 459 pI coded a Windows screensaver using CWinAPIs some time ago but now when I try it on Windows 8 at a logon screen when no users are yet logged in it doesnt seem to work. It is clearly a bug in Windows 8, because when I reboot the system my screensaver begins to work just fine. Note that this behavior never happened on any previous version of Windows.p  pWhat happens is that when the screensaver starts, the screen turns black and nothing happens after that moment. Obviously I cant debug it with the Visual Studio, so I added a trace statement into the first line where it should begin executing in WMCREATE in ScreenSaverProc but that line never gets called when the screensaver hangs up like I described above.p  pThis tells me that some initialization code hangs up before the WMCREATE message is sent, but to fix that I do not have access to that code because a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarycc14406628vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowMicrosofts tutorial on WinAPI screensaversa instructs to link to Scrnsave.lib or ScrnsavW.lib in my case.p  pSo I was wondering, is there any way to build a WinAPI screensaver without using Scrnsave.libp

Negative 459 pIm have an NSArray that I need to sort based on variables that are stored inside an object in this case my class name is SchedView which is a UIViewController.  I was thinking NSArray would let me pass it a member function not sure if that is the term used in ObjectiveC or not, Im new to this language.  It appears I can only pass a staticC style function though, so this is what I ended up withp  precode NSInteger BuildGridSortCompare id r1 id r2 void context       Have compare code here, and can use class scope variables...      return NSOrderedSame   NSInteger BuildGridSortCompareid r1,id r2,void context      SchedView sv  bridge SchedView context     return [sv BuildGridSortComparer1 r2 NULL]    voidBuildGrid      Records  [Records sortedArrayUsingFunctionBuildGridSortCompare contextbridge void self]  codepre  pBuildGrid and BuildGridSortCompare are member functions of my SchedView class selectors.  BuildGridSortCompare is basically a C style function that is just a wrapper to call my member function.p  pIve used this design before in CC code, but not in modern platforms such as Java and C, so thought maybe ObjectiveC might have a better wayp  pIm not real sure about some of the typecasts as well, the bridge mostly.p  pIs what I am doing safe, or is there another function similar to sortedArrayUsingFunction that lets me use a member function  I did see sortedArrayUsingSelector, but that appears to call a function on the class I am sorting.

Negative 459 pRecently, I had the need for a function that I could use to guarantee synchronous execution of a given block on a particular serial dispatch queue. There was the possibility that this shared function could be called from something already running on that queue, so I needed to check for this case in order to prevent a deadlock from a synchronous dispatch to the same queue.p  pI used code like the following to do thisp  precodevoid runSynchronouslyOnVideoProcessingQueuevoid blockvoid      dispatchqueuet videoProcessingQueue  [GPUImageOpenGLESContext sharedOpenGLESQueue]      if dispatchgetcurrentqueue  videoProcessingQueue              block          else              dispatchsyncvideoProcessingQueue, block       codepre  pThis function relies on the use of codedispatchgetcurrentqueuecode to determine the identity of the queue this function is running on and compares that against the target queue. If theres a match, it knows to just run the block inline without the dispatch to that queue, because the function is already running on it.p  pIve heard conflicting things about whether or not it was proper to use codedispatchgetcurrentqueuecode to do comparisons like this, and I see this wording in the headersp  blockquote   pRecommended for debugging and logging purposes onlyp      pThe code must not make any assumptions about the queue returned,   unless it is one of the global queues or a queue the code has itself   created. The code must not assume that synchronous execution onto a   queue is safe from deadlock if that queue is not the one returned by   dispatchgetcurrentqueue.p blockquote  pAdditionally, in iOS 6.0 but not yet for Mountain Lion, the GCD headers now mark this function as being deprecated.p  pIt sounds like I should not be using this function in this manner, but Im not sure what I should use in its place. For a function like the above that targeted the main queue, I could use code[NSThread isMainThread]code, but how can I check if Im running on one of my custom serial queues so that I can prevent a deadlockp

Negative 459 pI have always run erlang applications on powerful servers. However, sometimes, you cannot avoid such memory errors, especially when users are manypre Crash dump was written to erlcrash.dump eheapalloc Cannot allocate 467078560 bytes of memory of type heap. pre What makes it more annoying is that you have a server with 20GB of RAM, with say 8 cores. Looking at the memory which erlang says, it could not allocate and that is why it crashed, is also disturbing , because it is very little memory compared to what the server has in stock.brbr My question today i wish it is not closed , is that, what Operating system configurations can be done consider RedHat , Solaris, Ubuntu or Linux in general, to make it offer the erlang VM more memory when it needs it  brbrIf one is to run an erlang application on such capable servers, what memory consideration outside erlang should be made as regards the underlying operating system  brbrbProblem Backgroundbbr Erlang consumes Main Memory, especially when processes are in thousands. I am running a Web service using codeYaws Web Servercode. On the same node, i have Mnesia running with about 3 coderamcopiescode tables. Its a notification system, as part of a larger Web application running on an intranet. Users access this very system via JSONP from the main application running off a different web server and a different hardware as well. Each user connection queries mnesia directly for any data it needs. However, as users increase i always get the codecrash dumpcode. I have tweaked the application itself as much as possible, clean up the code to standard, used more binaries than strings e.t.c. avoided single points like genservers between yaws processes and mnesia, so that each connection, just hits mnesia directly. The server is very capable with lots of RAM and Disc Space. However, my node crashes when it needs a little more memory, thats why i need to find a way of forcing the Operating system to expand more memory to erlang. Operating system is codeREDHAT ENTERPRISE 6codep

Negative 459 pIn my code I have to use several functions as emlambdasem, such as you should provide, for example, to codeqsortcode.br So when I was passing a function of type codeintcode, program was working fine.

Negative 459 pIm writing an app that is a sort of a custom corporate setup. This app does a lot of tasks, some of them requires elevation.p  pI included a manifest so that when the app start the UAC ask user for elevation.p  pOne of these task is mapping some network drives with codeWNetAddConnectioncode to a remote server. These mapping should be persistent. So far so good, except that when the app close, the user cant see the drives the app just mapped.p  pAfter some research a hrefhttpserverfault.coma185885147818httpserverfault.coma185885147818a, I understand that when the user logs in, its session receive 2 tokens, one with low privileges, the other with full privileges, the one that is used to run process when elevation is required.p  pMy question  Is that possible that my app launch a thread that gets the current user filtered token in way a that when the apps tasks are finished, the user can see the network drives in the explorer p  pIs that possible to impersonate the thread with this token p  pIm aware of these possible workaround p  ul liRedesigning the app so that only some specific tasks that do requires elevation would be encapsulated in a COM object.li liTweaking the registry with the codeEnableLinkedConnectionscode setting requires a users session restartli ul  pbut for some reasons, none of these solutions is an option.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 459 pThere are 2 reports that are produced at the end of each day. I would like to be able to perform analysis on them at the end of each month.p  pInside each file is a thousand lines or so of long ASCII strings. This has been successfully coded, but only to extract and perform analysis on one file at a time. p  pIll try and put in the relevant structure of the code below.. I hope this is enough to get an idea of what needs to be done. If not, I am happy to post the entire thing. p  precodeusing StreamReader reader  new StreamReaderYYYYMMDD1234D.dat  while loop this goes through all the lines in the file.  if if meets certain criteria then store into a list, otherwise ignore   foreach  this part does the analysis of all the values in the list, totals, etc codepre  p. p  pThe first report is in the above format, and the other has a different number in place of 1234D for arguments sake,5678D, so yyyymmdd5678D. Both these numbers are constant throughout.p  pId like to be able to have all the data stored into my list from every file, and then perform the analysis on the entire month, rather than have a daily breakdown, so it would loop through each file, when it gets to the end of the file, increment the name by a day, loop through that etc. or find all files with a month of X  whichever is better. This would populate the list, and then the foreach would perform its analysis and output.

Negative 459 pNew to SO my first questionp  pRe Core Data, document based app using bindingsp  pI have an strongNSTableViewstrong bound to an strongNSArrayControllerstrong, bound to an entity, strongLineItemstrong, with several columns bound to the following strongLineItemstrong attributesproperties emamountem, empriceem, and emtotalem. Im using strongkeyPathsForValuesAffectingTotalstrong to observe changes in emamountem and empriceem. The property, emtotalem, updates instantly with any changes.  I have another entity, strongItemstrong. It has a one to many relationship emitemsem with strongLineItemstrong since every strongItemstrong  can have many strongLineItemsstrong. strongItemstrong also has an strongNSTableViewstrong bound to an strongNSArrayControllerstrong, which is bound to its respective entity, strongItemstrong. This table has several columns as well, but one is, emlineItemTotalem items.sum.total.p  precode NSNumber lineItemTotal       float totalOfAllLineItemTotals  [[self valueForKeyPathitems.sum.total]floatValue]      [self willAccessValueForKeylineItemTotal]      return [NSNumber numberWithFloattotalOfAllLineItemTotals]      [self didAccessValueForKeylineItemTotal]      return [NSNumber numberWithFloattotalOfAllLineItemTotals]  codepre  pThe emlineItemTotalem value updates instantly with the use of an strongNSNotificationstrong emNSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChangeNotificationem, which calls my selector, updateLineItemTotal which sends a message [self.view setNeedsDisplayYES]  Everything works fine... However, this view should look like a receipt. As such, I have an NSTextField underneath the strongLineItemstrong Table to show the total, as the user would expect. I have tried binding it to the same strongNSArrayControllerstrong that strongItemstrong is, but this does not work. In the bindings Inspector, I cannot choose strongarrangedObjectsstrong for the strongController Keystrong, since it isnt a table. this is how the Item Table is set up and working fine My only choice is selection for the strongController Keystrong. In any case, it always shows the correct value, but only after I create a new Item instance via strongNSButtonstrong bound to add and return to the old Item instance. It does not update instantly like everything else a user would find this unprofessional. Ive tried the suggestions of Hillegass, searched Stack Overflow, and Apples recommended work arounds regarding updating values when dealing with an strongNSSetstrong. Apple recommends setting up a notification. I did that and this time it didnt work. Ive tried all the obvious workarounds with no success. I believe it comes down to strongKVCstrong amp strongKVOstrong unfortunately, Apple has little support for these powerful tools when working with strongNSSetsstrong, at least not on the surface. Any help would be appreciated. p

Negative 459 pThere is a strange rule in MySql which basically says if you want to create a view and you want to use constructs such as codeGROUP BY, DISTINCT, UNIONcode, etc. in your view, you cannot create your view with codeALGORITHM  MERGEcode Read more a hrefhttpdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.6enviewalgorithms.html relnofollowherea.p  pThis basically means that if you create a view in MySql and you have something like GROUP BY in your view, if you run a query likep  precodeselect  from MyView where foo  2 codepre  pthen MySql will read all the rows from MyView and put it in a temp table and after that it will apply the where clause foo  2 to the temp table and return you the result.p  pThe problem is that if your view has 10 Million rows it will get all the 10M rows and then apply the where clause, which is insanely inefficient. p  pSo, does anyone know what is the rationale behind this I know that MS Sql Server is not doing this and I bet Oracle is not doing it either. p

Then work with this cachedata, for example incrementing the hitsCounter key value, till the client stops doing requests. strongIn parallel, every few minutes a background process persist data from redis cache to db tables, so at the end we have the updated data back to postgresql, and we can deal with them in the future.strongp  pI think it obviously increase performance, but Im not sure about this background process.

Negative 459 pI have gone through the  ADLivelyTableView demo project but have not been able to import the ADLivelyTableView h and m files into my project successfully. It appears that the main issue is to do with ARC. I have experimented by converting the demo project into arc, specifically but converting just the LDMasterView.m file, and this simply removes all references to releasing objects, and so after this conversion, the use ARC option under build settings is now ON and the app works.

Negative 459 pI have an application Ive been wanting to build for almost a year now. I studied programming in high school and college BS IT and find it relatively easy. The hard part for me has been the rest of the software development life cycle. They dont seem to teach that as much in school.p  pIm trying to reach as many platforms as possible. I started coding in JavaScript with the intent to use PhoneGap, but local storage seems tedious and I decided to lean more towards application development than web development. Then I started over with Mono and C and it was great fun and easy. Then I discovered the price tag and I cant afford to buy Xamarin. So, I think, I want to try C and Qt. Qt4 and Necessitas currently allow for Android and Qt5 is supposed to include iOS and Android sometime this year plus all the desktops and loads of embedded systems.p  pNow Im struggling with the idea of unit testing. The Nunit tests for C were super easy to learn and run in both Visual Studio and MonoDevelop. C unit testing seems a little tougher, but I want to be Agile and use TDD. Qt Creator, however, as far as I can tell does not support automated unit tests. Eclipse does have automated unit tests with the CUTE plugin, but the Qt designer plugin for Eclipse has been abandoned. That probably wont help for mobile GUI design as Digia is still working in that arena and the old plugin was made by Nokia.p  pI think I want to put all of my code OOP classes in one library, put all of my unit tests in another library or project, and then create another project for the appmainGUI of each platform that I aim to develop for. Im using freeopen licensing, so Id start a project on SourceForge or something using Git. What Im thinking is that I could use Eclipse to write the code and tests. When I need to do some GUI stuff, push the changes, close Eclipse, open Qt Creator, pull the work I just did in Eclipse and then start playing with the GUI.p  pDoes anyone do this Could this work Is this madness Better ideasp  pp.s. stackoverflow is already warning me that this question appears subjective and is likely to be closed. Im not looking to start a debate. Im just wondering if this idea could work and if there is anything else along these lines immediately coming to mind that I have missed.p

You have your bricks in a txt file in a 10x10 dimensioned matrix. You will catch the brick location and rotate it 90 in clockwise. For simplicity only two kinds of bricks are going to be rotate by your algorithm. They are L character and the inverse of L. From the input file you can take 4 different combinations of this two bricks. Your algorithm must rotate the brick in clockwise and write the result matrix In an output file in the same location of your executable file.

Since I dont know how many widgets will be shown, Im not using the codeltdiv classrowgtcode elements.p  pTo make it a little more difficult Id like to add the accordion class to each widget as well, allowing them to be collapsed independentlyp  pI started by putting everything in a codeltdiv classspan12gtcode element, then adding the span6 elements underneath.p  pInstead of writing everything down here,I created a small example on bootply a hrefhttpbootply.com76472 relnofollowBootply linkap  pHowever for some reason, my span6s are appearing beneath each other, instead of 2x2 next to each other. Also the span6s seem to be too small, since the labels around the texts e.g. 0 Bugs closed and assigned to you, good job dont have rounded corners on the right side.p  pI would be very gratefull if you could go over this code and let me know where I went the wrong way.p  pThanksp

Negative 459 pI start to use C Code Contracts with enabled static and runtime checks. The problem is that some code contract checks may be duplicated from method to method and I see no good way to avoid this.p  pMy hope is to avoid static analyzer warnings at all and dont suppress it if possible.p  pstrongLets consider the examplestrongp  pThere are following simple classes. This is an usual example of business logic model classesp  precodeclass Category      public string Name  get set    class Article      public string Title  get set      public string Content  get set      public Category Category  get set   codepre  pFor some reflectionbased techniques like model binding in MVC, database mapping we need to provide public default constructor and public setters for model properties. So we cant guarantee that for example for Category the Contract.Invariantstring.IsNullOrEmptyName is always true.p  pThen we create the next method in our internal CategoryRepository class. We assume that all validation passed earlier and accept only valid categoriesp  precodepublic void AddCategory category      Contract.Requirescategory  null     Contract.Requiresstring.IsNullOrEmptycategory.Name     ...  codepre  pSo far so good. Then we add similar method to ArticleRepositoryp  precodepublic void AddArticle article      Contract.Requiresarticle  null     Contract.Requiresstring.IsNullOrEmptyarticle.Title     Contract.Requiresstring.IsNullOrEmptyarticle.Content     Contract.Requiresarticle.Category  null     Contract.Requiresstring.IsNullOrEmptyarticle.Category.Name     ...  codepre  pstrongThe problems arestrongp  p1 In every place where we expect a valid Category by contract we need to duplicate checks likep  precodeContract.Requirescategory  null Contract.Requiresstring.IsNullOrEmptycategory.Name codepre  pSometimes we also need to make these checks in Contract.Assume methods.p  p2 External classes like Article should make checks for contracts of Category class.

Negative 459 pIm currently writing a new filter in WEKA. Before applying this filter on a read dataset a few options should be possible to be set. One of them should be the attributes class name. Now the answer is, which variable gives me access to the read dataset BEFORE my processing method which is called when applying the filterp  pIt seems that there has to be an Instances variable with all the information because the WEKA explorer shows all the different classes after opening the file.p

The text First Two appears under the Save button this is correct. Change the dropdownlist value to Second. Uncheck Second One and click Save.

And it might require some more feedback about the actual working. The dropdownlist contains multiple values. Based on this selection, different data is fetched from database. This data is also different in the number of columns that is shown and such. The LoadTable will dynamicaly add this different data to the table. The only thing they have in common, is the use of checkboxes. So a solution should have as minimal changes to the LoadDropDownList and LoadTable functions.p

Negative 459 pemThis is a duplicate question, my apologies everyoneemp  pFirstly, I apologize if this is a simple question, I have been searching for a very long time, and either an answer about this does not exist, the answer I am looking for has been buried under answers to questions about how to convert a string to a byte array, or Im not searching with the right terminology. I have also found a few answers on converting a single hex value into a byte but applying those methods to work with what I want to do doesnt really seem to work very well.p  pWhat I am looking for is not how to convert string to a byte array, rather, I am trying to convert an already in bytes value from a textbox, into something my application will recognize as a byte array. Ill try to explain better with an examplep  precodetextBox.Text  019F314A I want byte[] bytes to equal  0x01, 0x9F, 0x31, 0x4A  codepre  pHopefully that makes sense.

Negative 459 pI need some help as I am a new user to vb.net with enabling a button based on an event. The scenario is I have a listview which populates 100 records at a time based on a access query. There seem to be 2 main areas of coding.p  p1 Enable Next button but only if there are more than 100 records in database. This means that I need to run a query first to get the count of total rows. Store this count in a class level variable and then when you populate the list, if this count is greater than 100 then enable the next button. I also need to maintain the current page number count. When user presses the Next button, it loads next 100 rows and then check if you still need to enable the Next button by checking if PageNumber100 is less than row count.p  p2 A need to enable the Previous button if current page number is not 1. p  pI would be grateful if someone could help with this or point me in the direction for further help.

It draws it in the middle of the screen, like so  a hrefhttpimgur.comXw9Xs9Z relnofollowhttpimgur.comXw9Xs9Zap  pThe large, multicolored sprite that takes up the larger portion of the screen is my background, but it isnt taking up the full space like I want it to.p  pA few things Ive triedp  ul lipChecking, doublechecking, and triplechecking to make sure that the sprites size and the windows size are strongidenticalstrongpli lipResizing the sprite so that it is both larger and smaller than my target size.

Negative 459 pIm in the process of creating a agent bases modelling program. So far I have the relavent classes to model a simulator, grid, different agents etc. Ive also created a 2D array of object e.g. agents moving around the array doing whatever. p  pI am familary with creating simple GUIs but how do I come about creating a panepanel which then is added to the GUI. which shows the 2D array on run time with each object with its corresponding colour. Also I want to try and use the MVC pattern to basically display the simulation data differently. Such as one pane shows the different objects colour and another pane showing the same objects but every objects angry levels with different shades of red. Any guidelines would be really helpful also similar tutorials.p  pThanks p

Negative 459 pI would like to know if there is any CC compiler and editor just like code blocks but you can change the theme and and skin and give it a dark look. I have tried using Code blocks and it was nice except the theme is too plain and it makes it boring. I tried eclipse but I was having trouble compiling using eclipse. So if you know any software that has a built in compiler with it and allows you to change themes and skin please let me know.p

Negative 459 pI have a MVC 3 web application more like a subapplication, really that does not rely on ASPNET for authentication because that is already being used in another area of the app and we are using a different type of credentialing.

The problem I am having is how to return from that Login action back to wherever the user is. When I try return View it understandably tries to return to a HomeLogin view, which doesnt exist.

I succeeded in getting the referral info into my app using Appsflyer for anyone who works with affiliates this is cool and now Im stuck as one of the ways I tried was to store the info using NSUserDefaults in my delegate and call it before I load up the url but it doesnt always finish in time.p  pHere is my viewWillAppearp  precode     void viewWillAppearBOOLanimated              webview.scrollView.bounces  NO        webview.backgroundColor  [UIColor grayColor]        webview.opaqueNO        webview.scalesPageToFit  YES        NSUserDefaults prefs  [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]        NSArray btags  [prefs arrayForKeybanner]        NSLog, btags        NSString neededstring  [btags objectAtIndex0]        NSString ourURL  httpmydomain.comref        ourURL  [ourURL stringByAppendingStringneededstring]        NSLog, ourURL        NSURL url  [NSURL URLWithString ourURL]        NSURLRequest requestObj  [NSURLRequest requestWithURLurl]        NSLogLoading url        [webview loadRequestrequestObj]      codepre  pHere is my AppDelegates onConversionDataReceived methodp  precode    voidonConversionDataReceivedNSDictionary installData        NSUserDefaults prefs  [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]  load NSUserDefaults       id status  [installData objectForKeyafstatus]       if[status isEqualToStringNonorganic]          id pid  [installData objectForKeypid]         id campaign  [installData objectForKeyc]         id landingPage  [installData objectForKeyafsub1]         NSLogNone organic istall pid  campaign landing page, pid, campaign, landingPage         NSLoghere         NSMutableArray tags  [ NSMutableArray arrayWithObjectspid,campaign, nil]  declare array to be stored in NSUserDefaults         [prefs setObjecttags forKeybanner]  set the prev Array for key value favourites       else if[status isEqualToStringOrganic]          NSLogorganic          handle organic install         NSString pid  6544581         NSMutableArray tags  [NSMutableArray arrayWithObjectspid, nil]         [prefs setObjecttags forKeybanner]        else           not expecting to be here       codepre  pAnother thought I had was creating a additional viewcontroller that runs before this viewcontroller but the problem still exists that what happens if the referral info doesnt get through in time.p  pIf anyone could perhaps show me some light Id much appreciate it.p  pThank you  p

Negative 459 pI have a custom field component based on codeExt.form.field.Basecode. I got the big idea from this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6153362howtocreatecustomextjsformfieldcomponent1696411816964118posta. But whats bothering me with this solution is the fact, that it has a fixed height. What I would like to have instead is that the container grows in height as I add entries to the grid.p  pI have made an earlier attempt to make such a field but based on a Panel containing the grid and buttons. Putting this panel into a codevboxcode layout and adding rows to the grid perfectly resized the container form panel. What did I miss to implement that the container would resizep  pHere is a fiddle where you should easily see what I mean a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netamx9j relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netamx9jap

Negative 459 pIve seen Objective C code using a collection of practices, raging from passing a pointer of NSError for execution finish status  to using NSAssert  to implementing throw  to relaying on delegate for status code returned in the callback  to the old c method of returning a booleanint indicating with 1 being success and co.p  pI cant identify a consistent pattern for how should I be handling errors happening in my app running on client devices. For ex, what would you recommend handling for the following casesp  ul liClient attempt to access a network resource, network resource timed out  returned 500li liUnexpected state that should have not even happened reached in logical code sectionli liAttempt to write to disk failed Out of disk space, not permission and codeli ul  pComing from Java, server side practices exceptions the weapon of choice, using Objective C and C is seems that exceptions exist but are not encouraged.

Changing the section background to a red tint or a solid color did not change the phantom elements colortint.li ulli liIf I connect the Chrome debug tools for desktop, the very second that I hit Inspect, the phantom bars disappear, both on my Android device and in the emulated view of it.li liIf I flip my phone sideways to render the content wide, and then flip it back, the phantom bars disappear.li liI have removed all css table formatting to no avail. I have remove all combinations of css associated with that block of content to no avail. The only thing that makes it go away is removing a background from the sections entirely, or using an opaque background that presumably hides these phantom blocks.li liI have removed all my custom script at the bottom of the page to no avail.li liI have removed all manner of content surrounding this block of content to no avail.li liDifferent combinations of content make the bars render in different places. Sometimes, when switching back to the original configuration, the bars will render differently than they once did, even though all the code has returned to normal.li ul  pI dont know what to do anymore. I was hopping the Chrome debug would work out and that Id be able to identify what exactly is being rendered here but I cannot, as the phantom elements immediately disappear once I view the CSSHTML

Negative 459 pI am relatively new to programming and am making a website using bootstrap 3.0.p  pI want to make two rows that center in the middle of the page. For the first row I used codediv classcolmd4 colmdoffset2code and for the second row codediv classcolmd4code.p  pMy first question is if it is ok that this adds up to 10 rows instead of 12 or if I need to specify the 2 rows on the right also If so, how can this be donep  pAlso I would like to increase the horizontal spacing between the columns. I did a bit of research on that and came across mixins but its quit hard for me to grasp. If anybody here can provide me with a simple way to increase the horizontal spacing between two columns that would be great. p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 459 pI have to write a reference counted wrapper class in C11 for Win32 handles like HFONT, HWND, HMODULE and so on. I want to use a single WinHandle class that implicitly casts to all handle types which are all a void typedef. Unfortunately all handles have different functions to destroy the underlying object for example DestroyWindow, CloseHandle, DeleteObject and so forth, thus id need a different class for every handletype to implement the appropriate destroyfunction. that would be 47 classes  base class including user objects, gdi objects and kernel objectsp  pSo is there a way to determine at runtime of which type the handle is or rather which function needs to be called In the documentation I only found the isWindow function p  pI already thought about using RTTI or calling all deletefunctions until one of them succeeds. RTTI wont work because all HANDLE types are typedefs of void and thus the same. The latter might work, but all handles must be unique for it to work properly no GDI handle can ever have the same value as a user handle or kernel handle otherwise it might cause bugs and memory leaksp

Negative 459 pFor a new Wordpress website of mine Im running into a little problem. p  pThere is a custom post type named vehicle which uses the url slug vehicle. p  pThe thing is, my website isnt aimed at cars, but at boats, so I want to change the url to www.domain.comboatsboatname1 instead of www.domain.comvehicleboatname1. p  pI have succeeded in editing the slug using the following code  after which I flushed the rewrite urls and changed permalinks back and forthp  pcodefunction changevehiclerewriterules      global wpposttypes     rewrite  ampwpposttypes[vehicle]gtrewrite     rewrite[slug]  horses  addaction init, changevehiclerewriterules, 999  codep  pOn my homepage, there are nog links showing www.domain.comboatsboatname, but when I click on them, I get a 404. If I change the url to www.domain.comvehicleboatname it DOES work. So the urls have changed, but the working post is still shown under vehicle  instead of under boats.p  pIs there a way, perhaps using .htaccess, so that EVERY url on my website that shows vehicle  is changed to boats  p  pOr perhaps a way that when I click on a link www.domain.comboatsboatname that it SHOWS the vehicle content, but shows boats in the URL. p  pThanks in advance for your helpp  pMikep

Negative 459 pI have spent few days searching everywhere for a solution to this. This is for C with Visual Studio 2013 ya, I am a newbiep  ul litwo textboxes Last name and First Name and a listbox with 5 names Higgins M, Higgins J, King J, Tran A, Dempsey S. I set listbox property as sorted.li liif I select Higgins J in listbox, then the word Higgins should appear in Last Name textbox and J should appear in First Name textbox.li liif I type Higgins in Last Name textbox, Higgins J should be the selected item in listbox Higgins J will be selected before Higgins M. If I type M in the First Name textbox, the selected item should change from Higgins J to Higgins M.li ul  pbut....here are the problems that made me decide to create an account herep  ol lipIf I type Hi or Hig instead of Higgins, it has to stay that way, it does not become Higgins in the textbox. Only the indexhighlight in listbox is changed, not the entry in textbox whatever I type in the textbox stays. I suspect the events that I use are the reason I cannot get this done. Textboxtextchanged and listboxselectedindexchanged. So whatever I do in one event will automatically triggers the other. I have tried changing the events, but so far the result simply worse. Using if LastNametextbox.Text   did not help either.pli lipHow do I combine Last Name and First Name as one indexpli ol  pI apologise if this question has appeared or sounded ambiguous.

Negative 459 pIn my application, I am calculating atomic distances, which must be precise.  As far as I am aware, the only precise way to do this is by using the square root function.  However, using the square root function has created a bottleneck in my application.p  pThe data processed by the application will be reprocessed several times in the future, so caching the result of sqrt may increase performance after the first run, but only if the correct efficient collection type is used.

Is this the best solution, would a different collection be better, or should I implement a collection especially for the taskp

Further the server and the client browser are running local on the same system. My httpd.conf is shown here p  precode   This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the  configuration directives that give the server its instructions.  See ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4gt for detailed information.  In particular, see   ltURLhttphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4moddirectives.htmlgt  for a discussion of each configuration directive.   Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding  what they do.  Theyre here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure  consult the online docs. You have been warned.     Configuration and logfile names If the filenames you specify for many  of the servers control files begin with  or drive for Win32, the  server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do not begin  with , the value of ServerRoot is prepended  so logsaccesslog  with ServerRoot set to usrlocalapache2 will be interpreted by the  server as usrlocalapache2logsaccesslog, whereas logsaccesslog   will be interpreted as logsaccesslog.   NOTE Where filenames are specified, you must use forward slashes  instead of backslashes e.g., capache instead of capache.  If a drive letter is omitted, the drive on which httpd.exe is located  will be used by default.  It is recommended that you always supply  an explicit drive letter in absolute paths to avoid confusion.    ServerRoot The top of the directory tree under which the servers  configuration, error, and log files are kept.   Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point  ServerRoot at a nonlocal disk, be sure to specify a local disk on the  Mutex directive, if filebased mutexes are used.  If you wish to share the  same ServerRoot for multiple httpd daemons, you will need to change at  least PidFile.  ServerRoot Cxamppapache    Mutex Allows you to set the mutex mechanism and mutex file directory  for individual mutexes, or change the global defaults   Uncomment and change the directory if mutexes are filebased and the default  mutex file directory is not on a local disk or is not appropriate for some  other reason.   Mutex defaultlogs    Listen Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses andor  ports, instead of the default. See also the ltVirtualHostgt  directive.   Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to   prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.  Listen 12.34.56.7880 Listen 80    Dynamic Shared Object DSO Support   To be able to use the functionality of a module which was built as a DSO you  have to place corresponding LoadModule lines at this location so the  directives contained in it are actually available before they are used.

switch.     UserGroup The name or number of the usergroup to run httpd as.  It is usually good practice to create a dedicated user and group for  running httpd, as with most system services.  User daemon Group daemon  ltIfModulegt   Main server configuration   The directives in this section set up the values used by the main  server, which responds to any requests that arent handled by a  ltVirtualHostgt definition.  These values also provide defaults for  any ltVirtualHostgt containers you may define later in the file.   All of these directives may appear inside ltVirtualHostgt containers,  in which case these default settings will be overridden for the  virtual host being defined.     ServerAdmin Your address, where problems with the server should be  emailed.  This address appears on some servergenerated pages, such  as error documents.  e.g. adminyourdomain.com  ServerAdmin postmasterlocalhost    ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.  This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify  it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.   If your host doesnt have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.  ServerName localhost80    Deny access to the entirety of your servers filesystem. You must  explicitly permit access to web content directories in other   ltDirectorygt blocks below.  ltDirectory gt     AllowOverride none     Require all denied     Header set AccessControlAllowOrigin      Header set AccessControlAllowHeaders ContentType, Accept     Header set AccessControlAllowMethods GET, PUT, OPTIONS, DELETE, POST ltDirectorygt    Note that from this point forward you must specifically allow  particular features to be enabled  so if somethings not working as  you might expect, make sure that you have specifically enabled it  below.     DocumentRoot The directory out of which you will serve your  documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but  symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.  DocumentRoot Cxampphtdocs ltDirectory Cxampphtdocsgt           Possible values for the Options directive are None, All,      or any combination of        Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews           Note that MultiViews must be named explicitly  Options All      doesnt give it to you.           The Options directive is both complicated and important.  Please see      httphttpd.apache.orgdocs2.4modcore.htmloptions      for more information.          Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI            AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.      It can be All, None, or any combination of the keywords        AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig Limit          AllowOverride All            Controls who can get stuff from this server.          Require all granted     Header set AccessControlAllowOrigin      Header set AccessControlAllowHeaders ContentType, Accept     Header set AccessControlAllowMethods GET, PUT, OPTIONS, DELETE, POST ltDirectorygt    DirectoryIndex sets the file that Apache will serve if a directory  is requested.  ltIfModule dirmodulegt     DirectoryIndex index.php index.pl index.cgi index.asp index.shtml index.html index.htm                     default.php default.pl default.cgi default.asp default.shtml default.html default.htm                     home.php home.pl home.cgi home.asp home.shtml home.html home.htm ltIfModulegt    The following lines prevent .htaccess and .htpasswd files from being   viewed by Web clients.   ltFiles .htgt     Require all denied     Header set AccessControlAllowOrigin      Header set AccessControlAllowHeaders ContentType, Accept     Header set AccessControlAllowMethods GET, PUT, OPTIONS, DELETE, POST ltFilesgt    ErrorLog The location of the error log file.  If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a ltVirtualHostgt  container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be  logged here.  If you do define an error logfile for a ltVirtualHostgt  container, that hosts errors will be logged there and not here.  ErrorLog logserror.log    LogLevel Control the number of messages logged to the errorlog.  Possible values include debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,  alert, emerg.  LogLevel warn  ltIfModule logconfigmodulegt           The following directives define some format nicknames for use with      a CustomLog directive see below.          LogFormat h l u t r gts b Refereri UserAgenti combined     LogFormat h l u t r gts b common      ltIfModule logiomodulegt        You need to enable modlogio.c to use I and O       LogFormat h l u t r gts b Refereri UserAgenti I O combinedio     ltIfModulegt            The location and format of the access logfile Common Logfile Format.      If you do not define any access logfiles within a ltVirtualHostgt      container, they will be logged here.  Contrariwise, if you do      define perltVirtualHostgt access logfiles, transactions will be      logged therein and not in this file.          CustomLog logsaccess.log common            If you prefer a logfile with access, agent, and referer information      Combined Logfile Format you can use the following directive.          CustomLog logsaccess.log combined ltIfModulegt  ltIfModule aliasmodulegt           Redirect Allows you to tell clients about documents that used to       exist in your servers namespace, but do not anymore. The client       will make a new request for the document at its new location.      Example      Redirect permanent foo httpwww.example.combar            Alias Maps web paths into filesystem paths and is used to      access content that does not live under the DocumentRoot.      Example      Alias webpath fullfilesystempath           If you include a trailing  on webpath then the server will      require it to be present in the URL.  You will also likely      need to provide a ltDirectorygt section to allow access to      the filesystem path.            ScriptAlias This controls which directories contain server scripts.       ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that      documents in the target directory are treated as applications and      run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to the      client.  The same rules about trailing  apply to ScriptAlias      directives as to Alias.          ScriptAlias cgibin Cxamppcgibin  ltIfModulegt  ltIfModule cgidmodulegt           ScriptSock On threaded servers, designate the path to the UNIX      socket used to communicate with the CGI daemon of modcgid.          Scriptsock cgisock ltIfModulegt    Cxamppcgibin should be changed to whatever your ScriptAliased  CGI directory exists, if you have that configured.  ltDirectory Cxamppcgibingt     AllowOverride All     Options None     Require all granted     Header set AccessControlAllowOrigin      Header set AccessControlAllowHeaders ContentType, Accept     Header set AccessControlAllowMethods GET, PUT, OPTIONS, DELETE, POST ltDirectorygt  ltIfModule mimemodulegt           TypesConfig points to the file containing the list of mappings from      filename extension to MIMEtype.          TypesConfig confmime.types            AddType allows you to add to or override the MIME configuration      file specified in TypesConfig for specific file types.          AddType applicationxgzip .tgz           AddEncoding allows you to have certain browsers uncompress      information on the fly. Note Not all browsers support this.          AddEncoding xcompress .Z     AddEncoding xgzip .gz .tgz           If the AddEncoding directives above are commentedout, then you      probably should define those extensions to indicate media types          AddType applicationxcompress .Z     AddType applicationxgzip .gz .tgz            AddHandler allows you to map certain file extensions to handlers      actions unrelated to filetype. These can be either built into the server      or added with the Action directive see below           To use CGI scripts outside of ScriptAliased directories      You will also need to add ExecCGI to the Options directive.          AddHandler cgiscript .cgi .pl .asp       For type maps negotiated resources     AddHandler typemap var            Filters allow you to process content before it is sent to the client.           To parse .shtml files for serverside includes SSI      You will also need to add Includes to the Options directive.          AddType texthtml .shtml     AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml ltIfModulegt    The modmimemagic module allows the server to use various hints from the  contents of the file itself to determine its type.

Here I tried to write the DataVectorArr to disk, which obviously fails because the size isnt correct. I am not also sure if the DataVectorArr contains the DataVector now.  if DataVectorArr  NULL delete DataVectorArr codepre  pEnough code. Is is it even possible, or am I doing it wrong If I am doing it wrong, what would be the solution p  pRegards, Okkaajp  pEdit If its unclear what I am trying to do, read the following which I commented earlierp  pYes, I am trying to cast the vector of pairs to a codePCHARcode or codePBYTEcode  so I can store it to disk using WriteFile. After it is stored, I can read it from disk as byte array, and parse back to vector of pairs. Is this possible I got the idea from converting  casting codestructcode to a byte array and backread more from here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13775893convertingstructtobyteandbacktostructConverting struct to byte and back to structa but I am not sure if this is possible with stdvector instead of structures.p

The previous build system has just been a suite of rather hacky Ant scripts that have built up over the years, which Im attempting to replace with Maven and a proper CI Jenkins.p  pThe issue I have at the moment is that there is an Ant task called buildlive that replaces the strings 8080 and 4343 dev values with 80 and 443 live values respectively, in the strutsconfig.xml files of a couple of the webapps.

Negative 459 pI have a computation that has the structure of a binary tree, where at each node a bunch of highly vectorized functions take the output of the previous branches to produce new branches nodes on the same level are independent. Since the functions are vectorized, they run well both on CPU or GPU, the latter naturally giving substantially faster execution. p  pI will soon have access to 4GPU 2CPU workstation to run my code on and I would like to use it as optimally as I can. I understand how to use codeparforcode on the GPUs only or on the CPUs cores only, but I would like to reasonably distribute the workload between the GPUs and the CPU, since GPU execution only leaves so many CPU cores at idle, and even though they are much slower than the GPUs, they are still fast enough to have noticeable impact on the total execution time.p  pstrongQ1strong Since the functions in each node are vectorized, is it actually reasonable to run independent nodes in 1nodepercore mode Or does that strictly depend on the particular case Is there a rule of the thumb for such dilemmas p  pstrongQ2strong Assuming in strongQ1strong that simultaneous execution of 1 node per core is suboptimal, is there a way to assign several CPU cores to one workerp  pstrongQ3strong Is there a way to distribute the codeparforcode workers between GPUs and CPUs in an emefficientem wayp  pHere is what I dont consider particularly emefficientem in strongQ3strong depending on the loop index, the loop instance can execute the GPU code on a given codegpuDevicecode or on CPU core. Knowing the performance difference between GPU and CPU execution, one can deduce a suitable proportion of the indices assigned to CPU execution. The problem with this is that codeparforcode does not pick the loop indices in any particular order, which in turn can easily lead to instances where it tries to execute two independent tasks on same GPU, which is inefficient since it will have to serialize the tasks.p  pThanksp

Negative 459 pI am working with big data and i have matrices with size like 2000x100000, so in order to to work faster i tried using the numpy.memmap to avoid storing in memory this large matrices due to the RAM limitations. The problem is that when i store the same matrix in 2 variables, i.e One with numpy.load and in the other with np.memmap, the contents are not the same. Is this normal I am using the same data type in memmap as in my data. Examplep  precodeA1  numpy.loadmydata.npy A2  numpy.memmapmydata.npy,dtypenumpy.float64, moder, shape2000,2000 A1[0,0]  0 A2[0,0]  1.8758506894003703e309 codepre  pThats the contents of the first element of the array in both cases. The correct one is the value 0 but i am getting this weird number by using the memmap.  Thank you.p
Negative 459 pIm fairly new to token based authorization. Im trying to find the flaws in a custom expirationtokenrefresh scheme.p  pI have a basic JWT auth setup in an Express API Im setting the JWT expiration to 1 hr However, JWT checks token expiration relative to the time the token was issued.  I would prefer that the expiration time gets reset after each successful api call. If my user is actively using the app for more than an hour, I dont want them to have to log back in to refresh the token and possibly lose whatever data they are working on.p  pOn the the other hand, I do want the token to expire if they are not responsive for more than an hour.p  pI have come up with the following approachp  blockquote   pDuring every successful API request, issue a new JWT and send it in a   custom response header.  My client side code is responsible for   checking this JWT response header and using its value as the new default Authorization request header.  Thus, if there is no API    request from the user for more than 1 hour, the token will expire and   not be refreshed. Login would then be required. In addition, the original issuedate of the token timestamp of loginauthentication will be stored so that a hardexpiration of the token will be enforced after 24 hours.p blockquote  pThis seems fairly straightforward and reasonably secure, but I havent seen any reference to it in my JWT research.  Is there a better way to achieve the same goal  Am I missing a major security hole with this approachp  pstrongUPDATEstrong After thinking of this for some time, I realized that the problem with this is that it opens the door to replay attacks that could not be thwarted by token expiration. So there should absolutely be a hardexpiration check hard expiration would invalidate the token at some time after issue date, regardless of recent user activity.p

Negative 459 pI have been experimenting with log4j2.xml for some time and have been really impressed with the performance. However, I am stuck with an issue in which I need help. I am using rolling file appender to roll out log files everyday. I will share my log4j2.xml in a moment.

But if I dont send any requests to the Logging Application for the next 2 days, for example December 24 and December 25 and then send the request on December 27.

Negative 459 pI am trying to make a JavaFX application running in the background to show up set visible by a specific keystroke and to make the window the active window immediately. Therefore I set the primary stage alwaysOnTopproperty codetruecode, call codestage.toFrontcode and finally call codestage.requestFocuscode. Afterwards I request focus for a text field. When the window is made visible I would like to instantly start typing into the text field. p  pHowever, when I for example have a Ubuntuterminal selected and make the window visible and start typing, the application is shown on top of everything, however, the typing goes to the terminal. The application window is not active Nevertheless, the focused property of the stage is codetruecode. Is that a bug or am I missing something Is it OS relatedp  hr  pemEditem I am willed to give my little hackaround for this problem that I am using at the moment, because the internet is suggesting, that a lot of people are facing this problem Since I am working on a linux maschine I have access to the wonderful tool codewmctrlcode. It is part of most standard repositories. codewmctrl a WINDOWNAMEcode sets the window with the name codeWINDOWNAMEcode active. For now, I simply call this tool from my source code when I need the window to be active. Since this is more of a dirty hack than any thing else, I sure want to get rid of it.p
Negative 459 pI recently put several old, yucky git directory structures into one new, clean structure in SVN, then pulled the entire SVN repository back out into a new, clean, local git repository. One IntelliJ project was so messed up I had to import the old IntelliJ project, which created a new code.imlcode file having a better name, and deleted the old code.imlcode file. I reconfigured everything, committed back into SVN, and verified other people could open the project and build.p  pToday I tried to edit a file for the first time in this project and got the message, These files do not belong to the project. IntelliJ offers to unlock the file or all nonproject files in the current session, but both options sound wrong. What have I done to myself, and how do I fix itp

Negative 459 pI am writing stored procedure unit tests in VS2012 on 2008R2 for a database that keeps a large number of stored procedures, tables and foreign keys.p  pFor each stored procedure test I generate few lines of data in related tables before performing the test.  p  pI have recognized that this practice will make the tests very sensitive to database changes especially to the additions of not null columns or extra keys. p  pThe cascading impact of such changes may result in having to keep a lot of tests in sync. Some tests may even have nothing to do with the particular change but share one or more related tables therefore will fail on preparation.p  pAlso, a rather inconvenient consequence of this is that it is hard to make disctinction between tests failed on testing conditions and those failed on key violation during preparation. p  pThinking on a large scale the working hour consequences may be serious. p  pAnything I found so far on this topic has been way too general. p  pNow comes the question does a relevant best practice exist for the question of test data in dev db vs. generating test data within testp

Negative 459 pI am still quite inexperienced with using Java, and would like to solve this stumbling blockp  pI have created two classes to be used in a rigid body dynamics simulation, calledp  pcodeRigidBodycode codeRigidBodyElementcodep  pThe plan is to create a codeRigidBodycode object. This object will be comprised of many little codeRigidBodyElementcode objects. So, inside codeRigidBodycode, there will be a single array of type codeRigidBodyElementscode to contain all of the rigid body elements.p  pAs for codeRigidBodyElementcode, there will be a field variable containing the coordinates of the element relative to a fixed point on the codeRigidBodycode object. This variable will be called coderelativeCoordinatescode.p  pThat much is fine. The problem arises when we want to find the absolute coordinates of each element, codeabsoluteCoordinatescode. To find that, we would need to add the rotated coderelativeCoordinatescode of codeRigidBodyElementcode to the coordinates of the overall rigid body, codeRigidBodycode. i.e. writing a function in codeRigidBodyElementcode, such that when an instance of codeRigidBodyElementscode calls this function, it will get some of the information from the instance of the class codeRigidBodycode in which this element is instantiated.p  pI currently have no idea how to define a function for an object to refer to another object that has instantiated the first object.p

Negative 459 pI would like to use the EZAudio framework to do realtime microphone signal FFT processing, along with some other processing in order to determine the peak frequency. p  pThe problem is, the EZmicrophone class only appears to work on 512 samples, however, my signal requires an FFT of 8192 or even 16384 samples. There doesnt appear to be a way to change the buffer size in EZMicrophone, but Ive read posts that recommend creating an array of my target size and appending the microphone buffer to it, then when its full, do the FFT. p  pWhen I do this though, I get large chunks of memory with no data, or discontinuities between the segments of copied memory. I think it may have something to do with the timing or order in which the microphone delegate is being called or memory being overwritten in different threads...Im grasping at straws here.

Negative 459 pIm creating a custom web analytics for my application, with very specific inputs of user data. Basically, Im writing all the user interaction on the website page visited, banner click, button click, etc, so this will generate tons of data and inserts per second. This software will be connected to a signalr hub and the administrator will see some realtime statistics.p  pOur first choice was use RavenDb better .NET integration and the triggers can easy connect the events to signalR, but my needs for realtime user data queries made me search a little more for elasticsearch because I already use it on other software parts.p  pEvery user page interaction will query the user previous data, returning some statistics that will be used for site personalization custom banner, etc.p  pSo, the main question is what database is better for this A lot of inserts, a lot of queries on recent data and advanced queries for statistics.

This is thrown during creating new SimConnect objectbr codevar simconnect  new SimConnect...code br OFC, to use SimConnect, firstly Microsoft Flight Simulator should be launched and its started.

And nothing. br 4 I ran FSX as Administrator  also nothing p  pI found the workaround I moved the library project to the another project  console application where I used HttpSelfHostConfiguration to host that. And later, I call this api from the main project MVC. For this solution everything works fine I tested for Local IIS [debugging] and also for IIS Manager. I have to only run the Host Api project as Administrator.p  pIm very curious what is the reason of the exception.

Negative 459 pI am working on a responsive design that includes iFrames to load Wordpress blogs. The page loads flawlessly on all browsers but native iOS Safari, but they do not load at all in Safari. Coworkers with iPhones suggest they load but dont scroll, which I understand is a simple meta change, but my testbed device an iPod touch wont load them even after a firmware update to iOS6 and I therefore have to design as though iFrames do not load at all. Among the best alternative suggestions I read was to load content into a div.p  pThe content loads into a div nicely. The challenge now is that the divs wont resize, and resizing dynamically is a requirement of the page the page has a jQuery slideUp header, and content adjusts as it slides. So the iFrame resizes but does not load in iOS, and the div loads but wont resize in any browser.

Negative 459 pI was wondering if someone could help me with a problem Im having integrating Onedrive with MS Word.p  pIm working on a C MVC web application that uploads a document from our system to onedrive using the Live SDK, then uses the MS Word URI scheme to open the document in word for mac or pc.p  pE.g.     ms                        wordofeua hrefhttpsd.docs.live.neta2127392r369g83aFOLDERNAMEFILENAME relnofollowhttpsd.docs.live.neta2127392r369g83aFOLDERNAMEFILENAMEap  pMS Word URI schema a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryofficedn906146.aspx relnofollowhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryofficedn906146.aspxap  pUnder normal conditions this works fine, and allows the document to be opened in word. The user can edit the doc, click save, and it will be saved to the users Onedrive path given in the URI assuming the user has signed into the same MS Live account in Word, that is connected to our application.p  pHowever there are occasions where someone might not log in to the same account that is registered with our application, or are sometimes not prompted to enter a password, and so they sit there forever wondering why they cant open the document this has happened occasionally when a user has saved a password from a different Live account onto their mac keychain.p  pWe have tried using edit links or preauthenticated urls to get around this. Unfortunately there are problems with saving the document to the original location, regardless of the method used. For example, obtaining a sharededitlink will allow you to open the document in word online, which can allow you to sign in to a different account and save to the original location online or via MS word. However opening in word online often defeats the purpose, as in most circumstances the account linked to our application will be logged into automatically unless the user clears cookies or uses incognito, so clicking Open in Word will still require the user to log into the original account.p  pTo sum up the problem, we basically need a way to open a document in edit mode directly in Microsoft Word, that will also allow us to save the document to the original Onedrive location.p  pHas anyone ever been able to accomplish this, or knows of a better way p

But just saying that I have to use a dictionnary doesnt answer all of my question. I had thought of using a dictionnary but my main issue is creating the name either the name of the list, either the key of a dictionnary. I have to create this in a loop, not knowing how many I have to create. Thus, the name of the list or key should have a variable which must be the number of the road. And its here that I have a problem.p  pAs I said before, in my loop i tried to use a variable from the iteration loop to name my list but this didnt work, since its not possible to concanate list with string. I could create an empty dictionnary with many empty keyvalue pairs, but I would still have to go through the keys name in the loop to add the values from the csv file in the dict.p

We are developing a new component that will talk to the existing system and will have its own data store of some kind for holding XML for later processing.

Negative 459 pLets say I have a SKSpriteNode that represents a car wheel, with a circular SKPhysicsBody successfully attached to it. The genre would be sideways scrolling 2d car driving gamesimulator, obviously.p  pWhat I want is to calculate all the inmotor physics myself without resorting to the SpriteKit physics engine quite yet. Id like to keep full control on how the mechanics of the motor, clutch, transmission etc. are calculated, all the way to the RPM of the drive wheel.p  pFrom that point onwards, though, Id happily give control to the SpriteKit physics engine, that would then calculate what happens, when the revolving drive wheel touces the surface of the road. The car advances, slows down, accelerates andor the wheels slip, whatever the case might be.p  pCalculating the mechanics to get the wheel RPM is no problem. Im just not sure on how to go on from there.p  pIm able to rotate the wheel simply by applying zRotation in the update method, like thisp  precodeself.rearWheelInstance.zRotation  self.theCar.wheelRPS6.283  timeSinceLastUpdate  revolutions  2pi  radians codepre  pThis way Im able to apply the exact RPM Ive calculated earlier. The obvious downside is, SpriteKits physics engine is totally oblivious about this rotation. For all that it knows, the wheel teleports from one phase to the next, so it doesnt create friction with the road surface or any other interaction with other SpriteKit physicsBodies, for that matter.p  pOn the other hand, I can apply torque to the wheelp  precode[self.rearWheelInstance.physicsBody applyTorque someTorque] codepre  por angular impulsep  precode[self.rearWheelInstance.physicsBody applyAngularImpulse someAngularImpulse] codepre  pThis does revolve the wheel in a fashion that SpriteKit physics engine understands, thus making it interact with its surroundings correctly. p  pBut unless Im missing something obvious, this considers the wheel as a free rolling object independent of crankshaft, transmission or drive axel RPM. In reality, though, the wheel doesnt have the choice to roll at any other RPM than what is transmitted through the drivetrain to the axel unless the transmission is on neutral, the clutch pedal is down or the clutch is slipping, but those are whole another stories. p  pSo 1 Am I able to somehow manipulate zRotation in a way that the SpriteKit physics engine understands as revolving movementp  porp  p2 Do I have a clear flaw in my logic that indicates that this isnt what Im supposed to be trying in the first place If so, could you be so kind as to point me to the flaws so that I could adopt a better practice insteadp

Negative 459 pI wonder if anyone can point me in the right direction. Im doing an interval timer app for Android phones to use while interval training. At certain intervals I want to mute other applications like the media player since I listen to music while training, play a custom sound not any of the default notification sounds and then unmute the other applications again. I would prefer if this muteunmute was gradually so it wont be a drastic cut in music. Ive been reading a bit and I cant decide if the best way to do this is through the Ringtonemanager, Notificationmanager or simply play it through the media player I never done anything with sounds before so any help is much appreciated.

Negative 459 pIm doing video capture from a webcam in two separate ways think two applications using Direct Show and Media Foundation.p  pUsing Direct Show, my Logitech c920 webcam has 3 output pinsp  ol liVideo capture i.e. codePINCATEGORYCAPTUREcode or codePINCATEGORYPREVIEWcode in I420, RGB24 and MJPG pixel formats, with FPS from 2 to 30, depending on media type.li liStill image capture i.e. codePINCATEGORYSTILLcode in I420 and RGB24 with just 1 FPS.li liVideo capture i.e. codePINCATEGORYCAPTUREcode or codePINCATEGORYPREVIEWcode in h264 with FPS from 5 to 30.li ol  pSo, since Im concerned only with video capture, I ignore all pins that are not  codePINCATEGORYCAPTUREcode or codePINCATEGORYPREVIEWcode, which works great.p  pUsing Media Foundation, the same camera has 3 stream descriptors codeIMFPresentationDescriptorGetStreamDescriptorCountcode. Each stream descriptor provides codeIMFMediaTypeHandlercode that allows you to iterate over media types. So I have 3 IMFMediaTypeHandlersp  ol liVideo capture i.e. codeIMFMediaTypeHandlerGetMajorType  MFMediaTypeVideocode in I420, RGB24 and MJPG pixel formats, with FPS from 2 to 30, depending on media type.li liVideo capture i.e. codeIMFMediaTypeHandlerGetMajorType  MFMediaTypeVideocode in i420 and RGB24 with just 1 FPS.li liVideo capture i.e. codeIMFMediaTypeHandlerGetMajorType  MFMediaTypeVideocode in h264 with FPS from 5 to 30.li ol  pYou can notice that Media Foundations stream descriptors seem to map to Direct Shows output pins 1 on 1. Except that Media Foundation didnt mark the stream descriptor 2 as still image capture codeMFMediaTypeImagecode, in contrast to what Direct Show is doing.p  pStill image capture requires different handling than video capture, so my Direct Show code errors and doesnt do any capturing at all when trying to use media types from pin 2. Well, I only care about video capturing in the first place, so that is fine.p  pBut even through Media Foundation tells that the stream descriptor 2 is video capture, my Media Foundation code, which works perfectly with all media types from steam descriptors 1 and 3, crashes on media types from stream descriptor 2, similarly to how Direct Show crashes on still image capture only.p  pSo I get the impression that its either Media Foundation or a hrefhttpsupport.logitech.comproducthdprowebcamc920download relnofollowthe Windows 7 webcam driver provided by Logitecha is buggy and not marking stream descriptor 2 as still image capture when it should, or Im checking the wrong flag to determine if its video capture or still image capture.
