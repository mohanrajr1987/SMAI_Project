Positive 2438 pI know there have been several topics about this, but Im having difficulties with inserting and updating many to many relationships with Entity Framework 6, wrapped with a repository layer around it.p  pRemoving and adding records from a navigation property being a collection doesnt result in any changes to the database as monitored in the database log interceptorp  precodeResource newResource  resourceForAppointment.FirstOrDefaultx gt x.ResourceId  schedulerEvent.ResourceId existingAppointment.Resources.AddnewResource  Resource oldResource  resourceForAppointment.FirstOrDefaultx gt x.ResourceId  schedulerEvent.PreviousResourceId existingAppointment.Resources.RemoveoldResource  await this.Repository.UpdateAsyncexistingAppointment codepre  pReading the data works perfectly, so I doubt it has something to do with the configuration, p  precode[TableAppointment] public partial class Appointment      public Appointment                      Resources  new HashSetltResourcegt          ...      public virtual ICollectionltResourcegt Resources  get set   codepre  pHeres what I have got in the repositorys async methodp  precode public virtual async TaskltTEntitygt UpdateAsyncTEntity entity         this.Context.SetltTEntitygt.Attachentity       this.Context.Entryentity.State  EntityState.Modified       await this.SaveChangesAsync        return entity           codepre  pUpdating simple properties and 1 to 1 navigation properties is not a problem, its just the 1 to many or many to many relationships that fail.p  pFor the moment as a workaround, Im using the following code and I absolutely need to get rid of this piece of bad codingp  precode   await this.ResourcesRepository.ExecuteSqlAsyncDELETE FROM AppointmentResource WHERE AppointmentId  existingAppointment.AppointmentID AND ResourceID  schedulerEvent.PreviousResourceId    await this.ResourcesRepository.ExecuteSqlAsyncINSERT INTO AppointmentResource VALUESexistingAppointment.AppointmentID,schedulerEvent.ResourceId  codepre  pOther noteworthy remarks here include that I use Unity MVC as the bootstrapper for my repository, hereby using the PerRequestLifeTimeManager. This DbContext is then injected into a unit of work class which creates the repository with predefined DbContext.

Positive 2438 pI have a table of transactions. For any given record, I want to be able to include a portal which shows all related transactions. Since the related records are in the same table as the parent record, I have created a second table occurrence TO. I have linked these two TOs with a join table, into which I enter the foreign keys of the two TOs to indicate which records relate to which other records.p  pOn the layout for a given transaction, Ive added a portal which displays related records from the second table occurrence. So far, so good.p  pSo, lets say in the join table I said transaction 100 is linked to transactions 105 and 110.

It works fairly well but it is very slow usingp  precodeWHERE tags LIKE [16] codepre  pI tried using full text search using p  precodeSELECT  FROM datablocks WHERE MATCHtags AGAINST[16] codepre  pBut this returned 0 results. I already decreased the ftminwordlen to 3 so that event a one digit id will search but it still returns 0.p  pIf I need to do this a completely different way please tell me, otherwise, why is the full text search not returning any rowsp  pThanksp

Positive 2438 pUsing PostgreSQL, I have a table that should have a many to many relationship to itself.

Negative 2438 pI am working on a project that is using a JTable to display, among other things, a column of dates. We needed validation for the user input for dates, so I have implemented a combination of masking for format validation and parsing for actual date validation. I have done this using a custom CellEditor for the date column.p  pInside my MaskedCellEditor, I have a JFormattedTextField. I setup the masking for dates. Then I add an InputVerifier to allow for actual validation. My InputVerifier implements verify to check 1. textField.isEditValid 2. DateValidator.ValidDate. If either is invalid, verify returns false and the InputVerifier locks the focus into the text field the cell editor and a small message dialog is displayed reminding the user of the date format.p  pThe error message is a small, undecorated, nonmodal, nonfocusable JDialog that pops up underneath the cell being edited. It disappears on a keypress or a successful date verification. It is working great except for a small edge case.p  pIf the user selects a menu button on the top of the application while an invalid edit has popped up the dialog, it switches screens, destroying everything currently on the screen including the table. However, since the dialog is being shown and a keypresssuccessful edit has not occurred, the dialog is never hidden. It remains visible in a completely unrelated context on a different screen. Once the user has switched off the screen with the table, there is no way for the user to get rid of the dialog.p  pI have debated throwing either a Timer andor a MouseListener on the dialog itself that would cause it to disappear, but I feel that I am ignoring the actual problem. The dialog is never being disposed of and I am pretty sure its because it is still set to be visible and it is preventing the garbage collector from getting rid of it.p  pI have a Cleanup method on the panel holding the JTable, but I cannot find a good way to reference the dialog a component of the InputVerifier in order to get rid of it. The dialog is pretty far removed from the tables parent panel. Panel  JTable  CellEditor  JFormattedTextField  InputVerifier  JDialogp  pAny ideas on how to force the dialog to be hidden when the table is destroyed If you need more details, let me know. Im trying not to get you guys bogged down in the details, but there is a lot going on.p

Negative 2438 pHey guys, Ive just had a nagging question for a while regarding iPhone app user interfaces. For example, consider a hrefhttptapbots.comsoftwareweightbotgallery relnofollowWeightBotas User Interface. I am wondering, how are most of these user interfaces created In general, of course.p  pIs there a way to simply design controls that is, the images in a program like Photoshop, then use that skin for controls in UIKit I realize that there are some controls that are probably created by the programmer custom controls, but Im referring to the readymade ones that come in UIKit.p  pIn other words, is the concept similar to splicing web site designs Where a designer draws out the design of the website in something like Photoshop, and then it is cut up into pieces which can be applied to form the actual website I know this can be done for codeUIButtoncodes, can this also be done for other controls, and is this how it is usually donep  pOr perhaps this is done with Core Animation Ive heard this from time to time, so does this mean that the User Interfaces are hardcoded Or is Core Animation only used for the effects, such as applying the glowing effect to the numbers in WeightBotp  pIf there are any resources you can point me to I would really appreciate it.p  pThanksp
Negative 2438 pWere currently evaluating VS2010 and have upgraded our VS2008 CCLI project to the new .vcxproj format.  Ive noticed that a certain property we had set in the project settings did not get translated properly.  Under Configuration Properties  Managed Resources  Resource Logical Name, we used to have in VS2008 the settingp  precodeIntDirRootNamespace.InputName.resources codepre  pwhich indicated that all .resx files were to compile intop  precodeOurLib.SomeForm.resources codepre  pinside of the assembly. the Debug portion is dropped when assembledp  pAccording to MSDN, the InputName macro no longer exists and should be replaced with Filename.  However, when translating the above line to swap those macros, it does not seem to ever expand.  The second .resx file it tries to compile, I get a LINK  fatal error LNK1316 duplicate managed resource name DebugOurLib.Filename.resources.  This indicates to me that the  style macros are not being expanded here, at least in this specific property.p  pIf we dont set anything in that property, the default behavior seems to be to add the subdirectory as a prefix, such asp  precodeOurLib.Forms.SomeForm.resources codepre  pwhere Forms is the subdir of our project that the .resx file lives.  This only occurs when the .resx file is in an immediate subdirectory of the project being built.  If a .resx file exists somewhere else on disk aka ..OtherLibFormsSomeForm2.resx this prefix is NOT added.p  pThis is causing an issue with loading form resources, as it does not account for this possible prefix, even though we are using the standard Forms Designer method of getting at resourcesp  precodeSystemComponentModelComponentResourceManager  resources  gcnew SystemComponentModelComponentResourceManagerSomeFormtypeid codepre  pand do not specify the .resources file by name.p  pThe issue Ive just described may not be the same as the original question, but if I were to fix the Resource Logical Name issue I think this would all go away.  Does anyone have any information about these  macros and where they are allowed to be usedp

Negative 2438 pWhile Ive been familiar with HTTPS and the concept of SSL, I have recently begun some development and found I am a little confused.p  pThe requirement was that I write a small Java application that runs on a machine attached to a scanner. When a document is scanned this is picked up and the file usually PDF sent over the internet to our application server that will then process it. Ive written the application using Apache Commons libraries and HTTPClient. p  pThe second requirement was to connect over SSL, requiring a certificate. Following guidance on the HTTPclient page I am using AuthSSLProtocolSocketFactory from the contributions page.p  pThe constructor can take a keystore, keystore password, truststore and truststore password. As an initial test our DBA enabled SSL on one of our development webservers and provided me with a .p12 file which when I imported into IE allows me to connect successfully.p  pI am a bit confused between keystores and truststores and what steps I need to take using the keytool. I tried importing the p12 into a keystore file but get the errorp  precodekeytool error java.lang.Exception Input not an X.509 certificate codepre  pI followed a suggestion of importing the p12 into Internet Explorer and exporting as a .cer which I can then successfully import into a keystore. When I supply this as a keystore argument of the AuthSSLProtocolSocketFactory I get a meaningless errror, but if I try it as a truststore it seems like it reads it fine but ultimately I getp  precodeCaused by javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException Received fatal alert badcertificate codepre  pI am unsure if I have missed some steps, I am misunderstanding SSL and mutual authentication altogether or this is misconfiguration on the server side.p  pCan anyone provide suggestions or point me towards resources that might help me figure this out pleasep

I would need top  precodeSELECT A,B from Table codepre  pif there were no suffixes. With the suffix, however, I need to select the maximum value of A for each B.  That was phrased poorly.  I would expect the following results for the table abovep  precodeA      B  01C    1 02     1 03     2 03B    1 codepre  pRight now, I am using a subselect and my query isp  precodeSELECT A,B FROM Table t1 WHERE t1.A  SELECT MAXt2.A FROM Table t2WHERE LEFTt1.A,2  LEFTt2.A,2 codepre  pThis is incredibly inefficient, however, and my table is pretty large, so they query is taking far too long to run.

Negative 2438 pWere looking to build in a filter to our Magento site with drop down choices for the first two options, a selection box for price plus a colour chooser. p  pFirstly how easy is it to fetch the info for the first two dropdowns from the database so the first box is populated with the first category then the second box populated with the choices for that particular category and then change if someone changes the first selectionp  pSecondly how easy is it to set up a separate filter for each site so it only fetches info for the corresponding store and doesnt show products from other storesp  pThe filter will only have to show the products when you press a find button so I guess its a case of building up the search queryp  pThoughts and ideas on this would be great, only been working with Magento for a month so still not sure of its full capabilities.p  pThanksp

The script  C program that are addons of blender that im writing should be crossplatform because it will be redistributedill give the source and compiled programs. Maybe this note can help the program is actually wrote in C, and from python i can know the address in memory of the struct that contains the vertices data. If only i know how to do this, should be better to pass to the C program only an address, and from there find all the other verticesare stored in list.

Negative 2438 pIm having a performance issue that I dont understand. The system Im working on has two threads that look something like thisp  pVersion Ap  ul liThread 1 Data Processing  Data Selection  Data Formatting  FIFOli liThread 2 FIFO  Socketli ul  pWhere Selection thins down the data and the FIFO at the end of thread 1 is the FIFO at the beginning of thread 2 the FIFOs are actually TBB Concurrent Queues. For performance reasons, Ive altered the threads to look like thisp  pVersion Bp  ul liThread 1 Data Processing  Data Selection  FIFOli liThread 2 FIFO  Data Formatting  Socketli ul  pInitially, this optimization proved to be successful. Thread 1 is capable of much higher throughput. I didnt look too hard at Thread 2s performance because I expected the CPU usage would be higher and due to data thinning it wasnt a major concern. However, one of my colleagues asked for a performance comparison of version A and version B. To test the setup I had thread 2s socket a boost asio tcp socket write to an instance of iperf on the same box 127.0.0.1 with the goal of showing the maximum throughput.p  pTo compare the two set ups I first tried forcing the system to write data out of the socket at 500 Mbps. As part of the performance testing I monitored top. What I saw surprised me. Version A did not show up on top H nor did iperf this was actually as suspected. However, version B my enhanced version was showing up on top H with 10 cpu utilization and oddly iperf was showing up with 8.p  pObviously, that implied to me that I was doing something wrong. I cant seem to prove that I am though Things Ive confirmedp  ul liBoth versions are giving the socket 32k chunks of datali liBoth versions are using the same boost library 1.45li liBoth have the same optimization setting O3li liBoth receive the exact same data, write out the same data, and write it at the same rate.li liBoth use the same blocking write call.li liIm testing from the same box with the exact same setup Red Hatli liThe formatting part of thread 2 is emnotem the issue I removed it and reproduced the problemli liSmall packets across the network is emnotem the issue Im using TCPCORK and Ive confirmed via wireshark that the TCP Segments are all 16k.li liPutting a 1 ms sleep right after the socket write makes the CPU usage on both the socket thread and iperf go back to 0.li liPoor mans profiler reveals very little the socket thread is almost always sleeping.li liCallgrind reveals very little the socket write barely even registersli liSwitching iperf for netcat writing to devnull doesnt change anything actually netcats cpu usage was 20.li ul  pThe only thing I can think of is that Ive introduced a tighter loop around the socket write. However, at 500 Mbps I wouldnt expect that the cpu usage on both my process emandem iperf would be increasedp  pIm at a loss to why this is happening. My coworkers and I are basically out of ideas. Any thoughts or suggestions Ill happily try anything at this point.p

Negative 2438 pI am trying to use the WaveForm Audio functions in C to read from a microphone.

If necessary I can post up my pinvokes for the wave functions, but for the most part they are from pinvoke.net.p  pCan anyone spot anything wrong with the above code that would explain why I am not getting any data Any input is much appreciated.

Negative 2438 pIm porting a game from WP7 XNA to Android everything was working using Canvas but it was too slow so Ive switched to OpenGL ES, following the examples of Replica Island and SpriteMethodTest.p  pMy problem is that my textures arent being coloured or made transparent when I set glColor immediately before drawing the texture  it is completely ignored and the texture is drawn in the state it was loaded. All the colour and transparency information inherent in the texture itself is applied correctly. Im also generating some bitmaps programatically using setPixels and I have exactly the same issue there.p  pIm still at the OpenGL is just magic spells stage of understanding   which makes following the existing documentation, which seems to be aimed at mid or highlevel coders, rather frustrating. Id hoped that copypasting from those samples would work, but I must have missed something and I cant work out what it is. Ive got to the point where Im codeblind and cant tell the difference between their code and mine.p  pglColor4 clearly works in Replica Island, when I run that in the same emulator all the text fades in and out when the opacity changes, just as it should.

Negative 2438 pI am building an app with a reusable numeric keyboard. The keyboard has been placed in its own XML file so it can be included where needed throughout the app. I want to split the screen for the current activity into two pieces, the fixed size numeric keyboard at the bottom and a RelativeLayout RL above with the rest of the controls. p  pThe problem is, the RL isnt behaving itself. In the example below, the RL takes up the entire screen, and the keyboard does not show. The really strange thing is when I reverse the placement, place the include with the keyboard at the top, the screen displays as expected, with keyboard and RL each taking up roughly half. p  pIn other words when the keyboard is included at the top, all is fine but the keyboard is in the wrong place but when I include the keyboard at the bottom, the keyboard does not show and the RL takes up the entire screen.p  pHelp This kind of inconsistency drives me nuts and I am on the verge of hurling the computer across the room.p  pThe activitys XMLp  precodeltLinearLayout

Negative 2438 pIm very new to inno script. I have created a setup file using inno script and I have included one text file in that script.

Negative 2438 pI have a WebView into which Im loading the facebook sharer php page.  This page doesnt have any form of confirmation, it simply closes the window once the user has either shared or cancelled. p  pSince it is loaded into a web view there is nothing to close perse, so, I need to detect the window trying to close and act on that callback.p  pFrom my various searches it appears that the way to handle this is via a WebChromeClient.  So, Im attempting the following, but the callback is never called.  I am obviously missing something, but dont know what. It feels like the onCloseWindow event should be Overriden, but that causes eclipse to complain reasonably that I need to super the instance, which the documentation doesnt seem to suggest is possible. p  pAll help appreciated.p  p[EDIT] oh, and I just tried swapping the order of the actions, setting the WebChromeClient before calling the url, and as I expected that didnt alter the behavior in any way.p  precodewebview.getSettings.setJavaScriptEnabledtrue     webview.getSettings.setJavaScriptCanOpenWindowsAutomaticallytrue      webview.setWebViewClientnew WebViewClient      webview.loadUrlhttpwww.facebook.comsharersharer.phpuhttpEXTRACTED.comimgidabc  getIntent.getStringExtrauserId     WebChromeClient wbc  new WebChromeClient          public void onCloseWindowWindow w             Log.dTAG, Window trying to close                    webview.setWebChromeClientwbc codepre
Negative 2438 pIm experimenting with Hadoop and created a very simply map and reduce job.

Negative 2438 pI would like to know how you can parse the content of an HTML block and at the same time sustain the order of the strings as they appear in the HTML document by using a hrefhttpsgithub.comtopfunkyhpple relnofollowthis Hpplea wrapper which works with XPath expressions. The environment is iOS.p  pExamplep  precodelthtmlgt ltbodygt ltdivgt Lorem ipsum lta href...gtdolorltagt sit ltbgtamet,ltbgt consectetur ltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pLets say we want to parse all the strings inside the codeltdivgtcode tag in the original order so that we get this resultp  precodeLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur codepre  pThe sticking point of this is sustaining the order of strings. Its easy to get all the direct content of codeltdivgtcode as well as that of codeltagtcode and codeltbgtcode seperately or at the same time using an XPath expression which however omits the order, so might result in putting the content of codeltagtcode and codeltbgtcode in the end of the string.p  pHow can you achieve this using an XPath expression with the mentioned wrapperp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pOne way to achieve this with the mentioned wrapper and platform especially libxml2 seems to be the following XPath expressionp  precodedivdescendantorselftext codepre  pHowever the resulting elements are seperated and not delivered as one string so that they have to be concatenated manually.p

Currently I am returning all results WHERE status  Completedp  pThis has worked fine for now, but what I would really like to do is place a checkbox on the page just above the datatable and when checked it would show all records including those that are completed.p  pQuestion is, can I do some kind of callback on the check box to dynamically omit the where clause, or do I deliver ALL records to datatables and filter it there My only worry with that is when the database gets large, returning all records may take a while and 90 of the time they will be filtered out.p  pEither way, code snippets would be very helpfulp  pThanksp

Negative 2438 pIm trying to split some prior crafted code into a DLL. Its a simple logger system.p  pThere are a few things that need to be shared with the main form in the project, so I set them up as a shared variable, but I dont use shared stuff often, and I worry it will cause variable conflicts regarding scope. I figured I would make a post here about it and see if someone can explain what I dont fully understand.p  pSince this is a logger it will be used a couple of places. Other DLLs that need logging may reference it through a instanced object and project reference. My main form will also have an instanced object and a reference to the logger libary.p  pSince one of my properties is a connection string and its shared, does this mean that a instance of my logger class inside a DLL will have the same shared values as a instance on my main UI form Or will the fact that the instance is inside of a DLL provide the scope boundary I need Im hoping it does..p  pI mainly worry that I might want to log using two different connection strings down the road. p  pI hope my question makes sense.

Negative 2438 pI have a very old and poorly written Rails app. There are about 9000 lines of code and zero tests. Most of the code is in controllers, and even worse, there are tons of external API calls, system calls to random scripts, etc.p  pThere is also no development environment, everything is set up to work against the production databases. Well not just one database, there are about 10 different databases, since the app is kind of admin backend for a larger site.p  pMy first idea was to get at least somewhat decent test coverage around the parts that Im going to work on, but Im unable to get the thing working anywhere else than on the production servers.p  pAlso there are tons of old gems and deprecated warnings, but I cant even think about upgrading the gems until there are tests. Rewrite of the whole up is not an option, and Im going to have to addchange stuff soon.p  pIm not really sure how to approach testing such an app, since theres just so much stuff that can go wrong. What Id really like to do, is to write some integration tests and then start refactoring, but I cant do that on a production environment. p  pWriting unit tests with bunch of stubs and mocks doesnt seem that helpful, since the code Im going to work on basically has to be rewritten from scratch.p  pWhat are some steps I can take to basically duplicate a hugeass complex production environment on my development machine, so I can do stuff in isolation p  pstrongeditstrong A little fun fact about the app. When I tried to run it for the first time, it kept on freezing without any error messages ... until about a half hour later I found out, that the timeout to connecting to a database which wasnt available was set to strong90 minutesstrongp

Negative 2438 pCan you detect whether or not a debugger is attached to your native Windows process by using a high precision timer to time how long it takes to divide an integer by zerop  pThe rationale is that if no debugger is attached, you get a hard fault, which is handled by hardware and is very fast.

Negative 2438 pIve got a number that needs to be compared against 3 character strings.  The number is never more than 3 digits long.p  pSo for example, i need to compare 3, 300, and 13 to strings like 003 300 and 013. p  pI think the easiest way to compare would be if I could get the ints into their string format, and then use strcmp to compare 003 to 003. p  pIm just not sure how I can determine how many characters need to be padded, and particularly how to assign and convert properly. p  pAny suggestions I was thinking I could check if the codenumber  100 lt 0code. If it was, it means the number needs to be padded not just converted. I could also do codenumber  10 lt 0code to see if its a number like code13code or code3code. So i can determine the exact number of zeroes to pad, but Im lost after that.p  pThanks for any help p

Negative 2438 pI have had a template for some time which wrappers a C library FILE.  Its a fairly classic implementation of a shared pointer to a wrapper class for the FILE.  The reasoning behind using my own custom shared pointer is to provide free function replacements for some of the C library FILE free functions, in order to allow me to do a dropin replacement of legacy code that works with FILE.p  pThe implementation that I have uses an inner wrapper that guarantees that when it is deleted, the owned FILE is closed. RAII.p  pHowever, Ive come into the need to create a similar system to handle the case where I want the underlying FILE to be flushed amp truncated, rather than closed when the last FILE holder is destroyed.  That is to say, I have an open FILE of the original guaranteedtoclose type, but wish to hand out an unowned copy of the FILE to another object that is going to guarantee that when its last instance is destroyed, that it will flush amp truncate the FILE rather than close it, hence leaving me with the underlying FILE in an open state, but with the contents of the stream flushed to disk and the file size reflecting only valid contents.p  pI have solved this trivially for compile time polymorphism.  But I need some way to supply runtime polymorphism, and I really dont want to put yetanotherlayerofindirection into this scenario i.e. if I used a polymorphic pointer to either an autoclose or autoflush FILE wrapper, Id be golden  but I really want to keep the same depth I have now and hide the polymorphism inside the custom shared pointer implementation.p  pBasically, if I have ap  precodetemplate ltclass WrapperTgt   class FilePointerT      public    omitted create, destroy, manipulate the underlying wrappered FILE   private   WrapperT  mpFileWrapper     ReferenceCount mrc    codepre  pObviously, tons of details omitted.  Suffice it to say that when the last one of these objects is deleted, it deletes the last mpFileWrapper in fact, if I were rewriting this code, Id probably use a boostsharedptr.p  pRegardless, the real issue here is I am stumped on how to have a FilePointerTltWrapperTgt whose WrapperT can vary, but can then be used in code as if they were all the same which, after all, they are, since the implementation of WrapperT has zero affect on the structure and interface of FilePointerT essentially a pimpl.p  pWhat can I declare that can possibly hold any FilePointerTltWrapperTgt for any WrapperTp  pOr, how can I change the definition of FilePointerT in order to allow me to supply specific WrapperTp

Negative 2438 pI would like to transport over the LLCP a custom data within the NDEF message in one NDEF record or possibly the payload will be chunked across several NDEF records. The transported content is a file with a specific format that has meaning only in specific application. So, what is the best approach for specifying the NDEF headerp  p1 Set TNF to 0x04 NFC Forum External Type, 0x03 Absolute URI or 0x05 Unknown The 0x04 will have in the TYPE field custom relative URI and in the case of 0x03 absolute URI. The 0x05 I do not like much, since the receiving device cannot identify the application for processing data, because the TYPE must be empty in that case here only the ID field can help.p  p2 The ID field is for the NDEF message uniqueness, so can be either empty or will contain the custom identifier in a form e.g. codecom.company.nfc.applicationnameampidmessagegenerateduuidcodep  pMy opinion is  use of the TNF 0x03 or 0x04 is a preferred way, with leaving the ID empty unless the messages will need some additional identification, which will be better to transport outside of the payload.p  pBR STeNp

Negative 2438 pHaving searched online for different approaches to the Factory pattern, Ive implemented my own version which Im quite satisfied with. The emRegisterem member function creates a function pointer for the template type, storing it in a emstdmapem using the index as the key. This below code compiles and runs without hassle Windows 7 64bit, CodeBlocks 10.05 with GCC.p  precodeifndef OBJECTFACTORYHPP define OBJECTFACTORYHPP  include ltmapgt  namespace internal      templatelttypename BaseType, typename ObjectTypegt     BaseType CreateFunction          return new ObjectType        templatelttypename BaseType, typename IndexTypegt class ObjectFactory      public         ObjectFactory          templatelttypename ObjectTypegt         bool Registerconst IndexTypeamp index          bool Unregisterconst IndexTypeamp index          BaseType Createconst IndexTypeamp index      private         typedef BaseType creationCallback         typedef stdmapltIndexType, creationCallbackgt Registry         Registry registry      private         templatelttypename ObjectTypegt         BaseType CreateFunction   templatelttypename BaseType, typename IndexTypegt ObjectFactoryltBaseType, IndexTypegtObjectFactory      registry.clear   templatelttypename BaseType, typename IndexTypegt templatelttypename ObjectTypegt bool ObjectFactoryltBaseType, IndexTypegtRegisterconst IndexTypeamp index      if registry.findindex  registry.end         return false      registry[index]  ampinternalCreateFunctionltBaseType, ObjectTypegt      registry[index]  ampCreateFunctionltObjectTypegt lt FAILS     return true   templatelttypename BaseType, typename IndexTypegt bool ObjectFactoryltBaseType, IndexTypegtUnregisterconst IndexTypeamp type      if registry.findtype  registry.end         return false      return registry.erasetype  1   templatelttypename BaseType, typename IndexTypegt BaseType ObjectFactoryltBaseType, IndexTypegtCreateconst IndexTypeamp index      if registry.findindex  registry.end         return NULL      return registry[index]   templatelttypename BaseType, typename IndexTypegt templatelttypename ObjectTypegt BaseType ObjectFactoryltBaseType, IndexTypegtCreateFunction      return new ObjectType   endif codepre  pMy original approach was to have emCreateFunctionem as a private member to hide it from users look at the commented sections, note the nonmember function takes an additional template argument. However, this fails with the following error messages, all pointing to the line where I store the function pointer in the emRegisterem member functionp  precodeIn member function bool ObjectFactoryltBaseType, IndexTypegtRegisterconst IndexTypeamp [with ObjectType  Triangle, BaseType  Shape, IndexType  stdbasicstringltchar, stdchartraitsltchargt, stdallocatorltchargt gt] instantiated from here error no matches converting function CreateFunction to type class Shape  error candidates are templateltclass ObjectTypegt BaseType ObjectFactoryCreateFunction [with ObjectType  ObjectType, BaseType  Shape, IndexType  stdbasicstringltchar, stdchartraitsltchargt, stdallocatorltchargt gt] codepre  pI wrote a small test client for testingp  precodeinclude ObjectFactory.hpp include ltiostreamgt  class Shape      public         Shape          virtual void print  stdcout ltlt At heart, Im a shape    class Triangle  public Shape      public         Triangle          void print  Shapeprint stdcout ltlt , but Im truly a triangle ltlt stdendl    int mainint argc, char argv[]      ObjectFactoryltShape, stdstringgt objectFactory      objectFactory.RegisterltTrianglegttriangle      Shape triangle  objectFactory.Createtriangle     trianglegtprint      delete triangle      return 0  codepre  pIs this even possible I feel it should be, and I understand that Im somehow calling the incorrect member function, but Im cant see why. On a related note, since someone might mention it, I plan on using boostsharedptr for the allocation instead of the plain new operator  Any other advice or suggestions about the implementation are also welcome.p

Negative 2438 pIm plan on deploy a Java application to Google AppEngine and use federated login still experimental according to Google. The application is pretty simple Java EE application which expose RESTful interface for simple CRUD operations.p  pI then want to be able to authenticate to this application using Windows Client Application written in C. I think the application should be able to open a window with a browser in ti which will present the login page of my web application and after successful authentication I should be able to get the login token or a cookie to use in the rest of my HTTP requests.p  pIs it possible to do such thing using federated login a hrefhttpdalelane.co.ukblogp894 relnofollowIve found a post explain how to do it using google proprietary login.ap  pThank you, Ido.p
Negative 2438 pIm writing some sort of Geometry Wars inspired game except with added 2d rigid body physics Ai pathfinding some waypoint analysis line of sight checks load balancing etc. It seems that even though with around 80100 enemies on screen it can work reasonably fast with all  that stuff enabled the performance completely breaks down once you get to a total of 250 150 enemies objects or so. Ive searched for any On2 parts in the code but there dont seem to be any left. Im also using spatial grids.p  pEven if I disable pretty much everything from the supposedly expensive Ai related processing it doesnt seem to matter, it like still breaks down at 150 enemies.p  pNow I implemened all the code from scratch, currently even the matrix multiplication code, and Im almost completely relying on the GC as well as using C closures for some things, so I expect this to be seriously far from being optimized, but still it doesnt make sense to me that with like 115 of the processing work but double the objects the game suddenly starts to slow down to crawl Is this normal, how is the XNA platform normally supposed to scale as far as the amount of objects being processed is concerned p  pI remember Some slerp spinning cube thing I did at first could handle more than 1000

Negative 2438 pI have an old style .NET ASMX SOAPXML webservice that is used to upload data to a central service with a very simple and lightweight ack response.  This has been in place for years and has worked perfectly well.p  pHowever, usage has now changed a little and the overall size of the payload data being sent has increased to the point where it is no longer feasiblereliable to send the data uncompressed.p  pSo the question is how can I enable compression on the data sent from the client to the webservice.p  pHaving Googled around there are countless pages regarding compressing the response from the service, however I need to compress the request.p  pBear in mind that this has to remain as an ASMX and has to remain on .NET 2p  pEDIT  As an interim measure I am manually compressing GZIP the payload data before it is sent and then uncompressing on the other side.

Negative 2438 pstrongHere is the basic problemstrongp  pWe have an ASP.NET MVC 3 application thats worked on by people with Visual Studio and people without. The people who have Visual Studio are the ASP.NET devs who do all the programming. We also have frontend engineers who handle all the images, HTML, CSS, etc.p  pThe application is compiled and deployed to a web server. Right now, we have everything in an SVN repo structured like thisp  pdeployp  p[css]p  p[images]p  p [etc.]p  papplicationp  p[VS Studio Solution]p  p[Web Project]p  p[web folders]p  pAll the files are deployed to the web server from SVN. The ASP.NET devs create a build, its added to the deploy folder binaries, css, images, cshtml, etc. and deployed automatically on commit. This part is working quite well.p  pThe problem is with the frontend guys. They do not have Visual Studio, nor know how to work Visual Studio, nor emwantem to work in VS. We dont really want to make them work in Visual Studio either. However, when they make a change to the cshtml file, they have to change it in the deploy folder, commit to see the change this is all deployed to a dev server, then when they are finished, copy over all the changes files over to the application folder and overwrite or edit the .cshtml files.p  pThis is a terrible process that causes a lot of headaches. Also, there is no resolution for when they need to add an image. The ASP.NET devs have to add the image using Visual Studio manually.p  pstrongThe questionstrongp  pemWhat is the best way to structure our SVN or git repos so that everyones changes get mergedupdated properly without having to copy over files into the other sides folderem. Ideally, this would all avoid having to purchase and train the frontend devs in Visual Studio because we dont want them doing builds and deploying those files. And, the Visual Studio web project is typically filled with a lot of things we dont want deployed to the server .debug and .release web.config files, binDeployableAssemblies, .pdb files, etc.p  pIm looking for a good workflow, splitting out the deploy folder, using submodules in git or anything really. Im fully open to whatever solution would be best. We have a big enough team to implement some larger solutions.p  pstrongHow do you guys do this at your current jobsstrongp

Negative 2438 pI have tried just about everything at this point, but I cannot get a like or a comment to show up as my user, if I am logged in as the admin of a page. My app allows people to manage their pages, but even if I pass my users access token back instead of my pages access token, it still performs the action as though it were the page.

I create a codeprivatecode collection on my entity and expose a codepublic ReadOnlyCollectionltTgtcode so codeMyEntitycode looks like thisp  precodepublic class MyEntity      private readonly ICollectionltOtherEntitygt others  new CollectionltOtherEntitygt      public virtual IEnumerableltOtherEntitygt              get                      return others.AsEnumerable                codepre  pThis strongseemsstrong to be what Im looking for and my unit tests pass fine, but I havent yet started to do any integration testing so Im wonderingp  ol liIs there a better way to achieve what Im looking forli liWhat are the implications Ill face if I decide to go down this route if feasibleli ol  pThanks always for any and all help.p  pstrongEdit 1strong Ive changed from using a codeReadOnlyCollectioncode to codeIEnumerablecode and am using codereturn others.AsEnumerablecode as my getter. Again unit tests pass fine, but Im unsure of the problems Ill face during integration and EF starts building these collections with related entities.p  pstrongEdit 2strong So, I decided to try out suggestions of creating a derived collection call it codeValidatableCollectioncode implementing codeICollectioncode where my code.Addcode method would perform validation on the entity provided before adding it to the internal collection. Unfortunately, Entity Framework invokes this method when building the navigation property  so its not really suitable.p

Negative 2438 pI realize that structs are meant to be immutable, that mutating structs is evil, and the proper way to change values in a struct is by creating new instances. However, I am not clear on the memory and performance aspectsissues of new instances versus allowing the struct to be mutable.p  pSuppose I have the struct,p  precodestruct Vehicle      public readonly int Number     public readonly double Speed, Direction      public Vehicleint number, double speed, double direction              this.Number  number         this.Speed  speed         this.Direction  direction       codepre  pAnd  create it asp  precodeVehicle car codepre  pas well asp  precodeVehicle plane  new Vehicle1234, 145.70, 73.20 codepre  pIf I need to assign to Number, Speed, or Direction later, I could remove the readonly and make the struct mutable  I know it is eveil to do this.  thereby mutating an already created struct value.p  pAlternatively I could create a new struct instance. So instead of saying car.Speed  120.7 I could say car  new Vehiclecar.Number, 178.55, car.Direction. That would create a new struct value almost like the old value, only with the Speed changed. But it wouldnt mutate the existing struct value.p  pHere is the issue. Suppose, as an extreme example, I need to update the speed andor the direction many, many thousands of times per second. I would think that the creation of this many instances would severely impact memory and performance, and that in this case it would be better to allow the struct to be mutable. p  pCan anyone please clarify the memory and performance issues of a mutable struct versus the proper way to implement a struct in this type of an extreme casep

Negative 2438 pI am using springsecurityfacebook0.10.4 to integrate Facebook authentication for SSO in our Grails application. One of our requirements is to allow a user to turn SSO on or off via some control in our app. If its turned on, then we want to use the springsecurityfacebook filter for authentication. If SSO is turned off on our app, we want to use the default spring security filter for authentication regardless of whether a Facebook cookieauth token exists or not. p  pIm not sure how to configure the springsecurityfacebook plugin to allow for this use case. Right now, I have the Transparent cookie based authorization FacebookAuthCookieTransparentFilter working, and it works great. The problem is that it will try to authenticate through Facebook on every page. I cant see a way that I can control this so I can check to see if a user has turned on SSO in our app, and only use the Facebook auth filter if SSO is turned on. p  pIm thinking I have to use Manual cookie based authorization FacebookAuthCookieDirectFilter instead, but I dont know how to configure it.

Same as FacebookAuthCookieTransparentFilter, it parse Facebook cookie, but only for specified url. Like usernamepassword filter from springsecuritycore or similar. After successful authorization it can redirect user to specified url. p  pIs Manual cookie based authorization the way to go for my requirement How can I configure it to work only for users who have turned on SSO in our app How do I configure it to redirect user to specified url.p

Negative 2438 pIm writing a C WPF application which creates pictures .jpeg files.p  pWhat I want to do is draw text on the picture inside a given area using the graphics library. Since I dont know how long the text will be I want to resize the font in such a way, that the text will be shown without leaving too much space of the given area empty and without being cut for long texts  it should just lower the font size until the text fits inside.p  pCurrently Im using a codeSystem.Drawing.RectangleFcode to define the space for the text because it allows me to wrap the text automatically when I insert it using codeGraphics.DrawStringcode.p  pUnfortunately I couldnt find a useful way to resize the text accurately and so I wrote a method that counts the characters of the string and lowers the size depending on how many characters I thought might being cut off. Its a very ugly approach that took a lot of tinkering and rechecking of the output image without ever being actually accurate.p  pIs there a better way to measure and adjust the size of my text in C p  pOr maybe it doesnt even have to be measured and theres something like the XAML codeViewBoxcode around for drawing graphics that I just dont know of yetp

Negative 2438 pI have a strange habit it seems... according to my coworker at least. Weve been working on a small project together. The way I wrote the classes is simplified examplep  precode[Serializable] public class Foo      public Foo            private Bar bar      public Bar Bar              get                      if bar  null                 bar  new Bar              return bar                  set  bar  value        codepre  pSo, basically, I only initialize any field when a getter is called and the field is still null. I figured this would reduce overload by not initializing any properties that arent used anywhere.p  pETA The reason I did this is that my class has several properties that return an instance of another class, which in turn also have properties with yet more classes, and so on. Calling the constructor for the top class would subsequently call all constructors for all these classes, when they are not emalwaysem all needed.p  pAre there any objections against this practice, other than personal preferencep  pUPDATE I have considered the many differing opinions in regards to this question and I will stand by my accepted answer. However, I have now come to a much better understanding of the concept and Im able to decide when to use it and when not.p  pConsp  ul liThread safety issuesli liNot obeying a setter request when the value passed is nullli liMicrooptimizationsli liException handling should take place in a constructorli liNeed to check for null in class codeli ul  pProsp  ul liMicrooptimizationsli liProperties never return nullli liDelay or avoid loading heavy objectsli ul  pMost of the cons are not applicable to my current library, however I would have to test to see if the microoptimizations are actually optimizing anything at all.p  pLAST UPDATEp  pOkay, I changed my answer. My original question was whether or not this is a good habit. And Im now convinced that its not. Maybe I will still use it in some parts of my current code, but not unconditionally and definitely not all the time. So Im going to lose my habit and think about it before using it. Thanks everyonep

Negative 2438 pIn the Scala standard library there are several occurrences of the pattern Explicit instantiation to reduce class file size in subclasses. Here for instance in Iterator.scalap  precode Explicit instantiation of the Iterator trait to reduce class file size in subclasses.  private[scala] abstract class AbstractIterator[A] extends Iterator[A] codepre  pIn the whole source file, the abstract class is used to construct anonymous classes instead of the trait itself. Clearly the comment already gives enough motivation why this is done.

Negative 2438 pI have a question about a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppmemoryuniqueptrcodestduniqueptrcodea and a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcppmemorysharedptrcodestdsharedptrcodea. I know there are loads of questions about when to use which one, but Im still not sure if I understand it correctly. I read somewhere that the default choice for smart pointer should be codestduniqueptrcode, but as I understand it, for my needs I should rather use codestdsharedptrcode. For example, I havep  precodeclass B class A  private    B b public    B getB   AgetB     return b  codepre  pSo basically class codeAcode owns pointer to object of type codeBcode and theres a method which returns this pointer. If I create getter, I assume that some other class can access this pointer and therefore it should be codesharedptrcode instead of codeuniqueptrcode. Am I right, or I dont get it yetp

Negative 2438 pemstrong[EDIT, Completely rephrased] Seems like my question was poorly worded indeed, and poorly received too. So I hope that this complete rephrasing helps...emstrong p  pMSDN tells clearly specifies a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.forms.control.begininvoke.aspxControl.BeginInvokea Executes a delegate on the thread that the controls handle was created on, normally this would be the GUI thread. And a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.threading.dispatcher.begininvoke.aspxDispatcher.BeginInvokea will run on the thread where the Dispatcher object was created. This would be any thread created by me.p  pBut for delegates emthe a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary2e08f6yc28vvs.11029.aspxCLR automatically definesa BeginInvoke and EndInvokeem and these calls run on a ThreadPoolthread instead. Apart from this slightly surprising different behaviour I wonder how I can find the specs of all functions that automatically get implemented. p  pFor example Intellisense shows that my delegate has a DynamicInvoke. Class a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryy22acf51.aspxSystem.Delegatea does have a DynamicInvoke which might imply that my delegate inherits it. But Delegate has no BeginInvoke. And Delegate has several functions that my delegate has not. Also my delegate gets a GetObjectData method.

The view updates without a hitch every time the codedttickcode is called and the codeifstopWatch.IsRunningcode evaluates to true. Where I am running into a problem is when codesampleCountcode is incremented when codeifts.Seconds8  0code is true. I dont know if its a race condition because I am still learning threads but the codeTextBoxSampleCountDigitcode updates rapidly and erratically not at intervals of 8 seconds as it should. Honestly, from what I know of threading I dont understand why this happening or why this would be a race condition when both of these member variables sampleCount and currentTime are updated within the dtTick event handler code.p  pWhy would this be happening and what can I do to update my SampleCountDigit view so that every 8 seconds as it should Should a new thread be written around the update of this elementp  pstrongEDITstrong To give a better insight into the behavior of the problem, when I set a breakpoint on codeSampleCountDigit.Text  sampleCount.ToStringcode the code stops perfectly at 8, 16, 24 seconds and so on... and the SampleDigitCounter on my view updates properly thereafter.p

Anyway, I was wondering how I may solve the following.p  pI want to have a sensor doesnt matter what type it is, lets say a temperature sensor.

Lets say the circuitry has been built and its giving the data I need  via a desktop appp  pMy question isp  ul liList item I want to convert the sensor output to a 3D graph any ideas guys, I want to be able to show the graph on PCsmartphones so think a web interface the best approach  unless someoneanyone has better ideas and most importantly linksli liList item I want to show the temperature changegraph in real time absolutely crucial through the web interface .li ul  pI think, the conversion of the data would have to be done serverside. Im thinking and I may be wrong so please do correctp  ul liList item Client side  Get sensor data via the desktop appli liList item Client side  Transmit data via the desktop app  not sure how this would be done yetli liList item Server side  Convert data to graphli liList item Server side  Transmit datagraphli liList item Client side  Receive datali liList item Client side  Show graphli ul  pIf this were just a question of rendering a sensors data to a PC screen self contained application  I would feel confident to tackle it. However, I think where Im getting stuck is the renderingtransmitting and displaying of the 3D images in real time using web technology, platforms and languages. If it helps, I am just picking up Php, MySql and python. I already know CCVB and assembly.p  pI hope this makes sense, any starting points that you can give will be greatly appreciated Jason p

Negative 2438 pSimilar questions have been asked to this, but my predicament is actually the opposite of theirs. Ive got a fullscreen, paging codeUIScrollViewcode, with each page being the size of the screen. Inside of that, Ive got some pages that are themselves codeUIScrollViewscode, with their width greater than the screen width. The inner scrollviews are within a few layers of other codeUIViewscode, they are not direct subviews of the outer scrollview.p  pWhat Id like is that, when I get to the end of one of the inner scrollviews, it starts scrolling the outer scrollview. From other questions I see on here, it looks like that should happen, but for some reason it doesnt. What in my setup could be causing this to stop happening Where in the touch stack is the handoff supposed to happen between inner and outer scrollingp  pedit Is there any way to pass touches or pan gesture commands out to the outer scroll view using I sense the inner view is past its bounds via codescrollViewDidScrollcode delegate methodp
Negative 2438 pI am trying to read an xmlfeed into a database on a specific time with cron jobs. Everything is working fine the cron job calls the page and the xmlscript starts running and reading into the database except that i dont want someone else to be able to run the script by visiting this page. Therefore I have been looking at setting up a passwordprotected page for this script, but there is not a lot of information about how to do this with cron jobs and asp.net.p  pIt seems to be so much easier with php use the htaccessfile and send the username and password with the cronjob url like a hrefhttpusernamepasswordyoursite.comcron relnofollowhttpusernamepasswordyoursite.comcrona. Is it possible to do this with asp.net sites p  pI have to use cron job since my web hosting provider dont have windows task scheduler.p  pThanks, Axelp

The visibility of buttons is declared in the inner containers that would be the codespancode tags in the example above. I want to round corners of the last VISIBLE label, thus I need to find the last outer container that has an inner container declaring its visibility.p  pPerhaps there is a different workaround for this As a last resort, Id accept a JS solution, as long as its based on native ExtJS componentselements traversing syntax, rather than jQuery.p  pPlease ask for more detail if needed.p
Negative 2438 pSo I added a bunch of images to my project that has git enabled. I then renamed all the images in Xcode. Now whenever I select commit, these files with the old file name pop up with a question mark. The question mark indicates they are not under source control, I believe, which is fine. They should not be. So how can I get them out of the list How can I avoid this from happening in the future, other than renaming outside of the project before importingp  pNote I did not check them in or commit them before renaming. At least I dont think I committed them. They are not in the remote, nor do I want them to be.p

Negative 2438 pI am trying to register a BroadcastReceiver programmatically to receive codeandroid.intent.action.MEDIAMOUNTEDcode.  However, the codeonReceivecode method never gets triggered.  The same BroadcastReceiver class I created works fine if I register is statically in the apps manifest file.p  pWhy is this the case  Is there a way to troubleshoot this  I need to register dynamically because my BroadcastReceiver class contains members that I want a service to query later on.

Essentially, how can I make my files private but downloadable with a signed URL and is my signing method correct. If I delete the generated bucket policy access is restricted again. I think I need to know how to set the bucket policy so that the origin access identity can only access the bucket with a signed URL... maybe.p  pMany thanks in advance for any help p

Negative 2438 pWhats the diference between using relational database and relational databaseobjecthybrid.p  pIm making an application of adverts. Using common relational database, i think I could make  tables of each type of adverts cars,technology,estates,employment, services, this is the way a I do it.But reading about relational databaseobject I found that you can create a type field in the databaseOracle that allows you to encapsulate another fields and methods, so what if I make only a table of adverts, knowing that all adverts have fields in common like title, description,the date it publish, images, but I can add a field that encapsulate another objects that will be cars,technology, employment, and inside of each one encapsulate attributes to them like  carsmodel,brand,price,  technologystate,price,accesories,dimensions  emloymentjob,paymentp  pWell this is the idea, actually for every advert you can actually enlarged the functionality, making a database for each one. My question is what are the potencial problems using relational databaseobject What is the best optionp

Negative 2438 pI am trying to define conjunction codeProccode and disjunction codeProccode on codeProccode class. When the receiver and the argument have different arity, then it should raise an error. Otherwise, it should return a proc object that is conjunctiondisjunction, respectively. I implemented them as followsp  precodeclass Proc   def  other     raise ArgumentError, Arity does not match unless arity  other.arity     gtargscallargs and other.callargs   end   def  other     raise ArgumentError, Arity does not match unless arity  other.arity     gtargscallargs or other.callargs   end end codepre  pThis works well with simple procsp  precodep  gtxx  2  0  gtxx  3  0 p.call2  gt false p.call6  gt true codepre  pbut it raises an error when I further try to build on the result of these methodsp  precodeq  p  gtxx  5  0  gt Error, Arity does not match codepre  pThis is because the arity of codegtxx  5  0code is code1code, whereas the arity of codepcode is code1code due to codecallargscode in my implementation.p  pIs there any good way to make the methods codeProccode and codeProccode work recursivelyp  phr If I remove the coderaise ...code from the definition, then it will work, but then, it will return misleading error messages when procs with different arity are conjoineddisjoined. For example, suppose the coderaise ...code part is deleted from the definition above, and I dop  precodep  gtxx  2  0  gtx, y, zx  3  0 codepre  pthen codeProccode will not raise an error, but will return a valid proc object. However, since part of it requires one argument and another part requires three arguments, there would be no way to pass arguments to codepcode in a valid way.p  precodep.call2  gt error codepre  pwill raise an codeArgumentErrorcode, sayingp  precodeWrong number of arguments codepre  pbut the mistake actually happened when creating codepcode that cannot be satisfied with any number of arguments, and the error message would be misleading. That is why I added the coderaise ...code check. Is removing the coderaise ...code only way to make it workp

Ive tried three different configurations but havent gotten one to work successfully yet.p  pScenario 1p  pI added a codeUILongPressGestureRecognizercode to my custom codeUITableViewCellcode class and was handling the action showing an action sheet inside an action that was part of the custom cell class. This worked but introduced the necessity to link the object the cell was rendering and then left me no way to update the tables data source the action sheet is for removing items so I abondoned this despite the codeUIActionSheetcode setup working fine.p  pScenario 2p  pAdd the codeUILongPressGestureRecognizercode to the table view but handle its action by the controller that contains the table view Im using a generic codeUITableViewcode. In the action for the gesture recognizer I tried doingp  precodeif sender.state  UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan      CGPoint point  [sender locationInViewself.tableView]     NSIndexPath indexPath  [self.tableView indexPathForRowAtPointpoint]      if indexPath  nil         return       Fetch item from index path and show action sheet  codepre  pThis was failing out at the test codeif indexPath  nilcode.p  pScenario 3p  pI found an example of adding a codeUILongPressGestureRecognizercode on each cell when theyre created and did so while still using the same handler in the controller containing the table view. I then changed the above test top  precodeif sender.state  UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan      NSIndexPath indexPath  [self.tableView indexPathForCellMyCustomCell [sender view]]      if indexPath  nil         return       Fetch item from index path and show action sheet  codepre  pAgain, this is continuously failing at the test codeif indexPath  nilcode.p  pIs there something I must do on a table view in order to fetch an index path or am I performing these checks in the wrong place Is there a better method for adding a preferably nonvisible means for showing a delete confirmationp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAdding additional info in response to Joels comment.p  pHere is the view in question loaded in the simulator a hrefhttpgrab.byrHTA relnofollowhttpgrab.byrHTAap  pTo provide some visual information, the selected row in the view 3rd from the top is the one I will be performing the long press gesture on for the context of the following logs.p  precode20131103 104208.434 Application[3539270b] Long press point  143.000000, 168.000000 20131103 104208.434 Application[3539270b] IndexPath is nil codepre  pAs you can see by the log codeIndexPath is nilcode which is printed only if codeindexPath  nilcode evaluates to true that the table view is not returning an index path for the point.

Negative 2438 pI am new to Ubuntu and searched online for two days, tried a lot of solutions but do not have any luck yet. If anyone can help with this, I will appreciate.p  pI wrote a program in Java with eclipse on Windows. My program makes use of Java hidapi library, which is a Java wrapper of the C version hidapi library .dll. In eclipse, by adding the Java hidapi to the build path and setting the C hidapi as a native library, everything works just fine.p  pNow I want to do the same on Ubuntu. The same Java hidapi is used, which now will make use of the C version hidapi library for Linux a .so file. When making the C version hidapi library for Linux, it turns out that I need another library called libusb1.0 which hidapi needs to deals with the low level communication. So I install libusb1.0 now I have a libusb1.0.so file under usrlibi386linuxgnu, make the C version hidapi library for Linux. I have a small C program and I test it under bash, it works so I believe until this point everything, both libsub1.0.so and C version hidapi library for Linux libhidapijni.so are installedgenerated correctly, and when running the small C program the system is able to find the shared libusb1.0.so library without explicitly mentioning where libsub1.0 is which makes sense because libusb1.0 is installed in a place where the system loader will always search.p  pSo I go to eclipse. I import the eclipse work space, add the Java hidapi to the build path as I did in Windows, move the C version hidapi library for Linux the .so file into a folder called lib where the .dll version of native library also resides. And I set the native library to lib, by build path  configure build path  libraries tab  native library location. So till this point, the two native libraries are libusb1.0 under usrlibi386linuxgnu, and hidapi.so under wherever eclipse workspace islib. Finally in the source code I add two lines p  pSystem.loadLibraryusb1.0  Call this line A.p  pSystem.loadLibraryhidapijni  Call this line B.p  pI run the program as a Java application. It reports java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError no usb1.0 in java.library.path at line A. So I guess the Java runtime is not able to find where libsub1.0 is.p  pJust for clarification, I already did the following trials, none of them worked.p  ol liRemain the two libraries where they are, add vm argument Run  Run Configuration  Arguments  VM arguments Djava.library.pathworkspacelocprojectnamelib usrlibi386linuxgnu. It gives java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError no usb1.0 in java.library.path at line A.li liUndo 1. Move libsub1.0.so to wherever eclipse workspace islib, so now the two .so files are together. Set .jars native library location to this folder. It gives java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError blablabla undefined symbol libusbcontroltransfer at line B. So I think it founds the libusb library, however the symbol which should be in libusb is still unresolved. This is really weird.li ol  pCan anyone help me Thanks in advance.p

Negative 2438 pI am writing a multiplayer real time game for the browser with the server as a master instance and the clients as input devices and slaves to show the graphics.p  pI have to send out changes in the game world very often and very fast and it doesnt matter if some of the data sometimes gets lost on the way because a couple of milliseconds later there will be the next update anyway.p  pRight now I am using Socket.io to talk between the server and the clients but this uses TCP which makes the update come in unnecessary late sometimes.p  pI know that there is WebRTC with data channels where I would be able to send my updates through wit UDP which would be very awesome and exactly what I want. And it even seems to be implemented in Firefox and Chrome already a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma1286451263779httpstackoverflow.coma1286451263779ap  pWhat I now need is some Node library which would allow me to use data channels to send my data for now just JSON strings with help of UDP to the clients which are browsers. On the browser I would be able to use webkitRTCPeerConnection but I have no idea how to start something like that on the Node server. Any suggestions If there is no Node module for that, would it be possible to write something in some other language and just send the data via Unix domain sockets or somethingp

Negative 2438 pI use QtCreator  mingw.p  pI have compiled QSQLITE2 plugin.

So it looks like thisp  precodemy.dll                       depends on sqlite.dll QTPLUGINSqsqlite2d.dll   depends on sqlite.dll my.dll                       uses qsqlite2d.dll through Qts plugin engine myApp.exe                    loads my.dll codepre  pProblem is that my application cannot load my.dll, because of codeinvalid location accesscode or something like that. I dont know any details and thats the problem.p  pThe codesqlite.dllcode is in the application directory when running it.p  pWhen I run application in debug mode, it crashes in some assembly file, but in stack trace I can see that its somewhere inside sqlite.dll, in sqlitestep symbol. Thats all I know.p  pNote 1 I have another plugin dll, the codemy3.dllcode, which uses QSQLITE plugin its for sqlite3 and is linked with codesqlite3.dllcode and this one loads just fine. I have compiled QSQLITE plugin myself as well even there was the one provided with Qt, thats because Qt linked statically to sqlite3 and I wanted it to link dynamically to codesqlite3.dllcode.p  pNote 2 Both plugins work just fine under Linux.p  pAny hints what might be wrong What else can I checkp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIve just performed a test I deleted codemy.dllcode from plugins to avoid loading it at all.

Negative 2438 pI simulate a cache replacement algorithm. I have a cache implemented as an arraylist that fills in with the requested items objects of customtype Request. These objects are identified by their unique numeric ID reqID  for N items, an integer between 1 and N. I insert items in the cache from the start of the cache arraylist and evict them from the end. That is,p  precode insertion this.cache.add0, item   eviction this.cache.removethis.cache.size1     codepre  pI maintain the cache arraylist sorted according to the score of the items which I keep in a HashMap reqID K  score V.p  pAt some point in my code I have to check for cache reordering due to a cache hit since the score of that cached item is increased by 1. If required, in order to keep the cache ordered, the requested item and the item at its left in the cache arraylist will exchange position in the cache. p  pTherefore, I have to know the index of the requested item in the cache. I can use the followingp  precodeint ind  this.cache.indexOfrequest codepre  pand therefore the index of the next item at its left will bep  precodeint indLeft  ind  1 codepre  pand thus I will be able easilly to exchange their position in the cache arraylist. p  pHowever, I would really like to avoid using indexOf since it makes use internally of a for loop. Hence, I will have to store the positions of the items in some data structure. What kind of data structure would you suggest My first thought was a HashMap positions reqID  index due to constant complexity of the operations that I care about, but then I noticed that each time I insert an item in the cache, the index of the other items is increased by 1. How could I possibly increase by 1 the value of all the previous keys reqIDs in that positions map each time I put a new keyvalue pair without using a for loop Thus, probably some other data structure is required. Or some other idea...p

As I have keyboard shortcuts implemented in submenus as well, this means that if the user scans the barcode in the menu the application moves between menus. p  pI am not 100 sure but it seems that devices I use have barcode readers as keyboard wedge and when they are that kind you get text from them as if the user was typing it from the keyboard.p  pThis is how keypresses in the menu are implementedp  precodeprivate void mainListKeyPressobject sender, KeyPressEventArgs e                  switch e.KeyChar                              case charKeys.D1                     productRequestBtnClicksender, e                     break                 case charKeys.D2                     warehouseBtnClicksender, e                     break                 case charKeys.D3                     inventoryBtnClicksender, e                     break                 case charKeys.D4                     ordersBtnClicksender, e                     break                 case charKeys.D5                     discountBtnClicksender, e                     break                 case charKeys.D6                     intakeBtnClicksender, e                     break                 case charKeys.F1                     Close                     break                   codepre  pI have tried different ways to implement it but havent managed to solve my problem.p  pIf someone has any idea how to either change keyboard shortcuts implemented in menus, block a barcode reader or anything that might work in the described case, I would really appreciate it.p

Negative 2438 pso I know this questing has been asked, but all the answers that were given are already known to me. I dont want to make a variable of all the posible numbers that was always the answer. So to go to the question, I want to make a random number generator, that will generate me 7 numbers, that must not be the same. For example, I get random numbers 5,16,12,5,21,37,2 ... But I dont want the number 5 to be used again, so I want different numbers. I made a code for the generation, but I can not think of any good methodway to do this. I was thinking that maybe check if the number is already in array and if it is, then generate another number, but as Im amateur in JavaScript, I dont know how to do this.

Negative 2438 pRuby On Rails has a hrefhttpapidock.comrailsActiveRecordPersistencetouch relnofollowa neat featurea when a model Foo has a belongsto relationship to another model Bar Whenever a Foo is created or update, a timestamp field on the referenced Bar is updated. The thing is, the feature is implemented in the Rails layer and thus only works if rows are inserted or updated by the Rails application. In a hypothetical situation where several apps shared the same database, it wouldnt work, unless a similar mechanism existed in all the apps. p  pThe question is How can I implement this same feature in the database layer Is there some incantation having to do with triggers andor foreign keys that would do the trick p  pIf the question cannot be answered generally, I would be interested in specific solutions for both Postgres and Oracle.p

Negative 2438 pIm trying to get a total volume count of items that meet multiple requirements. In this table, each product sold has a distinct ID. Each product, however, can be paired with multiple attributes well call these colors. For example product with ID 1234 can have attributes blue and orange, both listed under the attribute column in a many rowstoone link to product ID.p  pWhat I am looking to do is count the number of products that have certain combinations of attributes. For example, how many products have orange and blue, not just orange or blue. To make this more complicated, I cannot pull the total number of product IDs, I will have to count them. Suffice it to say that I am pulling for a time period in which there were hundreds of millions of products sold, all with varying attribute combinations. To further complicate things, there are multiple codes per color. Blue, for example, can be coded either 01, or 950. p  pIs there a way that I can craft a SQL statement that will let me count the number of products that satisfy specific attribute combinations Such as, pulling the volume for Orange and Blue Blue and Green Green and Yellow etc.p  pI am at my wits end, and need some guidancep  pThank you in advancep

Negative 2438 pIm experiencing a very strange behavior with the MSVC compiler, compared to the MinGW. Im trying to build a library for windows .dll to include in a bigger MSVC project.p  pMy library has 108 .c files with their .h files.

I waited 24 hours and it has not even processed 20 of the files I check the progress by the output .obj files, wich also vary from 1 KB to 8 KB. Im not exaggerating.p  pIve tried some MSVC compiler switches such as Od which disables optimization, but I do not see any improvement in compile time, however, object files are 1 to 2.5MB is size Im using Qt to compile even if my project is purely C without using any Qt libraries. I used the switches this wayp  precodeQMAKECFLAGSRELEASE  O2 forget about optimizing speed QMAKECFLAGSRELEASE  Od disable optimization codepre  pIve also tried MSVC 2012 64 bits and MSVC 2013 64 bits but I get similar results.p  pAre there any MSVC compiler switches that I could use to improve speed while keeping the size small I would love to have the same compile time amp result as the MinGW compiler.p  pAny help would be appreciatedp  pPS Ive also taken a look on how to convert a MinGW dll into a library that can be imported in a MSVC project here a hrefhttpwww.mingw.orgwikiMSVCandMinGWDLLs relnofollowhttpwww.mingw.orgwikiMSVCandMinGWDLLsa However it does not look straightforward...

Negative 2438 pI am currently using the below code to load the jQuery masonry after all the images have loaded. It works great and as it should. However, if I am loading a large number of images it takes some time to show the masonry. I have tried multiple method to display a sort of loading image to show that the page is actually loading and is not just stagnant with no success.

Negative 2438 pIm using VS2013 Professional and I have 2 separate ASP.NET MVC projects, both created from scratch in VS2013 Pro.p  pBoth are using Code First to manage the database and both have migrations enabled via EnableMigrations in the Package Manager console. Some changes to the DB are required when the apps are installed on IIS. To do this I would like to use Code First Migrations to perform the DB updates.p  pThe problem Im having is when I come to publish each project into a Web Deploy Package and I check the Execute Code First Migrations runs on application start checkbox, strongI get slightly different results in the resulting ZIP packagestrong.p  pThe difference is that the web.config file on one project contains the additional codeltaddgtcode object for codeDatabasePublishcode within codeltconnectionStringsgtcode and also the codeMigrateDatabaseToLatestVersion2code databaseInitializer within the codeltcontextgtcode as expected. p  pstrongHowever the other project doesnt contain either of these additional elements which means that the DB changes dont get made when deployed to IIS.strongp  pIve compared the settings for both projects but cant seem to work out why there is a difference in the output. The only way I can get the failing project to output the required XML is to change the Configuration dropdown in the Publish wizard from Debug to Release. That isnt ideal because I would like to leave the configuration as Debug in this case Im releasing to UAT and want to be able to easily debug issues. I realise I could simply add the debug parameter back in once Ive deployed to IIS but would prefer to rely on VS to output the correct XML for me.p  pThe app which is working as expected successfully outputs the correct XML whether the Configuration is Debug or Release.p  pI guess I must be missing something so any pointers on what is restricting the correct XML in the failing project would be appreciated.p

The issue is, all Http Clients currently out there Apache, Ning, Spray, Ok etc.. all use very different implementations which makes my job very hard. p  pNow my question is, are there already prebuilt projects out there that I can utilize so the only thing I need to do is write the implementationsbr If not, what would be the best way to go about it It might be worth mentioning that my project is entirely Actor based a hrefhttpakka.io relnofollowAkkaa so interfacing isnt an option.p  pIm not asking for written code, just a concept since I cant quite wrap my head about how I would go about doing such thing.p

Negative 2438 pIm relatively new to programming and C, but Ive been trying to create my own delay function in C.  In essence, it would pause the program for the number of seconds the user puts  in. For examplep  precode    int main int argc, char argv[]        printfThere will now be a ten second pause.n       delay10       printfTen seconds have now passed.n       return 0      codepre  pThe program would print the first output, wait ten seconds, then print the last one. My current function looks like thisp  precode    void delayunsigned int seconds        timet oldtime  timeNULL, targettime  oldtime       whiletargettime  oldtime lt seconds targettime  timeNULL      codepre  pThe function is decently accurate with waiting the specified amount of time given. However, the the program does not print the first output before delaying, which is certainly not what I want  The program instead waits ten seconds as soon as the program starts, and then prints the two statements, instead of printing the first statement, delaying, then printing the last.p  pAm I missing something with my understanding of time Or will this not work for some reason Again, for clarification, Im trying to fix the problem where the delay happens BEFORE anything else in the program happens, even if the function comes after other functions. Any thoughts or suggestions for helping me understand this would be awesomep  pThanks p

Negative 2438 pI have an SVN repo URL like codehttpsvnprojecttrunkdirectorycode.  How can I test the existence of that directory in the repository, such that an error message is suppressed  It runs in a script with the SVN command line client on Linux.  I can test with codesvn ls URLcode or codesvn info URLcode and check the return value.  But that gives an error message if the URL does not existp  precodesvn warning W170000 URL httpsvnprojecttrunkdirectory nonexistent in revision 11853 svn E200009 Could not display info for all targets because some targets dont exist codepre  pIt is okay for the script if that happens, so I want to suppress the message.  But the message is on standard error.  I cannot redirect standard error to devnull because there might be a password dialog if a user accesses the repo for the first time.  A quiet option would be perfect, but that is not supported.  I could do an codesvn lscode for the parent directory, but that might not exist too.  The script should not make assumptions about the SVN repo root directory, e.g. for the URL codehttpserverdataprojectssvnprojecttrunkdirectorycode the repo root is codehttpserverdataprojectssvnprojectcode, so I cannot codesvn lscode from the repo root down to the directory.  That would also be time consuming if there are many hierarchy levels involved.  Other ideasp  pstrongEditstrong The password dialog used to be on standard error at least until 1.4, but now at least since 1.6 the password dialog directs output to devtty if not under Windows and devtty is available.p  pstrongEdit2strong The actual password dialog is not on standard error for 1.6, but the dialog that asks to store the password in plain text still is.  So standard error cannot be discarded for 1.6.  1.8 has both dialogs on devtty.p

Negative 2438 pSo, a week or so ago we switched from Crittercism to Crashlytics, for various reasons.  It came with a plugin for Eclipse that automated some of the process.  Kinda convenient, sure, I guess.  But yesterday another developer in the company pulled the code and installed the plugin, and we discover theyve changed it to Fabric, with Crashlytics becoming a part of Fabric, apparently.  Still fine, sure.  I figure, Ill update my plugin to match his.  Heres where things go wrong.  The plugin installs fine, and I get things set up again  but now whenever I start Eclipse, it adds another set of duplicate libraries.

Negative 2438 pIm working on a simple program in C, where we create a linked list with a structure that acts as a movie which stores, a title, year it was made, rating 15, and a pointer to the next node. We are not allowed to add anything to this structure, or define functions.p  pOn top of that, we for some reason are required to write the entire linked list in the body of main, so that adds a certain layer of spaghetti to the problem. Anyways, in this program, we are supposed to have the user enter either U for update or S for search for a movie. The update does what you would expect, you enter a title, year, rating. From this, we are supposed to insert the node at the strongendstrong of the linked list.p  pOur search should iterate through this linked list and if it finds a match, should print out the movie, title, and year.p  pAlthough the update part of my code works, I cant seem to get search to work.

Negative 2438 pIm a beginning with Ruby on Rails plagued by a seemingly simple task I havent been able to find an answer that lines up with my goal, so here I am.p  pThe page Im working on is for Journal Entries. There are two sections on this page the left half is a form for creating a new journal post, and the right half is a list of all posts the user has written. In Rails, I set up a scaffolding with JournalEntriesController and related views. The RESTful routes that were created work as expected I can go to emlocalhost3000journalentriesnewem and theres a form for creating a new journal entry, and I can go to emlocalhost3000journalentriesem to see all journal entries already created. Instead of going to these two separate pages, how can I put both actions on the same page, side by sidep  pAlong the same lines if I wanted a page to have four sections where the user could Create, Read, Update, and Destroy, how would I go about doing thisp  pI have a few theories on how I could do this, but seeing as Im pretty new to Rails, Im not sure if Id be hacking it together. Any insight is appreciated.p

Negative 2438 pI have a VB application which is scheduled. It focuses on some cmd windows and performs sendkey actions. This works fine when I have the RDP session open, its only when I disconnect not logoff that the issue occurs. This task is running on a virtualised server.p  pWhen I open the RDP session again after the task has ran, the application has thrown an error regarding the login permissions. I presume this is because the user is locked and therefore cant perform the actionsp  pI need to find a way around this, any help is much appreciatedp

Negative 2438 pI am implementing my own custom view in android. I have divided my view into a grid consisting of more then 500 cells. Each cell is represented by a Rect. Now I am setting a tile as background for each cell. So, for setting the background of whole view I am filling each cell with an image. Over it I have some movable items. So whenever I move an item I have to invalidate the whole view to update the elements position. So onDraw is called, which results in again filling each cell of the grid with a bitmap image. I want to avoid this, as I think this is computationally expensive Drawing bitmap for more then 500 cells.

Negative 2438 pIm using the SavitzkyGolay filter to smooth my data. I ran into a list of values that fall very quickly to values close to 0.0. The following figure is the original datap  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyXz7F.png altoriginal data p  pAfter applying the SavitzkyGolay filter, I get the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZHcMD.png altsmoothedp  pWe can see that it plots values below 0.0, which is wrong.p  pHere is the function I usep  precodedef savitzkygolayy, windowsize, order, deriv0, rate1     rSmooth and optionally differentiate data with a SavitzkyGolay filter.     The SavitzkyGolay filter removes high frequency noise from data.     It has the advantage of preserving the original shape and     features of the signal better than other types of filtering     approaches, such as moving averages techniques.     Parameters          y  arraylike, shape N,         the values of the time history of the signal.     windowsize  int         the length of the window. Must be an odd integer number.     order  int         the order of the polynomial used in the filtering.         Must be less then windowsize  1.     deriv int         the order of the derivative to compute default  0 means only smoothing     Returns          ys  ndarray, shape N         the smoothed signal or its nth derivative.     Notes          The SavitzkyGolay is a type of lowpass filter, particularly     suited for smoothing noisy data. The main idea behind this     approach is to make for each point a leastsquare fit with a     polynomial of high order over a oddsized window centered at     the point.

Negative 2438 pWe had a problem recently on our hand where client only had TLS 1.2 working, but our apps where built with .NET framework 4.0.p  pSo as worrkaround we told the client to instal .NET 4.5 and applied patch that included this  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma283333701010609httpstackoverflow.coma283333701010609ap  pSuprisingly when above code was put into Program.Main nothing happened, it still didnt work, but when we moved the code to .dll that contains calls to our legacy asmx web service added as web reference, it worked as expectedp  pIm really confused by this because as far as I know System.Net.ServicePointManager is per AppDomainp
Negative 2438 pI normally use Java for programming. I have only basic knowledge of C. I am currently using JNI to call the Windows API GetPrivateProfileSection.p  pI understand that I have to write a C function to do this. I am vaguely familiar with how to do this. The problem I face is the returned C string from GetPrivateProfileSection.p  pFrom the Microsoft documentation, I understand that the returned string contains namevalue pairs each separated by a NULL character. The last namevalue pair ends with 2 NULL characters.p  pWhat I want to do is to collect all the individual namevalue strings and put them in an array. I have absolutely no clue as to how to do this with the returned string from GetPrivateProfileSection. I have heard that I need to do something known as pointer arithmetics but I have no knowledge how to do this.p  pCould anyone help me out Thanksp
Negative 2438 pI have 10000 tweets for 5 topics. Assume I know the ground truth the actual topic of each tweet and I group the tweets into 5 documents where each document contain tweets for a particular topic. Then I apply LDA on to the 5 documents with number of topics set to 5. In which case I get good topic words.p  pNow If I dont know the ground truth of tweets, how do I make input documents in a way that LDA will still give me good topic words describing the 5 topics. p  pWhat if I create input documents by randomly selecting a sample of tweets What if this ends up with similar topic mixtures for input documents Should LDA still find good topic words as in the case of 1st paragraphp

Negative 2438 h1Context monitor a lowvolume, intermittent stream from a programh1  pWhen debugging some program, one sometimes have to monitor some output. When output is ascii, no problem, just run in terminal the program itself, or codenccode if it uses a TCP or UDP interface, or codecat devsomedevicecode, or codesocat ...code, whatever. p  h1Need monitor a embinaryem stream realtime... and halfsolutionsh1  pBut sometimes output is binary. One can pipe it into various incantations of codeodcode, codehdcode, e.g. codeod t d1code for decimal numbers, codeod t a1code for augmented ascii display explicit nonprintable characters using printable ones, etc.p  pThe trouble is those buffer the input until they have a complete line to print a line often fitting 16 input characters.  So basically until the program sends 16 character, the monitoring does not show anything. When the stream is low volume andor intermittent, this defeats the purpose of a realtime monitoring.  Many protocols indeed only send a handful of bytes at a time.p  pIt would be nice to tell it ok buffer the input if you wish, but dont wait more than delay x before printing it, even if it wont fill one line.p  pcodeman odcode, codeman hdcode dont mention any related option.p  h1Nonsolutionh1  pHeavy programs like wireshark are not really an option they cover only part of the needs and are not combinable.

It works very well but terminal output is buffered by 16byte chunks and thus delayed a lot.p  h1Summaryh1  pHow do you simply monitor binary output from a program without bytealignmentdependent delay p

Negative 2438 pstrongGoalstrong To send XML using XmlHttpRequest as textxml via POST to PHP file. PHP file then does emmagicem and saves to an XML on the server. A component on an HTML page will be updated with data from the XML.p  pstrongProblemstrong I saw success with this when testing with the php web server, which I initiated in command line with codephp S 127.0.0.18000code but when tested on a MicrosoftIIS server, I got a 405 Method Not Allowed response. When tested on an Apache server, I get a 200 OK response, but server XML file is unchanged.p  pThe Javascript code that sends the XML to PHP is something like thisp  precodevar xHttp if window.XMLHttpRequest      xHttp  new XMLHttpRequest  else      xHttp  new ActiveXObjectMicrosoft.XMLHTTP  xHttp.onreadystatechange  function      if xHttp.readyState  4 ampamp xHttp.status  200          update       xHttp.openPOST, appLocation, true xHttp.setRequestHeaderContentType, applicationxwwwformurlencoded xHttp.setRequestHeaderContentType, textxml xHttp.sendxmlDoc codepre  pIn the above code, xmlDoc is the XML I want to send and appLocation is the location on the server where the PHP file is. update is a function I wrote to update a component on an HTML page with data from the XML file that is saved by PHP. From this, I would know that the XML has successfully changed.p  pThe PHP looks likep  precodexml  filegetcontentsphpinput xmlDoc  simplexmlloadstringxml  Magic  xmlDoc gt asXmlsomefileonserver.xml codepre  pIf I can be successful on either one Apache or Microsoft servers, I would be content.

Negative 2438 pI am trying to add event bus into my project, because this is really great pattern to follow in order to make code more readable and application robust.br I need to listen to the Activity lifecycle methods.br Let me explain why do I need this.br I have activity, inside this activity there is running thread or threads that is tied to this activity exactly to the main UI thread posting some UI changes to the main queue.br When activity is going to be destroyed or paused I need to pause thread and resume it when activity is on screen again.br Of course I can pauseresume thread directly in onDestroy and onStart methods, but there are some another components that also need to listen to activity lifecycle methods.br strongThere are my questions strong   p  ol lipIs it correct use EventBus in this case, or it is better just to do everything in activity lifecycle methods directly without using event bus.  And using event bus in activity lifecycle is ambiguous and incorrect.p  ppublic class ExampleActivity extends Activity p  precodeprivate EventBus bus  EventBus.getDefault  private TextView view  Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          bus.registerthis     bus.postnew OnCreateEventActivity has been born     super.onCreatesavedInstanceState      Override protected void onDestroy       Unregister     bus.postnew OnDestroyEventActivity is going to die     bus.unregisterthis     super.onDestroy  codepre  p  The one advantage I see here is that you havent to add some logic into activity lifecycle methods each time your part of activity needs this. Activity content can be quite complex,also fragments can be used, of course you can use fragment lifecycle methods also. But I wonder if fragment will not be destroyed to the time when activity lifecycle methods will be called, I havent tested this yet. So the main question here what is better to use native hook methods mechanism to do required stuff here or to use event bus. pli lipNext questions are not directly related to main question. Question are about the way in that codeEventBuscodea hrefhttpsgithub.comgreenrobotEventBus relnofollowEventBus Linka library for android is implemented. Why do not make listeners codebus.registerthiscode to implement interface for instance Subscribe with one method codeonEventBusEvent eventcode. And why not to make this method accept some basic class codeBusEventcode. In library implementation reflection is being used each time when event occurs and method codeonEventcode is called. I dont see any advantages in this approach and reflection is quite heavy thing in Java.pli ol  pI would be very grateful for any answers or advice.p
Negative 2438 pSo Im having issues with SDLmixer, and it seems it plays fine on a good amount of mp3s although fine. I noticed that at the beginning of some MP3s theres a small segment of sound corruption, and then it starts playing but on some MP3 files, theres just absolute silence. It doesnt seem to play anything. And MixPlayMusic doesnt seem to return an error, nor does anything else, but it just seems to not make a single sound. Occasionally Ill get a random Access Reading Violation when trying to play those files, but every other time, its just silence.p  pHere is the code that Im using to play the MP3 filep  precodeinclude SDL.h include SDLmixer.h  include ltiostreamgt  bool initLibs      Initialize all SDL subsystems     if SDLInit SDLINITEVERYTHING   1               return false           int flags  MIXINITMP3  MIXINITOGG     ifMixInitflagsflags              return false           Initialize SDLmixer     if MixOpenAudioMIXDEFAULTFREQUENCY, AUDIOS16, 2, 4096   1               return false           If everything initialized fine     return true   int mainint argc, char argv[]      ifinitLibs              stdcout ltlt error loading libraries ltlt stdendl          MixMusic music  MixLoadMUStest.mp3     ifmusic  nullptr              stdcout ltlt error loading music  ltlt MixGetError ltlt stdendl          else              ifMixPlayMusicmusic, 1  1                      stdcout ltlt error playing music  ltlt MixGetError ltlt stdendl                   SDLDelay30000     systemPAUSE     MixHaltMusic     MixFreeMusicmusic     systemPAUSE     return 0  codepre  pI was examining the differences in the MP3 files, and it seems that the only real difference is that the ones with LAME3.99 encoding are the ones that dont seem to work.

Negative 2438 pThis is a kind of difficult question.p  pI know about strongEKFSLAMstrong, which uses a state from previous time to estimate next state as an online filter,  I also know about strongGraphSLAMstrong, which uses all states in past as full SLAM, and represents them as merely whole bunch of nodes and edges, and optimize structure of nodes and eges by minimizing error to estimate better states.p  pNow, I know that there is no meaning in running EKFSLAM with odometry info only, since what EKF does is estimating future state by balancing weight between Odometry info AND Observation of landmark info. so both are needed.p  pMy question is, is it possible to run strongGraphSLAM with only Odometry infostrong and no landmark observation info whatsoever It seems like GraphSLAM can run by gathering all Odometry info state upto current ones and converting them to nodes and edges  just like it does when both Odo and obs are provided, and it can optimize the structure of nodes and edges.

So, here is the same example with different names, making it a bit more specific instead of a general question.  Instead of codeltfruitgtcode try this.

This is why I want to keep my code separate from their data.p  pMy code will first process one user file codemain.xslcode by feeding it an empty document, to produce an XML document containing many codeltfilegtcode elements,  suitable for further transforming.  I can then feed that XML to my applications XSLT code to produce the desired output.p  pIf all the codeltfilegtcode elements are listed in codemain.xslcode then its not a problem, I can just process it down to XML which will contain multiple codeltfilegtcode elements then use an codeltxslforeachgtcode to run through each codeltfilegtcode.p  pThe problem comes when the users want to split their code into multiple files, with one codeltfilegtcode element in each.  They cant use codeltxslincludegtcode to combine them back together again, as my example above hopefully shows.p  pIn other words, I cant see how to structure codemain.xslcode so that it includes both codeone.xslcode and codetwo.xslcode, while keeping both codeltfilegtcode elements intact.  It looks like using named templates is the only way, but this adds an extra level of redundancy I want to avoid.p

Negative 2438 pI have a Java process that allocates a lot of very shortlived objects measured using YourKit to have average age between 1020 ms, and very few long lasting objects, and its function is to accept a TCP message, transform it in some way, and produce to Kafka.p  pThe majority of the objects are created by the Kafka producer that is written in Scala and consequently uses a lot of immutable objects.

Negative 2438 pI searched a lot for this and couldnt find any help. here is the problem I am facing. I am using Spring Integration Inbound and outbound gateways for synchronous request response experience. I see everything work great but not 100 of the times. The inbound gateway on server side when in debug mode seem to be sending the message on the channel that should land up finally in the outbound queue to the client. I can see presend and postsend debug logs of spring integration. The problem is the client still times out. No its not the JMSCorrelationID. Its populated fine and client does get responses most of the times. So I got a Tibco trace log. According to that what I see is that p  precode the client does create a producer on Q1.  client puts a message on Q1  server does pick it up and acknowledge  client creates a consumer with correlation id as selector on Q2 [In successful cases]     server creates a producer on Q2     server produces a message on Q2     client picks up the message from Q2     client acks the message on Q2. [only in success cases above 4 steps]  in 10 seconds client side gateway outbound timeout times out..  producer and consumer on both queues disconnect. codepre  pWe dont see the 4 successful steps above in failure cases.p  pThis tells me that the inbound gateway on server side is missing some property on JMS connections settings making it lazy connect or delayed connect etc. But not able to pinpoint.p  pI am just putting the symptoms of my problems here.p

Negative 2438 pIm still new to using NSURL to get data and seem to have issues whenever trying to use this. In this case I use debug to check all the date coming in in ViewDidload and all the correct data comes in and is split into the arrays I then want to use to build my table view controller. However when we reach the NumberOfRows in section method, all of the arrays seem to have been reset to nil. Ive tried using various combinations of NSURL solutions but none seem to get any further than the one I am using right now which at least shows some data arrriving. Can anyone please let me know if I am making an obvious mistake, or if not give me a reliable piece of code which I should use to perform a simple GET like this.
