Positive 72 pI have a SQL Server database, and I want to move it into the cloud and create a simple browserindependent UI for it. The details arep  ul liThe database is about 2GB in size. It uses SQL Server 2008, however I am happy using any later version. I have successfully restored and tested the database in more recent versions of SQL Server.li liI considered using Amazon RDS or Microsoft SQL Azure for hosting the database. Obviously I have to upload the database into the cloud, I dont mind whether this is by scripting it or restoring a BAK file, and I dont mind what version of SQL Server is provided in the cloud as long as its 2008li liThe interface to the database is via one stored procedure. Information is sent to the stored procedure using an input parameter, then the SP returns a result set of 1 column and several rows.li liThe database is currently hosted on a single computer, and has a simple UI where you type into an entry field and it returns several lines of text. I want to create a similar browserbased interface, eg with an entry field, a submit button to call the stored procedure, and an output area for the SPs response.li liDatabase connections will use SQL Server authenticated logins, as this is the only type of login available to Amazon RDS. The logins will map to a database user that has strongexecstrong permission on the stored procedure, also the database user will be in the strongdenydatareaderstrong and strongdenydatawriterstrong as a security measure.li liMy experience is with SQL Server development, TSQL coding and database security. But beyond basic knowledge of XML  HTML, Im not familiar with the best way of accessing the database from the cloud.li ul  pI welcome anyones ideas or thoughts, or links to suitable articles if this has been asked before.p

Positive 72 pI have a simple web app in ASP.NET MVC which uses Sql CE for the backend database, using EF. Everything works fine, except that Id like to keep a log of impressions for users hitting an api in the app I get enough requests that it crashes the server. Ive tried a couple options which do not perform well enough and I had to disable them. Im keying off a user id in the database which has a unique index on it. p  pin all cases, if the member doesnt exist in the db, a new record is created and saved. p  ul lipin v1, look up member in db, increment an impression counter, save the record back. This was way too slow and crashed the server. pli lipin v2, I simply checked if the record existed and create it. if it exists, I do nothing. This is still too slow, but faster than v1. pli ul  pIm looking into keeping an inmemory db for this next, and store it out to sql ce occasionally. My concern is, will this still not work if I store up 1000 items in a few seconds, and then try to store them in a single update  It feels like sql ce may just not be capable of doing what I need at all, or am I overlooking some simple performance optimization p

Positive 72 pI have a report that consists of a single column tablix with a single row that is grouped. Inside the row are three sub reports. The Header of the report is supposed to display three pieces of information unique to the data that the row is grouped on so the header is unique for each. p  pI attempted to populate the data in the header by having hidden controls in the body that I then referenced in the expressions of the controls in the header. This method didnt work. So I switched to a different possible solution I found which was to populate variables using VB and reference them in the header using codeCode.variableNamecode in the expression. The function to populate the variables is called from a hidden control in the body which passes the data as parameters. p  pThis method worked. However, it only seems to work on my local machine and one of my coworkers machines in BIDS preview. When the report is published to the report server, it runs and everything seems fine, except the header values dont populate.p  pOne of the variables is an integer and the other two are strings. The integer value is initialized to 0 and in the report from the report server it shows the initialized value of 0, but the strings are still blank. This makes me think that the function isnt being called or there might be a scope issue Or it could be something completely different that Im not familiar with. Possibly a configuration issue with the report serverp  pHere is the report a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comGOt6B.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGOt6B.png altScreenshot of the report designerap  pIf you can see the tiny little control about halfway down the report on the left side.

Positive 72 pIm starting a LightSwitch application using an existing SQL database.  When I bring in the tables from the database, all of the nonnull columns in my tables are being interpreted as primary keys and I am not given the option to change this in the property settings.  This is not the case for an SQL view though it will import most of my columns as primary keys, I am given the option to change the key property.p  pThis has become a problem for me because it seems that when I assign one of the tables to a screen, the SQL server is bouncing back an error because lightswitch is trying to sort all of my primary keys, and some of my primary keys are strings and other nonsortable fields.

Then the time stamps on the buffers could be used to sync things up.p  pBut I dont see a way to do this with the V4L2 API spec, nor do I see any examples of v4l2enabled apps gstreamer, ffmpeg, transcode, etc reading both audio and video from a single device.p

Negative 72 pWere starting a new project in Python with a few proprietary algorithms and sensitive bits of logic that wed like to keep private. We also will have a few outsiders select members of the public working on the code. We cannot grant the outsiders access to the small, private bits of code, but wed like a public version to work well enough for them.p  pSay that our project, Foo, has a module, codebarcode, with one function, codegetsaucecode. What really happens in codegetsaucecode is secret, but we want a public version of codegetsaucecode to return an acceptable, albeit incorrect, result.p  pWe also run our own Subversion server so we have total control over who can access what.p  pstrongSymlinksstrongp  pMy first thought was symlinking Instead of codebar.pycode, provide codebarpublic.pycode to everybody and codebarprivate.pycode to internal developers only. Unfortunately, creating symlinks is tedious, manual work  especially when there are really going to be about two dozen of these private modules.p  pMore importantly, it makes management of the Subversion authz file difficult, since for each module we want to protect an exception must be added on the server. Someone might forget to do this and accidentally check in secrets... Then the module is in the repo and we have to rebuild the repository without it and hope that an outsider didnt download it in the meantime.p  pstrongMultiple repositoriesstrongp  pThe next thought was to have two repositoriesp  precodeprivate  trunk      init.py      foo          init.py          bar.py public  trunk      init.py      foo          init.py          bar.py          baz.py          quux.py codepre  pThe idea is that only internal developers will be able to checkout both codeprivatecode and codepubliccode.

Negative 72 pWe have a Java web application and wed like to set up some basic monitoring with a view to expanding this monitoring in future.  Our plan is as followsp  p1 Collect generic information e.g. memory and threads about the virtual machine of the web container that application is running in.p  p2 Monitor the state of the application.  This is rather vague but at the least wed like to see if the web application is still alive and can respond to requests.p  p3 In the future wed like to collect more information that is specific to our application.  Again this is rather vague but you can assume that we might want to make certain statistics collected internally by the application available to the support staff.p  pUsually the web application will be deployed in a Tomcat 5.5 or 6 environment.  A quick bit of searching on the web shows that JMX can be enabled for Tomcat and that JConsole can then be used to connect to the server.  This gives us lots of basic information that solves point 1.  Also, some information is available in the MBeans section for Catalina and drilling down on this I can at least, for example, see how many requests a particular servlet has received.  This is not quite what we want for point 2 but at least gives us some information.  There seems to be quite a lot of information there but its rather difficult to interpret using JConsole.  Perhaps there is a better tool for interpreting the MBeans exposed by Tomcat.p  pFor point 3, it seems, at first glance that we could write our own MBeans and then make these available to something like JConsole.  Personally, this would involve me learning about JMX which Im quite happy to do but I have a concern.   Having looked around I notice that most of the textbooks on the subject havent been updated for several years and the open source tools seem to be languishing without recent updates.  So my main question is a simple one.  What are your opinions on JMX  Does it have a future or is ithas it been superseded by something else  Given we already have our web application but were starting from scratch for the management console, should we choose JMX or is there something more appropriate with a better future ahead of itp  pI ask this question with no personal axe to grind, Im simply interested to hear your opinions and experiences.  Im sure theres no one correct answer but I think an informed discussion would be useful.p  pThanks in advance,p  pAdam.p

Negative 72 pIve inherited a codebase of C dlls that are called via COMinterop or so it has been described.  The C code also uses COM objects internally to perform the basic functionality of the parent application.p  pIm refactoring some of the DRY violations out of the code because finding duplications in 100,000 lines of code across 50 or 60 dlls is inefficient.  Ive come across a use of COM objects in abstract base classes that Id like to standardize a bit, but I havent found a clearly definitive statement anywhere about this particular use of COM objects in C.p  pOur code currently has several base classes that contain COM objects, coded like thisp  precodepublic abstract class SomeBaseClass     protected IComObject comObject     protected virtual void InitializeIComObject comObject           this.comObject  comObject         protected SomeBaseClass    codepre  pTo prevent this.comObject from being set in other than Initialize, Id like to implement these base classes like thisp  precodepublic abstract class SomeBaseClass     private IComObject comObject     protected IComObject ComObject           get  return comObject          protected virtual void InitializeIComObject comObject           this.comObject  comObject         protected SomeBaseClass    codepre  pIn my opinion the second example looks better and gives me more control over the internal comObject.p  pCurrently, the existing derived classes C do not set the base class comObject directly, instead using Initialize, but there is nothing to prevent them from assigning to the base class comObject directly.  I want to prevent the potential future mistake of assigning to comObject outside of Initialize.p  pIs there some reason that the second base class implementation of COM object handling will not work  In my limited testing it seems to work fine, but you guys are smarter than I am.p  pthanksp

Negative 72 pIm working on a silverlight project where users get to create their own Collages.p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pWhen loading a bunch of images by using the BitmapImage class, Silverlight hogs up huge unreasonable amounts of RAM. 150 pictures where single ones fill up at most 4,5mb takes up about 1,6GB of RAMthus ending up throwing memory exceptions.p  pIm loading them through streams, since the user selects their own photos.p  pstrongWhat Im looking forstrongp  pA class, method or some process to eliminate the huge amount of RAM being sucked up.

Ive never created a table in WPF before, and I was expecting there to be an codeItemsSourcecodeproperty to which I could bind, like with a codeListBoxcode.  I want to customize the template for each row, and I want each rows source to be an item in a collection that I pass to the entire table.  So Ill have a codeListltMyClassgtcode instance that would be passed to the table, and each row would show a single codeMyClasscode.  How can I do that  Do I not want to use a codeTablecode within a codeFlowDocumentcode  The reason I wanted to use some kind of tabular format is so that I can have a single row of column names that applies to all the rows.p

Negative 72 pA little briefing first Ive been a Delphi person for years, and been away from C for two years. The last thing Ive done in C  was a mid scale DB app with my own custom DAL. Ie, I had coded my own functions to retrieve data as list, functions to append data and so on. Now I am offered a small to mid scale project using C WinForms and SQL Server, and theres a deadline which is about 2 or 3 weeks. Note that I forgot LINQ syntax and lots of things.p  pNow, which ORM would be easiest and fastest to learn I can cope with not using business abstraction layer if need be, to gain time that is. I need something thatll ease manual labour. Thanks in advance.p
Negative 72 pI have designed a fact table that stores the  facts for a specific date dimension and an action type such as create, update or cancelled. The facts can be create and cancelled only once, but update many times.p  precodemyfact  datekey locationkey actiontypekey codepre  pThis will allow me to get a count for all the updates done, all the new ones created for a period and specify a specific region through the location dimension.p  pNow in addition I also have 2 counts for each fact, i.e. Number of People, Number of Buildings. There is no relation between these. And I would like to query on how many of the facts having a specific count, such as how many have 10 building, how many have 9 etc.p  pWhat would be the best table design for these. Basically I see the following options, but am open to hear better solutions.p  ol lipadd the counts as reference info in the fact table as codepeoplecountcode and codebuildingcountcodepli lipadd a dimension for each of these that stores the valid options, i.e. codepeople dimensioncode that stores a codekeycode and a count and codebuilding dimensioncode that stores a codekeycode and a count. The main fact will have a codepeoplekeycode and a codebuildingkeycodepli lipadd one dimension for the count these is used for both people and building counts, i.e. codecount dimensioncode that stores a codekeycode and a generic count.

Negative 72 pI have been tasked with a project where I am to add a new application and have it within an older application web applications.  This is an internal application and management decided that they want it wrapped in this older app.  The older application is a ASP.net web app using the 3.5 framework.p  pMy original plan was to use jQuery and Web Services using JSON and AJAX.  My teammate on the project really wants to use Entity Framework 4.0.  As we may be sharing the same look and feel the data is a different database altogether.p  pAfter several attempts yesterday, we found some issues.  We created a project inside the original solution that targets the 4.0 framework.  I created a WebService on the project, but when I tried to call the webservice from the 3.5 project I didnt get an error but I didnt get the return string.  I was watching on Firebug and did not see the GET call either.p  pMy teammate did a little more research and found out about the crossdomain issue and jQuery, so it seems that we are limited with the Entity Framework 3.5 and remaining on the .net Framework 3.5.  We did try changing the dataType to jsonp but calling the WebService still didnt work.p  pHowever, I was wondering, really management wants the project wrapped inside this other project for consistency sake navigation, design and so forth.  Is there a way to have the 3.5 project display our code that is being generated from the 4.0 project a totally different solution and probably a different server  Im thinking the way the iFrame used to work but I dont want to use an iFrame at all.p

Negative 72 pI have a clientside app that downloads a Nullsoft installer from the server and runs the installer as an external process with verb set to runas. Nullsoft installer also has a line in the script that requests elevated privileges. On Windows 7, this works sometimes  Windows displays the UAC dialog, clicking ok allows the installer to run. But other times, the UAC dialog never shows up and as a result the installer never launches. If I manually doubleclick the same installer, it always works, i.e. the UAC dialog shows up, etc. The most confusing part is this behavior being inconsistent, on the same machine with the exact same UAC settings this works sometimes and hangs the other times. I have tried different UAC levels too, still it is hitormiss. Any ideasp

Negative 72 pI am making an iFrame application for Facebook using the Facebook C SDK.

The userid is 0. When opening up FireBug the response from the request is Unsupported get request. I suspect this has something to do with the face that the AJAX request is using a different session for the call and that session is not authenticated. I was wondering if there is any way to get around this I known I could make the page I am requesting reauthenticate but that would mean I would have to reauth for every request which does not seem efficient.

Negative 72 pPlease forgive my attempts at necromancy, but I actually need to write some code for 16bit DOS . I have to verify that a piece of software executes correctly when built for a 16bit platform, and I discovered that our XP workstations can actually run 16bit DOS apps, which makes it possible to use the existing batch test system. p  pIn any case, the software consists of one library and one database. Smaller databases up to 150kB can either be defined as a static global array or read from file to a buffer allocated with codehalloccode, so I am fairly confident that the library and test tool is built correctly.p  pHowever, we also have some larger databases to test, up to 1.8Mb. This is too large to allocate normally, so I wrote a small support library to allocate XMS memory. With this, I can successfully allocate, use i.e. write and read data and free up to 16Mb of data in a small toy program. However, when using the XMS facilities in the real application, I get the following errorp  precodeThe NTVDM CPU has encountered an illegal instruction.

E.G. encrypting the DB protects me in the situation where the DB is compromised but not the entire server. Other similar mitigating steps would be much appreciated.p

Negative 72 pMaven has a version management system that picks the highest version of a library if multiple versions are referenced. For example if a pom A refers to a version 1.1 and and pom B to 1.2, then a pom C referring to both A and B will use the highest version 1.2.p  pThis approach assumes that 1.2 is 100 backwards compatible with 1.1 and this is a good and required approach. However, at certain times in the lifecycle of libraries it is wise to clean up shop. For me any major changes in the API means increasing the major version, so a 2.0 does not need to be 100 backwards compatible to the latest 1.x. Fine.p  pMaven, however, does not really care and if pom B would be upgraded from 1.2 to 2.0, Maven would then use 2.0, but pom A cannot work with that version.p  pstrongHow to tell Maven that a version is no longer backwards compatiblestrongp  pIve tried specifying excluding ranges, so A refers [1.1,1.999 and B refers [2.0,2.999. However, Maven still solves the maximum version number 2.0.p

Negative 72 pBelow is a class having the method SomeMethod that illustrates my problem.p  precodeclass SomeClass      AutoResetEvent theEvent  new AutoResetEventfalse      more member declarations      public void SomeMethod               some code         theEvent.WaitOne          more code       codepre  pThe method is designed to be threadsafe and will be called in different threads. Now my question is how is it possible to unblock all threads that have called the WaitOne method on the theEvent object at any point of time This requirement frequently arises in my design because I need to be able to gracefully stop and start my multithreaded program. It seems to me that its fairly simple to start a multithreaded program, but tricky to stop one.p  pHeres what I have tried so far which apparently works. But is this the standard approachp  precodepublic void UnblockAll      do              theEvent.Set      while theEvent.WaitOne0  codepre  pThe UnblockAll method is a member of the SomeClass class. The technique used here is based on the MSDN documentation of the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarycc18990728VS.9629.aspx relnofollowWaitOne methoda. I am quoting the relevant part of the documentation belowp  blockquote   pIf millisecondsTimeout is zero, the method does not block. It tests the state of the wait handle and returns immediately. p blockquote  pIn the do..while loop, I call the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.threading.eventwaithandle.set28VS.9029.aspx relnofollowSet methoda. This releases a single thread that may have blocked due to a call to the WaitOne method coded inside the SomeMethod method. Next I test the state of the theEvent object just to know whether its signalled. This test is done by calling the overloaded version of the WaitOne method that takes a time out parameter. The argument which I use when I call the WaitOne method is zero, which as per the documentation results in the call returning immediately with a boolean value. If the return value is true, then the theEvent object emwasem in a signalled state. If there was at least a single thread blocked on the call to the WaitOne method in the SomeMethod method, the call to the Set method coded inside the UnblockAll method would unblock it. Consequently the call to the WaitOne method at the end of the do..while statement in the UnblockAll method would return false. The return value is true only if there were no threads blocked.p  pIs the above reasoning right and if its right, is the technique a standard way to deal with my problem I am trying to use the solution primarily on the .net compactframework 2.0 platform.p

Im developing a small C console application where I need to do the same thing. I tried with ncurses, which is the obvious choice, but it doesnt support ANSI escape sequences for colors httpasciitable.comansiescapesequences.php and what Im essentially doing is forkexec 4 bash shells in the same tty, which is a piece of cake in ncurses, but, with no colors and lots of failed escape sequences that looks like garbage. Methods like printf and stdcout, works perfectly with the colors but are useless in this case as ncurses relies in its own functions to keep things in place.p  pBefore suggesting parsing the escape sequences into ncurses to colorize the output with native attributes of the library, keep in mind that is too much work and there should be a more elegant way to deal with it like GNU Screen doesp  pSo, any ideas of how to work it outp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 72 pI have articles and keywords stored inside MySQL. The site will preprocess the new articles to find how many matching keywords there are and then update a table which stores the relevant keywords related to the article. This will then be used on the frontend by highlighting keywords within the article and will link users to articles with the same matching keywords.p  pMy concern here is how to do this processing efficiently. My idea is when processing new articles, it finds the ngrams of the text up to 3 or 4gram and then search each against the keywords table in the MySQL database. This may end up being a slow mess, I havent tried. But maybe Im approaching this the wrong wayp  pAny resources on how to do this efficiently would be awesome. Language used here is primarily PHP.p

Negative 72 pI  have been looking for this pattern for some time but still did not get very good way of representing this . p  pConsider a GUI design which needs to show attributes of an object based on version , these versions specify which attributes makes sense to a client . say the client has details of supported versions  p  pThe GUI layout need to change based on the version of this object . For example for certain versions we want to show additional menus etc. For some we want to change the ordering of the attributes etc. p  pFor the above condition is there any pattern which defines how to represent the classes p  pCurrently the way we do is to have a check for versioning for these but its getting out of control , so i am looking for a solution which allows us to share the common code and also keep the version specific code separate so that we can maintain it . And changes to a version localized .p

This allowed me to use ...presentPopoverFromBarButtonItem...p  pSo I tried the code in the second answer in the aforementioned question, and got a result that was better. The popover points right to the button as I wanted, but if the orientation of the device is not portrait with the button on the bottom, the popover displays with the wrong orientationp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTTVGy.png altPopover with wrong orientationp  pFinally, I will point out that I have other bar button items elsewhere in the program that are not in UIInputAccessoryViews that come up properly and without issue. It only seems to be happening form the input accessory view.p  pThis just in Hiding and showing the keyboard seems to make this work a bit better. Looking at the frame CGRect data for the button, it doesnt change between rotations unless its hidden and brought back. Is this a bugp  pSo.. my question is this what is the preferred, bestpractices way of presenting a popover from a bar button item embedded in a ui accessory viewp  pThank you very much.p

Negative 72 pIf you need to recursively traverse a directory tree, there are two ways to do itp  ol lipBuild up pathnames of increasing length as you go, ......... etc.pli lipUse chdir to step down into each directory as you come to it, so you are never dealing with pathnames longer than two components.pli ol  pThe first method strikes me as more obvious, and might be more robust against untoward events like something being unmounted while you are halfway through it.

Negative 72 pIm currently doing work on an optimisation algorithm that requires real numbers Java doubles, to be specific be converted into bit strings again, to be specific an ordered collection of Java booleans and back again. The scheme used is that the first bit indicates whether the value lies in the first or second half of the range the second bit subdivides the halves again, and so on.p  pThe selfmade algorithm Im using to do this works fine when working with ranges that have a specified upper and lower value, however things get problematic when I try to use the full range of the Java codedoublecode I think, although Im not sure, that the problem is related to the fact that codeDouble.MAXVALUE  1.0  Double.MAXVALUE gt Double.MAXVALUEcode. That, however, isnt my question today. Im sure Im not the first one to try to use a number representation like this, so Im sure the answers to my problems are out there on the Interwebs Im just not sure what to search for. What do you call such a representation of real numbersp  hr  p Obviously, the number of bits used places a limit on the precision Im aware of and accept this.p

As I realize the way i have it setup now the Galleria  iframe is at 420px h x 820px w, which looks good on the screen im working on now 1280x800, but if a user had a higher screen resolution, it would look too small, and with no ability to fullscreen the galleria, its a problem.p  pso I have a couple questions..p  ol lipIs there anyway to make the Galleria fullscreen not only in the iframe but in the whole browser  pli lipIs there anyway to either resize the iframe  content Galleria to reflect a users screen resolution   pli ol  pIf theres a way to fullscreen that would be the best option because someone with a higher resolution screen would just be able to hit that.  if not, hopefully the other option is possible. p

Negative 72 pI am using WCF Data Services v2 and my Entity Model has grown quite a bit over time, i.e. over 100 entities.  There is quite a bit of navigation that is possible.  The client UIs are LOB applications with data entry and search screens.  The search forms bring back collections of data and the data entry forms usually comprise of ONE entity that has the majority of the properties but with MANY navigation properties due to comboboxes needed to display these individual collections e.g. an Employee data entry form with ComboBoxes displaying a State list or Department list.  I lazy load the combobox data FYI.  p  pThe issue I am having is that if I want to populate a simple list via a ComboBox, the payload is HUMONGOUS  Using fiddler, e.g., the XML generated has a bunch of clutter that I dont really NEED just to populate this ComboBox.  p  pHere is an example of ONE record being brought back of type Employee.  p  precode      ltxml version1.0 encodingutf8 standaloneyesgt ltfeed xmlbasehttplocalhostHumanResourcesService.svc xmlnsdhttpschemas.microsoft.comado200708dataservices xmlnsmhttpschemas.microsoft.comado200708dataservicesmetadata xmlnshttpwww.w3.org2005Atomgt   lttitle typetextgtEmployeeslttitlegt   ltidgthttplocalhostHumanResourcesService.svcEmployeesltidgt   ltupdatedgt20111109T234101Zltupdatedgt   ltlink relself titleEmployees hrefEmployees gt   ltentrygt     ltidgthttplocalhostHumanResourcesService.svcEmployees54924ltidgt     lttitle typetextgtlttitlegt     ltupdatedgt20111109T234101Zltupdatedgt     ltauthorgt       ltname gt     ltauthorgt     ltlink reledit titleEmployee hrefEmployees54924 gt     ltlink relhttpschemas.microsoft.comado200708dataservicesrelatedEmployeeTypes typeapplicationatomxmltypefeed titleEmployeeTypes hrefEmployees54924EmployeeTypes gt      ltlink relhttpschemas.microsoft.comado200708dataservicesrelatedLocations typeapplicationatomxmltypefeed titleLocations hrefEmployees54924Locations gt     ltlink relhttpschemas.microsoft.comado200708dataservicesrelatedBuildings typeapplicationatomxmltypefeed titleBuildings hrefEmployees54924Buildings gt     ltlink relhttpschemas.microsoft.comado200708dataservicesrelatedManagers typeapplicationatomxmltypefeed titleManagers hrefEmployees54924Managers gt     ltlink relhttpschemas.microsoft.comado200708dataservicesrelatedAssignments typeapplicationatomxmltypefeed titleAssignments hrefEmployees54924Assignments gt            MANY MORE LINKS  REMOVED FOR BREVITY                   ltlink relhttpschemas.microsoft.comado200708dataservicesrelatedxxx typeapplicationatomxmltypeentry titlexxx hrefEmployees54924xxx gt     ltlink relhttpschemas.microsoft.comado200708dataservicesrelatedyyy typeapplicationatomxmltypeentry titleyyy hrefEmployees54924yyy gt     ltlink relhttpschemas.microsoft.comado200708dataservicesrelatedzzz typeapplicationatomxmltypeentry titlezzz hrefEmployees54924zzz gt     ltcategory termxxx.HumanResources.Employee schemehttpschemas.microsoft.comado200708dataservicesscheme gt     ltcontent typeapplicationxmlgt       ltmpropertiesgt         ltdEmpNo mtypeEdm.Stringgt54924ltdEmpNogt         ltdFirstName mtypeEdm.StringgtJohnltdFirstNamegt         ltdLastName mtypeEdm.StringgtHughesltdLastNamegt         ltdMiddleName mtypeEdm.StringgtMichaelltdMiddleNamegt         ltdSalary mtypeEdm.Decimalgt20000ltdSalarygt         ltdNotes mtypeEdm.StringgtAnything...ltdNotesgt         ltdPrimaryPhone mtypeEdm.Stringgt9848754545ltdPrimaryPhonegt         ltdStartDate mtypeEdm.DateTimegt19770201T000000ltdStartDategt         ltdEndDate mtypeEdm.DateTimegt19951231T000000ltdEndDategt                    MANY MORE PROPERTIES  REMOVED FOR BREVITY                   ltdAnotherFieldX mtypeEdm.Double mnulltrue gt       ltmpropertiesgt     ltcontentgt   ltentrygt ltfeedgt   codepre  pAs you can see, I dont need all that junk like those LINKS and this is just ONE entity.

Negative 72 pI have been reading about entity framework over the past couple of days and have managed to get a fair idea of using it but I still have a couple of questions some of which might seem a bit too basic. For perspective I am using entity framework 4.0 in an asp.net web application.If you can answer any of the questions please go ahead.p  ol lipWhat advantage do I get by using POCO templates. I understand that if I wish to get persistence ignorance and keep my Entities clear of any information related to storage POCO entities are the way to go. Also I could switch from Entity framework to say NHibernate with relative ease when using POCO entities Apart from loose coupling is there any significant reason for me to go towards POCO entities. Also if I do use POCO do I end up losing anything. I still get change tracking and lazy loading with the help of proxiespli lipIs it normal practice to use the Entities of the EF model as Data transfer Objects or Business Objects. i.e for example I have a separate class library for my entity model.Supposing I am using MVP , where I want a list of Employees in a company. The presenter would request my business logic functions which would query the entity model for the list of Employees and return the list of entities to the presenter. In this case my presenter would need to have a reference to the EF model. Is this the correct way In the case of my asp.net web applciation it shouldnt be a problem but if I am using web services how does this work Is this the reason to go towards POCO entitiespli lipSupposing The Employee entity has a navigation property to a company table. If I use and wrap the data context in an using block , and try to access the navigation property in the BL I am assuming I would get an exception. Would I also get an exception if I turned off lazyloading and used the include linq query to get the entity On a previous post someone recommended I use an context per request implying that the context remains active even when I am in the BL. I am assuming I would still need to detach the object and attach it to the context on my next request if I wish to persist any changes I make or Instead should I just query for the object again with the new context and update it pli lipThis question has more to do with organizing filesbest practices and is a followup to a question i posted earlier. When I am using separate files based on entities to organize my data access layer, what is the best practice to organize my queries involving joins between multiple tables. I am still a bit hazy on organization. Have tried searching online but havent had much help. pli ol

Negative 72 pAfter reading about dynamic class loading that is, loading a .class file from disk I am getting a bit worried.p  pLets say I have a file called codeMyClass.classcode that contains the class codea.b.c.MyClasscode. Assuming I now decide to move the file to codeCcodemy root folder in Windows, Id like to dynamically load this class. Is that possible, at all From what I understood it seems codeMyClasscode path would always have to be of the form codeabc.MyClasscode. p  pThus, the following bit of code doesnt seem to workp  precodeURL[] urls  new URL[]  new FileC.toURL  URLClassLoader classLoader  new URLClassLoaderurls Classltgt targetClass  classLoader.loadClassa.b.c.MyClass codepre  pForcing us to put a code.classcode file in a directory structure that reflects its full internal name is insane, IMO. Am I missing somethingp  pA possible implication of this fact would be that if I decide to copy a couple of code.classcode files into a temporary directory so I can perform some awesome wizardry over them, Ill have to replicate all their dirty paths in that same temporary directory, which is awkward, at best.p

Negative 72 pToday I was reading code from some very popular numerical libraries written in FORTRAN 77 such as QUADPACK a hrefhttpwww.netlib.orgquadpackchanges relnofollowlast updated in 1987a, and I was wondering if there is any reason not to rewrite those libraries in Fortran 90 apart from the big amount of work it would pose, given the great improvements Fortran 90 brought to the language, including freeform source, better control structures so GO TO could be forgotten, vectorization, interfaces and so on.p  pIs it because FORTRAN 77 compilers produce more optimized code, maybe it is better for parallel execution Notice that Im not even talking about Fortran 2003 for example, which is emonlyem 8 years old Im talking about Fortran 90, so I assume it has enough widespread and the compilers are ready.

Negative 72 pIve been googling for ages now, but cannot find an answer to the problem Im facing. Heres the situationp  pI have a .Net web service not a wcf service, but an old fashioned web service, that has a web method in it returning, say, an object of type X.p  pNow when i create a service reference to this web service from a different .Net project, visual studio will generate a proxy class in the reference.vb, and the return type of the web method in this class is that proxy class say, type Y instead of type X.p  pThe thing is, type X is a type that is declared in an external reference that exists in both ends of the web method. Is there ANY way the service itself should stay a web service, but I dont care if the reference is a service reference or a web reference i can make visual studio understand that there is no need to create a proxy class and it can use the existing type for the return type of the methodp  pI know that service references can automatically map types you can set these settings when creating the service reference. However, this only seems to work when creating a service reference to a wcf service, not to a normal .net web servicep  pUpdate p  pIt seems i need to somehow make visual studio match the namespaces of the types. John Saunders hinted me to the xmltype attribute i can use to specify the full namespace of the type. I will try if this works.p  pI also thought about how visual studio matches the classes. It seems there is no info about namespaces in the wsdl of the web service anywhere assuming studio uses the wsdl as input for generating the reference so how can studio match the typesp  pUpdate2 Ive tried to use the xmltype to map the namespace. I wasnt sure what namespace to use the uri kind of the actual ClrNamespace so i tried both. Using the  uri namespace I was able to create a namespace mapping in the svcmap, but this caused the code in the reference.vb file to be generated inside an extra namespace instead of making VS want to map the type. Any new ideas Can this really be this hardp

Negative 72 pIm creating a model called Configuration and I have the following code and I want to make it more dynamic by using metaprogramming.p  pIn a table on the database for Configuration model I have the following data.p  precode variablename as string       value in text                              companyname                  MyCompany welcometext                  Welcome to MyCompanys App emailordertext              Youve just created an account with MyCompany. yearsince                    2012   class Configuration  lt ActiveRecordBase      nothing here yet  end   codepre  pCurrently, the only way to access the companyname is to do the following in rails consolep  precodeconfigurationcompanyname  Configuration.findbyvariablenamecompanyname configurationcompanyname.companyname  gt MyCompany codepre  pI think this is an unacceptable way to do things. First, it will access the database everytime someone checks for the companys name. I think if I could load it when the app starts and doesnt have to access it again because its in the memory, then it would be better. How can I do something more dynamic so I could access the value MyCompany like this.p  precodeConfiguration.companyname  gt MyCompany codepre  pThe reason to do this is to give allow fast customization of the application.  p

Negative 72 pIm building an internal intranet MVC3 application using Windows Authentication and a custom role provider.  The authentication and role provider work okay, as long as the the user has the role requested.p  pFor example, I have a codeUserContollercode which allows the user of the application to manage user accounts within the application.  Obviously i want to restrict access to this controller.p  pIf I do thisp  precode[Authorize] public class UserController  Controller      ...  codepre  pthen the Windows Authentication works fine, and the user is transparently logged in.  However, I want to restrict the controller to a specific group of users.  So I do thisp  precode[AuthorizeRolesUserAdmin] public class UserController  Controller      ...  codepre  pIf the list of roles returned by my role provider includes UserAdmin, then everything is fine and the user gets access to the controller.p  pHowever, if the user is not in the role then the browser tested on IE8 and FF10 prompts for credentials.  If that is cancelled then the server returns a 401 error page.p  pSo my question after all of that is, how do I handle the situation where the user is not in the requested role, and return him to the applications home action, or some other action to provide a userfriendly messagep

Negative 72 pThis has been asked a lot, but Im after more specific answers.p  pIm designingdeveloping a suite of applications that are dependent on communicating with a agent and a manager. They will be communicating commands from manager to agent and statistics agent to manager. At the moment, this suite of applications will only run on the Windows platform, but eventually should scale out to other systems. Some places where this application would be used might not want to install a great load of applications across their systems, and some might not want the manager side sitting there sucking up juice analysis and therefore might want it in the cloud. p  pSo, I know that I can use .Net TCP sockets, which seems to have good raw performance and allows me a great deal of flexibility.p  pI also know that I could use Windows Communication Foundation, which seems like naturally a better choice.p  pBut, seeing as Im sending commands and receiving statistics, I could just use Powershell to connect remotely and use the plethora of commands available from what would be the server, ruling out writing a client application full stop.p  pBearing in mind that these applications client especially should just sit there, be quiet, do their job and not interfere with general operations, which would you suggest to be better p  pIf you need more clarification Ill be happy to do sop  pThanks.p

Negative 72 pIm just doing some assembly for fun on MacOS X and at the moment am just trying to map a file into memory using the mmap system call, however im a bit puzzled at the moment. Heres the code snippetp  precodemovq 0x20000c5, rax               mmap syscall xorq rsi,rsi                       movq rcx,rdi                      size of the file is in rcx movq 0x1,rdx                      read only movq 0x1,r10                      shared movq finputrip,r8               file descriptor xorq r9,r9                        no offset syscall codepre  pThis does not produce an error in the sense that the carryflag is set however it returns 0 in rax where I thought it should actually return a pointer to the memory it has mapped the file to. Ive ofcourse tried checking the obvious things and there is nothing wrong with the filesize or the file descriptor. I bet theres something obvious Im missing here but I just cant see it at the moment. Would be most thankful for any help.p
Negative 72 pIm building an application which will consist of few tabbed panels. On each of them, Id like to put sets of components separated from each other by borders. It would look likep  precode Titled Border 1   [JTextField] [JComboBox] [JTextField] [JComboBox]     Titled Border 2   [JTextField] [JComboBox] [JTextField] [JComboBox]    ... and so forth. codepre  pWhen I tried to simply add new border, Titled Border 2, to the panel, it was added and covered the first one leaving components on top though. In some examples I saw many JPanels defined within one frame and each panel had its own border. It might work in my case but how to add these panels to be displayed within one tabp  pOne of Oracles tutorials shows exactly a tabbed pane with demo of many kinds of borders. When I tried to edit it and put a component there, it appeared between two borders instead of being surrounded. And it was another option that was unsuccessful for me.p  pSecond thing is, I dont use any layout manager, components positions are fixed and honestly I would keep this setting. Or maybe you recommend using any layout manager in this specific casep  pWould you have any hints on how to solve this problemp  pEdit it seems Im not allowed yet to attach a screenshot, but heres the part of code taking care of displaying the bordersp  precode    lenMicro  new JPanel     lenMicro.setLayoutnull      bGreyLine  BorderFactory.createLineBorderColor.GRAY, 1, true     bTitled1  BorderFactory.createTitledBorderbGreyLine, Length 12, TitledBorder.LEFT, TitledBorder.TOP     lenMicro.setBorderbTitled1     bTitled2  BorderFactory.createTitledBorderbGreyLine, Length 22, TitledBorder.LEFT, TitledBorder.TOP     lenMicro.setBorderbTitled2  codepre  pThe border titled Length 22 is displayed when the last two lines are uncommented.p

Negative 72 pI am trying to pull HTML data out of a codeWebViewcode.  Ive seen this done a thousand times and Ive even gotten it to work myself.  However, my new project leads to an interesting situation I need to login to a site through a codeWebViewcode and emthenem pull the HTML.  Obviously, the codeSocketcode method doesnt work, because in order for a webpage to be returned you need the cookie for authentication.  Ive also tried the codeJavascriptInterfacecode trick, but that didnt work either.  Im thinking the best way to achieve this is to use codeHttpGetcode with codeCookieManagercode  Does anyone know how I can get raw HTML code from a codeWebViewcode with an auth cookie  Thanksp  pEDIT I did some JS injection and didnt see any cookies... so it might not be a cookie issue  But the links that you get redirected to are generic, like codemainPagea1code and codeinfoPagecode.

Negative 72 pI have a emWeb Forms Applicationem under ASP.NET 4.0 emCem. Well I started thinking about applying pages routing in order to mask my internal resource organization, so I asked in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12636087howtospecifyurlmappingsinaspnet40whenparametersareinvolvedThis Questiona and accepted the answer.p  h2A little backgroundh2  pMy problem is that, when applying a route, the considered page will be routed correctly, meaning that I reach the page through a different path logical and not physical, but images, styles and external resources are not rendered correctly not at all.p  pBut lets be more detailed.

Normally, to view my blog I always did codehttplocalhostMyWebSiteBlog.aspxcode and my blog posts all showed. I did that again and no problem. Then I try typing codehttplocalhostMyWebSiteblogpostscode and the page is correctly routed. But there is a problem. The browser does not load images and styles. p  h3I suspect...h3  pIt is like it tries to get images and style links starting from the url that I provided, but being that a logical one, it will fail The page looks with the content, and the content is all there, but when it comes to images, css stuff and everything that is linked from somewhere outside the page itself, well it is not loaded by the browser.p  pI wanted to inspect my html, but it is not strange, it is simply as it normally is even when I did not apply routing.

Negative 72 pI am subclassing a codeUIViewControllercode and instantiating a codeUIScrollViewcode in its view which has a height of 480 and a width of 640 2x the regular width.

Negative 72 pI was trying to create an attribute that implies code[Serializable]code but I noticed that this codeSerializableAttributecode class is sealed.p  pIn Java it was possible to create an interface say, codeMyInterfacecode that is inherited from codeSerializablecode interface and so all the subclasses of codeMyInterfacecode would also be serializable, even its subsub classes would be so.p  pLets say I am creating an ORM and I want customers to annotate their entity classes as code[DatabaseEntity]code but in order to make sure that entities are serializable, I also need to ask them to attribute their classes with extra code[Serializable]code which does not look quite compact and neat.p  pI am wondering why codeSerializableAttributecode class is strongcodesealedcodestrong and why has strongcodeInheritedfalsecodestrong which implies that subclasses of serializable class will not be serializable unless it is explicitly stated. What motives are behind these design choices p
Negative 72 pi am using the node.js as client to jms topic.There are two protocols available to make the connection on Topic. Theses are Stomp and AMQP. I am read brief about them at a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiAdvancedMessageQueuingProtocolhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiAdvancedMessageQueuingProtocola and a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiStreamingTextOrientedMessagingProtocolhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiStreamingTextOrientedMessagingProtocola. Both seems to be  wire level protocol i.e     data that is sent across the network as a stream of octets.I do not find any   concrete reason which one should be preferred. If someone can shed light on it, it would be helpful.p  pAnother point is both the protocol takes pride in stating them as interoprable. Does the interoperable term means that if someone  want to take off specific message broker implementation say apache active MQ and instead want to plugin Websphere MQ , transition  will be smoothprovided both support AMQPSTOMP or any other wire levl protocolp

Negative 72 pTrying to access the analyzedtokenized text in my ElasticSearch documents.p  pI know you can use the a hrefhttpwww.elasticsearch.orgguidereferenceapiadminindicesanalyze.htmlAnalyze APIa to analyze arbitrary text according your analysis modules.

Negative 72 pI am working on solving this problemp  pProfessor Gaedel has written a program that he claims implements Dijkstras algorithm. The program produces v.d and v. for each vertex v in V. Give an O.V  Etime algorithm to check the output of the professors program. It should determine whether the d and  attributes match those of some shortestpaths tree. You may assume that all edge weights are nonnegative.p  pv.d is the shortest distance from starting node to v. v. is vs predecessor in the shortest path from starting node to vp  pMy idea is For every vertex i, compare i.d with i..d.  If is predecessor has a larger d value then we cannot have a shortestpath tree.p  pI believe this can check if the professors output is not a shortestpath tree, but I dont think it can confirm that the output is a shortestpath tree.  I cannot think of a way to do this without more information.p  pAm I on the right trackp

Negative 72 pIm building the following project website a hrefhttphpsfo.bitbucket.org relnofollowhttphpsfo.bitbucket.orga and would like to add the twitter widget as part of the navigation bar to cover the need for announcements, project updates, whats new etc. While adding the twitter widget I bump into two issues. p  pThe first issue is that I cant find the way to vertically align the widget correctly even when I inline the style like this codeltli styleverticalalign middlegtcode, what shall I do here to get the correct middle vertical alignment The second issue is that upon loading, the style is shown incorrectly and then it loads the correct button style on the fly, you can see this unwanted effect by refreshing the page. How can I avoid thisp  pUPDATE the second issue seems to be related to remotely loading the js file from the twitter server. I think I could solve this by simply inlining the file into my project website.p

Negative 72 pIm writing application for generating huge graphs and displaying them. First iv try WPF with sharpGL but performance was horrible. Then i tried XNA and it was better. But there i have lack of interface. I can try use XNA in WinForms maybe, but it costs performance. For now its my only option.  So iv tried draw graph on XNA. For now, i approach this by primitives drawing, but im not quite satisfied with performance. Im drawing two graphs on scene. First have 10k vertices and about 30k edges, second have 20k vertices and 30k edges.Im drawing edges like thisp  precode    GraphicsDevice.DrawUserPrimitivesltVertexPositionColorgtPrimitiveType.LineList, verticesDelanuay, 0, Graph.DelaunayEdges.Count     GraphicsDevice.DrawUserPrimitivesltVertexPositionColorgtPrimitiveType.LineList, verticesVoronoi, 0, Graph.VoronoiEdges.Count codepre  pbut for every vertex i want to draw some kind of square. For now, im drawing four triangles for every vertex. Like thisp  precodegraphics.GraphicsDevice.DrawUserIndexedPrimitivesPrimitiveType.TriangleList, vertices, 0, vertices.Length, indices, 0, intCircleStep, VertexPositionColor.VertexDeclaration codepre  pFor all this drawing i want to have camera, which can zoom in, out and move. I did this, by basicEffect.View and passing proper Matrix.p  pFor those data i have 10  15 fps. Is it a normal performance or can i do something to speed things up p  pI want to know what is the fastest way for draw something like this and is it a better way to have interface and graphical environment in one than WinForm  XNAp
Negative 72 pI am creating an application in my free time that is a stock charting application. It has an Adapter that works in a background thread and does long running data requests and then returns the data request to the window that made the call.p  pMy application can have multiple windows open that are instances of the WPF ChartWindow I have setup, where I run into problem I have been searching and pulling hair out on is when when I get multiple windows involved.p  pThe problem Im running into is that I open two chart windows, make data request on Chart A the data does in fact return to chart A Great.

When I create some attributes with an codeoptions[myoptions]code expression, I always get an codeIllegalStateExceptioncode in my template JSP because a list attribute with the name codemyoptionscode is missing, even though I defined this list attribute. My code is as followsp  h2tiles.xmlh2  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8 gt ltDOCTYPE tilesdefinitions PUBLIC        Apache Software FoundationDTD Tiles Configuration 3.0EN        httptiles.apache.orgdtdstilesconfig30.dtdgt  lttilesdefinitionsgt      ltdefinition nameWILDCARD templateWEBINFviewtemplate.jspgt         ltputattribute namemeta valueWEBINFviewoptions[folder]meta.jsp gt         ltputattribute nameheader valueWEBINFviewoptions[folder]header.jsp gt         ltputattribute namebody valueWEBINFviewoptions[folder]2.jsp gt         ltputattribute namefooter valueWEBINFviewoptions[folder]footer.jsp gt          ltputlistattribute namefoldergt             ltaddlistattributegt                 ltaddattribute value1 gt                 ltaddattribute valuecommon gt             ltaddlistattributegt         ltputlistattributegt     ltdefinitiongt lttilesdefinitionsgt codepre  h2template.jsph2  precodelt page languagejava pageEncodingUTF8     contentTypetexthtml charsetutf8 trimDirectiveWhitespacestruegt lt taglib prefixtiles urihttptiles.apache.orgtagstilesgt lt taglib prefixfmt urihttpjava.sun.comjspjstlfmtgt  lthtmlgt ltheadgt lttitlegtdynamicTitle  ltfmtmessage keycommon.siteName gtlttitlegt lttilesinsertAttribute namemeta gt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltdiv idheadergt         lttilesinsertAttribute nameheader gt     ltdivgt     ltdiv idbodygt         lttilesinsertAttribute namebody gt     ltdivgt     ltdiv idfootergt         lttilesinsertAttribute namefooter gt     ltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pI tried several solutions with no result. My trials were as follows 1. Use codelttilesimportAttribute namefoldergtcode in my JSP. Absolutely no difference 2. Use codelttilesinsertAttribute namefoldergtcode in my JSP. I got an exception since attribute was not a string. 3. Define attribute in JSP using codelttilesputListAttribute namefoldergtFULLDEFINITIONHERElttilesputListAttributegtcode no difference at all.p  pIve referred to the article mentioned above, and a hrefhttptiles.apache.orgframeworkindex.html relnofollowtiles documentationa specifically the a hrefhttptiles.apache.orgframeworkapidocsorgapachetilesextrasrendererOptionsRenderer.html relnofollowOptionsRenderer documentationa with no use. Can anybody tell me what Im doing wrong here I believe that this is not related to spring MVC.p

Negative 72 pIn order to slake my thirst for C knowledge, on two linux boxes connected to my home network, Im writing kind of a skeleton telnet that codesendcodes and coderecvcodes strings just for some experience with sockets and threads.

Negative 72 pIm starting an activity from a broadcastreceiver that turns the screen on and dismisses the lockscreenby using windowmanager flags. This part is working as planned, the activity starts.

This works as planned on my Galaxy S2, but on my Nexus 7 and my Galaxy Note 2 the YouTube video doesnt start and gives me a message in the YouTubePlayerView showing invalid request.p  pNow, I thought about this and know this API can cause some weird behaviour.

I spare you the code in of the myHandler cause it just works by calling initialize afterwards. p  pFor some reason it still giving me the invalid request message.

I tried this on my S2, it just starts the video without any problems. But on the Note 7 and Note 2 the problem  persist. p  pI used the YouTube API before, I never had this kind of problem.p  pedit onError gives me back nothing more than INTERNALERROR, so that isnt of any help.p

I also do NOT want to be using a full blown MMSC gateway such as NowSMS which is windows anyway or MBuni. Please help me to find any Linux tool which can be worked through command line  any compile source code  any method which is easy to use.  p  pThanks in advance for your expertisep
Negative 72 pHeres a question that my team and I have been scouring the internet for help for, with little success.  It sounds like in our minds a common situation and zeroing in on the best approach could be very useful for many. p  pWe have an ASP.NET application that uses .NET code to control data access at a fairly granular level.  That is, we have a user table, a role table, security tables, workflow tables, then lots of business data tables.  Access to business data is highlyconfigurable by the end user, as they can selfadminister user accounts and security directly in the application.  Our .NET C code determines what data a particular request is entitled to based on Windows login, and serves it.  There is no relevant business security using SQL Server loginsroles.  p  pSo, bhow does one implement SSRS into a system that uses .NET code to programmatically enforce data access as defined in relational databp  pWe think our solution would look like one of the following p  p[SSRS Report]  [Datasource]  our .NET code that controls data access  [SQL Server] br  ...or... br  [SSRS Report]  our .NET code that controls data access  [Datasource]  [SQL Server]p  pIf this is correct, then what technology or concept are we missing to make this possible    p  pAny solution should meet these key requirementsp  ol liBusiness power users report creators should be able to create SSRS reports using Report Builder 3.0.  They should still be able to work with business data and relationships using Dataset Design View and Query Designer.li liBusiness power users report creators should not have to implement data access into their reports or data queries.  They should only have to worry about report design.li liEnd users report consumers accessing the report, will get filtered data done by .NET code in their report based on their specific level of access.li ol  pSurely someone else out there is using .NET code to manage data accessis SSRS not an option in this scenariop  pThanksp

Negative 72 pWhat is the best way to share the SQLAlchemy session between my Pyramid application and Celery tasks while only instantiating the database engine once I looked at this answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15071947celerysqlalchemysessionherea, however, I dont want to have to create a another engine that also happens to be global since this is not very DRY. Also, during the Pyramid application startup the application .ini settings are passed into the emmainem function so I would like to be able to configure the engine from this method but also have it available to all Celery tasks. Perhaps I am going about things the wrong way when it comes to Celery integration with Pyramid Thanks for your helpp

What seems to be, as the returned value is just codenullcode. I know all threads share the same codeHttpClientcode with the same codePoolingClientConnectionManagercode thanks to a codeSystem.out.printlnhttpClientcode, printing out the references, but it seems like we still get threadrelated errors in the library probably due to something we did wrong. And while I would love to find a solution to that particular problem, Im much more interested in general approaches to finding the root cause of codeNullPointerExceptioncodes  as I said, emespecially for threadingem, and even more if the exception gets thrown deep eminside a libraryem.p

Negative 72 pAs some of you may or may not know, Microsoft is making clicktorun much more common for all Office products with the 2013 version.  If you write software that uses or integrates with Outlook, Word, or Excel you are probably used to using their Automation APIs, MAPI, or .NET PIAs.  The new virtualized installation of Office products click to run no longer support any outofprocess integration methods whatsoever.p  pDoes anyone here know what Microsofts guidance is in this area going forward for 3rd party integrators  I cant imagine that theyd want the myriad of companies that support their products to just jump ship.  For example if MAPI is no longer functioning how are other processes supposed to read .MSG files, resolve SMTP addresses with exchange, get the global address list from exchange, etcp  pI cant be alone in wondering what the forward path is for 3rd party integrators.  Clearly an inprocess addin is not always feasible. Some integrations are serverbased or cant expect OutlookWord to be running at all times.p  pThe only workaround currently is to install a full MSI version instead of using clicktorun.  The problem is that only volume licenses are given an MSI install.  This doesnt apply evenly across the board.p  pHas anyone else gotten wind on what the future holds, because it seems quite foggy from where we sit.p

Any tips Is there a way to make this even more efficient Is On correct Here is the codep  precodeclass mergesorted     static void Mainstring[] args         int[] x   1, 3, 7         int[] y   2, 4, 5, 6, 15         int[] retrieval   answerx, y          for int i  0 i lt retrieval.Length i             Console.WriteLineretrieval[i]                                  Console.ReadLine           public static int[] answerint[] x, int[] y              int[] a  x         int[] b  y         int abc  0 counter for a         int abc2  0 counter for b         int i  0 counter for index of new array         Boolean flagA  true if flag changed, array is exhaused         Boolean flagB  true         int[] newarray  new int[a.Lengthb.Length] so size is 7          while abc lt a.Length ampamp abc2 lt b.Length             if a[abc] lt b[abc2]                 newarray[i]  a[abc]                 abc                          else                 newarray[i]  b[abc2]                 abc2                           if abc gt a.Length                 flagA  true                 flagB  false                           else if abc2 gt b.Length                 flagA  false                 flagB  true                          i                   if flagA  false             while abc lt a.Length                 newarray[i]  a[abc]                 abc                 i                               else if flagB  false             while abc2 lt b.Length                 newarray[i]  b[abc2]                 abc2                 i                               return newarray       codepre

Negative 72 pI have started working with server side app settings and it would appear the default mechanics for a shared app is to save the app settings across the entire project scope so if an individual makes changes to the app settings, those changes are reflected for all future users. This is not the ideal use in my specific case. I would like it if I could have different settings for each user, without them each adding separate instances of my custom HTML. Is this possible using server side settings, or will I need to look into using cookies to save the settings on each userp  pNote Ive read the documentation on app setting scope a hrefhttpshelp.rallydev.comapps2.0rc1docguidesettingssectiondefinescope relnofollowhttpshelp.rallydev.comapps2.0rc1docguidesettingssectiondefinescopea but it doesnt appear as though user is an option.p  pThanksp

Negative 72 pI am using git as the distributed revision control system to manage the code I develop for my project.

Negative 72 pThe picture shows exactly what the problem is. Ads are being overshadowed by the UITableView. I followed the SplitNavigationBanner project provided by apple and changed it so I can switch between navigation controllers and split view controllers within the app.p  pThe setup is this  1st VC that loads is a navigation view. Ads are hidden but loaded. I then switch over to the Split VC and have ads shown. The result is the picture below.p  pMore Info  I printed all the sizes and everything matches up. In other words, the split view controller and master view controller within it are exactly the same height. Yet its clear there is a shadow over the ads. If ads are loaded AFTER the split VC is shown to screen, there is no problem with ads. Everything lines up at that point. This issue does not occur if the master view controller is a tab view controller. p  pAny thoughts what would cause the shadow over the banner ads Maybe its the way the subviews are loadedimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOGuIZ.png altenter image description herep

Negative 72 pIm writing an application that needs to use geofencing for when someone entersexits multiple sites over the lifetime of the application being installed. p  pMy implementation of geofencing very similar to the second link below is all working fine when I first install the application, both when moving inout of the geofences and when using mock locations to simulate it, until a device is rebooted. p  pOn reboot neither mock locations nor actually physically moving in and out of a geofence appears to trigger the event and fire the pending intent to my broadcast receiver. p  pI have looked at the following three links and have also read quite a bit of the docs but I cant find a definitive answer to this anywhere that straight up says registered geofences persist or do not persist after a reboot.p  pThese are the links I reviewed on stack overflow a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17040889areandroidgeofencessurvivingarebootAre Android geofences surviving a rebootap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19505614androidgeofenceeventuallystopgettingtransitionintentsanswertabactivetabtopAndroid Geofence eventually stop getting transition intentsap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17829976doandroidgeofencesremainactiveuntilremovedexpiredoronlyuntilmypendinDo Android Geofences remain active until removedexpired or only until my PendingIntent is launchedap  pIf anyone happens to know the answer to whether they stick around post reboot, or has a work around if they do not, it would be much appreciated My last hope currently is to create a listener for BOOTCOMPLETED and reregister them on start up but id prefer to only do this if absolutely necessary.p  pThanks a lot in advancep  pEdit Whilst I have not found a definitive in writing answer, I am pretty sure what Mr. TonyC posted is correct, and have opted for that solution.

Negative 72 pIve searched high and low for people with the same question but have only found some variations i.e. R file not generated at all that dont help. Im VERY new to Android development day one, actually but from some tutorials Ive been reading, this behavior is unexpected. Basically, lets say I create a TextView in my activitys XML file and give it an appropriate androidid. I save the file and all other files, but if I try to use findViewById in my Java file, the R.id.[view name] is not listed and displays an error if I manually type it in. If I do a Build Project, it works, but to have to run the Build command upon creation of every new component will be a huge burden Has anyone else experienced this or have ideas on why its happening Thanks in advancep
Negative 72 pIve read the whole Box.com developers api guide and spent hours on the web researching this particular question but I cant seem to find a definitive answer and I dont want to start creating a solution if Im going down the wrong path.  We have a production environment where as once we are finished working with files our production software system zips them up and saves them into a local server directory for archival purposes. This local path cannot be changed. My question is how can I programmatically upload these files to our Box.com account so we can archive these on the cloud Everything Ive read regarding this involves using OAuth2 to gain access to our account which I understand but it also requires the user to login.  Since this is an internal process that is NOT exposed to outside users I want to be able to automate this otherwise it would not be feasable for us. I have no issues creating the programs to trigger everytime a new files gets saved all I need is to streamline the Box.com access.p

Negative 72 pI know the title sounds boring, because many people have already asked about this topic. I hope it can help me get some insight into how the random module works. The issue is, I wrote two different functions that I think should be identical, but the results Im getting are not identical, and I dont understand why.p  pI hope to end up with a wellshuffled deck. I only care about whether cards are red or black, so my decks are very simple. I am calling 1 red and 0 black.p  pMy idea was to build the deck by appending a 1 red if random.random is  .5, or a 0 black otherwise, and then just appending 1 or 0 automatically when I have reached 26 half the deck of one color. But something is going wrong. deckmaker doesnt work properly, although deckmaker2 does. Can anyone provide insightp  precodeimport random  def deckmaker     deck  []     for i in range52         if deck.count0  26             deck.append1         elif deck.count1  26             deck.append0         elif random.random gt .5             deck.append0         else             deck.append1     return deck  def deckmaker2     newdeck  []     for i in range26         newdeck.append0     for i in range26         newdeck.append1     deck  []     for i in range52         x  random.randint0,lennewdeck1         deck.appendnewdeck.popx     return deck codepre  pNote While writing this question I discovered the random.shuffle list operator, which does the same thing as my second function, so of course getting the shuffled deck turns out to be easy. But I still wonder why my original code doesnt do the same thing.p  pstrongEditedstrong Sorry for being vague about the exact problem with deckmaker. The thing is, I dont exactly understand whats wrong. It has to do with the fact that on the decks it produces, as you turn over the cards one by one, there are strategies that let you predict whether the next card is going to be red or black that dont work with decks created using random.shufflep  pstrongEdit 2strong [lots more information] I will explain how I determined that deckmaker doesnt work, in case that is important. I was writing this program to model the puzzle posted here a hrefhttpwww.thebigquestions.com20131217tuesdaypuzzle4 relnofollowhttpwww.thebigquestions.com20131217tuesdaypuzzle4ap  pMy strategy was going to be to remember the last few cards dealt, and use that information to determine when to decide to take the next card. I thought maybe after getting 5 black cards in a row, it was a good time to predict red.

Negative 72 pIn a number of team projects Ive worked on over the past year, we have chosen the Telerik OpenAccess ORM as the tool to manage our database model. We also use TFS as our version control software p  pIve ran into a number of difficulties using the Telerik product which Ill save for another day, but one of the biggest issues is when multiple team members attempt to work on the model simultaneously, and try to commit their changes to TFS. The models generated by Telerik are difficult to merge and any conflicts will, more often than not, lead to time lost fixing the entity model. The only practical way to avoid these difficulties seems to be to implement a relay system, where only one person at a time can work with the model something that isnt practical in a team development environment. p  pHas anyone found a way to use the two tools harmoniouslyp

Negative 72 pI am a newbie in Verilog. I am working on designing a LC3Little Computer CPU. I have designed PC unit, Control Unitas Finite State Machine, Instruction Memory, ALU unit and Data Memory in Modules. There is also a Register File unit which works as Main, module calls are done in this unit.p  pThe problem is when I try to simulate the program, only change that I saw is Clock rises and the Instruction assign to the Instruction wire from the Instruction Memory. I expect the Controller Unit assign the values to the variables like MemRead, PCread, PCwrite etc. at the clock rises, because as Clk rises, stateNext is assigned to the state.p  pWhat could be my mistake Any helps and suggestions are highly appriciated.

Is there a way of achieving this cleanly i.e. not by playing around with cell padding until I get them all the same by trial and error or by arbitrarily assigning an apparently adequate minimum width to every column Also, can it be selectively done for some, but not all columns in a grid e.g. so that columns X emandem Y are are sized according to the widest widget in column X emorem Y, but column Z is sized according to the widest widget in column Zp

In my project I create a create a dynamic array after asking the user how many people that have done sales and how many days they worked. After that the program goes through a for loop to in put the data. Here the user is asked to enter names of the people and it then asks the number of units pre day until the a second for loop reaches the max number of days that the user inputted therein lies my problem.

Please mind that my teacher wants me to use both structure variables and dynamic arrays also note that Im a beginner. p

The provider attempted to automatically create the application services database because the provider determined that the database does not exist. The following configuration requirements are necessary to successfully check for existence of the application services database and automatically create the application services database  If the application is running on either Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008R2, special configuration steps are necessary to enable automatic creation of the provider database. Additional information is available at httpgo.microsoft.comfwlinkLinkId160102. If the applications AppData directory does not already exist, the web server account must have read and write access to the applications directory. This is necessary because the web server account will automatically create the AppData directory if it does not already exist. If the applications AppData directory already exists, the web server account only requires read and write access to the applications AppData directory. This is necessary because the web server account will attempt to verify that the Sql Server Express database already exists within the applications AppData directory. Revoking read access on the AppData directory from the web server account will prevent the provider from correctly determining if the Sql Server Express database already exists. This will cause an error when the provider attempts to create a duplicate of an already existing database. Write access is required because the web server accounts credentials are used when creating the new database. Sql Server Express must be installed on the machine. The process identity for the web server account must have a local user profile. See the readme document for details on how to create a local user profile for both machine and domain accounts. codepre  pStack tracep  precode[SqlException 0x80131904 A networkrelated or instancespecific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server.

Negative 72 pI am updating and redesigning an old website, currently using html 4.01 to html 5. The site has decent search engine rankings and they want to protect this. The redesign consists of fairly simple static pages. I have never updated a live website before, but have a decent grasp of html, css, java and jquery. My first question is is it better to preserve the .htm file extension for the pages that the website currently uses, or redirect them to a new page with a different file extension Secondly, to update the pages, is it as easy as copying and pasting the new html code into the html page files already on the server, and uploading the new css and java files Or should I be using a program to do thisp  pThank you allp

Negative 72 pWhat I am trying to achieve is a SQL query which will insert a new product in the product table which has an auto incremented codeproductidcode value. However, in the Customer table there is also a column for codeproductidcode which is a foreign key referencing the codeproductidcode value in the product table. Now, I can insert a new product and a new customer, but I would like to know how to write a script that takes a query which I can use in a PHP script which will allow a customer insert a new product so that the keys will relate automatically, so one customer can be related to many products.p  pI have tried the references in the PHP manual. p  precode query  mysqlquery INSERT into events VALUES ,eventtype,title,description,date,target,add1,add2,city,postcode,country,tick,NULL  codepre  pfor example i have got an events table for the above query and the Null Value at the end of the query is for the foreign key column userid which is from the user table.......if i was a user inserting the event how would I add my id to the event  p

If I then uncomment the line with codesetBackgroundColorcode the background is cleared, but the custom views background also doesnt shine through where the buttons image is transparent the button image is a circle so I get a rectangle where the windows background shines through i.e. green in the example image, not the background of the view the button is in. p  pHeres an image to make it clear what happensp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comriwf9.png altenter image description herep  pFrom top to bottom p  ul liWhat I want to achieve, i.e. views grey structured bg shines through buttons transparent areali liWhat I get with upper code, i.e. without the uncommented line The custom views background is drawn squeezed into the buttons backgroundli liwhat I get with the codeclearColorcode line, i.e. window color green shines through, not the bg of the view.li ul  pHow can I get the top most resultp  pEdit I pushed an a hrefhttpsgithub.combeipawelButtonTransparencyProblem relnofollowexample project to githuba so that you can see what I mean.p
Negative 72 pI have been reading about file descriptors and how the operating system manages files and provide access to them for processes using the C system call open, and I have couple of questions  p  ul liThe file descriptors table is it just one big data structure that all processes share like, say there are two processes process A and process B, do they have pointers to the OSs file descriptors table, or does the operating system create a whole new array of file descriptors for each process   li liWhat other programming languages can invoke system calls for example, I know that with CC you can easily invoke system calls using the OS interface fork,close,open,execl... and so on, but what about Java I dont recall that theres a way of invoking these functions. how exactly does it work there does the JVM just translate what need to be translated my code to the above system calls so then what about other highlevel programming languages like Python li liWhat harm can be done if I will not close a file after opening it with the system call closeli ul  pThanks.p
Negative 72 pI am working with a set of DTDs from a third party system. Our goal is to map the XML request which conforms to those DTDs into java and then, send an XML response back to the system.p  pDTDs are written in stone I dont have any control in changing those. p  pSo, in order to map, I converted DTDs to XML Schemas xsd using XMLSpy and then, created Jaxb binding classes using XJC compiler. I am using Java 7. p  pThe problem is, the DTDs dont really have a namespace.. and I have 20 different DTDs.. 10 for request and 10 for response. When I generated the schemas, I had to do oneone mapping.. and created the same 10 request XSDs and 10 response XSDs. p  pNow, the jaxb xjc compiler generated binding classes.. but they are far from practical use. There is no inheritance cus these schemas are not related to each other although they seem to have similar content  request types and response types. p  pCan someone please help me if there is a way to customize jaxb bindings to override the default bindings and create more reasonable bindings p  pFor example consider this simple case  p  pDTD p  precodeltELEMENT FromDate PCDATAgt ltATTLIST FromDate     year CDATA REQUIRED     month CDATA REQUIRED     day CDATA REQUIRED gt codepre  pSchema that I generated using XMLSpy p  precodeltxselement nameFromDategt     ltxscomplexType mixedtruegt         ltxsattribute nameyear userequiredgt         ltxsattribute namemonth userequiredgt         ltxsattribute nameday userequiredgt     ltxscomplexTypegt ltxselementgt codepre  pThe binding classes that generated out of XJC compiler java 1.7 p  precodepublic class FromDate       XmlValue     protected String content     XmlAttributename  year, required  true     XmlSchemaTypename  anySimpleType     protected String year     XmlAttributename  month, required  true     XmlSchemaTypename  anySimpleType     protected String month     XmlAttributename  day, required  true     XmlSchemaTypename  anySimpleType     protected String day     ...     ... codepre  pIf you look at how fromDate finally evolved, it doesnt make any sense cus just to get the date from this request, I need to do p  precodesetMyDaterequest.getFromDate.getMonth  request.getFromDate.getDay  request.getFromDate.getYear codepre  pwhich obviously doesnt make sense.

Negative 72 pSo I have a dream. My dream is that my angular application waits as small amount of time as possible before rendering data for the user. Im also imagining that users can use my application without a network connection.p  pBased on this, Im trying to have two levels of cache. They are these are rough names, dont take them literally memory and disk.  Memory is stored as a global variable accessible within my application via a Service. The second is disk and is stored within chrome.storage.sync.p  pSo my application currently tries to load from memory, tries to load from disk, and then sends a slow network request to get the latest, and if found, updates memory and disk.p  pIs this the right approach Im having trouble thinking about how to standardize or abstract this so I dont have to do it manually for each of my data types.

Negative 72 pI think I am in a world of hurt right now. I have written a script in Eclpse. This is the first time Ive used it. Because I work in ArcGIS a lot, I learned how to script using IDLE. I made the switch to Eclipse on the recommendation of a coworker and I love the environment, however, Ive done something to my script that is messing up the indentation and to eb hoenst, I dont know how I did it. I get this weird behavior.p  pIn Eclipse, I receive an error inconsistent Indent at line..... Its weird, because that specific line appears to be in the right indented spot. p  pI will open the script in IDLE and the line appears to be in a different indented location than what I see in Eclipse. This would explain the error, but it doesnt explain why the line appears indented in one IDE and not in the other. p  pI think I learned that it has something to do with the spacetab, tabspace option under Source in Eclipse and the TabifyUntabify option under Format in IDLE. I try to fix it in one IDE, but then it either tabs too much or too little in the other. Im at a loss. I think I havea  mix tabspace thing going on and I want to fix it so that isnt happening. Does this sound like what my problem is How do I fix it How do I set Eclipse so that when this error comes up, the line is displaying the indentation in the wrong location so that I can identify why this error is coming upp

Negative 72 pThis may be too general a question, but its causing me some lost sleep.  Do the designers of WinRT either not understand MVVM patterns or are we supposed to be abandoning MVVM in favor of some other pattern  They have not only removed the DataTemplate pattern where any POCO used in an ItemsControl or ContentControl can be automatically bound to a visual tree, but they went ahead and removed the strongxTypestrong operator as a key into the resource dictionary e.g. xType MyObject.  The confusing thing here is that a DataTemplate replacement is relatively trivial many people have done this for Silverlight, but by removing the strongxTypestrong operator, theyve made it impossible to even write a replacement DataTemplate search in WinRT.p  pSo my question is, why do the architects of WinRT appear to be going out of their way to prevent us from using an MVVM pattern to build applications  Is there a better pattern that Ive not yet foundp

I assume Ill need to reposition it after the image has finished loading but due to the scarce documentation Im not sure how. p  pI understand there is a reposition function but it doesnt seem to work the way Im applying it.

Negative 72 pI had a simple requirement where I need to find the occurance of strings in one vector from a master list of strings in another vector.

But later it turned out that each string in the masterlist was associated with an identifier.

In effect I thought Id change masterlist to a map, like sop  precodemapltstring, SomeCustomIdgt masterlist codepre  pand be able to do something likep  precodeauto Iwantthisid  masterlist[targetlist[0]     codepre  pBut now I am not sure if I can use setintersection to compare two completely different containers customlist, a vector and masterlist, a map even if I write my own comparison function.

Negative 72 pI have a Rails production application that is down several times per day. This application, in addition to serving its users, is the endpoint for a 3rd party website that sends it updates.p  pOccasionally, these updates will come flooding in so fast that the requests back up and the application becomes unavailable for long periods of time. It is a legitimate usage which ends up causing a Denial of Service.p  pThe request from the 3rd party is pretty simplep  precodeclass NotificationsController lt ApplicationController    def notify     begin       notificationxml  request.body.read       notificationhash  Hash.fromxmlitemresponsexml[Envelope][Body][NotificationResponse]       user  User.findnotificationhash[UserID]       user.delay.setnotificationnotificationhash     rescue Exception gt bang       logger.error bang.backtrace       unless user.blank         alertfilename  user.idnotificationhash[Message][MessageID]notificationhash[NotificationEventName]notificationhash[Timestamp].xml         File.openalertfilename, w f f.writenotificationxml        end     end     render nothing true, status 200   end  end codepre  pI have two app servers against a very large database. However, when this 3rd party website really hits us with the notification requests, over 200 per minute up to close to 1,000 requests per minute, both webservers get completely tied up.p  pYou can also see above that Im using the code.delaycode call since Im using Sidekiq. I thought that would help, and it did for a while, but the application cant handle that many requests.p  pOther than handling the requests in a separate application, which Im not sure is really possible in my codeEngineYardcode installation, is there something I can do to speed up the handling of this requestp
Negative 72 pIve been trying to configure our TC installation to work with the following scenario p  pWe have multiple developers working on multiple bugs in parallel. Our source code is stored in github and we are using pull requests. Id like Teamcity to trigger a build on pull request as described here a hrefhttpblog.jetbrains.comteamcity201302automaticallybuildingpullrequestsfromgithubwithteamcity relnofollowhttpblog.jetbrains.comteamcity201302automaticallybuildingpullrequestsfromgithubwithteamcitya which seems quite easy to do. Unfortunately it looks like such configuration doesnt MERGE the pull request, but simply PULL it from the repository.p  pLet me give you an examplep  pDeveloper A opens pull request nr 1 based on code version 0010. Developer B opens a pull request nr 2 also based on code version 0010. Current code version in the repository is 0015. Our TeamCity server for each pull request should first checkout the version 0015 of the source code, then merge changes in pull nr 1. If this merge is successful, then it should try and compile the code. Similar should be done for pull nr 2.p  pMind you that I need TC to merge against the CURRENT version of the code in the branch, not just pull the version from the pull request.p  pPull request nr 1 is reviewed and accepted, and merged into the production repository. This should trigger a rebuild of pull request nr 2, as now the current branch is not 0015, but 0015 with the code from pull nr 1. p  pI understand that with many pull requests, every merge triggers an avalanche of buildsrebuilds. But this is exactly what I need TC for. Part of the Continuous Integration process should be making sure that the source code from a pull request should merge with the current head without any conflicts.p  pAfter configuring the TC server as described in the link, it doesnt really merge against the HEAD, but simply performs git pull and compile. Which is not helpful at all, as this should always work provided that the developer is compiling the code on their machine before they commit changes. p  pId appreciate any hints or ideas on how to set our CI environment co we can test an actual merge against the most current code, not just a simple compilation. p

Negative 72 pRight now Im trying to parse a date thats written in a humanreadable format into a DateTime String that a SharePoint list will accept. In order to do this Ive determined that I need a String in a format similar to ISO that looks like code20070820T000000Zcode. It seems that SharePoint only accepts DateTimes that are in UTC with no milliseconds included for whatever reason, SharePoint gives errors and wont accept the DateTime when you include the milliseconds, so I need to convert my local time into a UTC time before converting it to the ISO string.p  pHeres the process that the code below is using.p  ol liFirst I use DateJS to parse my humandate into a JavaScript Date. Works fine, but apparently DateJS has been abandoned, so maybe I should change this to use MomentJS.li liNext I tried to create a new moment in UTC. This line is very, very wrong, and crashes my program. li liThen I have SPServices convert it into an ISO. SPServices drops the milliseconds off the DateTime so that SharePoint will accept it.

Negative 72 pIm taking lots of inspiration from app strongGo Lockerstrong and project a hrefhttpsgithub.comJoisarLockScreenApp relnofollowLockScreenAppa, to create a basic lockscreen app that displays various pictures, randomly picked from a folder on device storage. App is working fine. My event receiver receives codeACTIONSCREENOFFcode event properly, kicking off my codeActivitycode, which is visible on front when screen is switched back on. I can swipe on my view to unlock, works fine. So far so good. p  pNext step is to handle home codeButtoncode. Now I know that codeonAttachedToWindowcode of handling home codeButtoncode press doesnt work with 4.X. Im working with S2 4.1.2. p  pAlthough, it definitely seem possible, as strongGo Lockerstrong does this on the same device flawlessly, without a single blink on the screen. p  pInitially I thought setting my app as default launcher might resolve this, but strongGo Lockerstrong doesnt do that. I can successfully continue using my strongNova Launcherstrong as my default launcher, yet strongGo Lockerstrong lockscreen successfully intercepts HOME key press and keep me on the lockscreen. p  pI tried intercepting codeonPausecode amp codeonStop events on mycodeActivitycode, and kicking off another instance of mycodeActivity from there, but it doesnt work that way. p  pstrongGo Lockerstrong seems to be doing something cleverer than that. Any idea how this can be achieved pleasep

Thanks in advance.p  pEDIT 1p  pIve made a bit of progress on this problem so far. If I crop the image beforehand so as to contain just a bit of the layers, Ive been able to use the following code to get at the thicknesses of each layer.p  precodeimport numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from scipy import ndimage from PIL import Image from skimage.measure import regionprops  tap  Image.openVDtap.png.convertL tapa  np.arraytap  tapg  ndimage.gaussianfiltertapa, 1 tapnorm  tapg  tapg.minfloattapg.max  tapg.min tapnorm[tapnorm lt 0.5]  0 tapnorm[tapnorm gt 0.5]  1  result  255  tapnorm  255.astypenp.uint8  taplabeled, count  ndimage.labelresult  props  regionpropstaplabeled ds  np.array[]  for i in xrangelenprops     if i0         ds  np.appendds, props[i].bbox[1]  0     else         ds  np.appendds, props[i].bbox[1]  props[i1].bbox[3]      ds  np.appendds, props[i].bbox[3]  props[i].bbox[1] codepre  pEssentially, I discovered the Python module skimage, which can take a labeled image array and return the four coordinates of a boundary box for each labeled object the a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comqmYFK.png relnofollow1a and [3] positions give the x coordinates of the boundary box, so their difference yields the extent of each layer in the xdimension. Also, the first part of the for loop the ifelse condition is used to get the lightrare layers that precede each darkdense layer, since only the dark layers get labeled by ndimage.label.p  pUnfortunately this is still not ideal. Firstly, I would like to not have to crop the image beforehand, as I intend to repeat this procedure for many such images. Ive considered that perhaps the rough periodicity of the layers could be highlighted using some sort of filter, but Im not sure if such a filter exists Secondly, the code above really only gives me the emrelativeem width of each layer  I still havent figured out a way to incorporate the scale bar so as to get the actual widths.p

In other words, a pair is dominated if another pair is better in one value and not worse in the other.p  pMy research up to this point has yielded three working algorithms, that are unfortunately all reliant on loops. Heres how they work and what time I got for running them with codexcode, codeycode and codeacode of length code1e8codep  blockquote   ol   liSort codexcode in ascending order.

Negative 72 pstrongGoalstrongp  pIve been trying to write a generic helperutility class in C that represents a boundschecked range of numbers. p  pThe idea is that the user can create a contiguous range of numbers by defining a minimum and maximum value for example, from 0 to 10, from 15 to 3, from 7 to 2, etc.. The range also contains a current value, and the value is checked against the upperlower limits. If the current value is large than the max or lower than the min it is either capped or wraps around.

Im still unsure of where to go from here, though. My code emstill wont compile due to the various addition, subtraction, increment, and decrement operators that Ive been usingem. Ive tried to add byte, short, int, and float as additional type constraints, but that didnt work and it gave me a compiletime error.p  pWhat options do I have from here Because this class is only meant to deal with ranges of numbers basically only integers of various sizes [byte, short, int, long maybe] and floatingpoint decimals and not nullable or reference types, is there some other constraint that I can use to make this work Do I have to make a bunch of wrapper classes around the basic data types that implement a custom INumber interfacep  pOr is this a misuse of generic classes, and I should just make a bunch of standalone range classes for the different types Is it possible to make a generic class that implements the type of behavior that I wantp

That long string of hex on the end is the md5 digest of some view that Rails wants to associate with this cache fragment.p  pI believe I have no need for cache digests. My application gets updated pretty infrequently, and generally I can clear the cache when its updated, so the concept of a cache fragment that refers to a previous deployments version of a piece of my view code is irrelevant.p  pI see that I can modify any given call to codecachecode with the codeskipdigest gt truecode flag. a hrefhttpsreinteractive.netposts197ifyouexplicitlyexpirecachedfragmentsoptoutofcachedigests relnofollowThis blog posta refers to modifying a large number of their codecachecode calls to add codeskipdigestcode.

In   future, we can use load balancer to reduce the number of requests   going to each server assuming 1 server are in production Advantage   of this would be to reduce number of requestsserver, increase   availability in case one server fails, and handle spikey traffic   well.p      pFor data storage, to store 3.6 TB of data we will need a few machines   to hold it in database. We can use a noSQL db or SQL db. Given how the   latter has more widespreaduse and community support which would help   in troubleshooting matters and is used by large firms at the moment, I   would choose mySQL db. p      pAs the data grows, I would adopt the following strategies to handle   itp      p1 Create unique index on the hashp      p2 Scale mySQL db vertically by adding more memoryp      p3 Partition the data by sharding p      p4 Use a masterslave replication strategy with mastermaster   replication to ensure redundancy of datap      pstrongConclusionstrongp      pHence, this would be my design of the components of a job scheduler.p blockquote

Negative 72 pConsider a question to find a minimum dominating set of an interval graph. In the context of interval scheduling, it is converted to the question belowp  pThere are multiple intervals which may or may overlap with each other.

Negative 72 pIm having a class Woning house and a subclass KoopWoning buyable House and a subclass HuurWoning rentable House. KoopWoning and Huurwoning extend Woning. HuurWoning is just a Woning, whereas KoopWoning has an extra variable energylevel. KoopWoning has also a function getEnergylevel, which returns the energylevel of the KoopWoning. I also have a class Portefeuille which has an arraylist of Woningen.p  pIm reading all Woningen in a Portefeuille from a textfile. In a 5th class, I want to be able to sort the ArrayList of Woningen of Portefeuille from the textfile. I have a function woningenTotint maxprijs which returns an ArrayList with all the Woningen that fullfil the requirement having a price below maxprijs. These Woningen I want to print on the screen.p  pThe problem is as follows It can be possible that there is also a KoopWoning in the file. In that case I also want to be able to sort on energylevel. However, I cant sort on the energylevels. I cant call the function getEnergylevel because its an ArrayList, and Woning doesnt contain the function getEnergylevel.p  pSo how can I solve this If its too vague, I could include the code, however its quite big Op  pAny help is appreciated i have spent a couple of hours on this program, from which at least 1.5 hours on this problem alone p  pEDIT Here is the code for class KoopWoningp  precodepublic class KoopWoning extends Woning implements EnergiepeilWoning  private char energiepeil  public KoopWoning Adres adres, int kamers, int vraagPrijs, char energiepeil      superadres, kamers, vraagPrijs     this.energiepeil  energiepeil    public char getEnergiepeil       return energiepeil   public boolean compareEnergiepeil Object other      boolean res  false     if other instanceof KoopWoning          KoopWoning that  KoopWoning other         res  this.getEnergiepeil  that.getEnergiepeil          return res    public String toString       String res  adres  ,   kamers   kamers, prijs   prijs  , energiepeil   energiepeil     return res  codepre  pAnd here is the code for class Woningp  precodepublic class Woning  protected int kamers protected int prijs protected Adres adres protected String tag  public Woning Adres adres, int kamers, int prijs      this.adres  adres     this.kamers  kamers     this.prijs  prijs        public String toString       String res  adres  ,   kamers   kamers, prijs   prijs     return res   public void setTag String tag      this.tag  tag   public String getTag       return tag   public boolean kostHooguit int maxprijs      return prijs lt maxprijs   public boolean equals Object other      boolean res  false     if other instanceof Woning          Woning that  Woning other         if this.adres.equalsthat.adres             res  true          return res   public static Woning read Scanner sc      try          Adres adress  Adres.readsc         int kamer  sc.nextInt         sc.next         sc.next         int prijs  sc.nextInt         String check  sc.next         if check.equalsenergiepeil              char peil  sc.next.charAt0             KoopWoning kwoning  new KoopWoning adress, kamer, prijs, peil             return kwoning                  else              Woning woning  new Woning adress, kamer, prijs             return woning                   catch Exception e          System.out.printlnWoning Exception is caught         System.out.printlne.getMessage         Adres adress  new Adres , , ,          Woning woning  new Woning adress, 0, 0         return woning        codepre  pAnd lastly, the code for the class Portefeuillep  precodepublic class Portefeuille   private ArrayListltWoninggt woninglijst  public Portefeuille       woninglijst  new ArrayListltWoninggt   public void voegToe Woning woning      if woninglijst.containswoning         woninglijst.addwoning   public ArrayListltWoninggt woningenTot int maxprijs      ArrayListltWoninggt woninglijst2  new ArrayListltWoninggt     for int i  0 i lt woninglijst.size i          ifwoninglijst.geti.kostHooguitmaxprijs             woninglijst2.addwoninglijst.geti          return woninglijst2   public String toStringExt       String res  [     for int i  0 i lt woninglijst.size i         res  res  woninglijst.geti.toString        if woninglijst.size  0         res  res.substring 0, res.length  2     res  res  ]     return res   public String toString       String res       for int i  0 i lt woninglijst.size i         res  woninglijst.geti.toString2     return res   public boolean equals Object other      boolean res  false     if other instanceof Portefeuille          Portefeuille that  Portefeuille other         if this.woninglijst.size  that.woninglijst.size              int i  0             while i lt this.woninglijst.size ampamp this.woninglijst.geti.equalsthat.woninglijst.geti                 i  i  1             res  i  this.woninglijst.size                   return res   public static Portefeuille read String infile      try          Scanner sc  new Scanner new Fileinfile         ArrayListltWoninggt wlijst  new ArrayListltWoninggt         Portefeuille p  new Portefeuille         int woningen  sc.nextInt         int i  0         while i lt woningen              sc.nextLine             String tag  sc.nextLine             wlijst.addWoning.readsc             p.voegToewlijst.geti             i                  sc.close         return p           catch Exception e          System.out.printlnPortefeuille Exception is caught         Portefeuille p  new Portefeuille         return p           codepre  h2EDITh2  pI fixed it myself.

Negative 72 pI have a polar plot and to the right of it its legend. The legend can have between 1 and 40 items whose length will be between 4 and 32 characters. My goal is to center the plot and the legend as if it was one object on the matplotlib sheet or rather empty whitespace.p  pI found the following and adjusted it to my needsp  precodeimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np  x  np.arange10  fig  plt.figure ax  plt.subplot111, polarTrue  for ap in aps     ax.plotangles, ap, label32Characters   Shrink current axis by 20 box  ax.getposition ax.setposition[box.x0, box.y0, box.width  0.8, box.height]   Put a legend to the right of the current axis ax.legendloccenter left, bboxtoanchor1, 0.5  plt.show codepre  pThe problem is it doesnt adjust for the length of the labels. Everything perfectly fits when the labels are 48 characters long but as it does just shrink the plot by 20  as soon as 32 character long string appear, they are cut offp  pstrongWhat I wantstrong is the plot  legend as one object centered on the sheetpageempty whitespace, so that when there is a long label the plot is just offset a little bit more to the left in order to compensate for it.

Negative 72 pI would like to write a simple Oracle SQL 10g statement to compare the items strings in an arbitrarily defined comma separated list to a field containing a list of comma separated strings.  The items in the defined list can appear in the field in any order, and exact matches need to be found not substrings.p  pI have a working solution using a series of regexplike statements entered manually, but I need to hand this off to a client who will be maintaining this moving forward, and would like to be able to just update the comma separated string directly.p  pI also have some software GUI based limitations on what I can do with Oracle SQL to accomplish this.  Specifically I can not use any PLSQL and this must be written in a single select statement no temporary tables or anything funuseful like that.  Ive found a number of solutions to what Im trying to accomplish, but almost all depended on being able to write custom functions.p  pSo, now that backstorylimitations are out of the way, lets get down to the nitty gritty.p  pExample arbitrary clientprovided list ItemA,ItemB,ItemCp  pTable ITEMSbr  Column Items varchar2 of some arbitrary but sufficient lengthp  ul liItemA,ItemB,ItemCli liItemC,ItemB,ItemAli liItemX,ItemC,ItemY,ItemA,ItemB,ItemBli liItemX,ItemY,ItemCli ul  pI want a single select statement that will basically select all rows where Items contains ItemA and ItemB and ItemC, but without having to break that string up manually.  In this case, it would match the first, second and third row, but not the fourth row.p  pEDIT I realize this table structure is badly designed.  At this time I do not know if we can go back to the client to fix this as the data may be used as is elsewhere already, making a redesign would be costly and time consuming.  Im sure a lot of you are used to this scenario.  The initial system was designed poorly, now Ive been brought in to consult on difficulties arising from the poor design.  Lets assume it is not possible to normalize this table, and must be used as is.p  pIt is entirely possible that what I would like to do is simply not possible given the limitations of the interface I need to use, but my SQL knowledge is not great enough to determine that.p  pThank you all very much for taking the time to read this question.  Please let me know if anything is confusing or needs expansion or clarification.p

Negative 72 pSo some quick background information to describe my problem.  I have a project named codePearcode that contains a basic Spring project, using Maven.  I put this exact project into a SVN repository, and then imported it into this same EclipseSTS instance under the name of codeSpringTestRepocode.p  pThe problem is, this imported repository contains no Run options that the one I created in Eclipse originally has.  For example, in the codePearcode project, codeRuncode  codeRun Ascode gives the option to run on an embedded Tomcat server.  In the codeSpringTestRepocode project, I have no options  anything past codeRun Ascode is greyed out.p  pAnother thing that Im having a problem with in the difference between the two projects is that the one I imported via SVN SpringTestRepo has no little S or M by the name of the project.  Its also missing several handy annotations, such as a list of methods underneath my codeHomeController.javacode class.p  pHere is a picture to help illustrate my problem.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comj6OoH.png altenter image description herep  pAny ideas as to how to resolve this issuep  pEdit Just to be clear, its a little hard to see but just above the codePearcode project there is a little Maven M and a little Spring S symbol.  p

I tried switching my if and else conditions but I couldnt get it to work.   p  pJavascript Codep  precode.save.onclick, function  console.logSaving property id to local storage try      this.attrdisabled, true      var propIdToAdd  this.closestp.attrid      var myFavouriteProp  JSON.parselocalStorage.getItemdata      if data.Properties.id  myFavouriteProp          alertSame property is already favourited      elsemyFavouriteProp  null     myFavouriteProp  []     myFavouriteProp.pushpropIdToAdd      localStorage.setItemdata, JSON.stringifymyFavouriteProp  catch e      if e  QUOTAEXCEEDEDERR          console.logError Local Storage limit Exceeded      else          console.logError Saving to Local Storage         viewFavourites.onclick, function  console.logRestoring array data from local storage  myFavouriteProp  JSON.parselocalStorage.getItemdata var output  ltulgt if myFavouriteProp  null      for var i  0 i lt data.Properties.length i          for j  0 j lt myFavouriteProp.length j              if data.Properties[i].id  myFavouriteProp[j]                  output  ltligt  data.Properties[i].id  ltligt                             output  ltulgt document.getElementByIdplaceholder.innerHTML  output   codepre  pI didnt point this out but, how do I allow it to view all of my ids i.e prop1, prop2. My save function currently overwrites the old values stored in the local storage. But my old save function allowed me to display all the IDs code shown below p  precode    .save.onclick, function   try       this.attrdisabled,true        var propIdToAdd  this.closestp.attrid        var myFavouriteProp  JSON.parselocalStorage.getItemdata       if myFavouriteProp  null            myFavouriteProp  []              myFavouriteProp.pushpropIdToAdd        localStorage.setItemdata, JSON.stringifymyFavouriteProp      catche        if e  QUOTAEXCEEDEDERR            console.logError Local Storage limit exceeds.               else            console.logError Saving to local storage.              codepre  pAlso, when I try to add codeif data.Properties.id  myFavouriteProp[0]code it stops my buttons from working. After I click the save button and then click the view button, nothing is displayed. Without [0] it displays the alert box and what is contained in the storage. But like I said, my current code not the old one overwrites old data and replaces it with new data. It should not do this. It should allow me to display id values of prop1, prop2, etc. Not prop2 by itself after overwriting the value id prop1. They should not overwrite as they are different ids.p

Negative 72 pI am using Spring annotations with boot.p  pCurrently, im handling static content in the following wayp  precodeRequestMappingpath[.] public String getResourceFilePathVariablepath String path    return path  .html  codepre  pThat way, if one access mysite.comlogin, he will get login.html file.p  pNote I do know one can configure spring to handle static content rather than implement a controller method, however I was unable to achieve the above result, no matter the configuration.p  pAnyhow, my current problem is I dont want users to actually reach the .html files. That is, I want the above to still work, AND any user trying to reach .html file will get an error not found.p  pI thought about implementing a controller method for .html files regex pattern matching, However they also trigger when I try to forward the url from the controller file, as mentioned above.p  pHow can I achieve this thenp  h1EDITh1  pAlso, I would love to know how I can redirect from a controller, to a notcontroller even if it matches. That way, Ill be able to create a controller for all paths. Note currently, I only handle one url level That is, the url mysite.comdatalogin will not match. And I cant use , since it will then be recursive. That is, im looking for something like the followingp  precodeRequestMapping public String getResourceHttpServletRequest request    String path  request.getAttributeHandlerMapping.PATHWITHINHANDLERMAPPINGATTRIBUTE     Following is WRONG.    It will call this function over and over again, resulting    in path.html.html.html ..   return path  .html  WRONG  codepre

Negative 72 pFirst of all, I am very new to Swift programming, so please be patient with me I am in the process of making PONG classic game, Im sure youve heard of it for iOS in Swift. I am trying to make the game ball move around the screen. Now in VB which is what I used to code in I would just drag a timer to the view, set an interval and write something like    codeball.top  5code  in its own, personal sub. I dont really know how to go about this in Swift though, I have gotten as far as    codeNSTimer.scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval0.5, target self, selector timerDidFire, userInfo nil, repeats truecode But I have no idea what this does, or where to write the code which is to be executed every time the timer fires. I also need to know how to enable and disable timers p  pThanks a LOT for any helpp

Negative 72 pI want to begin rewriting step by step a data access layer in an old application. We use the Entity Framework as object relational mapper, so the pure data access is already done. What still needs to be done is providing the next layer I call it that because its not clear right now if the old business layer is going to stay at all this might lead to the question where the methods Im talking about should go, layerwise with the necessary methods to get the data it needs.p  pSince there will be many methods needed, putting them all in one huge interfaceclass didnt seem the right way of doing it to me. I rather think of separating these getting data methods thematically. That is, something like thisp  precodeinterface IBillDataAccess  ..  interface IAttestationDataAccess  ..  interface ICustomerDataAccess  ..  codepre  pand so on.p  p1 Do you think it is useful here to use interfaces at all I think so, even when the implementation of those is not likely going to change Id have to add new methods to both the interface and implementation.p  p2 I would usually accumulate the creation of the concrete implementation of these interfaces inside a provider class, as I have seen in many of our smaller projects before. It usually looks like this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26354722whatkindofpatternisthisprovidersimilar old question of minea, but now I have way more interfacesp  precodepublic static class DataAccessProvider    public static ICustomerDataAccess GetCustomerDataAccess        return new CustomerDataAccess       public static IBillDataAccess GetBillDataAccess        return new BillDataAccess       and so on  codepre  pSomething about this design is bothering me, though I cannot put my finger on it. Im sure your opinions will help me out herep  pAnother point intersects with 1 Im not yet sure if I like the codeDataAccesscode classes not being static. But having static classes for this would mean I cant use any interface.p  pI appreciate any input on this as Im really quite insecure about all this, and unfortunately the people Id usually ask are not here for the time being. Feel free to doubt and criticize anything I did in the above p

Negative 72 pWhat is an idiomatic way in C to have an object store that can be searched with respect to two keys Essentially what I would like is to store things of type A in a binary search tree BST with the BST constructed using the order relation on A.key. However, each A also has a unique A.otherval and I essentially need to delete keys based on this value.p  pIn C I would typically just have a BST with parent pointers and a hash table based with the other values as a key storing pointers to nodes of the BST. I can delete keys through the hash table by getting the node and calling tree delete on that node.p  pIm looking for how to do this correctly using STL containers.p

Negative 72 pBy reading the following post from a hrefhttp12factor.netlogs relnofollow12factora I have come up with a question Id like to check how you guys handle this.p  pBasically, an app should write directly to stdoutstderr.

Negative 72 pI am dealing with a multiproduct codebase that has two separate CCLI projects, both used to Interop between a large unmanaged C shared core code and WPF and ASP.NET UI frontends. One is generic and used in every product lets call it CLI.Interop.Shared, and one product has specific project for highly specialized use that we dont want to clutter the general one with lets call it CLI.Interop.Product. p  pThe CLI.Interop.Shared contains code relevant to every product such as marshalling SystemString to a customimplemented C string, and so on, CLI.Interop.Product has highly specialized code relating the the single product. As far as Im concerned, this seems like a simple and logical decomposition, but the simplicity ends there.p  pCurrently, we have essentially hacked the CLI.Interop.Shared into the CLI.Interop.Product by adding it as a Project Reference and then actually including headers from it. This works for pure headers situations where we might need the marshalas templates for marshalling, but when we want more interoperation, this set up does not work with basically anything with an include guard as it will overwrite it as it is a separate assembly, and has shadowing issues with compiled CCLI files.p  pFor example, here is where we run into issues, where I am attempting to inherit a productspecific API based on one in CLI.Interop.Sharedp  precodepragma once  include .FooAPI.h  msclr      interop              product                      foo                              public ref class ProductFooAPI  public msclrinteropfooFooAPI                                                codepre  pThis will generate redefinition issues C2011 and use of undefined type C2027 errors, and will not compile. My working theory is that its just dumping everything from the included files into the new assembly, but then when compared, it will have obvious conflicts. Also, again, this does not appear to be the supported methodology of referencing other CCLI assemblies.p  pI then tried to switch it the proper from what I can gather way of using using, and referencing a .obj file adding the correct directory to the Additional using Directories. The issue is unresolved and seems similar I get complaints of the symbol already being imported, as suchp  precodeError   14  error C3846 FooClass cannot import symbol from ccheckoutmainrepodotnetlibrariesCLI.Interop.Sharedproduct debugfooapi.obj as msclrinteropfooFooClass has already been imported from another assembly CLI.Interop.Shared codepre  pRemoving the Project Reference I have set up in the CLI.Interop.Product to CLI.Interop.Shared creates the obvious error ofp  precode error LNK1312 invalid or corrupt file unable to import assembly  ccheckoutmainrepodotnetlibrariesCLI.Interop.Sharedproduct debugCLI.Interop.Shared.lib codepre  pIve tried directly referencing the DLL i.e. using CLI.Interop.Shared.dll and using CLI.Interop.Shared.lib, to no avail. I think Ive gone about in circles about this in every way possible. Am I missing something Is there an obvious solution Is there something I havent mentioned that will illuminate this at all Im tired of using hacked CLI projectsp

Negative 72 pI have a working code where you can control the movement of a goldfish with the arrow keypad. When you press the up key, the goldfish swim up. When you press the down key, the goldfish swim down. When you press the left key, the goldfish swim left. And when you press the right key, the goldfish swim right. I made it so that the goldfishs pixel increase or decrease by exactly 1 pixel every time it moves in a new direction, but when you do it like that the goldfish swims very slowly. I know that if you increase the pixel by more than 1 the goldfish seems to be swimming faster, but then that way it wouldnt paint every pixel, and the goldfish swimming wont look as smooth.

Negative 72 pI am using gridx and details on demand module for mobile interface. I am having issue with TouchScroll module. When I add the module as per this a hrefhttpsgithub.comoriagridxwikiHowtomakegridxscrollableoniPad3F5Bv1.15D relnofollowhttpsgithub.comoriagridxwikiHowtomakegridxscrollableoniPad3F5Bv1.15Da , it does not do any click events or open the details on demand when I click the row. I had to disable it and just use TouchVScroller,  but that does not do a good job of scrolling in a mobile.  Anyway hoping someone has had a similar thing and or there is a way to use TouchScroll and enable clicks.p

Negative 72 pSo the devil is in the details in this question.p  pI want to create some svg components with encapsulated behaviour and therefore I want to include a script tag inside the external svg files.  Now, this works fine from HTML5 when you include via object or embed, etc.  But I want to reference these svg files from within an svg tag inside an svg element.p  pSo, from within svg, the only ways I know of to include an svg file via xlinkhref is with either an image tag or a use tag.  Neither, however, will accept a script tag in their content model, which I emassumeem is why the script tags are not being interpreted and Im pretty sure they are not being interpreted.  I am escaping the scripts in CData format inside the svgs, so I dont think it is a parsing problem.p  pHere is a brief example of what I mean.p  pThe Html Filep  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt   ltheadgt     ltmeta charsetUTF8gt   ltheadgt   ltbodygt     ltdiv idtopgt       ltsvg idmap viewBox  0 0 500 500 version  1.1 width250 height250        xmlnshttpwww.w3.org2000svg        xmlnsxlinkhttpwww.w3.org1999xlinkgt         ltimage x0 y110 width100 height100 xlinkhrefsvgobjexample.svg gt       ltsvggt     ltdivgt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pAnd svgobjexample.svgp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingiso88591gt ltsvg viewBox  0 0 500 500 version  1.1 width250 height250  xmlnshttpwww.w3.org2000svg  xmlnsxlinkhttpwww.w3.org1999xlinkgt    ltscript typeapplicationecmascriptgt lt[CDATA[     function circleclickevt        var circle  evt.target       var currentRadius  circle.getAttributer       if currentRadius  100         circle.setAttributer, currentRadius2       else         circle.setAttributer, currentRadius0.5        ]]gt ltscriptgt    ltcircle cx200 cy200 r100 fillyellow strokeblack strokewidth3 onclickcircleclickevt onactivatecircleclickevt mouseovercircleclickgt  ltsvggt codepre  pTo eliminate the likelihood of parsing errors, I cut and paste the above script from a W3C example iir.

Negative 72 pI am currently working on an Android app.It has a navigation drawer and a few fragments.I want the actionbar title to change depending on the fragment.I have managed to do this.But the problem is when i press the back button the setTitle method is executed and the title is changed but it does not reflect on the action bar visibly.Any help would be appreciated.ASAP EDIT I found out that the problem was with the navigation drawer opening and closing .So I removed the changing title part from the ondraweropened and ondrawerclosed .It solved the current problem.But I want  the name to change on opening and retain the current fragment name on closing.Can anyone help me on that...

Negative 72 pSo ive been lurking around here for the past few years and have finally come to the situation where I did NOT find an existing answer here. The question itself is pretty simple though.p  hr  pAssume the following statement no language specific syntaxp  precodevar result  fetchFromDb  null  defaultValue  fetchFromDb.property codepre  pWhat I want to know is does the compiler in Java or C have a way to optimise this statement or will there really be two calls to the codefetchFromDbcode method meaning two DB access calls, two execution plans and so onp  pI already have tested this in Java and found out that the method is called twice, but I have no idea about eventual caching in the background or anything alike.p  pSo is using the ternary conditional with methods a bad practice Is there a way to cache the value compared against inline in order to preserve the beauty of this stylep

I do it this way, because the same application code can be used with different collections of data to produce different applications... the starting point does the selection of which application.p  pI just tested with IE 11 and at least it loads the manifest file. I dont know how to tell if it is downloading the rest of the files in the background, but after a while, I disabled the network adapter, and not all the files were there yet, so I dont know whether it was using the appcache, or just the regular cache to reload the start page of the application.  As soon as I turned the network adapter back on, though, IE loaded the missing audio file I was trying to listen to.p  pOpera seems to behave the same as Chrome, apparently that is part of the code they share.p  pEDITp  pI learned some more... I set up a tiny test case, less than a dozen files, and 1 the manifest file was not reported in the Network tab activity for reloading the page 2 neither were the files loaded because the manifest file existed shown in the Network tab activity 3 The caching actually did happen, and a list of files showed up in the Application Cache section of the Resources tab.  But, with my much bigger application, the Application Cache section just shows Checking status, with no file list, and no network activity.  For hours.p

Negative 72 pUsing R, I would like to know the best way to estimate coefficients using a string of dummy variables and already set coefficients.

So what I want to estimate here is the coefficients for each Item indicating the international price of an item, as well as coefficient for each country indicating the PPPpurchasing power parity of that country. I need to use the formulap  pln Pjk  b1X1  b2X2  . . .  bn1Xn1  Z1Y1  Z2Y2  . . .  ZmYm  u,p  pwhere n  number of countries, m  number of items in a basic heading, j  1,2,...,n1 k  1,2 .... m, and where ln P is the natural logarithm of the price of an item k in country j. Each of the n1 countries being compared, other than the numeraire country, is represented by an X dummy variable, and each of the m items in the heading is represented by a Y dummy variable. The country coefficients, the bs, are the natural logarithm of the estimated country parity for the heading, and the item coefficients, the zs, are the natural logarithms of the estimates of the item prices in the currency of the numeraire country.p  pI copied this from a hrefhttpunstats.un.orgunsdmethodsicpipc5htm.htm relnofollowthis examplea and want to use the CPD approach. p  pMy question is how to enter this into R to obtain these estimates And what if I already have the coefficients for bs PPP for each country p

That works fine, I can make manual calls with curl for example to domain2 using the LtpaToken2 from the webclient obtain from domain1.p  pThe problem is When I make the CORS call from the web client, I use withCredentials to true, but withCredentials includes cookies from the remote domain, and of course I have no cookie yet since the browser does not know the domain2 yet.

Negative 72 pIm a 3rd year computer science college student, and Im looking to make an application that notifies me when there is a query result change on a hrefhttppucatrade.com relnofollow titlepucatradepucatradea. A quick summary Pucatrade is a website where you can trade Magic the Gathering cards to other people without a third party involvement. Some person will submit a want for a specific card  if they have equal or more points than the value of that card, it will show to other users that this person wants the card. Another person who owns a particular card can search to see if anybody wants the card. If there is a person who wants it, heshe can commit to send.p  pI have a number of cards that I would like to trade away, and want to develop an application that will notify me when someone wants a card that I have. As a student that has only been coding in CC and Python, I cannot quite get a good grasp on something that involves database and query. Where is a good place to get started on and what tools should I be looking into Or is this something that is out of my scope and I should start with simpler database project Any tips, advice, and criticism would be greatly appreciated.p

The only way I can see this process possibly failing is if DELETEs are disabled on the particular table it is trying to clean up. p  pI want to test the alerts to make sure they work and look correct by having the process fail. If I temporarily exclusively lock the table, will that disable DELETEs and cause the procedure that deletes records to fail Or does it only disable DDL operations Is there a better way to do this p

Negative 72 pI am using the codedoParallelcode package to parallelize jobs across multiple Linux machines using the following syntaxp  pcodecl lt makePSOCKclustermachines, outfile  , master  systemhostname i, intern  Tcodep  pTypically each job would take less than 10 minutes to run on a single machine. However, sometimes there would be one worker process that would run away and kept running for hours and never returned to the main driver process. I can see the process running using codetopcode, but it seems like the process is somehow stuck rather than running anything for real. The codeoutfilecode option doesnt produce anything useful since the worker process never really failed.p  pThis happens rather frequently but very randomly. Sometimes I could just restart the jobs and they would finish fine. Therefore, I cannot provide a reproducible example. Does anyone have general suggestions on how to investigate this issue Or what to look for when this happens again in the futurep  pEDITp  pAdding more details in response to the comments. I am running thousands of small simulations on 10 machines. IO and memory usage are both minimal. I have noticed the worker process running away on different machines at random without any pattern, not necessarily the busiest ones. I dont have permission to view the system log, but based on CPURAM history there doesnt seem to be anything unusual.p  pIt happens frequently enough that its fairly easy to catch a runaway process in action. codetopcode would show that the process is running with close to 100 CPU with status codeRcode, so it is definitely running and not waiting. But I am also quite sure that each simulation should only take minutes, and somehow the runaway worker just keeps running nonstop. p  pSo far codedoParallelcode is the only package I have tried. I am exploring other options, but its hard to make an informed decision without knowing the cause.p

Negative 72 pIm using filepicker.io with a Meteor application and am working on security for my application. Filepicker provides support for creating and signing policies but with the server side of Meteor I feel like creating expiring policies for each user requesting a file is overkill.p  pWhat I would like to do is provide the user an indirect link to a file. The server intercepts this request with a server side route ironrouter, the server then checks if the user has permissions for the file via a Files collection with metadata about said file. p  pAs I have it now, If the user has access I would provide them a file link with the signature and policy as parameters to that link.

Negative 72 pI need to pass a string from a NSObject class to a UIViewController, I understand that the best way is delegation but the delegate method isnt being called.

If I addp  pcell.backgroundImage  imagep  pthere, then it fixes the issue where sometimes the image will not display on the table view cell. So far the only cause I have found for this is that the image is being returned faster than I can return the table view cell so that is why the table view says there is not a cell at that index path.p  pBut if I add that code there, then I run into another issue Cells will display the wrong images and then it lags down the app and the image will constantly switch, or even just stay on the wrong image.p  pI have checked that it runs on the main thread, image downloading and caching is all fine. It just has to do that the table is saying there is no cell at that index path, and I have tried getting an indexPath for the cell which returns also nil.p  pA semisolution to this problem is called tableView.reloadData in viewWillAppearviewDidAppear. This will fix the issue, but then I lose the animation for table view cells on screen. p  pEDITp  pIf I pass the image view into getImageForShow and set it directly it will fix this issue, but that is less ideal design of code. The image view obviously exists, the cell exists, but for some reason it doesnt want to work every time. p

Negative 72 pFor those who remember or still use Windows XP, you might remember that you could launch the start bar with your Windows key on your keyboard and then hit the letter of the programfolderfile you wanted and as long as there wasnt another programfolderfile on the start bar starting with the same letter, itd launch right away. e.g. If you wanted to open excel, youd hit the windows key and press the letter e and excel would launch.p  pSo, for those who do remember that feature, Im wondering, is there any way to get that functionality back in Windows 8.1 Right now, what happens is that when you hit the windows key, Metro pops up which is fine but if you type e, for example, windows will automatically start searching instead of just launching Excel or whatever letter youve typed.p  pId rather keep the interface as it is and, if possible, prefer not to install any 3rd party software unless theres no other go. My preference is to be able to utilize the OS to get that option if available, even if that includes going through regedit. p  pJust a note, I am already aware that 8.1 and XP are completely different architectures and I also realize that automatic searching does have its benefits but I prefer that specific XP functionality so itd be great if I could get it back in 8.1.p  pThanks in advance for your help.p  hr
