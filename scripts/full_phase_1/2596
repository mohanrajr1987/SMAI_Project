Positive 2596 pI wrote a windows service that is supposed to copy a file from a UNC path to the local hard drive using FileCopy and File.Exists. This service works fine when is not on a UNC path but for some reason when the file that needs to be found and copied is on a UNC path it does not work. I tried exactly the same code on a regular winforms application and the code works with no issues. I am running this service with administrator privileges so I believe this is not a permission issue neither a string path issue since the same code works with no issues on a winform application.p  pThank you in advanced.p

Positive 2596 pI have a weird problem where after around 30 seconds after a local html page has finished loading, calling the google AutocompleteService or PlacesService javascript function does not send out a request to do the lookup.

Positive 2596 pFirst off, Id like to say that Ive used StackOverflow for years, and this is the first time I havent found an existing answer.  A testament to what a valuable resource this is.p  pBackground Im trying to catch MIDI input from a connected device and have it trigger keyboard events to whichever window has focus.  I was able to do this successfully using SendInput in a Windows Console application, but would prefer to run this as a service.  I was able to hide the console window and have it work, which is a passable solution, but I would prefer to get it working without seeing the console for a second before it hides.p  pThe problem After doing some research on making a Windows Service, primarily using the following sources p  pa hrefhttpscode.msdn.microsoft.comwindowsappsCppWindowsServicecacf4948 relnofollowMSDN Windows Service Tutoriala p  pa hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles499465SimpleWindowsServiceinCplusplus relnofollowCodeProject Windows Service Tutoriala p  pI got the impression that there might be security restrictions that prevent SendInput from working in a Windows Service and understandably so.  I decided to try a proof of concept first before getting too far to see if I could get it to work.  I ran the sample code from MSDN and was able to get it to install and work as described in the tutorial.  After doing so, I added the following code to their example in the class SampleService.cppp  precode    while mfStopping       Perform main service function here...     INPUT keyEvents     keyEvents.type  INPUTKEYBOARD     keyEvents.ki.wScan  0     keyEvents.ki.time  0     keyEvents.ki.dwExtraInfo  0      keyEvents.ki.wVk  0x41     keyEvents.ki.dwFlags  0     SendInput1, ampkeyEvents, sizeofINPUT     Sleep5000   Simulate some lengthy operations.  codepre  pI did not change any other code.  After I installed the service, I found it listed in Services, and before starting it, I went into Properties, to the Logon tab, and set Logon to Local System Account and checked Allow Service to Interact with Desktop.  When running the service I dont see the lower case a I expect in any window that accepts text.p  pIs it possible to use SendInput in a service  If so, how  If not, is there another way to have a service send key events to any active windowp  pIm using Windows 8 64bit, IDE is VS2012 Professional.p

Positive 2596 pWe have an application that can run as a Windows service or as a user mode app.  As part of its processing, it launches a second executable that interacts with MAPI to read the contents of an MSG file.

Positive 2596 pI am migrating an old C Windows Service that hosts COM objects. I managed to create a .Net Windows Service and a COM visible Serviced Component, but only in separate projects.p  pWhat I need is for our legacy applications to be able to create instances of my new objects via COM interface these objects shall be hosted in a Windows Service process that can be managed from the Services administration tool started, delay started, paused, resumed, stopped. There are other reasons why it must be a Windows Servicep  ul liThere must be only one systemwide instance of its process at any given time.li liIt must be longlived, because it holds static data and performs background processing on it.li liIt should be active before the first COM object is instantiated.li liIt should be automatically started by the first COM object is instantiated should it be stopped at that time for any reason.li liObject instances will run within the service process.li liRuns with the Network Service identity.li liClients will not be upgraded  modified.li ul  pAll these points were nicely covered by the old COM Service construct from Visual C 6.0, but with VB.Net Framework 4 I dont know how to do it.p  pPerhaps I could merge the .Net Windows Service and the Serviced Component somehow, or there might be other ways to expose classes in my Windows Service.p  pEDITp  pI forgot to mention one important reason I need it to be a standard Windows Service It must be able to perform some rather lengthy tasks when it is going to be stopped. Clients will entrust the COM objects with tasks to be performed in background. If the service is stopped prematurely, some of these tasks will be left undone. Its OK as long as the service can perform some cleanup procedures inserts, updates, etc. which might take anywhere from none to ten or more seconds. It doesnt need to be bullet proof it wont but a normal system shut down or a maintenance service stop must not leave unkept things behind.p

Negative 2596 pSo basically, I have two tabs which contain regular and special emails. In order to get emails, you have to click on a calendar date and AJAX will then query the database for the regular emails and special emails. There is a next and previous button to navigate through the results gotten for the selected date. The problem I have is that since each tab keeps track of a separate set of emails, email count, viewing email emnem of emnem, and current email.p  pMy thought was that I could use setters and getters for each common variable. Basically, if I called emgetEmailCountem while in the first tab, Ill get the email count for the regular emails by checking which tab is currently active. Only reason I ask is because I dont think have checking which tab is active in each function is the best way. I Googled it a bit, but really didnt know what I should have been searching for.p  pEdit The AJAX requests only gets called whenever the user select a new date on the calendar. If there are results, the emails get stored in separate arrays. And if there are no results, nothing happens. As for the behavior of the tabs, its quite simple. The tabs sole responsibility is to display the email info in HTML tables. The next and previous buttons are used to navigate through the emails.p  pAny thoughtsp  pThank you.p

Negative 2596 pIn my ASP.Net app, which is javascript and jQuery heavy, but also uses master pages and .Net Ajax pieces, I am consistently seeing on the status bar of IE 6 and occasionally IE 7 the message 2 items remaining or 15 items remaining followed by loading emsomegraphicsfile.pnggifem . This message never goes away and may or may not prevent some page functionality from running it certainly seems to bog down, but Im not positive.p  pI can cause this to happen 99 of the time by just refreshing an .aspx age, but the number of items and, sometimes, the file it mentions varies. Usually it is 2, 3, 12, 13, or 15.p  pIve Googled for answers and there are several suggestions or explanations. Some of them havent worked for us, and others arent practical for us to implement or try.p  pHere are some of the ideastheoriesp  ul lipIE isnt caching images right, so it repeatedly asks for the same image if the image is repeated on the page and the server assumes that it should be cached locally since its already served it in that page context. IE displays the images correctly, but sits and waits for a server response that never comes. Typically the file it says it is waiting on is repeated on the page.pli lipThe page is using PNG graphics with transparency. Indeed it is, but they are jQueryUI Themeroller generated graphics which, according to the jQueryUI folks, are IE safe. The jQueryUI components are the only things using PNGs. All of our PNG references are in CSS, if that helps. Ive changed some of the graphics from PNG to GIF, but it is just as likely to say its waiting for emsomegraphicsfile.pngem as it is for emsomegraphicsfile.gifem pli lipImages are being specified in CSS andor JavaScript but are on things that arent currently being displayed display none items for example. This emmayem be true, but if it is, then I would think preloading images would work, but so far, adding a preloader doesnt do any good.pli lipIISs caching policy is confusing the browser. If this is true, it is only Microsoft server SW having problems with Microsofts browser which doesnt surprise me at all. Unfortunately, I dont have much control over the IIS configuration that will be hosting the app.pli ul  pHas anyone seen this and found a way to combat it Particularly on ASP.Net apps with jQuery and jQueryUIp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pOne other data point on at least one of the pages, just commenting out the jQueryUI Datepicker component setup causes the problem to go away, but I dont think or at least Im not sure if that fixes all of the pages. If it does fix them, Ill have to swap out plugins because that functionality needs to be there. There doesnt seem to be any open issues against jQueryUI on IE67 currently...p  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pI checked the IIS settings and enable content expiration was emnotem set on any of my folders. Unchecking that setting was a common suggestion for fixing this problem.p  pI have another, simpler, page that I can consistently create the error on. Im using the jQueryUI 1.6rc6 file although Ive also tried jQueryUI 1.7.1 with the same results. The problem only occurs when I refresh the page that contains the jQueryUI Datepicker. If I comment out the Datepicker setup, the problem goes away. Here are a few things I notice when I do thisp  ol liThis page always says 1 item remaining Downloading picture httpimagesCalendarscheduleHS.gif, but only when reloading.li liWhen I look at HTTP logging, I see that it requests that image from the server every time it is dynamically turned on, without regard to caching.li liAll of the requests for that graphic are complete and return the graphic correctly. None are marked code 200 or 304 indicating that the server is telling IE to use the cached version. Why it says waiting on that graphic when all of the requests have completed I have no idea.li liThere is a single other graphic on the page one of the UI PNG files that has a code 304 Not Modified. On another page where I managed to log HTTP traffic with 2 items remaining, two different graphic files both UI PNGs had a 304 as well but neither was the one listed as Downloading.li liThis error is not innocuous  the page is not fully responsive. For example, if I click on one of the buttons which should execute a clientside action, the page refreshes.li liGoing away from the page and coming back does not produce the error.li liI have moved the script and script references to the bottom of the content and this doesnt affect this problem. The script is still running in the document.ready though its too hairy to divide out unless I absolutely have to.li ol  pstrongFINAL UPDATE AND ANSWERstrongp  pThere were a lot of good answers and suggestions below, but none of them were exactly our problem. The closest one and the one that led me to the solution was the one about long running JavaScript, so I awarded the bounty there I guess I could have answered it myself, but Id rather reward info that leads to solutions.p  pHere was our solution We had multiple jQueryUI datepickers that were created on the document.ready event in script included from the ASP.Net master page. On this client page, a local scripts document.ready event had script that destroyed the datepickers under certain conditions. We had to use destroy because the previous version of datepicker had a problem with disable. When we upgraded to the latest version of jQuery UI 1.7.1 and replaced the destroys with disables for the datepickers, the problem went away or mostly went away  if you do things too fast while the page is loading, it is still possible to get the n items remaining status.p  pMy theory as to what was happening goes like thisp  ol liThe page content loads and has 12 or so text boxes with the datepicker class.li liThe master page script creates datepickers on those text boxes.li liIE queues up requests for each calendar graphic independently because IE doesnt know how to properly cache dynamic image requests.li liBefore the requests get processed, the client area script destroys those datepickers so the graphics are no longer needed.li liIE is left with some number of orphaned requests that it doesnt know what to do with.li ol

Negative 2596 pI got assigned to work on some performance and random crashing issues of a multithreaded java server. Even though threads and threadsafety are not really new topics for me, I found out designing a new multithreaded application is probably half as difficult as trying to tweak some legacy code. I skimmed through some well known books in search of answers, but the weird thing is, as long as I read about it and analyze the examples provided, everything seems clear. However, the second I look at the code Im supposed to work on, Im no longer sure about anything Must be too much of theoretical knowledge and little realworld experience or something. p  pAnyway, getting back on topic, as I was doing some online research, I came across a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions511552readingfromasocketnotwaitingforinputstrongthis piece of codestronga. The question which keeps bothering me is strongIs it really safe to invoke getInputStream and getOutputStream on the socket from two separate threads without synchronizationstrong Or am I now getting a bit too paranoid about the whole threadsafety issue Guess thats what happens when like the 5th book in a row tells you how many things can possibly go wrong with concurrency.p  pPS. Sorry if the question is a bit lengthy or maybe too noobie, please be easy on me  thats my first post here.p  pstrongEditstrong Just to be clear, I know sockets work in fullduplex mode and its safe to concurrently use their input and output streams. Seems fine to me when you acquire those references in the main thread and then initialize thread objects with those, but is it also safe to emgetem those streams in two different threadsp  pstrongrspstrong p  pSo Ive checked Suns code and codePlainSocketImplcode does synchronize on those two methods, just as you said. codeSocketcode, however, doesnt. codegetInputStreamcode and codegetOutputStreamcode are pretty much just wrappers for codeSocketImplcode, so emprobablyem concurrency issues wouldnt cause the whole server to explode. Still, with a bit of unlucky timing, seems like things emcouldem go wrong e.g. when some other thread closes the socket when the method already checked for error conditions. p  pAs you pointed out, from a code structure standpoint, it would be a good idea to supply each thread with a stream reference instead of a whole socket. I wouldve probably already restructured the code Im working on if not for the fact that each thread also uses sockets codeclosecode method e.g. when the socket receives shutdown command. As far as I can tell, the main purpose of those threads is to queue messages for sending or for processing, so maybe its a Single Responsibility Principle violation and those threads shouldnt be able to close the socket compare with a hrefhttpwww.objectmentor.comresourcesarticlessrp.pdf relnofollowSeparated Modem Interfacea But then if I keep analysing the code for too long, it appears the design is generally flawed and the whole thing requires rewriting. Even if the management was willing to pay the price, seriously refactoring legacy code, having no unit tests what so ever and dealing with a hard to debug concurrency issues, would probably do more harm than good.

If BackColor is set from the PagePanelBase constructor InitializeComponent called from there, the CameraParameters constructor hasnt been called yet, so we get a null pointer dereference  the standard dont call virtual methods from the constructor problem.  p  pNow how can we solve this issue We NEED to use this hierarchy, and we NEED to set the background color from the base class. At present, each deriving class uses a boolean variable isInitialized that is set in InitializeComponent, and every overridden method calls InitializeComponent if necessary before doing anything. Is there a better way of doing this There are already enough broken windows in the code...p
Negative 2596 pI am working in a small law firm and my boss has asked me to put a database together to help with outgoing mail.  There are 5 different tables that exist in Access. Applicants, Attorneys, Lien Claimants, Employers and Workers Compensation Boards  All of the tables include addresses only.  Each Applicant has an attorney, one or possibly more lien claimants, employer and designated board.  I need to create some type of database that will allow me to create a mail merge for all applicants. Keep in mind each applicant has different addresses, employers, etc..There are roughly 500 applicants  I need to create the database so when I changeupdate an address on the table in Access it will change ALL of the applicants it pertains to.  Tryin to only update a new address in one place instead of 50. If anyone can help please let me know. I am looking for the most efficient and effective way of doing this.p

Negative 2596 pMost of the documentation regarding type erasure handling in Java assumes that the use case is handling a type like codeSomeTypeltParamTypegtcode. I am trying to process method parameter for the following methodp  precodepublic void setOtherReferenceRangesListltReferenceRangeltTgtgt referenceRanges codepre  pWhen the container class is instantiated with a type DvQuantity, this signature should become codepublic void setOtherReferenceRangesListltReferenceRangeltDvQuanititygtgt referenceRangescode in runtime. p  pUsing reflection one can see that the codeListcode has an codeactualTypeArgumentcode which is codeReferenceRangeltTgtcode. Since reflection uses class information, I would not expect it to give me codeReferenceRangeltDvQuantitygtcode.  However, when I created the class containing this method, I passed the codeDvQuantitycode type as codeTcode.

Negative 2596 pA lot of web sites these days have an option to let the user increase or decrease the size of the font that appears on the site.  Id like to add similar functionality to my Java Swing app, with an option to change the font to either a larger size or revert to standard size.  The user would be able to do this at runtime, via a menu item.p  pThe current version of my code isnt working very well  the code iterates over the keys stored in UIManagerUIDefaults, and for each key thats a Font, my code derives a new font with the target point size e.g., if its larger, then the new point size is usually 16 otherwise, if going to regular size, its usually 11, and then puts that key and new font in UIManager.  Afterwards, the code calls SwingUtilities.updateComponentTreeUI on the frame, and then packs the frame.p  pThe code will increase the font once, but switching back to regular size has no effect. This is especially noticeable with the menu bar.p  pAm I going about this the right way  Should I instead create a new look and feel with the larger point size, or use some other method entirelyp  pThanks in advance for any help.p

Negative 2596 pThe title is hardly understandable, but Im not sure how to summarize that another way. Any edit to clarify is welcome.p  pI have been told, and recommended to use interfaces to improve performances, even in a case which doesnt especially call for the regular interface role. In this case, the objects are big models in a MVC meaning, with many methods and fields.p  pThe good use that has been recommended to me is to create an interface, with its unique implementation. There wont be any other class implementing this interface, for sure. I have been told that this is better to do so, because it exposes less or something close to the other classes which will use methods from this class, as these objects are referring to the object from its interface all public methods from the implementation being reproduced in the interface.p  pThis seems quite strange to me, as it seems like a C use to me with header files. There I see the point, but in Java p  pIs there really a point in making an interface for such unique implementation I would really appreciate some clarifications on the topic, so I could justify emnotem following such kind of behavior, and the hassle it creates from duplicating all declarations.p  hr  pstrongEditstrong Thanks everybody for the answers, it was really helpful and instructive most of them, not only the accepted one. p  pThere is clearly no advantage in performance, and I now have a larger scope of the interest that can come from it depending on the situation, besides the usual OO role of the interface.p

Negative 2596 pI cant figure out the problem and want some input as to whether my Python code is incorrect, or if this is an issue or design limitation of Python XMPP library.

This is read into a Python list variable.p  pI then instantiate an XMPP client session and loop through the list of recipients and send a message to each recipient. Then sleep some time and repeat test. This is for load testing the IM client of recipients as well as IM server.

Negative 2596 pWe use a hrefhttpgitscm.comgita for most of the web applications we build in our shop, and though the applications themselves use a variety of technologies PHP, Rails, etc, we generally have a staging and production server for each site.  Typically, these servers have different sets of database credentials as well as different environmentbased configuration settings e.g. caching.  Our workflow generally involves maintaining two git branches per project master, which reflects the production server, and staging, which reflects staging. New features are developed on staging or a subbranch and are merged back to master upon completion and deployment.p  pMy question is with respect to the best way to maintain the configuration files that are branch and environmentspecific.  Ive seen the answers from similar questions a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2964120howtousegittomanageonecodebasebuthavedifferentenvironmentsherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions922411maintainingconfigurationdifferencesbetweendevandliveenvironmentsduringdeherea, and neither really satisfies.  The main two approaches seem to be a using .gitignore exclusion to leave config files outside of gits purview, or b writing reflective, environmentaware code that determines e.g. what database credentials to use based on hostname.  My problem with a is that it only allows one set of config files to exist in the codebase irrespective of the current branch, so the other environments config files get lost.  b, on the other hand, just seems to require unnecessary modification of the codebase in a way that doesnt feel related to the applications functionality.p  pIdeally, Id like a way to lock configuration files within a certain branch, so that whenever I checkout master, I get the master config files, and whenever I checkout staging, I get the staging config files.  Additionally, merging staging into master shouldnt affect the master config files in any way.  To date, weve dealt with this by having folders containing environmentspecific configuration files outside of the git root and manually moving the appropriate files into codebase when deploying, but this is of course needlessly hackish and potentially dangerous.p  pIs there any way to accomplish this using git  p  pThanks for your considerationp

Negative 2596 pIm currently putting together a multitenancy web app using MVC 3. At least 30 different Web sites will share a common codebase, and while also sharing similar underthehood functionality, they are need to look significantly different. As a consequence Im using the URL to internally separate out clients, and an overridden Razor view engine at least in terms of finding the view to automatically select either a customised view for a given action, or the default view.p  pTo help compartmentalise a complex page, any particular view will make use of several partials, usually rendered as selfcontained actions, so that generally a custom view or partial view will only have small HTML differences, helping to minimise any code specific to a clients site.p  pI hope you followed that backgroundp  pSo one HTML page might be made up of lots of little smatterings of HTML partial views, which could come from specific folders for the client, or a generalpurpose version. Im hoping to make it easier for our designer to make minor changes to a page by easily seeing emwhereem in the folder structure the bit of HTML he wants to change are.p  pMy proposal then is that each partial will be bracketed with HTML comments such asp    p Content of partial p    pObviously I could put these in manually, but thats just asking for trouble, for typos, for copied and then modified client versions not being updated with the correct URL. It should be possible to get this from some context and inject it, I think.p  pAt the same time, I need to be able to not do this for certain Actions. Eg, a partial emmightem be generating text inside a textarea, say, so the comments wouldnt be appropriate there. On the whole Im happy to put these comments in emunlessem I specify that its not appropriate.p  pFor me this suggests an ActionFilter on an Action, which I can apply site wide and then turn off for certain Actions. Id hope that one of the overridable events would let me ascertain this path, but I cant seem to find anywhere its stored. Furthermore, OnResultExecuting seems to fire before the Partial has been selected, and OnResultExecuted seems to have already written out the contents of the Partial, so I cant insert the starting comment here. I also cant find any reference to the path of the selected partial.p  pJust for completeness, its my intention that this attribute would only write these comments when compiled in Debug mode.p  pSo, does anyone know how I might be able to get the path to the selected View without any kind of hack between FindPartialView and the Attribute Is my Attribute method the best choice or is there an easier way to do this Perhaps somethings built in alreadyp  pMany thanks for your help.p

Negative 2596 pIm using TouchJSON to parse the output of a JSON Rails API, but am having difficulties. The overall goal is to loop through the response, parse the JSON, create a codeRoundcode instance for each JSON object, and stick those codeRoundcode objects into an NSArray so I can load this into a codeUITableViewcode. So if theres a more straightforward way to do that than what Im about to show which currently is NOT working, btw please let me know.p  pThe Rails API is returning a collection that looks something like thisp  precode[         round  coursetitle Title A, result 8    ,         round  coursetitle Title B, result 4    ,   ... ] codepre  pIm also using ASIHTTPRequest and I can successfully get the response usingp  precodeNSString responseString  [request responseString] codepre  pBut from there, I cannot seem to get anywhere.

NSLogJSON , dictionary  JSON null codepre  pI thought from there I would be able to loop through the dictionary and create the object mappings using my codeRoundcode class. But maybe thats the wrong approach altogether.p  pMy thoughts are that the JSON being returned from Rails is an array of JSON objects, so maybe thats why the JSON parser doesnt recognize it as valid JSON From this, I have two questionsp  p1 Should TouchJSON be able to accept an array of JSON objects like what my API is returningp  p2 Is it possible to cast the responseString to an NSArray so I can loop through each round and parse the JSON that way If I remove the first and last characters from the response string i.e. [ and ] the JSON parser will only grab the first round in the collection.p  p3 Am I going about this whole process correctlyp  pAny tipsadvice would be much appreciated.p

Negative 2596 pI stumbled across a very interesting problem, I might say. I am developing a method which will help me validate forms with jQuery in CakePHP. A generalized method, I might say. So, instead of having a separate event for each form, I will have a general event which will handle all forms. But the problem is how can I fetch the URL to which I need to send the data to be validated In a very simple way, I could use the forms action, but with complex routing, it is useless.p  pSo what will be the best way to validate data Have a separate function to handle each form, or a generalized function to handle all forms and also how to get the URL to which the data should be sentp  pThank you very muchp

Negative 2596 pI am using the jquery datatables plugin on a project using server side processing to populate the data table  using servlets . I am also using jquery ui layout plugin so I am trying to tie resizing of a pane to readjust the column sizing of the table on call back.

Negative 2596 pHi everybody at stackoverflowp  pIm developing a C Windows Forms Application using .NET 4 and I am facing a very interesting requirement. What happens is that Id like to have two kinds of OpenFileDialogSaveFileDialog the default ones from Windows API and custom ones with special features that suits my business scenario. Depending on a business rule, the default dialog or the custom dialog should be shown.p  pI already have my custom Open and SaveFileDialogs. The tricky thing is that I cant simply implement the logic to call one or another, instead I need to hook somehow the OpenFileDialog.ShowDialog and SaveFileDialog.ShowDialog calls on application level so that it shows the default or the custom dialog.p  pI need it like this because Im also using thirdparty controls DevExpress, for example and I need that when any of the DevExpress controls calls OpenFileDialog or SaveFileDialog, the same business rule should be applied to define if the default or custom dialog will be shown.p  pSo, everytime that anyone in my application scope calls OpenFileDialog or SaveFileDialog, this business rule should be triggered to find out the correct dialog to show default one or custom one.p  pI already searched a lot in stackoverflow and also Googled it a lot, but, couldnt find a clear way of doing it.p  pHas anybody ever needed to implement something like thisp  pThank you very much in advancep  pRegards,p  pAndr Limap

Negative 2596 pBasically the function I am exploiting is thisp  precodeint getbufn       char buf[512]      Getsbuf      return 1  codepre  pWhen I run the main program the function executes 5 times and each time the location of buf changes and so does the location of ebp. What I am supposed to do is place a specific hex value, lets say 0xFFFFFFFF, into a variable and the main program checks each time to see if that variable is there. If it is it executes again until all 5 times are done and the program exits quietly. p  pThe problem I am having is that right before the check for the hex value there is a check for another value that is constant, lets say 0x12345678. If I have corrupted 0x12345678 and its not there, the program explodes on me. p  pI have figured out that 0x12345678 is stored in 0x10ebp so I know it is based off ebp and I know the address of ebp each time but I can only get the exploit to work the first time. I do this by basically nopsleding 496 bytes and the having this machine code in byte formatp  precodemov  0xFFFFFFFF, eax movl address old ebp, ebp push correct return adress in function main ret codepre  pwhich ends up being 5 words and a byte for return long which I fill with 0x313131 to make it 6 words long. At this point my exploit string is 520 bytes long which is exactly how much the buffer is below ebp and so I add on the address of old ebp and an address somewhere inside my nopsled overwriting the current value at ebp as well as the return address for getbufn.p  pThe problem is when the program executes a 2nd time ebp is in an address 0x10 lower than its previous address so my way of uncorrupting ebp doesnt work and main detects that 0x12345678 is not at 0x10ebp. How do I uncorrupt ebpp

Negative 2596 pWe are developing an 3tier application where presentation layer communicates with service layer, which in turn communicates with the business layer. The business layer has access to database. Currently we have implemented business layer to hold CRUD operations for tables.  We have a couple of doubts regarding organizing the methods in service layer and business layer. p  ul lipFirstly, how should the methods at service layer be grouped Should we group the methods based on a page basis, where in all the data a page needs are provided by a method of a service. Or should we fetch the page data by multiple service calls pli lipThe other concern is about organizing methods at the business layer, it seems that for any method at the service layer we have to implement a corresponding method at business layer. If we go by this logic the methods at service layer would be acting like dummies, and only taking care of authorization and validation. For ex when fetching a data that comes from join of two table, should we fetch the two tables on the service layer and then do the join on the service layer or should we have a function on business layer which does the same thing. Essentially reducing the data transfer between service layer and business layer. pli ul

Theose about a hrefquestionstaggedsdl classposttag titleshow questions tagged sdl reltagsdla are mainly using a hrefquestionstaggedopengl classposttag titleshow questions tagged opengl reltagopengla 1.x, those about OpenGL 2.0 are not about texturing, or SDL. p  pThe code is a hrefhttpsgithub.comPitelColorLUT relnofollowherea. Everything is in codecolorLUT.ccode, and fragment shader is in codecolorLUT.fscode. The result is window of the same size as image, and if you comment the last line in shader, you get nice redgreen gradient, so the shader is fine.p

Negative 2596 pI am writing code intended to work both under ARC and under Garbage Collection.p  pHeres a bit of code that uses Core Foundation as it might be written specifically for ARCp  precodeCFTypeRef refCFCopySomething  At this point ref has retain count 1. id objbridgetransfer idref  Ref still has retain count 1 but is now managed by ARC. [obj doSomething]  ARC will release ref when done. codepre  pIt seems this is equivalent top  precodeCFTypeRef refCFCopySomething  At this point ref has retain count 1. id objbridge idref  Now ref has retain count 2 due to assigning to strong variable under ARC. CFReleaseref  Now ref has retain count 1. [obj doSomething]  ARC will release ref when done. codepre  pThe benefit of the latter being that the CFRelease call allows the GC to collect the object. But Im not sure about calling the CFRelease after transferring to ARC with the bridgecasted assignment.p  pIt certainly seems to work. Is this code OKp
Negative 2596 pI am currently using the ManualResetEvent for a single thread to wait for multiple thread to add something to the queue of a thread manager.

Negative 2596 pI have a function which takes three argumentsp  precodevoid replaceconst string, const string, string  codepre  pMy problem is the second argument which Id like to rewrite so it can be either a string or a Path object from the Boost Filesystem library, but really any object that can be treated as a string should do so I dont have to convert paths to strings all over the place. p  pI know I can overload the function and make two implementations, thats what I do now so I have two implementations of the same functionp  precodevoid replaceconst string, const string, string  void replaceconst string, const path, string  codepre  pBut that doesnt seem very elegant, even if the second one just converts the path to a string and calls the first so not much code duplication. Ive tried using templates instead, like thisp  precodetemplate ltclass Tgt void replaceconst string, const T, string  codepre  pBut the implementation of the function requires that it is a string, so if it is given a path it needs to be converted to a string within the function, which Im not sure how to do or if its even a good thing to do.p  pTo further complicate matters, in the future I might want to expand the function so it can also take a set of strings or a set of paths instead of just one stringpath as the second argument. p  pWhat is the best way to handle all this Is there no better way than having more than one implementation of the same functionp

Negative 2596 pHere is the situation. Im creating an Android that utilises Bluetooth to update connected clients of each others status. The idea is for the host of the Bluetooth connection to hold a multidimensional array holding all of these stats. Each time a client updates the host of their new status, the host then update the data in the array and then sends this to all the clients.p  pOf course, this all sounds like milk and cookies to me, but unfortunately it is not. I understand that I need to have a Bluetooth socket on each end and one of them needs to be a host socket. So, get one connection done seems pretty straight forward. But what if I then want to accept more connections Ive been reading around and apparently I have to create a new thread for each connection. I dont see how that would work, could someone please explain thisp

Negative 2596 pNote that all the code is a simplified example in order to only communicate the core ideas of my question. It should all compile and run though, after slight editing.p  pI have several classes which all implement a common interface.p  precodepublic interface Inter public class Inter1 implements Inter public class Inter2 implements Inter codepre  pIn a separate class I have a list of type Inter, which I use to store and remove Inter1 and Inter2 types, based on user input.p  precodejava.util.ArrayListltIntergt inters  new java.util.ArrayListltIntergt codepre  pI also have a family of overloaded methods, which deal with how each implementation interacts with each other, along with a default implementation for 2 Inters.p  precodevoid doSomethingInter in1, Inter in2     System.out.printlnInterInter       void doSomethingInter1 in1, Inter1 in2     System.out.printlnInter1Inter11      void doSomethingInter2 in1, Inter1 in2     System.out.printlnInter2Inter1      codepre  pThe methods are periodically called like sop  precodeforint i  0 i lt inters.size  1 i     forint o  i1 o lt inters.size o         Inter in1  inters.geti    Inter in2  inters.geto          doSomethingin1.getClass.castin1, in2.getClass.castin2          System.out.printlnClass 1   in1.getClass.getName         System.out.printlnClass 2   in2.getClass.getName       codepre  pAn example output from this isp  precodeInterInter Class 1 Inter Class 2 Inter InterInter Class 1 Inter Class 2 Inter1 InterInter Class 1 Inter1 Class 2 Inter1 codepre  pLooking at the output, it is clear that doSomethingInter in1, Inter in2 is called, even in cases when other methods should be called. Interestingly, the class names outputted are the correct ones. p  pWhy does java have static method overloading when the class types are determined at runtime using reflection Is there any way to get Java to do this I know I can use reflection and Class.getMethod and method.invoke to get the results I want, but it would be so much neater to do so with casting.p  pI realize that questions about similar concepts have been asked before, but while all of the answers were informative, none satisfied me. Double dispatch looked like it would work, but that would mean reworking a lot of code, since I use this type of thing often. p

Negative 2596 pSo, about two or three hours ago, I was successful working on and able to deploy my app engine app from Eclipse to App Engine. Up until about an hour ago, however, I have been unable to do so. In Eclipse, when I attempted and failed the first time to deploy the app, the progress froze at 20something Precompiling... for about 10 minutes returning an error telling me to disable precompiling in appengineweb.xml, which I did. Then, after another attempt, it froze for about 10 minutes on the step immediately before when precompiling would happen Cloning Application files, returning a 500 server error from app engine. I tried with another app engine project I have deployed successfully today and it failed the same way.p  pTo see what was going wrong, I attempted to login to the admin panel on appengine.google.com, but when I clicked one of my apps in My Applications it took about 1 minute to load and gave me a 403 error. When I went back to try again, it took 2 minutes to load and gave me a Server error which I assume would be a 500 server error but it didnt say, just black text and a link to report.

Negative 2596 pPythonistas,p  pIm trying to write a Python extension in C that passes a big amount of null terminated, UNICODE UTF16 encoded C strings to my Python application. The UNICODE strings from my C library are guarenteed to be always 16 bit. Im NOT using the wchart in my C library on LINUX due to the fact that the size of wchart may vary.p  pI found a lot of functions PyUnicodeAsUTF8String, PyStringFromStringAndSize, PyStringFromString, etc. that do exactly what i want but all theses functions are designed for 8 bit characterstring representation.p  pThe Python documentation httpdocs.python.orghowtounicode.html saysp  blockquote   pUnder the hood, Python represents Unicode strings as either 16 or   32bit integers, depending on how the Python interpreter was   compiled.p blockquote  pIm really keen to avoid the performance penalty of converting all my UTF16 C strings to UTF8 C strings only for Python interface purposes, especially on Windows if the Python interpreter uses 16 bit under the hood as well. p  pAny idea how to tackle this challenge is highly appreciated.p  pThanks, Thomasp

I debugged it and its just blank, as if when I make the call to the server from the other application it erases the current values in the php service.p  pCode for placing the coordinates in application onep  precodepublic void postDataString longCord, String latCord throws JSONException        Create a new HttpClient and Post Header     HttpClient httpclient  new DefaultHttpClient     HttpPost httppost  new HttpPost...androidserverFile.php     JSONObject json  new JSONObject      try           JSON data         json.putlongitude, longCord         json.putlatitude, latCord         JSONArray postjsonnew JSONArray         postjson.putjson           Post the data         httppost.setHeaderjson,json.toString         httppost.getParams.setParameterjsonpost,postjson          Execute HTTP Post Request         System.out.printjson         HttpResponse response  httpclient.executehttppost           for JSON         ifresponse  null                       InputStream is  response.getEntity.getContent             BufferedReader reader  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReaderis             StringBuilder sb  new StringBuilder             String line  null             try                  while line  reader.readLine  null                      sb.appendline  n                               catch IOException e                  e.printStackTrace              finally                  try                      is.close                  catch IOException e                      e.printStackTrace                                                                   JSONObject jsonObj  new JSONObjectjsonStr                  grabbing the menu object                  String longitudecord  jsonObj.getStringlon                 String latitudecord  jsonObj.getStringlat                  Toast.makeText getApplicationContext,longitudecord,Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show                 Toast.makeText getApplicationContext,latitudecord,Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show               catch ClientProtocolException e           TODO Autogenerated catch block      catch IOException e           TODO Autogenerated catch block       codepre  pphp filep  precodeltphp json  SERVER[HTTPJSON] data  jsondecodejson lon  datagtlongitude lat  datagtlatitude variable  array lon gt lon, lat gt lat   One JSON for both variables echo jsonencodevariable codepre  pp  pNow when I run this code on the other application...Its the same as above minus posting the coordinates...I get lon and lat.

Negative 2596 pI want to strongfind all the required fieldsstrong on my form that are strongwithinstrong a fieldset that is strongcurrently visiblestrong.  I will actually use this code when the user submits the form, but for testing I am using a simple button to check for visible fieldset, then for the fields within those visible fieldset that are required [strongnoted by the class name ending with requiredstrong].  These fields can be textboxes, radios, checkboxes, etc.  Then determine if they are empty.  If empty provide message in my div telling user which fields are not complete.br I thought I had this code figured out with help from another stackOverflower, but it just does not work in my code.

Negative 2596 pWhat criteria do you use to decide whether or not to nest resourcesp  pIn the past, I have chosen to nest when the index action on a resource makes no sense without scoping to an associated resource the parent.p  pEven as I write the above criteria, I realize it is ambiguous at best.p  pA colleague has stated p  blockquote   pNest resources because it captures the relationship of the associated models visually in the url structure...  And it makes it easy to modify the url to get back to just the post.  If I see posts123offers555   I know that I can go to posts123 to see my post.   Where as if I just saw offers555, Id have no way to get back to the post other than manually navigating through the site.p blockquote  pTo me, manipulation of the url by users should have no bearing on the architecture of the application, and flies against what I understand to be the generally held principle that nested resources should be avoided if at all possible. Additionally, this argument would seem to support multiple levels of nesting, which again, pretty much every article I read advises against.p  pWhat has been your experiencep

Negative 2596 pPlease forgive me for what may sound like a newbie question as I am just getting started with Android.p  pWhat I am attempting to accomplish is creating a custom list Item layout that contains 2 textViews and a checkbox for selecting multiple items. The problem is the checkboxes are extra selecting list items, example if I select 1 then 9 and  18 selects as well. as if the checkBox instances are recycling themselves or maybe sharing the same listener IDs if that even makes sense. Ive narrowed my code to the primary components for simplicity.

I have the ability to convert the files with a long forgotten and similarly poorly documented utility, but it is a time intensive and tedious process which I would like to automate.p  pSimply using a hex editor Ive been able to find everything I need except for how the date and time is encoded in the original files. Im confident that Ive identified the 27 byte hex sequence that represents the data Im after as I can edit it to change the date and insert it into another file to transfer the date. However, I want to understand how it is actually generated so I can covert files with unknown dates. p  pBelow is a sample of the hex sequences left and the time stamps they result in the converted file right in the format DD.MM.YYHH.MM.SS. Some are taken directly from files generated by the software, others are sequences Ive manually edited to see how the date is changed. Anything with a year 12 was the result of my modifying the hex.

Negative 2596 pAre there any drawbacks to having a symbol with external linkage other then global namespace cluttercollision For instance, I would think that if I have a function witch I never call, if it has internal linkage, the compiler can just discard it, but if it is external the compiler has to leave that code in because someone might link to it later. Is this correct Are there any other drawbacksp  pI am asking because I know unnamed namespaces are recommended instead of the static keyword, but since symbols in an unnamed namespace still have external linkage, they would suffer from the above mentioned drawback if I am right about it, and so are not totally better than static functions like the standard says.p

In release it happens even on my local machine in the IDE. I have tried fiddling with the settings likep  ul liDisable all optimizationsli liGenerate fastest code possibleli liExternal type filesli liand so onli ul  pcleaning the build between each try. But the ICE does not go away. I did however manage to make it complain about another spot in another file. Setting the settings back to how they were before does NOT make the error go back to the strongFrontEnd.cppstrong file. This compiler feels kinda shaky p  pIn fact I started getting ICEs all over the code and had to restart the IDE to be able to compile anything at all.p

I am trying to implement F1 help in a WPF dialog box that gets invoked from the MFC main window.p  pInitially I added a codeKeyBindingcode to the WPF dialog for F1, and had it fire a command that runs codeHtmlHelpcode something like thisp  precodeltWindow.Resourcesgt     ltcommandCommandReference xKeyShowF1Help CommandBinding ShowHelpCommandgt ltWindow.Resourcesgt  ltWindow.InputBindingsgt     ltKeyBinding xNameShowHelp GestureF1 CommandStaticResource ShowF1Helpgt ltWindow.InputBindingsgt codepre  pThis brought up Help, but unfortunately the keyboard event was emalsoem picked up by the MFC window even though the WPF dialog was modally displayed on top of it, the MFC window still received F1 and so it launched codeHtmlHelpcode a second time, showing its own topic.p  pI searched for a way to mark the event as handled within the codeXAMLKeyBindingcode element but had no luck. So I tried to bruteforce it and replaced that with a codeKeyDowncode handler in the codebehind, marking the event as handled, like thisp  precodeprivate void WindowKeyDownobject sender, KeyEventArgs e      if e.Key  Key.F1              MyDialogVM.ShowContextSensitiveHelp         e.Handled  true       codepre  pThis didnt work the event still winds up getting handled by the MFC window. I also tried codePreviewKeyDowncode same results.p  pI have a feeling that Im overlooking something obvious, but it sure looks like marking a WPF event as handled only affects WPF code, and the MFC message pump has no knowledge that the managed code has seen or handled a given keyboard event.p  pIs there a way to prevent keyboard events that are handled in a WPF dialog box from also being seen by the MFC application that invoked the dialogp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 2596 pIm trying to create a COM class with one method that will cast an object to a specific interface on behalf of VBScript.p  pThis is the method signature Im usingbr  codepublic object GetInterfaceobject unknown, string iidcodep  pI thought this would be possible because if the method explicitly declares the return type as  br  codepublic IRequestedInterface GetInterfaceobject unknown, string iidcode p  pThen VBScript gets the reference to the desired interface.p  pSo I tried just casting to the interfacebr  codereturn IRequestedInterfaceunknowncode p  pUnfortunately, VBScript gets a reference to the default interface instead of the requested interface.p  pI have tried getting round this by creating a custom marshaller using codeICustomMarshalercode.br  I thought this would work because the method codeMarshalManagedToNativecode returns a codeIntPtrcode.p  pBecause of this I thought that if i just returned the codeIntPtrcode to the interface br  codereturn Marshal.GetComInterfaceForObjectunknown, typeofIRequestedInterfacecodebr  it would work.

That might work, but I cant even get the Forms section of Contour to expand anymore because of this error.p  pIm really at a loss and Im hoping that smarter people than myself have some clue as to a different avenue I can take to resolve this.p  pThanks for you time, Jasonp

Negative 2596 pIve got a rather interesting situation. I have a SQLite database full of addresses and messages addresses are not unique messages are. Each message also has a date associated with it. What I want to do is select emthe firstem messages address, message, date, and emhow many messagesem are associated with the address.p  pSo, I thought, I can just GROUP by the address to only get one message per address, then ORDER these by the date, and also fetch the COUNT of the address column.p  pI did that, and it works... kinda. It fetches the correct count, fetches only one message per address, and orders them by datebut it does not select the emmost recentem message for the address. It appears to be arbitrary.p  pAs an example, I have three messages earliest to latest A, B, C from address Y, and three messages D, E, F from address Z. The query may fetch messages B and E, emthenem sort them by date. It emshouldem fetch messages C and F, and sort those by date.p  pHere is what I have so farp  precode Expanded version Cursor cursor  db.query      FROM  messagesdatabase,      SELECT  new String[] , COUNTaddress AS count ,      WHERE  null,      WHERE args  null,      GROUP BY  address,      HAVING  null,      ORDER BY  date DESC    Or, same code on one line Cursor cursor  db.querymessagesdatabase, new String[] , COUNTaddress AS count , null, null, address, null, date DESC codepre  pI feel like this may have to do with the codeHAVINGcode clause, but I really dont know. Ive used MySQL a lot with PHP, but never had to touch codeHAVINGcode before. I tried setting my codeHAVINGcode clause to codeMAXdatecode, but it had no effect. If I set my codeGROUP BYcode clause to be codeaddress, datecode, then they are sorted by date, but of course they are all individual instead of grouped since the dates differ.p  pGoogle searches have proved fruitless queries like emandroid sqlite order before groupem and emandroid sqlite group by orderem yield no related results.p  pHow can I select the emone latestem message for each address without removing my codeGROUPcode clause as codeCOUNTcode relies upon this Do I need two queriesp  pstrongEditstrong Based on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma7745635570191the answera Adrian linked me to in the comments, I came up with two queries which both produced the same result one row, in which the count was 7 which is the total number of addresses, not messages emperem address, and the address shown was not that of the latest message.p  pThe two queries werep  precodeCursor cursor  db.rawQuery       SELECT t., COUNTt.messagecontent AS count       FROM messagesdatabase t       INNER JOIN           SELECT address, MAXdate AS maxdate           FROM messagesdatabase           GROUP BY address        ss ON t.address  ss.address AND t.date  ss.maxdate,     null  Cursor cursor  db.rawQuery       SELECT t1., COUNTt1.messagecontent AS count       FROM messagesdatabase t1       LEFT OUTER JOIN messagesdatabase t2       ON t1.address  t2.address AND t1.date lt t2.date       WHERE t2.address IS NULL,     null  codepre

Negative 2596 pI am trying to use Spring MVC 3 and Hibernate 4.1 to get declarative transaction management, providing an open session for the entire length of the request.  I only have one manager layer for data access, which directly uses the session.  This is annotated with Transactional, and the session closes upon exiting this layer and I get a lazy load exception in the controller.  p  pSo I added the OpenSessionInViewFilter filter, and the logs state that this filter is correctly configured and they also show this filter opening a session.  Unfortunately, my manager layer opens and closes its own session anyway, just as before, and I get the same lazy load exception in the controller.  p  pEdit noted that in my log, I get the filter session open, HibernateTransactionManager session open, HibernateTransactionManager session closed, lazy load exception, then filter session closed.  So I know that there is an open session somewhere during the lazy load exception, but the object was loaded in a transaction associated with the other, closed session.p  pI thought that removing Transactional from the manager class would remove session management from that layer and let the filter do its job, but then the sessionFactory.getCurrentSession simply gets a closed session it doesnt have access to the filters provided open session.  p  pHow can I get access to the OpenSessionInViewFilters clearly open sessionp  pspringappservlet.xmlp  precodeltbeans ..  ltcontextcomponentscan

Negative 2596 pI have a domain model and a data mapper built with PHP and MySql.  Some domain objects appear only in the context of others and in these cases I am using dependent mappings, i.e. the dependent objects do not have their own mapper, but are instead persisted by their owners mapper.p  pFor performance reasons I am joining multiple tables and issuing one SQL query, rather than one query per table, and this is where the difficulty arises the results of my queries are cartesian joins of course and will require a fair amount of array sifting to get sensible data with which to populate domain objects.p  pFor example, I have three tables one parent P1 and two children C1 and C2.  If a single record in P1 has two records in both C1 and C2, I have four records in my result set.  I can cycle through the result set array looking for unique values and create a fresh array from these, but that seems like a lot of work.p  pThis is bound to be a common problem.  What is the typical way to solve it  I looked through the SPL data structures and iterators but didnt find anything useful.  I dont want to split into multiple queries unless I really have to.p  pThanksp

Negative 2596 pIm working on a WPF application that displays range distance measurements in real time. I use the chart plotter to display a line graph and refresh this at around 10Hz.

When there is suddenly no target Id like to simply break the plot until a valid range measurement is received again.p  pCurrently when there is no target I add a value that exceeds the maximum, however this causes the graph to shoot off the scale and then when a target is within range it shoots down again.

Negative 2596 pBear with me as this might seem similar to  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions726761javascriptopeninanewwindownottabJavaScript open in a new window, not taba, but the method by which the link is executed is different.  I am opening a Sales Script application via a third party application when a soft phone is answered.  If the sales rep already has a browser window open and they always do, a new tab is opened within the existing window and it isnt always readily noticeable. They are requesting that I always have my application pop a new window, but as near as I can tell the only way to do this is via the browsers preferences. Is there by any chance some javascript I am not aware of that will undock a tab  I suspect the answer is no, but had to ask.p  pThanks for your timep  p[EDIT] I thought maybe this was out of scope of the question initially, but I think it could shed light on what I am trying to do  A 3rd party app iSymphony runs on the local machine and listens to events on our call controller.  When the rep answers, it fires a URL, which is opened in the systems default browser.  I dont really have any control over how its opened, which is why I was hoping for a javascript solution to ensure I was in a new window.p

Negative 2596 pIm using a DataGrid control with the RowDetailsTemplate property defined. Obviously, clicking on a row will display the row details for that row. However, once the row details are displayed then I have a problem when scrolling downwards in the DataGrid. As soon as the row whose details are visible moves up and out of view, then the row details vanish instantly causing the following rows to jump up and fill the space. Scrolling upwards again causes the row details to appear instantly causing the following rows to jump back down to provide the space.p  pThis does not seem be a virtualization problem because the same behavior occurs no matter what the value of EnableRowVirtualization. Also, I understand that from the perspective of a visual tree this makes sense since the row details container is within the row container. However, the behavior just looks visually silly in practice.p  pIs there anyway to keep the row details always visible, even if the actual row is not visible, until the row is deselectedp

If they match, it logs the user in.pli ul  pIm using the timestamp of the current hour as some servers have slightly different times and it takes a while between generating and validating the token,p  pSo, how is this What would you suggestp  pThanks a lotp

Negative 2596 pI need to read several megabytes raw text strings out of my GAE Datastore and then write them all to a new PDF file, and then make the PDF file available for the user to download.p  pI am well aware of the sandbox restrictions that prevent you from writing to the file system. I am wondering if there is a crafty way of creating a PDF inmemory or a combo of memory and the blobstore and then storing it somehow so that the clientside browser can actually pull it down as a file and save it locally.p  pThis is probably a huge stretch, but my only other option is to farm this task out to a nonGAE server, which I would like to avoid at all cost, even if it takes a lot of extra development on my end. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 2596 pIm using Racket and what I want to do is develop a random list of given elements that also has a given length. I know how to create the list but the problem that Im having is I dont know how to keep the same list every time I call the function using the list from the command line without recreating the list which would be different since the list is consists of randomly chosen elements. This is what I havep  precodedefine gameColors red green blue yellow black define currentGameList  define input 4 define randomNumber random 5  if equal randomNumber 0   if lt length currentGameList  input 1       set currentGameList append currentGameList list car gameColors       otherwise       set currentGameList currentGameList   otherwise   set currentGameList currentGameList codepre  pAnd then the if block repeats for each of the different possible results for randomNumber. All I need to know is how can I call my guess function repeatedly from the command line, which uses currentGameList, without having my program recreate currentGameList every time. The guess function also has parameters that have to be entered by the user so it must be entered at command line each time. Any help is appreciated.p

FileRoutine is the main problem Im running into. It has 2 public classes. LoadStudents, and LoadAssignments.

Negative 2596 pOn a Build machine, I have both VS 2010 and VS 2012 installed. We are nearly finished migrating from VS 2010 to 2012 and have just migrated to 2012, the build machine is also on TFS 2012. I seem to need this for features like static code analysis.p  pWhen running the build I now encounter errors the FXCop seems to be very good at selecting the wrong .exe version whereas different rule .dlls are in the project files. Meaning I have v10 files in the project file, but v11 exe is taken or vice versa. On top of that after uninstalling VS2010 I ran into problems with some legacy C projects that require VS 2010 requiring some MSBuild v100 rather than v110.p  pIn the end I uninstalled VS2012 and probably will revert once we have completely moved to VS 2012 some members of the team are still happy if projects are compatible with VS 2010. Actually, things are working now with only VS2010 installed though I had to revert some changes.p  pIs there a better way, is it e. g. possible to determine which FXCop you are using for static code analysis from within the build when having several VS versions installedp

Negative 2596 pSorry might be a long post to explain this wierd bug. I am fairly certain its more of a bug or a setting i have missed than an issue with my formula code. I have formula called codeCalcallcode and basically it has the following formula repeated for different payment types eg rent, outgoings, renttotal, rentsubtotal, rentgrandtotal etc.p  precodeshared numberVar CurrGrossTotalGT CurrGrossTotalGT  CurrGrossTotalGT  PayValueGrossRentPA codepre  pbasically a big calc field. I then have another formula which calls up this value to the correct row eg subtotal row or grand total row which looks like thisp  pFormula name PayValueGrossRentPATotalGTp  pCodep  precodeWhilePrintingRecords shared numberVar CurrGrossTotalGT  CurrGrossTotalGT codepre  pThe issue i have is i have updated an unrelated formula within this report and it has affected the total counts of these formula fields. To correct this issue for the above example i would need to remove code that i have shown above in codeCalcallcode, save the formula, reopen codeCalcallcode and paste back in the exact same formula and then PayValueGrossRentPATotalGT would show the correct value again. I cant delete all information within codeCalcallcode and repopulate later it needs to be the specific formulas that are affected.p  pIs it a setting i need to have in place is it a bug which has a patch fix it is a real pain as i dont know what totals are affected and need to reconcile this big report everytime i need to change a field.p  pthanks in advance any advice is appreciatedp  hr  pUpdate Think the issue lies in my CalcAll formula.

Negative 2596 pThis is a fairly general query as Im very confused about how to do this. I want to use the apache server which I have downloaded as part of XAMPP in order to test the website I am building, which will use php and mysql. The general question is how do I do thisp  pAs far as I understand it, the files go into Cxampphtdocs, which can then be accessed via localhost. What confuses me though is that the XAMPP admin stuff is also located here  so, for instance, I cant replace the file index.php without losing access to phpMyAdmin and so on. Do I have to create a new folder for the website within thisp  pI tried setting up a virtual host using instructions I found online. I added it to the windows host file and to the xampp hosts config file as directed a hrefhttpsawmac.comxamppvirtualhostsherea, for instance. Having done this the Apache service would not start and gave me an error log very similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16644064xamppsessioncacheisnotconfiguredhintsslsessioncachethis onea. I followed the instructions given in the answer to that, and it still did not work. I have since removed and reinstalled it and it is working ok again, but without the virtual hosts set up.p  pFinally, I want to use HTMLPad to build the website because I really like its real time preview feature. However, to set this up, it again needs to be connected with the server. The instructions it gives arep  blockquote   pIndepth Tutorial How do I preview PHP filesp      pTo be able to preview PHP files locally without uploading to web, you   need to have a web server installed on your computer and it must be   configured to support PHP files. Please refer to PHP and web server   manuals for more info on installing web server with PHP support.p      pWe recommend to use the free Apache web server from apache.orgp      pStep 1  What is your document root Find out what is your local web   server document root folder. The document root folder stores web page   files available via your web server URL. Please refer to your web   server manual for more info.p      pStep 2  What is your web server address Find out what is your local   web server URL, usually it is codehttplocalhostcodep      pStep 3  Make sure your web server works Verify that your web server   really works with PHP files. To do this, save a PHP file to your web   document root and try to open it via web browser. For example, if your   web document root is chtdocs, save your file as chtdocsindex.php   and try to open it via URL codehttplocalhostindex.phpcodep      pIf your web server works, you are now ready to configure internal   preview.p      pStep 4  Configure internal preview Now you must tell the editor   software how to use your web server to display the PHP file preview.p      pOn the Options menu, click Preferences In Preferences window, click   Preview folder Click Mappings, then click Add Enter your document   root folder and the corresponding web address, in the above example   you would enter chtdocs and codehttplocalhostcodep blockquote  pAgain, in the context of all the above, Im not quite sure I understand this. Presumably this links to all the php, mysql etc files within the original htdocs folder But does it matter where the files Im working on are saved, for examplep  pBasically, Im just a bit confused, and any help would be very much appreciatedp

I spent approximately 5 hours trying to get my code to use fancytree instead of dynatree and Im at a point of extreme frustration as it just wont work, the error messages are garbled, the documentation is appalling and there is precious little on the internet about it.p  pId rather stick with dynatree, which just works.  Is there any way I can implement the filter shown in the fancytree example in dynatree instead  Im too much of a javascript noob to understand what the code is trying to do.p

But inside the loop, elements would sometimes be skipped, in a pattern I could not discern.p  pLike I said, the problem is fixed by adding the final line. Perhaps the return value of the function being passed to codeeachcode matters somehow My question isnt how do I fix this but why does this workp

Negative 2596 pWe have a project with a module structure like thisp  precode Project    mod1      mod1.cpp      mod1.h      main.cpp    mod2      mod2.cpp      mod2.h      main.cpp    more modules codepre  pThe main.cpp file in each module instantiates and tests that module. One module can include and use another module. So for example, module 1 can include module 2 and eventually other modules.p  pWe want to create a makefile which compiles and includes the correct modules and main.cpp file. So if I write make module2 the makefile would compile mod2.cpp, main.cpp in module 2 and include mod2.h. If I write make module1 the makefile would compile mod2.cpp, mod1.cpp main.cpp in module 1 and include mod1.h and mod2.h.p  pMy experience with makefiles is modest, and Ive used several days on this without success. Making it generic would be preferable so that adding a new module would not require major changes to the makefile.p  pThe closest solution I got is thisp  precode.PHONY clean  FLAGSstdc11 g ISYSTEMCPATHinclude ISYSTEMCPATH LSYSTEMCPATHliblinux64 lsystemc addprefix I, wildcard src  SRCSWITHOUTMAIN filterout main.cpp, shell find src name .cpp TARGETOBJSsubst src, .buildobj, subst .cpp,.o,SRCSWITHOUTMAIN  all filterout unittest, subst src, ,wildcard src  .SECONDARY  .buildobj.o src.cpp     mkdir p shell dirname      g FLAGS  c o   clean     rm r .build    TARGETOBJS .buildobjmain.o     mkdir p shell dirname .buildbin     g FLAGS  o .buildbin codepre  pSRCSWITHOUTMAIN holds all the cpp files of all modules except the main files. TARGETOBJS are the corresponding list of object files. The  target matches on, for example mod1 which compiles all cpp files and main.cpp of mod1.p  pThe problem is, occasionally we get segfaults while running after compiling, and we need to do a make clean ampamp make for it to work again. One day I used 4 hours debugging my code just to find out the makefile is some kind of broken. Now everybody on the project uses make clean ampamp make all the time in fear of going through the same as I did...p  pDoes anyone know a clever way to do this By the way this is a SystemC project.p

Negative 2596 pI am doing a homework assignment for my C class, and am trying to do what I consider a fairly simple math function, but Im getting stumped because it is not returning what I expect it to return. Basically, its just an APR problem and I am trying to convert from APR to monthly interest. My instructor has given us this formula to calculate thisp  ul limonthlyInterest  APR  100  1112li ul  pSo this is the code I am using. I separated yearlyInterest from the monthlyInterest calculation because I was making sure I wasnt making a simple mistakep  precodedouble balance, payment, APR cin gtgt balance gtgt payment gtgt APR const double yearlyInterest  APR  100  1 const double monthlyInterest  powyearlyInterest, 112 codepre  pUsing the inputs 1000, 100, and 19.9, the results I get in my physical calculator, and what I am expecting arep  ol liyearlyInterest 1.19li limonthlyInterest 1.015...li ol  pBut the result my debugger is giving me isp  ol liyearlyInterest 1.19li limonthlyInterest  1li ol  pSo basically, I am asking why my monthlyInterest is incorrect I dont believe it is a type issue because pow will output a double.

But now I require two requests going from the same view controller. So when I do this, the data is getting mixed up. Say I have a connection for search being implemented, the data from the user details may come in when I do a search. The data is not being assigned to the right codeNSDictionarycode based on the switch Im doing inside codeconnectionDidFinishLoadingcode. Im using a single delegate for the entire network engine.p  pIm new to codeNSURLConnectioncode, should I setup a queue or something Please help.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pHeres the part where I receive data in the codeconnectionDidFinishLoadingcodep  precode voidconnectionDidFinishLoadingNSURLConnection connection      if [connection.tag integerValue]  kGetUserDetails         networkDataSource.userData  self.jsonDetails     if [connection.tag integerValue]  kSearchConnection         networkDataSource.searchData  self.jsonDetails  codepre  pand after this I have a switch case that calls the required delegate for the required view controller.p

Negative 2596 pI have code in place to disable caching in my MVC application. Im using the following response headers. They seem to work in all browsers except for Chrome currently using version 31.0.1650.48. Users are able to submit a form with model values. When they hit the back button I need the page to reload with a blank model. The headers appear to partially work since the request is hitting the action and returning the blank model.

Negative 2596 pSo I am building a REST service using EF and WebAPI. I have a two classes like thisp  precodepublic class App     [Key]   public int ID getset    public virtual ICollectionltUsergt Users getset    public class User    [Key]   public int ID getset    public virtual ICollectionltAppgt Apps getset  codepre  pI can see that EF correctly creates the tables and everything is peachy. The problem, is I cant post composed objects through REST, I need to post by ID references and compose them on the server level. p  precode public class UserViewModel    [Key]   public int ID getset    public virtual ICollectionltIntgt Apps getset    Automapper config Mapper.CreateMapltUser, UserViewModelgt codepre  pI tried doing this with the Automapper, however it is not doing the Object  ID map on its own. Is there a way to accomplish this without using automapper, or if not, how to do this with automapper p  pA good example of the behavior I am expecting is found a hrefhttpwww.asp.netmvctutorialsgettingstartedwithefusingmvccreatinganentityframeworkdatamodelforanaspnetmvcapplication relnofollowherea p  precode public class Enrollment      public int EnrollmentID  get set      public int CourseID  get set      public int StudentID  get set      public Grade Grade  get set       public virtual Course Course  get set      public virtual Student Student  get set   codepre  pYou can see that Enrollment has a property called CourseID. According to the article The CourseID property is a foreign key, and the corresponding navigation property is Course. So this maps quite well to a WebAPI REST service, you ignore the Course property and map the CourseID to a viewmodel and POST the enrollment object with the CourseID string. However, how can I translate this behavior to a collection of courses or a many to many relationshipp
Negative 2596 pIve got two inputs, styled primarily by Zurbs a hrefhttpfoundation.zurb.com relnofollowFoundationa framework. Theyre in a code.row.collapsecode and each in a code.medium6.columnscode these columns are 50 width, floated left, no margins. The inputs themselves are 100 wide within their containers. Its all pretty simple, and the Inspector and jQuery.css are all returning what Id expect them to. But theres a border issue. Heres the gist of the CSSp  precodeinput    border 1px solid dddddd   amp.first      borderrightwidth 0     codepre  pThis is to have the effect of collapsing the middle border. But for some reason, this codeborderrightwidth 0code is throwing Webkit Chrome and Safari but not Firefox off. The inspector shows 1px border, and the proper bordercolor. The white input background lines up properly with the second input that is, theres room for the border, but theres no gray border. Maybe its rendering transparentp  pIf I open this up on a retina display, it renders normally  proper borders on both. If I zoom in, the borders show up when it hits the small media query mobile device sizes. But I cant make this border show up on a nonretina, desktop display in Chrome.p  pHeres how it looks in Chromep  pimg srchttpf.cl.lyitems231K3x0U30413a342Z3TScreen20Shot202014040720at2011.19.1320AM.png altChrome screenshotp  pAnd heres how it looks in Firefoxp  pimg srchttpf.cl.lyitems31053v0U222y0x3d2e3hScreen20Shot202014040720at2011.50.0620AM.png altFirefox screenshotp  pTo doublecheck, I used the Web Inspector to apply a simple border to the first element. It showed up fine looked like the Firefox screenshot. Adding codeborderrightwidth 0code reintroduced the problem. It emseemsem clear that thats the issue. But I dont know whyp  pIt seems like codeborderradiuscode may play into this as well The Firefox screenshot above shows a doubleborder in the middle, despite the Inspector showing 0 right border. If I uncheck codeborderradiuscode, in Firefox, it fixes that issue.p  pThese properties should all be independent of one another. Why are they affecting each otherp  h2Edith2  pTrying to recreate in codepen. Unsuccessful so far, but it looks like it has something to do with codetransformcode  these inputs are in a container that is set with the following p  precodeposition absolute top 50 left 50 include transformtranslate50,50 codepre  pThis has the effect of vertically and horizontally centering the element no matter the width or height in modern browsers. When I turn off codetransformcode the border shows up as it should. As I understand, codetransformcode accesses the GPU Or it can It seems quite possible that this is whats throwing it off. If you look at the screenshot, there are strange border artifacts like, a partial, interior border on the right side of the left element that I cant explain.p  h2Edit 2h2  pIts got to be codetransformcode  changing the codebordercolorcode to red makes this clear the border is being rendered at a subpixel level and then, for some reason, cut off in a funky way. You can see a vague pink border around the left inputp  pimg srchttpf.cl.lyitems01281f1g201i132n3S1FScreen20Shot202014040720at204.28.5420PM.png altsubpixel borderp

Negative 2596 pI want to generate 150 random numbers with values as positive integers code1,2,3,4,5.....code such that sum of all random numbers is 270 and p  precodeProb[1]  0.405 Prob[2]  0.345 Prob[3]  0.125 Prob[4]  0.092 Prob[gt5]  0.033 codepre  pBasically, sum of all random numbers is fixed, probability is fixed and random number should take values greater than 0.p  pDoes anyone know how can I generate it in pythonMATLABC or any other programming language.p
Negative 2596 pI have to write a program that shows some kind of possibly complex shape that rotates and moves around. The problem is, for any kind of solution I can think of, I need the sine and cosine function.p  pFirst, I had a problem of setting to 386 mode too early the executable should be 16 bit, compiled with TASM.p  pRight now the problem is that I get weird values for my loopp  precode.data  180 dw 180 25 dw 25 degrad dd  tempvar dw  alpha dw   .386 .code  start  finit  fldpi fidiv word ptr 180 fstp dword ptr degrad      mov word ptr alpha, 0  calcsin mov ax, word ptr alpha mov word ptr tempvar, ax     fild tempvar     fsin     fimul word ptr 25     fistp word ptr tempvar mov DX,word ptr tempvar   inc word ptr alpha cmp word ptr alpha,360 jne calcsin      mov ax, 4c00h     int 21h end start codepre  pafter this if I open up Turbo Debugger in DOSBox, I get weird, huge values in DX. Ive also tried copying and fixing, since they wouldnt compile some examples from online to see if they work, they usually ended up not working...p
Negative 2596 pI wanted to know if there are any other recent plotting libraries in python other than matplotlib which good visual aesthetics to publish in webpages.p  pI know a hrefhttpsplot.ly relnofollowpyplota is good at this but, I want to use an offline library not an api. This question might be a duplicate of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions52652prettygraphsandchartsinpythonthisa, but it was asked long back in 2008, just wanted to ask if there are any recent onesp
Negative 2596 pI want to make two parallel working forks and in the end wait for them to finish.p  precode for int i  0 i lt 2 i      pidt pid  fork      ifpid lt 0          fprintfstderr,Cannot fork         exitEXITFAILURE          else ifpid  0          switchi                      case 0                 first child                 exitEXITSUCCESS                 break             case 1                  second child                 exitEXITSUCCESS                 break                  break          else          parent       codepre  pThe problem is that the main program terminates before the child ones. If I add wait0 to the else parent part it waits to every process so they dont work at the same time but one by one. I assumed that I can simply put the wait or waitpid after the loop but thats not working either. I thought that after the fork the parent continues normally so why doesnt it wait when the wait is outside the loop and ifelse structurep  pSorry for bothering and thanks in advance.p

But I just get this error Failed to create the pipeline.. I also tried unchecking the email box, still same error. Tried it over and over.p  pNo where to go from there... Anyone been able to create this pipeline and get it all workingp  pIt seems that this pipeline configuration must go through in order for push to deploy from now. I havent seen any news or notification about this change...p  pFwiw, the documentation a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comappenginedocspushtodeploy relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comappenginedocspushtodeploya states nothing about pipelines. Its just outdated I guess.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pWhat do you know... I went on trying to configure this pipeline on the live GAE project the one described above is the dev GAE project Im using... and it worked. I could configure a pipeline ok. After that, I could once more pushtodeploy, alas only on the emliveem version so far. I might try creating a new dev project, it seems existing projects break from time to time... I have had similar problems before and creating a new project DOES solve things from time to time.....p

The game is in portrait mode only. When I view the game in the simulator, the ads appear perfect but they are on top of my content and have also shifted the top content off the screen so you can barely see the scores. Im not sure if I need to do something in the ViewController or the scene itself that has the ads running, but I think the ViewController is the correct place. p  pIm hoping someone else had this problem and figured it out.

Negative 2596 pIts a self expaining question but here we go.  Im creating a business app in Django, and i didnt wanted to spread all the logic across app AND database, but in the other hand, i didnt wanted to let the Database handle this task its possible through the use of a hrefhttpwww.postgresql.orgdocs9.2staticplpgsqltrigger.html relnofollowTriggersa.p  pSo I wanted to reproduce the behavior of the Databse Triggers, but inside the Model Class in Django um currently using Django 1.4.p  pAfter some research, I figured out that with single objects, I could override the save and delete methods of models.Model class, inserting the before and after hooks so they could be executed before and after the parents savedelete. Like Thisp  precode     class MyModelmodels.Model           def beforeself              pass           def afterself             pass           commitonsuccess the decorator is only to ensure that everything occurs inside the same transaction          def saveself, args, kwargs              self.before              superMyModel,self.saveargs, kwargs              self.after codepre  pThe BIG problem is with bulk operations. Django doesnt triggers the savedelete of the models when running the updatedelete from its QuerySet. Insted, it uses the QuerySets own method. And to get a little bit worst, it doesnt trigger any signal either.p  pbEditb Just to be a little more specific the model loading inside the view is dynamic, so its impossible to define a model specific way. In this case, I should create an Abstract Class and handle it there.p  pMy last attempt was to create a custom Manager, and in this custom manager, override the update method, looping over the models inside the queryset, and trigering the save of each model take in consideration the implementation above, or the signals system. It works, but results in a database overload imagine a 10k rows queryset being updated.p

If I had to guess, the codekeyStorePasswordcode field in the Spring bean is correct, but the key itself requires a password, and Ldaptive isnt taking that into account...p  pIn any event, any ideas as to why Im seeing this exception And if I am correct, and I cant change Ldaptives source code, then what are my options Are there any codekeytoolcode commands I can use to drop the individual keys password, and to just accept the storewide onep

Negative 2596 pI am creating a wizard dynamically. The wizard is a quiz. The wizard is a user control .ascx. On OnInit of the control I create steps and add them dynamically. On each step I have a user control also .ascx containing a radio button list. This user control is created based on a database setting. This all works fine. But, I would like the user to be able to go back and edit their quiz and I do not seem to be able to load up saved answers. What I had planned on doing was to create a BindAnswer method that retrieved the answer from the database and set the radio button list selected item in the usercontrol to reflect the answer. This BindAnswer method is getting the data from the database, and in the code behind it is setting the user control correctly. But, it does not render to the screen...

Negative 2596 pIm designing a class in R that has a lot of the same behaviors as a 2dimensional matrix it can be subsetted by row or column, it has dimnames, etc. So I want it to support all the standard matrix operations such as coderownamescode, code[code, and so on. But Im not sure what all of these method names are, and Im not sure which of them I need to implement. For instance, do I need to implement coderownamescode and coderownamesltcode explicitly, or is it sufficient to implement codedimnamescode and codedimanmesltcode Basically, is there a list somewhere of all the functions that one would have to implement for a class to act like a 2dimensional matrixlike thingp

Negative 2596 pI have some wide tables in HTML that require scrolling leftright in the browser to view.  Id like to vertically keep the top row in place while allowing it to scroll leftright.  p  pI have been scouring the web for something simple but I havent found anything that allows for both of these conditions.p  pEDIT I restate my question in a possibly more clear way I am looking to alter existing html files with existing html tables so that the first row is fixed vertically but scrolls horizontally with the body.  I dont have control over how these html files are initially made so I must resort to adding any styling that I can through python in order to get my desired output.  In my mind there would only be one scroll bar.  Can this be done Anyone have an ideap  pTo give more information I have tried many options including trying to add a css class for the first row and using overflowy as well as using multiple divs.  I would prefer to solve this in css formatting as modifying the css file is probably easier done with python than adding a bunch of divs to the already formulated html table all of the editing is being done through python. So far every approach at best looks a bit off and undesirably leaves a scroll bar directly under the first row.br I would like to keep the first row looking the same but just fixed vertically and allow it scroll with the rest of the rows horizontally.p  pThanksp

Negative 2596 pGood morning,p  pI am currently developing a ssis script task in c.  I am asking myself, it is possible to loop through all input variables. Currently I am accessing every single variable using Row.VariableName. Since I have many variables this is sort of a pain. And it gets even worse when I change the input variables. So, is it possible to loop through all input variables which I have selected within the script task window without calling every single variable indepentlyp  pA classical foreach loopcontainer is not suited within my case due to some specialities within my script task. p  pI am would appreciate any advice.  p

Negative 2596 pIve been working for some time on a Javascript FP library called stronga hrefhttpsgithub.comramdaramda relnofollowRamdaastrong, and Im having a slight problem with naming things.  Youve heard the old line, right  There are only two hard problems in Computer Science cache invalidation, naming things, and offbyone errors.   p  pIn this library, almost every function of more than one parameter is automatically curried.  And this works well for most usecases.  But there are some issues with a few functions which are noncommutative binary operators.  The issue is that the English names often tend to imply something different than what happens when currying is applied.  For example,p  precodevar div10  divide10 codepre  pemsoundsem like it should be a function that divides its parameter by 10.  But in fact it divides its parameter strongintostrong 10, which is pretty clear if you look at the definitionp  precodevar divide  curryfunctiona, b      return a  b  codepre  pSo instead the expectedp  precodediv1050 gt 5  NO codepre  pIn fact, you getp  precodediv1050 gt 0.2  Correct, but surprising codepre  pWe handle this by documenting the difference from peoples possible expectations, and creating codedivideBycode, which is just codeflipdividecode and codesubtractNcode, which is codeflipsubtractcode.  But we havent found a good equivalent for functions such as codeltcodep  precodeR.lt  curryfunctiona, b       return a lt b  codepre  por its cousins codeltecode, codegtcode, and codegtecode.p  pMy own intuition would be that p  precodemaplt5, [8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9]  gt [false, false, false, false, true, true, false] codepre  pBut of course, it actually returnsp  precodegt [true, true, true, false, false, false, true] codepre  pSo Id like to do the same documentandpointtoalternatename routine for codeltcode and its ilk.  But I havent been able to find a good name.  The only real candidate has been codeltValcode and that doesnt really work when called with both arguments.   We did stronga hrefhttpsgithub.comramdaramdaissues175 relnofollowdiscuss this issueastrong, but had no good conclusions.p  pHave others dealt with this and come up with good solutions  Or even if not, any good suggestions for a name for the flipped versions of these functionsp  hr  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pSomeone suggested that this be closed because unclear what you were asking, and I guess the question really emwasem lost a bit in the explanation.  The simple question isp  pWhat would be a good, intuitive name for a flipped version of codeltcodep

Negative 2596 pThe project I have is a reimbursement of materials in a game. The materials come in various packages listed in the array below. Part of my code gives me the total number of units I need to reimburse, and I have to use the packages from the array below.p  pThis is the multi dimensional array. The item[ore][100] array indicates that the item listed gives 100 units when used and stacks to only 100 key  stacksize.

My totalOre variable from part of my code dictates that I have 15,825 units to reimburse total as an example. Obviously Ill have some extra that will be reimbursed as I dont have an item that gives smaller than 100 units not a big deal if the user gets a bit more in this case. p  pSo I need a code snippet to tell me that I need to reimburse 15x Item 3, 1x Item 2 and 4x Item 1 for a total of 15,900 units.p  pAdditionally, if I have say....totalOre  219,427, I need my code to dictate that I send 100x Item 3, then 100x Item 3, then 19x Item 3, then 1x Item 2 for a total of 219,500 units, because of the stacksize limitation of 100 I cant send a user more than 100x of these items or they wont get them.p  pI assume some sort of loop would be needed in addition the Modulus  operator.

Negative 2596 pIn RestKit is it possible to use identificationAttributes that are actually not part of the JSON responsep  pMy case is the following  I have a service that lists all articles for the currently loggedin user like codehttpexample.comjsonarticles.jsoncodep  pMy problem is the following  since the application allows multiple users to login, I keep the articles in the database together with the userId for each article. If I set the codearticleMapping.identificationattributes  [articleId]code, then I have a problem if two users using the device have the same article  it will be overwritten regardless of the userId, because it is not part of the response.p  pTo sum up the factsp  ul liFor the JSON request I do not send the userId, it is part of the server session only, so I think that I cannot use codeRKRoutecodeli liI do the mapping of the article with the user manually after RestKit mapping.li liI do not have the userId property as part of the JSON response, it exists only inside the ArticleManagedObject.li ul  pIs there a way to inform RestKit that during the mapping, it should check the codearticleIduserIdcode combination as an identificator I tried using identificationPredicate with no success.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAn example response from the server, when UserA is logged inp  precode      data         articles[                           articleId1,             titleObjective C Basics          ,                         articleId2,             titleXcode Basics                 ]      codepre  pand here is the response when UserB is logged inp  precode      data         articles[                           articleId1,             titleObjective C Basics          ,                         articleId3,             titleJava Basics                 ]      codepre  pIf UserA logs in, everything is fine. But if UserB logs in from the same device, then article 1 is mapped to UserB, and from now on, the connection between UserA and article 1 is lost.p  pAs I understand from your suggestion, the only solution is to return also the user id from the service, set RKUnionAssignmentPolicy and let RestKit take care of the mapping currently I am manually making the mapping between articles and users after RestKit.p  pAnother question that I have  is it possible to set the identificationAttributes or identificationPredicate so that it makes a separation between object article 1 for UserA and object article 1 for UserB.p

Negative 2596 pIn my first Dart command line application I use 3 classes. Initially they all were in the same source file. All worked fine. Then I decided to move one class into a newly created library. I created a new project of type Package Template and put the class file with an added library tag line at the top into the lib folder as seen with other library packages and described in the pub file structure conventions.p  pTo be able to use the library class I understood that I had to Run pub build from the yaml file of the library package first. When I do that I get the error messagep  pcodePub build failed, [65] There are no source directories present. The default directories are benchmark, bin, example, test and web.codep  pMy source file is in the lib directory. I have seen this to be the case with all installed packages and it is described this way in the pub documentation. I have no idea what I miss here. Any hint is appreciated.p
Negative 2596 pThe context is both sender and receiver will do 1 database operations, i.e persist data 2 queue operations, i.e. send or retrieve message from queuep  pMy understanding is those two operations can be in same transaction scope via DTC For example, sender does database and queue operations can be in same transaction the same as receiver.p  pHowever, sender and receiver can NOT be in the same transaction scope.

Negative 2596 pI read how current master election algorithms like Raft, Paxos or Zab elect master on a cluster and couldnt understand why they use sophisticated algorithms instead of simple bully algorithm.p  pIm developing a cluster library and use UDP Multicast for heartbeat messages. Each node joins a multicast address and also send datagram packets periodically to that address. If the nodes find out there is a new node that sends packets to this multicast address, the node is simply added to cluster and similarly when the nodes in the cluster dont get any package from a node, they remove it from the cluster. When I need to choose a master node, I simply iterate over the nodes in the cluster and choose the oldest one.p  pI read some articles that implies this approach is not effective and more sophisticated algorithms like Paxos should be used in order to elect a master or detect failures via heartbeat messages. I couldnt understand why Paxos is better for splitbrain scenarios or other network failures than traditional bully algorithm because I can easily find out when quorum of nodes leave from the cluster without using Raft. The only benefit I see is the count of packets that each server have to handle only master sends heartbeat messages in Raft while in this case each node has to send heartbeat message to each other. However I dont think this is a problem since I can simply implement similar heartbeat algorithm without changing my master election algorithm.p  pCan someone elaborate on thatp

Negative 2596 pFirstly both JavaBean and Map can be used as parameter for MyBatis, but where I shall use bean and where I shall use map as parameterp  pI would like use bean when I update database, because what I am going to update is Object. for example if I am going to update a city namep  precodeCity city  cityMapper.selectCityid city.setNamenew city cityMapper.updatecity codepre  pwhat I updated is a city object.p  pBut when I selectAll or deleteAll, I dont know which one is better.... currently I am using map as parameter.

I will understand this code as I want to delete a city, but not the cities from USA. Using Mapp  precodeMapltgt param  new HashMapltgt param.putcountry,USA cityMapper.deleteAllparam codepre  phere I will understand this code as I want to delete all cities by given parameters.p  pBut there are some benefits using bean.p  ol lilimit the parameters, I cannot set any other parameters which city bean does not have setterli liavoid spelling errorli ol  pSo please tell me, which way is better, and whyp  pMany thanks p

Here is what I getp  ul liI get, that you can convert binary numbers to decimal numbers by reading them from left to right, starting with a decimal value of 0, iterating over the digits of the binary number, adding 1 to the decimal number for every 1 you reach in the binary number, and multiplying by 2, when you move on to the next digit as explained in the last link. ul liBut why does this lead to the doubledabblealgorithm We dont want to convert in decimal, we want to convert in BCD. Why are we keeping the multiplying shifting, but we drop the adding of 1 Where is the connectionli ulli liI get, why we have to add 3, when a number in a BCDfield exceeds 4 before shifting. Because if you want that the BCD number gets multiplied by 2 if you shift it, you have to do some fixups. If you shift the BCD number code0000 1000code 8 and you want to get the double code0001 0011code 16, you have to add 3 the half of 6 before shifting, because by just shifting you end up with code0001 0000code 10 youre missing 6. ul liBut why do we want this and where is the adding of 1 happeningli ulli ul  pI guess I am just missing a little part.p

Negative 2596 pIm currently in a systems programming class and we went over the wait system call functions today. I was reading over the section on waitpid system call and in the options section it lists one called WNOHANG.p  precodepidt waitpidpidt pid, int status, int options codepre  pWNOHANG If no child specified by pid from the parameters has yet changed state, then return immediately, instead of blocking. In this case, the return value of waitpid is 0. If the calling process has no children that match the specification in pid, waitpid fails with the error ECHILD.p  pI understand waitpid was implemented to solve the limitations in wait however, Im not really sure about why you would use the WNOHANG option flag.p  pIf I were to render a guess it would be so that the parent process can preform other tasks and perhaps keep checking on its children to see if any of them have terminated. Sort of how a demon process sits in the background and waits for requests.p  pAny situational examples or regular examples would help as well.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2596 pI am very new in RESTful application and I have some doubts related to some REST concept.p  pI know that the fundamental concept in any RESTful API is the strongresourcestrong. A resource is an object with a type, associated data, relationships to other resources, and a set of methods that operate on it the HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT and DELETEp  pSo my first doubt is related to the resource concept. I am trying to do myself some example and I dont know if I have correctly understand what a resource is.p  pIn my mind a resource is what I have to transmit with my REST web sercice. So for example if I have a REST web service that given a VAT number come backs the invoices related to this VAT number. So these returned invoices objects are my resources.p  pSo a resource is something that I can working on I can obtain an existing reourcem add a new resource, update an existing resource or delete an existing resource.p  pIs it correct or am I missing somethingp  pIf it correct the second doubt is on the strongrepresentationstrong concept.p  pFrom what I have understand I can see a resource in serveral differents shapes or a resource can be exposed in several different ways, for example as HTML or as XML or as JSON and so on.p  pSo the same resource can be exposed in different ways and exist a mecchanism that convert a resource that can be a row stored into a database table into an HTML message or into an XML message or into a JSON message.p  pIs this interpratation correctp

Negative 2596 pIm looking at this example from Angulars docs for codeqcode but I think this probably applies to promises in general. They have this examplep  precodepromiseB  promiseA.thenfunctionresult    return result  1    promiseB will be resolved immediately after promiseA is resolved and its value  will be the result of promiseA incremented by 1 codepre  pBut Im not clear how this works. If I could write code.thencode on the result of the first code.thencode, chaining them, which I know I can, then codepromiseBcode is a promise object, of type codeObjectcode. It is not a codeNumbercode. So what do they mean by its value will be the result of promiseA incremented by 1 p  pAm I supposed to access that as codepromiseB.valuecode or something like that How can the success callback return a promise AND return result  1 Im missing something.p

Perhaps I have a conflicting package p  pRegarding SECRETKEY and CSRFSESSIONKEY I had SECRETKEY defined in my config.py. I was lead to believe that without defining CSRFSESSIONKEY that it would default to SECRETKEY. Nevertheless, I went ahead and defined a CSRFSESSIONKEY, but it didnt seem to make any difference. p  pLastly, I looked into the API change from  form.hiddentag  to  form.csrftoken . They still have references to both forms in the docs for the latest version. On the CSRF page, they have the latter, but in the quickstart they still have the former. Im not sure what is up with this, but just to be certain I implemented the version on the CSRF page as followsp  pstronginitstrong.pyp  precodefrom flaskwtf.csrf import CsrfProtect  CsrfProtectapp codepre  puserlogin.htmlp  precodeltformgt      form.csrftoken      ... ltformgt codepre  pBut I still end up getting the same response. p  pAs I said before, the FlaskWTF documentation is all over the place. So Ive been trying all sorts of combinations. At the bottom of this page a hrefhttpflaskwtf.readthedocs.orgenlatestcsrf.html relnofollowhttpflaskwtf.readthedocs.orgenlatestcsrf.htmla they reference an incorrect import, so I replaced myp  blockquote   pfrom flaskwtf import Form p blockquote  pwith p  blockquote   pfrom flask.ext.wtf import Formp blockquote  pStill no dice. Thanks for the comments though, gave me more to try outp  pI also just tried consolidating everything into a single docker container, but I still get the same result.p

Based on a command and its parameters the system needs to perform a certain task which is expressible using a java code. I need that these commands are stored for future execution based on user demand so the codeCodeArray[1..10]code in the above holds this list of java codes. For example, a user chooses a command from the list i.e., from the array and demands its execution.p  pMy thought is that I build an engine that based on the user selection, loads the corresponding command code from the array and executes it. p

Negative 2596 pI want to use Postgres and Neo4j together in my application. I was able to configure them, however, I am having difficulty persisting a partial node entity Cross store persistence.p  pGiven the following configurations and entities found below. It seems that I am able to persist both a traditional RDBMS JPA entity to postgres database and a NodeEntity to neo4j database, however, when trying to persist a partial entity to both via cross store persistence I get the following stack trace found below. It complains of a java.lang.ClassCastException saying that my PartialEntity cant be cast to a NodeBacked. I believe it must have something to do with the cross store configuration but I am unable to find the underlying issue.p  pI have created a sample project on github to demonstrate the issue Im facing.

Negative 2596 pIm new to AngularJS and still stuck at the basics.p  pIm creating a service with a http.get to load a couple of Json files. When I load the service into the controller I get empty arrays.p  pThis is my servicep  precodeapp.serviceproductService, [http, functionhttp     var lista  this     lista.products  []     lista.menu  []      http.getprodotti1.json.successfunctiondata         lista.products  data           http.getmenu1.json.successfunctiondata         lista.menu  data      ] codepre  pAnd this is my controllerp  precodeapp.controllerProductController, [productService, functionproductService     console.logproductService.products     console.logproductService.menu ] codepre  pThe console prints just an empty Array [ ]. If I put the console.logdata inside the success promise, the console.log prints the array just fine. I thought from codeschool it could be easier, but I guess Im missing a point to pass the data from the success promise to the controller. In many other situations I see the usage of scope variable, but I learnt that I can also avoid the use if I use this. So thats my code doesnt display any scope.p  pIm using Angular 1.4.1 FYI and I saw many forums and other questions but it seems a different situation.p  pThank youp

Negative 2596 pworking on a project using slf4j with log4jcoa I can see all needed log4j jar files in place. Not using loopback or java logging util. But I could not find any configuration files such as xml file anywhere. But I can see all logs go to a file with DEBUG level on. My question is, is this the default behavior of log4j Or it must exist a config file somewhere If I add config file, where is the right place to do so thanks.p

Negative 2596 pI converted a Swift 1.x project for iOS to Swift 2.x using Xcode 7 beta 3.  It compiles and runs but I have a linker warning persisting.

Negative 2596 pIm really struggling with Elixir supervisors and figuring out how to name them so that I can use them.

Basically, all I want is to spawn a process or task or GenServer or whatever is right when the application starts that I can send messages to which will in essence do a codeSystem.cmdcmd, optscode. I want this task or process to be supervised. When I send it a coderun, cmd, optscode message such as coderun, mv, [filetomove, movetohere]code I want it to spawn a new task or process to execute that command. For my use, I dont even need to ever get back the response from the task, I just need it to execute. Any guidance on where to go would be helpful. Ive read through the getting started guide but honestly it left me more confused because when I try to do what is done it never turns out as it does in the application.p  pThanks for your patience.p

Negative 2596 pQEMU is used by me as an emulator with PetaLinux kernel terminalonly with codenographiccode option.  p  pAt the beginning QEMU initializes itself and once its ready it bootsup the system. Usually, boot messages are printed in a terminal during the process. With that scenario everything works fine, system starts and one can login and use the system. Then, another simple peripheral device is implemented, which similarly is initialized printing control message to the output and the rest goes on the same way.  p  pThe problem rises when there is a child process spawned from inside the peripheral implementation  codeforkcode followed by codeexecvpcode . The main QEMU process parent no longer prints to the terminal output, the new process child only can do it. It seems like the parent process is probably still executing but loses the terminal. Without it one cannot see login prompt, so basically cannot use the system at all.p  pWhat is the reason  p

However, instead of filling out the dates again, I need them to be fillied out from the dates chosen on the previous page, that is to parse the forms inputs from page one to page two.  Now, I have read that it could be done with JavaScript using cookies and by using PHP. p  pstrongMy question is what is considered a better practice and why And if there are other good ways, what are they and why are they considered goodstrongp  pFrom what I understand, JavaScript is heavier to process, but is a good solution if php is not available to the website developer. Also, JavaScript is subject to being enabled on ones computer.p  pPHP, on the other hand is a more orthodox way, yet requires a database, so that with each submission, more and more entries in the database would apper, so more memory requires to host it.p  pPlease correct me if I am wrong, especially about the PHP method.p

Im trying to make a slot machine in Python, and I want to make a coins system, where you can actually earn coins so the game is better, but when I ran the code, it told me UnboundLocalError local variable referenced before assignment. I made my variable global, by puttingp  precodeglobal coins  coins  50 codepre  pwhich for some reason printed 50 and gave the UnboundLocalError error again, so from one answer I triedp  precodedef GlobalCoins         global coins           coins  50 codepre  pwhich, despite the following error, didnt print 50 NameError global name coins is not defined.  Soo I dont really know how to set one.  This is probably extremely basic stuff and this is probably also a duplicate question, but my web searches and attempts inprogram have proved fruitless, so Im in the doldrums for now.p

I mean, i check if its numeric first in code, then Entity Framework checks the value again so im using two different validation process, it seems bad to me.p  pOfcourse there is a client side too, maybe i can use numeric only textboxes, still im not sure.p  pAny ideasp  pHere is the full code, its probably horrible, im pretty new to Entity Framework like 34 daysp  precodeif IsPost      try              Worker curWorker  new Worker         try                      curWorker  m.Workers.Finddecimal.ParseRequest.Form[WorkerId]                  catch Exception                      errors  Ltfen bir personel sein. ltbr gt                   overhour.Worker  curWorker         overhour.PhaseId  curPhase.PhaseId          try                      overhour.OverhourAmount  decimal.ParseRequest.Form[OverhourAmount]                  catch Exception                      errors  Sre Saat alan saysal olmaldr. ltbr gt                   overhour.OverhourDate  DateTime.Today          curWorker.Overhours.Addoverhour          Accounting accounting  new Accounting         accounting.AccountingMethod  0         accounting.AccountingNote  curWorker.WorkerFullName   adl personelin,   overhour.OverhourAmount   saat sreli,   DateTime.Today.ToShortDateString   tarihli mesai kayd.         accounting.AccountingType  3  Maa         accounting.AccountingBorc  0         accounting.AccountingAlacak  curWorker.WorkerOverWorkSalary  overhour.OverhourAmount          accounting.Phases  curPhase          curWorker.Accountings.Addaccounting          if errors                        throw new WrongValueExceptionerrors                   m.SaveChanges         Response.RedirectPage.ParentPage          catch DbEntityValidationException ex              errors  kStatic.getValidationErrorsex.EntityValidationErrors, ltbr gt          catch WrongValueException ex              errors  ex.Message.ToString          catch Exception ex              errors  Bilinmeyen hata, teknik detaylar   ex.Message       codepre
