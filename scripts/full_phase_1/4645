Positive 4645 pI am setting up Sonatype Nexus OSS, and have some problems on how encoding works on Role names. The LDAP groups have nonlatin letters, so role names also have to have these. Everything works until I restart the nexus service  something happens with encoding and role id no longer has those non latin letters and has  instead. p  pWhat is interesting is that two adjacent fields  role id and role name are encoded differently.

Copying contents of name tag to id tag does not help. Nexus system shows that I have file.encoding  ANSIX3.41968. I tried making this into UTF8 hoping it would help, but failed so far  I tried EXPORT Dfile.encodingUTF8 or EXPORT LANGenUS.UTF8, but after Nexus restart file.encoding in Nexus is still the same.p  pAny suggestionsp

I wished to create an interface for a series of Control factories which would provide controls based on some business rules.p  pThe consumer of these controls would require, through the interface, that all controls created, should also implement some series of interfaces only one in my case which gave all these controls additional facilities not found generally in normal controls.p  pIt is worth noting that the following currently does not work.p  precodePublic Interface ISpecialControl End Interface  Public Interface IControlProvider     Function CreateControlOf T As Control, ISpecialControl As T End Interface  Public Class SpecialTextBoxProvider     Implements IControlProvider     Public Function CreateControlOf T As Control, ISpecialControl As T Implements IControlProvider.CreateControl         Return New SpecialTextBox     End Function End Class  Public Class SpecialTextBox     Inherits TextBox     Implements ISpecialControl     Public Sub New      End Sub End Class codepre  pI think this translates to C as p  precodepublic interface ISpecialControl    public interface IControlProvider      T CreateControlltTgt         where T  Control, ISpecialControl   public class SpecialTextBoxProvider  IControlProvider      public T CreateControlltTgt         where T  Control, ISpecialControl              return new SpecialTextBox        public class SpecialTextBox  TextBox, ISpecialControl   codepre  pThe attempt to return New SpecialTextbox fails due to an inability to cast SpecialTextbox to T.p  precodeValue of type MyApp.SpecialTextBox cannot be converted to T codepre  pI realize that my factories could be allowed to return simple controls and I could check at runtime if they implemented ISpecialControl, but this would yield runtime problems which I would rather check at compile time since it is a logical possibility even if not currently a practical one p  pUpdate The idea is that these factories could sit in external perhaps even third party assemblies and could take a dependency on any control libraries they wanted, creating and returning derivatives of these controls which also implemented ISpecialControl. p  pThese assemblies could be located through selfconfiguringreflection Reflection on first pass followed by configuration, which is then used on further runs and used without any knowledge by the calling assembly on what dependancy these controls would have taken.p  pIt does require that these factories are constructable without passing information about the control they are expected to call, since that would defeat the point.p  pstrongSo what do you think... Would this be useful... Is there a better way to achieve this Is there already a way to achieve thisstrongp

Negative 4645 pI dont know if this is even possible with PHP, but I figured if it is, someone here will know how.  Im currently working on a project where users can customize a full body main avatar to be used throughout the site.  There are a bunch of different face, hair, etc transparent png images that can be selected to make their custom avatar.  I have this working great, but here is the hard part.  I want to be able to use the face, hair, and beard if male, and automatically create an 80x80 image that will be used as their small avatar for forum posts, etc.p  pThere are a few obstacles with this.  First, all of the images are 187x404 big amounts of the image are transparent, the character body image is achieved by stacking the images, so a face image isnt actually that big.  For this to work, the images would effectively have to be automatically cropped so that all of the extra space was removed and the actual face, hair, or beard part showed in the 80x80 spot.p  pThe second issue is that some of the hair or beards when placed on the fullsize face image would extend past the 80x80 and be chopped off.  So the image would have to be pieced together at full size, and then resized to fit in 80x80.p  pI know the basic way of combining the 3 images into one a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1397377combine23transparentpngimagesontopofeachotherwithphphttpstackoverflow.comquestions1397377combine23transparentpngimagesontopofeachotherwithphpa, but that is as far as Ive gotten.  If Im crazy and this isnt possible then tell me.  Im probably way overcomplicating this, so if you see and obviously easier way to achieving this, I would love to hear it.p

I am trying to understand the finer points of coding style and why one way might be preferred over the other It seems that scenario 2 is better from an encapsulation point of view. But scenario 1 is more foolproof in that the boolean that is in the conditional comes from one place only, the global constant. You dont have to worry about a function call that while correctly receiving a parameter could pass in the wrong value. But scenario 2 seems worthwhile because you remove the dependency of the constant and can have the function behave more dynamically. Any thoughts on this Are there any other trade offs I am over looking p  pSame concept and question applied to objects and classes as well. But I just present the example in terms of a function for simplicity of the code example.p

Negative 4645 pI have the case where I have a public facing service sitting out on the internet and I would like the ability for the server to contact specifically design embedded devices that are sitting in normal home networks when required.p  pI know that the devices can poll the server to get updates etc but 1 There will be a lag between when server does something, and device polls for update and 2 There will be a lot of useless traffic over time generated.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions on how to do this My initial though is to have the embedded devices use UPNP to try and generate a port forward rule in the home router, and then register that port to the server. The server can then generate a HTTP request to that address http so that it will get routed etc without being blocked by firewalls etc along the way. If the device cant create the forward rule then it will resourt back to the polling method.p  pDoes this sound about right Anyone have any experience they could share with this sort of thing Client will be c on embedded linux, server .NET.p

Negative 4645 pI am trying to see witch one i like best, Tiny MCE or CKEditor. The problem that i am getting is that i need to add a custom toolbar button or extend the anchor button. Trying now to modify the advlink plugin to insert internal links from the CMS. So i modified the page link.htm and added one button next to the href field. This button opens up a small popup where the user can select an internal link in the CMS and then press insert. The small popup then uses javascript to send the result back to the link.htm page. The link is then inserted into the href field. My problem is that when i press insert on the link.htm page, it just reloads the page and nothing is inserted.p  pThis is the javascript that i added to the link.htm pagep  precode    function ShowInternalLinks          window.openInternalLink.aspx, InternalLink, toolbar0,status0,menubar0,location0,directories0,resizable0,scrollbar0,width400,height200          function InsertInternalLinklink          document.getElementByIdhref.value  1  link                  codepre  pNothing fancy, just opens up my custom aspx page when the ShowInternalLink is clicked. Then when the user clicks on insert on that page, the page calls the javascript InsertInternalLink and then closes the small popup. Everything works when i run the page, the href gets the correct value from the popup page, but when i then press insert, the page just reloads and the href field resets itself.p  pAny ideas If i write in the URL in the href field, it works perfectly. Just doesnt work when i use my popup windowp  pSide question Can this even be done easily in CKEditorp

Negative 4645 pThere are several useful answers on SO regarding prevention of brute forcing a password of a web service by applying throttling. I couldnt find any good numbers though and I have little expertise in this area, so the question isp  pHow many attempts does it usually take to bruteforce an average password of 6 or more characters with no additional knowledge that may help, but taking into account that passwords are probably prone to dictionary attacks and based on that, what are meaningful limits to apply to the throttling algorithm without disrupting the user experiencep  pThis is my current schemep  ul liThe login form uses a nonce, so the attacker has to wait for a complete request cycle to complete to both get the result of the login attempt and retrieve a new token.li lidelI allow the login form to be retrieved 50 times per IP with less than a minute between requests, after that the IP will be blocked for 1 minute. Any new attempts within this one minute will restart the timeout.delli lidelTheres a codesleepcode applied for each fetching of the login page of code of attempts  5code, so after 5 requests with less than a minute between requests itll take  1 second to fetch the form, after 10 requests  2 seconds, etc.delli lidelAdditionally, Im only allowing 100 failed login attempts per user account with 2 hours between attempts, after that the account is blocked for 2 hours.delli liTo avoid frequent DoSing of accounts, IPs can be whitelisted no limits applied or blacklisted any login attempt ignored completely.li ul  pstrongBased on the answers so far, I have tweaked it to work like thisstrongp  ul liRetrieving the login form is progressively slowed down on a per IP basis. Each new request is slept for code of requests  2code seconds. The counter is reset after 10 minutes of no login activity.li liIm keeping a FIFO stack of login attempts for each IP. If an IP fails to log in 30 times within 2 hours, its suspended. Im also keeping a list of number of suspensions per IP, and the suspension time is calculated as code2   of suspensions  1 hourscode. This should lead to a rapid de facto blacklisting of continually offending IPs.li liAdditionally, if an account failed to log in 20 times within one day its being suspended for 2 hours. Im not too sure about this measure yet, since this means accounts can be DoSd quite easily. Short of a massive distributed botnet though, offending IPs should become de facto blacklisted faster than an account can be permanently DoSd. Its also quite an effective measure to protect an account.li ul  pI think these limits should not harm normal users, even ones that regularly forget their password and try to log in several times. The IP limits should also work okay with heavily NATed users, given the average size of the service. Can somebody prove this to be efficient or inefficient with some solid math p
Negative 4645 pI have a class with an NSDictionary attribute. Inside this class I dispatch another thread to handle NSXMLParser handling. Inside my didStartElement, I access the dictionary in the class to compare an element found in the XML to one in the dictionary.p  pAt this point I get undefined results. Using NSLog Im not advanced in XCode debugging, I see that it bombs around access of the NSDictionary.

Negative 4645 pas a personal project I am trying to write a wiki with the help of django. Im a beginner when it comes to web development. I am at the early point where I need to decide how to store the wiki sites. I have three approaches in mind and would like to know your suggestion.p  h3Flat filesh3  pI considered a flat file approach with a version control system like git or mercurial. Firstly, I would have some example wikis to look at like a hrefhttphatta.sheep.art.pl relnofollowhttphatta.sheep.art.pla. Secondly, the vcs would probably deal with editing conflicts and keeping the edit history, so I would not have to reinvent the wheel. And thirdly, I could probably easily clone the wiki repository, so I or for that matter others can have an offline copy of the wiki.p  pOn the other hand, as far as I know, I can not use django models with flat files. Then, if I wanted to add fields to a wiki site, like a category, I would need to somehow keep a reference to that flat file in order to associate the fields in the database with the flat file. Besides, I dont know if it is a good idea to have all the wiki sites in one repository. I imagine it is more natural to have kind of like a repository per wiki site resp. file. Last but not least, Im not sure, but I think using flat files would limit my deploying capabilities because web hosts maybe dont allow creating files Im thinking, for example, of Google App Enginep  h3Storing in a databaseh3  pBy storing the wiki sites in the database I can utilize django models and associate arbitrary fields with the wiki site. I probably would also have an easier life deploying the wiki. But I would not get vcs features like history and conflict resolving per se. I searched for djangoextensions to help me and I found a hrefhttpcode.google.compdjangoreversion relnofollowdjangoreversiona. However, I do not fully understand if it fit my needs. Does it track model changes like for example if I change the django model file, or does it track the content of the models which would fit my need. Plus, I do not see if django reversion would help me with edit conflicts.p  h3Storing a vcs repository in a database fieldh3  pThis would be my ideal solution. It would combine the advantages of both previous approaches without the disadvantages. That is I would have vcs features but I would save the wiki sites in a database. The problem is I have no idea how feasible that is. I just imagine saving a wiki sitesource together with a gitmercurial repository in a database field. Yet, I somehow doubt database fields work like that.p  pSo, Im open for any other approaches but this is what I came up with.

Negative 4645 pI am using JBoss 5.1.0.GA on Red Hat Linux 4. We have only webservices deployed on this application server as .war files servlets only, no stateful applications present. As a part of our architecture change for improving scalability, we are planning to have multiple JBoss servers running may or may not be on different IPs and machines and have a load balancer in front of them to distribute the load.

Negative 4645 pIm trying to figure out the best place to put multiattribute search form logic in a Rails application. The search form in question has several attributes which may or may not have values, and the data types differ between attributes. For example, there are search options to search for items with a price attribute between two numbers, date ranges, string values, etc. Also, the model in question has several nested attributes through hasahasmany relationships and some of those attributes also need to be searchable. p  pThe Rails mantra of thick model, thin controller makes me hesitant to try to aggregate the search logic into the controller. However, it also doesnt seem appropriate to put logic relating to constructing the search conditions in the models. Finally, in the spirit of DRY, Im hesitant to hardcode a bunch of specific attribute names into some module since I will need to apply similar search logic to several unrelated models. Perhaps a naming convention of the form fields in the search view could be used to construct the right conditions Something like using prefixes like min, max, startdate indicating the data type and search condition operator and the suffix being the name of the model andor attributep  pIve searched for advice on this, but most of the advice seems inflexible hardcoded attribute names, no support for nested attributes or to use routebased searches which I dont think will work for my need where 510 parameters may be used in a search at once.p  pAny suggestions on the Rails way of doing thisp

Negative 4645 pI want to create a ListActivity with 2 modesp  p1 mode will have the ListView with some functionality for altering the list. 1 mode will have the ListView with no functionality.  The user may only view the list.p  pThere are several ways of designing this kind of behavior, but this is how I want it to lookp  pI want the user horizontally swiping the screen to switch between modes.  I also want an animation so it looks like one list is being scrolled off screen and the new one is scrolling onto the screen.p  pShould I...p  pA Have these actually be the same list.  One would just hide some of the buttons.  Using some animation, it would appear that a new list is being brought onto the screen.  My problem with this approach is that Im not really sure how to achieve such an animation.p  pB Have the swipe gesture launch a new Activity with a new ListView.  There is already the built in animation to slide the Activity into view and take it off by going back.  My problem with this is the lists would operate independent.  I would want the users to be in the same spot of the list in both modes and this isnt particularly easy to achieve.  You can jump to a position by asking the other list what its first visible position is, but it likely wont line up exactly as the other may.p  pLet me repeat that I do not want toggle buttons.  I want the swipe gesture to alter the mode and I want it to appear that a new list whether it is actually new or not slides into view.p  pIdeally, I would like a response on how to achieve the desired animation from option A, but I would also like to hear any other recommendations.p  pThanks for your helpp
Negative 4645 pIm wondering how static member variables are typically implemented in languages like C and Java and if their use affects the size of instantiated objects.  I know that a static members are shared by all instances of that class, but how is it shared  If it may affect object size, would having 10 static variables add more size than 1  Im asking because I can think of two ways it might be implemented  adding a pointer to static data to each object similar to the way some implementations add a pointer to the virtual function table, or another way might be that the static data is just referenced directly like a global variable with the offset being resolved by the linker  loader.p

Negative 4645 pBy browser rendering performance I mean things like scrolling, moving elements in animated fashion, zorder changes.p  pIn particular I get tremendous slowdown in Firefox 3.6 and IE8 when I move an image with top, left styles over my page. I have no problems with Chrome 8.p  pWith firebug I tried hiding page elements one by one and the largest improvent by far came from the page wide background Jpeg that I use. I wonder how is it affecting performance as the image is moving above another element that obscures the background. This another element is partly transparent PNG but not in the part the movement happens, maybe this has something to do with it I use a lot of transparency and CSS3 effects and somehow they slow down everything, even things that look completely unrelated.p  pOverall I get the impression that the browser is rerendering the whole page when something is moving, instead of only the affected pixels.p  pAny educated guess as to why all this happensp  pstrongEDITstrong Any picture or text that sits below my moving image causes it to slow down a lot when passing over it.

Negative 4645 pI was using until now emacs21 with git.el, so it was not a problem but now with emacs22 git management is integrated in VC so I manage my git files with vcgit. That is ok when the files are only manged by git. I can see a codeGITmastercode in the status. But when I am editing files managed by both svn for the stable commits and group VC and git for my own and inbetween commits I dont know how to force the commits to be done with git the status say that is a svn file. Any idea p  pI can always use the codeM git statuscode codeM git addcode etc but having the VC shortcuts and integrating the diff in emacs is very nice.p  pnote I am not using gitsvn at the moemnt. This is an already svn branch checkout that I want to have some experimental changes been controlled by git until the code becomes stable, instead of doing a svn subbranch. I believe that the gitsvn would be the way to go but unfortunately I need to find the time to read about it and install whatever is needed. So I am using what I already know that is simple git.p

Whether the OS will show the alerts one by one [If user keeps on closing the alerts] or it will lauch the app if any view action is clicked by the user, If so what about the rest of the alerts  If the application is launched , will it provide the notification object that lauches the app or we can able to access all the notification alerts that are in the queue.p  pHelp me out what will be the process if an appnot running receives more than 1 notification  with possible options ViewClosep

Negative 4645 pId like to implement some sort of singleton pattern in my Python program. I was thinking of doing it without using classes that is, Id like to put all the singletonrelated functions and variables within a module and consider it an actual singleton.p  pFor example, say this is to be in the file singletonmodule.pyp    pre classlangpy prettyprintoverridecode singletonmodule.py   Singletonrelated variables foo  blah bar  stuff   Functions that process the above variables def worksomeparameter     global foo, bar     if someparameter         bar  ...     else         foo  ... codepre  pThen, the rest of the program i.e., other modules would use this singleton like sop    pre classlangpy prettyprintoverridecode anothermodule.py  import singletonmodule   process the singleton variables,  which changes them across the entire program singletonmodule.work...   freely access the singleton variables  at least for reading print singletonmodule.foo codepre  pThis seemed to be a pretty good idea to me, because it emlooksem pretty clean in the modules that use the singleton.p  pHowever, all these tedious global statements in the singleton module are ugly. They occur in every function that processes the singletonrelated variables. Thats not much in this particular example, but when you have 10 variables to manage across several functions, its not pretty.p  pAlso, this is pretty errorprone if you happen to forget the global statements variables local to the function will be created, and the modules variables wont be changed, which is not what you wantp  pSo, would this be considered to be clean Is there an approach similar to mine that manages to do away with the global messp  pOr is this simply not the way to gop

Negative 4645 pWe are now using Django to develop a multilingual website. We have different language version for content on our website. For example, for a post, we have English and Espanish version. Currently we are using this modelp  precodeclass Postmodels.Model     user     title     detail     countfollower     ...     orginallanguage     date   class PostEspanishmodels.Model     post  models.ForeignKeyPost     title     detail codepre  pSo we use Post for all English content and PostEspanish for Espanish content. If someone writes a post in English we just put it in Post model, and we put translated post in PostEspanish model. And if someone writes a post in Espanish, we first create a Post instance, then create a PostEspanish instance and put content in PostEspanish, and if someone translate this Espanish post, we put translated post in its refering Post.p  pStoring different language content on different model is because the search guy want it this way. He says it is good for the search.p  pTo make it clearer, for instance, some user writes a post, we will do the followingp  precodeif language  English     post  Post.objects.create..., orginallanguageenglish else     post  Post.objects.create..., originallanguageespanish     PostEspanish.objects.createpostpost, ... codepre  pand translatesp  precodepost  Post.objects.getidid if post.orginallanguage  english     post  post.postespanish     update post     post.save else     update post     post.save codepre  pToday some dude jumped out and said this model design really sucks.

Negative 4645 pIm currently generating code intended for a C compiler. Im generating a class that will take a visitor object, call the accept method on it with several objects. However, I want the visitor to have the ability to break, that is, the visitor should have a way of indicating that it wants to stop the rest of the accept calls because its lost interest.p  pI see two ways to accomplish this, and strongassuming the compiler has full visibility of the dispatching class methods and the visitors methodsstrong so inlining is possible, Im curious which way is easier for the compiler to optimize. Obviously, different compilers will produce different results, but Id like my code generator to produce code emthat requires the least amount of sophisticationem from the compiler to produce fast code.p  pThe first way is to generate a doVisiting method that expects the Accept method on the visitor indicating whether it should continuep  precodetemplateltclass VisitorTgt void doVisitingVisitorTamp visitor      ifvisitor.acceptobject1          ifvisitor.acceptobject2              ifvisitor.acceptobject3                  visitor.acceptobject4                             codepre  pOne advantage of this way is that if any the accept methods are hardcoded to return false or true, I expect the compilers constant propogation would kick in would prune the if checks and accept calls. I think this is a reasonable assumption because constant propogation is something pretty much any optimizing compiler has to implement.p  pThe second way would be not pay attention to the return type, and count on the visitor to maintain a bool internally indicating whether it wants to accept the rest of the iterations. At the top of its accept method it would check the bool to decide whether to do any processingp  precodestruct myvisitor      bool stop     void acceptobjecttype1amp o              ifstop             return           do work           void acceptobjecttype2amp o              ifstop             return           do work          ifsomebreakworthycondition              if we were returning bool instead of void,              we would have a return false here.             stop  true            .. other accept methods  codepre  pIn the first method the ifs are outside the accept calls, and the second way the ifs are inside them. The second also necessarily involves storing a bit of state. My intuition is that the latter requires more sophisticated analysis, but maybe I underestimate compilers.p  pIt also goes without saying Im interested in other suggestions compilers would handle even better p
Negative 4645 pDoing some exercises with simple file encryptiondecryption and am currently just reading in a bunch of bytes and performing the appropriate bitoperations on each byte one at a time, then writing them to the output file.p  pThis method seems pretty slow. For example, if I want to XOR every byte by 0xFF, I would loop over each byte and XOR by 0xFF, rather than do some magic and every byte is XORd quickly.p  pAre there better ways to perform bit operations rather than a byte at a timep
Negative 4645 pI have a website where people send each other messages Recently I noticed that sometimes the same message is sent more than once For example, a message is sent four times within three seconds or twice within a second I do not understand how this could happen, once the user clicks on the button that sends the message So all the window switches and a message showup saying the mail is sent successfully. I checked that if the user refreshes the page after it sends a message, then really the message is sent again. But I do not think thats the case, becouse the message is sent twice within one second.

Negative 4645 pSorry for the long post the output is quite large. Recently i started testing out C and WPF and im really enjoying the creativity and freedom it offers for visual effects. I started converting the functions of an application i am currently working on into a DLL mostly so i dont have to redo the work I have already done and because i want to learn and gain some experience in writing DLLs and using interop.p  pEvery function so far has only had a single input or output. However my final two functions Which take a list of filenames and the hash of the file its self and for each file and hash saves it to an xml file arent working so well for me. Im getting output but not in the form i want it so obviously my logic is flawed but im not sure how to correct it.p  pThe functions are very similar the only difference is the one creates a brand new xml while the second updates an existing xml. They both worked perfectly before as straight CCLI functions however now that i need to use them in C i have to put them in iterations so they work for each of the files and their hashes displayed in the lists.p  pBelow is one of the functions in the Dll where i have now replaced the previous hardcoded variables which would have been listBox2Items[x]ToString as varibales such as CurrentFile which are now defined in the .cs.p  precodepublic void XMLUpdateString Location, int NumberItems, String ProjectName,                  String ProjectTC, String CurrentFile, String CurrentHash

Negative 4645 pHi Im working with a view pager and fragments. I would like to override orientation changes so that the onCreateView method isnt run everytime the orientation changes. This is because a lot is run in onCreateView for my app which causes the orientation to be slow to change. Also things on my server are checked and what not too so there really is no reason for all of it to run just because the orientation changed. p  pHere is what ive set up so farp  pI have this on the MainActivity in the manifestp  precode androidconfigChangesorientationkeyboardHidden codepre  pAnd then i am using this in my fragmentp  precodeOverride public void onConfigurationChangedConfiguration newConfig    super.onConfigurationChangednewConfig     getLayoutInflatergetArguments.inflateR.layout.main, null, false     Toast.makeTextgetActivity, changed orientation, Toast.LENGTHLONG.show  codepre  pWhen i run the app and switch orientation i see the toast show but the layout never changes to the landscape one. So I decided that maybe android just wasnt recognizing that it was in landscape since i overrided it but changing the layout to something ridiculous like a layout for a dialog doesnt cause a force close or anything it stays the portrait layout which is stretched as a result so i know there is something wrong with how im inflating the layout.p  pAny help on changing the layout when orientation is changed in a viewpager would be greatly appreciated.p  pThank youp

Negative 4645 pId like to add some kind of library, or maven plugin, or something to combine and compress my javascript and css source files.p  pHowever, I think this is pretty difficult to do unobtrusively with Java. The Rails people have pretty much solved this problem... it uses the unjoineduncompressed files for development and then it compresses everything during production. It does this unobtrusively as you dont have to change your html headers or anything like that  it works for both testing and production. This is more or less what I want. Does it even exist in the Java spacep  pThe last thing I want is to comment and uncomment lines of freemarkerhtml code for development and production  I want everything to be the same. Ideally, Id want to be able to leave Tomcat running and code my javascript and css, and see my changes instantly  no delays or hickups. I also dont want to have to manually run a command to generate the new javascript every time I make a change... or even have some daemon constantly update it because then it might not be instantaneous when Im testing. At the same time, if Im going to package up my war for production, I want it to use the joined and compressed files instead.p  pIs this even possible If so, what tool should I be looking at I know there are quite a few that do some of this, but theyve fallen short on the unobtrusive aspect.p  pThanksp

Negative 4645 pAs far as I know, the codequartz.netcode scheduler is started in the codeglobal.asaxcode. Thats to say, codequartz.netcode scheduler does not work unless someone visits the website. This is not a safe way because the scheduler thread can be killed by rebooting server or the process in the IIS pool being terminated, and the scheduler thread will remain unstarted until someone visits the website again.p  pWe could use windows scheduler to solve this problem. But we are using a strongshared hoststrong and we cannot write a service or a sql server job or schedule a windows task on the host.p  pIf we are sure that our site be visited every day, this is not a problem.

Negative 4645 pOkay, so I have this Silverlight client program. strongIm not allowed to use the web projectstrong, but I do need to be able to read from an SQL database for my data.p  pSome internet searching brought me to LINQ to SQL and the System.Data.Linq.DataContext object, as well as SQLMetal.exe. I have created my data context object from the meta data in a remote SQL database and the code looks okay from what I can tell  all the right names and types seem to be there. p  pWhat I wanted to do was add this into Silverlight, but I realised, on importing the code, that you cant use System.Data in a Silverlight application, which sort of rules out having this code in the Silverlight client itself. Now this is annoying because a DataContext quite conveniently comes with properties which are tables and such like I find those really convenient in Silverlight.p  pSo I cant do it the normal way. I can do it with a WCF service, but... well, heres where I could use some advice. I can create a WCF service with asynch calls, but Im not really sure in what way to wire up the DataContext object. I mean... I need access to the classes in there within my Silverlight application for my entities in the database and Im not quite sure how to do that  help there would be appreciated. Then to synchronise it all up Well, I could use some suggestions. For example, before, I have an exposed ObservableCollection. In its getter, it repopulated itself with the contents of, for example, Context.Customers. This made things nice and easy, but I cant see a way of doing something like that now. If I made a call to an asynch service for every get, surely this would be unacceptably slow.p  pIf you could help me pick my way through this, I would be grateful. Thanks.p
Negative 4645 pI would like to compress scanned text monochrome or few colours and store it in pdf maybe djvu files. I remember that I got very good results with WindowsAcrobat and ZRLE compressed monochrome tiff embedded into pdf. The algorithm was loossless as far as I remember. Now I search a way to obtain good results on linux. It should be storage saving and avoid loss I do not mind loosing colours, but I do not want e.g. jpeg compression which would create noisy results for text scans. I need it for batch conversion, so I was thinking of the ImageMagick convert command. But which output format should I use so I get good results and to be able to embed it into pdf files for example using pdflatex Or is it generally better to use djvu filesp

Negative 4645 pUpon building an MVC framework in PHP I ran into a problem which could be solved easily using Java style generics. An abstract Controller class might look something like thisp  precodeabstract class Controller   abstract public function addModelModel model codepre  pThere may be a case where a subclass of class Controller should only accept a subclass of Model. For example ExtendedController should only accept ReOrderableModel into the addModel method because it provides a reOrder method that ExtendedController needs to have access top  precodeclass ExtendedController extends Controller   public function addModelReOrderableModel model  codepre  pIn PHP the inherited method signature has to be exactly the same so the type hint cannot be changed to a different class, even if the class inherits the class type hinted in the superclass. In java I would simply do thisp  precodeabstract class ControllerltTgt   abstract public addModelT model   class ExtendedController extends ControllerltReOrderableModelgt   public addModelReOrderableModel model  codepre  pBut there is no generics support in PHP. Is there any solution which would still adhere to OOP principlesp  pstrongEditstrong I am aware that PHP does not require type hinting at all but it is perhaps bad OOP. Firstly it is not obvious from the interface the method signature what kind of objects should be accepted. So if another developer wanted to use the method it should be obvious that objects of type X are required without them having to look through the implementation method body which is bad encapsulation and breaks the information hiding principle. Secondly because theres no type safety the method can accept any invalid variable which means manual type checking and exception throwing is needed all over the placep

This led me to look into having an onResume method, and after some trial and error, I ended up calling the code to associate the view with adapter in onResume.

Negative 4645 pIve done up a bit of code in which I attempt to integrate data tables httpdatatables.net with cakePHP.p  pIts up and running with my own app, but I want to make it more generic, so it can be used by anyone across any cakePhp application, and most importantly I want it to fit in with cakePHP conventions.p  pSo at the moment this is what I have...p  pA cakePHP helper called codedataTablescode, which takes the following arguments codemodelNamecode, codefieldscode, codeheaderscode.p  ul licodemodelNamecode is the name of the model whose data will be populating the table.li licodefieldscode is an array of fields we want to show in the table all fields must be prepended with ModelName. which means we can show associated model values in the tableli licodeheaderscode is a list of headers we want to be displayed at the top of the table.li ul  pThe helper produces an empty html table with the codeheaderscode as headers. The table is then populated by datables javascript you might have to read up on a hrefhttpdatatables.netreleasedatatablesexamplesserversideserverside.html relnofollowthisa if youre not familiar with dataTables serverside processing.p  pThe Javascript retrieves the table data from the codedataTablecode action of the controller whose model we want to get at. The javascript will also send the model name which we sent to the helper, and the fields. The controller then prints out the JSON data through a blank viewp  pMy two main questions arep  ol lipIt doesnt seem right to place the dataTable action in a controller. A because it doesnt actually need the controller because it knows what model and fields it needs to load and B because its not really a stronguserstrong action, its really just a JSON response. So where should it be putpli lipTo print the JSON repsonse for my codedataTablecode action, I use a codeblank.ctpcode view and the use codeecho jsonencodeoutputcode. It doesnt seem right to use a view to output JSON data. Usually views are just for the user rightpli ol  pOne way of answering both of these questions is to have a standalone codedataTable.phpcode file, which will print the relevant JSON data based on the model name and fields it receives. But this  doesnt seem logical considering the MVC pattern.p  pThe code is a bit messy at the moment answers to the above should help me tidy it up but let me know if need to see.p  pHope this makes sense to someone other then myself..p

Negative 4645 pI have an application that first loads some data into an UIManagedDocument, then executes codesaveToURLforSaveOperationcompletionHandlercode. Inside the completionHandler block, it does an update of various elements of this database, and when its done, it does another saving.  p  pBesides that, the app has 3 buttons that reload the data, reupdate the data, and delete one entity of the database, respectively. In every button method, the last instruction is a saving as well.  p  pWhen I run all this in the simulator, all goes smoothly. But in the device doesnt. It constantly crashes. I have observed that, normally, it crashes when pressing the delete button, or when reloading or reupdating the database. And its always in the codesaveToURLcode operation.br In my opinion, the problem comes when there are strongmultiple threadsstrong saving the database. As the device executes the code slower, maybe multiple savings come at same time and the app cant handle them correctly.

Inside the clients there is a thread listening and a thread sending.p

Negative 4645 pOur company has recently been signed up with a franchise to provide their customers our POS cash register application, leading us to have about 35 new sign ups every week. Currently we create a duplicate copy of the applications database for every new customer, but I can tell already that this approach could end up crushing us. We were thinking maybe itd be best to use one database for all clinics identified by some form of client id on each table.p  pNow we got into a bit of a debate on that topic one coworker was saying having a large table with 50,000 will make things too slow, and wed have to optimize the entire application. Another coworker was saying MySQL was designed to handle large databases, and as long as you specify the client id in each queries WHERE clause then youll receive a subset of the data, with practically no change in speed.p  pWill selecting a subset of data from a large table 100,000 have any significant speed difference from selecting the same number of rows from a smaller tablep  pAlso, any recommendations on which way to go for the database design would be much appreciated.p

Negative 4645 pIm developing a ruby application that uses the models and data from another Ruby on Rails web application as its main data source.p  pThe Rails models were included in this application by including the codeenvironment.rbcode file in the main file like thisp  precode Require Rails  requirerelative ....RailsAppconfigenvironment.rb codepre  pThis works but there are uninitialized dependencies when loading models that use gems that are defined in the Rails Gemfile. For example, codeactsastaggableon, rackpjax, devisecode, etcp  pThis ruby application dependencies are also managed through Bundler, so at the moment the only way to get the application working is to copy and paste the contents from the Rails Gemfile into the ruby apps Gemfile.p  pObviously this approach is not optimal as the gem requirements are duplicated. p  pIs there a better way to include Rails and the dependencies that its models require in another application Is there a way to include a Gemfile into anotherp
Negative 4645 pIm having a bit of trouble with jQuery Deferred.p  pIm using a jQuery ajax call inside a function wrapper, and Im attempting to chain two success callbacks one after the other, in order of scope. However, both success callbacks are executing simultaneously, which is causing problems.p  pMy initial function call looks like this system.log is a smarter console.log.p  precodeserverpaths.setConfigpath.thensystem.logBAM SERVERPATHS   serverpaths codepre  pInside this setConfig method, I have an AJAX call with a .then chained to it. system.defer is a wrapper that returns a jQuery.Deferred object http.get is a wrapper for jQuery.ajax.p  precodeconfig.setConfig  function configObj      var that  this     var inlineHelper  function data          return system.deferfunction dfd              for var key in data                  system.logConfig[  key  ]   that[key]                 system.logData[  key  ]   data[key]                 that[key]  data[key]                 system.logNew Config[  key  ]   that[key]                      .promise           if typeof configObj  string          http.getapigetPathConfig              The problem seems to be in this area             .thenfunction data                  return system.deferfunction                       inlineHelperdata                 .promise                   else          return system.deferfunction               inlineHelperconfigObj         .promise       codepre  pIdeally, the ajax request should be called, then inlinehelper should be called, then system.log should be called, because Im kicking my promise object back up the chain with return statements. The problem here is that the ajax request is called, and then system.log and inlinehelper are called simultaneously.p  pHas anyone run into a problem like this before Function scope and async calls seem to be fighting each other here. Im sure I can figure this out, but it doesnt seem quite logical  my guess is that when my ajax request fires its success, that triggers the .then call in my main scope without me wanting it to. Im sure I could solve this, but it helps to have a great community of devs to bounce thoughts off of.p  pI appreciate all of your advice. Thank youp

Negative 4645 pIm having a problem retaining POST variables on refresh. I have a page that contains numerous photos, each with a checkbox. When the checkbox is checked, a div opens with various sizes for photo prints. There is a select menu that accompanies each size print, and the user can select 110 prints. The user selects the desired photos and number of prints at each size, and submits the form.p  pThen, a dowhile loop is used to output all of the selected printsquanties think of this as a review your selections type of page. This works perfectly using the following codep  precode do    ltphp    varHolder  rowphotors[photoid]   var4x6  POST[varHolder4x6]   var5x7  POST[varHolder5x7]   var8x10  POST[varHolder8x10]   var8x12  POST[varHolder8x12]   var11x14  POST[varHolder11x14]   var12x18  POST[varHolder12x18]   var16x20  POST[varHolder16x20]   var20x30  POST[varHolder20x30]   varWallet  POST[varHolderwallet]   gt  while ....... codepre  pTo give you a better idea of what is going on there, this is an example of an input field for a photo this is part of the form that is passed over to the next page containing the code abovep  precode    ltselect nameltphp echo rowphotors[photoid] gt4x6gt         ltoption value0gt0ltoptiongt         ltoption value1gt1ltoptiongt         ltoption value2gt2ltoptiongt         ltoption value3gt3ltoptiongt         ltoption value4gt4ltoptiongt         ltoption value5gt5ltoptiongt         ltoption value6gt6ltoptiongt         ltoption value7gt7ltoptiongt         ltoption value8gt8ltoptiongt         ltoption value9gt9ltoptiongt         ltoption value10gt10ltoptiongt     ltselectgt codepre  pNotice that that the name field for the select box is the photoid, and then 4x6. This same thing happens for the other various sizes. So the loop goes through the photoids and determines how many of each photo is ordered at each size. Once the loop finishes with the first photoid, it loops to the next one, resetting the value for varHolder in the process. This, in turn, changes the quantity of each size for that specific photo.p  pAgain, this all works fine, but if a refresh happens, its all lost. How do I retain everything in the output Its not part of a form, but simply output to the screen. Ive looked at some similar questions, and it seems like maybe an array of some type is the answer, but I couldnt make sense of what to do in relation to my exact problem. Any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 4645 pSo I am little confused on how to store a list of phone numbers in one column. Here are the requirementsp  ol liUsers can have more than one phone number.li liPhone numbers have to be unique, so if user A added a phone number that is used by user B then a validation error should be displayed.li liA default phone number should be selected if the user have more than one phone number.li liSolution have to be compatible with Postgresql.li ol  pI thought up of four possible solutionsp  ol liHStore making a codephonenumbercode field that stores a hash of all the phone numbers. e.g. code1gt18001231234, 2gt9237492734, defaultgt1code. In this case I need to make lot of queries to make sure that a new phone number is unique, for example I need to query codeUser.wherephonenumber gt 1 gt 18001231234code then check in 2 codeUser.wherephonenumber gt 2 gt 18001231234code ... etc.li liArray of phone numbers in one field codephonenumbercode will store comma separated phone numbers like 18001231234,9237492734. Checking a existing phone number would be easy codeUser.wherephonenumber LIKE 18001231234code but will take a lot of time for the database to pick it up. codedefaultphonecode will be added to the table as well or making the first phone number as the default one by convention.li liLimiting phone numbers to 3 which is enough and creating codephonenumber1code, codephonenumber2code and codephonenumber3code fields. Checking the uniqueness of a phone number will consume 3 queries. Also will require adding codedefaultphonecode.li liAdding a new table codephonenumberscode idinteger, useridinteger, phonenumberstring, defaultboolean and setting hasmany relationship with User model. Which is not really seducing ... create a whole table for 1 field. But it have fast lookups and will have limitless phone numbers for each user.li ol  pAny ideas, hints and suggestions are greatly appreciated.p

Negative 4645 pI am setting up a Maven repository with the goal of automating much of my build and deploy process.  My current workflow begins with bringing up a server, doing a codegit clonecode, and running a bunch of codemvn installcode commands to complete the top level application.p  pTo my understanding, Maven is not a tool for deploying applications, and at this point I do not see a need for a continuous integration or continuous deployment server or formal process.p  pHowever, thus far I have not been able to find a canonical way to put together the complete, runnable program together with Maven.p  pThis script goes so far as to get the top level jar and install it into the local maven repop  precodemvn DgroupIdme.company DartifactIdTopLevelApplication Dversion1.0SNAPSHOT   DrepoUrlhttptheserver8081nexus dependencyget codepre  pIf I installed everything manually, this application would find all of its dependent jars in a codelibcode directory, as Maven ought to do.  However this jar as pulled is not deployable  while the dependent jars are installed to a local repo they are not compiled where the classpath expects it.p  pI imagine if I could rig the above script to pull the codepom.xmlcode instead of just the jar and run a codemvn installcode on that, everything would go smoothly although weirdly that seems to be duplicating the last step of the build process.  Another option is for applications to contain all dependent jars rolled up into one giant jar and have no external dependencies.p  pWhich of these or other options is the proper way to complete the Maven build processp  pHere is our toplevel pom narrowed down to as much as I can think would be relevantp  precodeltprojectgt ltmodelVersiongt4.0.0ltmodelVersiongt ltgroupIdgtme.companyltgroupIdgt ltartifactIdgtTopLevelApplicationltartifactIdgt ltpackaginggtjarltpackaginggt ltversiongt1.0SNAPSHOTltversiongt ltnamegtTop Level Applicationltnamegt lturlgthttpcompany.melturlgt  ltpropertiesgt     ltproject.build.sourceEncodinggtUTF8ltproject.build.sourceEncodinggt ltpropertiesgt  ltdistributionManagementgt     ltrepositorygt         ltidgtreleasesltidgt         lturlgthttphost8081nexuscontentrepositoriesreleaseslturlgt     ltrepositorygt     ltsnapshotRepositorygt         ltidgtsnapshotsltidgt         ltnamegtInternal Snapshotsltnamegt         lturlgthttphost8081nexuscontentrepositoriessnapshotslturlgt     ltsnapshotRepositorygt ltdistributionManagementgt  ltbuildgt     ltsourceDirectorygtsrcltsourceDirectorygt     ltpluginsgt         ltplugingt             ltgroupIdgtorg.apache.maven.pluginsltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtmavencompilerpluginltartifactIdgt             ltversiongt2.5.1ltversiongt             ltconfigurationgt                 ltsourcegt1.7ltsourcegt                 lttargetgt1.7lttargetgt             ltconfigurationgt         ltplugingt         ltplugingt             ltgroupIdgtorg.apache.maven.pluginsltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtmavenjarpluginltartifactIdgt             ltversiongt2.4ltversiongt             ltconfigurationgt                 ltarchivegt                     ltmanifestgt                         ltaddClasspathgttrueltaddClasspathgt                         ltclasspathPrefixgtlibltclasspathPrefixgt                         ltmainClassgtme.company.application.MainClassltmainClassgt                     ltmanifestgt                 ltarchivegt             ltconfigurationgt         ltplugingt         ltplugingt             ltgroupIdgtorg.apache.maven.pluginsltgroupIdgt             ltartifactIdgtmavendependencypluginltartifactIdgt             ltversiongt2.4ltversiongt             ltexecutionsgt                 ltexecutiongt                     ltidgtcopyltidgt                     ltphasegtcompileltphasegt                     ltgoalsgt                         ltgoalgtcopydependenciesltgoalgt                     ltgoalsgt                     ltconfigurationgt                         ltoutputDirectorygt                             project.build.directorylib                         ltoutputDirectorygt                     ltconfigurationgt                 ltexecutiongt             ltexecutionsgt         ltplugingt     ltpluginsgt ltbuildgt ltdependenciesgt     ltdependencygt         ltgroupIdgtme.companyltgroupIdgt         ltartifactIdgtFirstLibraryltartifactIdgt         ltversiongt1.0SNAPSHOTltversiongt     ltdependencygt     lt more inhouse libraries gt     lt third party libraries  Apache Commons, javamail, etc. gt ltdependenciesgt ltprojectgt codepre

Negative 4645 pIve been reading everything I can find on here about this topic but am still not sure the best way to proceed. I have a heavy codeUIImageViewcode that uses an array of fat codeUIImagescode acting as an animated loop. This codeUIImageViewcode is serving as the background for every screen in the app. Clients request, not mine, so dont hate. Weve optimized the png files as small as they can go but its still a pretty heavy load.p  pIve read several posts about how codeUIImagecode searches the cache for an existing image of that name Ex. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4122726shareduiimageviewforbackgroundimagethroughoutappsingletonpropertyShared UIImageView for background image throughout app  Singleton Propertya but this doesnt seem to be happening. Ive also been reading here about singletons and instantiating in the appdelegate but Im not sure if either of these are the right way to proceed.p  pWhats the best way to load the codeUIImageViewcode once over the life of the app and use it in the background of every viewcontroller Btw, because it takes several seconds to load, Im going to be adding a loading page at app start that uses a single static image and an activity indicator.p  pAlso, Im not as familiar with testing and performance tools. Which one should I be using to test performance and make sure this is what is causing the hesitations throughout the appp  pApologies in advance for the noob questions  I generally avoid asking questions at all but sometimes, as in this case, I dont even know where to begin the research.p

Negative 4645 pI must be doing something wrong.  I have tried rendering an image to a PDF to both a pdfContext in iOS and a PDF using PDFSharp.  When I do it, its blurry compared to when I open it up in Photoshop or Microsofts picture preview.  So maybe I dont understand what is going on with the image itself.  Here is what I knowp  pImage size is 90 x 20 w x h.  The resolution is 264 ppi.  p  pTo draw it in PDFSharp, I dop  precodeXImage image  XImage.FromGdiPlusImageProperties.Resources.logo gphx.DrawImageimage, leftStartDefault, 50, image.PointWidth, image.PointHeight codepre  pI have also tried image.PixelWidth, image.PixelHeight in the above code.  Both produce the same blurry result.  p  pIn iOS, I dop  precodeUIImage logo  [UIImage imageNamedlogo.png] [logo drawInRectCGRectMakeself.frame.size.width  90  60, 20, 90, 20] codepre  pBoth produce blurry results.  Im not sure why.  I dont know if its something I am missing with how to choose the size to draw.  If I need to ask for a different resolutionsize image from our graphics artist, or if its the way I make the drawing call.  If I draw the image at half the size, it is clearer.p  pe.g.p  precodegphx.DrawImageimage, leftStartDefault, 50, 45, 10 codepre  pAny thoughts  thanks.p

Negative 4645 pWe are using server side validation of the payment like so   p  ol liUser makes payment.li liStore kit API sends transaction receipt to App.li liApp sends base64 encoded transaction receipt to our server. li liOur server calls a hrefhttpsbuy.itunes.apple.comverifyReceipthttpsbuy.itunes.apple.comverifyReceipta and validates the transaction recept.li liUser is marked as paid.li ol  pFor a particular user, we didnt get the transaction receipt at the server, due to which the receipt couldnt be verified.

Negative 4645 pI am making a real time graph with values that come in via serial communication.  I have the data coming in called my Celsius value.  I am displaying that on the GUI in a JLabel, so the value constantly changes.  The problem I am having is I want to have buttons that can change the value in the JLabel to Fahrenheit or back to Celsius.  So right now, I have my actionPerformed calling the updateTemp method so it will update the JLabel right away when the program beings.  I have the code below for the 3 methods I think need to be changed around.p  precodepublic void actionPerformedfinal ActionEvent e      updateTempC     final Double n  serial.x     series.addOrUpdatenew Millisecond, n     Object source  e.getSource      if e.getSource  buttonF      degree.setTextdegrees F      updateTempF          if e.getSource  buttonC      degree.setTextdegrees C      updateTempC        public void updateTempF     int step1     int step2     int step3     String indata  serial.temp     int temp  Integer.parseIntindata     step1  temp9     step2  step15     step3  step2  32     String indata1  Integer.toStringstep3     this.realtime.setTextindata1   public void updateTempC     String indata  serial.temp     this.realtime.setTextindata   codepre  pRight now when I press the JButton to change to Fahrenheit, it changes for a second but then goes right back to displaying Celsius because the graph is updated every second and the actionPerformed will go right back to calling the updateTempC.  I am wondering how, when I hit the button for Fahr. or Cels., it will change for the rest of the time.  THanksp

Negative 4645 pa hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvYxtZzw32r5s relnofollowVideo of the issue hereap  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comchrisbanesAndroidPullToRefresh relnofollowLink to the libraryap  pThe video might be a little hard to see, but what is happening is the content in the ScrollView is clipping strangely when I add a new fragment to the Activity. Instead of smoothly animating down, creates an extra margin of about 55 px on a 720 x 1280 phone, then corrects itself once the animation completes. p  pI dug around the source code and found that if I comment these two methods out of the onSizeChanged method of the PullToRefreshBase class, the animations will work correctlyp  precodeOverride protected final void onSizeChangedint w, int h, int oldw, int oldh      if DEBUG          Log.dLOGTAG, String.formatonSizeChanged. W d, H d, w, h           super.onSizeChangedw, h, oldw, oldh      TODO both of these methods below combined cause the glitchy issue       We need to update the headerfooter when our size changes     refreshLoadingViewsSize       Update the Refreshable View layout     refreshRefreshableViewSizew, h      TODO both of these methods above combined cause the glitchy issue             As were currently in a Layout Pass, we need to schedule another one       to layout any changes weve made here           postnew Runnable          Override         public void run              requestLayout                codepre  pThe refreshLoadingViewsSize and refreshRefreshableViewSize methods are what cause the problem, together. But, when I comment them out, the PullToRefresh functionality doesnt work anymore. This is because the first method, which sets the header size, isnt being called. This means the header height is always 0, which breaks the pulldown functionality, which relies on the height of the header to work. Furthermore the header itself wont even show up, and that doesnt work.p  pCommenting just one out will make the clipping problem even worse, unfortunately.p  pI also tried a hacky fix, where I run those two methods only on the first call of onSizeChanged, and ignore them afterwards. Like thisp  precodeifmFirstGo       We need to update the headerfooter when our size changes     refreshLoadingViewsSize       Update the Refreshable View layout     refreshRefreshableViewSizew, h      mFirstGo  false  codepre  pThis works great except for one problem. When the fragment is added, the padding is incorrectly set so that the content of the ScrollView is higher than it should be. This is because the padding is set the first time, but then is never reset again. Its like if the padding is 0 the entire time that isnt a problem, but if it is set at first, it needs to continue to be reset each time the view size changes.p  pI think the cause of this issue is the padding change happening independently of the view change, but Im not exactly sure. If anyone has some insight here Id really appreciate it. Thanksp

The reason Ive been led to believe it might be related to the picturebox, is because as soon as I turn the stopCapturing bool to true, memory stops rising, even if Im moving the window around the screen. stopCapturing is not used for anything else, and the event continues triggering as normal, the only difference is the image being displayed in the picturebox. Im at a loss as to the cause, so any help would be appreciated.p  pPS Not sure if its related, but my workstation has 2 screens.p

But the 1st one stays active all the way.p  precodefinal OnClickListener clickListener  new OnClickListener               private Button buttonClicked              public void onClickView v                  Button button  Button v                 button.getBackground.setColorFilternew LightingColorFilter0xFFFFFFFF, 0x003333                  if buttonClicked  null                       first button is clicked                     buttonClicked  button               else if buttonClicked.getParent  button.getParent                       second button is clicked                     if buttonClicked.getTag.equalsbutton.getTag                          Toast.makeTextSpojnice.this, Correct, Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show                         button.getBackground.setColorFilternew LightingColorFilter0xFFFFFFFF, 0x66FF33                         buttonClicked.getBackground.setColorFilternew LightingColorFilter0xFFFFFFFF, 0x66FF33                         buttonClicked.setEnabledfalse                         button.setEnabledfalse                      else                          Toast.makeTextSpojnice.this, Wrong, Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show                                        buttonClicked  null                                             codepre  pSo, on the screenshow below I first pressed Aquarius then Pisces then Crux then Aquila and in the end Vodolija. So it remembered all the way my first click and then once it met condition that they are not from the same parentnot in the same linear layout it compared them. And this is my problem. I need to compare only last two clicked, in this case Aquila and Vodolija. That will result as the wrong answer, cause they are not the pair, but thats irelevant now. So, when I click on the first button in the right layout Vodlija in this case I need to compare it with the last one clicked in the left layout, not the first one, and that Aquila in this case. How to do thatp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqlRns.jpg altenter image description herep

Negative 4645 pI have a feedback form where codeUsercodes can leave codeSuggestionscode. One type of codeSuggestioncode is a codeTagcode definition. This is the only type of codeSuggestioncode that has a target of sorts. It would in theory point to one tag. Other suggestions are just simply text and dont refer to any specific object.p  pIs it better practice to have a separate model for codeTagcode definition submissions, or is it better practice to combine the models together, and when a codeTagcode definition submitted, I would just fill in a codetagidcode.

Negative 4645 pIn a project Im working on, I have a textbox where the user has to input his name. To avoid the user from entering numbers I used the    a hrefhttpbrianjaeger.comdocslimitkeypressjquery.limitkeypress.jsjquery.limitkeypress.jsa library written by a hrefhttpbrianjaeger.comBrian Jaegera and every thing was working perfectly until I tested the website in Internet Explorer 10. In IE10, you can input all the letters you want, and you can not input number or weird symbols just as I wanted but when I type a space and then a letter, I see the letter print right to the space and then the space disappearing and the latter shifting to the left. The weird thing is that if I wait like 30 seconds after typing the space to type the letter it works fine.p

Negative 4645 pIve read a lot of documentation about adding custom validation attributes to a property of a model. Since I have a database first EF generated model, I would implement a partial class using metadata so that the code wontt get wiped in a model update. Just like in this sample  a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvRdcfw1btK0 relnofollowhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvRdcfw1btK0ap  pMy question is  what if the field that I want to validate already have annotation in the generated class  Like [StringLength75] and [DataMember]. Is my partial definition act as an override and apply the base annotation or is it just a plain shadow that will totally hide the one generated by EF p

Negative 4645 pIm using a regex to parse a CSVlike file. Im new to regular expressions, and, while it works, it gets slow when there are many fields AND one of the fields contains a very long value. How can I optimize itp  pThe CSV I have to parse is of the following flavorp  ol liAll fields are strings enclosed in quotes separated by commasli liQuotes inside fields are escaped in the form of two consecutive quotesli liThere is unpredictable garbage at the start of some lines which needs to be ignored so far it didnt contain quotes, thankfullyli liZerolength fields and newlines in fields are possibleli ol  pI am working with VB.NET. I am using the following regexp  precode.ltEntrygt,.lt.,ltLastEntrygt.lt. codepre  pI handle newlines by feeding StreamReader.ReadLines into a string variable until the regex succeeds, replacing the newline with a space this is OK for my purposes. I then extract the field contents by using Match.GroupsEntry.Captures and Match.GroupsLastEntry.p  pI suppose the performance hit is coming from the lookbehind for escaped quotes. Is there a better wayp  pThanks for any ideasp

That much is easy  NSArray sorted by descriptor.p  pHowever, I will need to be able to access the array and select multiple entries by time range where the startend times may not correspond exactly to any entry.  And this is modestly performance sensitive, both for setup time and for access time.p  pBest I can come up with is to sort the array and do a binary search for startend points.

Negative 4645 pI have two models, A and B.  A has many B.  Originally, both A and B had an autoincrementing primary key field called id, and B had an aid field. Now I have found myself needing a unique sequence of numbers for each B within an A. I was keeping track of this within my application, but then I thought it might make more sense to let the database take care of it. I thought I could give B a compound key where the first component is aid and the second component autoincrements, taking into consideration the aid. So if I insert two records with aid 1 and one with aid 2 then I will have something likep  precodeaid  otherid    1         1    1         2    2         1 codepre  pIf ids with lower numbers are deleted, then the sequence should not recycle these numbers.

Negative 4645 pTLDR strongIs there an effective way to push from now on, only to a git repository mirroring another, without losing the history on other mirrors of the same projectstrongp  pI have a project of a certain scale that is to say, fat that is being pushed to three different repositories one internal to a group sponsoring the project, one being Sourceforge, and one being GitHub.p  pUnfortunately, before this project went public to GitHub, some large AI knowledgebase type data files were added to the repository as CSV files several over GitHubs size limit soft limit 50MiB, hard limit 100MiBp  pOnce we realised the size issues, Ive removed the files and pushed BZ2 files that the Makefile will once I get around to doing it right expand back out during the build process, when the files are compiled into the systems state.p  pNow, the internal repository and the Sourceforge are in sync, but even though the files are absent in the HEAD, I cannot push to GitHub.p  pShort of wiping out the .git control files argh, and there are submodules What a pain to set up properly again and starting over, is there a way to so something likep  precode  git push origin BRANCH   git push sourceforge BRANCH   git push github fromxyzzytoHEADBRANCH codepre  pMy best guess was to usep  precode  git push github 320ce5..HEADBRANCH codepre  pbut I get       error src refspec 320ce5..HEAD does not match any.       error failed to push some refs to p  pNote 320ce5 is the latest commit, the one with the offending CSV files removed. So its presumable  HEAD.

How can this work with Simplenote If Simplenote sends the whole body every time, it wouldnt be that fastp  pIm also afraid that updating the whole list would mean the whole list would be downloaded on the other client and thats just a waste since the data I want to keep will be pretty static.p  pAnd I cant divide into multiple objects because I need to share the list with other users.p  pIm thinking Ill probably make the entries as values in the simperium object itself, so I can make small updates but that seems kind of a hackish way to do it and Id rather have an ordered listp  pThoughts Thanksp

Negative 4645 pIm trying to get navigation between views that support landscape emorem portrait orientations  working using a navigation controller and pushViewController and IOS6 code and have a problem where after pushing a landscape view controller onto the navigation controller stack, the view controller view correctly is in landscape but the device is still in portrait orientation. imagine an arrow pointing left to right on a landscape screen, here it points from down to up on a portrait screen so the dimensions are correct  its just the device should be in landscape mode so the arrow points left to right  if that makes sensep  pI have a portraitViewController and landscapeViewController that my different sub modes use.p  pUsing the iOS 6 method, The two classes overloadp  precodeBOOLshouldAutorotate UIInterfaceOrientationpreferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation NSUInteger supportedInterfaceOrientations codepre  pappropriately.p  pI also have my own derived navigationcontroller that overrridesp  precodeBOOLshouldAutorotate UIInterfaceOrientationpreferredInterfaceOrientationForPresentation NSUInteger supportedInterfaceOrientations codepre  pwith the functions returning the same functions of the top view controller so were not bound to portrait mode by the top level view controller.p  pMy first problem is that the device doesnt do an orientation refresh when you use pushViewController onto the navigation controller. This is well documented and has been solved up to now by using dismissViewController and presentViewController which forces a device orientation refresh which in turn queries the new view controller about what orientations it supports and switches the device appropriately.p  pThis works but loses transitioning between view controllers i.e with the new view sliding in from the right of the screen as the previous view is removed from screen before the next is added and the newly presented view is applied to the entire screen directly.p  pBecause of this, Ive been trying to get things working using pushViewController rather than present  dismissViewController. pushViewController works fine when I navigate from portrait to portrait view  the new view slides in nicely  its when I switch from a portrait to landscape view controller than things break.p  pJust pushViewController doesnt cause the device to refresh its orientation and query what the new view would like to use. Ive added calls to present  dismissModalViewController before my call to pushViewcontroller to force an orientation check with the new view controller. p  pstrong the problem strongp  pThis doesnt work however because the view is now in landscape mode but the device is still in portrait mode so the view is at 90 degs to what it should be.p  pIve tried fixing this by setting the status bar orientation to match the view controller landscape orientation but this causes massive problems when the user manually rotates the device from then on as they arent in sync. Also in iOS 6, you cant do that if your view controller returns YES from shouldAutoRotate function calls to setStausBarOrientation are ignored if you control orientation yourself in your view controller so it took a large hack to do it and it just doesnt feel like the right solution. p  pTo summarise, how can I use a navigation controller amp pushViewController using iOS6 and switch between landscape and portrait views properly At the moment, I cant get the device to update along with the view so the interface is in landscape but the device is still in portrait. If I try using setStatusBarOrientation to force the device to landscape, things start to go wrong as soon as I manually rotate the screen and it requires such a hack it just cant be the right answer.p  pthanksp  pp

Negative 4645 pIntellij IDEA automatically chain packages together if the intermediate ones are otherwise empty. It is a nice feature in general. However, sometimes you dont want them to be chained, especially when you are in the middle of creating new package structures for your new project. I might have come across the setting for disabling this feature for a certain package, but I cant find it where now. So, does anyone know how to control this feature Thank you very much.p  pBTW, in case you need clarification, what I mean by package chaining is as follows. Suppose you have this package structurep  precode tree com com  company      project          some              feature codepre  pSince there are really nothing else inside the intermediate folders, Intellij IDEA will automatically display it likep  precodecom.company.project.some.feature codepre  pin the project explorer, which looks like the packages are chained together.p

Negative 4645 pGreetings fellow programmersp  pI am developing a WindowsStoreApp for Windows 8.1 in which i work with contact information. The user can take a picture of a business card and gets the data from it.p  pWhat I now want to do is adding this contact to an MS Exchange account. I know, in the People App which is preinstalled on the system, i can connect with some online account, like the Exchange account, and add contacts to it. You click this add button, type in the information you need, choose an account to add it to and submit.p  pBecause I dont want to use the Exchange Web Services to access the account diretcly, i wanted to use this app as some kind of gateway to do that.p  pI have seen some posts which suggest to use ContactPicker and ContactPickerUI. I see that ContactPickerUI has a method to add a contact. But I cannot find out where it gets added to. There is this a hrefhttpcode.msdn.microsoft.comwindowsappsContactPickerAppsamplefc6677a1 relnofollowsample appa on msdn, which uses both classes and the AddContact Method, but all it does is showing on screen which contact you chose.p  pCan I maybe use the Share Charm to achieve this Can someone tell me where the ContactPickerUI adds the contact top  pThanks in advance.p  pPS This is the first time i ask a question myself. If there is anything wrong with it, let me know.p

Negative 4645 pI have a WPF listview and the ScrollViewer shows if large list. The ListView contains items with a checkbox element. We provide the ability to the users to select all and unselect all.p  pThe issue I experienced is only with larger list, meaning we see a subset of the elements and the user needs to use the Scroll Bar to view the rest of the elements. My code for selecting all elements and deselecting all elements is using the VisualTreeHelper helper class to set the property IsChecked of the checkbox to true or false. However it only works for the elements that are visible.  For example if I had a collection with 14 checkboxes where 10 checkboxes are visible on the screen, it only selects the 10 that are visible.  However, prior to clicking Select All, if you scroll up and down and view the items, then it selects all 14...so it appears that the VisualTree only loads the elements needed. Is there a way to force it to load all elements  p  pI was able to get it to work by disabling the ScrollViewer on the ListView and surrounding it with a ScrollViewer.

Negative 4645 pI came across a usercontributed note upvoted 7 times on the PHP manual page for a hrefhttpphp.netfunction.htmlspecialchars.php relnofollowhtmlspecialcharsa that has me confused.p  blockquote   pBe careful, the charset argument IS case sensitive. This is counterintuitive and serves no practical purpose because the HTML spec actually has the opposite.p blockquote  pNow, I do realize that there is no difference between ISO88591, ISO885915, UTF8, cp866, cp1251, cp1252, and KOI8R for the purposes of codehtmlspecialcharscode.p  pBut it had me wondering about codehtmlentitiescode and codehtmlentitydecodecode since they have the same parameters. Im on PHP 5.3 where the default is ISO88591. I did some testing with Windows1252, windows1252, UTF8, and utf8. In all cases, I got the expected results for characters that only exist in the tested character set.p  pSo then I wondered whether or not the note p  ul liapplies only to certain versionsli liapplies only to htmlspecialcharsli liis wrongli ul  pI tried digging into the source, but couldnt find my way around. Im mainly concerned with the behavior of codehtmlentitydecodecode across different versions because I use this to convert usersupplied HTML to plain text.p
Negative 4645 pAll,p  pI hope most of you know that with ios7 there is not need to do a null check for tableview reusep  precodeif cell  nil  codepre  pBut unfortunately, because of that the cells are always reinitialized, as we put the code in the same method for initializing values. The problem is only with text fields inside the tableview though.p  pLet me explain the scenario. I have a table view with multiple rows, and some rows contain multiple text boxes. I populate the textboxes with data from server when the page is loaded. Since the cells are always reinitialized as i explained above, whatever I enter in the field goes away and the server data is re populated once i scroll down and come back to the initial stage. This is because the populating the data code is also in the same place. After fetching a reusable cell it populates the data.p  pPreviously till ios6, we used ifcellnil and hence we loaded server data inside the cell and when reusing the cell, this piece of code will never be called.p  pI have other dirty solutions, but would like to know if someone else has a graceful way of dealing this. Please help. p

Negative 4645 pIm trying to build a Pyramid app that uses ZeroMQ to provide a very simple chatmessaging interface, but I cant seem to figure out the proper setupworkflow.p  pThe structure seems straightforward enough to me, and in its simplest form could be described in as little as two Pyramid viewsroutesp  ol listrongThe client SSE show messages viewstrong This viewroute would remain open to the client using ServerSent Events on the clientside and Pyramids coderesponse.appitercode on the serverside, listening for messages from ZeroMQ and codeyieldcodeing them up to the client as they are received.li listrongThe submit a new message viewstrong This viewroute would receive POST requests containing a single messages data, which it would then pass to ZeroMQ to be received in the SSE view and displayed to any clients listening there.li ol  pFor some reason however, I have not been able to come up with the correct recipe for accomplishing this feat. Google seems to be pretty sparse when it comes to recipes for 0MQ and Pyramid, and all of my own hacking has either resulted in PythonPyramid threadprocess problems, or 0MQ never being able to send or receive any messages which is probably related to my threading issues.p  pSo, how does one properly build this kind of an app with Pyramidp  pP.S. You may assume any version of PythonPyramid, etc in your answers. The point is to just get something that works as described.  p

Defining codeIsUserDefinedFunctioncode to always return codefalsecode had no impact, so Im positive the issue is in the parser.  Is there anyway to speed up the parsing of these keywordsp  pA major issue with the language being parsed is that it doesnt use a lot of whitespace between tokens, so a user defined function might begin with a language defined keyword.p  pFor example Given the language defined keyword codeGOTOcode and a userdefined function codeGOTO20Somethingcode, a typical piece of program text could look likep  precodeGOTO20 GOTO30 GOTO20Something GOTO20GOTO20Something codepre  pand should be tokenized as codeGOTO NUMBER GOTO NUMBER USERFUNCTION GOTO NUMBER USERFUNCTIONcodep  pstrongEdit to clarifystrongp  pEven rewriting codeIsUserDefinedFunctioncode asp  precodebool IsUserDefinedFunction  return false  codepre  pI still get the same slow performance.p  pAlso, to clarify, my performance baseline is compared with hardcoding the dynamic keywords into the Lexer like sop  precode Lexer.g4  Poor Performance 2000 line input,  2 seconds USERFUNCTION  [azAZ09] IsUserDefinedFunction   Lexer.g4  Good Performance 2000 line input,  20 milliseconds USERFUNCTION        ActualUserKeyword        AnotherActualUserKeyword        MoreKeywords     ...      codepre  pUsing the semantic predicate provides the correct behavior, but is terribly slow since it has to be checked for every alphanumeric character. Is there another way to handle tokens added at runtimep

Negative 4645 pIve been working on this piece of code to control a large array of servos on Arduino using Python. The code works, but Ive seen some strange behavior surrounding timing. Between each update to the servos, I need a sleep command. If I dont insert a sleep, the program will work the first time I run it, but if the Python code gets stopped, then I try to connect over serial with Python again, the Arduino is non responsive. What could be happening to the serial port and how could I prevent this from happeningp  pAlso, am I parsing the data coming into the Arduino the most efficient way possible using memcpy Or is there a better or more standard way to do thisp  pIve read about using serialEvent, is there a benefit to using that command for parsing serial data in this situationp  precodeARDUINO CODE include ltServo.hgt

Negative 4645 pIm working on an multithreaded server application for learning puposes. My problem right now is receiving the data.The first time I wrote the application I used WSAAsyncSelect, but I didnt like how it was working  the window dependency was stupid in my opinion, even if you hid the window.. So I rewrote it and now I have a thread that goes through the connected clients and checks if there is any data to be be received and pass it to the worker threads. This works for a small ammount of clients, but I think that for a larger amount it might delay other clients too much. A solution Ive read about is having a thread for each client, but there are thread limitations.

The way to get 6,7 is as follows. Since in column C 0.3 0.1 where 0.1 is defined by usconditional format , we take all values from column B. Each value in column B is subtracted from column Awe take the absolute value after the subtraction . For example for 0.3 , the corresponding value in column A is 2. We subtract this from each and every value in column B. 28,29,215,216,217,218 and so on. From these values we choose only those values less than 8defined by us again. So the only 2 values are 6,7 since the absolute value of everything else is greater than 8. We print this value in column D.p

Negative 4645 pI am currently building a DDD application that validates loans.  Each loan has various validation checks that must be performed before a loan is approved.  The validation checks vary a fair amount from loan to loan and most require external infrastructure services to complete.p  pSo given that, we decided the best way to implement these checks would be to create a config file for each loan type, which would list the specific rules and the respective validator service that could perform the rule check.  In addition, some rules require specific parameters to be passed along.  Such as for a credit score check, there would be a threshold value must be over 600 for example.  For that we think we should just pass a dictionary object of strings, called validation criteria.  Unless someone has a more elegant way to do thisp  pRight now my Loan entity has a validate method which accepts a list of rules to check against.  My question is, whats the best way to resolve the service references from the config file at runtime  Pass a service factory to the Validate method, which accepts a string validator name p  pI am using Unity for DI in the rest of the app, but cant figure out the best way to do this dynamically at runtime.p  pAny insight would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 4645 pis it possible in JSF facelets to do a conditional codeuiincludecode and preserve the layout of the parent the including xhtmlp  pExample I have a form which has always some basic attributes rendered in a panelgrid with 4 columns label, input, label input. Now I have some type specific form input elements. For each type specific form part I created a separate xhtml. For this the specific attributes have to be conditionally included after the basic attributes. Unfortunately the codeuiincludecode has no coderenderedcode attribute. So I have to wrap something around the codeuiincludecode. This unfortunately overrides my layout set by the including parent which defines 4 columns. I want to render the specific attributes in this 4 column panelGrid without starting a new layout element which is vanishing my layout. Is there a possibility in JSF to achieve thisp  pRegards Oliverp

Negative 4645 pThe weirdest thing in the world is happening to me, and I wanted to ask if anyone has heard of anything similiar to this, and any possible solution. My designer created a website, on his own computer. I implemented his css  html in my code, and I noticed everything was coming out a bit bigger on my website eg menu was wider, top bar was larger, etc After playing around with this for over 3 hours, I decided to just Save the website the designer made to my Desktop. I did this, opened it in chrome, and it was exactly like I saw on the designers site. I then proceeded to copy past the website I saved into xampp and lo and behold, everything was bigger, JUST like in MY website. I have quite literally no idea what is going on, the exact same files on my Desktop are showing up differently when I copy them into xampp.p  pAny idea whats going on Thanksp  pEDIT To make matters weirder, it appears the enlarging only happens in chrome...p

Negative 4645 pIm currently learning as3 but I come from several years of as2 experience, so what I was used to do is attach movieclips using string with a numeric variable to get the right identifier like this and maybe I was thinking about using eval here but of course its not available in as3 so here is what I was doing in as2p  precodecurrentlevel1 myString  levelMccurrentlevel codepre  pAnd then of course use the constructed string in attachMovie function to get the right clip attached.p  precodeattachMoviemyString,myStringmydepth,mydepth codepre  pBut I see in as3 all is about classes and all different so I cant seem to find a way to dynamically get the right class name for the child to be added, is there an actual way to make that possible because as far as I have gone I see that I should get the class name to make new object and then put that in addChild so therefore I cant find a way to pass any kind of dynamically constructed string or element refering my needed clip there, is it still possible. Thanks beforehand for any clues p  pEDIT I added the attachmovie call as a clarifying line, I know all you got what I was asking but as I cant find a right approach I prefer to clarify. Additionally I shouldnt have mentioned the eval here, sorry, I just can ask my as2 with string usagep  pEDIT Solved, thanks to you all guys, you saved me, I wish I could give you all kudos because all of your ideas and tips are awesome and really helpful, I marked that answer as correct because it was the one that lead me to getDefinitionByName which is what Im going to use in the end, but as said all tips and ideas to face new as3 world will help me greatly, so as said I wish I could give reputation to you all, thanks a lot p

Negative 4645 pI made a ClojurescriptCompojure webapp, deployed in a war to Tomcat 7.

Negative 4645 pI have been rewriting this code a few times now, but the same problem with the lighting appears... I am comparing this code with the code I wrote a few months ago that does the same thing lighting a cube and it doesnt seem like I am missing anything.p  pFront and back side of the cube are okay, but the left and right sides are acting strangely, and also the top and the bottom... looks like there is a problem with the normals, but they are okay... checked them and rewrote them a few times just to be sure.p  pExample a hrefhttpgamedevelopment.t15.orgWebGLWebGL20ExamplesExample2072020Ambient20And20Directional20Light

Negative 4645 pIm working on a large product consisting of a three windows services and several normal windows applications .exe.  Now we want to move to ETW and Semantic Logging, and use the Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.p  pI read somewhere that all logically connected parts of the application should use the same event source. This means that preferrably we would like to have pretty much a single EventSource for our services. But how can we do this without introducing dependencies among pretty much all the assemblies in the productp  pThe application currently consists of about 70 assemblies. And to be able to create a logmethod in the EventSource that for example accepts an enumvalue, the assembly containing the event source has to reference the assembly defining the enum, which means that the enum definition would need to be moved from the assembly using it, an .exe perhaps, to something that is referenced by all assemblies.p  pIs there some way to have several classes derived from EventSource in one application that still use the same ETW EventSource Or what would be a good way to implement semantic logging with ETW in a scenario such as this, when it is undesirable to introduce a whole bunch of new dependencies to create your log classp

The next link works.p  pWhat I was thinking was that when user clicks the div, the ajax sends the GET and uses success respons to keep populating the gallery.p  pAny help on this is greatly appreciated and very needed haha. Or if there is some better way of doing this Im open to suggestions... The idea here is to eventually add a window scroll to check the bottom offset, and THEN execute the load more until there isnt a next URL in the respons.p  pEDITSIDENOTE Is this the best way, from a security stand point, to do this Considering that by using this technique, I have to pass the access token in the value in the URL.

Negative 4645 pI am writing an app that allows the user to choose the format in which the picture will be taken.p  pMy problem is when I query the camera for its capabilities I get codeintegerscode representing the formats it can capture in, these codeintegerscode are defined as constants in ImageFormat and ImagePixel class.p  pObviously I cant present the user with these choices as codeintegerscode so I need to create a data structure probably a map to convert these codeintegerscode to codestringscode representing the formats so I can present these to the user and translate back to codeintegercode to send the choice to the camera.p  pI dont really like this option because it is not very future resistant because if Google will decide to add a new constant or a new format cameras can capture in will be invented I have to change my code again.p  pThis problem seems to me like something someone would have ran into already possibly Google when dealing with the camera so my question is thisp  pIs there a built inAPI for these conversions and if not, does anyone have a better and more future resistant idea than a map p  pThank you very much.p

Negative 4645 pRecently I have been tasked with doing a few speed checks so I can tell whether is faster to use phpphpcli or c to insert a certain number of rows into a database.p  pBefore we start, let me tell you a few details so everything is clearp  ul liThe php part is run through Apache, directly requested in the browser.li liThe hard disk drive tests are being run on is an SSD drive. I guess things would be slower in regular drives. The machine itself is nothing special, six years old or so.li liAll inserts are being done via prepared statements. Were using mysqli on php and the mysqlcppconn mysql c connector, provided by Oracle.li liAll inserts are done entry by entry. I know we can stack them but well, were testing here.li liTimes are displayed via microtime in php and via  header in c.li liThe code itself is not equivalent, of course. More on that later.li liAll text is in UTF8. Theres russian, chinese, arabic, spanish, english and all kinds of crazy stuff in there. The mysql table is in utf84mb.li liThe numbers for the c code are the results of using an stdvector and O2 levels compiling with g vectors outperformed maps, unorderedmaps and stdarrays.li ul  pSo, this is the processp  ul liConnect to the database.li liOpen a text file with N lines.li liRead a line of the file.li liSplit the line on a separator character.li liUse certain parts of the split line to get insert values say, the 0th, 1st and 3rd indexes.li liSend these parts to the prepared statement to insert them.li liRepeat until the file is completely read.li ul  pBoth codes work exactly as expected. Here are the resulting numbersp  pphp p  ul li5000 entries 1.42  1.27 sec.li li20000 entries 5.53  6.18 sec.li li50000 entries 14.43  15.69 sec.li ul  pcp  ul li5000 entries 1.78  1.81 sec.li li20000 entries 7.19  7.22 sec.li li50000 entries 18.52  18.84 sec.li ul  pphp outperforms c as the lines in the file increase... At first, I suspected of the line splitting function the splitting in php is done with explode. The algorithm is as naive as it comes for c... The container is passed via reference and its contents are changed on the fly. The container is traversed only once. I made sure the container reserves all neccesary space remember, I finally choose vectors that is fixed. The container is created on the main function and then is passed by reference through the code. It is never emptied or resized only its contents change.p  precodetemplatelttypename containergt void explodeconst stdstringamp pstring, const char pdelimiter, containeramp presult      auto itpresult.begin     stdstringconstiterator begpstring.begin, endpstring.end     stdstring temp      whilebeg lt end              if begpdelimiter                      ittemp             it             temp                  else                      tempbeg                   beg           ittemp  codepre  pAs said before, the task performed is equivalent, but the code generating it is not. C code has the usual trycatch blocks for controlling the mysql interactions. As for the rest, the main loop runs until EOF is reached and every iteration checks if the insertion failed both in c and php.p  pI have seen c greatly outperforming php in working with files and their contents so I expected the same to be applicable here. Somehow I suspect of the splitting algorithm but maybe it is just that the database connector is slower still, when I disabled database interaction php still processed faster or my code is sub par... p  pAs far as profiling goes, gprof spat this out about the c codep  precodeEach sample counts as 0.01 seconds.      cumulative   self              self     total             time   seconds   seconds    calls  nscall  nscall  name      60.00      0.03     0.03    50000   600.00   600.00  void ancstrexplotarcadenaltstdvectorltstdstring, stdallocatorltstdstringgt gt gtstdstring constamp, char, stdvectorltstdstring, stdallocatorltstdstringgt gtamp  40.00      0.05     0.02                             insertarsqlPreparedStatement, stdstring constamp, stdvectorltstdstring, stdallocatorltstdstringgt gtamp   0.00      0.05     0.00        1     0.00     0.00  GLOBALsubIZN7ancstr21obtenerlineaarchivoERSt14basicifstreamIcSt11chartraitsIcEE codepre  pWhere explotarcadena is explode and insertar is split this line and set the prepared statement up.

Negative 4645 pIm creating a 10x10 grid GridView of views CellView.p  pI am able to create this for a single sized screen but have thus far been unable to create a solution that will work for all of the 3 current screen dimensions on iPhones. p  pThe gridView is created in autolayout and has a few constraints equal ration between width and height, and is 8px away from the horizontal edges. p  pI have had two approaches p  p1. When calling init to create the CellView I base its frame on the size of the superview.p  pcode let cellSize  gridView.bounds.width15 let cellRect  CGRectorigin CGPointx x, y y, size CGSizewidth cellSize, height cellSize codep  pThis approach has not seemed to work and the cells do not all fit into grid. They are either too large or too small depending on the variation in the divisor. p  p2. My second approach was to use auto layout for the cells. p  pAfter creating the cellView and adding it as a subview to the gridView I add 2 constraints. p  pcode     var width  NSLayoutConstraintitem self,         attribute NSLayoutAttribute.Width,         relatedBy NSLayoutRelation.Equal,         toItem self.superview,         attribute NSLayoutAttribute.Width,         multiplier 0.0666667,  115         constant 0 code code     var height  NSLayoutConstraintitem self,         attribute NSLayoutAttribute.Height,         relatedBy NSLayoutRelation.Equal,         toItem self.superview,         attribute NSLayoutAttribute.Height,         multiplier 0.0666667,  115         constant 0 codep  pUnfortunately, this results in the cellViews not appearing on screen. After inspecting this is due to a widthheight of 0 yet they also have additional width and height 0 below the 0 values in the constraints during runtime. p  pIm unsure which approach is best. I am creating the cellViews programmatically, and need an approach that will work on all device screen sizes. p  pWould much appreciate a better solution or ideas with errors in my current approaches. p

The only idea Ive had is changing the following.p  precodefor int cx  x, cy  y, ty cx  2 cx  prv[cx], cy  ty                  yx[cy]  cx               xy[cx]  cy        codepre  pTo the followingp  precodefor int cx  x, cy  y, ty cx  2 cx  prv[cx], cy  ty                  yx[cy]  cx yx[cx]cy             xy[cx]  cy xy[cy]cx      codepre  pSo that the algorithm always checks paths where the pairings are mutual. However, Im rather sure this is wrong  the code usually segfaults. p  pI tried fixing the problem by changing codeif maxmatch  ncode to a looser constraint, like codeif maxmatch gt n1code, so that the algorithm is content with a subperfect matching. This works sometimes, and when it does, it creates some mutual pairs like I wanted, but some vertices are left unpaired. And there are still segmentation faults.p  pSo, is there any way to fix this problem Are there other more suitable algorithms for thisp

Negative 4645 pIm trying to focus in a more advanced use of Javascript in my application. Because of that I have studied a lot what would be the best way to use oop in js.I have seen Douglas Crockford way a hrefhttpwww.crockford.comjavascriptinheritance.html relnofollowhttpwww.crockford.comjavascriptinheritance.htmla. I have seen John Resig way a hrefhttpejohn.orgblogsimplejavascriptinheritance relnofollowhttpejohn.orgblogsimplejavascriptinheritancea. Ive read the excelent book The Principles of ObjectOriented JavaScript by Nicholas Zakas, Ive read some sites on JS patterns, and frankly I didt like what I saw. Some methods seem too verbose, some are really confusing, some seem too odd, but specially seems like everybody is going in oposite ways in js. I have experience in several other OO languages and use oop for many years. I came from C, Java, PHP, Delphi. But the Js oopinheritance models seems really messy to me. Maybe its just my inexperience in it. Anyway I have to find a model that I think is good enough to start. So thinking and experimenting with several models I more or less decided myself  on this onep  precodefunction A      var x  15 private members     var y  20     this.soma  function    public member         return x  y           this.getX  function  return x      this.getY  function  return y     function B          this.mult  function   public member             return getX  getY   inherited public members           B.prototype  A  b  new B  console.logb.mult codepre  pSo I would like to hear from  more experienced js developers if doing oopinheritance this way is correct and what would be a better way of doing it. p

Negative 4645 pIm a strongPHP programmerstrong by profession. So, I dont have any idea about iOS and Android coding.p  pThe scenario is there is one website developed using a Social Networking PHP software titled strongPHPFoxstrong.p  pNow there are two similar mobile apps which exactly replicates the functionality of this website. One mobile app is in iOS and another is in Android.p  pSo, Ive written a set of RESTful APIs where Im accepting the request from mobile app, parse the request, pass the request parameters to the function which does the same job for website, get the response from this function, convert it into JSON format and sent it back to mobile app. For iOS and Android app Im using the same set of REST API files.p  pWhen user logs in the REST API for login gets called. Eventually the PHPFox function for authentication gets called, a security token is generated along with some other user data. With every login the different security token is generated by PHPFox. This data is set into the Session. Now every time I call any of the functions through any REST API file the security token generated at the time of login is verified and only upon successful verification of token the PHPFox function gets called. This verification process is done internally by PHPFox. SO no need to pass the security token explicitly or implicitly to any REST API call.p  pTill now everything works absolutely fine.p  pMy doubt starts from here. I dont know whether the session is maintained in iOSAndroid app. So, if session on server i.e. PHPFox gets timed out then what will happen to the app Will it get crash Will the user need to do login again If user kills the app on the device and again comes to the app do heshe needs to do the login process again p  pToo many doubts are there in my mind. I got totally confused with these things. p  pCan someone please put more focus on the issue Im facing It would be really great if you could explain in detail. p  pThanks.p

Negative 4645 pI am currently working on creating my first Android app. Here is how it is supposed to work p  pThe app uses the Google API to create a map fragment on the main screen, along with several location markers. When someone clicks on one of the markers, it creates a small, interactive popup bubble with several relevant statistics about that location, along with a switch and a button. If the user presses the switch, the statistics will be replaced with a short description of that location. If the user presses the button, it will bring them to a different activity via intent. p  pMy initial instinct is that since the popup bubble has interactive elements button and switch, it must be created as a fragment IE it cant simply be a viewgroup. p  pIve done some research and Ive found that there are methods to pin views and viewgroups to the map via  MapView.addView, but I have not found anything about pinning entire fragments. p  pIve thought of some other possible ways to accomplish my goal, but Im not sure if these are possible p  ol lipCreate the popup bubble as its own activity, instead of a fragment. Treat a markerclick as an intent, creating the new bubble activity on top of the map pausing the map. This seems labor intensive to the system, and I would still need to figure out how to convert the marker coordinates to screen coordinates so the bubble is created in place. pli lipCreate the entire map fragment on top of a relative layout, and then when a user clicks a marker, create the popup bubble atop the layout, and above the map fragment. Not sure if I can create a fullscreen map fragment on top of a layout, and also would once again face the issue of converting coordinates. pli lipApparently, it is possible albeit tricky to embed a fragment within a view or so I have been lead to believe by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8246185androidpossibletoaddafragmenttoaviewflipperthis OS questiona. If I could do that, then perhaps I could pin a view to the map using MapView.addView with the popup bubble fragment embedded inside. But that seems tricky, and Im not sure if I even understand the limitations of that technique IE the view may need to be of a very specific type and appearance. pli ol  pDoes anyone have any ideas on the best way to accomplish my goal p  pAny advice would be much appreciated p

Negative 4645 pWe have a table TRANSMISSIONSID, NAME which behaves funny in the following waysp  ul liThe statement to add a foreign key in another table referencing TRANSMISSIONS.ID wont finishli liThe statement to add a column to TRANSMISSIONS wont finishli liThe statement to disabledrop a unique constraint wont finishli liThe statement to disabledrop a trigger wont finishli ul  pTRANSMISSIONs primary key is ID, there is also a unique constraint on NAME  therefore there are indexes on ID and NAME. We also have a trigger which creates values for column ID using a sequence, so that INSERT statements do not need to provide a value for ID.p  pBesides TRANSMISSIONS, there are two more tables behaving like this. For other tables, the abovementioned statements work fine.p  pThe database is used in an application with Hibernate and due to an incorrect JPA configuration we produced high values for ID during a time. Note that we use the trigger only for manual INSERT statements and that Hibernate produces ID values itself, also using the sequence.p  pThe first thought was that the problems were due to the high IDs but we have the problems also with tables that never had such high IDs.p  pAnyways we suspected that the indexes might be fragmented somehow and called ALTER INDEX TRANSMISSIONSPK SHRINK SPACE COMPACT, which ran through but showed no effect.p  pAlso, we wanted to call ALTER TABLE TRANSMISSIONS SHRINK SPACE COMPACT which didnt work because we needed to call first ALTER TABLE TRANSMISSIONS ENABLE ROW MOVEMENT which never finished.p  pWe have another instance of the database which does not behave in such a funny way. So we think it might be that in the course of running the application the database got somehow into an inconsistent state.p  pDoes someone have any suggestions what might have gone out of controlinto an inconsitent statep  pMore hintsp  pThere are no locks present on any objects in the database according to information in vlock and vlockedobjectp  pWe tried all these statements in SQL Developer and also using SQLPlus commandline tool.p

So my idea is as follows i have one ubuntuserver currently ubuntudesktop version 12.x on a virtual machine, i will change it to a real server later.... and i want to run on the server ffmpeg, which should record the livestream and saves it locally ffserver, for broadcasting the same livestream, using the rtp protocoll because of the timestampheader in the protocoll. so if i understoot the documentation correctly, this is my idea   start ffserver from linuxterminal   codeffserver f Desktopffserver.confcode   start ffmpeg and connect to the feed of ffserver  codeffmpeg re i httpInternetStreamer.sdpplaylist.m3u8 vcodec libx264 s 320x240 pixfmt yuv420p vb 200000 minrate 200000 maxrate 200000 bufsize 2000000 acodec libmp3lame ab 128k ar 44100 f rtp an httplocalhost8090feed1.ffmcode  I am getting the Stream from the URL a hrefhttpInternetStreamer.sdpplaylist.m3u8 relnofollowhttpInternetStreamer.sdpplaylist.m3u8a and want  sent it to ffserveralso i want to save it locally for backup later...p  pnow when i start ffmpeg i get the following error  Could not write header for output file 0 incorrect codec parametersp  pLast thing to say is that is very important to broadcast the stream with RTPProtocoll.

Negative 4645 pI have an asp.net web page that allows for manual entry of a record, or an import from an excel spreadsheet to import multiple records.p  pAfter the records are added by either process, they display in a Gridview control bound to a SQLDataReader.  This allows the user to edit or delete a record before submitting the entire dataset for processing.p  pIm using an Ajax Toolkit AsyncFileUpload control to handle the import.  The UploadedComplete c function runs properly and the records are inserted into the SQL table.  The code then calls my DataBindGrid function to refresh the grid.  I can step through the code and see that every line is executing, however, it seems like it never actually finishes, even though stepping through debugging completes.p  pTwo steps are not actually completing, the grid refresh and the label display that indicates to the user that the process is complete.p  pFor testing purposes, Ive added a linkButton that calls the BindDataGrid when clicked.  This works to refresh the grid and to also display the status label.  Its not a permanent solution, it would be too risky to have a user remember to refresh, they are likely to think that all their records have already been submitted.p  pAt first I thought my problem was trying to do more inside the UploadComplete function then just upload the file Im reading the Excel file that was uploaded, so I broke out the code and added a button for the user to click to initiate the actual data processing.  This failed because although I could see the file name being saved into a hidden form during the UploadComplete function, when I went to read that hidden field, the data was no longer in it.  Im not loosing the values in any of the other hidden fields.p  pIve been researching this for 3 days and Im really stuck.  Im assuming that I am having a problem with postback, but have no clue at this point.p  pHere is my codep  precodelt Page Title LanguageC MasterPageFileWTIMS.Master AutoEventWireuptrue

Negative 4645 pI have a docker container and I would like to start a process in the host OS, and then have it execute in the context of the docker container. That is, my executable is a file in the host filesystem, and I want to start a process in the host OS, but I want to contain that process to the container, so that e.g. the process can only access the containers filesystem, etc.p  pFor various reasons I do not want to copy the executable into the container and execute it there. p  pI do realize that this is a somewhat strange thing to be trying to do with docker containersp
Negative 4645 pIm trying to use the approximate match function of vlookup to find a value in an array, that can be of different length. I just dragged the lookup array as far down as possible in order to assure that all data is selected, however, the approximate match option will then always select the last value in the array. Is there a way of feeding vlookup the correct lookup array in order to extract the correct value Regards p
Negative 4645 pI have a simple script for user login. I have the passwords encrypted as SHA1 in mySQL database table using charset utf8unicodeci.p  pWhen I run q in the database with values it returns result all right. But through the script even after entering correct credentials, I am not able to login. Also, it is working fine if I remove the encryption at both places script and database. Same problem occurs if I use MD5 instead. p  pI am not sure what I am missing at. I tried to echo the SHA1 output and it comes out to be different than the encrypted password visible in the database. I have checked for any extra spaces in my input as well. Please help me understand what is wrong. Let me know if you need anything else.

Negative 4645 pI am quite confused whether Hadoop supports configuring binding interface for containers . Since there are multiple NICs on my machine and the data networking not going through eth0. There are ways to set the binding port for HDFS and RMNM, but is there a way to bind container IPCs to my desired interface maybe eth1 I am looking forward to your help Thx I am using hadoop 2.6 by the way.p

Negative 4645 pI cant understand this, should be an easy question tho. I have a ViewController in a navigation controller. 2 views more or less. Top view is a tableview that takes up 95 of the view, and has topleadingtrailing. 2nd view is a fixed 44 height UIView at the bottom, with leadingtrailingbottom... and vertical spacing to tableView. On viewDidLoad, I print out the CGRects for the tableview, the fixed 44 height uiview, and the main view. I get this...p  precodetableViewRect 0, 64, 600, 492  fixedHeightViewRect 0, 556, 600, 44  self.view 0, 0, 375, 667 codepre  pHowever, I look at it on my device and the fixed 44 height view is CLEARLY at the very bottom of my phone. Something is wonky here. If the entire height of the display is 667, yet the fixedHeightView is starting at 556 and is 44 high, therefore its on screen vertically between 556 and 600... how am I able to see it at the very bottom of my screen, a screen which is 667 in height. I would expect fixedHeight would start at Y 623 going to 667. I would then in turn expect the height of my tableView to be 559. However, Im not getting this. Why is thatp

Negative 4645 pI am creating a side scrolling bar chart to represent a value that changes every second.

I need each to run as soon as they are called, this would mean that at some point all 5 animations will be running together, albeit spaced by a second. 1 second after codeimageView[5]code starts, codeimageView[0]code will follow. How can they all be running at the same timep  pAs far as I am aware, an codeAnimatorSetcode is not the correct answer since as far as I understand anyway, I have an indefinite number of codeimageViewcodes to animate, and animations cannot be added to the codeAnimatorSetcode emafterem it has started.p  pemSide note I have already had this working correctly using multiple codeThreadscode and codeTranslateAnimationscode but did not run smoothly on the UI. This is a different approach I am now taking to simplify my old code and hopefully get better performance.emp

Negative 4645 pI have asked this question over the last 2 years and am still looking for a good way of doing this. What I am doing is as follows p  pI have a WPFC application which has been developed over the last 3 years. It takes a real time stream of bytes over a UDP port. Each record set is 1000 bytes. I am getting 100 of these byte records per second. I am reading the data and processing it for display in various formats. These logical records are subcommutated. p  pThe first 300 bytes are the same each logical record contain a mixture of Byte, Int16, UInt16, Int32 and UInt32 values. About 70 of these values are eventually multiplied by an least significant bit to create a Double. These parameters are always the same. The second 300 bytes are another mixture of Byte, Int16, UIn32, Int32 and UInt32 values. Again about 70 of these values are multiplied by an LSB to create a Double. These parameters are again always the same.  The last segment is 400 bytes and subcommutated. This means that the last part of the record contains 1 of 20 different logical record formats. I call them Type01...Type20 data. There is an identifier byte which tells me which one it is. These again contain Byte, Int, UInt data values which need to be converted.p  pI am currently using hundreds of function calls to process this data. Each function call takes the 1000 byte array as a parameter, an offset index into the byte array to where the parameter starts. It then uses the BitConverter.ToXXX call to convert the bytes to the correct data type, and then if necessary multiply by an LSB to create the final data value and return it.p  pI am trying to streamline this processing because the data stream are changing based on the source. For instance one of the new data sources feeds changes about 20 parameters in the first 300 bytes, about 24 parameters in the second 300 bytes and several in the last subcommutated 400 bytes records.p  pI would like to build a data dictionary where the dictionary contains the logical record number type of data, offset into the record, LSB of data, type of data to be converted to Int16, UInt32, etc and finally output type Int32, Double, etc. Maybe also include the BitConverter function to use and cast it dynamicallyp  pThis appears to be a exercise in using Template Classes and possibly Delegates but I do not know how to do this. I would appreciate some code as in example. p  pThe data is also recorded so playback may run at 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x speeds. Now before someone comments on how you can look at thousands of parameters at those speeds, it is not as hard as one may think. Some types of data such as green background for good, red for bad or plotting map positions LATLON over time lend themselves very well for fast playback to find interesting events. So it is possible.p  pThanks in advance for any help.p  pI am not sure others have an idea of what I am trying to do so I thought I would post a small segment of source code to see if anyone can improve on it.p  pLike I said above, the data comes in byte streams. Once it is read in a Byte Array it looks like the followingp  precodeByte[] InputBuffer   0x01, 0x00, 0x4F, 0xEB, 0x06, 0x00, 0x17, 0x00,  0x00, 0x00, ...     codepre  pThe first 2 bytes are an ushort which equals 1. This is the record type for this particular record. This number can range from 1 to 20.p  pThe next 4 bytes are an uint which equals 453,455. This value is the number of tenths of a seconds. Value in this case is 123545.5. To arrive at this I would make the following call to the following subroutinep  precodelabelTimeDisplay.Content  TimeFieldInputBuffer, 2, .1.ToString  public Double TimeFieldByte[] InputBuffer, Int32 Offset, Double lsb     return BitConverter.ToUInt32InputBuffer, Offset  lsb  codepre  pThe next data field is the software version, in this case 23p  precodelabelSoftwareVersion.Content  SoftwareVersionInputBuffer, 6.ToString  public UInt16 SoftwareVersionByte[] InputBuffer, Int32 Offset     return BitConverter.ToUInt16InputBuffer, Offset  codepre  pThe next data field is the System Status Word another UInt16.p  pBuiltInTest status bits are passed to other routines if any of the 16 bits are set to logic 1.p  precodeUInt16 CheckStatus  SystemStatusInputBuffer, 8  public UInt16 SystemStatusByte[] InputBuffer, Int32 Offset     return BitConverter.ToUInt16InputBuffer, Offset  codepre  pI literally have over a thousand of individual subroutines to process the data stored in the array of bytes. The array of bytes are always fixed length of 1000 bytes. The first 6 bytes are always the same, identifier and time. After that the parameters are different for every frame.p  pI have some major modifications coming the software which will redefine many of the parameters for the next software version. I still have to support the old software versions so the software just gets more complicated. My goal is to find a way to process the data using a dictionary lookup. That way I can just create the dictionary and read the dictionary to know how to process the data. Maybe use loops to load the data into a collection and then bind it to the display fields.p  pSomething like thisp  precodepublic class ParameterDefinition      String ParameterNumber     String ParameterName     Int32 Offset     Double lsb     Type ReturnDataType     Type BaseDataType   private ParameterDefinition[] parms  new ParameterDefinition[]     new ParameterDefinition  0000,RecordID,  0, 0.0,  typeofUInt16, typeofUInt16,     new ParameterDefinition  0001,    Time,  2, 0.1,  typeofDouble, typeofUInt32,     new ParameterDefinition  0002,   SW ID,  6, 0.0,  typeofUInt16, typeofUInt16,    new ParameterDefinition  0003,  Status,  8, 0.0,  typeofUInt16, typeofUInt16,       Lots more parameters  codepre  pMy bottom line problem is getting the parameter definitions to cast or select the right functions. I cannot find a way to link the dictionary to actual data ouputsp  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 4645 pIve searched the web in earnest, but have not found a solution to my specific issue.  p  pI have written an opensource application menu app for LinuxUnixlike users using Gtk2.

Im currently developing this app on Debian 8.1 using Gtk 2 and C.

The problem is every time I use the refresh button, when I try to add a new lineentry, I get 2 or 4 additional entries with one click, whereas if one gets deleted, all the copies are deleted too they arent actual copies though because each of them has their own unique id.p  precodedef refreshself      self.session.closeall     self.session  CreateSessionself.username, self.password custom method defined elsewhere for creating a session      self.TableViews initializing the table views for pyside      self.WidgetsToAttributes connect widgets of the gui to the sqlalchemy scheme attributes      self.connectSignals connects the qt signals to the appropriate functions in code      pass codepre  pthere are also some additional initializations but they are irrelevant here because they only initialize some widgetsp  pAll the above functions are used in other places, for example for the first initialization of the GUI, so what doesnt work here is the combination of the methods.

How would I be able to make it work. p  pFor reference, body starts with  p  pBelow is my controller code p  precodeangular.moduleSqueeg.controllers, [] .controllerSqueegApp, functionscope, state, rootScope, stateParams     scope.back  function       state.gowelcome         scope.logout  function      Parse.User.logOut     rootScope.user  null     rootScope.isLoggedIn  false     state.gowelcome,          clear true           .controllerWelcomeController, functionscope, state, rootScope, stateParams    alerttest    .controllerHomeController, functionscope, state, rootScope   scope.home  Home      .controllerView2, functionscope, state, rootScope    scope.message  Test    codepre
Negative 4645 pIm unsure of how to describe this issue please let me know if this has been answered under a different titlep  pAs it stands, one can pass a parameter to the URL via a simple, hardcoded HTML codehrefcode if Im at codehttpwebsite.comcode and click on codelta hrefvar1gtcode, the new URL will be codehttpwebsite.comvar1code.p  pHowever, if Im at codehttpwebsite.comvar2code and click on that same link, itll replace codevar2code in the URL and we end up at codehttpwebsite.comvar1code rather than codehttpwebsite.comvar2ampvar1code.p  pWhat Id like to know is whether its possible to add a codevar2code parameter to the URL via codehrefcode without losing codevar1code.p  pThis is certainly feasible with JavaScript if I take codewindow.location.hrefcode, append either codevar2code or codeampvar2code depending on whether a parameter is already present, and plugging the dynamically generated URL back into the DOM e.g. codelta hrefhttpwebsite.comvar2ampvar1gtcode.p  pHowever, is this behaviour possible without JavaScript Whilst trivial to implement, it feels like something that HTML codehrefcode attributes should support natively i.e. the ability to add a parameter preceded dynamically by either codecode or codeampcode depending on the situation.p  pThanks for any pointersp
Negative 4645 pI have three divs that are all float left. Like so 123. Now, if the spans font within div1 is longer then the width I set, it goes to next line in the div. This is fine, but the next line is no longer at the left most margin of the div. It looks like the inside text of the div when longer then one line is set to center, not margin left. How can I go about handling this. The current css I have is herep  precode.leftdivresultslist  divfirstchild      width70            floatleft  .leftdivresultslist divnthchild2     floatleft     width10          .leftdivresultslist divnthchild2     width10     floatleft  .leftdivresultslist tr td     minwidth400px  codepre  phere is an examplep  precodegt  gt    this is correct gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  gt  this is not correct when the gt      length is longer.   gt This needs to also be left aligned. gt  gt  codepre
Negative 4645 pI am trying to include a modular thirdparty library a hrefhttpwellcaffeinated.netPhysicsJS relnofollowPhysicsJSa into my webpack project. This library is AMD and CommonJSfriendly, and has wellformed submodules that I want to access. However it is primarily structured for RequireJS, via its codepackagescode definition spec in coderequire.configcode, so the entry point isnt a standard codeindex.jscode. Instead the entry point is codephysicsjs.jscode. p  pIn other words, I cant seem to figure out how to configure webpack to resolve both the librarys main file and its submodules. It just seems like if the librarys entry point isnt codeindex.jscode and it has submodules, you are out of luck, and I just cant believe thats correct, so I must be missing something.p  pSo, how can the following statements be made to resolvep  precoderequirephysicsjs  entry point requirephysicsjsbodiesrectangle   submodule codepre  pI have tried variations of this configp  precoderesolve      modulesDirectories [         jsbowercomponents     ],     alias          physicsjs PhysicsJSdist,          doesnt find physicsjs.js          physicsjs PhysicsJSdistphysicsjs.js          doesnt find the submodules      , codepre  pThe directory structure looks something like thisp  precode js    main.js    bowermodules      PhysicsJS        dist          physicsjs.js  module entry point          bodies            rectangle.js  desired submodule    lib      MyModule.js codepre  pNote that PhysicsJS does have a minified version of the entire library, which I will use if there is no other alternative, but I would rather only load what I actually use.p  pAlso, the submodules themselves use coderequirephysicsjscode, so calling coderequirephysicsjsphysicsjscode is emnot a solutionem.p
