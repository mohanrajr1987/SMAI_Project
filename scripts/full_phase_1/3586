Positive 3586 pMy first ever stack overflow question, so please forgive any stupiditynaivety on my part here.p  pI have a BizTalk 2010 R2 solution that is using the a hrefhttpwww.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.compatternsmessagingStoreInLibrary.html relnofollow titleClaim CheckClaim Checka  integration pattern implemented with custom pipeline components to move large currently up to 1Gb .mp4 files to a folder location on receive and pick them up again on send so that they dont go through the BizTalkMsgBoxDb.p  pOccasionally we get an error in the receive of the files that leads to exceptions being raised in the receive port.  We use the Enable routing for failed messages setting to avoid the instance suspending in the system, but this causes the large .mp4 file to be dragged into the message box and, ultimately, the EsbExceptionDb.  Obviously not the ideal solution.p  pI could implementent code in the custom receive pipeline component to deal with specific types of error but I do wonder whether there is a better way of handling this so that emanyem exception  expected or unexpected  would result in the large file being routed to a failed file store elsewhere without entering the BizTalkMsgBoxDb at any time.p  pAny advice gratefully received.p

Positive 3586 pIm trying to read a bunch of csv files in SQL Server using SQL Bulk Insert and DataContext.ExecuteCommand. Maybe this isnt the best way to do it, but it does allow me stay in the Type Provider contextas opposed to with SqlBulkCopy I think. Now the upload is glitchy with intermittent success. Some files read in, some fail with Data conversion error truncation. I think this has to do with the row terminators not always working. p  pWhen the upload works, it seems to be with the 0x0A terminator. But when that fails, I want to try repeatedly again with other row terminators. So I want to go into a Try statement, and on failure go into another Try statement, and another if that one fails, ... .

I want to check that the error path works i.e., that an codeonErrorcode handler correctly recovers from an exception thrown in the web worker.p  pThe problem Im running into is that the exception propagating out of the web worker causes it to be considered unhandled.

Negative 3586 pIm looking for a reliable design for handling assignments that have asynchronous requests involved. To further clarify, I have a class which handles Data Management.

If it is not set, it will speak to a Connection Manager a wrapper for NSURLConnection and its delegate methods which fires off an asynchronous request, and this is where problems begin. I cannot guarantee when users will be available. I could change the request to synchronous, but that will directly effect user experience, especially in a mobile environment where bandwidth is limited already.p  pI need to be able to at some point, have some kind of lockingsynchronization code going on in my getter that doesnt return users until it is available or is nil. p  pOnce the NSURLConnection has the data available, it needs to callback somethingsomewhere with a response object and let the getter know the data is available.. whether its failed or succeeded.p  pAny suggestions on handling thisp

Negative 3586 pWhat is the correct way to do conditional formatting in Djangop  pI have a model that contains a date field, and I would like to display a list of records, but colour the rows depending on the value of that date field. For example, records that match todays date I want to be yellow, records that is before today I want green and ones after I want red.p  pSomewhere in Django you will need to do that comparison, comparing the current date with the date in the record.p  pI can see three different places that comparison could be donep  ol liAdd a method to my model, for example, status, that returns either past, present, future and then use that in the template to colour the rows.li liIn the view instead of returning a queryset to the template, preprocess the list and compare each record, build a new dict containing the past, present and future values to be used in the templateli liCreate a new template tag that does the comparison.li ol  pWhich of these methods is the correct Django way of doing it It sounds like conditional formating is something that would come up quite often, and since you cant do arbitrary comparisons in the template some other solution is needed.p  pThe same would apply for simpler formatting rules, for example, if I wanted to display a list of student grades, and I wanted to make the ones higher than 80 green and the ones below 30 red.p

Negative 3586 pIm working on a UI which needs to work in different aspect ratios, 169, 1610, 43p  pThe idea is conceptually simple Everything is centered to the screen in a rough 43 area and anything outside this portion of screen has basic artwork, so something like thisp  pimg srchttpimgur.comhcAjJ.png altalt text not drawn to scalep  pWhere the pink area represents whre all the UI objects are positioned and the blue area is just background and effects.p  pThe trick is in usability, if I pass in coordinates 0,0 in a 43 aspect ratio environment 0,0 would be the top left of the screen. However if Im in a 169 environment 0,0 needs to get renormalized based on the new aspect ratio for it to be in the appropriate place. So my question is How can I achieve thisp  pedit for clarification this is basically for a UI system and while I listed the ratios above as 43, 169, 1610 it should be able to dynamically adjust values for whatever aspect ratio it is set to.p  pedit 2 Just to add more details to the situation When the positions fo rsetting are passed in they are passed in as a  of the screens current widht height, so basically setting position x would be [pos x as portion of screen]SCREENWIDTH where screen width is the width of the current screen itself.p

Negative 3586 pActually the problem arises since we have named a column codeauthorizationcode which is ok on MySQL but fails miserably on Postgres, codeauthorizationcode is a reserved keyword there.p  pWe want to have all schemas in sync even on different databases, so we want to rename codeauthorizationcode in the MySQL catalogues to something neutral. p  pIt would be great if the renaming of the MySQL table columns would work seamlessly with older and newer versions of the applicatation at least for a couple of days so that the transition is smooth.p  pDoes anybody know how to do this A nice idea would be to have some sort of aliasredirection, e.g. create a new column codeauthorizationcode that is actually the same column as codeauthorizationcode but under the new name. Queries using the new name codeautorizationcode will work as well as queries using the old name. Then we can update the application. If all servers have the latest binaries, we can drop the alias and rename the column.p  pAny ideas Any help is greatly appreciated.p
Negative 3586 pWe are loading some xaml for an Element at runtime XamlReader.Load for some preview purposes. Need less to say, the propertiesbindings are not know as they can vary across elementscontrols we are loading. p  pAs the run time view model context is not available when we load the control for preview  after loading the Element, the idea is to grab the binding information, create a type with those propertes at run time, to assign the same as the data context of the loaded control. p  pWell be using AssemblyBuilderModuleBuilderTypeBuilder to build a type at run time. Having said that, we need to walk the visual tree to identify the bindings involved, to create a list of binding paths.p  pObviously, one way is to use regex to parse the xaml directly and build this list.. Just want to know a way exist so that I can grab the bindings and related paths from the visual tree itselfp  pThanksp

Negative 3586 pHey guys  Im looking at using ELMAH for the first time but have a requirement that needs to be met that Im not sure how to go about achieving...p  pBasically, I am going to configure ELMAH to work under asp.net MVC and get it to log errors to the database when they occur. On top of this I be using customErrors to direct the user to a friendly message page when an error occurs. Fairly standard stuff... p  pThe requirement is that on this custom error page I have a form which enables to user to provide extra information if they wish. Now the problem arises due to the fact that at this point the error is already logged and I need to associate the loged error with the users feedback.p  pNormally, if I was using my own custom implementation, after I log the error I would pass through the ID of the error to the custom error page so that an association can be made. But because of the way that ELMAH works, I dont think the same is quite possible.p  pHence I was wondering how people thought that one might go about doing this....p  pCheersp  pUPDATEp  pMy solution to the problem is as followsp  precodepublic class UserCurrentConextUsingWebContext  IUserCurrentConext      private const string StoredExceptionName  System.StoredException.     private const string StoredExceptionIdName  System.StoredExceptionId.      public virtual string UniqueAddress              get  return HttpContext.Current.Request.UserHostAddress            public Exception StoredException              get  return HttpContext.Current.Application[StoredExceptionName  this.UniqueAddress] as Exception          set  HttpContext.Current.Application[StoredExceptionName  this.UniqueAddress]  value            public string StoredExceptionId              get  return HttpContext.Current.Application[StoredExceptionIdName  this.UniqueAddress] as string          set  HttpContext.Current.Application[StoredExceptionIdName  this.UniqueAddress]  value        codepre  pThen when the error occurs, I have something like this in my Global.asaxp  precodepublic void ErrorLogLoggedobject sender, ErrorLoggedEventArgs args      var item  new UserCurrentConextUsingWebContext     item.StoredException  args.Entry.Error.Exception     item.StoredExceptionId  args.Entry.Id   codepre  pThen where ever you are later you can pull out the details by p  precode    var item  new UserCurrentConextUsingWebContext     var error  item.StoredException     var errorId  item.StoredExceptionId     item.StoredException  null     item.StoredExceptionId  null codepre  pNote this isnt 100 perfect as its possible for the same IP to have multiple requests to have errors at the same time. But the likely hood of that happening is remote. And this solution is independent of the session, which in our case is important, also some errors can cause sessions to be terminated, etc. Hence why this approach has worked nicely for us.p

Negative 3586 pIm migrating a large number of standalone pages into content pages.  Most of this involves little more than copying and pasting a GridView from one page into the new page.  However, I find that styling disappears in the new project, i.e. the styles as classes are still present in the stylesheet, but these classes are no longer applied to GridView table elements.p  pExample, in the old project, once a table is rendered by the GridView, its header row has a class of HeaderStyle, but in the new project this is lost, without any editing of the GridView.  Is there some mysterious, builtin mechanism that automatically applies these attributes to GridView elements that I have somehow disabledp

Negative 3586 pOn Mac OS X 10.6, if I start a YouTube video download and pull the Ethernet cable for 5 or so seconds, then plug it back in, I get varying results depending on the browser. With Opera and Chrome, after I plug the cable back in the video continues to load. But with Safari and Firefox, it never does.p  pUsing Wireshark to look at the traffic, I found that Opera and Chrome simply ACK the first packet from YouTube after the cable has been plugged back in, but Safari and Firefox set the RST flag 0x4 in the TCP header and no more traffic follows.p  pI can put a HUB in between the machine and the internet connection, the problem goes away and all four browsers continue loading the video when the cable is plugged back into the HUB. Again, looking at the Wireshark logs, its evident that the machine doesnt see the Mulitcast connection close and there is simply a delay in the packets flowing through.p  pSo it seems that if Safari and Firefox sees a Multicast connection close, and then later see data on that same connection, they will send a RST.p  pMy question is why What is the correct course of action, and why are 24 browsers doing it one way, while the other 24 are doing it another way Is there somewhere in the code that I can see where this is happening in Firefox, for instancep  pThank you very much.p

The problem is I have to JOIN them and the search takes 0.3 seconds which to me makes no sense because the slow aspects of the combined query on Table B should be quicker because we are now only searching over a fraction of that table  ie it should not be doing a full table scan because the field that is being JOINED on is indexed.p

Negative 3586 pIm writing some code that has to cascade delete records in a certain database, and I noticed a drop in performance as the database has more records in it. When I just fill the database it doesnt seem like there is a big drop in performance between the start of the filling and right at the end, yet when I do a cascade delete performance goes down with a bigger database. Im assuming that it would need to make a lot of joins for the cascade to find all the related records in other tables, which causes it to slow down on bigger datasets. But when I just add a record, wouldnt it also have to test for already existing primary keys and other unique constraints and wouldnt this also have to be slower in bigger datasets, or is this so incredibly fast compared to the delete process that its hard to notice a performace drop when youre just filling a database Or are the cascades just slow because I didnt specifically index the tables that it cascades top  pSo secondly, would indexing the tables it cascades to speed up the cascading if those tables already have a generated id as primary key In a more general sense are primary keys automatically indexedp

Negative 3586 pI have not come up with a good, clean way to do this, so I will bring my woes to youp  pI want to represent a configuration in XML.

I have a base configuration which I will represent as config.xml which might have some contents like thisp  precode... ltconfiggt   ltelementa value3.2 gt   ltelementb valuehello world gt ltconfiggt ... codepre  pTheres a schema associated that says both of those fields are required. One is a float and one is a string. Now I have another configuration which is similar to the first with one minor change. I would like to represent it like thisp  precode... ltinclude baseconfigconfig.xmlgt ltconfiggt   ltelementa value1.5 gt ltconfiggt ... codepre  pIn effect, this new configuration pulls all the elements from the base configuration file and only specifies what its overriding.

Negative 3586 pI wrote some code in java to push exceptions from a thread to the main thread, by queueing them in a wrapper seperate class. Now, if there is any exception present in the wrapper, the thread dies. Then the exceptions have to be thrown on the main thread. There doesnt seem to be a standard java event that is called on the main thread, so I had to use the join function on the thread somewhere. I cant use join in the main thread, because then the main thread blocks. I cant use it in another thread, then I couldnt throw exceptions any more. I cant think of any other way to throw exceptions on the main thread. Anyone here has an ideap
Negative 3586 pWe have a fairly hightraffic static site i.e. no server code, with lots of images, scripts, css, hosted by IIS 7.0p  pWed like to turn on some caching to reduce server load, and are considered setting the expiry of web content to be some time in the future. In IIS, we can do this on a global level via Expire web content section of the common http headers in the IIS response header module. Perhaps setting content to expire 7 days after serving.p  pAll this actually does is sets the codemaxagecode HTTP response header, so far as I can tell, which makes sense, I guess.p  pNow, the confusion p  ol lipFirstly, all browsers Ive checked IE9, Chrome, FF4 seem to ignore this and still make conditional requests to the server to see if content has changed. So, Im not entirely sure what the maxage response header will actually effect Could it be older browsers Or webcaches pli lipIt is possible that we may want to change an image in the site at short notice... Im guessing that if the maxage emisem actually used by something that, by its very nature, it wont then check if this image has changed for 7 days... so thats not what we want eitherpli ol  pI wonder if a best practice is to partition ones site into folders of content really wont change often and only turn on some longterm expiry for these folders Perhaps to vary the querystring to force a refresh of content in these folders if needed e.g. assetsimagesbackground.pngversion2 p  pAnyway, having looked through the rather dry a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgProtocolsrfc2616rfc2616sec13.html relnofollowHTTP specificationa, and some of the a hrefhttpwww.mnot.netcachedocs relnofollowtutorialsa, I still dont really have a feel for whats right in our situation.p  pAny realworld experience of a situation similar to ours would be most appreciated p

Negative 3586 pI would like to be able to create bar charts with JFreeChart that looks similar to the following picture.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comK4QoP.png altthe desired resultp  pIt is a very basic monocolored bar chart, but with one fancy detail the diagonal stripes. I was thinking that this could be made possible by overlaying another picture on top of the normal bar. This picture would have the same dimensions as the bar, have diagonal white stripes and a transparent background. I am not quite sure how to do this though, as I have very little GUI experience, but I found a a hrefhttpwww.ioncannon.netjava139spiffingupjfreechartcharts relnofollowvery useful articlea that deals with overlaying images on top of graphics from JFreeChart, so I am quite certain I should be able to pull that of. p  pBut how should I create the diagonal stripes I see how I could distribute the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, but not the capped lines in the upper left and lower right corner. Can I somehow paint outside the rectangle and not have it included in the picturep  pstrongeditstrong After some searching I cannot see that my suggestion of overlaying an image with a transparent background would work, as I cannot find any examples on how to do this. On the other hand, merely painting the lines on the rectangle is probably easier. p

Negative 3586 pIm developing a graphical application for Android tablets but Ive recently started having a strange problem. The application runs fine on the emulator, but whenever I try to install it on the tablet a Zenithink ZT180 tablet running Android 2.2, I get the Application not installed error.p  pIve tried to narrow the problem down and it seems it may be somehow related to the provided resources. I commented out all use of bitmaps in the application, and removed all bitmaps except the icon from the resdrawable directory, and compiled the application. That version installed without errors. Next, I placed a single additional bitmap 10241000 png, 1.15Mb in the resdrawable directory  I did not load it in the code or anything, I just placed the bitmap in the directory and recompiled the application. This time, the installation failed with the Application not installed error.p  pThis seems rather strange to me  how can a single new bitmap in the resources mess up the installation, when it isnt even used by the application Any insight would be appreciatedp  h3Update due to mibollmas commenth3  pI installed it by copying the .apk file from the PC onto a USB disk, inserting the USB disk into the tablet, and activating the .apk installer from the USB disk using the tablets file explorer. At a slighly different point in my debugging I tried to copy the .apk first onto the tablets internal memory storage, but that didnt help at least at that time.p  pNote that the simple application the one that doesnt have any images besides the icon does install fine like this, as does the basic Hello Android application. The trouble apparently happens when I try to add more graphics into the resources...p

Negative 3586 pWeve been using Rabbit successfully for about a year.  Recently have upgraded to v2.6.1, because we want to use clusters with replicated message queues.p  pMy testing has hit a puzzling behavior that smells like a Rabbit bug to me.  The test that uncovers this is working with a twonode cluster.  Both nodes are running v2.6.1.  Both nodes have disk.  Both nodes are running on Mac OS, though I doubt this is pertinent.p  pIm also running Alice on the node that runs the test.  The test uses it to programmatically do a stopapp on one of the nodes, because the test is trying to validate that if the cluster master fails, and a slave is elevated to take its place, that we dont lose messages.p  pSo, the test has a small thread pool, which is given tasks that periodically 1 publish messages, and 2 toggle the state of the Rabbit master node stopped if running started if stopped.  Other threads are consuming messages from queues.p  pIm using publisher confirms, and Im also acknowledging the messages in the consumers using autoAckfalse for channel.basicConsume.p  pWhen the master node is stopped, I see both the producers and consumers catching ShutdownSignalException.  They handle this by attempting to reconnect to the cluster.  This works fine.  When reconnected, they continue with their business.p  pSometimes, what I see is that a consumer has successfully fetched a message from the broker, and is calling channel.basicAck when it gets that ShutdownSignalException.p  pLater, when the consumer has reconnected, it again pulls down the same message.  The message bodies are tagged with a UUID, so I know it is the same one.  This time, when the consumer attempts to basicAck the message, it again gets ShutdownSignalException, but this one has the following text in it replytextPRECONDITIONFAILED  unknown delivery tag 7.p  pIn fact, that is the same delivery tag that was offered to the consumer by the broker before the master went down and the consumer reconnected.p  pGoogling suggests that this event means that the consumer is attempting to ack the same message more than once.p  pBut, how can this be so  If the first ack succeeded, then the message should have been removed from the brokers queues, and the consumer shouldnt see the same message again.p  pYet, if the first ack did not succeed, then the consumer shouldnt be dinged for attempting to reack the message.p  pAnyone seen this before  It smells like a bug in Rabbits replicated queues to me, but Ive still new to Rabbit, and so am willing to believe theres a subtlety here in consuming from a clustered broker that I havent yet grokkedp  pThanks, Stevep

Negative 3586 pIve been working for the last week on trying to speed up the search results on a site. What weve been working on is moving the paging on the site to SQL. This has sped up the paging drastically, however I still need to query the entire table again to get the total count of the records in that table.p  pI am caching the totals and only rerunning this part of the query when the user alters search parameters to speed up the paging and this works nicely. The issue we are having now is that the load on the CPU of the SQL server is increasing drasticlly and as such the performance of the paging fluctuates drastically between 100 milliseconds and 2 seconds. p  pI am just wondering if it wouldnt be better to cache the entire results table on the web server and use either codeDataTable.Selectcode or a Linq Statement to query the memory table  list I realise this will add a large memory load to the Web Server, but we are trying to improve speed and as such it may be worth while to upgrade the Web Servers as they are also load balanced, whereas the SQL box is not.p

So weve used the Surface 2 SDK for most controls and its all touchhappy.p  pI have noticed recently, though, that one of our custom controls isnt working as it should. This control provides popout menus, and these are achieved through the Popup control. On a developers laptop, this works fine and the menus vanish when you click away from them. Ive noticed, though, that on our test tablet they have a tendency to stay open.p  pI found that there was a SurfacePopup in the first Surface SDK, but I cant find one in the Surface 2 SDK. Did they get rid of it Is there a best practice approachp  pIf theres no simple solution, I may have to go oldschool and add a windowsized hidden SurfaceButton below the menu when it appears, that hides itself and the menu when clicked or touched.p  pBeyond that Ive noticed that sometimes the SurfaceScrollViewer within the popups wont work. Im guessing this is because its not picking up touch events properly. I tried adding this extension method to the window..p  precodethis.EnableSurfaceInput codepre  p..but I get a NullReferenceException on codeSystem.Windows.Input.Mouse.getLeftButtoncode which bizarrely suggests that it can only enable surface inputs for controls when theres a mouse plugged in.p  pAny ideas Theyll all be welcomed with open armsp

Negative 3586 psuppose I want to allow people run simple console java programs on my server without ability to access the file system, the network or other IO except via my own highly restricted API. But, I dont want to get too deep into operating system level restrictions, so for the sake of the current discussion I want to consider code level sanitization methods.p  pSo suppose I try to achieve this restriction as follows. I will prohibit all import statements except for those explicitly whitelisted lets say import SanitizedSystemIO.em is allowed while import java.io.em is not and I will prohibit the string java. anywhere in the code. So this way the user would be able to write code referencing File class from SanitizedSystemIO, but he will not be able to reference java.io.File. This way the user is forced to use my sanitized wrapper apis, while my own framework code which will compile and run together with users code, such as in order to provide the IO functionality can access all regular java apis.p  pWill this approach work Or is there a way to hack it to get access to the standard java apip  pETA ok, first of all, it should of course be java. strings not system.. I think in C, basically...p  pSecond, ok, so people say, use security manager or use class loader approaches. But what, if anything, is wrong with the code analysis approach One benefit of it to my mind is the sheer KISS simplicity  instead of figuring out all the things to check and sanitize in SecurityManager we just allow a small whitelist of functionality and block everything else. Implementationwise this is a trivial exercise for people with minimal knowledge of java.p  pAnd to reiterate my original question, so can this be hacked Is there some java language construct that would allow access to the underlying api despite such code restrictionsp

Negative 3586 pI am using Curlpp to send requests to various webservices to send and receive data. So far this has worked fine since i have only used it for sendingreceiving JSON data.p  pNow i have a situation where a webservice returns a zip file in binary form. This is where i encountered a problem where the data received is not complete.p  pI first had Curl set to write any data to a ostringstream by using the option WriteStream, but this proved not to be the correct approach since the data contained null characters, and thus the data stopped at the first null char.p  pAfter that, instead of using WriteStream i used WriteFunction with a callback function. The problem in this case is that this function is always called 2 or 3 times, regardless of the amount of data. This results in always having a few chunks of data that dont seem to be the first part of the file, although the data always contains PK as the first 2 characters, indicating a zip file.p  pI used several tools to verify that the data is entirely being sent to my application so this is not a problem of the webservice.p  pHere the code. Do note that the options like hostname, port, headers and postfields are set elsewhere.p  precodestring requestData  sizet WriteStringCallbackchar ptr, sizet size, sizet nmemb      requestData  ptr     int totalSize sizenmemb     return totalSize   const string CurlRequestPerform      curlppoptionsWriteFunction wfWriteStringCallback     thisgtrequest.setOpt wf      thisgtrequest.perform      return requestData  codepre  pI hope anyone can help me out with this issue because ive run dry of any leads on how to fix this, also because curlpp is poorly documentedand even worse since the curlpp website disappeared.p

Negative 3586 pIm reading data from a constantly updated text file, roughly around every 0.51 second. Currently I have it worked out by using the refresh header in my PHP script, and Im using jpgraph library to generate the graph. However the problem is that the graph is rather large, around 1500x900, and so the image ends up taking the entire refresh time to reload.p  pI was wondering if there is some other way that lets the graph be generated without having to send so much data to the client using jpgraph I assume that I might be using the library wrong.p  pOr should I just use a client side graph charter and give access to the text file on the server to the client sidep

Negative 3586 pIm using the a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenbook.sockets.php relnofollowPHP sockets extensiona basically a wrapper around the codesocket2coderelated linux syscalls and would like to reuse sockets I open while serving one request in the subsequent ones. Performance is a critical factor.p  pThe sockets I open are all to the same IP, which makes the use of other functions like codepfsockopencode impossible because it reuses same single socket every time and I need several at a time.p  pstrongThe questionstrongp  pIf I leave the sockets I open serving one request deliberately open, I dont call codesocketclosecode or codesocketshutdowncode and connect a socket with the exact same parameters to the same IP serving the next request will linux reuse the previously opened socket  filedescriptorp  pWhat I want to do in the end is to avoid TCPhandshakes on every request.p  pstrongAdditional informationstrongp  ul lipI use the apache worker MPM  which means that different request emcan beem but are not necessarily served from different processes.

Negative 3586 pI have used the .Net MySQL connector to import a Dataset of a MySQL schema into Visual Studio.p  pVisual Studio has generated a code.xsdcode file for me with a visual representation of the tables, and fields within those tables in my schema.p  pI am then running queries against these tables using LINQ.p  pBy default, the codeNullValuecode property of every field in every table is set to Throw exception. What this means in practice is that if I apply criteria to any column which contains null values in a query, an Exception is thrown when I try to enumerate through the results as shown belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comf5ytm.jpg altExceptionp  pThe easy way to fix this is to change the NullValue property of that particular column to either codeNullcode or codeEmptycode, but I have a lot of columns in a lot of tables and changing all of these one at a time is a pain. I cant use the Shift key to select all columns either, as the codeNullcode and codeEmptycode values only apply to reference types and nullable value types, so if, for example, my selection contains a single integer, none of the properties will get updated.p  pIs there an option in Visual Studio to change the default behaviour of the NullValue property on a column in a DataTable across the boardp  pThanksp

Negative 3586 pSay I have a table with 5000 records, and another table containing a list of 5 topics. Each topic is associated with 1000 records in the larger table  each comment has a topic field which is a foreign key to the topics table.p  pFor example, if the database stores all users comments on a website. There will be 1000 comments on topic A, 1000 on topic B etc...p  pIf I want to obtain all the comments on  a particular topic, I would have to write a query to obtain the correct 1000 rows out of a possible 5000. What if instead I created 5 tables, each table storing comments about a particular topic only.p  pAssuming there would never be more than maybe 40 topics, is this a sensible approach to database design I cant see any obvious disadvantages, but it seems like it will produce faster query results.p
Negative 3586 pI have a LightSwitch screen which consists of a List containing a CustomControl.  This CustomControl has a set of dependency properties which are bound to the properties on the entity through TwoWay bindings.p  pOn one of the dependency properties on the CustomControl I have a PropertyChangedCallback which executes a method on the LightSwitch page.  This then runs some calculations across the collection of items the list is bound to.p  pMost of the time this is fine, however on some occasions it appears that the calculations are run before the change that triggered them are pushed through to the entity from the TwoWay bindings on the CustomControl.  How do I resolve this  I need to ensure that the code within the LightSwitch page is run after the change to the CustomControl dependency property is pushed from the TwoWay binding.p  pCreate the binding on the CustomControl byp  precode     SetBindingAxleNumberProperty, new BindingValue.Number  Mode  BindingMode.TwoWay   codepre  pDependency property looks likep  precode     public static readonly DependencyProperty AxleNumberProperty          DependencyProperty.RegisterAxleNumber, typeofint, typeofAxleViewer, new PropertyMetadatad, e gt AxleViewerd.RecalculateSquare  codepre  pMy callback on the dependency property looks likep  precode     private void RecalculateSquare              IContentItem contentItem  IContentItemDataContext         IScreenDetails screenDetails  contentItem.Screen.Details          screenDetails.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke gt screenDetails.Commands[UpdateSquare].Execute       codepre  pThen within the screen I havep  precode     partial void UpdateSquareExecute               perform calculation on this.Axles      codepre

Negative 3586 pI have a java web application that is deployed in two EARs  one for the UI tier contains a WAR module and one for the business tier contains an EJB module.

As it is a subclass of codejava.util.Datecode and is serializable, shouldnt this be handledp  pIve spoken to a more experience person who has said the likely cause is that the JVM version or codeDBTimestampcode class version is different between the web and business tier WAS servers. Both servers have the same JVM, WAS, and JAR version.p  pI also have a local WAS 7 server, where both tiers are deployed to the same server. The EJBs are still resolved remotely via a JNDI call to localhost. The application works fine on my local server. The only difference Im aware of is a different microversion of WAS, as well as deploying both tiers to the same server.p  pWhat is the cause of the problem Is it that the codeDBTimestampcode class cant be found on the web tier, or that the version of the class is different Or is it an issue with polymorphism, or something else entirelyp  pAside from an answer, Id also appreciate any advice on what debugging to try  Im out of ideas.p

Ive set up jakehetfield s saveImage method and placed just the save to documents code inside like sop  precode     voidsaveImageUIImageimage      NSArray paths  NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomainsNSDocumentDirectory,             NSUserDomainMask, YES     NSString documentsDirectory  [paths objectAtIndex0]     NSString savedImagePath  [documentsDirectory            stringByAppendingPathComponentsavedImage.png]     UIImage image  imageView.image  imageView is my image from camera     NSData imageData  UIImagePNGRepresentationimage     [imageData writeToFilesavedImagePath atomicallyNO]      [self performSelectorInBackgroundselectorsaveImage withObjectimage]  codepre  pBut the line UIImage image  imageView.image is suddenly returning the build error Redefinition of image. This is confusing because that same line works when I ran the save to documents code in the PickerDidFinish... method. Any ideas of how I can fix this errorp  pThanks in advance p

No matter what I do, its an immediate error when I try to retrieve these ordinary files over HTTP.p  pIt would be relatively okay to deal with if there were others suffering from this on my site, but theyre not.

This is my first question and hope the only such big and abstract.p  pThe question is strongshould I focus on WebSharper for web development sites, services, or go with Cplain F and ASP.NET MVCServiceStackTypeScriptsomething elsestrong. The main criterium is time to a working although probably not productionready, tracerbullet solution that could scale in principle that is, it will not require a complete rewrite or unreasonable  if suddenly need to scale so that I could continue to bootstrap my projects as long and as fast as I can.p  pI have read all questions on Web at SO and googled a lot, just to become more uncertain.p  pI started to learn F recently and am very excited because this language really makes a huge difference for my main project datarich caclualtionheavy engine compared to C due to all the lauded features of F. Therefore I have already decided to invest my time in the language itself.p  pIn addition to the engine, I need a user webinterface, webservice and I also have another project which is a social website. For these, I am considering Websharper but cannot find enough data to decide for Web over more traditional approaches, mainly ServiceStackpowered.p  pstrongPros for Web and F as a single languages for most purposesstrongp  ul liSingle language for all purposes, hoping that F is the next big thing and toolingrich IDE support will come soon ReSharper likeli liWeb emlooksem great, productive, logical and well documentedli liBy using Web I will better and faster learn F for really hard thingsli liInteractive F is great for prototyping and idea development  this is probably true for web development as wellli liWebShaper usage is promoted in the book Expert F 2.03.0 and the book adds to Web documentation, however CEO of Webs parent IntelliFactory is a coauthor of the book, and that explains why Web is endorsed in the book. Web could be really good and the promotion be welldeserved, but a second thought about conflcit of interests lights up.li liThe fact that you are using F code from both server and client side allows for transparent transfer of data using the same types for both client and serverside code, no manual wiring involved.li liYou could use the exact same code for validation on the server and client side.li liBuilding markup dynamically on the client side is just as simple and allows you to only have to transfer data over the wire.li ul  pstrongConsstrongp  ul liVery limited realworld examples of Web sites li liPoor toolingIDE support compared to C li liLess flexibility, limiting myself to a specific way to do things and to existing extensionsli liServiceStack offers already implemented proven patterns and has a solid architechture e.g. I definetly need DTOs over chatty webapis for connecting desktop clients to the server calculation engineli liNew a hrefhttpwww.typescriptlang.orgTypeScripta brings static typing and great tooling support for JavaScript and solves a lot of problems I had with developping and maintaining JS scripts.

I know that the correct way how to get manufacturer of a product isp  precodeproduct  productServicegtgetProduct5 manufacturer  manufacturerServicegtgetManufacturerByProductproduct codepre  pBut I think that the fluent solution is much simplier  its easy to understand and fun to use. Actually its pretty natural. I tried to implement this by callbacks.

Negative 3586 pI got a strange situation here where I need help.p  pI create a fairly simple JFace Table using a codeTableViewercode. When you do nothing more, you can see the following behavior when a cells text is too large, a tooltip showing the complete text will appear after a short wait. Thats normal behavior and I guess that the native controls draw these tooltips.p  pNow I added my own custom tooltips, usingp  precodeColumnViewerToolTipSupport.enableFor tableViewer, ToolTip.NORECREATE  codepre  pAnd delivering a different text using codegetToolTipTextcode method of a label provider.p  pThat works  almost. I got one problem sometimes not all the times first, the native tooltip appears and shortly thereafter my custom tooltip is drawn on top of it, like shown in this screenshotp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcnYr1.png altScreenshot showing two tooltipsp  pI have no idea how to effectively disable the native tooltips each cell wants to draw. Its ugly as hell the way it is...p  pAny clues for me Thanksp

Negative 3586 pIm trying to use OpenDyslexic as a font option in a Swing application. But surprisingly, OpenDyslexic looks much bigger than any other font at the same point size, even though it looks normally sized in other applications. Ive tried a handful of other OpenType fonts, and they dont look especially large or small. Why is OpenDyslexic so big in Java, and how can I get Java to size it normally so I dont have to specialcase the size of OpenDyslexicp  pOn Oracle JRE I tried 1.7.011, 1.7.015, and the latest 1.7.021 on all OSes, the font is too big when Java loads the font file using codeFont.createFontcode. However, when I stronginstallstrong the font into the operating system, the behavior is different on all 3 platformsp  ul liIn Linux, installing the font to code.fontscode does no good. The screenshot looks the same before installing the font and after installing it.li liIn Windows, installing the font fixes the font emglyphsem, but the font emspacingem is still too big See screenshot below.li liIn OS X, installing the font fixes it It looks like a normalsized font on OS X.li ul  pstrongUpdatestrong Interestingly, OpenJDK both the 7u21 Ubuntu package in Linux and the obuildfactory build on OS X does strongnotstrong exhibit the bug. The 15pt OpenDyslexic m is 15px wide on OpenJDK, as it should be, both when the font is created from file and when the font is handled by the operating system. The bug is in the latest Oracle JRE but not in the latest OpenJDK.p  pHeres my example program. Note that to try it, you need to put the a hrefhttpopendyslexic.org relnofollowOpenDyslexica files into resources. Alternatively, install OpenDyslexic into your system and take out the coderegisterFontscode call.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4Oa6e.png altSansSerif is normal size img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comyB48V.png altOpenDyslexic is huge at the same point size img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comM1OMq.png altAfter installing OpenDyslexic on Windows, it looks stupid img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZw5rL.png altAfter installing font on OS X perfectp  precodeimport java.awt.BorderLayout import java.awt.Component import java.awt.Font import java.awt.FontFormatException import java.awt.GraphicsEnvironment import java.io.IOException import java.io.InputStream import java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException import java.util.Arrays import java.util.HashSet import java.util.Locale  import javax.swing.DefaultComboBoxModel import javax.swing.DefaultListCellRenderer import javax.swing.JComboBox import javax.swing.JFrame import javax.swing.JList import javax.swing.JPanel import javax.swing.JTextArea import javax.swing.SwingUtilities import javax.swing.WindowConstants import javax.swing.event.ListDataEvent import javax.swing.event.ListDataListener  public class FontFrame             Register extra fonts from resources.

The usual pattern seems to be where native code has a longrunning loop, and developers try to clean up every single local reference as they go to avoid hitting the local reference limit, but they accidentally also delete the reference they want to use as a return value  The fix is trivial dont call DeleteLocalRef on a reference youre going to use where use includes return. codepre  pI am little confused about the inconsistency. p

Negative 3586 pThe situation is that at my place of work, we have a call data recorder CDR feeding data into a server through a serial port. As I understand it, the good data from this is a record of all the calls made, which is of course bound up in the expenditure of money.p  pAs I understand it, the serial port on the server was set to accept data in terms of 9600 baud, 8bit, noparity, with 1 stop bit it was intended to be set to accept data in terms of 9600 baud, 7bit, noparity, with 1 stop bit.p  pAlthough that setting has been corrected now, there is a large amount of data from the CDR which is currently unintelligible, though the files would normally be readable in something as simple as Notepad.p  pMy question is A. Whether its even possible to recover readable data, and B. How I could accomplish this in terms of C would be ideal, but not necessary. I had had thoughts of decoding the data straight down to the bits and reencoding into a readable format, but I have come to realize that Im not certain of the actual formats involved for example, my limited research has led me to believe that the 7bit, noparity, 1 stop bit, data would be considered true ASCII, but Im not certain of the validity of that.p  pMany of the previously asked questions deal with serial port handling in code. I suppose Id like to know if I can translate this received data into a readable format.p
Negative 3586 pIm developing a web for a client who wants a parallax effect applied to all the foreground elements no background parallax. This web is 1234px width by like 9000px in height all images, big background images and PNG with transparencies for the foreground elements and has a couple of foreground elements. Ive achieved this effect using stellar.js with iscroll.js to create a new scrollbar based on iOS. The parallax is smooth and simple, you scroll down, the elements go up and viceversa, but the problem I have I already contacted the stellar.js developer but Im still waiting for an answer, hope he see this   is that Ive got that bouncy effect that in some situations it stucks my viewport at a certain scrollTop. Lets say, I load the web and everything is ok, but suddenly I go to the top of the page for example it happens at any scrollTop, it bounces and shows the checkerboard like iOS, and then it stops at like a couple of pixels down from the top, when I try to scroll up from there, it bounces back to that location.p  pI found some posts with this problem searching here at SO, and the answer that helped me in some way from start Ive got this problem but I couldnt even scroll down is this onep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11006601iscrollnotscrollingcontentjustbouncesbacktotop1587968315879683iScroll Not scrolling content, just bounces back to topap  pThat post describes the same problem I have with stellariscroll, and changing those CSS properties helped me to minimize the bounce, but it still happens. I tried a lot of height combinations to the codewrappercode codescrollercode elements, but following that answer means that my codescrollercode is like a lot more taller than the content, so when I scroll down I see this huge black background, until it bounces back to the bottom of the content.p  pIll provide you with some code, cant share the web because its not finished and my client asked me to not share it.p  pThis is in the codeltheadgtcode, here I initialize the plugin, I took the template from the stellar.js tutorial on mobile parallax a hrefhttpmarkdalgleish.com201210mobileparallaxwithstellarjs relnofollowhttpmarkdalgleish.com201210mobileparallaxwithstellarjsap  precodeltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth, initialscale0.62, maximumscale0.62, minimumscale0.62, userscalablenogt  ltscript srcjsvendorjquery1.9.1.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srcjsvendoriscroll.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srcjsvendorjquery.stellar.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt      function loaded        var ua  navigator.userAgent,         isMobileWebkit  WebKit.testua ampamp Mobile.testua        if isMobileWebkit          html.addClassmobile               function loaded         var myScroll          if isMobileWebkit               setTimeoutfunction   myScroll  new iScrollwrapper,  useTransform true, useTransition false   , 5000              setTimeoutfunction   myScroll.refresh , 10000            scroller.stellar             scrollProperty transform,             positionProperty transform,                     else            .stellar             horizontalScrolling false,                                       document.addEventListenerDOMContentLoaded, function   setTimeoutloaded, 100 , false     document.addEventListenerDOMContentLoaded, loaded, false  ltscriptgt  ltbody onloadloadedgt ltdiv idwrappergt     ltdiv idscrollergt         ltdiv idfg datarolecontentgt              lt all the backgrounds, I load them with the js preloader and apply them as a backgroundimage gt             ltdiv idrffbg0gtltdivgt             ltdiv idrffbg1gtltdivgt             ltdiv idrffbg2gtltdivgt             ltdiv idrffbg3gtltdivgt             ltdiv idrffbg4gtltdivgt              ltdiv idnavbar datapositionfixedgt lt This navbar has to be fixed because is used to navigate the web                 ltsome buttons heregt             ltdivgt              lt lots of divs, these are the foreground parallax elements, all with the datastellarratio, this is working great gt          ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt ltbodygt codepre  pCSS, Ill share the specific parts that affect the parallax, both stellar and iscroll plugins, this snippet was also taken from the stellar tutorial mentioned abovep  precode.mobile body    overflow hidden   .mobile wrapper    position absolute   top 0   bottom 0   left 0   width 100   height 9052px   zindex 1   backgroundcolor 000   .mobile scroller      height 20000px     backgroundcolor 000  codepre

Negative 3586 pHere is the table structurep  precodeID FIELDA FIELDB DATEFIELD VALUEFIELD codepre  pThe ID field is just a number that increments with each record. We get 2 sets of records in a day where FIELDA, FIELDB, DATEFIELD are exactly the same but the VALUEFIELD can be different. We get a morning set and an evening set. You can tell which is which because of the ID value being lower for that set of records for the morning set because they were inserted first and the ID being higher for the evening records because they were inserted after in that set.p  pThe question is, if I want to have a view that looks at the highest ID value for FIELDA, FIELDB, DATEFIELD for every record how would I do that Basically I dont care about the morning sets in my view for anything and only want to see the evening. However, on the current day if we are still in the morning the highest ID value will be the only ID value at that time and so a maxid will give me what we have for current day in the morning at least.p

Negative 3586 pI am using many python packages like numpy, bottleneck, h5py, ... for my daily work on my computer. Since I am root on this machine it is no problem to install these packages. However I would like to use my environment of different packages also on a server machine where I only have a normal user account. So I thought about creating a virtual environment with virtualenv on my machine by installing all needed packages in there. Then I just copy the whole folder to the server and can run everything from itp  pMy machine uses Fedora 19 whereas the server uses Ubuntu. Is this a problem I could not find any information on how to move such a virtual environment to another system. The reason I would like to create the virtual environment on my machine first is that there are a lot of tools missing on the server like pythondev, so I cant compile numpy for instance.p  pI looked into Anaconda and Enthought Python distributions, but they dont include a couple of packages I need. Also, there should be a completely open way for this problem p  pMoving the virtual environment to the server failed, since it is complaining about some missing files when I import the packages. This is not surprising probably...p

It successfully packages my program into an .exe that works properly on my machine.  However, when I try to port it to another Windows machine and run it, the GUI works but the system calls do not.

Negative 3586 pIm currently working on a website built by a previous developer. This website has previously sent links to subscribers with spaces in the url filenames, for example codehttpwebsite.comdocsthis is a pdf.pdfcode.

For example, if a user were to request codehttpwebsite.comdocsthis is a pdf.pdfcode the .htaccess will redirect to codehttpwebsite.comdocsthis20is20a20pdf.pdfcode.

Negative 3586 pSo, pretty simple question.  Ignoring the implications of overuse of the singleton pattern.  Im trying to find a reliable singleton patter in ObjectiveC.  I have come across thisp  precodeimplementation SomeSingleTonClass  static SomeSingleTonClass singleInstance   SomeSingleTonClassgetInstance      static dispatchoncet dispatchOnceToken      dispatchonceampdispatchOnceToken,          singleInstance  [[SomeSingleTonClass alloc] init]           return singleInstance    voidsomeMethodOnTheInstance      NSLogDO SOMET WORK   end codepre  pThis I am fairly happy with but it leads to a lot of thisp  precode[[SomeSingleTonClass getInstance] someMethodOnTheInstance] codepre  pMy question is, why is this better than a purely static class.p  precodeimplementation SomeStaticClass  static NSString someStaticStateVariable   idinit      Dont allow init to initialize any memory state     Perhaps throw an exception to let some other programmer know     not to do this     return nil    voidsomeStaticMethod      NSLogDo Some Work  codepre  pAll you really gain, is mildly cleaner looking method calls.  Basically you swap out thisp  precode[[SomeSingleTonClass getInstance] someMethodOnTheInstance] codepre  pFor thisp  precode[SomeStaticClass someStaticMethod] codepre  pThis is a minor simplification for sure, and you can always store the instance within your class.  This is more intellectual curiosity, what ObjectiveC god am I pissing off by using static classes instead of singletons  Im sure I cant be the first person to think this, but I promise, I did a duplicate search first.  The few answers I found, I felt like were based on older versions of cocoa, because even the discussed singleton patterns seemed to suffer from threading issues.p

Negative 3586 pMy question is about when its OK to merge separate models into one single REST resource and whether this leads to tricky and difficult to work with design, down the line.p  pLets say I have a movie streaming service and users can only watch movie genres they have permissions for. Lets say these are represented with these hypothetical modelsp  ul licodeusers idcodeli licodemoviegenres id, genrenamecodeli licodeuserstogenrespermissions id, genreid, useridcodeli ul  pexposed through REST routes codeuserscode codemoviegenrescode and codeuserstogenrespermissionscodep  pNow, as a user client of this API think a website or a mobile app, in order to find out what genres Im allowed to get hold of, I would fetch the genres permissions and then all the movie genres. Two network calls.p  pHowever, an argument could be made that having to make multiple roundtrips to the API is inefficient, and you additionally have to deal with a bunch of joins on the client. This example is simple enough with its 3 relations, but in the real world you could have much longer chains.p  pThus one could consider collapsing two models into one, and for example return permissions already joined to movie genresp  pcodemoviegenres id, genrename, authorizedforcurrentusercodep  pHowever the question is, this thought process can be taken pretty far. You could save the client a lot of joins and roundtrips by doing all joining on the server. However, at what point do you stop At what point is what you returning no longer a REST resources but a generic blob of data thats been concatenated togetherp  pIs there a rule of thumb for deciding where to draw the linep

Negative 3586 pHello Im getting into Winsock programming in C. I believe that in order for me to access the  or any other header related to Winsock for that matter header file I have to have Visual C 2010 installed and set it as my default compiler. So I download it, and in CodeBlocks I set it to my compiler. I run some Winsock code and I get this message p  precodeCUsersJaredDocumentsTest.c6fatal error C1083 Cannot open include file winsock2.h No such file or directory codepre  pI also get this message for including winsock.h and windows.h. This has something to do with the Visual C compiler. I try installing Visual C 2008 and use it as my compiler and get the same message. I then read that I have to install microsofts SDK. I download and install it and it gets an error saying that I cant install it this is the .Net framework 4.0 version. I then try the 3.5 version and it installs fine but my compiler still cant find the header files. I have the .net framework 4.0 so I dont see  the problem. I also read that I have to include some header files in Visual C by going to ToolsOptionsProjects and SolutionsVC Directories and I get the following message p  precodeVC Directory editing in tools gt options has been deprecated. codepre  pVisual C 2010 no longer supports this feature. Does anyone have a solution or can help me with thisp  pLong story short I cannot include winsock.h, winsock2.h, or windows.h using the Visual C 2010 compiler.p  pAll help is appreciated. p

Negative 3586 pI am using a codeDataGridcode together with a codeListDataProvidercode to display various row data in my application. For most cases, it was fine to fetch everything from the server at once. Now, it appears to be necessary to fetch data on pagination steps. This means, my RPC call returns 10 items each time and the total count of possible results.p  pThe total count is used to setup the attached codeSimplePagercode by manually calling codedatagrid.setRowCounttotalCount, truecode after having set the row data. emAfterem is important here,  because setRowData also triggers a setRowCount call with the concrete number of items always 10 in my case.p  pThe problem is that after having set the row count manually, another participant, a codeScheduledCommandcode triggers a codeflushCommandcode which in turn triggers a codesetRowCountcode call which  sets the count back to 10. The consequence the pager shows 110 of 10 and the pager controls are disabled.p  pHow can I enforce a certain rowCount even if the codeListDataProvidercode only has 10 items each timep  pYou might suggest to use an codeAsyncDataProvidercode. However, there already is a quite complex generic design codeAbstractTablePresenterltDTO, ...gtcode implementing all the logic to fetch data and push it to a generic display  which is backed by ListDataProviders. Hard to explain, but actually, I would prefer keep using the codeListDataProvidercode.p

Negative 3586 pCurrently Im trying to get lighting working on a cylinder object made in blender a basic cylinder scaled on the zaxis, no further processing done and load this object in via Assimp with the following options codeaiProcessGenSmoothNormals  aiProcessTriangulate  aiProcessCalcTangentSpace  aiProcessFlipUVscode. In blenders wavefront export options the codetriangulatecode option is set.p  pThe problem is with some scaling done on the cilinder usually above a certain scaling treshold my OpenGL implementation shows the normals inversed I have a geometry shader that shows the normals and because it inverses the normals, the lighting is inversed as well. This only happens with these cylinderlike objects with certain scaling at least, only then it occured to me. Every other object in my scene works fine, except these cylinders.p  pI have no idea if this has to do with how Assimp loads .obj files, or the way blender handles normals when exporting or maybe it has to do with a large zscale in that it destroys normal interpolation or anything Below youll find an image of the inversed normals left and the correct normals right where the inversenormal object has a large zscale done via blender.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7shrx.png altincorrect and correct normalsp  phr strongeditstrongp  pI manually triangulated the cylinders in blender this time and validated their normals. The normals of all the cylinders are correct and then exported as they are. However, one pipe now has correct lighting, but the other pipes still have their normals inversed while they have the same triangulation as the working pipe, which is confusing. The following image shows the normals of the cylinders.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSblfW.png altNormals of pipes in blenderp  phr strongeditstrongp  pOk I figured something out. Once I started scaling the correctly lighted pipe to the exact same scale as the incorrect pipe left one then the normals of the correct pipe were inversed again inversed in my OpenGL program, in Blender the normals still look fine. So a scale in the length of the cylinders definitely has something to do with their normals getting inversed, although I dont know what that could be.p

Negative 3586 h2TLDRh2  pAs described in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma17245697834176this posta, I changed a TFS changeset comment. How can I get this to be reflected in the corresponding Git commit in my local Git repository, using GitTfsp  h2Verbose versionh2  pIm a GitTfs user. My workflow is such that I try to commit extremely small increments of code to my local Git repository one line changemdashtests greenmdashcommit sort of thing and push it up to the TFS server once I have a meaningful but hopefully still small changeset. Often this is after just one Git commit, but sometimes it is after several.p  pWhen checking several Git commits into TFS at once, GitTfs combines the Git commit messages as the default TFS checkin comment. So far so good. I usually tamper with them to make them a read more smoothly as a single changeset comment. But today I forgot to and checked in a message that would have been less than helpful to my TFSusing coworkers.p  pOkay, no big deal. I used TFS to edit the changeset comment to make it more coherent. However, I have not been able to get my local Git repository synced up with this change. This is not a big deal, because mainly I changed it for other people. However, I am curious to see if I can get it synced up.p  h2What Ive triedh2  pI tried this, but the commit message is still what it was before I edited the changeset commentp  precodegit reset hard HEAD git tfs pull codepre

Negative 3586 pWhen computing checkmate for a king in chess, do you determine the other players possible moves against your king Or do you consider merely their units reach If you say its the former, then there is a contradiction like this statement is false Consider this image with two kings a square apart and their knights protecting from above rooks. If we assume that the definition of possible moves must prevent check based on enemy possible moves, then the logic recursively alternates. p  blockquote   ol   liFirst, we say that our king is in check from the enemy knight so we are limited from moving our own knight because we must escape. li   liThen we realize that the knight does not have an available move into our kings square because he will be placing his king in check with our rook. He does not have our king in check after all.li   liThen we realize, free from check, that we are now able to move our own knight to the enemy king forcing him to move from check and preventing further his choices.li   liHowever, we notice that we cannot do this because it will place us in check with the enemy rook.li   liWe realize that since we cannot actually move our knight, the enemy king is not actually in check, therefore he is freely able to use his knight to attack our king.li   liGo to step 2 no matter how many times you have already.li   ol blockquote  pOkay, so maybe we assume that reach always counts regardless of the enemys check status. If our king is in reach of the enemy knights usual attack range, we consider it a check and must resolve it. Is this how the actual game is ruled though It seems an easy solution to the problem faced when programming the game logic, but Im not sure if it is correct or not.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1OcXq.png altBoth in check, or neitherp  pI did some thinking and came up with this analysis I think you have proven that the scenario of both kings being in check not necessarily the scenario of the board I showed cannot exist by contradiction. Only one player can make a move at a time. Therefore, one player makes the initial move which transitions from the state of no kings being in check to some kings being in check. According to the rules, this move is not allowed if that players king results is in a check. I will point out the significance of results soon This means that no matter how check is defined, he cannot make any move if his king meets that condition. Therefore, the only transition to checks from no checks is to the enemy being in check. The enemy must escape check, still following the rule of not entering check in one move. The remaining state would be game over or that king escaping check.p  pSo I understand that both kings being in check is not possible.  Now the board I showed is either reachable or not reachable.  Lets assume the board is reachable and see if there is a contradiction. Lets ambiguously assume its whites turn since the scenario is symmetric.  This means black just moved. Therefore, blacks king is not in check. The black king is only reachable by the white knight. Therefore, the white knight must be restricted by some rule to not attack the black king. The only two possible rules that can enforce that conclusion arep  blockquote   ol   liThe white knight is currently protecting his king from check.li   liThe white king is in check already and that move will not solve the check.li   ol blockquote  pFirst, assume 2 is true regardless of 1. The white king is in check and the only piece in attack range is black knight. The black knight cannot attack the square containing king, however, because it would place his own king in check. Therefore 1 must be true and the white king is not in check. So both kings are not in check. We reverse the game board to see if this is reachable. Assume the scenario with the following alterations White has a bishop 2 up and 1 right from the black rook. The black king is one square to the left. The white king is one square to the right. No kings are in range of any other pieces, so it may be reasonable to assume this initial state is reachable. The black knight is protecting his king from the bishop, so it cannot move to under the white knight. The white king moves left. Now the white knight is protecting the white king and cannot move to under the black knight. The black king moves right one square. Thus, the scenario is reachable. The only questioned assumption standing is that when any moves are considered, it is safe to assume that the check rules are computed. Thus, a king may come in range of a unit which may not attack it due to prevention of his own king being in check. If this assumption is not made, then the pieces simply could follow the rules of not allowing kings to enter the unrestricted attack range of an enemy unit. Now, it is interesting to see if this scenario is computable without infinite loops. For dependencies, I will use arrows. For the initial white king moving left, white king  black knight stopped  white bishop attack black king Those are single step computations, no loops in dependencies so far. For the black king to move right,  black king  white knight stopped  black rook attack white king Still no dependencies. What about when we now try to check white knights available moves including attacking the black king white knight stopped  black rook attack white king What about if the white rook attacks the black rook white rook stopped  black knight attack white king Whites remaining options are to move the king to the right or down.p  pOur conclusion,p  blockquote   ol   liMoving to this board state is possible without breaking the dont move into check rule.li   liThis board state obviously assumes that computing check depends on possible enemy moves, not their simple native attack ranges.li   liWhen this state is reached, both kings are not in check.li   liIt is at least possible that this is not a stalemate. Unknown if alwaysli   ol blockquote  pSo I finally found rules on wikipedia about placing another king in check even if it compromises ones own king. So, we cannot make our assumption in part 2, thus the board state is not reachable. A piece unable to move because it would place its own king in check it is pinned against its own king may still deliver check to the opposing player. Thus our final conclusion for the apparent actual rules of chess, the board state is not reachable as it follows the check rules.p  pI am going to choose icedtrees answer because of the valuable logic which follows the game rulesp  precodeif for every move for player X ignoring rules about king threats,  player Y can capture player Xs king next turn,  then player X is in checkmate. codepre  pHowever, I would fix them to be the followingp  precodeX is checkmate if and only if      For all legal movesmove according to rule definition X         There exists a generic movelegal move A ignoring rules of protecting king A Y such that            X king is captured               codepre

Negative 3586 pI am attempting to find a good way to appearance test a large Rails Application in order to regression test CSS.p  pstrongBackstorystrong   I have a very large rails app that is being worked on by approximately 100 developers. We currently have a framework in place that works with selenium to essentially take a screenshot of page and compare that screenshot against a golden master. This setup has multiple issues.p  ul liFirst he screenshots look different depending on what machine they are run on. li liBecause our automated tests run on a test server using team city, any time any front end change is made adding a button for example the tests automatically break and cannot be fixed until the automated tests have run and the new golden masters generated locally generated masters dont match those generated on the automated testing server. li liWith the additional overhead of blessing every little change, no matter how small, most developers simply ignore the tests.li ul  pstrongProposed Solutionstrong     What we would like to do is be able to run the test in such a way so that it just compares my code against the last commit. So rather than having a set of golden masters, that are constantly being updated manually have the ability to say take this commit as golden and compare it against this other commit. Specifically...p  ol liI check in revision 123 we are on git but I want to use sequential numbers for this to make sense. li liThe test checks out revision 122, runs the appearance test and generates a golden masterli liThe test checks out revision 123 my new code and runs the appearance test comparing it against the golden masters of the previous revision.li ol  pThere are a couple of ways that I could see this working. The most simple I think would be just a rake task that is supplied with 2 git hashes. One is your revision and one is the revision to compare it against. That way it can be run locally. I welcome any thoughts and insights. p

Negative 3586 pSo there is this issue with making sure the client is still available when doing a callback in WCF when using WSDualHttpBinding. Polling is an expensive and unreliable solution. It occurred to me that maybe a simple HTTP POST or GET to the clients address OperationContext.Current.Channel.RemoteAddress would at least tell you if the client was there. Youd still probably get a 400, bad request error, but so long as it wasnt a 404 or 503, you could probably assume that the client was still there. This still seems a bit kludgy, so I was wondering if anyone had any other ideas or could point out a serious flaw in the logic of checking the RemoteAddress before making the callback.p

Negative 3586 pIm writing a test system that uses, amongst other things, a data source. When running, it will read a bunch of instruments, but for testing and development of the back end, I want it to read a file, or return random numbers. In the future, I know that new data sources will need to be created whose operation is as yet unknown. I am trying to set the system up so that I can move on to a new department, and not have to come back and support it, so want to be as Pythonic and leave as few surpises as possible. A main requirement is to have a consistent API for the source, and ABC seems the obvious choice here. Theres not sufficient common between the sources to have any worthwhile chunk in a base class to be inherited from.p  pI dont want a large source module that selects what to do, I want small standalone sources that can be chosen from, so the old ones that work can be left alone. The question is, I want to be able to select which source to use with a parameter, so I can run the same test script and switch sources easily. I forget exactly how I came across codenewcode, but it wasnt obvious, and few other people had heard of it. It works. But is the obvious or Pythonic way to do what Im trying to do Is there a way of doing this that is more familiar to my colleagues I should point out that I am now working at slightly above my comfort level for metaprogramming, so anything more complicated will probably whoosh straight over my head.p  precodefrom abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod import random  class BaseSource     metaclass  ABCMeta      abstractmethod     def getself         pass      class ManualSrcBaseSource     def getself         return floatrawinputgimme a number    class RandomSrcBaseSource     def getself         return random.random  class SourceBaseSource     generic Source choice     def newBaseSource, choice         if choice  0             return ManualSrc         elif choice  1             return RandomSrc         else             raise ValueErrorsource choice parameter  not valid.formatchoice  if name  main     for usesrc in range4         print using source choice .formatusesrc         src  Sourceusesrc         print src.get codepre

Negative 3586 pIm having a problem with the screen recording in Android. Im looking for a way to record the screen. The approach Im looking for must fulfill the following requirementsp  pa It can have ROOT. I read a lot of the threads here and I think it should be easier with root. So this is no limiting factor for me. p  pb It should work on Tegra2 or Tegra3 devices such as the Nexus 7. Thus, frame buffering approaches will not give the expected result to me. p  pc It should be able to record the full screen in background using a service. So, it should not be limited to my own application.p  pd It should be run on the device only. So, no connecting to PC should be necessary. p  pWhat I tried so farp  p1 I tried to use the amazing new screen record feature of Android 4.4. So I gained root rights and executed the command from within my application. This works fine, but the approach has two problemsp  pi I did not find a way to stop the current recording.p  pii The recording is limited to 3 minutes. I need at least 10 minutes. p  p2 I implemented an approach which takes screenshots while the service is running and stores them in a folder on the sdcard. This is done by using the codesystembinscreencap pcode command. However, this approach is really slow. It only achieves to make a screenshot every second, such I only would get an FPS rate of 1. However, my goal is not to achieve an FPS rate of 30. 68 FPS would be sufficient. Moreover, I did not find a way to encode the .png files as a video. p  pOn the APP store I found an application SCR Screen Recorder which is able to do exactly the thing Im looking for. So, I think it is possible. However, my app should be able to do it without requiring additional apps. Thus, an Intent is no option for me.p  pBest regards, misterviperp  pstrongUPDATE 1strong So Im now able to start and stop the screenrecording for Android 4.4 programatically. Here it is important to not KILL the screenrecord process using the standard kill command. You have to use the codekill SIGINT ltpidgtcode command  otherwise you get and coruppted video file. The PID of the screen record process can be get by calling codeps screenrecordcode and then doing some processing on the resulting string. Now I only need an approach for merging all the video files programmatically. p  pstrongUPDATE 2strong Finally, I also managed the last part. First, I use a Timer and a TimerTask which allow me to start a new screenrecording every 3 minutes until the user hits stop. Using the solution described in Update1, I them stop the recording. After doing the complete recording I start a postprocessing step. In this step I use the mp4parser library to merge the video files into a single one. The answer for that was also available here on stackoverflow a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13514317howtoconcatormergetwoormorevideofilesinandroidclicka.p  pThank you all for your answers. Under the requirements of root access and Android 4.4 I now have a running screenrecording. For my purposes this is fine. However, I think there are enough developers which have other requirements. So feel free to answer here, if you have further ideas.   p

For instance, I grouped all the Userrelated requestsresponse messages, all the commentrelated  messages, and all the surveyrelated messages its for a simple survey app.p  pThe thing is what is the best possible way to segment the endpoint API while keeping it simple in order to avoid having ONE huge file with too many requests in the same coderemote.Servicecode class.p  pCan I make several coderemote.Servicecode classes and then distribute them over several modules and then include them all in a single module Like this p  precodeendpoints.apinamehelloworld, versionv1 class UsersApiremote.Service     Users API v1.     some endpoints methods, all with the users path  class CommentsApiremote.Service     Comments API v1.     some endpoints methods, all with the comments path  class SurveysApiremote.Service     Surveys API v1.     some endpoints methods, all with the surveys path   APPLICATION  endpoints.apiserver[UsersApi, CommentsApi, SurveysApi] codepre  pOr should I use the routing given in the app.yaml file to route requests Are those two solutions even possible Are they even the bestp  pIf you can come up with any better way to achieve this than my propositions, go ahead tell me more about it. I can provide with some code example of my suggestions if those are unclear. Thanks in advance for any help.p

Negative 3586 pI am really stuck on a following problem. I am not begginer with drupal, but I am beginner with drupal commerce, I have used Ubercart since this project. p  pActually, If I create product display, and then a few variations under this product, drupal commerce automatically creates select box with titles of the other variations. This is quite useful for almost all the eshops, but not for this one. I need to replace select box with titles with just images, on which customer will be able to click on, and select variation type just by image.p  pI think that there is almost all the functionality in drupal commerce kickstart which I am using right now. But I do not know how to achieve the result. I have already tried editing product view, but was not able to make it working. I have also searched through core modules of drupal commerce in code, because I think that there should be just an array function with result of titles, but did not found something like this yet. I have searched whole internet to search for solution but did not found anything useful.p  pIn some threads peoples use to solve similar problems with for example colors, to give an ability for customer to see the color squares instead of color select box, this is achieved by module, which some of devs written. Maybe I can edit this module p  pAlso, I have never ever created a module, I am a bit lost in drupal codes, but tried it before.p  pHere are the attachments for better visionp  pa hrefhttpofca.sktempprintscreen.png relnofollowhttpofca.sktempprintscreen.pnga,p  pa hrefhttpofca.sktempresult.png relnofollowhttpofca.sktempresult.pngap  pAny advice will be greatly appreciated, I just need to be pointed to the right direction,p

Negative 3586 pI am trying to add the translation to a simple example of drawing a triangle using OpenGL ES 2.0 for Android. I have created translation matrix with 0 translation in all directions which should be the identity matrix. When I remove the multiplication from vertex shader triangle renders fine.

Negative 3586 pUsing Sublime Text 3 Build 3059 on Linux.p  pIn Sublime Text column selection can be used to select a rectangular area of a file. When using the mouse to do this different mouse buttons are used on each platform. On both OS X and Windows the middle mouse button can be used to select the rectangle of text. On Linux you need to use the right mouse button  shift, I find that combination inconvenient so instead wanted to use the 4th button on my mouse to do it without the hassle of a modifier key.p  pEasy enough I just need to change the column selection mouse mapping in my default mousemap file.p  pHere are the relevant sections of the 3 Linux, OS X, and Windows default mousemap filesp  precode Column select Linux default mousemap file      button button2, modifiers [shift],     presscommand dragselect,     pressargs by columns ,   Column select is the same in the default OS X and Windows mousemap files      button button3,     presscommand dragselect,     pressargs by columns , codepre  pSo I figured all I needed to do is to use the same code as OS X and Windows but to set button4 instead of button3.

Negative 3586 pI am in developer network and the JBoss to be monitored using JVisualVM is behind client firewall in separate network. JBoss is exposed to us through a NAT. The exposed JMX port works when using telnet from our developer network, but JVisualVM still doesnt find the remote JMX. Apparently this can be due to two things 1 one or several dynamic RMI sockets need to be accessed, or 2 the java.rmi.server.hostname is not defined. My problem may be both points 1 and 2, but apparently since we have SSH access this can be tackled according to this sitep  precodehttprafaelsteil.comsettingupjmxforjconsolevisualvmonec2plusjettyconfiguration codepre  pjava.rmi.server.hostname is the public hostname like example.com of your server, without HTTP or anything else. You cannot use an internal address, otherwise you wont be able to remotely access the service.p  pHowever I have one question about the java.rmi.server.hostname, should the defined IP address be the server internal IP or NAT IP which is publicly expoed to our developer networkp

If the service is defined in the current solution, try building the solution and adding the service reference again. codepre  pThe first step I tried was to contact the company offering the service and ask if they could help, but they do not use Visual Studio, so they were of no help trying to add a Visual Studio service.p  pI then began to look around to see if there were other ways to possibly add the service from what I was given. I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4304281createwebserviceproxyinvisualstudiofromawsdlfile14360303thisa question, which is similar, but not exactly the same. There are several other questions regarding WSDL files and adding services to Visual Studio, but none of them have helped me. p  pWhen I try adding the service using a local path to the downloaded WSDL file, as is suggested in the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma143603033897302answer receiving the bountya for the question above, it still does not work albeit with a different error. p  precodeThe document at the url fileCUsersisellarDownloadswebservicesPrimus.wsdl was not recognized as a known document type. The error message from each known type may help you fix the problem   Report from WSDL Document is There is an error in XML document 364, 19..  The element was not expected in this context ltxsdanotation xmlnsxsdhttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemagt..ltxsdanotationgt. Expected elements httpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemaannotation. If the service is defined in the current solution, try building the solution and adding the service reference again. codepre  pIt references what I assume to be a line number although I am not particularly familiar with the output of WSDL Document whatever that is. Neither line 364 nor line 19 of the file has an codeltxsdanotationgtcode element though.p  pI also tried running the file through WSDL.exe as another answer from the above question suggests. With that I got a similar error to the one I received from Visual Studio. I assume Visual Studio just uses the WSDL.exe to process WSDL files since the outputs were almost identical and WSDL.exe is found under Visual Studio in Program Files.p  pWhen I attempt to add the service as a Web Reference I get the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6lrSi.png altPrimus Service as Web Reference Errorp  pAs you can see it correctly grabs the method signatures from the WSDL but claims to have failed with a 404 and not found anything for a different metadata file. p  pI decided to see if the service was even active using a hrefhttpwww.soapui.org relnofollowSoapUIa to connect to the service and it worked without any problems.p  pI am hoping that there is an easy way to fix the WSDL file so Visual Studio can simply import the service to my project as I have done with the other services. p  hr  pstrongImportant Editstrongp  pI have gotten the WSDL to import by changing the line in the Definitions element from what it is above to codexmlnsxsdhttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemaannotationcode by simply adding annotation to the end. p  pThis caused the WSDL to import, but with no generated code in the Reference.cs, I feel so very close to solving this, but yet so far away. I am still hoping that there is a simple change where I can get the WSDL to create a service reference correctly and the Reference code to generate for me as I spent a while already trying to write the code myself in the file without realizing that it would all be erased when Visual Studio tried to incorrectly regenerate the code.p  hr  pstrongAttempting to run modified WSDL through SVCUtil.exestrongp  pI attempted first to run the WSDL through svcutil per Leandros answer since I did not have access to an SVC file for the service. The first run received the same error message as the second code box above. I tried also to run with the modified WSDL that initially imported, but did not generate code from just above. This gave me the below error.p  precodeError Cannot import wsdlportType Detail An exception was thrown while running a WSDL import extension System.ServiceModel.Description.DataContractSerializerMessageContractImporter Error Schema with target namespace httpapi.shipprimus.com could not be found.

Negative 3586 pI am using BlueJ with Karel the Robot.p  pThe program is called SmarterSorter, and here are the instructions I need a bit of help with the program over all, not just with the NullPointerException.p  pBackground there are an unknown number of vertical piles of beepers no gaps  each vertical pile has an unknown number of beepers in it one beeper per corner  no gaps. The bottom beeper of the leftmost pile is always at the origin.p  pIm intentionally not giving you the algorithm in bullet form so you cant just turn the bullets into methods. Im pretending Im an enduser i.e., a quasiintellect in terms of computer programming  so, Im going to describe the problem in English.p  pSo, heres the algorithmp  pThe SmarterSorterRobotSSR does the sorting. She, however, has some helpers delegates  the PutterRobotPUR and the PickerRobotPIR. The SSR knows that she always starts off facing East and is standing on the bottommost beeper in the leftmost vertical pile. She begins by walking along the bottom row of all the vertical piles and stopping when she reaches an empty corner. Then, she creates all those PIRs and then, after they are all created, commands each one in turn to pick up all of the beepers in their respective pileso, for example, if the PIR in the first vertical pile had 5 beepers above him, he would be standing 6 corners above where he was, having picked up 6 beepers. SSR should now query each PIR for the number of beepers it picked up and she should store those counts as she gets them into a java array of ints. She should then sort that array see API for Arrays. She should now, working left to right again, create a PUR at the bottom of the first soontobecreated pile of beepers  the PUR should know how many beepers it is about to putthe smallest number from the recently sorted array. The PUR should then put all the beepers and go HOME described below in the most efficient manner possible. The SSR should now create a second PUR and have it do the same  continue until all piles have been placed i.e., all piles are now in sorted nondescending order and all the PURs are at HOME position. The SSR should now ask each PIR to go HOME. And, finally, the SSR should now go HOME.p  pHOME home is the corner directly North of the topmost beeper in the leftmost vertical column.p  pAnd here is my codep  precodeimport java.util.Arrays public class SmarterSorterRobot extends GoHomeBot      public SmarterSorterRobotint av, int st, Direction dir, int beeps              superav, st, dir, beeps           public int x 1     private PickerRobot [] robot     private PutterRobot [] bot     private int numBeeps     private int [] myPutterRobots     private int [] numBeepers      public int getNumBeeps              return numBeeps                                                                                                                                                                    public void sortBeepers              turnRight         countNumberOfRows         robot  new PickerRobot [x]         createPickerRobots         pickLotsOfBeepers         transferToBeepers         sortTheBeepersnumBeepers         robot [x].goHome         this.goHome           public void countNumberOfRows              whilenextToABeeper                      move             x                    public void createPickerRobots              for int i1iltrobot.lengthi                      robot [i] new PickerRobot 1,i,North,0                    public void pickBeepers              whilenextToABeeper                      pickBeeper             move             numBeeps                    public void pickLotsOfBeepers              for int i1 iltrobot.length i                      robot [i].pickBeepers                    public int[] transferToBeepers              int [] numBeepers  new int [x]         for int i0 iltnumBeepers.lengthi                      numBeepers [i]                    Arrays.sort numBeepers         return numBeepers           public void sortTheBeepersint [] numBeepers              for int i0 iltnumBeepers.length i                      PutterRobot robespierre  new PutterRobot 1, i, North, numBeepers [i]             whileanyBeepersInBeeperBag                              putBeeper                          goHome                     codepre  pI get a NullPointerException on the first line of the sortTheBeepers method.p  pI cannot figure out why.p  pThank you for your helpp

Negative 3586 pMy app uses an Azure Notification Hub to send messages to both Windows Phone and iOS devices. The problem is that they work if one is called, but it doesnt work if both are called.p  pFor example, If I send a message to an iOS device from my iOS emulator, the following code works fine and the notification appears.p  precodevar toast  PrepareMpnsToastPayloadmyapp, notificationText var appleToast  PrepareAppleToastPayloadmyapp, notificationText  await NotificationHelper.Instance.Hub.SendMpnsNativeNotificationAsynctoast, userTag await NotificationHelper.Instance.Hub.SendAppleNativeNotificationAsyncappleToast, userTag codepre  pHowever, if I uncomment the SendMpns.. line, the notification never gets to the apple device.  When stepping through this code with remote debugging, the call to SendMpns.. doesnt seem to return. I step over it and it just resumes.. and the breakpoint on the SendApple.. call below it never gets hit.p  pThis works the same with the Windows Phone Mpns line works fine without the apple call.p  pHow am I supposed to send an alert to a user when I dont know what device they are on I just want to send the notification to all types. Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.p  pEDIT  The below answers of removing await did work. However as I now have authenticated notification hub I need to capture the return value of the call so I can see if I need to get another auth token if it has expiredp

I would also like to add the option for the user to have this file which updates daily to be able to send to them automatically every weekmonth, so they wont have to think about it. The user can set the intervals themselves.p  pIs this possible The user will set up this option themselves from a menu, so its not like they wont know its happening. Every automatic mail will also contain information on how to turn the option back off again.p  pIs this possible and is it allowed by Applep  pThanks for your replyp

Consider a piece of code below for examplep  precodechannels   Channelsmodelgtcache0gtfindAllarrayorder gt channelname codepre  pThis statement is supposed to make in entry in the cache and it is doing, but it is not fetching the data from cache, rather it is directly going to DB for the result.p  pWhile, if I provide a expire time  0 zero, then it works smoothly. For examplep  precode    channels   Channelsmodelgtcache20gtfindAllarrayorder gt channelname codepre  pworks perfectly for 20 seconds and fetch the results from cache.p  pWe are confirmed about it as we enabled the log and saw the profiling.p  pInfinite expire time works also fine for caching keyvalue pair using codeYiiappgtcachegtsetcode or codeYiiappgtcachegtgetcodep  pAny idea if im doing anything wrong p  pthanks.p
Negative 3586 pin out project, currently we are dealing with XML with JAXB and Json with Jersey json jaxb context. now i wanted to migrate above implementation to portable across rest implementation like jersey and resteaey etc., we plan to use moxy for this. currently all our jaxb classes annotated XmlRootElement alone other than we dont have any other jaxb annotated on those classes. and some of the classes will be participate as the element of some XmlRootElement annotated class, we have not annotated any jaxn specific annotation to those classes.p  pthe same classes we tried with moxy implementation with the help of a hrefhttpblog.bdoughan.com relnofollowhttpblog.bdoughan.coma blog for jaxb and json. we are facing the issue. like below is one of the error Internal Exception javax.json.stream.JsonParsingException Invalid token EOF at line no1, column no1, offset0, Expected Tokens [CURLYOPEN, SQUAREOPEN]]p  pnow my question is,  1 how it will handle Collection like List, Set, Map,, which will not marked any jaxb specific annotationthese are the class can be element of some root class. 2 how we have to handle for Enum type 2 we have to annotate each element with corresponding jaxb annotation. 3 is there any thing we can achieve using plugin jaxb xjc compiler for moxy.p  pPlease guide me the right direction to achieve this.p  pnow i wanted to do know, is there make minimal changes to achieve or create some plugin will generate schema take care of above issuep

Negative 3586 pUsing the xeditable libraries, were attempting to fetch a set of names from typeahead.  The return values for the agency should include items such as the name, city and the particular SQLID in the database.  We nearly have the solution here, however, whenever the agent is selected, it looks like the formatting displays the id key in the field  thus confusing the viewer.  If an agency such as Ad Agency is selected, upon section, an id such as 14 may appear in the field.  We were hoping to select upon the name attribute, but submit the ID field for that entry in the field.p  pThe code we have so far is as follows p  precodeagency.editable   placement bottom,   title Enter an assignee,   model agency,   url  receiverorg.dataurl,   display functionvalue      this.htmlvalue   ,   success functionresponse, newValue      console.logresponse.status     ifresponse.success return response.message   ,   error functionresponse, newValue      ifresponse.status  500          return Service unavailable.

We will display the name  city in the typeahead, but really only want to submit the EXACT record that were looking for example id 6.p  pFrom using the Chrome network debugger, I can clearly see that typeahead is returning the full object for the agencyp  precode0 id 14, name MohrCrona Group, city Monafurt, city Monafurt id 14 name MohrCrona Group codepre  pand by my templates code, I can see that I can access the ID field, however upon clicking on a name, the templates file turns the returned name into a field  thus confusing the end user.p  pThere must be a simple callback function in between to catch the name and turn it into the field, but xeditable doesnt seem to cleanly pass all the parameters as is.p  pAny ideas on how to get the NAME to stay displayed, but submit the ID associated with that record would be sincerely appreciated.p

I have to make sure that the HTML to PDF converter will run on a 64 bit worker role.p  pSince Pechkin cant run as a 64bit application I have decided to use Tuespechkin, because they should be very alike and both use wkhtmltopdf to convert the HTML to PDF.p  pNow, i got this all set up but the resulting PDF is kind of disappointing.p  pProblemsp  ol lipThe font is rendered differently. With Pechkin the font is always sharp  where tuespechkin makes it very bold.

Negative 3586 pI am testing an android form xamarin.br My script looks for a radioButton with a label Registered It finds and performs action on this However there is another instance of a radioButton labelled Registered which is several lines below the 1st instance.  The cucumber script is always finding the first one only, therefore the script fails.p  pI need to perform actions on both buttons not just the first instance.  p  pWhen I do a queryRadioButton it returns just the one radio button, as on the form the C code is simply instantiating another instance of the one radioButton.

Negative 3586 pI am trying to write an application that can select all text in the textbox within an external application, copy it to the clipboard, perform changes programmatically to the string and then send the modified string back to the external application. I did not write the external application and do not have access to its code nor can I afford to contact the developer and have them make changes. The external application is ClientServer based and I can only interact with the user interface on the client side.p  pThe problem I am running into is that I can easily send keyboard commands to the application to send or delete text, but I cannot select all of the text. Using keyboard shortcuts CtrlA, CtrlShiftHome, CtrlShiftEnd, etc. do not work. Triple clicking on the text box does not work either.p  pHowever, I can right click on the text box and bring up a context menu and then select the command Select All.

Negative 3586 pIm kinda struggling with the Apache commonscli v1.3 and I havent found a practical solution to the following problem yetp  pI have a command line tool that  depending on the specified parameters  creates a String or reads it from a local file, possible edits it inline, and optionally displays, writes said String to a local file or sends it via an HTTP request to a server.p  pSo I have the options c for create, r for read, e for edit via the cli, d for display, w for write, and p for push to serverp  pObviously some combinations are possible. E.g. it should be possible to create this String and push it without reading or writing it fromto a file. Also, it should be possible to create and write without pushing, and so on...p  pSo the semantics of the parameters arep  precodec OR r [e] [d w p] codepre  pObviously, when the String is created, it must not be read. When creating, id use interactive input from a cliparser. When reading, I want to allow the user to edit via interactive input from the cli. The rest of the parameters are kinda optional.p  pNext When reading, a filenamepath needs to be specified. Also, when writing, this is necessary. Anyhow, it should be possible to specify a file to read from and a SECOND file to write to. So there would be two arguments for filenames, which are both optional.p  pThe resulting syntax would look like thisp  precodetool cp tool rp filenametoread tool rdwp filenametoread filenametowrite tool cw filenametowrite codepre  pand so on.p  pIm a bit lost here. How to I configure commonscli to have two arguments for filenames, which are required based on the parameters options specified Is this even possiblep

Negative 3586 pI am passing some XML to a RESTful web servicep  precodeltrootgt     ltelement1gt         ltelement2gt     ltelement3gt ltrootgt codepre  pThe web service will unmarshal this XML, and I want to ensure that the XML is valid. p  pI used a schema to create the Java objects, and in this schema codeelement1code has a codemaxOccurs1code attribute but this has no effect on the Java objects that are created unlike, for example, adding codeminOccurs1code which will result in coderequiredtruecode being added to the codeXMLElementcode annotation. When unmarshalling the XML that is passed the web service, if an element that should appear only once appears multiple times, the last instance of the element will be parsed. I do not want this to happen, as I want to be able to alert the client that the XML they sent is not valid and that they should remove whatever element does not apply  not just arbitrarily accept the last element. I believe this will involve a little prevalidation before unmarshalling  and I may be able to make use of the beforeUnmarshal method.p  pAfter doing a bit of research, it is my understanding that there is no JAXB annotation that will allow me to specify that codeelement1code can exist only once. Is this the case Is it possible to validate this at all without a schema p
