Positive 75657 pIm currently learning about Embers new datadown, actionsup paradigm for components. As discussed a hrefhttpemberjs.comblog20150510runuptotwooh.html relnofollowherea, however, sometimes I want to allow the child component to modify the property explicitly. This is where the emmutem helper comes in it creates a wrapper for the passed in value, containing a readonly value and a function to update it. The example on that page is for a simple button which increments a counter.p  pHow does this concept work if Im using the input helper inside a component For example, lets say Im building a form which consists of a bunch of special form componentsp  precode templatesindex.hbs ltformgt     formcontrol valuemut model.firstValue     formcontrol valuemut model.secondValue ltformgt codepre  pIf the emformcontrolem component just has the task of wrapping the input control, how do we use the passedin emmutem object correctly Is it something likep  precode templatescomponentsformcontrol.hbs input typetext valueattrs.value.value inputattrs.value.update codepre  pMy thinking here the value of the input element is set to the value of the emmutem object, and whenever the input value changes HTML5 input event the update method of the emmutem object is called to set the model property to the new value. It seems theres something wrong with my thinking though, because this doesnt work. What is the standard way of doing this now Im using Ember 1.13.8.p
Positive 75657 pIm using the standard ActiveModelAdapter in my Ember app to do most of my queries to work with Ember model object.p  pIn one case, however, I want to make a arbitrary REST request to get back JSON to populate a chart not backed by a model but I want to go through the ActiveModelAdapter so the correct host values are used.p  pHeres whats not workingp  precodeupdateChartFromIndustry function    Ember..ajax     context this,     method get,     url apiv3chartsallrisk.json,     dataType json,     data  ind this.getind    .thenfunctionjson        Ember.riskdaysdata.highchartsjson     ,     functionerrs        console.logerrs         .observesind, codepre  pIn development, that query goes to localhost4200 the ember server rather than the rails backend at localhost3000.

Positive 75657 pIn my application I have common header that outlets into the main application layout. In that header you can select a site. I need that site selection to update another template that is rendered in the application layout. Having struggled with this for a few days I think the correct way to solve this is to use a shared service, to have the header controller observe the site selection and set that value in the shared service, then to have the index controller use a Ember.computed.alias on the value in the service controller. The following is an example of my codep  pcontrollersheader.jsp  precodeimport Ember from ember  export default Ember.Controller.extend   sessionService Ember.inject.service,    currentSiteChanged Ember.observersession.currentsite, function     var currentsite  this.getsession.currentsite     console.logcurrentSiteObserver, currentsite     this.getsessionService.setcurrentSite, currentsite   ,   codepre  pcontrollersindex.jsp  precodeimport Ember from ember  export default Ember.Controller.extend   sessionService Ember.inject.service,   currentSite Ember.computed.aliassessionService.currentSite,   dashboardData function     var currentSite  this.getcurrentSite     console.login dashboardData, currentSite     other code that uses the currentSite   .propertycurrentSite,  codepre  pservicessessionservice.jsp  precodeimport Ember from ember  export default Ember.Service.extend   currentSite null,    setCurrentSite function     var currentSite  this.getsession.currentsite     this.setcurrentSite, currentSite    .oninit,  codepre  pI think this should allow someone to select a site in the header and have the dashboardData property in index update to use that selection. When the page initially loads the header defaults to the first site and the index renders it has the correct site value that it must have gotten from the sessionservice, however if you select another site the index does not get updated. Via the console.logs and debugging I can see that the header is observing the change and setting the value on the sessionservice.p  pAdditionally I have tried solving this other ways injecting the header service into the index and observing a property, injecting the index in the header and directly setting the value, sending and listening to events,etc but I am willing to try anything or to be corrected that this isnt the correct way to solve the problem.p  pI am using ember 1.13.8 and moving to 2 isnt an option at the moment.p

A and other heuristic graph traversal algorithms are great for low dimensional problems.

Negative 75657 pIm working on a legacy project, written for the most part in Delphi 5 before it was upgraded to Delphi 2007. A lot has changed after this upgrade, except the database thats underneath. It still uses MSAccess for data storage.p  pNow we want to support SQL Server as an alternate database. Still just for singleuser situations, although multiuser support will be a feature for the future. And although there wont be many migration problems see below when it needs to use a different database, keeping two database structures synchronized is a bit of a problem.p  pIf I would create an SQL script to generate the SQL Server database then I would need a second script to keep the Access database uptodate too. They dont speak the same dialect. At least, not for our purposes. So I need a way to maintain the database structure in a simple way, making sure it can generate both a valid SQL Server database as an Access database. I could write my own tool where I store the database structure inside an XML file, which combined with some smart code and ADOX would generate both database types.p  pstrongBut isnt there already a good tool that can do thisstrongp  phrp  pNote the application also uses ADO and all queries are just simple select statements. Although it has 50 tables, theres one root Document table and the user selects one of the documents in this table. It then collects all records from all tables that are related to this document record and stores them in an inmemory structure. When the user saves the data, it just writes the document record and all changed data back to the database again. Basically, this readwrite mechanism of documents is the only database interaction in the whole application. So using a different database is not a big problem.p  pWe will drop the MSAccess database in the future but for now we have 4000 customers using this application. We first need to make sure the whole thing works with SQL Server and we need to continue to maintain the current code. As a result, we will have to support both databases for at least a year.p

Negative 75657 pBeen developing a game for a while, and currently re working the GUI, or at least trying to. Had the massive problem of not being able to resize the frame without issues, as I didnt understand layout managers very well. A few projects later, and time to come back and do some more on the game, and I hit a problem...p  pThe basic layout of the main frame is, mainPane, containing one gameScrollPane and one controlPanel. The scroll pane is a scroll pane, and the control panel a normal panel. The scroll pane contains the main game panel.p  pAs I wanted the scroll pane to take up most of the screen, with the control panel taking up a small lower area, much the same as many Sim like games, so chose the Border layout for the mainPane. I added the scroll pane and set the constraints CENTER and the control panel added and constriants SOUTH. This didnt show the scroll pane, so I played around trying different constraints, and it seems that only when I set the scroll pane constraint to North, does it display at all.p  pTo demonstrate this, I have created a quick video... a hrefhttpscreenjel.lyq5RjczwZjH8 relnofollowhttpscreenjel.lyq5RjczwZjH8ap  pAs you can see, when I change the value of NORTH to CENTER and re run, its like its not therep  pBonus points for anyone who can see a clear second problem which I may start another question for after this issue is solvedp  pI thank you for your time to read this.p  pThanks in advance for any ideas or thoughts p  pRelp

Negative 75657 pAs an exercise and in an effort to better understandhelp other people better understand the build process at my company, I am hoping to create a directed acyclic graph of the build process. p  pThe current build process at my work is, as I understand, is essentially running nmake on a makefil at the root build directory. This makefile that specifies a list of components to build and for each component the build script recurses to build subcomponents, subsubcomponents, etc. Certain components are built into DLLLibs which can be used for linking against when building other components, this relationship would be a dependency. I.e. if component B links against the lib file of component A, component A is a dependency of component B.p  pWhat Im looking for is example code of how this would be done as Im still learning about programming.

Negative 75657 pSwing provides the basic building blocks for any GUI application but what about a higher level take on building GUI applicationsp  pIm not asking about the many arbitrary libraries that provide yet more wizzy variants on various visual components.p  pIm talking about the missing pieces that emeveryoneem ends up building themselves whenever they create anything other than a trivial GUI application.p  pI.e. the framework that the application specific logic builds on.p  pE.g. handling data binding, application lifecycle issues or supporting common things like building forms.p  pIf we were talking about persistence you could say that anyone can code up their own persistence layer using the javax.sql or java.io classes  however most people would rather use something like Hibernate.p  pSo, just as someone asking about persistence libraries probably isnt looking for variants on ObjectOutputStream, I am not looking for variants on some JComponent subclass or other.p  pI think this is a fair Stackoverflow question as, unlike areas like persistence, a clear consensus on the answer is not easy to determine using Google.p  pRather than a grab bag of random libraries perhaps people could answer in terms of what GUI issues are not immediately addressed by Swing and what libraries they feel best fill these gapp  pI asked a similar a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4798944essentialswinglibrariesjgoodiesjfreechartquestiona to this last week and it was closed  Ive tried to phrase this such that this wont also be closed.

Negative 75657 pThis is in part a followup to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5601730tddshouldprivateprotectedmethodsbeunderunittestthis questiona.p  pIm not sure the best way to ask this, so Ill try a short story to set the scenep  pOnce upon a time, there was a class A, which had a unit test class ATests responsible for testing its behaviour through the public interface.  They lived happily together for a while and then a change happened, and class B came along, which as it turned out had a lot in common with class A, so a base class was introduced.  p  pThe public behaviour of the base class is already covered by the tests for class A. So, the question is what happens nextp  p   Does class B need to have tests for the common base class behaviour  It seems like the behaviour is a part of B, so it should be tested, but should these tests be shared with those for class A  For the base class  If so, whats the best way to sharep  p   Does the new base class need unit tests, or is it ok for base classes to be tested through the tests of their children  Does it matter if the base class is abstractp  p   Is it enough to ensure that classes A amp B derive from the base class and trust the unit tests for the base class to test the common behaviour so the tests dont need to be replicated in the child classes  The tests for A amp B only need to test theyre newchanged behaviourp  p   Am I following totally the wrong approach having approximately one unit test class per real classp  pIve taken different views at different times and the different approaches can have quite an impact on the ability to refactor the code, time taken to write tests etc.  What approaches have people found works bestp

Negative 75657 pIm currently in the early stages of a project and have difficulty deciding which framework to use. I hear people say WPF is dead, yet it seems to be the only way to program a Microsoft Surface app. This is one of the possible future aims of the project, but not the main focus.p  pThe main focus however is both 2d and 3d objects in the same view and kinectvoice support. Some of the 2d objects are SVG files. From what I have read online so far its not easy to render SVG graphics in XNA nor Silverlight 5 3D for that matter. Ive seen some SVG to XAML converters, but could the result of this be used in a 3d view Or vice versap  pConsidering its not going to be a game, but a business application Im tempted to rule out XNA, but then again I also require good performance as there will be quite some graphical stuff going on and if possible support for high resolutionsvideo wall. Taking a video wall into consideration would maybe rule out WPF as Ive read that it will only use hardware acceleration if the resolution is lower than the texture size limit of the GPU.p  pThere is no intend to run the application in the browser or phone, as such im tempted to rule out Silverlight 5.p  pAny tips would be greatly be appreciated.

Negative 75657 pOk this might seems a bad idea or an obvious one. But lets imagine a CMS like PHPBB. And lets imagine youd build one. Id create just 1 file called PHPBB.install.php and running it it will create all folders and files needed with PHP. I mean, the user run it just once and every file and folder of the app is created via the PHP file.p  pstrongWhy to do thisstrongp  pWell mostly because its cleaner and you are pretty much sure it creates everything as you wish obliviously checking everything about the server first. Also, having all the files backedup inside a file you would be able to restore it very easily by deleting everything and reinstalling it running again PHPBB.install.php. Backingup files like this will allow you to also prevent errors How When an error occurred in a file, this file is restored as it was and automatically rerun.p  pstrongIt would be too heavystrongp  pThe installation would happen only once and youd be sure the user will not forget to place the files correctly. The errorpreventing will worth the cause and it would also happen only once.p  pNow the questionsp  ol lipDoes this technique exists If so, Whats its namepli lipWhy would you discourage itpli ol

Negative 75657 pFirst post  hope Im doing it rightp  pI have a file, lexicon.plist, containing an array of about 250K words.  I want to load all words of length n into an NSArray.p  pI know about the NSArray instance methodp  ul liidinitWithContentsOfFileNSString aPathli ul  pbut I dont see any way to intervene in the process of reading the file into the NSArray.  The only solution I can see is to first load the entire lexicon into one NSArray, and then run through it in a loop selecting the elements of length n.p  pIm very new at Cocoa, but I have come across some methods that perform some sort of iterative task, that accept a block of code that is invoked at each iteration.  I was wondering if such a functional variant of initWithContentsOfFile might exist, or how else I might iteratively read an array from a .plist file and filter the elements Im interested in.p  p[And if youre wondering if this might be a case of premature optimization  it is   But Id still like to know.]p

Negative 75657 pI think I have a bug in my program. I use SDL and OpenGL to render an animation. The program also measures the average FPS. Tipically, when I run the program, it will run at around 550 FPS. p  pHowever, if I start a second instance of the program, the FPS drops for both at around half 220 FPS. The strange thing is that if I close the first instance, the second one will still run at only 220 FPS. This leads me to believe that my cleanup code is somehow flawed. p  pSometimes, even if I run a single instance, it will run at only 220 FPS, probably due to a previous instance that failed to clean up properly.

Negative 75657 pIm a little new at programming okay, very new, and I came across Extended Backus Naur Form, or EBNF, and decided to try to figure out how to use it. Unfortunately, even though their are tons of explanations online on how EBNF works, there is precious little on how to actually implement it. So I made a simple little program in C using it, just to see what happens. Here is what I wrotep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt   mixture  [letterdigit] letter  digit integer  [ ] digit digit naturalNumber  digit digit digit  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 letter  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m     n  o  p  q  r  s  t  u  v  w  x  y  z  A  B  C  D E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M  N  O  P  Q  R  S  T  U  V  W  X Y  Z   int main      char c[7]     c[0]  1     c[1]  2     c[2]  3     c[3]  x     c[4]  y     c[5]  z     c[6]  0      ifc  mixture         printfYou have a mixture of numbers and letters          else ifc  integer         printfThis is just a number          else ifc  naturalNumber         printfThis is just a positive number          else ifc  digit         printfThis is a plain digit          else ifc  letter         printfThis is a plain letter           return 0  codepre  pRight away I get a compiler error Im using Code Blocks saying it expects a  before the , but I used a  because everything I read online seems to suggest a  is correct. Also, if I change it to  I get a compiler error that says mixture and others doesnt have a type or storage class. Well, int in front wont work, and char doesnt make sense either, since its a mixture of both.p  pIm also not sure if the declarations are supposed to go before main or inside of it. I ended up putting it before because one thing I read online seemed to suggest this was right. p  pBy the way, Im finding absolutely no online examples in C to follow  does this mean Im totally thinking about EBNF the wrong way and it cant be used like this at allp  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 75657 pI am loading javascript files asynchronously in my Java EE web application using a servlet.p  pThe bjsb files are placed under bWEBINFjsb folder.p  pThe process flow goes as followingp  pin bindex.jspb p  precodeltscript srcservletmainLoader.jsgt codepre  pthe bservletb does the neccessary job to get the bjsb file from inside bWEBINFjs b.p  pSo basically i call bone main jsb file bmainLoader.jsb which itself loads the rest of the js files in my application. The reason behind this architecture, is to hide some critical info in the bjsb files, so users wont be able to surf the files path and check the source code.brp  pI have two questionsbr  Is this considered a bad practicebr  Currently i am developing my app blocally localhostb , will this bjsb loading system cause problems when i move to production mode i mean will a remote user be able to donwload the js files while not being on localhostp  pbANSWERbbr bBalusCb made me realize where was the mistake in my choice. I didnt realize that this kind of JS fetching only works with a GET request. I thought it would work with a POST and thus disable the GET method on the servlet so that the JS cannot be accessed directly from the url bar.br p  pIn addition , what bDavidb said is true, however i was trying to make it not very straightforward to read the JS source.p  pSo i found that bTodd Chaffeeb is absolutely right, lesson learned brb1 Security through obscurity is a documented bad practice.bp

The ASP.NET markup for the buttons is pretty simple, and looks likep  precodeltaspLinkButton IDbutUpdate runatserver TextUpdate     CommandNameUpdate  gt ltaspLinkButton IDbutCancel runatserver TextCancel     CommandNameCancel gt codepre  pThe multiple functions to theme the buttons and designate the appropriate icons seems rather awkward to me. I keep thinking that I should be able to either loop through some defined array of controls and icons, or tackle it in some other way that would make it easier for me in the future, particularly when Im adding other controls to the page.p  pSuggestions on better ways to set this up are appreciated Thanksp

Negative 75657 pSo I have a list of links in the top portion of my site that allow a user to click on them and when this click event happens I have a javascript function that scrolls a very large list of links within a div on the page. The problem is in IE7 and how it is handling the click event when it is fired. I am using jquery to prevent the default action and this works fine in Chrome, Safari, Firefox and IE 89 but in IE7 the browser is trying to make use of the of the anchor in the default fashion. This anchors href property is just a string that helps me identify the links in the lower portion of the page. If I click the link in IE7 I get a 404 but if I hit the back button and click the link again the script works correctly and the event is handled in the correct fashion. I also tried p  precodeevent.preventDefault  event.preventDefault  event.returnValue  false codepre  pinstead of e.preventDefault but this makes no difference in how IE7 handles the click event in my scenario.p  pAny suggestions Also, on my page I have a tabbed navigation that hides the data associated with that tab if the user is currently viewing the other tab there are only 2 tabs. The content in either tab is roughly the same and the structure is exactly the same but when I execute the exact same process that is causing the error described above on the links in the first default tab, IE has no problems. p

Negative 75657 peveryone I am in trouble again. When I am working with the IP Camera, I met a big problem, that is, when I use JavaFx Component ImageView to show the image tranfered from IP Camera, the picture showing in the imageview is not fluent and smooth, it becomes blank frequently, no matter how I try. But before I use Javafx 2.0 to rebuild the project, I have finished IP Camera part with Swing and SWT Compont, so I was wondering whether I can embed a Swing or SWT compont into JavaFx2.0, it is much better if you know how to show pictures from IP Camera using Javafx2.0.Thanks all.Hope you can help me.p

Negative 75657 pI am modifying a copied build process template codeBuildAndDeploy.xamlcode to include a InvokeProcess activity.

Eventually I would run codeProjectName.deploy.cmdcode multiple times for each of the servers in the web farm.

To troubleshoot I am running a dir s command in the codeBuildDetail.DropLocationcode folder and it always outputs only logs folder and nothing else.

Negative 75657 pIve been using optional parameters in a limited fashion for some time now with .NET 4. Ive recently thought about how the optional parameters are implemented and something dawned on me. p  pTake the following examplep  precodepublic interface ITest      void Gostring val  Interface  codepre  pThe only requirement for implementing this is that the largest form of the signature codevoid Go string valcode be implemented, in fact we need not implement the optional parameter because the compiler takes care of that wireup although the option to use optional parameters will not be available when using the concrete class directly.p  pWith this said, to provide the functionality in both places, and for it to be discoverable in the implementation, one could implement the optional declaration in both interface AND implementation. In fact, the productivity tool ReSharper will pull this optional declaration up to the concrete type automatically when implementing an interface. This seems the logical thing to do. However...p  pWhats to stop us from using different values in the concrete type and interface This set off my alarm bells this morning as if someone goes in to change that value, and forgets to persist it down the inheritance of overrides  interfaces, the behaviour will be completely different depending on how you access the object.

Negative 75657 pIm using C with MonoGame and Im wondering what would be an efficient way to load more than a million card images for a collectible card game. More cards would be continuously added in future updates and what not. Im sure there are some genius ways to go about this which are both elegant and efficient. Im hoping to obtain some insight on how others would solve this problem.p  pThe cards will all be on a client side application the user downloads. The server will make sure the players are not cheating. Im trying to figure out what are efficient ways to manage a large amount of card images on the client side regarding the loading and unloading of the cards.p  pI understand the cards should loaded and shown only when necessary. However, there are points in the game where the user can look through their entire collection. I was thinking with a scrollbar or something along those lines. They can filter their cards based on certain properties of the cards. In this scenario, how would I manage the loadingunloading of the cards in real time to make it seamless and efficient.p
Negative 75657 pConsider following code as totally simplified example of the ideap  precodepublic class Main      public static void foreachint[] x, intVoid action          for int i  0 i lt x.length i              action.applyx[i]                    public static void main String[] args          int[] h  new int[] 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13         for int i  0 i lt 10 i              foreachh, new intVoid                  public void applyint x                      System.out.printlnx  2                                               interface intVoid public void applyint x codepre  pIn the for loop we call codeforeachcode with absolutely identical arguments from logical point of view, since the anonymous implementation of our interface doesnt depend of anything in the context. The question is  will it be instantinated 10 times or only once Or, similar, will it be equivalent for the following codep  precodepublic class Main      public static void foreachint[] x, intVoid action          for int i  0 i lt x.length i              action.applyx[i]                    public static void main String[] args          int[] h  new int[] 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13         intVoid action  new intVoid              public void applyint x                  System.out.printlnx  2                               for int i  0 i lt 10 i              foreachh, action                 interface intVoid public void applyint x codepre  pI sometimes had been in such situations, where its very convenient to define an implementation exactly in place where its needed, but sometimes I also need to be sure that there will be no attempt to create the same object multiple times. If there is an optimization in the runtime, then Im interested in how this is handled in different implementations, especially what will happen if I convert such code to be run in Androids Dalvik VM.br I know that I can test this all myself, but Im wondering if someone has already shed some light on this question.p

Negative 75657 pI currently have a 32bit PowerBuilder application that we are trying to port over to a Windows 7 64bit environment. Realizing the obvious that PowerBuilder 10.5 was built previously before Window7 came out and the big also the obvious fact that this application was built within a Windows XP 32bit environment. p  pThe 32bit PowerBuilder application spits out the following error message when deployed on a Windows 7 64bit machine. strongApplication Terminated. Error Invalid DataWindow rowcolumn specified at line 44 in function emivvisiblecolumnem of object emobjectwindowemstrongp  pThe database profile setup points to an OLEDB and the backend database is MSSQL 2008. Currently the application does run on the Windows7 64bit environment and seems to be working in an inquiry mode only. Meaning we can read some of the records on the datawindow, but as soon as you try to make a transaction it blows up.p  pMy question is  Is it possible to get a 32bit app working in a 64bit environmentp  pSo far the client is asking to come up with possible solutions without the idea of upgrading to PowerBuilder 12.5. Essentially they want to stay at 10.5 but yet get the app working from a 32bit environment to a 64bit...apples to oranges if you know what I mean. Further investigation is needed into whether the code will not function in 64bit or dll issues with powerbuilder client runtime in 64bit. They are really trying to stay away from any app rewrite since the application is older than when Christ was a carpenter. The app was originally built in PB 6.5 I think.p  pSo far I have the following ideas but I am new to this  I understand that Windows 7 comes with a virtual machine IIRC. I think its called WOW64. Is it possible to create a virtual on a server and have the users run a 32bit application inside a 64bit machine Then create a shortcut of somekind for the user to simply click onp  ul liWe do have a virtual XP machine and a virtual Windows7 64 bit machine for testing. PowerBuilder 10.5 actually installed on Windows 7 and seems to be working fine. However running the application in run mode or debug causes many errors as you can imagine.li liThe application has been built in XP and run on Windows 7, but the results yeild the above error message.li liI have not looked yet into the Run under Compatibility mode, but I am told by the team it will not work.li lipI have not looked at UAC or ALC User management yet. Could that be something affecting the 64bit systempli lipI know this is app unrelated but...I have seen in some cases 32bit applications work in a windows 64bit environment by simply targeting certain DLL files. An example case is Microsoft Flight Simulator X where the 32bit game would crash in windows 7 64bit. The solution for that was to simply go get a Vista 64bit DLL file called uiautomationcore.dll and copy that into the windows environment. The Games also have to be installed on the root of C in order to work.pli ul  pDoes anyone have any recommendations on how I can approach this problemp  pI apologize If Im vague in my notes here.p  pstrongUPDATE Has anyone had any experience with PB 10.5 runtime files on a 64 bit machine I am wondering if the powerbuilder client runtime is installing its dlls into the correct location of the application CXXX or cant find it Wondering how to approach this.strongp

Negative 75657 pI started programming Windows 8 apps in C, and I need help to figure how to access files from within my app.p  pPremise from what I learned till this moment, I know that as standard an app can access only certain folders such as LocalFolder etc.. One way to overcome this is using a FileOpenPicker once and then use FutureAccessList to access programmatically the file.p  pNow my situationp  ul limy pc is connected to a domain networkli limy app has the following capabilities Enterprise Authentication, Internet Client amp Server, Private Networks Client amp Serverli liLets say that I have a file named strongim.jpgstrong in strongCstrong and strongim2.jpgstrong in a network share called strongsharestrong. I my domain account have the access to those files.li ul  pHow can I access those files from my app without the use of FileOpenPicker  Till now, I used WebRequest and WebResponse to download a file from an internet site no problems, then I used WebRequest and WebResponse to access a file located in the LocalFolder of my app still no problems, but now, if I do something like thisp  precodeWebRequest c  WebRequest.CreatefileCim.jpg WebResponse r  await c.GetResponseAsync codepre  pI get a System.Net.WebException telling that Im not authorized to access the file. How can I use Enterprise Authentication to provide my domain credentials to the app I didnt find much documentation about this on the MSDN, but from the little I found I think this capability is intended to be used in a situation like this. Also, is WebRequest the right path to follow Should I try to access those files in other waysp  pThanks, Daniele    p

Negative 75657 p[This was posted on the a hrefhttpsdevforums.apple.commessage811323811323 relnofollowApple Developer Forumsa but has not been answered, so Ill try here.]p  pMy application uses a UISplitViewController for iPad masterdetail views and runs on iOS 6. The split view controller is the root view controller for its window. The detail view consists primarily of a UIWebView embedded in a UINavigationController. The only other elements in the detail view are the toolbar and navigation bar offered by the navigation controller. When the web view is displaying a page with an embedded YouTube video, the user can make the video full screen. This is all done by the UIWebViewI am not responsible for creating a fullscreen video player. In case it matters, once the video player is placed in a fullscreen view, the keyWindow of the UIApplication shared instance is not the main application window during video playback, but is instead an instance of MPFullScreenTransitionViewController.p  pIf the user rotates the device during this fullscreen playback, and then ends playback, the UISplitViewController does not properly place its children. The methodsp  precodesplitViewControllerwillHideViewControllerwithBarButtonItemforPopoverController codepre  pandp  precodesplitViewControllerwillShowViewControllerinvalidatingBarButtonItem codepre  pof the delegate in this case, the detail view controller are never called.p  pIf the device was rotated to a landscape orientation while playing fullscreen video, dismissing the movie player results in the presentation of a detail view controller that retains its former bar button item to draw the master view controller in a popover although tapping the button produces no action. Where the master view controller should be drawn, only a black region exists. Swiping right in the detail view controller will slide out the master view controller that covers the black region, but this still exists as a popover rather than a persistent view.p  pIf the device was rotated to a portrait orientation while playing fullscreen video, dismissing the movie player results in the presentation of a detail view controller that lacks a bar button item to draw the master view controller in a popover. The detail view controller has the correct width, and the master view controller is not visible, so the appearance of the detail view is almost as expected except for the missing bar button item.p  pIn both cases, manually rotating the device after the incorrect view appears will restore proper application functionality.

Negative 75657 pwere building a RESTAPI using Spring MVC 3.2, Jackson 1.9.12, Hibernate 4.2.2.p  pYesterday I needed to pass a small object graph to the API, which should get persisted in the database. It some kind of works and I emcouldem build workarounds for those problems, but I think there must be a nicer solution.p  pSo here is what we havep  ul liClass codeBillcodeli liClass codeContactcodeli liClass codeAddresscodeli liClass codeItemcodeli ul  pRelations arep  ul licodeBillcode has emtwoem codeOneToOnecode relations to codeContactcode. One called codesendercode, one called codereceivercode.li licodeBillcode has a codeManyToOnecode relation to codeItemcode, called codeitemcode.li licodeContactcode has a codeOneToOnecode relation to codeAddresscode, called codeaddresscode.li ul  pThis emmayem seem a bit dumb, but I left out some fields and other relations, to bring the problem to the pointp  h2First Problem  Simple case  Overriding database entriesh2  pLets ignore all those dependencies and relations and just take the plain codeBillcode class. If theres an incoming JSON request which doesnt contain an object id everything works as expected and SpringHibernate creates a emnewem entry in databasep  precode ...   createdAt20130529  codepre  pBut if I specify an id in the JSON request, SpringHibernate will update the row containing the given idp  precode ...   idc5a562d0c8ab1c428399080012345678   createdAt20130529  codepre  pIf I specify an id in the JSON request, but that id doesnt exist in database, it will create a new entry.p  pThe code I use is nothing special. Heres the controller actionp  precodeRequestMappingvalue  create, method  RequestMethod.POST ResponseStatusvalue  HttpStatus.CREATED public Bill createRequestBody Bill bill      bill  service.createBillbill     return bill  codepre  pAnd the service methodp  precodePreAuthorizeisAuthenticated Transactional public Bill createBillBill bill      bill  billDao.storebill     return bill  codepre  pAs you can see, Id like to use the codecreatecode path to strongcreatestrong new entries and not update already existing ones. As a workaround I emcouldem of course use codesetIdnullcode in the first line of the controller action, but strongis there any nicerbetter waystrongp  h2Second Problem  Another id thing  How to correctly design entitiesh2  pWe again have the object graph from abovep  precodebill ...   sender ...     address ...    ,   receiver ...     address ...    ,   item ...   codepre  pTheres a logical difference between codeContactcodeand codeAddresscode and codeItemcodep  ul liA codeContactcode and codeAddresscode consists of a bunch of emnewem data. Means The GUI will display a lot input fields, which the user has to fill in.li liAn codeItemcode emis alreadyem in the database, and I basically would just need its codeidcode, not the whole object. This means The GUI will display a dropdown list with all existing codeItemcodes and the user has to choose one of them.li ul  pNow of course Id like to use and reuse my entities, but my codeBillcode entity for example expects an codeItemcode object, not an codeitemidcode. As a workaround I could of course create another bean, which is nearly the same as the codeBillcode class, but instead of codeitemcode it contains an codeitemidcodep  precodethenewspecialbillforincomingjson ...   sender ...     address ...    ,   receiver ...     address ...    ,   itemid ...   codepre  pSo again, the same question strongIs there a nicerbetter waystrongp  pThank you guysp

Negative 75657 pWe need to reduce the memory consumption of our title, initially for iOS and then later for Android. p  pOne of the areas were looking at is code stripping as suggested in the article a hrefhttpdocs.unity3d.comDocumentationManualiphoneplayerSizeOptimization.html relnofollowOptimizing the Size of the Built iOS Playera.p  pTesting the various stripping levels, assemblies and byte code, we are experiencing a crash at runtime.

Negative 75657 penter image description hereIm a new programmer and Im working on a text adventure that uses dropdown boxes choice as an input device. I have an itemListener on the first box that populates the members of the 2nd with the members that can be added. The player is then allowed to click the submit button and the first box is reset to the first item on the list and the second box is supposed to be cleared. When I run the program, the first time it reacts exactly as planned. The 2nd time I try to input something using the drop down boxes, the dropdown box doesnt respond. I put a marker inside the itemListener to see if it was even triggering to find out that it wasnt. I feel like Ive tweeked the program in every way imaginable but I have no idea what is causing this issue.

Negative 75657 pIn my program, I have one frame with tabs in it. Each tab will have its own panels and offer different features. However, within the tab, Ive been trying to figure out a way to make it dynamic without constantly removing components from the main panel the main panel being the one used inside the tab and readding other components. I feel like there should be a better way to do this. p  pHeres an example of what I mean inside of one of the tabsp  precodeifBack.equalse.getActionCommand          EventsPanel.removeEventDetailPane         EventsPanel.removeEventDetailButton         EventsScreen         PaneRefreshEventsPanel  codepre  pWhere PaneRefreshJPanel pane and EventsScreen are defined asp  precodepublic void EventsScreen      EventsPanel.addlistpane, BorderLayout.CENTER     EventsPanel.addlistpanebuttons, BorderLayout.SOUTH   public void PaneRefreshJPanel pane      pane.revalidate     pane.repaint  codepre  pThe User presses the back button and the frame changes to the components that came beforehand removingadding and then revalidating and repainting everything. This seems like a very inefficient way to do this. Does anyone have any better ideas I was thinking that maybe using code.setVisibilecode would work, but I have not had very much experience using it.p  pAlso, this question may have been answered at some point, however I could not find it and was not sure what exactly to look up for a question that may have pertained to this.p

In my database I want to store things like UserAgent, IPAddress, OS etc. This I will encrypt using MCRYPT and store. To match against a user, a lot of variables have to be set, this makes it somewhat harder than just copying the cookie contents to login. p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pHeres when my problem starts... The UserAgent and OS are nearly if not completely identical.  The reason is that it are Fat Clients with the same bootable image. Another problem is the IP. The server in the Datacenter has a connection to the office. For our applications even tho not externally accessible the IPAddress is the same for every client. I found out that I could try to use the XForwardedFor header to distinguish IP addresses and thus make the user a bit more unique.p  pstrongWhats nextstrongp  pWhat I would like to know is the following How can I make sure the XForwardedFor is ALWAYS set without having to anything the clients have access to Does something have to be added there by routing Our connection is https, so I doubt I can just inject something. Next to that, if I can inject something like this, can the users client side do thisp  pemThe clients are in our internal office network and the applications running in php are not accessible from the outsideemp

However I cant submit it, because Facebook cant access my iOS App by the AppID in iTunes store. See the following error messagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOb7Rn.png altenter image description herep  pIf I insert an AppID from any public app e.g. Whatsapp I can save my changes and I am able to submit the Facebook App.p  pMy fear is that if my iOS app comes to the App Store and the Facebook feature doesnt work, Ill receive bad ratings from users.p  pSo my question is Is there any way to send my Facebook app for review without my iOS app being released to the publicp  p EDIT according to Bjrn Kaisers answer I want to submit only my Open Graph story, but the problem is that I have to add screenshots. If I click on Add Screenshots a popup opens and I have to select the platform, but I cant select the iOS platform that I added in the settings its not visible because it has no iPhone Store ID. Again if I add for testing an iPhone Store ID from a public app e.g. Whatsapp, Im able to select the iOS platform to add screenshots.p  pSee here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comShZGT.png altenter image description herep  pAnd without these screenshots I cant submit for review  Its a doom loop.p  pUPDATE 29.01.2014 As proposed I selected Webseite as platform and uploaded screenshots from using Facebook in my iOS App in hope that the Facebook reviewers would understand that the screenshots are showing an iOS App, but today I failed review img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comR0Ska.png altenter image description herep

Negative 75657 pIm using ARC. I have UINavigationController to push and pop. It happens that one of the ViewController is a huge scrollview holding up 100MB. After popViewController, the ViewController that contains the scrollview is supposed to release. NSLog shows that dealloc was called. However, the 100MB memory is still occupied. Is it normal p  pIf dealloc of the viewController get called, does it mean that its retainCount is already Zero and Im not leaking the viewController p  pThanks in advancep  pRef a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9226023memorynotreleasedwhenpopviewcontrollercalledMemory not released when popViewController Calleda APURV is suggesting there is a cache mechanism of iOS that holds up memory.

But this time, I have Personal Hotspot of my iPhone ON and have it downloading something continuously. I then run the app again with the same code. I see this  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comU3gwl.png altenter image description herep  pThe spike in the middle is the 100MB scrollview, now if I popViewController, it goes back to 12MB. It makes me think that theres really a cache going on in iOS and is depending on memory availability. When its out of memory, the cache will be washed away, also, release will then happen immediately. p  pI will also try to learn to Instrument and post result here later. p

Negative 75657 pSorry, I searched around for 2 days before I had to post this question. There are similar questions, but none of them helped me. p  pI am trying to create a simple chat application where the client uses nonNIO Socket to connect to the server that listens with a NIO ServerSocketChannel. The server uses a Selector. Until the first client connects, the Selector.select method is blocked, as expected. But after the first client connects, Selector.select does not block and returns immediately. This causes my while loop to run continuously.p  pSorry, Ive pasted the entire code so that you can copypaste it and run it. Ive just started with Java, so any helppointers will be very much appreciated. Thank you.p  pP.S. Right now, the client sends serialized object Message object over the socket connection and the Server reads it. Since the connection is nonblocking, the serialized object is prefixed with the object size in bytes before it is sent to the server. This allows the server to read the next x bytes and unserialize into a Message object. The server code is a work in progress.p  pCLIENT CODEp  precodeimport java.io.BufferedInputStream import java.io.BufferedOutputStream import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream import java.io.DataOutputStream import java.io.ObjectOutputStream import java.io.ObjectInputStream import java.net.InetAddress import java.net.Socket import java.net.UnknownHostException import java.nio.ByteBuffer  public class ChatClient       void go         User u  new User         u.setNameUserA         try             u.setInetInetAddress.getLocalHost         catch UnknownHostException ex             System.out.printlnex             return                  Message m  new Message         m.setType3         m.setTextThis is the 1st message.         m.setFromUseru         try             Socket sock  new Socket InetAddress.getLocalHost, 5000             DataOutputStream dataOut  new DataOutputStreamsock.getOutputStream              ByteArrayOutputStream byteTemp  new ByteArrayOutputStream             ObjectOutputStream objOut  new ObjectOutputStream byteTemp             objOut.writeObjectm             objOut.flush             objOut.close              byte[] byteMessage  byteTemp.toByteArray             ByteBuffer bb  ByteBuffer.allocate4             bb.putIntbyteMessage.length             byte[] size  new byte[4]             size  bb.array             System.out.printlnObject size  byteMessage.length 370              ByteArrayOutputStream byteOut  new ByteArrayOutputStream             byteOut.writesize             byteOut.writebyteMessage              byte[] finalMessage  byteOut.toByteArray             dataOut.writefinalMessage,0,finalMessage.length             dataOut.flush             System.out.printlnFlushed out         catch Exception ex             System.out.printlnex                    public static void main String args[]         new CopyOfChatClient.go       codepre  pSERVER CODE p  precode    import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream     import java.io.IOException     import java.io.ObjectInputStream     import java.net.InetSocketAddress     import java.nio.ByteBuffer     import java.nio.channels.SelectionKey     import java.nio.channels.Selector     import java.nio.channels.ServerSocketChannel     import java.nio.channels.SocketChannel     import java.util.Iterator     import java.util.Set     import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock      public class CopyOfChatServer          Object a, bDummy objects for synchronization         SocketChannel clientSocknull         Selector selector         SelectionKey key          void go             try                 anew ObjectDummy objects for synchronization                 bnew ObjectDummy objects for synchronization                 ServerSocketChannel serverSock  ServerSocketChannel.open                 serverSock.socket.bindnew InetSocketAddress5000                 Note ServerSocketChannel is blocking, but each new connection returned by accept will be made nonblocking see below                 selector  Selector.open                 new Threadnew SelectorThread.start Start the SelectorThread                 int i0                 while true                                    clientSock  serverSock.accept                     if clientSocknull                                           clientSock.configureBlockingfalse The default client socket returned by accept is blocking.

Negative 75657 pIm making a Java GUI for a game which needs to show a map of the area around the player which is 7x7 tiles large.

I will remove them and print the new set every time the map refreshes. p  pHowever I wanted to know if there was an easier or better way of achieving this Or if this was a good idea.p

Negative 75657 pId be grateful if people could help me find an efficient way probably low memory algorithm to tackle the following problem.p  pI need to find the stationary distribution codexcode of a transition matrix codePcode. The transition matrix is an extremely large, extremely sparse matrix, constructed such that all the columns sum to 1. Since the stationary distribution is given by the equation codePx  xcode, then codexcode is simply the eigenvector of codePcode associated with eigenvalue 1.p  pIm currently using GNU Octave to both generate the transition matrix, find the stationary distribution, and plot the results. Im using the function codeeigscode, which calculates both eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and it is possible to return just one eigenvector, where the eigenvalue is 1 I actually had to specify 1.1, to prevent an error. Construction of the transition matrix using a sparse matrix is fairly quick, but finding the eigenvector gets increasingly slow as I increase the size, and Im running out of memory before I can examine even moderately sized problems.p  pMy current code isp  precode[v l]  eigsP, 1, 1.01 x  v  sumv codepre  pGiven that I know that 1 is the eigenvalue, Im wondering if there is either a better method to calculate the eigenvector, or a way that makes emmore efficient use of memoryem, given that I dont really need an intermediate large dense matrix. I naively triedp  precoden  sizeP,1        number of states Q  P  speyen,n x  Qzerosn,1     solve PIx  0 codepre  pwhich fails, since Q is singular by definition.p  pI would be very grateful if anyone has any ideas on how I should approach this, as its a calculation I have to perform a great number of times, and Id like to try it on larger and more complex models if possible.p  pAs background to this problem, Im solving for the equilibrium distribution of the number of infectives in a cattle herd in a stochastic SIR model. Unfortunately the transition matrix is very large for even moderately sized herds. For example in an SIR model with an average of 20 individuals 95 of the time the population is between 12 and 28 individuals, codePcode is 21169 by 21169 with 20340 nonzero values i.e. 0.0005 dense, and uses up 321 Kb a full matrix of that size would be 3.3 Gb, while for around 50 individuals codePcode uses 3 Mb. codexcode itself should be pretty small. I suspect that codeeigscode has a dense matrix somewhere, which is causing me to run out of memory, so I should be okay if I can avoid using full matrices.p

The first table is placed in the correct position, but the second is not. The solution from that thread works if I have no more than 1 table produced by grid.table.

Negative 75657 pIm using Linux 2.6.32 device that establishes a VPN connection. When VPN is up, all packets sent by the device, includes the VPN client src address.p  pICMP packets continuously go through the VPN interface and successfully encrypteddecrypted, and after that they are sent to the WLAN via the WLAN interface as ESP packet with the VPN Interface as src ip.p  pAfter disabling the VPN, the VPN interface goes down, ICMP packets are sent directly to the WLAN interface with the WLAN Interface as src ip in plaintext unencrypted.

Negative 75657 pIve been struggling with this issue for the last several days and can not figure out a workaround... Maybe somebody will be able to help me p  pI am trying to make a jasperserver report with dynamic images, stored on a network shared network folder on different windows machine. p  pIn iReport I define codeImage Expressioncode as codeSERVERNAMEIMAGESCAMERANAME000000.jpgcode codeImage Expression Classcode as codejava.lang.Stringcode  everything works fine. p  pEven getting the image location and file name from the DB and forming codeImage Expressioncode like so codeFADRESSSFCAMERANAME.FFILENAMEcode is no problem at all.

Also I can not publish and make them accessible via web url due to security reasons. p  pMaybe someone has experienced the same problem and knows a solution Or maybe I am trying to do the impossible thing herep  pP.S. I am running JasperServer CE 5.5 on Win Server 2008 R2 machine.br Warehouse server holding several TB of images in its filestructure is also running on Win Server 2008 R2.br Both jasperserver and image warehouse machines see each other via the network tested by running iReport report on jasperserver machine.   p

Negative 75657 pI created a book app and used Cocos2D and physics engine Chipmunk to create it. I would like to add read aloud feature to it. So far I found instructionsbooks and tutorials how to add read aloud feature when book is created with iBook Author but I couldnt use iBook Author due to some limitations using Epub3 and SMIL. I also found a good tutorial from J. Shapiro how to make narrated book using AVSpeechSynthesizer. This helps, only that I would like to use recorded voice, rather than synthesized sound. I dont know if this approach can be modified to do so I also know how it can be done in Sprite Kit framework.  The only info that I couldnt find is how to add read aloud feature to the app written using Cocos2D. Could it be done within SimpleAudioEngine, or it can be combined with some other engine possibly from Sprite Kit framework I would appreciate very much if somebody can give me some referencespointers or tutorial links where to look for some answers how to add this feature. Thanking you in advance.p

Negative 75657 pI want top  ol liLoad only the fields I want, from multiple tablesmodels.li liGet back model objects, not the namedtuplelike objects I would from get passing the columns to codesession.querycode. This should span relationships, so for instance codeemployee.company.namecode, where company is a relationship field in the Employee model.li liPrevent other fields from being inadvertently loaded after the initial select query. I could use codedefercode or code.loadonlyfieldnamecode but then someone else could access an attribute of the model I didnt specify and that would cause another query to run.

Negative 75657 pMy company has a large selection of templates which are used to generate customer correspondence.  I need to modify the existing processes so that copies of generated files template  data are saved for later editing.p  pMy problem is that when I open one of these saved MSWord documents, edit, then close, MSWord is insisting that changes have been made to the template the one selected in the generation process.p  pI am not really sure why this is happening, but it may be that the generated document contains a reference to the template upon which it was based, but that because the template is in a remote location, MSWord is attempting to generate a new local file.p  pIf that diagnosis is correct, then I need a method to remove the template reference from the document.p  pIf the diagnosis is incorrect then what is the likely explanationsolutionp  hr  pI have found that BOTH resultant files contain a reference to the template.p  pNote Manual editing in Word has no issue.

Heres my codep  precodepackage application2  public class Application2   private static int turn  0 private static String[] names  new String[3]  private static class syncThreads extends Thread       private final char charToPrint     private final int times      public syncThreadschar charToPrint          this.charToPrint  charToPrint         this.times  times           Override     public synchronized void run          String myName  Thread.currentThread.getName         for int i  0 i lt 20 i              if myName.equalsnames[turn]                  System.out.printcharToPrint                          turn             if turn  3                  turn  0                                notifyAll         try              Thread.currentThread.wait200          catch InterruptedException e                    public static void mainString args[]       syncThreads t1  new syncThreadsa     names[0]  t1.getName     syncThreads t2  new syncThreadsb     names[1]  t2.getName     syncThreads t3  new syncThreadsc     names[2]  t3.getName      t1.start     t2.start     t3.start      Join method ensures proper synchronization     try          t1.join         t2.join         t3.join      catch Exception e          System.out.printlnInterrupt Exception.         codepre  pAs you can see, Im attempting to use a synchronized run function that uses a token value to tell which thread to print. When I run this I get very strange results like aaaaaabbbbcccc and abbabbaaaaccccbbccc, etc. Any idea why these threads arent being synchronized What am I missing herep  pThank you for any helpp
Negative 75657 pIm currently on a curious trip and Im trying to create a codenativecode method that returns the memory address of a Java codeObjectcode.p  pI have properly configure Androids NDK and my Java method isp  precodepublic static native String getAddressOfObject obj codepre  pFollowing that, my native implementation in Cp  precodejstring JavacomdanysantiagoandmemutilMemoryUtilsgetAddressOfJNIEnv env, jobject clazz, jobject obj      char buffer[11]     sprintfbuffer, p, obj     return envgtNewStringUTFenv, buffer  codepre  pBut for some reason the returned string address is always the same no matter how much I play around with the app on the emulator. Im assuming Im not getting the actual memory pointer or my Java knowledge of how objects are stored in memory is wrong.p  pstrongMore Background Storystrong I have successfully obtained the address of an codeObjectcode in a standard Java app that runs on my computers JVM following a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma206806671305867this stackoverflow answera. I was able to confirm it because I made a heap dump and then used a hrefhttpwww.eclipse.orgmat relnofollowMATa to do a search for address which resulted in an instance of my dummy class. However, codesun.misc.unsafecode is not available in Android.p  pWhen I try to follow similar steps, making a heap dump of the Android app and searching for the address  that the method returns I get no result, but if I use a hrefhttpvisualvm.java.netoqlhelp.html relnofollowOQLa, that is available with MAT I can find the instance of my dummy class with a different address.p  pLooking at how using codeunsafecode one gets the address makes me wonder that in reality I too, with native code, have to calculate the address inspecting the codeObjectcode fields.p  pBring in your knowledge awesome people Thanks p

Observatory isnt very helpful in understanding what is allocating memory to codeListcode instances, since there are nearly a million instances. Im also not convinced that Observatory itself doesnt contribute to the memory footprint of the app that its trying to monitor. p  pCan anyone tell me how the codeListcode class is used so that we can begin to address what is allocating so much memoryp

Negative 75657 pIm trying to write a class with drawing operation that directy draw onto the screen. My Idea was to have a constant loop, which is rendering the graphics buffer and several functions, that write into the graphics buffer lines, rectangles, etc. Now there is the problem with the threads. I cant write into the graphics buffer, when it is used in a loop in a different thread. But I need the different thread to keep a constant performanceframerate. I tried to kind of create a shared buffer in form of a bitmap, but the performance just sucks.

In this view there is a camera button, which initiates a segue to the view controller posted below. strongThe goal here is to allow still images to be added to these note objects which contain text and the image.strong I hope you can tolerate this code, which Im sure is extremely messy and amateurish. p  pHere is the full code for the custom view being used by the camera view controllerp  precodeimport UIKit import AVFoundation      class DEZCamPreviewView UIView       var session AVCaptureSession          get              return self.layer as AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer.session                   set              self.layer as AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer.session  newValue                    override class func layerClass gt AnyClass          return AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer.self        codepre  pHere is the full code for the camera view controllerp  precodeimport UIKit import AVFoundation import AssetsLibrary  class DEZCamViewController UIViewController    Store the note to send back its image. var note Note  IBOutlet weak var captureButton UIButton IBOutlet weak var previewView DEZCamPreviewView  Session management. var sessionQueue dispatchqueuet  Communicate with the session and other session objects on this queue. var session AVCaptureSession var videoDeviceInput AVCaptureDeviceInput var stillImageOutput AVCaptureStillImageOutput  override func viewDidLoad      super.viewDidLoad      self.session  AVCaptureSession       Setup the preview view     self.previewView.session  session      self.sessionQueue  dispatchqueuecreatesession queue, DISPATCHQUEUESERIAL      dispatchasyncsessionQueue          self.backgroundRecordingID  UIBackgroundTaskInvalid          var error NSError          let videoDevice AVCaptureDevice  DEZCamViewController.deviceWithMediaTypeAVMediaTypeVideo, preferringPosition .Back          let videoDeviceInput AVCaptureDeviceInput  AVCaptureDeviceInputdevice videoDevice, error amperror          if let error  error              printlnerror.localizedDescription                   if self.session.canAddInputvideoDeviceInput              self.session.addInputvideoDeviceInput             self.videoDeviceInput  videoDeviceInput              dispatchasyncdispatchgetmainqueue                   Why are we dispatching this to the main queue                  Because AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer is the backing layer for AVCamPreviewView and                   UIView can only be manipulated on main thread.

At one point, the controller was capturing images when the capture button was pressed, but instead of proceeding to the previous view it only showed the previous view for a moment before showing the camera preview...this happened 910 times I touched the capture button in one sitting, so I started stripping down the controller until I thought I had the bare minimum of necessary code.p  pNow the problem is that the image is either never captured, or its captured but never successfully sent back to the previous view controller. Can anyone shed light on why this is not working Or, better yet, can anyone direct me to a embare essentialsem implementation of still image capture with AVFoundation in Swiftp

Negative 75657 pIm trying to do a couple things with my code and I am confused as to how to interact with the elements of an array. The point of this code is to take a string as an input and redact certain words.p  pMy goals arep  p1. Have my program redact multiple words.p  p2.

You get Hello REDACTED Okay REDACTED as the output. p  pI emthinkem its because its printing the modified string text and NOT the array [words] which is kind of what I want because I want the redacted string to be saved to a variable.

Negative 75657 pI am currently developing a webbased application which features an user interface, that needs to get updated when a user selects an option from a dropdown menu. This may happen in a cascaded way such asp  ol liUser picks an option from first selectfieldli liGUI is updated and presents additional select fields to choose from eg. refine categoryli liUser refines selection, this may leed to another update etc.li ol  pI am using jquery to load the updated pieces from the server. Up to now I only needed to update one pieceblock of the interface at a time, and I tried to minimize the amount of data being transferd  so if I only needed to update a select box, I used p  precodedocument.onchange,select[namefirstlevelselectfield],function     .getajaxhandler.php,action  getsecondlevel,                  firstlevelvalue  this.val     .errorfunctiondata,msg,text         alertRequest faileddata,msgtext          .successfunctiondata,status,text         select[namefirstlevelselectfield].htmldata       codepre  pAs you can see, the server side creates a readymade htmlpiece which is inserted into the second level select box. Same happens for other user interactions.p  pNow I came across a new use case which requires me to update not only a single select field but also to display an appropriate hint to the user. First solution was to make another ajaxrequest to the server to fetch the information again an piece of HTML and insert into the GUI in the right place. While this certainly works, I was wondering if I am doing it right  some thoughts came to mep  ol liIs making multiple requests a good idea or should I create a package eg. wrap up the pieces in a JSONarray and process it on the client sideli liFor more complex GUIs Is it better to use some kind of container element and update the whole container each time which simplifies the code on the client side, but introduces additional latency and increases the amount of data to be transferedli ol  pAny suggestion and discussion is welcome  maybe its just another case of TIMTOWTDI and any solution that produces the correct result is ok.p

Negative 75657 pI am developing an MVC app to serve multiple domains  each is a branch of a larger company. p  pA codeLocalBranchcode class stores details such as phone, address, email, location coordinates etc. p  pemI want to create a single instance of this class per http request and have it available throughout the application  from within controllers, views, some helper classes and other code.em p  pIs there a recommended way of doing this p  pRight now I have it as a property on a codeBaseControllercode and use codeViewBagcodeto pass it to views.

Negative 75657 pI have the contents of a zip file in a byte array.  The file contains a number of entries typically about 12, but I only care about three of them.p  pI would like to somehow get this into a codeZipFilecode object, so I can pull those specific three codeZipEntrycodes out using codeZipFile.getEntrycode.  Im open to using something other than codeZipFilecode that has a similar lookupbyname method like codegetEntrycode.p  pMy initial investigation suggests that Im out of luck. codeZipFilecode requires a real file in the file subsystem which I cannot and do not want to access and so I cant get there from here, and no means other than codeZipFilecode exists that allows extracting particular entries by name but I wanted to check.  In languages like C and Python, this is pretty straightforward in C I go from byte array to codeMemoryStreamcode to codeZipArchivecode in Python I just wrap it in codeStringIOcode and treat like a file, so I wanted to make sure Im not missing something obvious.p  pMy Plan B is to use codeZipInputStreamcode and repeated calls to codegetNextEntrycode to go through all dozen or so entries, and throw away all except the three I care about, but that just smells bad to me.p

Negative 75657 pIm using a hrefhttpsgithub.complataformatecresponders relnofollowrespondersa gem in my Rails 4.2 application. I got a pretty complex situation, where in a codeOrganizationcode model edit view I got a  form for a codeOrganizationUsercode with one input. Adding user to organization invokes a codecreatecode action in a codeOrganizationUsersControllercode. I am using responders there with redirect action, something like thisp  precodedef create   organizationuser  organization.organizationusers.createorganizationuserparams   respondwith organizationuser do format     format.html  redirectto editorganizationpathorganization    end end codepre  pAnd my translationsp  precodeflash   actions     create       notice resourcename was successfully created.       alert resourcename could not be created.   organizationusers     create       notice Member has been added       alert Validation error codepre  pThe problem is that everything works if a resource is valid and is persisted to database. I am redirected to edit organization view with a proper notice message, but if validation fails I am redirected without any alert.p  pI can of course set flash alert message unless codeorganizationusercode is persisted, but thats the whole point of using responders to set flashes automatically.p
Negative 75657 pI am trying to write a testing program that checks user responses against a database basically 3 arrays.

If the users answers are wrong, the question should be repeatedly asked. My code works for last name and major, but for some reason hometown is glitching. Here is the output p  precodeWhat is Ellens last name Guo What is Ellens last name Gao What is Ellens hometown asdf What is Ellens hometown awsefd What is Ellens hometown Shanghai China What is Ellens hometown What is Ellens hometown Shaghai China What is Ellens hometown What is Ellens hometown Shanghai China What is Ellens hometown What is Ellens hometown codepre  pAs you can see, I cant get past hometown, even though I know my answer is correct. I entered the correct answer yet the question is repeatedly asked and the loop does not break. I changed the order of the questions used to be last name, major, hometown, now its last name, hometown, major but this has had no effect.

Negative 75657 pIm designing a REST API and despite trawling a number of best practice guides I cant find much relating to the strongembest practiceemstrong of handling the disparity between representation structure needed for a codePOSTcode vs the same representation structure returned from a codeGETcode.p  pcodeGETcode for a dummy codeusercode representation might look like thisp  precode     id 1234,     created 20120423T182543.511Z,     username johndoeexample.com,     name John Doe  codepre  pHowever, codePOSTcode for the same dummy codeusercode representation cannot specify certain properties namely the codeidcode and codecreatedcodep  precode     username johndoeexample.com,     name John Doe  codepre  pObviously this is an overly simplified example but given that the user cannot specify certain fields and it might not always be obvious which ones are pertinent to the applied method is it strongembest practiceemstrong to create separate representations for each or to expect the most complete version and handle the data disparity transparently on the server p  pDespite the apparent ease of having a single representation and handling the disparity server side I am worried that this would be a bad experience for a user if it wasnt clear which values can be specified or altered using codePUTcode for example. If the tendency is to create separate representations is there a naming convention to apply to the representation definition p  pe.g. codeiusercode for incoming user and codeousercode for outgoing user. Or codeuserfullcode and codeusermincode or codeusercode and code.usercode etc.p  pstrongUpdatestrong My overly simplified example perhaps didnt properly illustrate the issue. Imagine a representation that has 50 properties for example a server representation with all its monitoring attributes  cpu, ram, temp, storagedrivea, storagedriveb, filepermission etc. Of these 50 properties, 30 are read only properties and 20 of these are values that can be set.p

Negative 75657 pIm writing an application which needs to have personally identifiable information removedabsent at all times from the emdatabaseem. Given that someone may use their real name in their username, and that an email address may be present in their AspUserIdentity records, I have decided one solution might be to hash these values. In simple terms when someone logs in with a username, I hash the username they entered and see if that hash exists in the database if it does, then I log them in. This is easy to do and works just fine by modifying the Login and Register methods in the AccountController. But now I am left with no knowledge of the entered username...p  pI could just store the username in session, but that seems jankety. What Id like to do is to update the cookie that gets sent down upon successful login to use the username they entered and not the hashed value stored in the DB. That way User.Identity.GetUserName returns the plain text username and not the hashed username. To the client the process ought to be transparent and to me as the programmer too. p  pThe question is how Whats the best place to do this Im still relatively green when it comes to the latest ASP.NET Identity stuff. I see in Startup.Auth theres a lot of juicy stuff related to cookies, but I dont see anywhere I can modify the cookie itself upon login and prior to it being sent down. p  pIs all of this deep within Owin itself p  pThanks in advance, p

Negative 75657 pOK, so Im doing RMS prop or SGD to get a neural network to learn its parameters. But, after a while, both training and validation errors appear to have stagnated outside of random fluctuations Im using dropout..p  pSo, I decided, to try to use conjugate gradient to refine the values. I still obviously dont want it to overfit, so I was keeping the dropout... But, of course, this makes the optimization function be noisy. So, I guess my question is Does Conjugate Gradient or LBFGS or etc. require noiseless functions Or can they work in the presence of noisep  pThanksp

Negative 75657 pIm new to programming, Ive been making an app for the last 3 months and learned a few things. But I havent come across to how to solve this issue. Ive been using Parse.com as my server, sending pictures, saving user data etc. With all of this data the app keeps crashing if I open some activities more than a few times, particularly activities with pictures. Now I have compressed the pictures and made them max 400x400 in resolution. But somehow the allocation is out of memory keeps popping up. Does anyone know any methods with which you can solve this Because when the app crashes in Android Studio the previous memory which was on my phone seems to get deleted Not all of the cache data.p

Can someone please show a simple example of how that is done I search online but I cant find anything maybe I am searching wrong. So I know about polymorphism through interface and and extension such asp  precodeclass MyClass extends Parent implements Naming codepre  pin such case I am achieving polymorphism twice MyClass is at once of type codeParentcode and codeNamingcode. But I dont get how injection works. The idea is that I would not be using the codeOverridecode keyword during injection. I hope the question is clear. Thanks.p  pSo the end result here, per my understanding, is to change the behavior of a method through injection instead of by codeOverridecode it during development.p

Negative 75657 pIm using Rails to create a questionnaire application. I have a created a scaffold with the model called Question. The questionnaire has 30 questions so when I create a new questionnaire I have a long list of questions in a row to answer, generated with the form helper in the form partial. Instead of the long list of 30 questions I would rather want to display only one question at a time but Im not sure what solution to use.p  pI looked into the possibility to use the gem Will Paginate to display the questions one at a time. But it seems that Will Paginate is not designed to be used with a formfor and post method, so it does not seem like a proper solution.p  pThen I tried to figure out if I could use AJAX to display one question at a time but I could not find any documentation or example were AJAX were used on a form to accomplish this.p  pThe last solution I could think of is to use a separate view or partial per question but it would be a tedious job to create all those files so maybe not a good solution either.p  pWhat would be the best way to solve this problemp

That comes at an expense of introducing other overhead as tasks themselves are complex creatures.

This check causes transactions to cross aggregate boundaries e.g., codeTaskAcode and codeJobAcode.li liAn equipment cannot be assigned to more than 1 job.

This transaction will cross equipment and job aggregates.li ol  pHaving a single aggregate will put all transactions inside the boundary but that will make the aggregate impossibly large.

Negative 75657 pYoure going to have to bare with me on this one because it will be quite hard to explain, but I have run into a really big roadblock and could use the help.p  pCurrently I am working on a project within an excel database and am trying to match 4 different properties which all have their own collumns A,B,C,D to find a corresponding value on a different page Sheet2.  One sheet 2 the values are once again found in their own collumns B,C,D,E and if all of the values match I then want the value in collumn A Sheet2 to be displayed in collumn E on sheet1p  pThe problem is is that often times the values on Sheet1 will be able to match up with as many as 12 different unique rows on Sheet2 making this incredibly difficult with only intermediate experience in VBA.  There can be duplicates that match all of the criteria. And for when this happens I would like to return the first item that matches, as long as a previous match was not made on that item.   p  pTo give you more information we have given products different values that designate where they belong based off their velocity. This has split them up into Section, ShelvingType, Verticle, and Horizontal Location. And we are looking to match these values to the values of our previously existing locations that we have that have correspondingmatching numbers or text values. p  pTo go into even more detail, on sheet one we have the products with values on where they should go. One sheet two with have preexisting locations for which products can go that have values that are represntative of that location. So, we want to take the products NEW location values off page one and match the existing location values on page two. The problem is that for every location there are up to 12products that could go there. So, we want to go in order saying that product1 goes in the first location with matched values while product2 goes in the next location with matched values, and so on and so fourthp

Negative 75657 pA few months back I read a hrefhttpteropa.infoblog20141024howiveimprovedmyangularappsbybanningngcontroller.html relnofollowthis article about not using ngcontrollera and adopted the idea behind it that angular apps should be sets of components working together.p  pThe basic idea was that you would use isolate scope directives with their own controllers like thisp  precode.directivemyAppContestantList, function      return        scope ,       templateUrl myappcontestantlist.html,       replace true,       controller ContestantListCtrl,       controllerAs ctrl           .controllerContestantListCtrl, function      this.contestants  [       firstName Rachel, lastName Washington,       firstName Joshua, lastName Foster,       firstName Samuel, lastName Walker,       firstName Phyllis, lastName Reynolds     ]    codepre  pand instead of making your a data property of codescopecode in your controller, you made it a property of codethiscode codethiscode being the controller itself. Defining variables on the controller meant you could reference your data in your html just by prefixing your data with codectrlcode because thats what you put in the codecontrollerAscode fieldp  precodeltli ngrepeatcontestant in ctrl.contestantsgt     contestant.firstName contestant.lastName ltligt codepre  pThis worked perfectly fine for me, and I began nesting directives instead of nesting controllers, which solved the nested codescopecode problem.p  pGiven that background, what I dont understand is why the article advocates defining variables on your controller instead of on codescopecode. Its true that previously codescopecode was a huge problem because once you had nested scopes it would be a mess, but using the pattern it advocates of isolated scope directives, variables defined on codescopecode never leak.p  pYou would also never find yourself in the position where there would be more than one controller in the template so codecontrollerAscode seems useless as well.p  pI say this after being very successful using the pattern for a few months with variables defined on my controller. Id just like to know ifwhy its better to do that than define them on scope instead of blindly following along with the article.p  pDoes it possibly have to do with codebindToControllercodep  pCould someone point me in the right directionp
Negative 75657 pSo i am using ajax to filter and load posts into a container. I want to limit the amount of posts to 6 at a time and add a load more button underneath if there are more than 6 posts, but i dont want to add pages because i have a few containers on the same page that im using this same treatment for and my understanding is pages would add a page1 or something like that to the url am i wrong.p  pEither way, i just want to know how to check if there are more posts that fit this criteria so i can show the load more button, and then when the load more button fires how do i just load 6 more.

Negative 75657 pIm making a simple command line game with Ruby and Im having trouble saving some information without a databaseHTTP dynamic.p  pFor example, lets say I have to make a sandwich in the game. I am presented with an array of ingredients to choose from, like sop  precode[1] Carrot [2] Banana [3] Cheese [4] Tomato codepre  pI cannot hardcode a direct correspondence between number and ingredient because, before that, I was forbidden to use a couple of ingredients, at random so the complete ingredients array is two items longer. And I dont want to present a list numbered like code[1] [2] [4] [6]code because it gets confusing. p  pWhat Im doing right now is hardcoding a direct correspondence between a letter and an item, so for codeBananacode press codeBcode, for codeCheesecode press codeCcode and so on. But its less than ideal, particularly because this is a pattern used throughout the game, and in some contexts it will get very inconvenient, both for me and the player.p  pSo, is there a better way for me to do this How can I associate an input with an item of a list that is generated randomly, and also save that information for further use down the linep

Negative 75657 pI am using the below jquery to remove or add a class to a div sidebar when the user scrolls away from the top of the page. As you can see I have the script set to only apply after 500 pixels have been cleared. This works perfectly at the top of the page, but if a user is further down the page they can manually force sidebar to appear the script still removes the .active class but it ignores the 500 delay.

Negative 75657 pFirst off I am just learning so be patient, I have an Http listener that listens to local host and if a request is made to local host then redirect it to alternative domain and make the request there instead. This is working flawlessly however its not exactly what I am trying to accomplish for 2 reasons, 1 for it to redirect x url I must add it to the host file obviouslywhich I do not want to do and 2 some of the domains I want to redirect use an IP address and therefore can not be added to the host file.p  pThis is what I am trying to accomplish, I need a program that can run in the background and listen to all trafficwithout editing host file if a request is made to example.com I want it to redirect the exact request to example2.com and get the response from there instead, or it could also let the request be made at example.com and catch the response and edit the response with the response from example2.com and then send it back to the requesting client. Can anyone point me in the right direction Httplistener is almost perfect except I dont want to have to add everything I want to redirect to host file constantly. Catching the response from example.com and replacing the contents of the response from example.com with example2.coms response seems to be the best in my mind that way the requester never knows it was changed.p
