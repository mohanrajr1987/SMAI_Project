Positive 50027 pI am creating custom phone book which reads phone book contacts and displays inside my application. So I am creating a long list selector and a listbox inside it. p  pMy listbox will contain phone contact name and list of phone number with the check box under the particular name. I wrote an event trigger inside my listbox to make track of the checkbox is clicked or not. p  pPROBLEM  Event is not firing in the view model.

Negative 50027 pI am writing a Silverlight client that interacts with an SQL database via ASP.NET 2.0 web services, which I am also developing. One of the services needs to return the results of a stored procedure and it works well. However, one parameter of the stored procedure needs to be retrieved from a different location before the stored procedure can be executed and this additional request to the database causes an obvious slowdown evident when I cache the retrieved value rather than obtaining it every call.p  pUnfortunately, caching the value isnt valid for my situation and Id rather combine the retrieval of this value and the subsequent stored procedure execution into a single query so that the the server can optimise the request. However, my SQL is not strong and I havent the faintest idea how I go about this.p  pThe value, lets call it codetasktypecode, is referenced via a single key, codeidcode. The stored procedure, codegetrecordscode, takes a few arguments including codetasktypecode, but it can be assumed that the other argument values are known at the time of calling the query. The stored procedure returns a table of records.p  pThanks for any help.p

Negative 50027 pI am relatively new to unittesting and TDD. Only more recently have I completed my first production application that has at least in theory 100 code coverage. I have done unittesting in previous projects as well for some time, but not in true TDD fashion and with good code coverage. It had always been an afterthought. I feel I have a pretty good grasp on it now though.p  pIm also trying to train the rest of the team on TDD and unit testing so that we can grow togeather and start moving forward with doing unit testing in all of our applications, and eventually progress to doing full TDD w automated builds amp continous integration. I posted a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1891466soineedtotraintheteamonunittestingcouldusecconlessonplana thread herea regarding my plan of attack  training agenda for comments amp critisism.p  pOne of the replies in fact the highest voted suggested I first setup infrastructure before I go forward with the training. Unfortunately I have no exposure to this, and googling on the topics is difficult because the pages for CruiseControl.NET  nAnt  etc do not really explain the why we should set this up and the how everything connects togeather. p  pWe are a small shop about 10 developers and use almost exclusively microsoft technologies and do our development in VB.NET. We are looking to eventually start using C but thats for another time. Ive been using the MSTest project that comes with VS2008 for my unit tests, and Ive been building my apps using Visual Studio, and deploying using MSI setup projects... We also unfortunately use VSS for our soure control  but that is also on the chopping block and Id really like to get rid of it and use subversion.p  pI know that I need to use CruiseControl.NET for CI, and either nAnt or MSBuild for building the applications. And I probably need a build server to run all these builds. But I just cant find anything that connects the dots and explains how they interact with eachother, what should be on your build server, when you should build with your build server is it just for deployment builds, or even when you just want to compile the app youre developing after making a small change, on your local environment. Im also planning on axing MSTest as Ive found it to be buggy and will use nUnit instead.p  pCan anyone perhaps illuminate this gap I have from knowing how to do TDD to setting up the proper infrastructure so the whole team can do it and work togeather I do understand what continous integration is, but again, Im not sure how a build server should be setup and how it connects with everything, and why we need one e.g. the pitch to management.p  pthanks very much for your time.p  pemstrongWhat portion of finalbuilder do I needemstrong It seems theres some overlap with final builder and teamcity.

Negative 50027 pIm trying to understand an example in the Kochan ObjC 2.0 book.  It looks like this.

Question 1  Also, by doing this, does resultFraction now have a reference count of 1  Or because it was never allocd and initd, is its reference count still 0p  pUsing the same Fraction class and methods, they show an example of how to calculate the summation of 12np  pHere is the codep  precodeFraction aFraction  [[Fraction alloc] init] Fraction sum  [[Fraction alloc] init], sum2 int i, n, pow2  [sum setTo 0 over1]  set 1st fraction to 0  NSLogEnter n scanfi, ampn  pow2  2 for i  1 i ltn i  [aFraction setTo 1 over pow2] sum2  [sum add aFraction] [sum release] sum  sum2 pow2 2  codepre  pIn this example, sum is allocd and initd, and added to aFraction, and the result is assigned to sum2, then sum is released.  So how is it in the next line sum  sum2, sum holds that value still  Cause doesnt sum now have a reference count of 0 after being released since it was only initialized once.  I thought sum2 would have the increased reference count and that would need to be relased after it gets assigned to sum.  p  pSorry for the noob questions.p

Something like value1value2value3value4...p  pAnyone has an idea how to accomplish thisp  pstrongEdit Some more backgroundstrong You probably wonder how im mapping the request to a controlleraction Well every request that isnt dispatchable thus isnt an existing controlleraction is handled by the error controller, it is there where i match the request URI against a path in the tree structure and thus am able to display the page if the path matches, if it doesnt match the error controller just continues and a 404 is responded.p

Negative 50027 pIm creating user controls that i will put into an update panel and make them visible only when required using triggers. Once visible it will float in a dialog box so it has a close button which will just hide the control on client side. p  pThe controls have multiple post back states, like a wizard, im using a multi view control to accomplish that. My problem is that once the user is at step number two in the control, if the user closes the dialog, than opens the dialog again, note that the control is made visible on the server and reloaded by updating the updatepanel the second step will still be displayed.  The reason is . because whenever there is a postback the control will load its state using the viewstate, even if EnableViewState is false it will still load it using the LoadControlState method. so my quesion is how can i force a user control to load fresh with its default values without any postback data.p

Negative 50027 pWe have a site and we developed a chat system for it using strophe.js library and ejabberd XMPP server. We use session attachment that was initiated with PHP using an inhouse library.

The said RID and SID is stored on a cookie and the RID value on the cookie is updated every update of the RID on strophe.js. This is so we can reuse the Session ID on page refreshnavigation to other places on the sitep  pWe now plan on having it work on multiple tabswindows. Ive observed Facebooks implementation, and for each tab there is a long polling request to a certain domain. This domain is different for each tab. For example, tab one would be 0.86.channel.facebook.com. Second tab would be 1.86.channel.facebook.com. As I understand this is to solve browser limitation of 2 active requests to a certain domain. How is this multiple domain solution implementedp  pNext would be on the chat sessions itself. The chat sessions would be different per tab right How would the UI be synched with each tab like Facebook My idea is, per every action, a message would be sent to the users own JID containing the action done related to chat.

Negative 50027 pI have some problems with maintaining scroll position after postback.

Negative 50027 pMy question is about a high performance way to implement autosaving in an ASP.NET 4.0 WebForms app.p  pstrongIve read a lot on using the various jQuery autosave plugins but they all seem to be best used for minimal input elements. And I havent found a solution that will populate the ASP.NET form again when the user returns to the form.strongp  pI have a FormView with a lot of elements, and a nested listview and formview. Using LinqDataSource to populate the FormView and its children.p  pWebserver is IIS 7. DB is SQL Server via Linq to SQL and I have access to MSMQ or any other server components required.p  pI have implemented autosaving using an UpdatePanel with form elements set to AutoPostBack, and a bit of custom javascript to force async requests to be sequential. This is to avoid concurrency errors in Linq to SQL. Each UpdatePanel async post back saves the entire form to a draft table in SQL Server. Its not very elegant but it does work  slowlyp  pThe problem is that the round trip is too slow. This causes form changes made during saving to not be saved, and also the form to jump back to the saved element, if the user has scrolled in the meantime.p  pSo Im now thinking I need top  ol liKeep the same method, populate the linq entity from the form and save it in MSMQ. I would then pull this out and persist it when the user Submits the form or maybe on Session End, or when they log in again next time orli liUse something like a hrefhttpsgithub.comnervetattoojqueryautosave relnofollowhttpsgithub.comnervetattoojqueryautosavea and save the serialized form data to MSMQ. This would be pretty fast, but the issue is that I am not sure how to put the data back in the ASP.NET form when the user returns to the form in subsequent sessions.li ol  pIve also thought about trying to save just the sending form input value on each post back. I could do this in a dictionary and maintain the dictionary in MSMQ.p  pBTW, I cant use the Cache or Session because I have to ensure that the form data is kept even if the user closes the browser. So I need something more robust.p  pVery interested in your opinions  all help greatly appreciatedp  pCheers..p

Negative 50027 pIs there any way that I can filter some properties of an extends class  For example I have thisp  precodepackage src      import flash.display.     import flash.display.MovieClip      public dynamic class code01 extends MovieClip        code codepre  pand then I just want codealphacode property and codescaleXcode and codescaleYcode and nothing else from codeMovieClipcode class. The reason is, if I have numbers of instance from this class, then my performance will not be interesting. So if I can filter unnecessary properties, then my performance will be better though.p

So kernellevel mechanisms arent necessarily efficient.p  pYou can think of it im still trying to assure you thats not a very stupid idea as of opposition fast usermode futexes vs. slow native mutexes, fast usermode green threads as in Erlang with up to 20 million simultanous processes on a machine vs. slower native threads etc.p

Can someone please take a look and see if you come up with something.p  precodefunction initialize          var myOptions               zoom 10,             mapTypeId google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP                  var canvas  document.getElementByIdMapCanvas         var map  new google.maps.Mapcanvas, myOptions           Try W3C Geolocation Preferred         if navigator.geolocation              browserSupportFlag  true             navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPositionfunction position                  initialLocation  new google.maps.LatLngposition.coords.latitude, position.coords.longitude                 map.setCenterinitialLocation                 marker  new google.maps.Marker                     position initialLocation,                     draggable true,                     map map,                     title You are here                                , function                   handleNoGeolocationbrowserSupportFlag                           Try Google Gears Geolocation          else if google.gears              browserSupportFlag  true             var geo  google.gears.factory.createbeta.geolocation             geo.getCurrentPositionfunction position                  initialLocation  new google.maps.LatLngposition.latitude, position.longitude                 map.setCenterinitialLocation                 marker  new google.maps.Marker                     position initialLocation,                     draggable true,                     map map,                     title You are here                                , function                   handleNoGeoLocationbrowserSupportFlag                           Browser doesnt support Geolocation          else              browserSupportFlag  false             handleNoGeolocationbrowserSupportFlag                     google.maps.event.addListenermarker, dragend, function               txtLat.valmarker.position.Ia             txtLong.valmarker.position.Ja                      codepre

How can I achieve telling the current user session to hold a parameter Writer ID, when the user selects a given writer preferably from the Writer datatable and use it to display only the records related to that selected writer row.p  pThe same way, when a user is done with the selected writer, heshe can reset the session to hold another writer ID and explore happily with the new selected writer child items.p  pIn other words, using codelthdatatables gtcode, and codeltfparam gtcode or something similar, how can I list Book, Evaluation and Topic items for a selected writer persistently. p  pemE.G Persistently for me means  When the user selects a writer from the datatable, and navigates to codebookList.xhtmlcode page, the book datatable must list only the book items that the selected writer has. And if the user navigates to somewhere else, he can see only whats related to the same writer.emp  pOne idea is to use OpenFaces datatable filters, but it is too cruel for the end user to filter the table each time heshe navigates to a page. He has to do it only once.  An exciting solution is to add an strongOpenFacesstrong filter codeltoinputTextFilter gtcode for each datatable codeltodatatable gtcode in that case and then all the filters for all tables get automatically the writer ID held as parameter by the user session during the JSF cycle. But is that really feasible  p  pSorry for the redundancy. Hope someone could help with hints, ideas, solutions or better alternative. regards.p

Negative 50027 pIn .Netp  p1 Do you let the exception propagate to the global error handler where you both log the error and show a msg box The reason I ask is if you use a single global error handler to catch exceptions at the top, youd need a bunch of Ifs to deduce the exception type and then show a message which may be friendly e.g. for filenotfound, the file you provided was not found, etc.p  pI have a global error handler in my winforms app. For any exceptions I cannot handle, they hit this handler where it logs the exception and displays a message  but this is the exception message, sometimes I may want something a little different depending on the audience etc.p  p2 I only catch exceptions I can handle. However, my application has a set of folders in a userselectable path. As the default share is locked down and audited etc, any missing files are rare and therefore an exceptional event. But when the user selects a location on his or her own pc, files can be missing, directory names too long, etc. I think this is a lot more common so dont wat to use exceptions here. But then earlier I mention I did. For this sort of conflict, is there an alternative way to structure my code without duplicationp  p3 Lastly, there are some exceptions which I cannot handle e.g. a file does not exist, this cannot be handled because the files are special format and only uploaded by certain IT staff. but this is rare. So for these exceptions in a method, I dont catch them. However, when someone looks at this despite the comment that this is caught at the global level, other developers shudder. Is this down to their ignorance p  pLasstly, what does it mean to unwind the stack tracep  pThanks p

Negative 50027 pSo here is the problem Im beating my head against  I have a custom user control that exposes two dependency properties that are bound to my ViewModel.  In my ViewModel I have an instance of a class that holds multiple properties that express values that relate to the user control as well as to items that control manipulates.  Heres a bit of sample code to explain it visually so here is a simple sample of my control, its a Slider that is combined with a checkbox that allows the user to lock the slider.p  precode    ltcustomSliderControl IsLockedBinding PathCustomClass.IsLocked, ModeTwoWay SliderValueBinding PathCustomClass.Value, ModeTwoWay gt codepre  pIsLocked and SliderValue are dependency properties that effectively manipulate the checkbox and slider that are contained in the custom control.  All of the control functions work as intended, except for the bindings to the class Ive defined.  If I create individual properties, as in one int property and one bool property the bindings work as intended.  However I have five sliders, and each slider in my actual code has five properties that tie in to them.  Im trying to eliminate code duplication by creating a class to hold these properties in a reusable object shrinking my 25 properties down to 5 class instances.p  pMy CustomClass inherits ObservableObject and has a bool property and int property named IsLocked and SliderValue respectively.  For more visual aids here is what it looks likep  precode    public class CustomClass  ObservableObject              public const string SliderValuePropertyName  SliderValue         private int sliderValue 0         public int SliderValue                      get                              return sliderValue                           set                              if sliderValue value                                      return                                    sliderValue value                 RaisePropertyChangedSliderValuePropertyName                             public const string IsCheckedPropertyName  IsChecked     private bool isChecked  false     public bool IsChecked              get                      return isChecked                   set                      if isChecked  value                              return                          isChecked  value             RaisePropertyChangedIsCheckedPropertyName               codepre  pThe ViewModel property is very similar and looks like this, an new instance of the class is created when the ViewModel loadsp  precode    public const string SliderOnePropertyName  SliderOne     private CustomClass sliderOne     public CustomClass SliderOne              get                      return sliderOne                   set                      if sliderOne value                              return                           sliderOne value             RaisePropertyChangedSliderOnePropertyName                codepre  pWhy wont the updating of the dependency property that is bound to the property in the class update properly  Is it because you cant properly update the class instance property by itself and instead have to update the entire class instance whenever changes occur  Or do I need to further customize the setter in this ViewModel property  As it sits now changing the slider value or checkbox never hits the bound property at all and nothing errors out when debugging.p  pEDIT  Ive also surrounded the control in a Border and set the Border UIElements DataContext to that of the class and then subsequently applied the more simple path binding to the underlying custom control.  This however did not have any effect on my problem.p  pIm a homegrown programmer so I often miss things when putting code together and Im guessing this is the case here, unless what Im trying just wont work. p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pEDIT  So Ive been toying around with using a custom event that will let me know when the specific property of the custom control changes and then having that event wired up in my ViewModel to update the existing class.  This works but still creates code duplication as now I have to have 10 events, 2 events per control, one to check for when the value of the slider changes and the other to detect when the checkbox IsChecked value changes.  This code duplication exists since you cant route multiple command parameters like a simple string identifier for which slider is being manipulated as well as the value you want to use in the code.  This limitation means I cant just use 2 events that differentiate between which control is undergoing changes within the defined method as exposing the physical control to the ViewModel breaks the MVVM pattern.  Using a class as the datacontext for the user control made it so I didnt care what control was being manipulated as they each had their own class instance.  Using events this unravels the MVVM pattern as now I need to know which of the five controls is being manipulated by the user.p  pIt cant be this hard to use a class in property bindings.  I have to be missing something remedial.p

Negative 50027 pThere are cases that a brute force approach on a problem has a complexity that is not good enough performancewise.  p  pLets take for example e.g. Thetan2.  p  pUsing a recursive approach it can be improved to Thetanlogn.  p  pObviously, asymptotically one would opt to use the recursive approach since for larger and larger input N the order of growth is lower i.e. better performance.  p  pMy question is the following  p  pIf asymptotically as N becomes larger and larger the recursivei.e. divide and conquer approach performs better, isnt it unrealistic to ignore that as we recurse on stronghugestrong inputs of N we could eventually run out of stackbr As a result for huge input we actually never get a result.  p  pSo how can we be sure that we choose the best algorithm for a specific problem if we ignore these details   p

Negative 50027 pSo I have several dedicated servers out there running Ubuntu Lucid server.  They primarily run WordPress sites  LAMP.  However, one of my original sites is a controls engineering site that uses MathTex to render the equations.p  pMathTex is pretty hard on servers.  The engineering site is still hosted on the original VPS which runs something like CentOS but thats irrelevant.  The traffic and numbers of renderings that MathTex creates cause resource issues with my VPS.  Ive been able to allocate more resources to the VPS but ultimately this gets expensive.  So Id like to offload the equation rendering to my dedicated servers all of which are much more powerful and underutilized.p  pSo Ive followed the instructions on installing and compiling MathTex.  And MathTex works fine from the command line.  However, when I attempt to call the script via my browser the browsers all try download the cgi file Ive tested on Firefox and Chrome on 2 machines.p  pThis led me to attempt to compile and install on my home Ubuntu box that is Ubuntu desktop.  The command line works fine.  However, again when calling the function in my browser it wanted to download the file instead of rendering an equation.  So I moved the mathtex.cgi script to codeusrlibcgibincode.  Still no go.  Then I changed codeusrlibcgibincode to 777 and it worked.  I changed codeusrlibcgibincode to 755 and it stopped working.p  pSo my home box works when codeusrlibcgibincode is 777.  I tried that one of my dedicated Ubuntu servers and still no go.

Negative 50027 pI took apples sample code tweeting and modified it so that it doesnt use ARC a hrefhttpdl.dropbox.comu1785075testTwitter.zip relnofollowdownload my project here to test the problem yourselfa. Actually only one autorelease statement was neededp  precode Set up the builtin twitter composition view controller. tweetViewController  [[[TWTweetComposeViewController alloc] init]autorelease]   Set the initial tweet text. See the framework for additional properties that can be set. [tweetViewController setInitialTextHello. This is a tweet.]   Create the completion handler block.

[self dismissModalViewControllerAnimatedNO]   ]   Present the tweet composition view controller modally. [self presentModalViewControllertweetViewController animatedYES] codepre  pIf you send the tweet or click cancel in tweetViewController you would expect that the tweetViewController is deallocated. Instead the object remains in memory including the attached image if you have attached one in the tweet . So, if the user tries to make another tweet the apps memory grows bigger because tweetViewController leaked.p  pAs you notice, tweetViewController  isnt mentioned inside the block so it isnt automatically retained.. p  pI used instruments and proved a hrefhttpdl.dropbox.comu1785075testTwitter.zip relnofollow1a that [[TWTweetComposeViewController alloc] init] causes a memory leak.p  pAnother thing I tried in order to prove it, was to  NSLog,tweetViewController  a few runcycles after the controller has been dismissed. Normally the program should have crashed because tweetViewController would not be pointing to a TWTweetComposeViewController instance. Instead it printed correctly the previous instance, proving the memory leak.p  pThe only way I have found in order to avoid this is by violating the memory management rules and is the followingp  precode[tweetViewController setCompletionHandlerTWTweetComposeViewControllerResult result        Dismiss the tweet composition view controller using animated YES     [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimatedYES]     [tweetViewController release]  ] codepre  pIf you dismiss it without animation, a memory leak occurs...

Negative 50027 pI have a very complex codeUITableViewCellcode subclass and I found in codeInstrumentscode that the code[super layoutSubviews]code call consumes 5 of running time while scrolling the table view. So I tried omitting the code[super layoutSubviews]code call since I do layout of all subviews myself. It did give me a performance boost. However, I found that without the code[super layoutSubviews]code call, interactive subviews like buttons dont receive touch events anymore.p  pSo my question is how can I omit code[super layoutSubviews]code call in my codeUITableViewCellcode subclass to gain the performance boost without breaking the touch events delivery to the subviewsp
Negative 50027 pIve seen all the parsing examples, but theyre all either using string or other random methods that wouldnt fix my problem. My problem is that, when I read from a text file, the tokens I extract come out with the token itself plus a bunch of random letters and symbols.  For example a line in the text file reads ... createdevice digitalcontroller Left Turn Lamp   51 ... and I want to be able to point to each token with my pointer array tklist[]. However when I parse and point, I get   ... createdevice ... Along with getting each other token in a similar fashion. Here is my code for extracting the tokens. Assume that my token positions are correct because Ive check and double checked that the positions are where they should be, otherwise I would only be getting part of the word I want included in the mess of characters. cline is declared as char cline[] and is the array of characters for a linep  precodetokenlength  endTokenPosition  startTokenPosition  length of the token  tklist[nexttoken]  char malloctokenlength  1    memcpytklist[nexttoken], ampcline[startTokenPosition], tokenlength  1   cout ltlt tklist[nexttoken] ltlt endl codepre

Negative 50027 pI am creating a customer ticketing portal, which uses OTRS as backend. The portal allow customers to create tickets and also upload attachments.p  pI have written a webservice using PHP and nuSOAP, that does the work of inserting the ticket details and attachment details in the appropriate OTRS tables ticket,tickethistory,article,articleattachment etc.  But since I am using webservice, i base64encode the attachment, before sending it as a parameter to my webservice method. And when i base64decode this content on the OTRS side, I cannot udnerstand for the life of me why it dsnt get inserted into the database. So I insert the content without decoding it. p  pAnd on my portal page, when I click to dowload the attachment, I base64decode the content before displaying the attachment.p  pIt all works fine for the customer portal, but when I try to download the attachment from the agent ticket zoom page in OTRS, it says the file format is not supported. Which is understandable, because the content is encoded and shld be decoded before downloading it.p  pWhat is the best way to troubleshoot this problem  Or how can I make OTRS base64decode the content before downloading the attachment p

Negative 50027 pWhile working on a Spring 3 MVC project using Hibernate, we encountered an annoying error. We are creating a carpool application. People can add routes using the Gmap 3 plugin for jQuery and can add waypoints to their route. In the database, a waypoint has a foreign key to a route. When trying to update a route addingremoving waypoints and resaving the route, we get the found two representations of the same collection error. Weve researched the Internet but mostly the topics talk about the Play framework we dont use that and furthermore they talk about annotations as mapping method while we use XML mappings. Does anyone have any idea how we can fix this Or is this a problem in Hibernate itselfp  pSome code to clarify the problemp  pXML mapping of the route classp  precodeltxml version1.0gt ltDOCTYPE

Negative 50027 pFirst timer here.p  pIve been writing an app thats intended to be deployed onto mobile platforms iOS and Android . This uses Flash Builder 4.6s android build target  it uses a subdirectory in the assets directory, that contains an arbitrary number of .png files. p  pI code a directory loader as suchp  precodepublic function LoadFromDirectorydirectoryNameString, storeVector.ltBitmapDatagtBoolean      Changed here this should work on both the development environment, AND the device.       Guess what...      imageDirectory  File.applicationDirectory.resolvePathassets directoryString      This is triggering on Android. Doesnt do so in ADL. Not tested on iOS yet,      but come on, if it doesnt work here, it wont work on iOS...      if imageDirectory.isDirectory                traceDirectory not found imageDirectory.url         return false           Snip loop through the contents of this directory, loading anything that is     a PNG and storing the bitmapData of all loaded PNGs into the vector, one by one     This of course, ALL works in ADL  codepre  pThis works in the air virtual devices, but isnt working on the mobile devices or on deployment. This is where Im stuck.p  pEdit Ok, Ive gone and reduced the File code to just one line. I should be using resolvePath for crossplatform compatibility also, the packager from Flash Builder doesnt see the assets subdirectory unless I put it inside bindebug, because thats where the compiled SWF went. p  pStill doesnt solve the problem tho  at least for the Android build, I can see the assets folder in the apk by renaming it to a .zip and extracting it all, and its the correct one alongside the apps XML files and the SWF. p  pThe apk installs and runs, but isDirectory still returns false when I debug on the device itself once again, not on ADL  on the device only. Commenting that entire if...segment will crash the app instead because well, it cant find the assets directory. p  pIm this close to solving the problem would appreciate if someone helped me with the final step, because its taking bloody ages to figure out. p  pPS I would love to simply just embed the images in a FLA or SWC which Ive done before and it works. Unfortunately, the number and name of images in that particular directory is emarbitraryem the only thing that Im certain of is the supported extensions.p  pPPS Usage of this function LoadImagesFromDirectoryimagesdirectory, which should look under appassetsimagesdirectory in any platform. The Boolean return is for debugging returns false if a directory with that name doesnt exist.p

When the class Node gets more functionality added to it e.g. more attributes, additional virtual and nonvirtual operations, we can cause a segmentation fault, rather than just incorrect output.  Were compiling the cpp code into a RedHat linux 64bit shared object library using g, and running the java code with the 64bit Server VM.  Note that on JVMs 1.6u20 through 1.6u22, this produces expected output.  I havent tried any earlier versions.p  pWeve decided to put a bounty on this question  Heres more information on what we already knowp  ul liJVMs 1.6u22 and prior produce expected resultsli liRenaming Node or putting it in a namespace produces expected resultsli liAllocating a Node object on the stack instead of the heap in the JNI function produces expected resultsli liThere are no issues with nonvirtual components of the class Nodeli ul  pUnfortunately for us, none of these items lead to viable solutions  the larger problem I alluded to was that were dealing with a large, existing code base with a C class named Node, which we need to access via JNI.  We also tried several g and javac compiler options, and several JVM options, to no avail although if someone stumbles on one that actually yields expected results, this would be an acceptable solution.p
Negative 50027 pSuppose I have a class codeanimalcode, with subclasses codehorsecode, codeduckcode, and coderabbitcode.  Suppose I use codemakeinstancecode to make several objects of class codeanimalcode.  Much later, I discover, for each of these objects, that its actually a codehorsecode, or a codeduckcode, or a coderabbitcode.  Is there a way to retype these objects  Simply creating new objects of the appropriate subtypes and copying over the data in all the slots, would be clumsy, because by this time such an object is already represented in lists which are in slots of yet other objects, and Id have to go through those lists and replace the old objects with the new ones.p  pKeep the same old objects and subclassify them.

First and foremost, GuthMD was correct in his assessment of parameters needing a reference in terms of either a boundfield, templatefield, or other source such as a control in the case of a control parameter.  Simply creating an codeaspboundfieldcode for the PaymentTermID and setting the codeVisiblecode property to false fixed the problem I posted about.p  pThe other problem was that the database was setup poorly, and had spaces in column names.  The OLEDB driver doesnt like that, and causes errors when you try to write back to the database and you have spaces in column names even if its encased in brackets [].  After fixing the names in SQL, then revisiting our code and rewriting most of the SQL code for it, things started behaving as expected.p  pThanks again for your help.p

Negative 50027 pWe have a C program that calls upon functions in a C dll for the real work. These functions have output parameters, and may throw an exception in case of problems. Throwing the exception over the interopbarrier seems to work fine. The problem we encounter is that, apparently, even when an exception occurs, the marshaler tries to retrieve the output parameters from the function. In some cases, these will not have a proper value due to the exception, which causes the process to crash, with an Access Violation in mscorlib.dll.p  pInitializing all output parameters to a valid value e.g. null before any work is done is of course a possibility. However, the penalty of forgetting one of these is severe.p  pIs our analysis, that the marshaler also runs when an exception is thrown, correct Is there a way to prevent thisp  pTIA.p

Negative 50027 pI am trying to use d3.js to display a treemap where a parents value may be greater than the sum of its children. For example, say I am visualizing lines of code in a namespace hierarchy. Namespace B and C are children of A and are 1 line each. Namespace A is 3 lines  1 line for B and C and 1 line for itself. Thus B and C alone do not dictate the size of A.p  pI want to display this property on the treemap. In particular, the parent should be a rectangle on top of the children rectangles whose size is correctly proportional. If the parent does not add any additional size, the parent should still be displayed but at minimal size maybe a tiny rectangle spanning the top of the children, just to indicate the parent name. p  pCurrently the children value nodes are just propagated up the hierarchy disregarding the actual size of nonleaf nodes. p  pI would like a solution in d3.js, because that is the library I am using in the rest of the code, but I am open to another framework if it solves the problem.p  pThank you.p

For example, a if a class looks like thisp  precodeclass Foo    def x  1   def getter      x      def getPropertyString name      this.name       foo  new Foo assert foo.getter  1 assert foo.x  2 codepre  pThese assert statements will work out because the getter method access x directly and the foo.x goes through getPropertyx which increments x before returning.p  pAfter some trial and error I can use an AST transformation to change the behavior of the code such that the expression x in the getter method is actually accessed as a Property rather than as a local field.  So far so goodp  pNow, how do I go about getting to ALL accesses of local fields in a given class  Ive been combing the internet looking for an AST tree walker helper of some kind but havent found one.  Do I really need to implement an expression walker for all 38 expression types here a hrefhttpgroovy.codehaus.orgapiorgcodehausgroovyastexprpackagesummary.html relnofollowhttpgroovy.codehaus.orgapiorgcodehausgroovyastexprpackagesummary.htmla and all 18 statement types here a hrefhttpgroovy.codehaus.orgapiorgcodehausgroovyaststmtpackagesummary.html relnofollowhttpgroovy.codehaus.orgapiorgcodehausgroovyaststmtpackagesummary.htmla  That seems like something that someone must have already written since it would be integral to building an AST tree in the first place but I cant seem to find it.p

Negative 50027 pI am writing a plugin using the jQuery UI Widget factory that wraps the dataTables plugin to add editing functions that are not available in the Editable plugin.p  pIn my plugin, I add two columns and buttons to the table headers, modify the codeaoColumncodes to define the new columns.

Negative 50027 pI have a rather general question regarding the recognition speed of any dictionary using a string as a key and couldnt find an answer so far.p  pWithin my current program I have a dictionary of custom objects but the keys I use are filenames including the whole path of the file such that no key can actually occur twice.p  pMy question is Does the time to find the specific object within the dictionary significantly depend on the length of the string used as a key Afterall, if I have a big amount of data saved within my object and I use that data in a loop and access the data every single time by using codemyDictionary[Key]code. The simple recognition might take a long time, making the loops last for a longer time.p  pMy solution to this problem would be In case of using an array, lets say codedouble[,,]code within my object, I temporarily create a new array and set this one equal to the one within the dictionary, so I dont have to search through the dictionary for every single loop iteration.p

Negative 50027 pI am working on a a hrefhttpmagentocommerce.com relnofollowMagentoa store SVN repo connected to Git utilizing the fabulous HTML5 Boilerplate based a hrefhttpsgithub.comaligentMagentoBoilerplate relnofollowMagentoBoilerplatea theme GitHub repo and extending it with my own child theme private Git Repo. These all exist in a single www folder which happens to be the top level directory for all three projects. I would like to cleanly integrate all of these into their respective repositories, but the only solutions for multiple repositories in a single directory that I have found are submodules which I love the idea of, but as far as I can tell require each project to be in a subfolder of the main Git repo and symlinking the files into place should work, but a bit messy and rather annoying to keep up.p  pIs there a clean way to get this done Here is an example of my folder structure. I have denoted in which repos each filedirectory resides  M  Magento, B  Boilerplate, P  Privatep  precodewww     app [M]         frontend [M]             base [M]             magentoboilerplate [B]                 default [B]                 myprivatetheme [P]     skin [M]         frontend [M]             base [M]             magentoboilerplate [B]                 default [B]                 myprivatetheme [P]     .htaccess [M][B][P]     favicon.ico [M][P] codepre  pAs you can see, even without the whole .htaccess and favicon.ico being in multiple repositories mess I would just gitignore or assumeunchanged them in the Magento and Boilerplate repos and use my private one for them the top level directory is www due to the way that Magento splits code and themes into separate folders with a common parent of www. Due to that you can even technically say that the app, skin, and various frontend folders exist in multiple repos as well, since they must exist in each repo all the way up to the top level directory for structure.p  pIs symlinking these repos in from separate folders my only solution Its not a huge problem, but I would be really interested to know if Git is flexible enough to deal with my case. It looks like a hrefhttpsgithub.comcolinmollenhourmodman relnofollowmodmana may have been created specifically to aid in this symlinking issue.p

Negative 50027 pI have a form on my website where a user enters an address of a place. When they submit the form, I convert this location into latitudelongitude and store this in a MySQL Database. I am using Googles Geocode service for this conversion. The problem is that I cant find either a class or a service to convert that latitudelongitude back to an address and as far as I know, Googles Geocode service is a unidirectional conversion. I realize I could store the physical address in the database, but over time this is wasted space when it could be stored in a simpler format. Does anybody know of either a classservice to convert from latitudelongitude to a address or if I am wrong and I can use Googles geocode system I have looked for the answer for the past few days but couldnt find anything.

Negative 50027 pI am migrating a project from struts 1.3 to struts 2.0. Now I have read through various resources available on web but could not find a struts 1.3 reset form method alternative in struts 2.0. My action class extends ActionSupport and implements Modeldriven. I have implemented the validate method in action class and that works perfect. However, when the form has no errors and the submission is done properly, the page reloads with initial values. I expected that I will receive a blank form. I looked for a reset form method but could find none. Currently, I am explicitly setting all form values to blank. I dont see this as a good prgramming practice. Please suggest how to implement form reset in struts 2.0p

Negative 50027 pAs I understand it in modern webdevelopment horizontally aligning elements side by side is by using float for example three column layout is achieved by floating two to one direction and one the other.  However this does bring out various problems and at the moment I am working on a website that require seperate columns in both header and content thus I need to float pretty much everything and set up various margins and widths to keep them from jumping all over the place.p  pWith HTML5 and CSS3 on the rise I am wondering whether there is something to replace floating with easier solution  As it is HTML5 and CSS3 introduce easier ways to make certain things happen like rounding corners with borderradius so one would think with multiple columns in a website being almost nonavoidable something to ease that hassle would be invented.p

I have reduced the relevant code to a a hrefhttpsgist.github.com4546068 relnofollowgista. The main issues arep  ul liPycrypto requires the input to be multiple of 16 in length, m2crypto does not.li liEven when the input length is multiple of 16, the ciphertext differs. After experimenting with M2Crypto cipher parameters, it turns out that setting codepaddingcode and codekeyasbytescode to false encrypts to the same ciphertext with  pycrypto.

Negative 50027 pFirst, I manage to implement a state machine in a single header file. I know I need some forward declarations, and I have to define the states from outside to inside. What I really dont understand is How would I do this with multiple filesp  pMy aproachp  ul liOne header per stateli liOne header with all possible states, forward declaredli lieach header which declares a state includes the header which declares its contextli ul  pThen it looks like thisp  precode forward.h struct Machine struct StA struct StB   machine.h include forward.h struct Machine  scstatemachinelt Machine, StA gt    a.h include forward.h  for StB include machine.h struct StA  scsimplestatelt StA, Machine, StB gt    b.h include forward.h include a.h struct StB  scsimplestatelt StB, StA gt  codepre  pNow its left open how to include the whole thing in the program. My idea was to have one header which includes from outside to inside all the states headers.p  precode themachine.h include forward.h include machine.h include a.h include b.h   use this header now where you need the state machine codepre  pHowever, I dont know if the general idea is ok and even if so, I cant get this to compile well, not emexactlyem this but a machine I built following this design principle.

Negative 50027 pI am using Flash Professional CS5.5 to make a design for a poster. I basically drew these little cards as a border. Inside of Flash I have everything laid out perfectly, and it looks fine. However, when I hit export as image or publish as image some of the suit symbols for the cards dont come out right. They either dont come out at all leaving the card blank or a black rectangle fills in their image. p  pI want to make each suit a movieclip so it is easier to make changes later, but it is best for this purpose to use movieclip or graphicp  pThis is a screenshot of the exported image opened up in preview.

Negative 50027 pI have 2 Rails 3.2.11 apps running on an Ubuntu 12.04 server with Nginx, Unicorn and Postgresql. Deployment is by git and capistrano. p  pAfter I installed the second app I found that Capistrano would  fail during cap deploy because it could not find a gem source and I needed to install each missing gem using sudo. After this, cap deploy worked fine and so did the apps. Running bundle install from the current dir in either app reported using all the correct gems.p  pI am perplexed that Capistrano needs to find the gems before updating my app as my past experience I think was that I could run bundle install from the current dir to install any new or updated gems after cap deploy. p  pToday, I decided to update my Ruby version using rbenv on my dev laptop. I needed to run git pull from .rbenvpluginsrubybuild and then rbenv rehash then I could install the new Ruby version. All good, rubyv reports the new version 19.3p374. p  pNow, when I run rails server rails s from my app dev dir I get rbenv rails command not found. The coderails command exists in these Ruby versions 1.9.3p327. rbenv version reports  1.9.3p374.

Negative 50027 pIm looking for a simple way to pull in additional commits after rebasing emorem a good reason to tell someone not to rebase.p  pEssentially we have a project, codecronscode.  I make changes to this frequently, and the maintainer of the project pulls in changes when I request it and rebases emevery timeem.p  pThis is usually okay, but it can lead to problems in two scenariosp  ul liReleasing from two branches simultaneouslyli liHaving to release an additional commit afterwards.li ul  pFor example, I commit revision code1000code.  Maintainer pulls and rebases to create revision code1000code, but at around the same time I realize a horrible mistake and create revision code1001code child of code1000code.  Since code1000code doesnt exist in the target branch, this creates an unusable merge, and the maintainer usually laughs at me and tells me to try again which requires me getting a fresh checkout of the main branch at code1000code and creating and importing a patch manually from the other checkout.  Im sure you can see how the same problem could occur with me trying to release from two separate branches simultaneously as well.p  pAnyway, once the main branch has code1000code, is there anything that can be done to pull in code1001code without having to merge the same changes again  Or does rebasing ruin this  Regardless is there anything I can say to get Maintainer to stop rebasing  Is he using it incorrectlyp

Negative 50027 pSo I am trying to get into simple animations and virtual physics and whatnot. I am trying to animate a ball so that it slowly grows as time passes by. The code I have here is pretty much exactly as it is in a Java For Dummies book I have with the exception of a few things such as getting rid of constants for the size of the applet this.setSize500, 500 vs this.setSizeWIDTH, HEIGHT and declaring WIDTH and HEIGHT earlier. The changes were simple and would not effect the program. I would know as Ive taken a Java course in school. Anyway, Im starting here with Applets and I cant get the program to run past two iterations. Down in the paint function I have a System.out.printlnd to check how many times the diameter of the ellipse grows. However the only output I see is 21 then 22. The applet continues to run via the applet viewer however nothing else is printed even though it should continue to grow.

Negative 50027 pemResolved April 15, 2013.em  In windows 7 64bit windows explorer when I right clicked a Python file and selected edit with IDLE the editor opens properly but when I run or f5 the Python 3.3.1 program, it fails with the strongemIDLEs subprocess didnt make connection.  Either IDLE cant start a subprocess or personal firewall software is blocking the connection.emstrong error message.  All other methods of starting IDLE for running my python 3.3.1 programs worked perfectly.  Even the Send to method worked but it was unacceptably clunky.  Ive spend four days so far researching this and trying various things including reinstalling Python many times.  And NO its not the FireWall blocking it.  Ive tried totally turning Firewall off and it had no effect.p  pHeres an important clue In the beginning I installed and configured python 3.3 64 bit and strongeverythingstrong worked including running from edit with IDLE but then recently when I needed a library only available in Python 2 I installed python 2.7.4 and from that point on the stated problem began. At one point I completely removed all traces of both versions and reinstalled Python 3.3.1 64 bit. Problem remained.p  pThen I tried have both strong32 bitstrong versions installed but still no luck. Then at some point in my muddling around I lost the option to edit with IDLE and spent a day trying everything including editing in Regedit.  No luck there either. I reinstalled Python 3.3.1 still no edit with IDLE then Finally I uninstalled all versions of Python and I removed python references to environment variables PATH and PYTHONPATH. Then I Deleted all the Python related keys in the windows registry, deleted the Cpython33 directory that the uninstall didnt bother to delete. Overkill, of course, then I restarted windows and installed Python 3.3.1 64 bit version again and thankfully the option to edit with IDLE was back. I was emmomentarilyem happy, I opened windows explorer, right clicked on a python program, selected edit with IDLE selected RUN eyes closed and you guessed it, same original error message  strongIDLEs subprocess didnt make connection. Either IDLE cant start a subprocess or personal firewall software is blocking the connection.strongp  pI am completely stuck on this issue and really need help. Pretty sure that you can see I and not a happy camper. And to top it all off, I guess I dont understand StackOverflow yet, I have had this plea for help up in various versions for 5 days and not one response from anyone.  Believe me Ive looked at every thing in stackoverflow plus other sites and I cant see the answer. Almost seems like I have to answer my own question and post it, trouble is, so far I cant.  p  pAnyway, thanks for listening.  Yes Im pretty new to Python but Ive been programming and overcoming problems for many years too many perhaps.  anyone Not personally having someone that is familiar with Python makes this difficult, how can I get in touch with an expert in Python for a quick phone conversation p

Negative 50027 pIm trying to figure out how can I make sure that the event has fired before letting the rest of the code run.p  pI hook up an event like thisp  precodepublic static class ServiceUrlQueryParameters        public static void ServiceUrlQueryParameters                  ...            dynamicMapServiceLayer.Initialized  new EventHandlerltEventArgsgtDynamicMapServiceLayerQueryInitialized            ...         codepre  pSo now, the code has attached a listener to the event and will wait until the event fires. But I dont want anything else in that class to happen until that event has fired because that map service layer initialization brings sets up the info that the next lines of code need. The code in the rest of the application and the GUI should continue to run, though.p  pI used to have the rest of the code in the event handling listener method like this.p  precodeprivate void DynamicMapServiceLayerInitializedobject sender, System.EventArgs evArgs       Query query  GetParameterQuery     QueryTask queryTask  new QueryTaskGetRestURLdynMapServLayer    queryTask.ExecuteCompleted  GraphicQueryTaskExecuteCompleted     ...     queryTask.ExecuteAsyncquery    codepre  pBut that doesnt make sense because executing a query is not semantically related to a service layer getting initialized. Putting  query code in an event handler method that runs when a map layer is initialized doesnt seem t logical to me. So, now I have it like thisp  precodepublic static class ServiceUrlQueryParameters        public static void ServiceUrlQueryParameters                    No more Initialized event hookup to any event handling listener                 public static void QueryUrlParameters              if   dynMapServLayer.IsInitialized                      return                   Query query  GetParameterQuery         QueryTask queryTask  new QueryTaskGetRestURLdynMapServLayer         queryTask.ExecuteCompleted  GraphicQueryTaskExecuteCompleted         queryTask.Failed  QueryTaskFailed         queryTask.ExecuteAsyncquery          codepre  pBut that is not such a great idea because when the QueryUrlParameters is called, the Initialized event still might not have fired and maybe it never will.p

Negative 50027 pIm working through my first major XSLT project, and am a bit of a novice, so please be patient with my ignorance.p  pOur group is working on a transform of existing XMLs to an entirely different tagging system. I have devised a system of processing the MathType callouts signified by TEXT  using AnalyzeString, but Im having difficulty determining what I should do with code like the ital tags signified by the I tags, which need to be kept in the result code.p  pI tried using copyof in the nonmatchingsubstring, but that appears to not work. Of course, valueof gets me everything except the ital tags.p  pI realize the variable stemString is superfluous at this point.

Negative 50027 pI have a html file that contains a input box to enter a first name. On click this runs through a JavaScript function that loads an XML file to see if there are any matches. If there are matches, they are to be displayed in a table with the matching contact information. I can do this fine.p  pBut I am required to also show an alert if there is no match. That is If the Contact Does not Exist.p  pNow, the for loop in my code messes innerHTML up, which is fair enough, it loops that particular code over and over again and so any code inside is parsed.

It also allows for implementing specific creation algorithms for different types without having to change the factory class. There is a major problem with this pattern though. The class AFactory is never used explicitly. It registers its creator function at load time through CRTPFactorys member temp. This might be a little complicated to understand but its very easy to use. The problem is AFactory isnt compiled so its static parameters arent initialized at load time. My question is, is it possible to force the compiler Im using VS 2012 but answers for GCC are also good to compile AFactory without ever explicitly creating an instance of it  A solution that I use in VS is to dllexport AFactory, that way the compiler compiles the class even though it doesnt know of anyone instantiating it. This is because it assumes some other dll might instantiate it. The problem with this solution is that the factory class must be implemented in a separate dll as the rest of the code. And also this doesnt work on GCC.p

Negative 50027 pI have built a slide navigation controller which allows the sliding of UIViewControllers in a fast and smooth way Facebook style. I have since added a UIViewController with a child view controller with its own child view controller, as well as a table view. The lowest child view controller also has a view subviews. This UIViewController has the view that is made visible when the top view is slid away.p  pI have tested the smoothness both with and without this view controller. Without it the slide runs at a nice 60 frames per second, but with it my device is only managing a choppy 20 to 30 fps.p  pI have also tried removing subviews which seems to make a slight improvement, but not as much as I would expect. Even when switched out with another fairly complex view controller without child view controls though I get much better performance.p  pI am using auto layout throughout the app, and have come to believe this is the problem. None of my code is being executed whilst this poor sliding is occurring, so I believe it has something to do with the constraints being calculated as more of the view is being shown, but cant be sure.p  pAs to avoid including the whole class, here are the updateViewConstraint methods in the view controller and subviewsp  pstrongTOP VIEW CONTROLLERstrongp  precode    Called when the view

If I dont send these frames over to the client, the client will not freeze. But some the frames would be broken.

Negative 50027 pSo I am writing a program that animates the insertion sort algorithm using a line graph type thing. The way it is written now, it will generate a random array of integers and draw according representitive lines a DrawingPanel when the populate button is clicked, and when the pause button is hit, it freezes for like 5 seconds then shows the graph sorted. I want to show each iteration, showing one line at a time moving. Any suggestions. I am really not sure how to work multithreading in Java, I am pretty new. I would appreciate any suggestions.p  precodeimport java.awt. import java.awt.event. import java.util.ArrayList import javax.swing. import java.util.Random import java.util.Arrays  public class AnimationApplication extends JFrame   private static final long serialVersionUID  1L  AnimationPanel panel1  new AnimationPanel AnimationPanel panel2  new AnimationPanel  public static void mainString[] args      AnimationApplication prog  new       AnimationApplicationAnimation Application      prog.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE     prog.setSize450, 300     prog.setVisibletrue   AnimationApplicationString title      supertitle      setLayoutnew BorderLayout      addpanel1, BorderLayout.WEST     addpanel2, BorderLayout.EAST    class AnimationPanel extends JPanel implements ActionListener, Runnable   private static final long serialVersionUID  1L  private int currentSize  private JButton populate  new JButtonPopulate Array private JButton pauseB  new JButtonPause private JButton stopB  new JButtonStop private DrawingPanel drawingCanvas  new DrawingPanel  private volatile Thread animator  null private volatile boolean animationSuspended  false  ArrayListltIntegergt pointList  new ArrayListltIntegergt  private Integer [] rndInts  AnimationPanel      setLayoutnew BorderLayout      JPanel buttonP  new JPanelnew GridLayout1, 3, 5, 5     buttonP.addpopulate     buttonP.addpauseB     buttonP.addstopB      populate.addActionListenerthis     pauseB.addActionListenerthis     stopB.addActionListenerthis      adddrawingCanvas, BorderLayout.CENTER     addbuttonP, BorderLayout.SOUTH   public void actionPerformedActionEvent e       if e.getSource  populate                           rndInts  new Integer[ getSize.width1]                           forint i  0 i lt rndInts.length i        Random rand  new Random     rndInts[i]rand.nextIntgetSize.height1     System.out.printlnrndInts[i]       currentSize  rndInts.length                        pointList  new ArrayListltIntegergtArrays.asListrndInts                            System.out.printlnStart button pressed           Check if no animation thread exists         if animator  null                If not, start the animation             start            else               If animation is paused, resume it             if animationSuspended                  resume                             else if e.getSource  pauseB          insertionSortrndInts , currentSize          Check if animation thread exists         if animator  null                If so, suspend the animation thread             animationSuspended  true                else if e.getSource  stopB          stop         clear         public void run       Thread thisThread  Thread.currentThread      drawingCanvas.repaint     while animator  thisThread          System.out.printlnAnimation thread running       drawingCanvas.repaint         try              Thread.sleep1  drawingCanvas.repaint             if animationSuspended                  synchronized this                      while animationSuspended ampamp animator  thisThread                          drawingCanvas.repaint                         wait                         drawingCanvas.repaint                                                             catch InterruptedException e              break                    Repaint the panel         drawingCanvas.repaint         public void start  drawingCanvas.repaint      Create a new animation thread and start it     animator  new Threadthis     animationSuspended  false     animator.start     animationSuspended  true       public synchronized void stop      drawingCanvas.repaint     animator  null     notify   public synchronized void resume      animationSuspended  false     notify   public void clear      pointList.clear     repaint    void insertionSortInteger [] arr, int length     int i, j, tmp   for i  1 i lt length i           j  i         while j gt 0 ampamp arr[j  1] gt arr[j]                 tmp  arr[j]               arr[j]  arr[j  1]               arr[j  1]  tmp               j               stop               drawingCanvas.repaint               start               resume                  class DrawingPanel extends JPanel implements Runnable       private static final long serialVersionUID  1L      protected void paintComponentGraphics g                Call superclass version of method         super.paintComponentg          this.setBackgroundColor.WHITE          clear the background         g.clearRect0, 0, getSize.width1, getSize.height1          g.setColorColor.RED             Draw points         for int i  0 i lt currentSize  i pointList.size i                     g.drawLinei, getSize.height, i, rndInts[i]           repaint             resume                         codepre

Negative 50027 pI have two scatterplots, based on different but related data, created using qplot from ggplot2. Learning codeggplotcode hasnt been a priority because codeqplotcode has been sufficient for my needs up to now. What I want to do is superimposeoverlay the two charts so that the x,y data for each is plotted in the same plot space. The complication is that I want each plot to retain its formattingaesthetics. p  pThat data in question are row and column scores from correspondence analysis  codecorrespcode from codeMASScode  so the number of data rows i.e. samples or taxa differ between the two datasets. I can plot the two score sets together easily. Either by combing the two datasets or, even easier, just using the codebiplotcode function. p  pHowever, I have been using qplot to get the plots looking exactly as I need them with samples plotted as colourcoded symbols and taxa as labelsp  precodePlotSample lt qplotDataCorresprscore[,1], DataCorresprscore[,2],                      colourfactorDataAllColourCode     scalecolourmanualvalues  cblack,darkgoldenrod2,                                  deepskyblue2,deeppink2 codepre  pandp  precodePlotTaxa lt qplotDataCorrespcscore[,1], DataCorrespcscore[,2],                    labelcolnamesDataCorresp, size10, geomtext codepre  pCan anyone suggest a way by which eitherp  ul lithe two plots codePlotSamplecode and codePlotTaxacode can be superimposed atop of each other, li lithe two datasets codeDataCorresprscorecode and codeDataCorrespcscorecode can be plotted together but formatted in their different ways, or li lianother function e.g. codebiplotcode that could be used to achieve my aim.li ul  pExample of workflow using a extremely simplified and madeup datasetp  precodegt requireMASS gt requireggplot2 gt alldataltread.csvFake data.csv,headerT,row.name1 gt selectdataltalldata[,210] gt alldata           Period Species.1 Species.2 Species.3 Species.4 Species.5 Species.6 Sample1   Early        50        87        97        12        60        49 Sample2   Early        41        90        36        52        36        27 Sample3   Early        87        56        82        45        56        13 Sample4   Early        37        47        78        29        53        34 Sample5   Early        58        70        34        35         8        21 Sample6   Early        94        82        48        16        27        26 Sample7   Early        91        69        50        57        24        13 Sample8   Early        63        38        86        20        28        11 Sample9  Middle         4        19        55        99        86        38 Sample10 Middle        29        25        10        93        37        54 Sample11 Middle        48        12        59        73        39        92 Sample12 Middle        31         6        34        81        39        54 Sample13 Middle        29        40        26        52        34        84 Sample14 Middle         1        46        15        97        67        41 Sample15   Late        43        47        30        18        60        23 Sample16   Late        45        10        49         2         2        45 Sample17   Late        14         8        51        36        58        51 Sample18   Late        41        51        32        47        23        43 Sample19   Late        43        17         6        54         4        12 Sample20   Late        20        25         1        29        35         2           Species.7 Species.8 Species.9 Sample1         41        39        57 Sample2         59         4        45 Sample3         10        56         5 Sample4         59        30        39 Sample5          9        29        57 Sample6         29        24        35 Sample7         22         4        42 Sample8         31        19        40 Sample9         17         7        57 Sample10         6         9        29 Sample11        34        20         0 Sample12        56        41        59 Sample13         6        31        13 Sample14        25        12        28 Sample15        60        75        84 Sample16        32        69        34 Sample17        48        53        56 Sample18        80        86        46 Sample19        50        70        82 Sample20        57        84        70 gt biplotselectca,cexc0.6,0.6 gt selectcaltcorrespselectdata,nf5 gt PlotSample lt qplotselectcarscore[,1], selectcarscore[,2], colourfactoralldataPeriod  gt PlotTaxaltqplotselectcacscore[,1], selectcacscore[,2], labelcolnamesselectdata, size10, geomtext  codepre  pThe biplot will produce this plot r10wk1a85p  pThe PlotSample appears as such ri29cba5p  pThe PlotTaxa appears as such r245bl9d5p  pEDIT so dont have enough rep to post pictures and tinypic links not accepted despite a hrefhttpmeta.stackexchange.comquestions60563howtouploadimagesonstackoverflowhttpmeta.stackexchange.comquestions60563howtouploadimagesonstackoverflowa.

Negative 50027 pI am currently building a Windows Store App that uses cryptography. This means extensive use of the codeCryptographicBuffercode class. The app is very securitysensitive, so I would like to make sure to Zeroize any codeBuffercodes immediately after use. I am doing the same thing with codebyte[]codes when I use them.p  pTo Zeroize them, currently wed like top  ul liWrite all 1s.li liWrite a pattern. Currently using 0,1,2,...254,255,0,1...li liWrite all 0s.li ul  pThe solution I have come up with is to create an extension method for each of codeIBuffercode and codebyte[]code which will do this for me. For codebyte[]code I believe its pretty straightforwardp  precodepublic static void Zeroizethis byte[] bytes      for int i  0 i lt bytes.Length i               bytes[i]  255          for int i  0 i lt bytes.Length i              bytes[i]  bytei  255           for int i  0 i lt bytes.Length i              bytes[i]  0       codepre  pFor codeIBuffercode, its a little bit more difficult, in that you dont seem to get direct access to the codeBuffercode. Through codeSystem.Runtime.InteropServices.WindowsRuntimecode you do seem to get a few useful methods, such as codeIBuffer.CopyTocode and codeIBuffer.AsStreamcode, which give you direct access to the codeBuffercode or underlying codeStreamcode. The solution I have come up with is thisp  precodepublic static void Zeroizethis IBuffer buffer      var capacity  buffer.Capacity     byte[] toWrite  new byte[capacity]     for int i  0 i lt capacity i              toWrite[i]  255           toWrite.AsBuffer.CopyTobuffer      for int i  0 i lt capacity i              toWrite[i]  bytei  255           toWrite.AsBuffer.CopyTobuffer      for int i  0 i lt capacity i                  toWrite[i]  0           toWrite.AsBuffer.CopyTobuffer  codepre  pMy questions are thus Is there a better way to be doing this Is there any other hidden methods codeInteropServicescode isnt really advertised all that well that would make this a bit easiermore efficientmore securep  pNote I realize the Zeroization process may be overkill, but it is requested by the Owner.p

If it is not, I get obviously an error codeundefined referencecode. This is why I want to declare it weak with codeattributeweakcode from GCC or with codepragma weakcode. For some reason to long to explain here I want to do this in a seperate CFile, without adding the codepragmacodecodeattributecode to the original declaration  Is there anyway to do this If I just add codepragma weak foocode to anothr CFile it wont work.  I am using GCC 4.8.1 p  pedit as requested some code Note The implementation of codefoocode is strongnotstrong linked to the projectp  pFunction.cp  precodeextern void foovoid  pragma weak foo    lt If I add it here, it links without problems  void barvoid       foo  codepre  pWeakDeclaration.cp  precodepragma weak foo lt If I add it here, I get undefined reference error codepre  pstrongedit2strongp  pOk I gonna try so specify my question a bit more  is there any way to make the symbol codefoocode globally visible to the linker with the attribute codeweakcode from within another CFile codeWeakDeclaration.ccodep

Negative 50027 pthis is for my NXT brick.p  pLets say I have two DIFFERENT classes, Class codeAcode and Class codeBcode, and each class has its OWN thread running.p  pHowever, there is a static variable instance called codeMotorAcode that is shared by both classes. This codeMotorAcode variable is a PHYSICAL motor whose motion can be controlled by the two classes. Both Class codeAcode and Class codeBcodes threads can control codeMotorAcodes motion but I only want ONE of them to control codeMotorAcode at a time.p  pFor example, if Class codeAcode is trying to rotate codeMotorAcode forward and Class codeBcode is trying to rotate codeMotorAcode backward, I only want Class codeAcode to rotate codeMotorAcode forward and block Class Bs effect.p  pQuestion Can I use the SAME lock to synchronize methods in threads from DIFFERENT classesp

Negative 50027 pIn a library using Monitor.PulseAll for thread synchronization, I noticed that the latency from the time PulseAll... is called to the time a thread is woken up seems to follow a stepping stair distribution  with extremely large steps.  The woken threads are doing almost no work and almost immediately go back to waiting on the monitor.  For example, on a box with 12 cores with 24 threads waiting on a Monitor 2x Xeon5680Gulftown 6 physical cores per processor HT Disabled, the latency between the Pulse and a Thread waking up is as suchp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comppO9W.png altLatency using Monitor.PulseAll 3rd party libraryp  pThe first 12 threads note we have 12 cores take between 30 and 60 microseconds to respond.

When the event is triggered, they take a latency measurement then immediately wait on their own individual perthread AutoResetEvent.  Well before the next iteration 500ms before, the ManualResetEvent is Reset and then each AutoResetEvent is Set so the threads can go back to waiting on the shared ManualResetEvent.p  pI hesitated posting this because it could be a giant red hearing I make no claims Events and Monitors behave similarly plus its using some absolutely terrible practices to get an Event to behave like a Monitor Id lovehate to see what my coworkers would do if I submitted this to a code review but I think the results are enlightening.p  pThis test was done on the same machine as the original test a 2xXeon5680Gulftown 6 cores per processor 12 cores total Hyperthreading disabled.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLLrQQ.png altManualResetEventLatencyp  pIf its not obvious how radically different this is than Monitor.PulseAll here is the first graph overlaid onto the last graphp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2CLG2.png altManualResetEventLatency vs. Monitor Latencyp  pThe code used to generate these measurements is belowp  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Linq using System.Text using System.Threading using System.Threading.Tasks using System.Collections.Concurrent using System.Diagnostics  namespace MRETest      class Program              static long LastTimestamp         static long Iteration         static ManualResetEventSlim MRES  new ManualResetEventSlimfalse         static ListltReadLastTimestampAndPublishgt Publishers               new ListltReadLastTimestampAndPublishgt         static Stopwatch s  new Stopwatch         static ConcurrentBagltTupleltlong, longgtgt IterationToTicks               new ConcurrentBagltTupleltlong, longgtgt          static void Mainstring[] args                      long numThreads  24             s.Start              for int i  0 i lt numThreads i                              AutoResetEvent ares  new AutoResetEventfalse                 ReadLastTimestampAndPublish spinner  new ReadLastTimestampAndPublish                     new AutoResetEventfalse                 Task.Factory.StartNewspinner.Spin, TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning                 Publishers.Addspinner                           for int i  0 i lt 20 i                              Iteration                 LastTimestamp  s.Elapsed.Ticks                 MRES.Set                 Thread.Sleep500                 MRES.Reset                 foreach ReadLastTimestampAndPublish publisher in Publishers                                      publisher.ARES.Set                                  Thread.Sleep500                           Console.WriteLineString.Joinn,                 from n in IterationToTicks where n.Item1  10 orderby n.Item2                     select decimaln.Item2  TimeSpan.TicksPerMillisecond             Console.Read                   class ReadLastTimestampAndPublish                      public AutoResetEvent ARES  get private set               public ReadLastTimestampAndPublishAutoResetEvent ares                              this.ARES  ares                           public void Spin                              while true                                      MRES.Wait                     IterationToTicks.AddTuple.CreateIteration, s.Elapsed.Ticks  LastTimestamp                     ARES.WaitOne                                              codepre

Negative 50027 pI have a toplevel folder which acts as a codeworkspacecode, so it contains all my codeprojectscode.p  pHere, by codeprojectcode, I mean a standalone codeappcode, nothing else. So the codeworkspacecode contains multiple separate codeappscode, not linked by any means.p  pA codeprojectcode can have a single codemodulecode, or multiple codemodulescode if needed I have projects of both types.p  pThe problem is that, when I tried today to import a codeprojectcode, it not only imported the one I wanted, it also imported along with it, another 2 projects from the same codeworkspacecode... into the same project layout in AS. So now I have 3 codeappscode showing up as the same codeprojectcode. Thats not cool. I presume AS mistakenly thought the other 2 codeprojectscode were codemodulescode related to the project I selected initially.p  pI also want to add the fact that the import succeeded on another computer. Ive also tried invalidating the AS cache and restarting it. Same problem.p  pIf you dont have a solution for importing ONLY the project I need though this would be great, at least can somebody give me a solution for deleting the other 2 projects  I have a delete option on them, but apparently it deletes them from disk as well.p

Negative 50027 pI have created a workflow system where users can see their work in a queue, mark it complete, and create an outgoing correspondence letter. In the Access DB, essentially they are going into each record which has an Incomplete indicator and marking items as Complete from the queue table.  After doing this, an insert is triggered, which inserts customer data based on that record being marked into a letter table.  A pdf is then batchedprinted based on the inserted data from this letter table.p  pThe beginning scope of the project was a single transaction type with essentially limited data fields Such as Name, Address, State, Zip.  I am finding now that I am being asked to expand the transaction types in the queue.  Different letters however, require different fields and not all fields are readily available for each letter Some letters need and have an account issued date, others do not, etc.p  pMy question pertains to the methodology of expanding the fields available for letter insert.  I need to add more fields for the new transaction types in the letter table.  But these fields are transaction specific, so for example, I may have some kind of audit letter that does not use account premiums, but now I have another transaction that uses only account premiums.  All my letters in the table will share that field if I create it, regardless of whether they actually use it or not. So if that is the case, how should I deal with the nulls I am wondering if I should still create the field aptly named such as AccountPremium, or should i use generic names like extraField1 and just match it to the point in the letter  p

This leads to unnecessary loadings and speed loss.p  pWhat if I let the codesrccode value empty, that add the correct url into it I would like to stay seo optimized, so an empty src maybe not a good idea. Can I achieve this without double downloading images Maybe I should use an event before the browser begins the download the codesrccode data.p  pMy codep  precode.image.loadfunction       if this.hasClassoptimized          this.attrsrc, imageperfection.phpimage  encodeURIComponentthis.attrsrc  ampwidth  this.width         this.addClassoptimized       codepre

Negative 50027 pIm creating PDFs with iText LGPL which include some Text and selfdrawn Graphics2D images.  p  pMy current solution is to draw the images on a BufferedImage and then include it in the PDF, which has several drawbacksbr If printed, the images just look ugly, a way to circumvent this is to use larger images, and with 30003000 it looks ok. But this leads to the next problem time. It takes several seconds to compress one image I havent found a way to disable it, and files would be huge without compression.p  pPdfGraphics2d from iText looks good, but has one major drawback its only able to draw to the background of the PDF, and there seems to be no way to wrap it in some kind of element. p  pIs there a way to draw on a PDF without having to use absolute positions Im using Graphics2d because its used also to provide a preview in the UI.p

Negative 50027 pI need some help to understand the basics of concurrent programming. In fact, the more I read and the more Im getting confused. So, I understood that a process is an instance of a program that is being executed  sequentially and that it can consist of one or more threads. In a single core CPU, only one thread can be executed at once, while in a multicore CPU, many thread can run concurrently. Now the questions arep  p1 How many threads and processes can be run concurrently with a, for example, quadcore CPU Only four threads at the same time and only 1 processp  p2 Is the parallelism possible only for threads and not for processes For example, if Im running three different applications processes on a threecore CPU, like a browser web, a word processor and a calculator, can they use just a core for each and run concurrentlyp  p3 In many books, you can find the explanation of three states runnable, blocked and running. Do they refer to processes or threads or both I dont understand. Thank you. p

Does anyone know of a better way to do this I should mention that removing objects in constant time is a requirement.p  pIt does mean that client code looks likep  precodevar myList  new LinkedList  var a  new Something var b  new SomethingElse  myList.addTaila myList.addTailb  myList.removea myList.removeb codepre  pwhich is nice and readable, but the insertion of properties into the objects which might clash with existing properties is shaky, to say the least although it can be documented and the property name prefix could be passed in to the LinkedList constructor.p  pThis is the LinkedList codep  precodevar LinkedList  function       var id  0      var Node  functionobj, p, n          this.item  obj         this.prev  p         this.next  n           var list  function          this.length  0         this.nodeName    id  lnn         this.root  new Nodenull         this.root.next  this.root         this.root.prev  this.root           list.prototype            insertBefore  functionobj, item              var node  new Nodeitem, obj.prev, obj             obj.prev.next  node             obj.prev  node             item[this.nodeName]  node             this.length         ,          insertAfter  functionobj, item              var node  new Nodeitem, obj, obj.next             obj.next.prev  node             obj.next  node             item[this.nodeName]  node             this.length         ,          addTail  functionitem              this.insertBeforethis.root, item         ,          addHead  functionitem              this.insertAfterthis.root, item         ,          remove  functionitem              var node  item[this.nodeName]             node.prev.next  node.next             node.next.prev  node.prev             delete node.item[this.nodeName]             this.length         ,          popHead  function              ifthis.length gt 0                  var node  this.root.next                 node.prev.next  node.next                 node.next.prev  node.prev                 delete node.item[this.nodeName]                 this.length                 return node.item                          return null         ,          popTail  function              ifthis.length gt 0                  var node  this.root.prev                 node.prev.next  node.next                 node.next.prev  node.prev                 delete node.item[this.nodeName]                 this.length                 return node.item                          return null         ,          forEach  functioncallback, context              var node  this.root.next             var index  0             whilenode  this.root                  var next  node.next                 ifcallback.callcontext, node.item, index  false                      return false                                  node  next                 index                          return true         ,          removeIf  functioncallback, context              var node  this.root.next             whilenode  this.root                  var next  node.next                 ifcallback.callcontext, node.item  true                      node.prev.next  next                     node.next.prev  node.prev                     delete node.item[this.nodeName]                     this.length                                  node  next                      ,          toString  function              var s  this.length.toString             var sep  lt             this.forEachfunctioni, index                  s  sep  i.toString                 sep  ,                          return s  gt                    return list  codepre
Negative 50027 pIve been getting intermittent errors compiling a vertex shader, preparing for the first render of a newly created OpenGL context. Its the same vertex shader that usually works, on the same hardware. After the failure, the info log returned by codeglGetShaderInfoLogcode usually shows thisp  precodeVertex shader failed to compile with the following errors codepre  pYes, thats the whole thing. It happens on Windows, with both ATI and NVidia GPUs, though Ive mostly been testing on ATI.  If Im running under the Visual Studio debugger, an access violation may be detected in codeglCompileShadercode or in the subsequent codeglGetShaderivcode call.p  pI havent seen the bug on the Mac, but since its not always easy to reproduce it, Im not absolutely sure it doesnt happen.p  pI have noticed that if I dont call codewglShareListscode when I create my contexts, the error goes away or at least I cant reproduce it easily.  I take that to mean that some bad information is bleeding through from a previously created and perhaps previously destroyed OpenGL context to the new one.  However, Ive been trimming out stuff until there is not much that should be shared No texture objects, display lists, VBOs, PBOs. The only things left that would be shared, as far as I know, would be shader and program objects.p  pAfter creating an OpenGL context for a window, I initialize shading roughly like thisp  precode Program initialization GLint vertexShader  glCreateShader GLVERTEXSHADER  glShaderSource vertexShader, 1, ampvertexShaderSource, NULL  glCompileShader vertexShader  GLint   status glGetShaderiv vertexShader, GLCOMPILESTATUS, ampstatus  if status  GLTRUE      GLint fragmentShader  glCreateShader GLFRAGMENTSHADER      glShaderSource fragmentShader, 1, ampfragShaderSource, NULL      glCompileShader fragmentShader      glGetShaderiv vertexShader, GLCOMPILESTATUS, ampstatus      if status  GLTRUE              GLint program  glCreateProgram         if program  0                      glAttachShader program, vertexShader              glAttachShader program, fragmentShader              glLinkProgram program              glDetachShader program, fragmentShader              glDetachShader program, vertexShader              glDeleteShader fragmentShader               check for link success...                else      char logBuf[1024]     glGetShaderInfoLog vertexShader, sizeoflogBuf, NULL, GLcharlogBuf      LogToFile charlogBuf   codepre  pThen I render multiple frames, and at some point clean upp  precodeglDeleteProgram program  glDeleteShader vertexShader  codepre  pand destroy the OpenGL context.  Later, I create a new OpenGL context in the same window, initialize it in the same way, but the vertex shader fails to compile.p  pIf I dont render any geometry, I cant get the bug to reproduce, but rendering a single point suffices.p  pIt still happens with a simplified vertex shaderp  precodeversion 120 void main      glPosition  ftransform     glFrontColor  glColor     glBackColor  glColor  codepre  pand a simplified fragment shaderp  precodeversion 120 void main      glFragColor  glColor  codepre  pI tried AMDs CodeXL OpenGL debugger, setting it to break on errors.  It just tells me that the compile is failing, which I already knew.p  pThe OpenGL context that fails is on a window where a different context was previously created, successfully rendered, and destroyed.  Theres nothing wrong with reusing a window like that, is there  I am aware that once youve called codeSetPixelFormatcode, you cant change the pixel format of the window.  I made sure that Im using the same pixel format each time.p  pADDED  While trimming down the rendering code, I found that if I commented out the linep  precodeglEnable GLVERTEXPROGRAMTWOSIDE  codepre  pthen the error went away.  But with more realworld rendering e.g., textures reinstated, it doesnt seem to make a difference.p  pADDED 372014  I finally made a selfcontained Visual C project that can reproduce the bug under certain circumstances, so that any interested parties can try it  a hrefhttpwww.frameforge3d.comnewsmacShaderBugTest.zipShaderBugTest projecta  To make the error reproducible, you need to have Microsofts Application Verifier set to watch for Heap errors.  An enclosed Read Me has more detailed steps to reproduce.p

Negative 50027 pEDIT The things Ive tried below came directly from the alleged duplicate.  The solutions actually do work fine with a user defined sp and probably most system sps, but for whatever reason it doesnt work with this one.p  pI can run codeexec spshowpendingchangescode on the sdistributions publication database without any issues.  However I want to capture the results in a tablep  pIve triedp  precodeSELECT  INTO tmpTable FROM OPENROWSETSQLNCLI, ServerSERVER TrustedConnectionyes,                  EXEC spshowpendingchanges codepre  pandp  precodeSELECT  INTO tmpTable FROM OPENQUERYSERVER, exec spshowpendingchanges codepre  pBoth of these statements return an error that says Invalid object name sysmergepublications.p  pI tried to specify the initial catalog in the connection string and even tried adding a USE statement in the last parameter of each statement i.e. I used an embedded EXEC statement with doublesingle quotes and all that.  But I still end up with the same error.p  pSo how can I get the results from codeexec spshowpendingchangescode into a temporary table, and preferably without having to define the table myself  If all else fails I will make a program in C, but really hoping theres a simpler way to just do this with just SQL.p

I think that malloc sets aside space for ten consecutive characters and gives me a pointer to the first element of that array, and I store that pointer in codecharacterscode. I then print the size of codecharacterscode, and I expect 10, but I get 8. Thats the first weird thing. Then, I ask realloc to find a new spot in the heap, which has space for 100 consecutive characters and return to me a pointer to the first spot. I put that pointer into temp. When I print codetempcodes size, I get 8 again, even though I expect 100. When I print the pointers to codecharacterscode and codetempcode, I get two different locations in the heap. Usually, I would then reassign the codecharacterscode pointer to point to whatever codetempcode is pointing to. Then I tried to free my pointers, and it told me that it couldnt free code0x107b00900code, the exact location codecharacterscode is, because the object at that point wasnt codemalloccodeed however, I did codemalloccode space for codecharacterscode. Why is this happening Am I misunderstanding the functionality of codemalloccode, coderealloccode, codesizeofcode, or something else Thank you for your help.p

Negative 50027 pIve been working on my platform game and I decided to create an air attack for the character.

However, after rearranging the order of these cases, I still had the same result. This is a serious problem for any Flash game developer working with key presses and releases. If anyone knows why this is happening or has any advise on getting around this issue, please help me out Thanks in advance.p  pUPDATE I also just discovered the opposite is also true. emDOWNem  emRIGHTem  emSPACEem doesnt work while emDOWNem  emLEFTem  emSPACEem works fine.p

Negative 50027 pI have a view cshtml that has a tab strip on it. The contents of each tab is of course different. The individual tabs have the correct datainformation on them. There is some javascript that is intended to fire when a selection is made from the control on the individual tab. As it stands right now the first tab rendered the javascript fires. All other tabs do not fire. Further on the tab that does fire first one it obtains the correct value but then when trying to find the matching item in the model it doesnt find a match.

Negative 50027 pIm trying to do port forwarding to my project as a replacement to the current udp hole punching. The reason is because I want clients to start communication with each other without the server intervention. In .net we can use natupnplib, but it doesnt seem to work properly it doesnt work on wifi at my home, for example. Mono.Nat doesnt seem to be the solution as well.p  pI know that there is a way to do that, because uTorrent does port mapping on every pc I checked. I know it might not be compatible everywhere, but I want it to work in devices that uTorrent works inp  pIve looked over the internet for opensource bittorents implementation for port forwarding, but havent found. A solution written in .net environment would be great. So, how do I do it p

Negative 50027 p[Problem]  I am having a problem with web fonts rendering on a specific computer, other computers in my house render the text fine same OS and browser versions. They look really bad and pixelated I know all about differences between how browsers render things differently but its not supposed to look this bad. p  p[What Ive Tried]  I tried prioritizing the .svg in my CSS first on my site to fix it on Google Chrome but it did not help. I installed Firefox and discovered it too does not render the Open Sans font correctly either. I also have tried clearing my cache I have a cache clearing plugin and opening in a incognito window thinking a chrome extension was causing a problem but no difference. From the screen shot it appears Chrome at least renders the larger Open Sans Condensed but the smaller text is pixelated. Its weird a fresh install of FF also has the same problem as Chrome. Also tried downloading the font files from Google Fonts and installing them locally, no difference.p  pIE 11 renders the text correctly.

Negative 50027 pSo I have a codeTaskcode class and a codeDevcode class. I am assigning tasks to devs, and am logging which tasks are assigned to each dev in an codeArrayListcode contained within Dev. This is my method in codeTaskcode that assigns the particular task to the particular devp  precodepublic void setAssignedDevDev dev         this.assignedDevdev                dev.addToTasksAssignedthis  I get a null pointer exception on this line          codepre  pwhich consequently triggers the codeArrayListltTaskgtcode in codeDevcode to log the taskp  precodepublic void addToTasksAssignedTask task                   this.tasksAssigned.addtask    another null pointer exception here     sort list by allotted start time     Collections.sorttasksAssigned, new ComparatorltTaskgt                     Override         public int compareTask t1, Task t2           ift2.getAllottedStartTimegtt1.getAllottedStartTimereturn 1           ift2.getAllottedStartTimeltt1.getAllottedStartTimereturn 1           else return 0           codepre  pYoull notice theres also a section of code in there to sort the array by allotted start time.p  pNow when I initialise some instances of each class and hit run, I get Null Point Exceptions when trying to add the object to the ArrayList.

Why wont the object just add cleanly to the empty ArrayListp  pstrongEDITstrong Thanks Tonga, adding the instance of the ArrayList to the codeDevcode constructor got rid of the null pointers. I actually do need the last argument  there is a list of Devs and then at some point one of them gets assigned. So the codeTaskcode class needs to hold a list of Devs to match up with.p  pNow when I run this the system prints out [[Tasknull], [Tasknull]] Tasks are being added but when they are returned they are null I am expecting to see [task1,task2], am I misunderstanding something Thanksp

Negative 50027 pThis post is regarding a persistence issue with JPA. The JPA provider used is Oracle Toplink provided by weblogic 12c and is built using EclipseLink.p  pThe user makes n number of interactionstransactions and the app writes each transaction to the DB. Under heavy load, while writing the transactions, the app is facing duplicate key exceptions.p  pThe 1st transactions is written successfully to the DB but the subsequent transaction is sometimes rejected with the  duplicate key exception.p  pAs i said the app uses JPA 2.0 in which the shared cache is enabled by default and i think this is something to do with shared cache.p  pI say this because the same app works fine in Weblogic 10 which uses JPA 1.0 and there is no concept of shared cache in there.p  pNow back to the issue, Each entity that takes part in the insert transaction is uniquely identified by an embedded primary key class with overridden hashcodeequals Please see below for the class definition.p  precodeEmbeddedId private CallerEntityPK pk  Column attributes        Embeddable public class CallerEntityPK implements Serializable       ColumnnameSESSIONID     private String sessionId   FIRSTUSERSESSION,SECONDUSERSESSION      ColumnnameTRANSACTIONNBR     private String transNo     01 , 02 etc...

Negative 50027 pforgive me if this question is trivial for some of you but I am a complete newbie to R...p  pI want to use the function evReturn from the R Package erer. It is a function to calculate cumulative abnormal returns and looks like this for one firm and one market index p  precodehh lt evReturny  dataset, firm  Firm1,  y.date  date, index  Index1, est.win  250,  digits  3, event.date  19990505, event.win  5 codepre  pThis works just fine if I have a matrix with 3 columns Date, Stock returns of firm 1 and index return of index 1.p  pNow the case is a bit more complicated. I have appr. 3000 firms and 3000 different indices. So in column 1, I have the dates. In columns 23001, I have the stock returns for all firms. In columns 30026001 I have the returns of the indices. p  pI thought I could run the evReturn function for all firms and all indices with a for loop like thisp  precode gt fori in 23001     hh lt evReturnynumt,firmi,event.date20140102,y.dateDate,    indexi3000,event.win2,est.win230,digits3 codepre  pBut it only returns p  precodeError in [.data.framey, loca  event.win  est.win loca  event.win    undefined columns selected codepre  pI am aware of several posts that resolve the error of undefined columns selected but none helps here. Has anyone an idea how I could create a for loop to let the evReturn run through all my columnsp  pAny help is appreciatedp  pCheers, Paulp

Negative 50027 pI am interested in writing some code which processes an image using OpenGL ES 2.0 and then reads out the image back to memory again to eventually be saved. I have some other code which does some more complex processing and just renders the image to display which works. I now want some code which runs the same processing but just saves the image. It doesnt need to be rendered to the screen. p  pI have created a frame buffer object which outputs to a texture. I then want to use glReadPixels to get the contents of the frame buffer back into memory. The following code snippet should just take a UIImage, resize it to fit onto a 512x512 canvas and then write it out as a 512x512 UIImage. I cant seem to get anything meaningful to display though. If I use an image smaller than 512x512 it does seem to render, but its as if it is drawing straight from the texture storage because I pad images to always be a power of 2 size. The image displays but if I change any of the drawing code, it doesnt affect it.p  pId really appreciate if you could give me some insightp  pThanksp  pHere is my Vertex Shaderp  precodeattribute vec4

Negative 50027 pThis may sound stupid, but C and C11 has surprised me before in terms of the magic it can achieve. Perhaps this is too far, but I prefer confirming my fears rather than assuming them.p  pIs it possible in any way to cast a stdfuture or stdfutureshared objectp  pI find it usually helps if I describe the concrete problem I am having. I am essentially loading some audio and video asynchronously and although Ive started using stdasync which I find really useful, I havent used strongfuturesstrong before until now. Its essentially born out of me learning that strongfuturesstrong seem to handle exceptions fairly well and I want to make my async loading a bit more robust. My crummy program will occasionally run out of memory but that wont occur to the program until the async call has been launched. Solving the memory issue is another issue entirely and not a viable solution currently.p  pAnyway  I have two separate objects that handle the loading of audio AudioLibrary and video VideoLibrary, but since they share a number of commonalities they both inherit from the same base object BaseLibrary.p  pThe audio and video each of these respective libraries return come in their own containers for audio AudioTrack and video VideoTrack, which also inherit from a common object BaseTrack.p  pIm sure you can see where this is going. Id like some general exception handling to occur in the BaseLibrary which will have some virtual functions like loadMedia. These will be overwritten by the derived libraries. Thus the trouble begins. I read that pointer objects like uniqueptr or sharedptr cannot be covariant and so just creating a virtual method doesnt quite solve it.p  pHowever, I was hoping via virtual functions I could still somehow achieve what I wanted.p  pSomething along the lines of BaseLibrary implementing the followingp  precodestdsharedfutureltBaseTrackgt BaseLibraryloadMedia stdsharedfutureltBaseTrackgt BaseLibraryloadMediaHelper codepre  pand then AudioLibrary would implementp  precodestdsharedfutureltAudioTrackgt AudioLibraryloadAudio codepre  pwhere this function makes use of the functions in the BaseLibrary yet returns its own specific type of AudioTrack, rather than a BaseTrack.p  pIs this at all possiblep  pstrongUpdate 1strongp  pThanks to the comment and answer, I see how its possible to achieve what I want, but I have a few more unresolved questions. I think itll be much easier to address those by just being very explicit. Im actually working with sharedptrs since a number of objects are making use of the loaded audio and video, so I have the following type defsp  precodetypedef stdsharedptrltBaseTrackgt BaseTrackPtr typedef stdsharedptrltAudioTrackgt AudioTrackPtr codepre  pAudioTrack inherits from BaseTrack of course. Following the given advice I have a compileable abbreviated code structure which is as follows for the BaseLibraryp  precodeclass BaseLibrary    virtual stdsharedfutureltBaseTrackPtrgt loadMedia   virtual stdsharedfutureltBaseTrackPtrgt loadMediaHelper  0   stdsharedfutureltBaseTrackPtrgt BaseLibraryloadMedia   Place code to catch exceptions coming through the stdfuture here.  Call the loadMediaHelper via async  loadMediaHelper is overwritten in the inherited libraries.  codepre  pAnd the AudioLibraryp  precodeclass AudioLibrary  public BaseLibrary  public   virtual stdsharedfutureltAudioTrackPtrgt loadAudio protected   virtual stdsharedfutureltBaseTrackPtrgt loadMediaHelper   stdsharedfutureltAudioTrackPtrgt AudioLibraryloadAudio    stdsharedfutureltBaseTrackPtrgt futureBaseTrackPtr  loadMedia   return stdasync stdlaunchdeferred, []      return AudioTrackPtr stdstaticpointercastltAudioTrackgt futureBaseTrackPtr.get       stdsharedfutureltBaseTrackPtrgt AudioLibraryloadMediaHelper     Place specific audio loading code here  codepre  pThis structure allows me to catch any videoaudio loading exceptions in one place, and also return the proper AudioVideo Object rather than a base object that needs to be recast.p  pMy two current questions are as followsp  ul liIsnt it best to let the async call in loadMedia in the BaseLibrary be stdlaunchdeferred, and then let the async calls in either loadAudio or loadVideo be stdlaunchasync I essentially want the loading commence immediately, but might as well wait til the outer async call is performed... Does that make senseli liFinally, is this hideously ugly A part of me feels like Im properly leveraging all the goodness C11 has to offer, sharedptrs, futures and so forth. But Im also quite new to futures so... I dont know if putting a shared pointer in a shared future is... Weirdli ul

Negative 50027 pWere are designing a Rails 4.1 application that will be deployed into small boxes, quite possibly ARM based e.g. a hrefhttpcuboxi.comproducts relnofollowCuBoxi2eXa or some cheaper a hrefhttpwww.intel.comcontentwwwusennucoverview.html relnofollowIntel NUCa if ARM doesnt cut it.p  pThere will be some other services running on the same box that will get most of the traffic and the Rails app is mostly there for administrative purposes with only minimal traffic most of the time, but should handle extensive workflows of a few people at times entering data.

Negative 50027 pIm working on a map for a Roguelike, and each cell of the map is accessed through a dictionarysup[1]sup, with the key being a custom struct codeAxis3code, which just stores an integer location on 3 axes. The issue is, the cell itself also needs to keep track of its position, and this leads to a duplication of data. In this particular example, it isnt a lot of additional memory code3 MBcode for the active area, code60 MBcode for the map area kept in memory but not currently being calculated, but it exposes an issue that I feel should be solved if possible especially since cells arent the only objects that key themselves in collections based on their position.p  pIm working in a hrefquestionstaggedunity classposttag titleshow questions tagged 39unity39 reltagunitya, and thus have so far looked at options directly available in .NET 3.5 and outside implementations compatible with such, but havent had any luck in finding a collection where the key is part of or is the value. codeHashSetcode would actually work perfectly for what I want simply make codeAxis3code and codeCellcode with the same position equate to equal, but there is no way to retrieve the original reference without iterating the set.p  pIve also looked into codeKeyedCollectioncode, but it doesnt appear to reference the key inside of the value, instead copying the key from the value and inserting it into a separate collection for lookup purposes, which would make codeKeyedCollectioncode actually worse for memory footprint.p  p[1] For the curious, this is done instead of an array, because not every zlevel or even every layer terrain, items, enemies, etc. in each zlevel is filled, so using a dictionary allows for a much smaller memory footprint while still having fast access, as long as missing cells are treated as a default value much the same way as a sparse array. It also has other benefits that arent worth getting into here.p

Negative 50027 pI use cURL to transfer data between two servers  both running Ubuntu 12.04, Lighttpd and PHP5.5 FastCGI.  I used to bzcompress the data  this is purely a legacy issue I had found that bzcompress gives more efficient compression when writing out text data to files.  The data transferred tended to be quite small  typically of the order of under 512 bytes.  p  pHowever, today I ran into an issue when the data were somewhat longer  closer to 1 kB.  curlexec duly returned true and no errors were reported.  However, the data never arrived at their destination.  My original code was as followsp  precodecurlsetoptch,CURLOPTURL,url curlsetoptch,CURLOPTPOST,1 curlsetoptch,CURLOPTPOSTFIELDS,cql curlsetoptch,CURLOPTRETURNTRANSFER,false codepre  pI suspected that there was an issue with encoding and, perhaps with my bzcompression. So I replaced bzcompress with gzdeflate and altered my curl code to p  precodecurlsetoptch,CURLOPTHTTPHEADER,arrayContentTypetextplain curlsetoptch,CURLOPTENCODING, curlsetoptch,CURLOPTURL,url curlsetoptch,CURLOPTPOST,1 curlsetoptch,CURLOPTPOSTFIELDS,cql codepre  pThis works  no more vanishing data.  However, the solution is purely the result of cobbling together an alternative based on some reading of the PHP documentation and some of the posts here  not a thing to be relied on for what is a small but mission critical part of what I am doing.p  pSo the question  what is going on here  Why did the original code fail with longer data strings and why does the latter version work  Will it always work or is there something else that is missingp  pI would much appreciate any help and tips.p

Negative 50027 pthis might seem like a remarkably simple question, but I want to be sure before I proceed and I was struggling to find any information regarding this.p  pI am currently in the process of transferring an existing VMWare environment to Windows Azure. I have been given three different VMDK files, one for each hard drive of a server, and am aware that I need to convert these to VHD for image upload in Azure.p  pMy question is whether I need to make these VMDK files into one VHD image or if I can upload multiple VHD images and work with them in the portal. I have seen that it is possible to convert multiple VMDK files into a solitary VMDK file, but I am unsure if this would be appropriate.p  pThis is my first exposure to this work, so apologies if this seems like pure basicsp

Negative 50027 pI have been developing a webserver application using Flask. So far, I created a small framework, where the users can draw some boxes in a image, using canvas and javascript. I keep the boxes information in a vector in javascript as well as the image information. However, all this data must be submitted and stored in a database the server side. Therefore, I have a button to submit all this content, but I have no idea how to retrieve the javascript data I have, i.e. boxes and image information.p  pIs it possible to get the javascript information to submit like that I have come up with some ideas such as printing the information in hidden HTML elements, or, maybe, using AJAX for sending the information to the server, but I dont think those are the correct methods for dealing with this problem in Flask.

Negative 50027 pI think I may know the answer to this butp  pI am building an app that requires the user to take a photo.  The client would like the photo to be taken from within the applications interface, so their branding stays in place and they get to use a custom shutter icon etc.p  pI am evaluating PhoneGap and Xamarin, but so far I can only find how to launch the devices default camera app and get the photo back from there.p  pLooking around a lot off applications do it using the deault camera app, so I am guesing what I am looking for might be beyond these frameworks like Xamarin and Phone Gap.p  pSo is there a way to do what the client wants if we are not building nativelyp  pThanks for your help.p

Six total navigation states as each tab starts with a Search Form page which leads to a Search Results page on submit and then a View page emonmousedownem click action of an individual result for each of Person amp Address data. The Search Form pages are sessionscoped, and designed to pass search parameters around to each other in a header box entitled Users Search Query. It does this because the Search Results page for Address searches is really an overloaded Person search result with Address thrown in for Search for People by Address. Yes this could all probably be accomplished from a single page with some optional search params, but its not, and for whatever reason Im not permitted to change the core page structure, just tasked to bug fix.p  pTheres a longstanding bug Ive been asked to fix, where one page Person always shows search parameters from the other Address when both are set, because of some incomplete logic inside the panelGrid where the search query parameters are displayedp  precodelthoutputText valueCoverage Typegt lthoutputText valueaddressSearchUI.searchParameters.coverageType     renderedempty personSearchUI.searchParameters.coverageTypegt lthoutputText valuepersonSearchUI.searchParameters.coverageType    renderedempty personSearchUI.searchParameters.coverageTypegt codepre  pA little too overly simplistic if a Person searchs Coverage Type was set, use that, but if not, try to use the Address coverageType search parameter.

What if neither of them are set yet It should show a default value of ALL COVERAGE, easy enough to add but doesnt address that main problem.p  pSOLUTION Thought this would be an easy fix but Ive hit a major wall trying to do either one of the following two simple things that I think would solve my problemp  pA get the sessionscoped value of one pages search parameter and reset it or set to empty string then that naiive presentation logic could be left as isp  pB call the reset button of one page programmatically from Java when backing bean init method gets called as we switch tabs I can call the method but am not sure how to get the original session instance rather than creating a new one, which will fire to a nonexistent page UIwisep  hr  pHeres what Ive tried so farp  pA Adding an strongactionListenerstrong attribute to the submit button itself and trying to forcibly reset values from the other Search Form. p  precodelthcommandButton        idpersonReset        styleClasssubmitButton        valueReset             actiontransactionSearchUI.resetSearchgt  lthcommandButton        idpersonSearch            styleClasssearchButton       valueSearch       renderedpersonSearchUI.canDo[performSearch]        actionListeneraddressSearchUI.resetSearch       actionpersonSearchUI.performSearchgt codepre  pB In the backing bean of each search, try to invoke the reset button of the otherp  precode utility method    private UIComponent findComponentString id, UIComponent where         if where  null            return null                else if where.getId.equalsid            return where                else            ListltUIComponentgt childrenList  where.getChildren           if childrenList  null  childrenList.isEmpty               return null                      for UIComponent child  childrenList               UIComponent result  null              result  findComponentid, child              ifresult  null                  return result                                  return null            ... then inside init method that is called when Person tab loads  FacesContext facesContext  FacesContext.getCurrentInstance UIViewRoot root  facesContext.getViewRoot       HtmlCommandButton button  HtmlCommandButton findComponentaddressReset, root ActionEvent actionEvent  new ActionEventbutton actionEvent.queue codepre  pFails with NullPointerException, so clearly cant access one tab from the others backing bean in this way unless Im missing something.p  pC JavaScript approach to reset values from one tab to the otherp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt function clearAddressSearchParams      document.getElementByIdAddressSearchaddressSearchaddressReset.click     document.forms[AddressSearchaddressSearch].reset     return false  window.onload  clearStats ltscriptgt codepre  pNeither of those clientside methods of trying to fire the Reset button action are going to work, since again, the Person and Address Search Forms were setup as two totally separate beans and pages even though one ultimately extends the other, one wont be active or available in the DOM so it wont find the elements.p  pAt this point, I know there is clearly a simpler solution, but Im at my wits end and probably coming at this from the wrong angle, so I dont know what else to do but put up a bounty for some of the JSF geniuses here. But if anyone can suggest a fix given my limitations of older JSF technology, no adding external libs and maintaining same basic code structure, youll get the bounty and tons of appreciation.p  pEDIT To summarize all this into a single question, can anyone suggest a reliable legacyJSF 1.1 compatible way to flush a session variable or reset it, independently of its page where it gets set being activep

Negative 50027 pI have recently and successfully created a two line list view in Android Studio. However what I would like to do now is to implement alphabetical scrolling and section headers for letters of the alphabet that contain items beginning with that letter e.g. items beginning with A to be under a section header named A. I also want section headers for letters containing empty content not to appear i.e. for the letter W if there are no items in my list begging with W then I dont want the W section header to appear etc.  p  pThe image below is what my activity currently looks like, and the image below that is what I am trying to achieve two lines per item not one. The 4 sections of code below represent what I have used to create my list view as seen in the first image.p  pPlease bear in mind all that needs to be done is to add an alphabet scroller and section headers hence I would be very grateful if when giving an answer to provide the most efficient way of achieving the above as well as indicating if something needs to be added, taken away or even

Negative 50027 pWe have similar functionality for Twitter  linking to twitterpostmessageHello will open the Twitter app if installed. Is there a similar way to invoke infacebookapp share dialog via fb p  pThe reason wed like to use fb over a hrefhttpfacebook.comsharer.phpu relnofollowhttpfacebook.comsharer.phpua is UX. From their phones, most FB and Twitter users use the native apps not the mobile web versions so their apps are logged in and their browsers are not. The twitterpost link works beautifully for Twitter, but we cant figure out if something similar is possible with Facebook we tried most of whats on a hrefhttpwiki.akosma.comIPhoneURLSchemesFacebook relnofollowhttpwiki.akosma.comIPhoneURLSchemesFacebooka but no dice. Even the actual share button invokes the fb web version, not the app. Suggestionsp  pThanks.p

Negative 50027 pin an effort to further my understanding of OOP, Ive decided to refactor some of my code using an abstract class. The idea is roughlyp  ul liOne parent abstract class which forms a base for all child classs to extend.li liOne helper class which has a series of methods which children of the abstract class will need.li lithe helper class will be used by other classes, so I dont want this to be an integral part of the abstract class. li ul  pThe problemp  pThe child class extends the abstract class as intended, but PHP gives me a warning that the codehelpercode argument is missing from the abstract classs constructor. I believe the constructor is being called because there isnt one in my child class, which is fine, but since you dont directly call an abstract class, how do I get this to work Sample code belowp  precodeabstract class ParentAbstract      public inputhelpermethods      public function construct helpers  NULL                set the helper methods         thisgtinputhelpermethods  helpers        codepre  pThe variable codehelperscode is in another file at the moment, which is included at the top of the file with the abstract class.

That leads me to believe that this might be an iOS bug.p  pBut in case it is not, is anyone else had the call to URLForUbiquityContainerIdentifier never return If so, what did you do to fix itp  pThis is a Core Data app using iCLoud storage for an sqlite data store.p  pI call ubiquityIdentityToken before and it retuns a nonnil value, so iCloud is available.p  precodeNSURL cloudStoreURL  [fileManager URLForUbiquityContainerIdentifierXXYYZZ.com.yourcompany.appname] codepre

Negative 50027 pI have been using METIS to partition a graph. As of now, I am not using any special options, so I presume METIS is partitioning the graph while minimizing the edge cut.p  pThing is, the graphs I am working on has few vertices that have a lot of neighbors. I guess that means I will have to pass the option to reduce the communication volume as opposed to edge cut.p  pHow do I do this I do not understand what is the point of the vsize parameter in section 5.8 page 26. Do I need to mess with ncon or vwgt, or objval Do I just do options[METISOPTIONOBJTYPE]  METISOBJTYPEVOL and pass it to the functionp  pAlso, for a graph that may not have the number of vertices as power of 2, which variant of the function should I use kwaymost probably or bisectionp  pI would have asked these questions on the METIS forums but unfortunately it has been a while since I registered for it without any reply from their website so I am asking here.p

Negative 50027 pSo I have reached my ceiling of knowledge when it comes to Qt and C in general I guess. I am creating check boxes in a QScrollArea based off the input from a QComboBox. Depending on the value selected in the QComboBox, a specific number of check boxes are created. Once I created those check boxes, I am having a problem understanding how to interact in my case, simply check to see if they are checked or not with them outside of the function they are being created and called in. I know how to work with them if the buttons were static, but since the check boxes are dynamic is that the right word and can change, I dont know what to do. Below is a little snippet of code on how the check boxes are created. If I now want to simply check if any of the boxes are checked, how do I do that. Can I return or call the created check boxes in another function somehow I know Ill simply need to loop through the array and check, I just simply dont know how to get the array of check boxes into another function or how to return them in the function below. p  pThanks for the helpp  precodevoid MyProgramcreatecheckboxesQString opnum  QWidget MDAcheckboxes  new QWidgetuigtMDA QVBoxLayout MDAlayout  new QVBoxLayoutMDAcheckboxes QCheckBox MDAmycheckBox[9] QListltQStringgt boxes  if opnum  640      boxes ltlt 161 ltlt 162      for int i  0 i lt 2 i          MDAmycheckBox[i]  new QCheckBoxMDAcheckboxes     MDAmycheckBox[i]gtsetTextboxes[i]     MDAlayoutgtaddWidgetMDAmycheckBox[i]          uigtMDAgtsetWidgetMDAcheckboxes  else if opnum  645      boxes ltlt 1301ltlt132ltlt133ltlt134ltlt135      for int i  0 i lt 5 i          MDAmycheckBox[i]  new QCheckBoxMDAcheckboxes     MDAmycheckBox[i]gtsetTextboxes[i]     MDAlayoutgtaddWidgetMDAmycheckBox[i]          uigtMDAgtsetWidgetMDAcheckboxes  else if opnum  650       boxes ltlt 136ltlt137ltlt138ltlt139ltlt1310ltlt1311ltlt1312ltlt1313ltlt1314     for int i  0 i lt 9 i          MDAmycheckBox[i]  new QCheckBoxMDAcheckboxes     MDAmycheckBox[i]gtsetTextboxes[i]     MDAlayoutgtaddWidgetMDAmycheckBox[i]          uigtMDAgtsetWidgetMDAcheckboxes   codepre

Negative 50027 pI have an array of emkem integer intervals in [1,emnem], where emkemnbsplenbsp10sup5sup and emnemnbsplenbsp10sup5sup. For example, if emkem is 3 and emnem is 5, the list might be [1,4],nbsp[3,5],nbsp[2,3].p  pFor arbitrary subarrays of this array of intervals, I want to be able to count how many intervals contain a given value. For example, in the above example array, I might take the subarray from index 1 to index 2 namely [1,4],nbsp[3,5] and count the number of intervals in that subarray contain the value 2 just 1 [1,4]. This query would be expressed as the 3tuple emminindexem,emmaxindexem,emvalueem, in this case 1,2,2.p  pMy idea is to build a segment tree from interval array where each node contains sorted intervals sorted by their start index lying on that node. Ex Root will contain all the intervals sorted in ascending order of start index, its left child will contain sorted intervals of first half of interval array and right child will contain sorted intervals of second half and so on.p  pSo in order to solve a query emminindexem,emmaxindexem,emvalueem, I can just traverse the tree and whenever I am in a node which is completely inside [emminindexem,emmaxindexem] I can do a binary search over intervals and count the occurrences. In the worst case each query will take codeOlog2ncode operations.p  pCan we do better than it Is there any way to process the data first and then answer each query in constant timep

Negative 50027 pI am trying to create a UITextView with a hyperlink so that when the user clicks on the link, they are taken to safari to open the webpage. I have read on link detectors for a textview but those samples always show link detection working if an actual url is present in the text ie. www.google.com. I want it to be regular text that, when clicked, opens an associated URL. ie. Google is the text and when clicked, opens up a url www.google.com. How can I accomplish this in iOS78p
Negative 50027 pIm trying to do an adaptation of the merge sort using a fork join. Im using this as a forkjoin example so I need to keep it basic. I want to edit the regular merge sort so that when the segment size goes below 101 100 or less it will use an insertion sort to sort that segment and then come out of the recursive call and start merging the segments back together. The sort is just simply not working. If I change the order of the invoke and jointo stop other code from running it works fine so Im assuming it is because my sorts are running concurrently that it is not correct. For example if I write             int mid  lbub2             MergeInsertSortQ left  new MergeInsertSortQf,lb,mid             MergeInsertSortQ right  new MergeInsertSortQf,mid,ub             left.fork left.join             right.fork right.join             mergef,lb,mid,ub It sorts fine, but this is esentially sequential so is not really what Im trying to do.p  pHere is the code I am using including a little test in mainp  pimport java.util.concurrent.p  ppublic class MergeInsertSortQ extends RecursiveActionp  precodeprivate int[] f private int lb, ub public MergeInsertSortQint f[], int lb, int ub      this.f  f     this.lblb     this.ubub   protected void compute     Insertion Sort performed when a segment of size     100 or less is reached otherwise do merge sort     ifublbgt100              int mid  lbub2         MergeInsertSortQ left  new MergeInsertSortQf,lb,mid         MergeInsertSortQ right  new MergeInsertSortQf,mid,ub         invokeAllleft,right         left.join         right.join         mergef,lb,mid,ub          else ifublbgt1              for int i  lb iltubi                      int temp  f[i]             int j  i1             while j gt 0 ampamp f[j] gt temp                              f[j1]  f[j]                 j  j1                          f[j1]  temp                 protected void mergeint f[], int lower, int middle, int top     int i  lower int j  middle      use temp array to store merged subsequence     int temp[]  new int[toplower] int t  0      whilei lt middle ampamp j lt top              iff[i] lt f[j]                      temp[t]f[i]it                  else             temp[t]  f[j] j t                    tag on remaining sequence     whilei lt middle              temp[t]f[i] i t          whilej lt top              temp[t]  f[j] j t           copy temp back to f     i  lower t  0     whilet lt temp.length              f[i]  temp[t] i t        public static void mainString[] args      Initialise amp print array before sorting     int A[]new int[200]     forint j0jltA.lengthj              A[j]intMath.random10000         System.out.printA[j]           System.out.println     System.out.println     System.out.println       Do the sort     ForkJoinPool fjPoolnew ForkJoinPool     fjPool.invokenew MergeInsertSortQA,0,A.length      Check if array sorted and print     boolean sortedtrue     forint i0iltA.length1i              System.out.printA[i]            if A[i]gtA[i1]                      System.out.println             System.out.printlnA[i] is greater than A[i1], location i             sortedfalse             break                   System.out.println     if sorted System.out.printlnThe array is sorted     else System.out.printlnWARNING The array is NOT SORTED  codepre  pp

Negative 50027 pFrom what I know, references are just another name for a variable whilst pointers are their own variable. Pointers take up space. People often say use a reference or pointer but they dont say which is better. If references take up no memory of their own, then references win in that department. What I dont know is if the compiler makes a distinction between references and normal variable. If you do operations on a reference, does it compile to the same code as normal variable p

Negative 50027 pFor a school project, I need to send and receive some data named as TLV through the network.p  pIn fact, because a TLV can be small, the application send a metaTLV that groups several TLV in a packet.p  pMy problem is the following  what are the classes that I need to create to modelise properly the TLV p  pI dont know if I need to mention all the TLV possible but what I know is the following p  pEvery TLV has a field type that identify the semantic of the TLV Every TLV but one has a field length. However for five TLV, this sized is fixed Two TLV has exactly the same field  type, length0 Three TLV has exactly the same field  type, length8 and id. Just the type change and their namep  pThe other are quite different. p  pMy first idea was to use a mother class TLV that has a enum to store all the different TLV allowed like this p  penum class to avoid conflicts p  precodeenum class TlvType          Pad1,         PadN,         Bad,         No,         PeersReq,         Peers,         Data,         IHave,         IDontHave,         INeed,       Unknown,      class Tlv  private     virtual void tostreamstdostreamamp output const  0 protected     uint8t length public      virtual TlvType type const  0      Solution find here  httpstackoverflow.comquestions2059058cabstractclassoperatoroverloadingandinterfaceenforcementquestion     friend stdostream ampoperatorltltstdostreamamp output, const Tlvamp tlv          tlv.tostreamoutput         return output           TO DO  do we really need that this method is virtual      virtual uint8t length const      Tlv      virtual Tlv     class PadN  public Tlv  private     void tostreamstdostreamamp output const     static constexpr TlvType code return TlvTypePadN public     TlvType type const     PadN     PadNuint8t zerobytes     void setlengthuint8t length  codepre  pThe problem is that this codes somehow an algebraic type, that introduces a lot of redondant code. For example, I need to define for each tlv the method codeTlvType type constcode . Since some Tlv has a fixed size, I only want a setter for the ones that can change their size.p  pMoreover each Tlv will be then formated in a format ready to send to the network. This, looks like a lot to serialization. However, I think that serialization is overkill for this project. Besides, since its a network project, each student use his own language. And the only thing that we know is the format of a tlv that needs to be sent throught the network.p  pBecause my code is quite redondant I think that my modelisation is wrong for the TLV. And Im doubting about using a class for each TLV. Indeed, probably the user wont change his TLV once he created it. He just wants to send it. And there is the same problem for the other way i need to receive TLV. So im not sure how should I do.p

Negative 50027 pWith the advent of docker and scheduling amp orchestration services like Amazons ECS, Im trying to determine the optimal way to deploy my Node API. With Docker and ECS aside, Ive wanted to take advantage of the Node cluster library to gracefully handle crashing the node app in the event of an asynchronous error as suggested in the a hrefhttpnodejs.orgapicluster.htmldocumentationa, by creating a master process and multiple worker processors. p  pOne of the benefits of the cluster approach, besides gracefully handling errors, is creating a worker processor for each available CPU. But does this make sense in the docker world Would it make sense to have multiple node processes running in a single docker container that was going to be scaled into a cluster of EC2 instances on ECS p  pWithout the Node cluster approach, Id lose the ability to gracefully handle errors and so I think that at a minimum, I should run a master and one worker processes per docker container. Im still confused as to how many CPUs to define in the Task Definition for ECS. The a hrefhttpdocs.aws.amazon.comAmazonECSlatestdeveloperguidetaskdefintions.htmlECS documentationa says something about each container instance having 1024 units per CPU but that isnt the same thing as EC2 compute units, is it And with that said, Id need to pick EC2 instance types with the appropriate amount of vCPUs to achieve this rightp  pI understand that achieving the most optimal configuration may require some level of benchmarking my specific Node API application, but it would be awesome to have a better idea of where to start. Maybe there is some studyingresearch I need to do Any pointers to guide me on the path or recommendations would be most appreciated p  pEdit To recap my specific questionsp  ol lipDoes it make sense to run a masterworker cluster as described a hrefhttpnodejs.orgapicluster.htmlherea inside a docker container to achieve graceful crashingpli lipWould it make sense to use nearly identical code as described in the Cluster docs, to scale to available CPUs via coderequireos.cpus.lengthcode pli lipWhat does Amazon mean in the documentation for ECS Task Definitions, where it says for the codecpuscode setting, that a codecontainer instance has 1024 units per CPUcode And what would be a good starting point for the this settingpli lipWhat would be a good starting point for the instance type to use for an ECS cluster aimed at serving a Node API based on the above And how do the available vCPUs affect the previous questionspli ol
Negative 50027 pI have 2 shader programs  one for rendering sprites with textures and the second one to render polygons. I have enabled blending and Zbuffer like sop  precodeGLES20.glEnableGLES20.GLBLEND GLES20.glBlendFuncGLES20.GLONE, GLES20.GLONEMINUSSRCALPHA  GLES20.glEnable GLES20.GLDEPTHTEST  GLES20.glDepthFunc GLES20.GLLEQUAL  GLES20.glDepthMask true   GLES20.glDepthRangef0,  maxZDepth maxZDepth  100f codepre  pAnd my rendering consists of 2 rendering invocations glDrawElements one for sprites and right after it for polygons with adequate shader programs... The order of sending objects data vertices etc... to shader is sorted from the objects lowest Z value to the highest and I also had to add such instruction to my sprites shaderp  precodeifglFragColor.a  0.0     discard codepre  pNow, the blending and Zbuffer are working properly but only in the scope of one shader at a time. The blending of the objects drawn by first shader doesnt seem to be relevant for the second shader... Heres an examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjGIs6.png altenter image description herep  pThe sprite here has higher Z value than the brown polygon beneath it and thats why its drawn on the polygon but blending fails and you can see the grey background created by glClearColor showing around the sprite...p  pDoes anybody know some good solution to this problem I thought about combining 2 shader programs into one and then there would be only 1 rendering invocation which I hope would solve it but Id prefer to preserve 2 separate shader programs for sprites and polygons...p

Negative 50027 pI am using SignalR version 2.1.2 with ASP.Net MVC 5 amp NServiceBus and have following requirementp  pThere is a signup page anonymous authentication in which SignalR is used to send notifications. Every form submit will generate a new connection id which needs to be kept in a collection so that I can send response to the client. Context.User.Identity.Name is empty hence connections.Addname, Context.ConnectionId cannot be used in OnConnected hub event as given in this a hrefhttpwww.asp.netsignalroverviewguidetotheapimappinguserstoconnections relnofollowpostap  pSimilar problem exists in Login page.p  pIf there is a possibility to control the ConnectionId then I could overcome this situation but it looks like new version of SignalR has got rid of connection factory.p  pI am using Redis cache so one option is to write my own connection management code to keep these connection ids in it.p  pSecond option is to use Forms Authentication in such a way that a Anonymous Role is assigned to these users which restricts the usage to anonymous viewscontrollers but gives a Name to the user so that Context.User.Identity.Name is not empty. With this I can use built in SignalR mechanism to manage connection ids for me.p

In other words, I cant seem to reliably pinpoint when it started happening.p  pTo illustrate this, heres an excerpt of my tests, indented for clarity. Numbers are revisions. For each test, I update to revision and do a full rebuild.p  precode      3977 Exception. This is the mostrecent revision.  3839 OK.

Huh I JUST tried 3852, and last time it didnt happen 3778 OK. Going back this far, Ive never seen it happen.     3852 Exception. I guess Ill start working my way BACK to see when it stops.    3828 Exception   3810 OK    3828 Exception.  Just making sure.   3810 OK. Just making sure again.    3828 OK.

Negative 50027 pScenariop  pI have built search form with 2 states  First state triggers the second one onclick, and sets some state parameters with state.go function.  Second state has resolve function which gets state parameter, and resolves search results.p  pemThis approach seems much cleaner way to do item, oposing to classic approach inject the search service in state one, get results, save them in search service, change state and load results from injected service. p  pQuestionp  pstrongHow to make unit test for this strongp  pInitial idea is that I should make a test which should trigger a locate with searchTerm and switch to results page.  It fails because the states do not resolve properly with jasmine.  Sometimes its locked in first state, in other scenarios state is always .p  pWhen I removed resolve block from configuration it works as expected, and tests pass, so the problem is obviously in resolve block.

In fact, I need to know if the shutdown got scheduled immediately to inform the user. How can I get if the scheduled immediatlyp

Negative 50027 pIn short, the question is how to pass ap  precodeEigenMapltEigenMatrixXdgt codepre  pobject to a function which expects ap  precodeEigenMatrixXd codepre  pobject.p  hr  pLonger storyp  pI have this C function declarationp  precodevoid npMatrixconst EigenMatrixXd ampdata, EigenMatrixXd ampresult codepre  ptogether with this implementationp  precodevoid npMatrixconst EigenMatrixXd ampdata, EigenMatrixXd ampresult  Just do s.th. with arguments stdcout ltlt data ltlt stdendl  result1,1  5 stdcout ltlt result ltlt stdendl  codepre  pI want to call this function from python using numpy.array as arguments. To this end, I use a wrapper function written in cp  precodevoid pyMatrixconst double pdata, const int dimData[],                               double presult, const int dimResult[] codepre  pwhich takes a pointer to data, the size of the data array, a pointer to result, and the size of the result array. The data pointer points to a const patch of memory, since data is not to be altered while the patch of memory reserved for result is writeable. The implementation of the functionp  precodevoid pyMatrixconst double pdata, const int dimData[], double presult, const int dimResult[]  EigenMapltconst EigenMatrixXdgt dataMappdata, dimData[0], dimData[1] EigenMapltEigenMatrixXdgt resultMappresult, dimResult[0], dimResult[1]  resultMap0,0  100  npMatrixdataMap, resultMap  codepre  pdefines a EigenMap for data and result, respectively. A EigenMap allows to access raw memory as a kind of EigenMatrix. The dataMap is of typep  precodeltconst EigenMatrixXdgt codepre  psince the associated memory is read only resultMap in contrast is of typep  precodeltEigenMatrixXdgt codepre  psince it must we writeable. The linep  precoderesultMap0,0  100 codepre  pshows, that resultMap is in deed writeable. While passing dataMap to the npMatrix where a const EigenMatrixXd is expected works, I could not find a way to pass resultMap in the same way. I am sure, the trouble comes from the fact, that the first argument of npMatrix is const, and the second is not. A possible solution I found is to definep  precodeEigenMatrixXd resultMatrix  resultMap codepre  pand pass this resutlMatrix to npMatrix. However, I guess, this creates a copy and hence kills the nice memory mapping of EigenMap. So my question is.p  pIs there a way to pass a EigenMap to a function which expects a nonconst EigenMatrixXd insteadp  pAs a side note I could change npMatrix to expect a EigenMap, but since in the real project, functions are already there and tested, I would rather not temper with them.p  pTo complete the question, here is the python file to call pyMatrixp  precodeimport ctypes as ct import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt   Load libfit and define input types ct.cdll.LoadLibraryhomewmaderMethodsfdmbrefactorbuildpyinterfacelibpyfit.so libfit  ct.CDLLlibpyfit.so  libfit.pyMatrix.argtypes  [np.ctypeslib.ndpointerdtypenp.float64, ndim2,                                                      np.ctypeslib.ndpointerdtypenp.int32, ndim1,                                                      np.ctypeslib.ndpointerdtypenp.float64, ndim2, flagsWRITEABLE,                                                      np.ctypeslib.ndpointerdtypenp.int32, ndim1                                                      ]  data  np.arraynp.random.randn10, 2, dtypenp.float64, orderF result  np.zeroslikedata, dtypenp.float64, orderF  libfit.pyMatrixdata, np.arraydata.shape, dtypenp.int32,                               result, np.arrayresult.shape, dtypenp.int32 codepre

In other words, I need to know only if the mouse cursor is active and blinking in the editable portion of the codeComboBoxcode, and the codeComboBoxcode is ready for input from the users typing on the keyboard.p  pIve tried codeTextBoxBase.GotFocuscode, codeTextBoxBase.GotKeyboardFocuscode, etc.p  pThese events fire even when a user simply clicks on the codeComboBoxcode, which doesnt make any sense why does a codeGotKeyboardFocuscode event fire even when I havent even touched the keyboard.p  pAnyways, how can I detect ONLY when the mouse cursor is active and blinking in the editable portion of the codeComboBoxcode, and the codeComboBoxcode is ready for input from the users typing on the keyboardp

Negative 50027 pI am using the menu image plugin for wordpress see here a hrefhttpswordpress.orgsupportpluginmenuimage relnofollowhttpswordpress.orgsupportpluginmenuimagea.  This lets me associate images with the menus I define in the Themes section.  Ive built a template that then allows me to pull grab the url of the image and apply it to the menu item in my template.  It all works pretty well, except for one thing.p  pUsing the same technique, I implemented a logos section in my footer where the user could define a menu of links and associate logos with them and then these logos would display all the bottom of the page as clickable links.  The only problem is, Ive discovered that the plugin grabs the thumbnail ID of the image, rather than the attachment ID of the image when it associates an image with the menu item, so for rather than getting the full version of the image, Im only getting the thumbnail that appears in the image selector.  This obviously wont work for me but I cant figure out how to get the attachment ID of the image, instead of the thumbnail ID.  I have the source code of the plugin so I can modify it directly.  The line that is giving me problems is belowp  precode if  isset itemgtthumbnailid            itemgtthumbnailid  getpostthumbnailid itemgtID    codepre  pAny idea what I need to replace getpostthumbnailid with in order to get the actual attachment ID of the item instead of the thumbnail Ive been all over the Wordpress site and I cannot find what I need.p

Negative 50027 pI want to set up a sort of ISearch mode replacement in Emacs, where I can run a command after every input to the minibuffer. Is it possiblep  pEDIT 1p  pThe idea is to completely replace ISearch with my own mode. Ideally, Id like it to have most of the functionality that ISearch has like highlighting results as you type. To implement some, Id need to run a command after every key is input. Is there a way to trigger a function when the minibuffer change, or should I use something that isnt the minibufferp  pEDIT 2p  pTo be more specific, basically I am looking to take a string from the minibuffer and highlight all matches in the buffer, much like in ISearch mode. So essentially, after each letter, symbol, or number inputted into the minibuffer, Id like to be able to recognize that change and run some arbitrary elisp. Similar to how helm recognizes input and updates search results.p

Negative 50027 pIm building a P2P wifi app that requires bidirectional communication between every connected device and a central host Ive already addressed the issue of forcing the host onto that device in particular.  p  pIve run through the developer.android tutorials and gotten all I can from those, but my issue at the moment is that I cant seem to get the hosts sockets to connect to the P2P client devices properly...p  pMy application for my host side currently displays all of the phones that have connected to it via the p2p connect command and has the addresses of all of those devices displayed in a list view on screen.  These addresses are shown as IPV6I think addresses and are usually identical to the devices hardcoded MAC addresses, with one hex pair value changed.  Example Devices MAC is AABBCCDDEEFF and hosts address for that device shows as being AABBCCDDEE13 or similar.p  pThe client side at this point in the workflow is waiting for the server to send it a small packet via port 8000.p  pHowever, at this point, when I attempt to connect from the host to any client, it throws the exception Host could not be resolved... and lists the devices IP address Im trying to connect to, which properly matches the expected address that is displayed on screen of the connected devices.p  pI believe my particular concern revolves around the following line of codep  precodesocket.connectnew InetSocketAddressdevice.deviceAddress, 8000, 5000 codepre  pWhere device is the WifiP2pDevice that we are trying to connect to.  In particular, looking at the InetSocketAddress help page, it expects our device address to be in the form of a string of IPV4 or IPV6.  Is androids P2P Device Address really IPV6  Or am I missing something else completely obviousp  pEDIT I have been properly informed that P2P addresses are not applicable in any shape or form to sockets.  The only way P2P sockets can be done this way in Android is 1. Clients get the IP address of the group ownerserver from the Broadcast receivers P2PInfo object. 2. All of the clients connect to the servers ip using sockets. 3. As the server receives connections, the server can get the ip addresses from the client devices via the socket that is created for each client. 4. Once both parties have each others IP addresses, proper bidirectional communication can be achieved.  p
Negative 50027 pI have a task that is difficult for me to handle. The task is Create recursive function that can be generate a string of length N N lt 100, formed by the letters A, B and C and does not containing two identical adjacent substring. For example enter for N  6 and the program should generate such a string in which no one else to repeated substrings ABACAB. Wrong strings are strongAAstrongBACA  because A is to A AstrongBCBCstrongA  as BC is to BC and strongABCABCstrong is also wrong because ABC is to ABC.p  pI made a version of the program but an iterative way, here is the codep  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltctimegt  using namespace std  const char letters[]  ABC  char generaterand        return letters[rand  3]    int checkchar s, int pos        for int i  1 i lt pos  12 i                int flag  1          for int j  0 j lt i j          if s[posj]  s[posij]                        flag  0                  break                    if flag             return 1           return 0   int main        char s[100]     int n      cout ltlt enter n      cin gtgt n      srandtimeNULL      for int i  0 i lt n i                do                       s[i]  generaterand           while checks, i          cout ltlt s[i] ltlt              cout ltlt  ok ltlt endl      systempause     return 0  codepre  pI think the entrance of the recursive function may need to be the number of characters in the string, which will seek to repeat with an adjacent string and each time increased by 1, but not more than half the length of the original string, but do not know how to do it.p

Negative 50027 pI am trying to find a method of vertical centring images in a div of uncertain height, allowing the images to overflow the div when their heigh is larger than the containing divs. The div contains a randomly selected slogan which can be of various different lengths and of course if the browser window width is small it may make even a short slogan run over two lines.p  pI have shown the problem in a a hrefhttpjsfiddle.nete4effectgko2b3er4 relnofollowjsfiddlea. I have tried every method of pure css that I can think of including negative margins, pseudo elements and transforms, but they only seem to work when the height of the containing div can be guessed or known. That suggests that the only way to achieve what I want is using javascript jquery to establish the height of the div and then use that to give the images either a negative or a positive margin, but I dont know how to achieve that.p  precodeltdiv classslogangt     ltimg srchttpwww.placebear.com150150 altpic 1 classtsimgleftgt ltimg srchttpwww.placebear.com150150 altpic 2 classtsimgrightgtSLOGAN OF VARIOUS LENGTHS, SOME ONE LINE, SOME THREE OR FOURltdivgt  .slogan  backgroundcolor rgba255, 100, 0, 0.3 textaligncenter  displayblock width80 positionrelative floatnone padding2em  margin0.5em auto 1em auto boxshadow0 1px 4px rgba0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0 0 40px rgba0, 0, 0, 0.1 inset borderradius 0.8em zindex6  .tsimgleft, .tsimgright, .tsimgcentre      displayinlineblock     padding0 1em     height150px     borderradius50  .tsimgleft      float left  .tsimgright      float right  codepre

Negative 50027 pThe question is, I dont quite get why double can store bigger numbers than unsigned long long. Since both of them are 8 bytes long, so 64 bits. p  pWhere in unsigned long long, all 64 bits are used in order to store a value, on the other hand double has 1 for sign, 11 for exponent and 52 for mantissa. Even if 52 bits, which are used for mantissa, will be used in order to store decimal numbers without floating point, it still has 63 bits ...p  pBUT LLONGMAX is significantly smaller than DBLMAX ...p  pWHY p  pWhat kind of magic is happening p

Negative 50027 pI am doing a research about finding the unused rules and overridden properties for a website. So in order to prove my research, I have to compare my result with the most precise result, that is from the browser. What I needed is all provided in the style pane in browser developer toolsa hrefhttpimgur.comh5l2DRv relnofollowdevtools screenshota. The style pane displays the rules applied to a DOM, the CSSfile source, and the overridden property. I have tried to create a browser extension, but I didnt find any Browser API for retrieving that information. Did I miss some information about Browser API, such as retrieving applied rules and overridden properties  Or there is another workaround to get that information  Because I needed to compare the results automatically. Any idea would be really appreciated. Thanksp

It has two types of nodes, black nodes and red nodes. Red nodes always have one piece of data and two children, each of which is a black node. Black nodes may have either 1 one piece of data and two children that are red nodes 2 one piece of data and two children that are black nodes or 3 no data and no children i.e., a leaf node. This isnt a precise description of redblack trees but suces for this exercise.p  pWrite a pair of mutually recursive OCaml datatypes that represent red nodes and black nodes in redblack trees.

Negative 50027 pMultitexturing used to be easy and straightforward.

Then all of that got deprecated.p  pIm looking around trying to figure out the Right Way to do it now, but all the tutorials I find, both from official Khronos Group sources and on blogs, all assume that you want to use the same set of texture coordinates for all of your textures, which is a highly simplistic assumption that does not hold true for my use case.p  pLets say I have texture A and texture B, and I want to render the colors from texture B, in the rect coderBcode, using the alpha values in texture A, in the rect coderAcode, which has the same height and width as coderBcode, for simplicitys sake, but not the same Left and Top values, using OpenGL 3, without any deprecated functionality.

Its not a big problem. However if I did the movement in that way I didnt see any effect. Only after adding an additional linep  precodepanel.InvalidateArrange  codepre  pI observed that the object moved left. Im quite sure, that if I would do the same with the wpf codeGridcode, its not necessary to call InvalidateArrange method. So, I am curious why does this happen Dp

Negative 50027 pstrongHere is the problem I am trying to solve. I have had no success solving it. Please help me Any help is appreciated Thanksstrong  p  pConsider the word search problem. The input to this problem consists of three integers m, n, and w, an m  n matrix of letters, and a list of w words. All of the words in the list are hidden inside the matrix of letters forwards, backwards, up, or down, but not diagonally, and the solution to a word search consists of w  2 array containing the row and column of the first letter of each word in the list, where the coordinates appear in the same order as the words. If one of the words in the list does not appear in the matrix of letters, this row of the output may contain any values. If it appears more than once, you may return any of its locations. Design an algorithm to solve the word search problem. Take care not to read past the top, bottom, left, or right of the letter matrix. Hint you may wish to use subarray notation, like letters [a..b, c], to denote words formed by scanning the matrix letters vertically or horizontally.p

Negative 50027 pI am in need of help figuring out a how to set up incbound email with Griddler and Gmail for Work. Ive got a Rails 4 that Im trying to configure to receive incoming emails using Griddler and SendGrid. I followed the instructions on the a hrefhttpsgithub.comthoughtbotgriddler relnofollowGriddler readmea exactly. Next I created a tunnel to my localhost environment using ngrok.io. I then went into the SendGrid web app and created a webhook to catch emails going to codeexample.comcode and send them to the url codeabc123.ngrok.iocode.p  pSo far, I think Ive got the setup correct. Next I set up an MX record in my domains DNS zone file. The host is codecode and it points to codemx.sendgrid.netcode. p  pHere is where things get tricky for me. My site has Gmail for Work set up. Im not super particular on the details, but essentially, I want a way for users to send a message to codefoobar.example.comcode and have it routed to Griddler, rather than Gmail. The format of the email address is not terribly important except that it must be dynamic in the sense that codefoocode can be replaced with anything and it will still be routed to Griddler, as long as the domain is codebar.example.comcode. If the domain is just codeexample.comcode, then it should be routed to Gmail. p  pIve not had much luck finding resources on how to set this up. p  pThanksp

Negative 50027 pMy Angular app uses OAuth for authentication. So, each HTTP request done via Angular Service is intercepted so that the Authorization header is present. This allows for any Ajax requests to my API to be authenticated securely.p  pHow would I authenticate nonAJAX requests to secure images without relying on returning Base64 images from an API. For example, if I linked to an image , there is no way to inject the token in the header. Is there another way to securely pass the token without exposing it on the URLp  pFrom my research, there is no way to authenticate an image request using JWT or tokens without falling back to cookies as cookies are automatically sent for each request. However, I dont want to use cookies and passing the token in the url seems unsecure and bloated.p

Negative 50027 pI want to create an index in elasticsearch that has a field of weighted keywords list, so when I search by term in this keywords   it will give better scores to those documents that has this key with higher weightp  pFor instancep  h2Doc1h2  pid  111 keywords  house20, dog2p  h2Doc2h2  pid  222 keywords  house3, dog40p  pI want when searching dog to get doc2 with higher score.p  pHow would you build the mapping and the queryp  pNote that its different than searching with regular boost, as the boost per each term is different per document.p

Negative 50027 pIm trying to specialise a templatised function inside a templatised class.
