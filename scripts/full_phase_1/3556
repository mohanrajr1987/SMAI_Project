Positive 3556 pI have two lines of simple code.p  precodeint x  12  30 MessageBox.Showx.ToString codepre  pFirst line  I understand that codexcode is an codeinstancecode of type int.p  pSecond line  So, I used the codeToStringcode method of type int.p  pQuestion  p  pHow can I put the value code1230code into the instance codexcode without using the field of int typep  pHow can I get the value code1230code from the instance codexcode without using the field of  int typep  pAm I missing something nowp  pRegards p  pEDIT 1p  pMaybe,, I did not make myself clear enough.p  pId like to shed a light to my question with different direction.p  pFor the first line I heard that the x is an instance of type int. C 5.0 in a Nutshell pg.15 Predefined Type Example. And I thought, an instance can not have any kind of value intstring whatever kind directly. So, I thought it needs a field to put a value. That is my first question.p  pEDIT 2p  pThe 2nd question is basically identical to the 1st question. The instance x has value now somewhere inside of it, I do not know where it is, the value is 360. As you can see it, it make a good result with instance.method style. I thought its style should be field.method. That is my second questionI have some kind of cofusion with 2nd question though.p  pEDIT 3p  pI just made my questions with wondering feelings. I do not want to make any kind of bizarre route to accomplish something. I just wondering how it works nicely even without any FIELD. It is so inconsistent with other types ways of normal working. It is so confusing. p

Positive 3556 pI am using the Jquery Validate plugin.p  pI have a situation with a hidden file form field. I have a button that triggers the file field and allows the user to select an image. An image preview is then show in a div.p  pAll that works fine.p  pI have need to ensure that the file meets the required standards type, size etc. I am trapping all my errors just fine but when i have an erronious value I need to show the error to the user with a highlighted field. The emactualem file field is hidden, therefor the logical thing to do is highlight the div that holds the thumbnail.p  pHighlighting a div is childs play, but I am stumped as to where and how I ascertain whether the specific field has failed validation and therefor manually call my highlight.p  pI thought of using Valid but that calls validate which reruns the validation. I am trying to avoid recalling validate multiple times. However I will take advise on this if multiple calls to validate for custom functionality is considered a valid way of using the validate plugin.p  pAnswers and thoughts greatly received.p

Positive 3556 pIs it possible to use jQuery to duplicate a few form fields text, radio, select The fields would need to be duplicated but have individual IDs from the originals for validation sake.p  pIf the radio field Child Count choice 2 or more is selected, duplicate the previous fields.p  pIm open to suggestions. Im hoping its possible to just add the list item IDs via jQuery rather than having to basically recreate the form via jQuery.

Positive 3556 pFor the sake of simplicity, say I have a private field that caches my collections countp  precodeprivate int count codepre  pI would like to ensure that the count is never below zero. I can check this in the invariantp  precode[ContractInvariantMethod] private void invariant     Contract.Invariantcount gt 0  codepre  pHowever, this is only going to catch the mistake when exiting a public method  not when it happens.

When i finish typing, and hit enter, it jumps to the next title.

I need the script to read title 3 and if it is smaller than the number in field 7 from line 1, then repeat these steps until the sum of the numbers typed for title 3 are equal to the number in field 7 from line 1.p  pThis should repeat for all lines in the file.p  pI could not find helpful information, but am grateful if someone could point me a direction where to find information to accomplish this.

Negative 3556 pI am using successfully custom authorization in ASP.NET MVC. It simply involves a comparison between User.Identity and the owner of the object in context.p  pIt works like a charm when used in simple conditions. It becomes more complicated when I try to call 2 actions in one web request.p  pLets say I want to display an image which would be generated onthefly by my application. This image is generated by a controller, thus, it can be referenced by an URL even if it doesnt exist physically. I have decided that the user must be signed in and be the owner to view it, so I apply my authorization mechanizm to it.p  pExample ltimg srchttpmyapplication.comimagesgenerate3 gtp  pWhen I include such an image in a page via its action hyperlink, I expect that the authenticated user will still be in context on server side when the image is generating. This is not the case in my tests. The image never displays because my authorization check doesnt work. In the image controller, User.Identity is empty as if the user has not signed it.p  pIn the meantime, the same user is still signed in to the website and can continue to browse with his identity in context... without those images working properly.p  pI wonder how to make this process work securely... p  pThank you very muchp  pMarc Lacoursiere RooSoft Computing inc.p

Negative 3556 pI am developing a WPF application and have recently started testing it on a machine with Windows XP Tablet edition. The application runs Full screen. When the computer goes into standby while my application is still running, returning from standby causes the igxprd32 display driver to stop working. When this happens I get a Windows  Display Driver Stopped Responding message, the resolution drops, and the colors get all messed up.p  pInstead of waiting for the computer to go into standby on its own Ive also test manually putting it into standby via the start menu. Bring the computer out of standby after this usually results in Windows crashing with a blue screen. p  pThis only seems to happen on Windows XP Tablet edition. p  pWhat is causing this and how can I fix itp  pEDIT Apparently what I was told was wrong.

Negative 3556 pIm working on a new website, written in VB.Net using ASP.NET MVC2, there is a need to call legacy VB6 code for various complex bits of business logic.  The VB6 is a framework consisting of many dlls and is very stateful, we are pretty much emulating how the framework is used in our client application, ie the application runs lots of state setup, a user logs on even more state and then loads a file even more state.  p  pIve been provided with a web service interface framework to get this up and running for use in the web app, this web framework hides the legacy code behind a thin layer running under IIS.  The idea being that thread pooling provided by IIS will reduce memory use etc etc.  I cant help but believe that the guy who provided this has missed the point, since each instance is so stateful there is no way that a thread pool can work, since once a user logs on using one particular object from the pool, no other object will be capable of servicing that client since it wont have the state   Also, adding a web service interface and associated SOAP marshalling is a huge overhead compared to calling the objects directly.p  pThe only way I can think of doing this is either a single legacy interface instance which is used by all clients and blocked by each call until it completes, or a thread per client with each legacy interface object being created in a new thread and living for the life of the client.  p  pNone of these is ideal but with the amount of code in question and the prolonged migration programme to .net 2 years and still stateful I cant think of an alternative.  We run the original client app in a citrix environment for some customers so I expect that it could also run ok with thread per client given a beefy enough server and that the overheads of the framework itself should be lower than when the client app is involved.p  pAny ideasp

Anyway, Moving onto my main problemem.p  pAssuming the user was added successfully, I now would like their name and email address to be automatically inserted into the original autocomplete field back on the parent page.p  pThis would involve some sort of interaction between frames, something I have no idea about and something Google hasnt been able to help me with either.p  pIs this possible If this is could you please give me an example or point me in the right direction.p  pHere is some code to give you a rough idea of the parent page that calls the fancybox lightbox and ultimately needs the email and name of the newly created user passed back to it.p  precodelttr idclientaddgt  lttdgtBilling Clientlttdgt  lttdgtltinput typehidden value nameclientid gtltinput typetext idaddClient nameclientname value stylewidth 200px gtltredgtltredgt lta classiframe hrefclientsaddlightboxgtltimg srcimages16x16useradd.png border0gt Create New Clientltagt  lttdgt codepre  p Thankyou.p  pTimp

Negative 3556 pCurrently I have set up my application to take advantage of the XAuth implementation of Twitter services via ShareKit. Those that are aware of ShareKit and have implemented it into your own application either for testing purposes or for adding the huge array of services it implements to your application, youd be well are that we have a SHKTwitter.h and .m and an SHKTwitterForm.h and .m which can be found under the Sharers folder in the source code.p  pIt is here that I have started to implement my own TwitLonger support for ShareKit. However, Ive run into a few problems. For those that havent used the TwitLonger API, they only need the Twitter users username to actually send the Tweet. However, I am struggling to pull the entered Twitter username from the SHKTwitterForm.p  pCurrently, after talking to Nate the developer of ShareKit I put together this to pull the username key from the NSMutableDictionary, save to an NSString and then save that into an NSUserDefault object. This is then called when my TwitLonger API implementation kicks in by creating a new NSString built from the NSUserDefault object.p  pIn my SHKTwitter.m I created a subclass of voidauthorizationFormSaveSHKFormController form as directed by Nate. As you can see below, this is what I have.p  precode voidauthorizationFormSaveSHKFormController form     NSMutableDictionary dict  [form formValues]   NSArray keys  [dict allKeys]  NSString usernameString  [[keys valueForKeyusername] componentsJoinedByString]    [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setObjectusernameString forKeytwitternamepreference]  [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] synchronize]  codepre  pHowever, whenever I call this NSUserDefault object into a new NSString in my SHKTwitterForm.m, it returns nil. p  pAnyone have any idea as to how I could achieve this even more simply or am I doing it correctly I feel as though the way that Im grabbing the object in the NSMutableDictionary wrong. Any help would be appreciatedp
Negative 3556 pIn my book, Pro C 2008 and the .NET 3.5 Platform, there is a line of text that is confusing me, within the context of SingleFile assemblies.p  blockquote   pstrongIn a great number of cases, there is a simple onetoone correspondence between a .NET assembly and the binary file .dll or .exe.strong  Thus if you are building a .NET .dll, it is safe to consider that the binary and the assembly are one and the same.  Likewise, if you are building an executable desktop application, the .exe can simply be referred to as the assembly itselfp      pPro C 2008 and the .NET 3.5 platform, Andrew Troelsenp blockquote  pThe first sentence of the quote is messing my thinking up.

Negative 3556 pI am attempting to model a realistic social network Facebook.  I am a Computer Science Graduate student so I have a grasp on basic data structures and algorithms.p  pstrongThe Ideastrongbr I began this project in java.  My idea is to create multiple Areas of Users.  Each User in a given area will have a random number of friends with a normal distribution around a given mean.  Each User will have a large percentage or cluster of Friends from the Area that they belong to.  The remainder of their Friends will be smaller clusters from a few different random Areas.p  pstrongInitial Structurestrongbr I wanted to create an ArrayList of areasbr codeArrayListltAreagt areascode br With each Area holding an ArrayList of Users br codeArrayListltUsergt userscode br And each User holding an ArrayList of Friends br codeArrayListltUsergt friendscode brbr From there I can go through each Area, and each User in that Area and give that user most of their friends from that Area, as well as a few friends from a few random Areas.  This is easy enough as long as my data set remains small.p  pstrongThe problemstrongbr When I try to create large data sets, I get an OutOfMemoryError due to no more memory in the heap.  I now realize that this way of doing it will be impossible if I want to create, say, 30 Areas with 1 millions users per area, and 200 friends per User.  I eat up almost 2gb with 1 Area...So now what.  My algorithm would work if I could create all the users ahead of time, then simply give friends to each user.  But I need the Areas and Users created first.  There needs to be a User in an Area before it can be made a friend.p  pstrongNext Stepstrongbr I like my algorithm, it is simple and easy to understand.  What I need is a better way to store this data, since it cant be stored and held in memory all at once.  I am going to need to not only access the Area a user belongs too, but also a few random areas as well, for each user.p  pstrongMy Questionsstrongbr 1.  What technologydata structure should I be putting this data into.  In the end I basically want a UserFriends relationship.  The Area idea is a way to make this relationship realistic.br 2.  Should I be using a different language all together.  I know that technologies such as Lucene, Hadoop, etc. were created with Java, and are used for large amounts of data...But I have never used them and would like some guidance before I dive into something new.br 3.  Where should I begin  Obviously I cannot use only java with the data in memory.  But I also need to create these Areas of Users before I can give a User a list of Friends.p  pSorry for the semilong read, but I wanted to lay out exactly where I am so you could guide me in the right direction.  Thank you to everyone that took the time to readhelp me with this topic.p

Negative 3556 pHello fellow programmers. I have already asked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5006924isitpossibletousemultithreadingwithoutcreatingthreadsoverandoveragain titleother questionone questiona, but despite the really good answers Ive got I couldnt fix my problem. Then, I took the time to refactor my code in such a way that would improve its parallelization potential by having less calculation batches with more calculation duty each. But still I cant have a better performance than serial processing.p  pI suspect this slow parallel processing is due to the strongcontext switchingstrong. Or maybe its due to strongautomatic synchronizationstrong of common objects. I think you can help me understand whats going on.p  pLet me state my case Im making a program for scientific calculations. It does not depends on external things, just on the input values I give to it at its start. The size of this problem can be measured by codeNscode which is the name I use. It can be seen as the resolution of the solution, it is one of the user inputs, and usually is of the order of 100.p  pIn such way, I have several double arrays in my main class such as double codeys[Ns][N]code or codephiS[Ns][Nord][N]code, where N and Nord are other fixed magnitudes of the program. In my program, I have to calculate several things for each one of the codeNscode points and here comes the parallelization. Each point calculation is independent, so I can divide them to different threads and hope it gets faster.p  pSo, instead of having a loop codefor int i0 iltNs lticode I divided this calculation duty into Runnable batches, each one ranging inside a smaller interval codefor int istart iltend icode, where start and end are allways between 0 and Ns. For example, if Im on a dual core pc, I make two batches, one with codestart  0code and codeend  Ns2code, the other with codestart  Ns2code and codeend  Nscode. If Im on a quad core, the second batch will have codestart  Ns4code to codeend  Ns2code and so on assuming the division is exact at every case.p  pEach Batch, as a class that implements Runnable, is stored in a codeArrayListltBatchgtcode and is given to a codeFixedThreadPoolcode with size equal to the number of cores. It execute the batches and waits for them to finish using a simple codeCountDowncode scheme. p  pEach of this batches needs to access the data on those arrays from the main class of the program, but their access is such that each batch only reads from codeyS[start][]code to codeyS[end][]code and therefore two batches will never try to read the same array element. I wonder if Java still locks up yS, even that each batch isnt trying to access the same elements as others.p  pI wonder also if my problem is related to the overhead due to context switching, as each batch needs to deal with thousands of doubles, and if the way that the program is built can affect it. p  pMaybe I should find a way to pass to each batch just the elements of the arrays that are relevant to it, but I wouldnt know how to approach this. If there were pointers, I could have new arrays of just the desired elements with simple pointer operations and without reallocating anything. Is there a way to do such a thing in Javap  pWell, finally, just to mention There is one part of the code that needs to be synchronized it deals with other arrays and it is already working fine.  This calculation duties Ive described above arent the only thing my program does. They are inside a loop, alternating with sequential processing parts, but are really significant as the total execution time.p  pSo, to summarize, the question is why Im not gaining with multithreading, when I was expecting top  pIve just run here a couple of times the plain serial and the multithread program and got 14500 ms for the serial and 15651 ms for the multithread. Both on the same Dual Core. Other point to notice In serial run, each calculation duty from 0 to Ns takes around 1.1 to 4.5 ms. From the dual threading, each batch Ns2 points takes around 0.5 to 3 ms  measured from the the top to bottom of the run method. Each time of calculation duty differs by its own numerical convergencep  pThanks very much for the attention.p

It totally depends on Excel to view the output file later. 2. Since there is no UI involved, its not easy to write its commandline everytime. 3.

Negative 3556 pIm working on guidance for development of mobile applications in a mainly .Net shop. p  pHow do you tackle the different platforms when developing mobile applications from the perspective of a .Net developer What are advantages and disadvantages of these approachesp  pProbably the simplest approach is to just stick to webbased development HTML5, jquery mobile, etc. But I can imagine this wont be enough for any and all applications.p  pI have looked at a hrefhttpwww.appcelerator.com relnofollowTitaniuma, which claims to be a platform where you develop in JavaScript,  which is then translated to the native platform androidiPhone. The lack of a declarative read xmlbased UI development experience seems like a disadvantage.p  pAnother option could be the monobased stack a hrefhttpwww.monotouch.net relnofollowmonotoucha, a hrefhttpmonodroid.net relnofollowmonodroida, where you dont really have a full crossplatform, develop once, deploy everywhere experience, but you can share your business logic and develop reusing part of your .Net skills and tooling. An additional advantage is that the same approach can be used to target Windows Phone 7.p  pAre there other options Is it worthwile to even try this Whats your experiencep

Negative 3556 pI am using jqgrid in my new project. In a specific case I need to use a select element in the grid. No problem.p  pI define the colModel and the column for example like from wikip  precodecolModel  [   ... namemyname, edittypeselect, editoptionsvalue1One,2Two ,   ... ] codepre  pBut now when I load my data I would prefer the column myname to contain the value 1. This wont work for me instead it has to contain the value One.p  pThe problem with this is that the textpart of the select element is in my case localized in the business layer where the colModel is dynamically generated. Also the datatype for the entity which generates the data via EF 4 may not be a string. Then I have to find the correct localized text and manipulate the data result so that the column myname does not containt an integer which is typically the case but a string instead with the localized text.p  pThere is no option you can use so that when the data contains the value which match an option in the select list then the grid finds that option and presents the text. Now the grid presents the value as a text and first when I click edit it finds the matching option and presents the text. When I undo the edit it returns to present the value again.p  pI started to think of a solution and this is what I came up with. Please if you know a better solution or if you know there is a built in option dont hesitate to answer.

The idea is that he must have some sort of card about caller and see its updates. The problem here is i want to do as less calls to the database as possible, because there can be many dispatchers and operators at the same time.br Ive heard about MQ message brokerslike rabbitMQ, activeMQ, but havent used them yetjust heard, and dont really now if they are applicable in such situation. p  pP.S. hope ive described the question normally.

Negative 3556 pI have a TD that contains two divs. The first div contains text and is visible. The second div contains a textarea and is hidden by default.

When I attempted to put the focus on the textarea after it became visible, the divs would swap visibility again because Im bound to the click event of the TD.

Im able to freely edit and click inside the textarea now, but Im not able to range select any text Im assuming because of the jQuery above.

Negative 3556 pIm simulating a distributed system in which all nodes follow some protocol. This includes assessing some small variations in the protocol. A variation means alternative implementation of a single method. emAllem nodes always follow the same variation, which is determined by experiment configuration only one configuration is active at any given time. What is the clearest way to do it, without sacrificing performancep  pAs an experiment can be quite extensive, I clearly dont want any conditionals. Before Ive just used inheritance, likep  precodeclass Nodeobject      def dumbmethodself, argument          ...          def slowmethodself, argument          ...

I also want other people peeping at the code to understand it with minimal effort. What are your suggestionsp  pstrongEditstrong One thing I failed to emphasize enough for all envisioned use cases, it seems that patching the class upon configuration is good.

Negative 3556 pUsing SQL2008, Im trying to figure out an efficient query to find a row whose date is nearest to a specific target date.p  pThere are obvious inefficient solutions e.g. table scan using a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3599684sqlnearestdateABS and DATEDIFFa which I didnt bother looking at, because my table already has a covering index where the date is the first column.  I can narrow down the results using that index before figuring out exactly which row is nearest. p  pIn theory I should be able to satisfy the query using a single index lookup and then a sequential pull of 2 rows of data from that index.p  pBut so far Ive been unable to find a more optimal solution than this onep  precodeDECLARE target DATETIME  01022011  SELECT TOP 1 Val, Measured FROM     SELECT TOP 1 Val, Measured         FROM tbl         WHERE Measured lt Target         ORDER BY Measured desc    UNION ALL    SELECT TOP 1 Val, Measured         FROM tbl         WHERE Measured gt Target         ORDER BY Measured asc  x ORDER BY ABS DATEDIFF second, Measured, Target codepre  pThis is fast 4 logical reads on the test schema below, 9 logical reads in my realworld table but its still a 2scancount solution. Is there a more efficient solution which only hits this index once  p  pOr is my existing solution good enough because that second index seek will be pulling cached pages accessed by the first seek, meaning it will be so fast that further optimzation even if possible will yield minimal actual perf improvementp  pHeres the schema and some sample data. Both are simplified from my actual schema, although the resulting query plan is the same as my more complex tablep  precodeCREATE TABLE tbl      ID int IDENTITY1,1 PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED NOT NULL,     Measured DATETIME NOT NULL,     Val int NOT NULL  CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IXtbl ON tbl Measured INCLUDE Val INSERT tbl VALUES 20110101 1234,6 INSERT tbl VALUES 20110101 2334,6 INSERT tbl VALUES 20110103 0903,12 INSERT tbl VALUES 20110201 0924,18 INSERT tbl VALUES 20110208 0712,7 INSERT tbl VALUES 20110301 1234,6 INSERT tbl VALUES 20110403 0903,12 INSERT tbl VALUES 20110501 0924,18 INSERT tbl VALUES 20110608 0712,7  insert another few million rows here to compare to my realworld table codepre

Negative 3556 pIm reading in a file which I cant buffer all at once, as its size ranges from 256MB upto 2GB in size.p  pOnce the file is opened, I read a chunk of it into a byte array, say 512 bytes, run a regex over it, and if the pattern is detected, my program makes a note of it.p  pThe problem Im having is that my program is missing a lot of the locations in the file where it should be detecting the pattern.p  pIm 90 sure the problem is that whilst the pattern is there, its not complete, as its going outside the length of the buffer.  The pattern Im looking for is eight bytes in length, so for example, the first four bytes of the pattern are at the last four positions in the array so when it is filled again, the first four bytes of the array are the last four of the pattern.  As such, my regex always fails.p  pIm guessing what I need to do is to fill the buffer, then when it fills it again, retain the last 20 or so bytes in there, so that it will not miss any of the patterns Im looking for.p  pAny advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.p  pTony p

Negative 3556 pIm currently using SmartGWTs SectionStack. I have eight SectionStackSections for this stack. I have the VisibilityMode set to MULTIPLE. Inside each section is a block of text that can vary widely in size. Right now, if I expand all the sections and the content exceeds the height of the stack, it will not be visible. I know I could add scroll bars, but I dont want that. What Id like is for the older open sections to be closed when the expanding of a new section would exceed the total height of the stack. Does anyone have an idea as to how I could go about doing this Thanks in advance.p

Well, ok, it was just a few changes up to that time, so i merged the featured branch to the masterprobably a very bad decision and just changed the master to reflect the previous state. p  pThis meant that i had to delete and change files that were previously ONLY on the featured branch.

The problem is that during the renaming process, when it hits the image input emTheForm.StartDateCal[i].name  StartDateCal  TempCounterem, I get a JavaScript error TheForm.StartDateCal is null or not an object. I cannot figure this one out and its standing in the way of moving on. p  pWhat can I do to try to rename an lt input type  image  p  pBelow is the necessary codep  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodelthtmlgt     ltheadgt     ltheadgt     ltbodygt         ltform nameUpdateSchedule methodpost actionDoSchedule.aspgt             ltinput typehidden nameNumRows value0gt             ltinput typehidden nameRowsAdded value0gt             lttable idClassScheduleTablegt                 lttr idScheduleRow styledisplaynonegt                     lttdgt                         ltinput typetext nameRowNum value0 size1 onclickalertthis.namegt                     lttdgt                     lttdgt                         ltbgtStart Dateltbgt ltinput typetext nameStartDate value onclickalertthis.name size8gtampnbsp                         ltinput typeimage nameStartDateCal srchttpwww.CumminsNorthwest.comATTImgCalendar3.png styleborderstylenone onClickalertname    this.namereturn falsegt                     lttdgt                     lttdgt                         ltinput typebutton valueDel. nameDelRow classsubbuttonb onclickDeleteRowthisgt                     lttdgt                 lttrgt                 lttrgt                     lttd colspan3 styletextalignrightgt                     ltinput typebutton valueAdd Class Date classSubButton onclickAddScheduleRowgt                     lttdgt                 lttrgt             lttablegt         ltformgt     ltbodygt     ltscript languageJavaScriptgt codepre  pstrongJSstrongp  precode    var TheForm  document.forms.UpdateSchedule     var NumRows 0     var RowsAdded 0     function AddScheduleRow         NumRows         TheForm.NumRows.value  NumRows         RowsAdded         TheForm.RowsAdded.value  RowsAdded          var TableRowId  ScheduleRow         var RowToClone  document.getElementByIdTableRowId         var NewTableRow  RowToClone.cloneNodetrue          NewTableRow.id  TableRowId  NumRows          NewTableRow.style.display  tablerow          var NewField  NewTableRow.children          for var i0iltNewField.lengthi             var TheInputFields  NewField[i].children             for var x0xltTheInputFields.lengthx                 var InputName  TheInputFields[x].name                 if InputName                     TheInputFields[x].name  InputName  NumRows                     alertTheInputFields[x].name                                  var InputId  TheInputFields[x].id                 if InputId                     TheInputFields[x].id  InputId  NumRows                 alertTheInputFields[x].id                                                 var insertHere  document.getElementByIdTableRowId         insertHere.parentNode.insertBeforeNewTableRow,insertHere         RenumberRows           AddScheduleRow      function DeleteRowr         var ir.parentNode.parentNode.rowIndex         document.getElementByIdClassScheduleTable.deleteRowi         NumRows         TheForm.NumRows.value  NumRows         RenumberRows           function RenumberRows         var TempCounter  0         for var i0iltRowsAddedi             if TheForm.RowNum[i]                 TempCounter                 TheForm.RowNum[i].name  RowNum  TempCounter                 TheForm.RowNum[i].value  TempCounter                 TheForm.StartDate[i].name  StartDate  TempCounter                 TheForm.StartDateCal[i].name  StartDateCal  TempCounter                              ltscriptgt  lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 3556 pI have an application using a MySql database which is displaying a paginated list of records, to which to which the user is able to add new ones. I know how to get paginated results using LIMIT etc, but the question is how to go a specific page when adding a new record. If the page size is 20, and the user is viewing the first page, and they add a record which is 23rd out of say 100, how do we determine which page to show the user. p  pSo, essentially, given a page size and a specific record, how do I determine which page to show out of the pages. The total pages do NOT include all of the records for the table they belong to, but the criteria for getting them is static.p  hr  pEdit I should have been more specific. The records contain a unique ID field and a string name field. The resultant records are sorted by the name alphabetically. Also, this is a java application.p  pThe only thing I can think of is to select all the desired records sorted by name and then some how find the position in those results of the specific record. From that position the page number could be easily calculated since we know the page size, but Im not sure if they is MySql syntax for getting the position of a record in the results.p  pThe dumb solution would be to just grab them all and then in the application code java, determine the specific records position in all the results. But is seems like their must be a more efficient way. p

Negative 3556 pI have started using VBA classes and I have always tried to write my code such that each class is independent, that is, it has everything it needsconstants, functions, etcinside. Lately, though, this approach has resulted in code duplication since, instead of calling public functions in different modules, I copied some code from the outside world in the same project into a class just to maintain its selfsufficiency. p  pI am considering changing a few classes so that they will be able to access functions, constants, types, etc. from other modules just like any other module can, but something in me is telling me this might not be a good practice. Can somebody tell me that what the little voice is saying is wrong Is there a better approachp  pThanks.p  pUpdatesp  pMy apologies for not providing details earlier. Heres a sample codep  precode Module 1   Public Const INITIALVALUE As String  Start Public Const FINALVALUE As String  End  more constants ...  Public Type SheetLoc    SheetName As String    SheetRow As Long    SheetColumn As Long End Type  more types ...   Module 2   Public Function GetLocationkey As String As SheetLoc     Dim myLoc As SheetLoc     some codes here...        With myLoc       .SheetName  someValue       .SheetColumn  anotherValue       .SheetRow  stillAnotherValue    End With     GetLocation  myLoc  End Function  more module functions   Class Module   some codes...  Public Sub SaveResults     Dim currLoc As SheetLoc      lt using a type defined outside of the class     more declarations ....    some codes here ....

But once I replace my SWF file in the install directory with a new build of my app, I once again have the problem.p  pSo, obviously SOMETHING in the Main.swf doesnt agree with the .exe file, but since there are no error messages or whatever it is extremely hard to figure out what the problem is.p  pThe application runs fine from the IDE, by the way, the problem only occurs when I use it in combination with the captive runtime output.p  pHas anybody ever experienced something similar And how were you able to figure out what was going on Is there some secret place where AIR perhaps logs some errors, or is there a way to convince it to output some kind of error logp
Negative 3556 pTrying to get a chat application using a Server and Multiple clients working at the moment and Im having issues getting the message to appear on all connected clients. Communication is done using Datagrams. The initial issue I discovered in the code below was that the clients were only listening for a response when the were talking to the server, but now that Ive set up a Thread to continually listen to the Server, its still not working correctly. Weirdly, subsequent entries result in previous entries being returned. Hopefully someone can help me out with the logic.p  pClientp  precodepackage Example4Datagrams  import java.io.IOException import java.net.DatagramPacket import java.net.DatagramSocket import

Negative 3556 pI have setup the basic LAMP server on Ubuntu 11.10 and had a few questions about directory structure with web hosting. My requirements are that I would like to host two websites ie www.site1.com and www.site2.com and also that I would like to use the Zend framework.p  pCurrently, the public folder is varwww. Is it common to have a Projects folder somewhere containing all of the web application code which generally will consist of the Zend project folders public, tests, library, etc p  pWhere do you normally store the Zend framework folder I was thinking of just storing in in my  directory and creating a symlink from each projects library folder to the Zend library folder. Is this recommendedfrowned uponp  pIm new to this and just getting setup, but here is what I had in mind so farp  pCreate a projects folder in your home directory . Under there, have your different web apps Projectssite1 and Projectssite2. Create a symlink from varwwwsite1 that points to Projectssite1Public and the same for site2. Setup the virtual hosts file with DocumentRoot set to varwwwsite1 and the same for site2.p  pCan anyone shed any light on the possible pitfalls of this Would this be alright to do Any recommendations I know there are many versions of how you should setup directories here on SO, but couldnt find any answers that addressed these things specifically, so I apologize if this is a repeat.p  pAny help is appreciated.p

Negative 3556 pI am writing a game enginelibrary in which I have an event dispatcher class which dispatches events by calling listener methods of registered event handler classes. One can register an event handlerlistener with the event dispatcher by calling the appropriate dispatcher method.p  pThis obviously leads to some boilerplate code for registering every event handlerand also other aspects of my engine have similar bolierplate code, so I was wondering  how about just using Instrumentation to add in all of the necessary code during loading of the event handler class, so that no explicit registration with the event dispatcher is necessary while coding  the call to the dispatchers register method is added in automatically when the program is run.p  pIt is my understanding that in order to use Instrumentation one should use some bytecode modifier API. I know of two  ASM and BCEL. Which one should I use Obviously, this is a somewhat simple task I am trying to do, so I want the one which is easier to learn and better documented.p  pEDIT Here is a specific example.p  pOriginal event handler classp  precodeHandler indicates this this class should be transformed public class MouseEventHandler implements EventHandlerltMouseEventgt      hidden default constructor     public void handleEventMouseEvent event      ...   codepre  pAfter transformationp  precodeHandler public class MouseEventHandler implements EventHandlerltMouseEventgt      public MouseEventHandler              add this line of code to default constructor         Game.getEventDispatcher.addEventHandlerthis          public void handleEventMouseEvent event      ...   codepre

Negative 3556 pIve developed a Rails 3 application with Devise for registration and login control. I want to be able to modify any users password to one I provide.

I can get it to work on a 800x480 emulator screen by forcing layout margins see XML code below but when I switch to a higher res screen the scrollview will occupy more than 60 of the screen and as a result it covers up some of the information on the background image.

Negative 3556 pI have a multi module web app building with maven. We build the war as per normal and deploy and run on developer machines and local test servers using tomcat.p  pThen we want to deploy the application to the cloud. To do this we create a special version of  tomcat which has all the libraries preloaded and a special version of the war which only has our code. Point here is tomcat is preloaded on the cloud server, the war is uploaded each time it is changed. Currently we are having to manually remove the dependencies from the built war.p  pWhat is the best way for maven to do this Should I build a custom packaging type or maybe run some post build plugin to remove these wars Or something else I think the best way to activate this custom build is via a profile. I did try and remove these dependencies by setting them to codescope  providedcode in the new profile but the transitive dependencies still made it into the war.p

Negative 3556 pI was a moderately successful VB6 programmer by that I mean nothing really complicated, just fairly simple apps for my own use. I am trying to migrate myself to Visual Studio 2010 specifically VB. Oh my gosh, its changed Having had no experience with the interim versions, I feel like I am in way over my head.p  pOne thing that I dont really understand is the relationship between a Visual Basic standalone application i.e., an app that runs on a computer, not on web pages, which is what I have always developed, and a vb.net application. When I use the Visual Studio help functions for specific classes some of the pages say they are for .net features. How can I translate that to just a standalone appp  pI am specifically wanting to create a simple app to capture and display incoming TCP packets from an iPhone app I am developing. That means I need to understand sockets better. It was fairly simple in VB6 Ive done it before, but I really need to do it in 2010.p  pMy apologies for my stupidity. At 58 years old, my mind just doesnt capture new concepts like it used to, especially at the rate at which they speed past.p

Negative 3556 pIve run into an issue using stronga hrefhttpjplayer.org relnofollowjPlayerastrong and I thought after searching a few places that it would be used commonly enough on here and someone is bound to have run into a similar issue.p  pI am using the jPlayer to play through audio files and my users would like the functionality to fastforward and rewind via specific hotkeys. I noticed that jPlayer doesnt offer this functionality out of the box emit only handles fastforward and rewind through clicking on the progress bar currentlyemp  pIdeally  all that would be necessary would be for a single keypress to toggle the fastforwarding or rewinding. When the same key is pressed again, the audio file would begin playing based on the current location.p

When I add that middle ruleset you see in the second sample, the environment variable no longer seems to have any effect.

Negative 3556 pAs far as I can tell only objects that have been loaded into the DOM can be manipulated with selectors. This is illustrated in the example below, when the button is clicked its click handler unsuccessfully tries to select an element in the page to be loaded and change its html before.

Negative 3556 pIm having trouble wrapping my head around Bamboo in my context.  I have functional tests that live in a separate repo from the actual product that is being built.  We are trying to use Bamboo to checkout and build code, run unitintegration tests and if all passes run functional tests.  The requirement here is that the functional tests run on a remote client that talk to the server that checked outbuilt code and ran all unitintegration tests.  I installed a remote agent of this server to run functional tests from set up a command capability in the remote agent.  Problem is I need to start in a different working directory to call my tests. Also once tests are called I need Bamboo to consume those results.  I see its easiest if they are xunit output so i can pass the withxunit to nose but do i jsut move the results to the bamboo working directory on the server and bamboo will automatically parse thosep

Negative 3556 pWhat can be considered a safe number of trianglesvertexes for a WebGL application to work on recent desktopnotebook machines say, bought 2009 or after Im worried about memory, not performance. The more vertexes I can send to WebGL, the better looking the scene will be. For some scenes, it would be nice if I could send 30k triangles some 60k vertexes, due use of triangle strips.p  pDoing a quick calculation, 60k vertexes means a 60k x vec4, where each vec4 is 4 x 8 bytes 8 because Im considering a double for each component. So that gives about 1.9mb of vertex memory. Is that safe for most recent WebGL environmentsp

Negative 3556 pIm switching from a MySQL backend to a PostgreSQL backend and am running into some model inheritance issues. Here is an example of the modelsp  precodeclass Parentmodels.Model    key  models.Charfield...    value  models.Charfield...    contenttype  models.ForeignKeyContentType    objectid  models.CharFieldmaxlength200    contentobject  generic.GenericForeignKeycontenttype, objectid  class Child1Parent    pass   class Child2Parent    pass codepre  pThe reason we have two child classes like this is, were simulating two keyvalue pairs in another model, and wanted to separated them into two tables for an easier lookup. The Generic FKs were also for attaching this to other models. This inheritance setup works fine in MySQL, but when I switched it to PostgreSQL, I get an error when trying to run our tests but syncdb works fine. Its as if Django is OK with the relationship but PostgreSQL doesnt like the SQL being generated. When I look at whats being generated from syncdb I see thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE myappparent  id serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, key varchar200 NOT NULL, value varchar200 NOT NULL, contenttypeid integer NOT NULL REFERENCES djangocontenttype id DEFERRABLE  INITIALLY DEFERRED, objectid varchar200 NOT NULL  CREATE TABLE myappchild1  parentptrid integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES myappparent id DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED  CREATE TABLE myappchild2  parentptrid integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES myappparent id    DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED codepre  pSo everything looks right, then when I run my tests I get thisp  precodeError Database testmyapp couldnt be flushed. Possible reasons  The database isnt running or isnt configured correctly.  At least one of the expected database tables doesnt exist.  The SQL was invalid. Hint Look at the output of djangoadmin.py sqlflush. Thats the SQL this command    wasnt able to run.

Negative 3556 pI am working on my first Java application and I am stuck on this part where I need to populate my combobox with items from a hashmap.p  pI am using Model View Controller approach and trying to populate the combobox from within the GUI. So, after a user clicks on a button, a method gets called which should talk to the controller and request the items for the combobox. Controller should send back the items to the GUI and the combobox can be populated.p  pSo, in one of my model files, I create a hashmap and add items to it via my controller.p  pThe hashmap looks like thisp  precodeHashMapltInteger, Customergt customerRegisterHashMap  new HashMapltInteger, Customergt codepre  pLet us assume that the map is now populated with sample data, according to the Customer class attributes.p  pNow, I guess that I need to implement a method in either the controller or the model itself which iterates through the hashmap above and returns the data collection. p  pI would another assumption, may not be necessary, need too iterate through this data once more, only this time within the GUI class and add items to the combobox, one by one.p  pSo the project looks like this 5 files, Controller, Customerregister, Customer, Frame and a Application file which displays the Frame.p  pThank you very much for any advice.p

Negative 3556 pIm still finding my feet with OOP and I am in a conundrum on how to procede with a design.  I have some files.  They all have headers and they all have data.  There are several 25 or thereabouts file types.  Each file type has a name, a header type, a data format, and a data reader i.e. a method I will write to read the data of a particular file type.  A particular data reader might read data from more than one file type.p  pUltimately, I need data sets.  A data set has all of the above attributes plus all the data read in from the source file, and a couple of other bits of info such as the file name.p  pLike I said, I will have 25 or so file types, and a run of the code might deal with a few hundred data sets.  file types will be very stable.  More might be added as time goes on, but the attributes of existing file types will hardly ever change, and certainly not within the course of a run.  In a data set, the actual data might change with processing, but the attributes of its associated file type will not.p  pThe first step in dealing with a file will be to read its header and figure out what file type it belongs to.  Next, the data set will be constructed by calling the data reader for the appropriate file type.p  pNow, I am stuck on the best way to get the file type attributes into the data set.  Will it be more workable to say that a data set isa file type and let data set inherit from or just simply instantiate file type, or better to say that a data set hasa file type and let file type be a data set attribute  I have to do this in python.  Are there any pythonspecific considerations in answering this question.  Thanks for your help.p

Negative 3556 pIn one of my school works I am required to use a Deterministic algorithm httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDeterministicencryption  to cipher several fields.p  pIn this specific case I have to cipher a table with booleans. This would be fine, except that using a deterministic algorithm to do so is pretty much useless. p  pWhy is that so you may askp  pIt happens that when I cipher per example the value true, I always get the cipher text of AB1 and when I cipher the value false, I always get the cipher text of SQ2. So instead of having a table filled of values true and false I have a table filled with values AB1 and SQ2.  Any attacker will understand immediately that my table stores booleans and it wont take him long to figure that AB1true and SQ2false.p  pThis is what I want to prevent in my homework. To avoid this problem I tried using numbers with certain properties. Per example, a value of true is replace by a prime number, while a value of false is replaced by a nonprime number. Thus, my table will be filled with many different prime numbers and non prime numbers.p  pThis would be an acceptable solution if not for one little thing the number of primes we can calculate is limited it takes REALLY LONG to calculate big primes. In an interval of 10000000 numbers only 664579 are prime only 6.64579 .p  pSo I considered using odd numbers instead of prime numbers, but I am not sure about the quality of odd numbers. I think that an attacker will be able to retrieve the property of oddness from the ciphers and thus make an attack. p  pIs my assumption about oddness correct Are there any other solutions  Do you guys have any ideasp  pI would really appreciate any help or ideas, thx in advance Pedro.p

Negative 3556 pI am working on a intranet project, which uses javascript for client side effectswidgets, like tree, grid, dragging. We are thinking about to use jquerybackbone plus some jquery ui.p  pThe problem is, with great flexibility of jquerybackbone, our low experienced developers are almost certained to make code strongMESSYstrong. And I hate that.p  pTo reduce the chance they can make code messy, I am going to build a serverside program to parse xml those developer will write xml instead of javascript when possible and generate javascript at runtime. By doing this, I can force restriction on the xml. And xml tends to be less messy.p  pBut before jumping into that, I want to ask is there any similar existing framework Preferably the javascript generated also make use of modelviewcontroller pattern.p  pOr what else can I do to prevent the project from being messyp  pps I want to educate the developer.

Negative 3556 pIm asking myself how fast the decryption of AES works. I need a value to be able to estimate the time that brute forcing would need.

Negative 3556 pIm using the Google glog logging system in my project.  Specifically, Im using the following types of statements at various places in my codep  precodeinclude ltgloglogging.hgt CHECKEQfoo,bar ltlt Generic error message LOGERROR ltlt Generic error message LOGFATAL ltlt Generic error message codepre  pThis logging system is important in helping me to stage and verify my code. However, sometimes I farm out production runs of my code to a larger server.  This large production server doesnt have the logging system. Ive tried to build the logging system on this production server, but have run into problems.p  pSo, working on the assumption that I emcannotem use the logging system on the production server, how can I configure things so that the logging commands are inactive on the serverp  hr  pAttempting to solve this problem myself before asking on SO, I tried the following...p  pIn an existing header file named globals.h I definedp  precodeifdef NOGLOG     define MYLOGi,m stdcerr ltlt i ltlt   ltlt m else     include ltgloglogging.hgt     define MYLOGi,m LOGi ltlt m endif codepre  pThen, I can replace code like codeLOGERROR ltlt ab ltlt x ltlt cdcode with codeMYLOGERROR,ab ltlt x ltlt cdcode.  Then, when I build with a command like codemake all CUSTOMDNOGLOGcode, where my gcc compile statements are set up with a variable named codeCUSTOMcode, the glog statements will not get compiled, but instead simple codestdcerrcode statements will get compiled.p  pI ran into two problems with this approach 1 I could not figure out how to get the Eclipse IDE to insert codeCUSTOMcode into the gcc compile statements in the makefile that Eclipse generates and 2 putting the codeinclude ltgloglogging.hgtcode statement inside the codeelsecode body caused lots of error messages like the one below.p  precodeIn file included from usrincludeerrno.h36,                  from usrlocalincludegloglogging.h39,                  from ..globals.h23,                  from ..COMPASS.h11,                  from ..COMPASS.cpp13 usrincludebitserrno.h In function int errnolocation usrincludebitserrno.h43 error expected primaryexpression before , token codepre  pstrongNotestrong For the time being, I just commentedout the codeCHECKEQcode calls, with the thinking that once I figure out how to fix this problem with respect to the codeLOGcode calls, I should be able to easily extend the solution to the codeCHECKEQcode calls.p

Then I calculate the absolute difference, wait for all the threads to finish calculating that, then if the current thread is within the block in the image we care about the absolute difference is added to the sum in global memory with an atomicAdd to avoid a collision during write.p  precodeglobal void gpuCounterKernelpixel cudacurBlock, pixel cudarefBlock, uint32 cudaSAD,  uint32 cudaBlocksize                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         int idx  blockIdx.x  blockDim.x  threadIdx.x                                                                                                                                                                                          int idy  blockIdx.y  blockDim.y  threadIdx.y                                                                                                                                                                                          int id  idx  cudaBlocksize  idy                                                                                                                                                                                     int AD  abs cudacurBlock[id]  cudarefBlock[id]                                                                                                            syncthreads                                                                                                                                                                                       if idx lt cudaBlocksize ampamp idy lt cudaBlocksize                                                                                                                                                                                       atomicAdd cudaSAD, AD                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           codepre  pAnd this is how Im setting up the grid and blocks for the kernelp  precodeint gridsizeX    Blocksize2                                                                                                                                                                                                 int gridsizeY    Blocksize2                                                                                                                                                                                                      int blocksizeX   Blocksize4                                                                                                                                                                                                      int blocksizeY   Blocksize4 dim3 blocksInGridgridsizeX, gridsizeY                                                                                                                                                                                      dim3 threadsInBlockblocksizeX, blocksizeY                                                                                                                                                                               codepre  pThe given program calculates the SAD on the CPU as well and compares our result from the GPU with that one to check for correctness.

Negative 3556 pMy apologies for such a stupid question in advance I thought that we need to divide data set to training and testing in svm and then using training set in order to find the model. Then check the accuracy of this model using testing set.  In libsvm dataset a hrefhttpwww.csie.ntu.edu.twcjlinlibsvmtoolsdatasetsmulticlass.html relnofollowhttpwww.csie.ntu.edu.twcjlinlibsvmtoolsdatasetsmulticlass.htmla some data sets have the training and the testing and the others do not have the training and the testing therefore according to the libsvm guide in libsvm website, the ralated codes are different. For example in svmguide2 dataset there is not specified  testing set. So how we can test the accuracy of model. p

Negative 3556 pemThis is a duplicate question, my apologies everyoneemp  pFirstly, I apologize if this is a simple question, I have been searching for a very long time, and either an answer about this does not exist, the answer I am looking for has been buried under answers to questions about how to convert a string to a byte array, or Im not searching with the right terminology. I have also found a few answers on converting a single hex value into a byte but applying those methods to work with what I want to do doesnt really seem to work very well.p  pWhat I am looking for is not how to convert string to a byte array, rather, I am trying to convert an already in bytes value from a textbox, into something my application will recognize as a byte array. Ill try to explain better with an examplep  precodetextBox.Text  019F314A I want byte[] bytes to equal  0x01, 0x9F, 0x31, 0x4A  codepre  pHopefully that makes sense. Thanks to anyone who can offer any assistancep
Negative 3556 pI got two tables and wondering if its possible to join them into one query.p  pthe script gets a codecatIDcode as GET, it should then list all the subCatsif any and then list the photos that are in the mainCat codecat  catID and subcat  0codep  pcodesubCatscode table isp  pcodeid  parentCat  title  addedBy  date  active  defaultPhotocodep  pcodephotoscode table is codeid  title  description  fileName  fileType  uploadedBy  time  cat  subCatcodep  pI got a pagination script that takes a count and generates a LIMIT to use. Wondering if I can combine this into one query for both tables some how to make pagination easier with what I got already. So one selects the count for both with the join, then another selects the results.p  pAny ideas Really stuck on this.p  pThis is my messy start but it seems like a bad design so farp  precodeltphp     if catInfoResult  dbgtselectSELECT  FROM cats WHERE id  s LIMIT 1, catID              if dbgtnumRows gt 0                      pageTitle  hcatInfoResult[0][title] .

There must be some way to detect arrayness during compiletime, because of following codeboostsharedptrcode takes a pointer as an argument to constructor and its inner structures are initialized somehow using only that information. And somewhere inside codeboostsharedptrcode class there is a structure which decides how to delete memory pointed by codesharedptrcode using codedeletecode or codedelete[]code. p  pActually, Im trying to implement some part of codesharedptrcode, but Im failing at the stage of array recognition.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong Ive finally got it figured out, so Im closing the question.

Negative 3556 pI just re installed xampp on my computer. When I did mysql started fine but Apache didnt, so I changed the port it was using 80 I think and changed it to 88. It then all worked fine. I have just started my laptop this morning which is the following morning from the reinstall and when I go to local host it says chrome could not connect to local host, but Apache and mysql started fine. And it worked fine yesterday. Is it to do with the port change Thanksp

It gets the information to the database when the user fills out the form.

Then you return to the page and fill in the email field and everything is fine. But when I check the database I notice that there is an insertion of an strongidstrong and strongnamestrong for the attempt where the strongememailemstrong was not filled out on the form. Is this normal Or what am I doing wrong. Thanksp

This is how I went about it p  precodeSELECT ID,MAX[Date Adjusted] as LastDate INTO t1temp FROM t1 GROUP BY ID  codepre  pThe above creates a table containing IDs and the corresponding last date when an adjustment was made. The price is not pulled as this would create duplicates.p  pThen the next step is to join the tables p  precodeSELECT a., b.Price as Price1 FROM t1temp LEFT JOIN t2 b ON a.ID  b.ID and a.LastDate  b.EntryDate codepre  pwhich again creates duplicates.p  pI learned all of my SQL from you guys so I am hoping you can help a novice iron out this small dent.p

Basically two rows become one stacked row vector with the label on top, the same vector is one feature vector. As I have multiple activities I need multiple feature vectors per activity to train the SVM. For this example I would ideally get one pd.DataFrame with eight feature rows vectors in it so the data frame will have been reshaped ignoring everything but the actual data contained in colA through colB from 16,4 to 8,8.p  pThis is not amazingly explained I know, so please let know if you need further details, should you be in the mood to help. p  pThanks. p

Negative 3556 pForgive me for being vague, but I was shown this technique by someone and I dont remember what it was called so Ive had a hard time searching for it.p  pWith Rails models and ActiveRecord we can of course run all sorts of queries, however, these can consume a lot of resources and become less and less feasible over time.  The method I was shown was a way of essentially building a query as a chain of methods before actually executing the query.p  pSo something like codeUsers.active.addresscode would set up the query to look for Users where activetrue and where an address is set.  Im not sure what this is called, or where I can learn more about it.p

Negative 3556 pI am trying to move keyboard with the uiviewcontroller when the user is trying to go back using edge swipe and keyboard is there on the controller.  So one solution I found is to animate keyboards superview along with  edge swipe using this functionp  precodeanimateAlongsideTransitionInViewanimationcompletion codepre  pBut for this I need to get superview of the keyboard. So I was adding one dummy inputAccesoryView to it and then using it to get superview. But I do not want to use this method as this seems very brittle. Is there anyway to get reference to directly keyboard or its superview without using inputAccesoryView. Any help will be appreciated as I am stuck badly on this. Have searched a lot but everywhere it is written to use this inputAccessory method.p

I tried searching around to find out how RDP decides what driversettings to use, but have not had much luck.p  pWe have tried the following scenariosp  ul liPrint directly from XP worksli liPrint directly from Win7 worksli liPrint through Citrix from XP worksli liPrint through Citrix from Win7 worksli liPrint through Citrix on thin client worksli liPrint through RDP from XP worksli liPrint through RDP from Win7 failsli liPrint through RDP from thin client failsli liPrint through Citrix from thin client Same one worksli ul  pWhat could cause this behavior, and how do I fix it  Not using RDP is not an option.p
Negative 3556 pI have been trying to rack my brain as to why I cant seem to apply any attributes to my H1 tag... I couldnt get it to work and started trying to put a border around it so I could see where the section was actually at. But I couldnt even get the border to appear on the section. At first thinking that maybe you couldnt put a border round a section because it was possibly more of a metaphorical grouping and not an actual physical grouping...

Negative 3556 pI am developing an Intranet web app and I am using the System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement to query the Active Directory of the current users Windows Identity.

However, when the application is published to our hosting IIS, the Principal is returned but with no user information.

Negative 3556 pI have a root view controller with subview to be wrappers for views of child view controllers. The basic idea is my root controller has a left and right view controller, both present on screen similar to a splitviewcontroller. On load a modal view pops up over the root view controller and asks for details. The modal view then contacts a server, and is dismissed after getting a response. The root controller then adds the child view controllers with the following codep  precode[self addViewControllerself.leftViewController] [self addViewControllerself.rightViewController]  [self addViewself.rightViewController.view ToWrapperself.rightViewWrapper] [self addViewself.leftViewController.view ToWrapperself.leftViewWrapper] codepre  pWhere add view controller isp  precode[self addChildViewControllercontroller] [controller didMoveToParentViewControllerself] codepre  pand addViewToWrapper just adds the view controllers view to the relevant subview of the rootViewController as followsp  precode[[viewWrapper.contentView subviews] makeObjectsPerformSelectorselectorremoveFromSuperview] newSubview.frame  viewWrapper.contentView.bounds newSubview.autoresizingMask  UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight     UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth [viewWrapper.contentView addSubviewnewSubview] codepre  p99 of the time this works fine. Both views appear instantly and viewWillAppear fires in both child controllers. However, occasionally the screen stays white for a brief period and viewWillAppear doesnt fire in the right view controller EDIT and the left.

Negative 3556 pI recently develop a data compression algorithm, old data structure is very redundant, so I design a more appropriate data structure to store these data. For some data, performance is excellent. But now, I need to compute the specific compression ratio, I donot how to solve this Now my answer is strongserializationstrong, that is store old and compressed data structure into the disk, then compare their disk space to compute compression ratio.

Negative 3556 pI am building a plugin for multiple .NET based solutions. The application it self will connect to a database that holds user data and user group data, as well as some configuration files that users create for them selves. The configurations may also be shared between users the owner can share his configurations with another user, and administrators will be able to edit all permissions on all filesmy guess is via some web interface.p  pThe applications that will have access to the functionality of this plugin are using the .NET platform but after that the projects diverge. One is using old win forms, the other WPF for desktop and another is web based using a JavaScript library. All the aforementioned applications are just interfaces for a shared lib that contains actual business logic.p  pMy plugin will be implemented within the shared business logic library. The app will support both username and password authentication as well as windows authenticationif win auth fails the all will ask for username and password to try to access data that way.p  pMy options regarding membership and authenticationauthorization are plentiful and Im not sure of my choice. I can use the Membership library or the new Identity library. I am also sure there are 3rd party libs that are quite good at this stuff but I have yet to hear of them.p  pis there a preferred lib to use or is the choice trivial and i should just start from somewherep

Negative 3556 pWhat I am trying to do is a simple cascading DDL using my database.

In my a hrefhttpplnkr.coeditriOHXe2VTNQWq6AojKEyppreview relnofollownonReacta version of this, the model data fills in the input immediately and the output reflects changes to the input.p  pBecause binding that data in an Angular style is breaking, I tried to have the React components update the model in a more Reactish way.

Negative 3556 pJSFiddle at the bottomp  pIn an application Im developing, the user can map jQuery UI draggable items from a flat list onto a tree where the leaf nodes are jQuery UI droppables. The items from the flat list can be mapped one by one, but a user can also use multiselect to grab an arbitrary number of items and drop them onto the same droppable in one go.p  pWhen the user selects a large number of items, the draggable helper becomes pretty long. This causes problems when trying to drop the items on a node that is near the bottom of the tree.p  pThe behavior Im after is to drop the items on the leaf node droppable that the mouse cursor is currently on. This seems to work in all cases except for when you reach the bottom of the list. The cursor will move down but the draggable will stay where it is it cant go any further. Instead of dropping on the droppable that the mouse cursor is on, the draggable will be dropped on the droppable that is below where the mouse cursor emis expected to be based on the cursorAt attribute, or at least so it seemsem.p  pI have tried a number of settings and alterations but I cannot get a grip on this behavior. Most solutions I find using search point to the codetolerance pointercode setting on the droppable, but I already use that and it doesnt fix the problem. My helper clones the draggable and sets pointerevents none on it, but that doesnt seem to matter either I can just as well remove the helper function and the behavior is the same.p  pIs this a bug Is there a way to fix it Help would be greatly appreciated. Let me know if more info is needed. Thanksp  pJSFiddle reproducing the problem a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net1odvbmah4 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net1odvbmah4ap  pEdit Disclaimer The JSFiddle is the simplest way I could reproduce the problem. Therefore, some things dont exactly work as in the real case. I stuck the droppable container on the bottom to restrict the draggable. In the real case, the list of droppables is scrollable but the draggable cant go beyond the bottom of that list. The resulting behavior is exactly the same. So a small CSS change is not a fix for my real problem p  pSecond edit changing the codecursorAtcode value is not the solution either. In the real case, the draggable can become taller than the screen height, and the tree control with the droppables is almost the full page height.p

Negative 3556 pI am designing an application that incorporates a recommendation system base on user interactions collaborative filtering. The user on his homepage is presented a set of 6 items to interact with. There will be between 50 and 300 items. The following actions are possiblep  ol liclick on an item strong interestli lirefresh an item some interestli liopen a readmore dialog some interestli lidont do anything an move on no interestli ol  pThis data is collected and stored. The system should recommend items of interest to the user. Iam thinking about turning this data into a rating system. p  pOption A if the user clicks on an item, this is translated into a implicit lifetime rating of 5. refreshing an item it a 4 and so on. So my useritem matrix would look like thisp  precode       item 1  item 2  item 3 john   5                 4 jane   4 codepre  pIn this example john has clicked on item 1 and refreshed item 3. The rating can only go up really, i.e. if a user has previously refreshed an item I write a 4 and update only to a 5 if the item is clicked later.p  pOption B each time the user does one of the above actions, Ill increment a scalar value for the item, which means it can grow unbounded.p  precode       item 1  item 2  item 3 john   55       1        30 jane   41       9 codepre  pMaybe this is a problem, since now the numbers are harder to translate into a rating scale from 1 to 10p  pOption C I count every interaction separatelyp  precode       item 1 click  item 1 refresh  item 1 read john   3              1                        jane   1                               1 codepre  pHere the problem is that reading about an item is probably only done once.p  pIndependent of whatever option I choose, my idea is to first find similar users using something like cosine similarity or pearson correlation. Then pick the top 10 to 30 users from that list and compile a toplist of their favorite items. From that list, I will then recommend items that the current user has had little interaction with in the past.p  pIs this something that could work I am worried that finding similar users will eliminate the chance of finding interesting new items for the current user.p

Surely, then, it should also be considered an instancemethod, and should therefore be unpickleable In fact, even still works if I explicitly declare codeXcode and codeYcode to be attributes of the codeTheanoModelcode instance.p  pCan anyone explain whats going on herep  hr  h2Updateh2  pJust to illustrate why I think this behaviour is particularly weird, here are a few examples of some other callable member objects that dont take codeselfcode as the first argumentp  precodefrom joblib import Parallel, delayed import theano from theano import tensor as te import numpy as np  class TheanoModelobject     def initself         X  te.dvectorX         Y  X  te.logX  2.sum         self.theanogetY  theano.function[X], Y         def squarex             return x  2         self.memberfunction  square         self.staticmethod  staticmethodsquare         self.lambdafunction  lambda x x  2  def runniter100     x  np.random.randn1000     model  TheanoModel     pool  Parallelnjobs1, verbose1, predispatchall        not allowed TypeError cant pickle function objects      results  pooldelayedmodel.memberfunctionx for  in xrangeniter        not allowed TypeError cant pickle function objects      results  pooldelayedmodel.lambdafunctionx for  in xrangeniter        also not allowed TypeError cant pickle staticmethod objects      results  pooldelayedmodel.staticmethodx for  in xrangeniter       but this is totally fine     results  pooldelayedmodel.theanogetYx for  in xrangeniter  if name  main     run codepre  pNone of them are pickleable with the exception of the codetheano.functioncodep

Negative 3556 pI would like to use the Facebook Scores API to make a social leaderboard for my iOS game. From the documentation, I saw that it would require to request a publish permission so that I could post scores. The thing is that I dont want to publish to the players wall I simply think its invasive, I just want to use the API backend to store the score, but everything I saw involved posting to the users wall in order to write the score on the backend.p  pHow should I proceed to only write the score without posting it into facebook If this thing exists, can I avoid requiring the publish permissionp  pThanksp

The box itself appears, but no information is displayed inside, it is hidden.p  pBelow is the html outputp  precodelttbody classfilesgt     lttr classtemplateupload fadegt     lttdgt         ltspan classpreviewgtltspangt     lttdgt     lttdgt         ltp classnamegtPriceList.csvltpgt         ltstrong classerror textdanger label labeldangergtltstronggt     lttdgt     lttdgt         ltp classsizegt444.14 KBltpgt         ltdiv classprogress progressstriped active roleprogressbar ariavaluemin0 ariavaluemax100 ariavaluenow100gt         ltdiv classprogressbar progressbarsuccess stylewidth 100gtltdivgt         ltdivgt     lttdgt     lttdgt        ltbutton classbtn red cancelgt            lti classfa fabangtltigt            ltspangtCancelltspangt        ltbuttongt     lttdgt     lttrgt     lttr classtemplatedownload ingt         lttdgt             ampnbsp         lttdgt         lttdgt             ltp classnamegt                 lta hrefhttpsomeserver.comassetspluginsjqueryfileuploadserverphpfilesbackgroundDefault20287129.jpg titlebackgroundDefault 71.jpg downloadbackgroundDefault 71.jpg datagallerygtbackgroundDefault 71.jpgltagt              ltpgt         lttdgt         lttdgt             ltspan classsizegt70.11 KBltspangt         lttdgt         lttdgt          lttdgt     lttrgtlttr classtemplateupload fadegt     lttdgt         ltspan classpreviewgtltspangt     lttdgt     lttdgt         ltp classnamegtPriceList.csvltpgt         ltstrong classerror textdanger label labeldangergtltstronggt     lttdgt     lttdgt         ltp classsizegt444.14 KBltpgt         ltdiv classprogress progressstriped active roleprogressbar ariavaluemin0 ariavaluemax100 ariavaluenow100gt         ltdiv classprogressbar progressbarsuccess stylewidth 100gtltdivgt         ltdivgt     lttdgt     lttdgt         ltbutton classbtn red cancelgt             lti classfa fabangtltigt             ltspangtCancelltspangt         ltbuttongt     lttdgt lttrgt lttbodygt codepre  pand a screenshotp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCbYzJ.png altScreenshot of the outputp  pIve changed the jQuery to the following to upload allow the uploadsp  precodefileupload.fileupload      disableImageResize false,      autoUpload true,      disableImageResize Android.ChromeOpera.testwindow.navigator.userAgent,      maxFileSize 5000000,      previewFileTypes imagegifjpegpng,      acceptFileTypes .gifjpegpngpdfdocdocxcsvi,                   codepre  pand changed the PHP top  precode Defines which files can be displayed inline when downloaded inlinefiletypes gt .gifjpegpngpdfdocdocxcsvi, codepre  pThe files themselves upload and are on the server in the correct size, and also appear in the database correctly, it just seems for some reason in the callback somewhere it is not saying the upload has startedor completed.p  pObviously I cant test if this is normal behaviour either, as the demo site only allows images.p  pAny help on this would be great, obviously its frustrating for users as to whether the file has indeed uploaded.p
Negative 3556 pI have a C code for a simple windows form with 3 buttons.  Button 1 calls R and plots a surface while button 2 plots a contour.

Unfortunately, if I try to do so the app freezes and I cannot go on. So I have added button 3 with the intention to close the R engine if it is running.

Negative 3556 pThere is a requirement in our project to support jdbc timeout feature for Postgres Postgresql driver. we also support Microsoft SQL JTDS driver and MySQl mysql driver. So i want to introduce the loginTimeout as a common feature for all the Databases.p  pWhile going through documentation of the drivers, i found there is a jdbc parameter called loginTimeout supported from both JTDS and Postgresql drivers but not for Msqlp  pa hrefhttpjtds.sourceforge.netfaq.html relnofollowhttpjtds.sourceforge.netfaq.htmlap  blockquote   pstrongemloginTimeoutstrong default  0 for TCPIP connections or 20 for named pipe connections The amount of time to wait in seconds for a successful   connection before timing out. If a TCPIP connection is used to   connect to the database and Java 1.4 or newer is being used, the   loginTimeout parameter is used to set the initial connection timeout   when initially opening a new socket. A value of zero the default   causes the connection to wait indefinitely, e.g.,until a connection is   established or an error occurs. See also socketTimeout. If a named   pipe connection is used namedPipe is true and loginTimeout is   greater than zero, the value of loginTimeout is used for the length of   the retry period when All pipe instances are busy error messages are   received while attempting to connect to the server. If loginTimeout is   zero the default, a value of 20 seconds is used for the named pipe   retry period.emp blockquote  pa hrefhttpjdbc.postgresql.orgdocumentation84connect.html relnofollowhttpjdbc.postgresql.orgdocumentation84connect.htmlap  blockquote   pstrongloginTimeoutstrong  int Specify how long to wait for establishment of a   database connection.

Negative 3556 pI have been writing a project to use several different web services for getting shipping quotes. For the first two services, I had no problem adding them as a service data source by providing the url of the .asmx file for the service.p  pFor the most recent service I was only given a a hrefhttpapi.shipprimus.comwebservicesPrimus.wsdl relnofollowlink to a wsdl filea. I used wsdlanalyzer.com to validate the file which seems to be a hrefhttpswww.wsdlanalyzer.comqualityReportshow1236141927version1 relnofollowcompletely valida. The WSDL fails with the below error message when I attempt to add it to the Visual Studio project as a service data source though. p  precodeThere was an error downloading httpapi.shipprimus.comwebservicesPrimus.wsdlvtibinListData.svcmetadata.

If the service is defined in the current solution, try building the solution and adding the service reference again. codepre  pThe first step I tried was to contact the company offering the service and ask if they could help, but they do not use Visual Studio, so they were of no help trying to add a Visual Studio service.p  pI then began to look around to see if there were other ways to possibly add the service from what I was given. I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4304281createwebserviceproxyinvisualstudiofromawsdlfile14360303thisa question, which is similar, but not exactly the same. There are several other questions regarding WSDL files and adding services to Visual Studio, but none of them have helped me. p  pWhen I try adding the service using a local path to the downloaded WSDL file, as is suggested in the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma143603033897302answer receiving the bountya for the question above, it still does not work albeit with a different error. p  precodeThe document at the url fileCUsersisellarDownloadswebservicesPrimus.wsdl was not recognized as a known document type. The error message from each known type may help you fix the problem   Report from WSDL Document is There is an error in XML document 364, 19..  The element was not expected in this context ltxsdanotation xmlnsxsdhttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemagt..ltxsdanotationgt. Expected elements httpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemaannotation. If the service is defined in the current solution, try building the solution and adding the service reference again. codepre  pIt references what I assume to be a line number although I am not particularly familiar with the output of WSDL Document whatever that is. Neither line 364 nor line 19 of the file has an codeltxsdanotationgtcode element though.p  pI also tried running the file through WSDL.exe as another answer from the above question suggests. With that I got a similar error to the one I received from Visual Studio. I assume Visual Studio just uses the WSDL.exe to process WSDL files since the outputs were almost identical and WSDL.exe is found under Visual Studio in Program Files.p  pWhen I attempt to add the service as a Web Reference I get the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6lrSi.png altPrimus Service as Web Reference Errorp  pAs you can see it correctly grabs the method signatures from the WSDL but claims to have failed with a 404 and not found anything for a different metadata file. p  pI decided to see if the service was even active using a hrefhttpwww.soapui.org relnofollowSoapUIa to connect to the service and it worked without any problems.p  pI am hoping that there is an easy way to fix the WSDL file so Visual Studio can simply import the service to my project as I have done with the other services. p  hr  pstrongImportant Editstrongp  pI have gotten the WSDL to import by changing the line in the Definitions element from what it is above to codexmlnsxsdhttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemaannotationcode by simply adding annotation to the end. p  pThis caused the WSDL to import, but with no generated code in the Reference.cs, I feel so very close to solving this, but yet so far away. I am still hoping that there is a simple change where I can get the WSDL to create a service reference correctly and the Reference code to generate for me as I spent a while already trying to write the code myself in the file without realizing that it would all be erased when Visual Studio tried to incorrectly regenerate the code.p  hr  pstrongAttempting to run modified WSDL through SVCUtil.exestrongp  pI attempted first to run the WSDL through svcutil per Leandros answer since I did not have access to an SVC file for the service. The first run received the same error message as the second code box above. I tried also to run with the modified WSDL that initially imported, but did not generate code from just above.

Negative 3556 pThis seems like it would be a very common scenario, so I am somewhat puzzled at not being able to find support for this in the Google Play services.p  pEssentially, I have a turnbased multiplayer game. It has multiple scenarios that the player can chose to play  either singleplayer or multiplayer. The inviting player of course gets to chose what game he wants to play.p  pHowever, there seems to be no way to communicate to the invited player, what he is being asked to play. Where there are multiple scenarios, the invited player may not be equally willing to play all scenarios, but at present the invited is forced to accept the invitation before being able to see what theyve just said yes to.p  pOr have I overlooked something Alternately, any way to handle this in a smart wayp

Negative 3556 pI would like to ask an opinion on how to speed up the following operation.p  pI have two matrices says A and B with n rows and 3 columns for any row vector of A I want to compare its difference with any row vector of B. So it is a pairwise difference between emallem row vectors of the two matrices. The resulting matrix is then a nn matrix. Then I want to apply a function to any element of this, the biharm function that I wrote in the example. The problem is that, while for small matrices I have no problems, I have the necessity to apply this operation to very large matrices such as 10003. In the sigm function, that I wrote to do that, I first initialize S and then I wrote two annidated for cycles. However, this is slow for large matrices. Does anyone has an idea on how to speed up this I think using apply but I cannot figure out the correct way. Here below a fully reproducible example. Thanks in advance for any advice.

Negative 3556 pSo basically I would like to apply a filter to a binary image that takes a weighted average of the values of the neighboring cells. This part I have set up already.p  pMy problem now is I have an edge in my image which is not the edge of the matrix. I want to take a weighted after of the neighboring elements, but only do so for the particular elements that Im interested in. p  pThere are two approaches that I know of. Either 1 change the weight of the disk filter when the edge is in proximity to the disk or 2 somehow reflectmirror the values near the edge to the other side. The problem with 2 is that my edge is not straight and kind of goes everywhere. p  pHere is an oversimplification of the scenariop  precodebin   [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0          0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0          1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0          1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0          1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0          1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0          0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0          0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]  mask  [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0          0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1          1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1          1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1          1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1          1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1          0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0          0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0] codepre  pI want to apply a filter to codebincode but I only want to take weights of the elements that have a value of 1 in codemaskcode. I cant necessarily mirror codebincode because of the nonlinearity of the edge, so there must be some way to change to weights of the disk filter. For example, if the normal disk filter has 20 elements in it, each one would have a weight of 0.05. But lets say we are right up against a flat edge only half of the values of codebincode in the disk filter have a value of 1 in codemaskcode. Therefore there would be 10 elements, each with a weight of 0.1. Is there a noniterative way to apply a filter like thisp

Negative 3556 pI belong to a team, and I created a Maven entreprise project with the archetype  jbossjavaee6webappearblankarchetype  7.1.3.Finalp  pEverything works fine, and I saved my project to a distant Google code svn repository. I use Eclipse and the Subclipse svn plugin.p  pThe name of the project is Banque, and, on my machine, in Eclipse, I see a project Banque, and subprojects Banqueear, Banqueejb, Banqueweb. These subprojects appear as standard Eclipse projects  for instance a click on Project properties give me the access to Project Facets, I may choose JPA for the Banqueejb project which gives me JPA tools Entities to tables, etc....p  pWhen I save to the svn repository, I have only ear, ejb, and web subprojects in the repository instead of Banqueear, Banqueejb, Banqueweb p  pSo when an other person of the team synchronizes with the svn repository checkout of the project Banque, there is a big problem p  pFirst, we get ear, ejb, and web subprojects so it seems that we get only the name of the modules defined in the main pom.xml, but more importantly these projects are not real Eclipse projects  for instance Project Facets do not appear in the Project properties page, and I cannot enable JPA facets for the ejb project.p  pIs it  a problem of Eclipse metadata   I cannot replace the metadata of the members of the team by mine Thanks.p

Negative 3556 pI have a set of three vectors stored into a 3xN matrix which are entangled e.g. some value in the second row should be in the third row and vice versa. This entanglement is based on looking at the figure in which alpha2 is plotted.

Negative 3556 pI have an MVC site and I want to apply some custom logic such that whenever a user logs in or authentication is confirmed, if their mobile number is not verified, i redirect them to the verification page. I would like this check to only occur wherever authentication is needed on the site. I have tried registering as a global filter but then this check is called every single time any viewaction is done. I have logic in there that can detect whether or not theyre authenticated. I feel like this is a bit of an unnessary overhead and inefficiency...there are lots of controller actions decorated with the [Authorize] attribute and wouldnt want to add another custom attribute to each to get this working nor do i want to write my own custom [Authorize] provider. Are there any options Again, what I would like to happen is whenever a user is authenticated,I would like my logic for phone number verification to occur Thanksp

Negative 3556 pIve come across this strange behavior regarding opening a file in append mode and then attempting to seek to the start of the file.p  pThe code should be selfexplanatory In the second open, I expect to be able to write a string to the beginning of the file and then have codef.tellcode return 5 the number of bytes written at the beginning of the file.p  pThe thing is that in Python 2.6.6 and 2.7.6 the final assert fires but, surprisingly, it works in Python 3.3.2.p  precode Create new file, write after the 100th byte. f  opentest, wb f.seek100, 0 f.writebend assert f.tell  100  lenend f.close   Open file for writing without overwriting, attempt to write at start of file  of the file, but doesnt. f  opentest, ab f.seek0, 0 f.writebstart assert f.tell  lenstart f.close codepre  pSo I made a C program that does the equivalent.

Negative 3556 pWe have an issue where we have a jquery mobile multipage document single page application where a set of divs represent a mobile page.p  pWhen we use the jquery mobiles navigation service.p  precode.mobile.changePagepageId codepre  pFor most divs the pages url anchor changes. Such as for example when we click a menu item the gridViewPage is loaded and its url is changed to a hrefhttplocalhost9090wwwgridViewPage relnofollowhttplocalhost9090wwwgridViewPagea.p  pThe div tag of gridViewPage looks as follows codeltdiv datarolepage idgridViewPage databindwithgridPageViewModelgtcode.p  pHOWEVER the issue comes for another page which is dataValueDetailsPagep  precodeltdiv datarolepage iddataValueDetailsPage datathemea databindwithgridPageViewModel.detailDataValue, visibledashBoardViewModel.isSomeDataExpression dataviewModelDataValuegt codepre  pWhere when the dataValueDetailsPage is switched to using the changePage function the page IS SUCCESSFULLY switched but the url is STILL the previous anchorhash. For example if a button is clicked on the gridViewPage to view the dataValueDetailsPage the url would still be a hrefhttplocalhost9090wwwgridViewPage relnofollowhttplocalhost9090wwwgridViewPagea instead of a hrefhttplocalhost9090wwwdataValueDetailsPage relnofollowhttplocalhost9090wwwdataValueDetailsPagea which should be the url.p  pHowever if we for example navigate back to another screen and then MANUALLY enter the url a hrefhttplocalhost9090wwwdataValueDetailsPage relnofollowhttplocalhost9090wwwdataValueDetailsPagea into the browser the page is successfully loaded and shown.p  pWhen we investigated further into this matter we found out that the issue comes from the following code segment in the jquery mobile libraryp  precode The caller passed us a real page DOM element. Update our  internal state and then trigger a transition to the page. fromPage  settings.fromPage url   settings.dataUrl ampamp .mobile.path.convertUrlToDataUrlsettings.dataUrl       toPage.jqmData url  codepre  pWhen we try to navigate to a page other than dataValueDetailsPage for example gridViewPage in the above code codetoPage.jqmData url code returns gridViewPage note that we dont pass a settings.dataUrl so that is undefined by default. However when we click on a button to go to the dataValueDetailsPage the toPage.jqmData url  does not return dataValueDetailsPage and instead returns undefined.p  pThe thing is that we DO NOT specify anywhere in our page a url attribute. That is for the gridViewPage div there is no url attribute which has the value of gridViewPage. This applies to all page divs.p  pWhen we go further into the codejqmDatacode method we see that the url value is retrieved from the jquery cache .cache.p  pWhen we compare the two cache objects stored in jquery they appear as follows p  pstronggridViewPagestrong object in the jquery cachep  precodemobilePage .widget..anonymous function.anonymous function role page title Some Title url gridViewPage virtualMouseBindings Object proto Object codepre  pstrongdataValueDetailsPagestrong object in the jquery cachep  precodemobilePage .widget..anonymous function.anonymous function role page title Some Title virtualMouseBindings Object proto Object codepre  pNotice that in the first object the url attribute is present. However in the second one the one which does not work does not have the url attribute.p  pIf we MANUALLY type in the anchor url a hrefhttplocalhost9090wwwdataValueDetailsPage relnofollowhttplocalhost9090wwwdataValueDetailsPagea and then go back to the gridViewPage and click the button that takes us to the dataValueDetailsPage the HASHANCHOR WOULD BE THEN SET.p  pWhen we had a quick google we noticed the dataurl attribute. When we set the dataurl attribute to the dataValueDetailsPage div the navigation would then WORK. the related cache object would then be as followsp  purl  dataValueDetailsPagep  pNotice how values such as title is NO LONGER present. It seems that explicitly specifying the dataurl has removed the other default values that were previously stored in the jquery cache.p  pDoes anyone know why the url value is null for just this one div page and is returned for the others. Does anyone also know from where this value is set to the jquery cache as we DO NOT specify it anywhere it is however the same as the id we specify. Additionally we have not used dataurl anywhere for the other divs the hashanchor is created without the dataurl attribute.p  pRegards, Milindap

Negative 3556 pstrongtldrstrong  Is there a way to ensure that a given Rails controller action stops executing when another simultaneous request from the same user comes inp  pIn my RailsAngular app, I make requests to the Foursquare API from the clientside. Because they need to be authenticated, and my authentication information should remain secure, I pass these requests through a Rails controller in my own app. p  pFor a more indepth description of the architecture of this, check out a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions29836102securelymakingauthenticatedapirequestsfromclient2983691729836917this semirelated questiona.p  pMy concern, as elaborated there, is that each request to this internal controller takes up server time and on Heroku, ties up a dyno. Id tried to make the action as fast as possible, but Id still like to reduce the amount the server is tied up.p  pThe amount the server is tied up is exacerbated by the realtime nature of the search Im doing. The request is sent out to my server as a user types, not on enter or anything, because I wanted to allow for autosuggestion.p  pIm debouncing the user input 0.4 seconds, so a the request isnt made til a user briefly stops typing. But if a user pauses a few times while typing, and a request goes out each time, this can quickly cause multiple dynos to get used. p  blockquote   pMore concretely, assuming a roughly 1.3s API response time from Foursquare, imagine this scenario A user types ameri, then waits 0.4 seconds, then types can, then waits 0.4 seconds, then types  beauty, completing their query. This would send three separate requests, all of which would need to be handled by different dynos, because none of the requests have a chance to return before the next comes in. p blockquote  pThis would either cost me a ton of money if I have a bunch of users, that means a large number of dynos to protect against concurrency timeouts or cause really annoying waits on the user front.p  pstrongSo my thoughtstrong would be that it would be awesome if I could essentially do a retroactive debounce on the server side, by terminating any running requests to Foursquare coming from that user before sending a new request out. That would mean that in the above concrete example, while 3 requests started, only the last request would come back, because the first two would be dropped midstream when a new one came in.p  blockquote   pI was thinking of storing some variable in codesessioncode for each that would be true when a request was executing. Then, the next request wouldnt go out if it was triggered. But thats actually sort of the opposite of what I want, because I want the strongoriginalstrong request to get canceled when the new one comes in. I just dont know how to access that request from within the latter on.p blockquote  pThis feels complicated, so Im guessing it may be impossible particularly as each controller action is responded to by a new controller instance, but does anyone know a way to cancel controller actions if the same action is hit by the same user again while the first request is getting resolvedp  pThanksp

And I have not entered it as an array formula i.e. no curly brackets img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFDvrh.png altenter image description herep  hr  pstrongEdit2strong Let me answer the why my current work requires me to have a long list of such large formulas in a spreadsheet. And since they are organised in a list every such formula can only take up one cell. In almost all cases the formulas return single values and hence one cell is sufficient to storedisplay the output. However, when there is an internal error in evaluating the formula, the formula returns an error message. These error messages are usually quite long and are therefore returned as an array of varying size depending on how long the error message is. So my goal was to write a VBA function that would first obtain and then output the full error message for a given selected entry from the list.p

Negative 3556 pIm trying to write a lightbox that shows an image inside a container when a div is being clicked.p  pSaid div has the actual image to be displayed as a background image, working as a thumbnail. p  pThese images will be loaded by users so I dont have their actual width and height.p  pSo I have a bunch of divs with images as background and a lightbox with a container, image with an empty src and description that shows up everytime a thumbnail is clicked.p  pFor that, I used thisp  pSet image and description of lightboxp  precode            var imageToDisplay     this.siblings.selfieImage                                     .cssbackgroundimage                                     .replaceg,                                      .replaceurlig,               var descToDisplay      this.siblings.selfieImage                                     .attrdatadescription              .lightBoxImage.attrsrc, imageToDisplay             .lightBoxDescription.textdescToDisplay codepre  pThe thing is I dont know how long the description is going to be, and the width of the container is not set as it will take the width of its larger element. However, its height will always be the 50 of the screen, so the images will change its original size.p  pI want to set the width of the generated image as the width of the container, so the description text will wrap at the bottom of the image.p  pHow can I do that I read a lot of answers here but none of those seem to work because I already have my lightbox image created with 0,0 dimentions when I load the page. Im just changing its source, so the onload and ready function dont work as expected.p

Negative 3556 pForgive me, Im new to Grunt and I dont typically code PHP. This is a new project for me. Im trying to use Grunt, because its awesome, with some html files that have minimal php in them.  I originally installed the regular grunt, not the php grunt. Now I realize that maybe I should have installed gruntphp. However, I tried deleting the gruntfile.js, installing gruntphp, and then adding the new configurations to a new gruntfile.js but terminal keeps giving me a default not found error, even though the default task is definitely there. I know Im doing something wrong, but I dont know what.  Is it easier to just add php to my original grunt file I dont know how I would do that though.

Negative 3556 pC allows template arguments that refer to template classes, not instances of it.

Negative 3556 pMy colleague discovered that we can often get a performance improvement in our WPF application if we cache WPF controls rather than newing them from scratch. Of course using more memory in general can cause a performance drop somewhere else that would be hard to measure, but we assumed that this would still be worth it because those controls take up insignificant amount of space compared to other things our app deals with.p  pHere is one simple form of a control cachep  precodepublic static class ControlCacheltTgt where T  Visual, new      private static DictionaryltT, boolgt mCache  new DictionaryltT, boolgt      public static T GetInstance              if mCache.Count  0             return new T         else                      var inst  mCache.First             mCache.Removeinst.Key             return inst.Key                    static int MAXCOUNT  300      public static void ReleaseT ctrl              if ctrl  null ampamp mCache.Count lt MAXCOUNT ampamp mCache.ContainsKeyctrl             mCache[ctrl]  true       codepre  pOne of the major draw backs of caching controls is the need to explicitly release them when you are done. Some times you really need to do something pretty awkward to make sure they are detached from their parent in just the right moment. More importantly I feel it goes against the grain of the garbage collected environment. p  pWhat I am looking for is a strategy. How do I detect that a control or an object is not reachable and return it to my cache rather than making the consumer responsible for thatp  pI looked at using a Finilizer to bring the object back from the dead and back into the cache but this practice is generally considered bad for several good reasons. Also it does not exactly do what Id like  it tells me when the object is about to be collected not when it becomes unreachable.p  pWhat is a good wayp

Negative 3556 pIve included some source files from a BSDlicensed library into my program.  I didnt notice a function with this signaturep  precodeclass SomeClass      ...     private     static void initializeFunc attribute constructor     ....  codepre  pFrom a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2053029howexactlydoesattributeconstructorworkthis other stackoverflow questiona it seems that constructor is supposed to make initializeFunc called whenever the library gets loaded by the running binary.  Of course in my case, the source code is compiled into the binary so its not called as a library.p  pNow, someone else in my organization noticed from an oprofile that initializeFunc is being called thousands of times, even if SomeClass is never instantiated or called.  I dont understand this behavior.  Probably I should just remove that attribute and call initializeFunc directly from main. But why in my case isnt it being called exactly once  Can someone help me understand what is going on here  p

Negative 3556 pI recently was asked to look into a possibility of generating a url that would lead to a dynamic page.p  pHere is my use case A client comes onto a page like a hrefhttpwww.example.comcustomvideo relnofollowhttpwww.example.comcustomvideoa here they enter a predefined form with things like company name, adress and upload a image of their logo.p  pAfter that they click on the button make video or whatever and a url is generated that leads to a page where their info is inputted in a page with some css animations.p  pSo I had in mind that all their info will be uploaded to the server in a folder with a generated random number like 10010 and in here all their information from the form will be uploaded in a single info.json file and their logo is resized and uploaded as logo.jpg to that same folder.p  pThe url generated will then be like a hrefhttpwww.example.comcustomvideo10010 relnofollowhttpwww.example.comcustomvideo10010a The url sees the 10010 part, looks up the folder, gets the json file. Inputs the data in the fields I specify on the page and grabs the logo.jpg and places it on the page which then animates CSS.p  pIs this a doable scenariop  pIs something like this even possiblep

Negative 3556 pI am stuck and need some help with organizing my code. The idea is to have jQuery looping 5 select elements. Each select element should have only one answer  selected user answer which is not multiple. As there are 5 select elements, there should be 5 correct answers. I created an array to store the object of correct answers and use it in the loop. It is important to keep the order of the elements  e.g. E flat should be accepted as a correct answer only in select element note1, C sharp  in note2 and so on. I have created a working solution for each correct answer and a separate select element e.g. note1 etc but now I try to make this code dryer in order to avoid copying it several times e.g. 5 and changing only criteria of the correct answer and select element. There is something wrong with my logic. Probably I have to use another array of select elements e.g. [note1, note2, note3, note4, note5] and loop through select elements AND options inside them at the same time. Unfortunately it makes things worse as the number of errors just gets multiplied by 5.  There is something wrong with the way how I iterate through the elements. Thats what I have so far a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netLearnForever2x054ra57 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netLearnForever2x054ra57a.
