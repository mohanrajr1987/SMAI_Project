Positive 608 pIm taking a site that used to be static html generated by an offline tool and converting it to PHP.  Im sending all page urls to a single PHP file which parses the url.  At first I just stuck codeFallbackResource MyPage.phpcode in the .htaccess file, and it worked fine... except for urls with a fragment part.  Many of the old urls were like codesomepage.htmlpart2code, and in the new scheme, part2 is a whole separate page, so I cant ignore that part of the url.  With FallbackResource, all that MyPage.php would ever see is codesomepage.htmlcode.p  pNow Ive read some other questions on here about the topic, such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions371791htaccessredirectwithfragmentthis onea, and it seemed clear that modrewrite should in theory be able to do the job, but I cant get it to work.

It works no better than the old FallbackResource command did.  Ive tried juggling various parts of this in random ways, such as looking for 23 instead of , omitting the NE flag, passing the value in a querystring instead of as a fragment, and whatnot.p  pI will note that I dont want to use redirection to translate the urls  the PHP has to perform a lookup on it.p

Negative 608 p[Warning long post ahead]p  pIve banging my head at this for quite some time now but cant get on a common denominator what is going on. Ive found a solution to workaround, see at the end, but my inner Zen is not satisfied yet.p  pIve a main table with forum messages its from a hrefhttpwww.phorum.org relnofollowPhoruma, simplified looks like this ignore the codeanonuseridcode for the moment, I will get later to itp  precodeCREATE TABLE testmsg    messageid int10 unsigned NOT NULL autoincrement,   status tinyint4 NOT NULL default 2,   userid int10 unsigned NOT NULL default 0,   datestamp int10 unsigned NOT NULL default 0,   anonuserid int10 unsigned NOT NULL default 0,   PRIMARY KEY  messageid  codepre  pMessages can be anonymized by the software, in which case the codeuseridcode is set to code0code. The software also allows posting complete anonymous messages which we endorse. In our case we need to still know which user posted a message, so through the hook system provided by Phorum we have a second table we update accordinglyp  precodeCREATE TABLE testanon    messageid bigint20 unsigned NOT NULL,   userid bigint20 unsigned NOT NULL,   KEY fkuserid userid,   KEY fkmessageid messageid  codepre  pFor the view in the profile, I need to emget the a list of messages from a user, no matter whether theyve have been anonmized by him or notem.p  pA user itself has always the right to see the message he wrote anonymously or later anonymized.p  pBecause codeuseridcode gets set to code0code if anonymized, we cant simply use WHERE for it we need to join with our own second table. Formulate the above into SQL looks like this the codestatus  2code is required, other states would mean the post is hidden, pending approval, etc.p  precodeSELECT  FROM  testmsg AS m LEFT JOIN testanon ON testanon.messageid  m.messageid WHERE testanon.userid  20 OR m.userid  20 AND m.status  2 ORDER BY m.datestamp DESC LIMIT 0,10 codepre  pThis query by itself, whenever the query cache is empty, takes a few second, something along 4 seconds currently. Things get worse when multiple users issue the query and the query cache is empty which just happens people post messages and the cached queries are invalid we faced in our internal testing phase and reports were that the system sometimes slows down. Weve seen queries taking 30 to 60 seconds because of the concurrentness. I dont want to start imagine what happens when we expand our user base ...p  pNow its not like I didnt to any analysis about the bottleneck.p  pI tried rewriting the WHERE clause, adding indice and deleting them like hell.p  pThis is when I found out that when I strongdo not use any index, the query performs lighting fast under certain conditionsstrong. Using no index, the query looks likep  precodeSELECT  FROM  testmsg AS m USE INDEX LEFT JOIN testanon ON testanon.messageid  m.messageid WHERE testanon.userid  20 OR m.userid  20 AND m.status  2 ORDER BY m.datestamp DESC LIMIT 0,10 codepre  pNow here comes the strongcertain conditionstrong the LIMIT limits the result to 10 rows. Assume my complete result coden  26code. Using a codeLIMIT 0,10code to codeLIMIT 16,0code takes strongzero secondsstrong something along lt 0.01s these are the cases were the result is always 10 rows.p  pStarting with codeLIMIT 17,10code , the result will be only 9 rows. Starting at this point, the query starts taking around strongfour secondsstrong again. The is applicable for all results where the result set is smaller then the number of maximum rows limited through codeLIMITcode. Irritatingp  pGoing back to the first CREATE TABLE statement, I also conducted tests without the LEFT JOIN we just assume codeuserid0code and codeanonuseridltthe previous useridgtcode for anonymized messages, in other words, completely bypassing the second tablep  precodeSELECT  FROM testmsg WHERE status  2 AND userid  20 OR anonuserid  20 ORDER BY m.datestamp DESC LIMIT 20,10 codepre  pResult it did strongnot matterstrong. The performance is still within 4 or 5 seconds forcing to not use an index with codeUSE INDEXcode does not speed up this query.p  pThis is were I really got puzzled now. Index will always only be used for the codestatuscode column, the codeORcode prevents other indices from being used, this is also what the MySQL documentation told me in this regard.p  pAn alternate solution I tried do not use the codetestanoncode table to only relate to anonymized messages, but simply to all messages. This allows me to write a query like thisp  precodeSELECT  FROM testmsg AS m, testanon AS t WHERE m.messageid  t.messageid AND t.userid  20 AND m.status  2 ORDER BY m.datestamp DESC LIMIT 20,10 codepre  pThis query always gave me instant results  lt 0.01 seconds, no matter what LIMIT, etc.p  pYes, Ive found a solution. Ive not yet rewritten the whole application to the model though.p  pBut Ild like to better understand what the rational is behind my observed behavior especially forcing no index speeding up queries. On paper nothing looked wrong with the original approach.p  pSome numbers they arent that big anywayp  ul li one million messagesli limessage table data size is around 600MBli limessage table index size is around 350MBli linumber of anonymized messages in codetestanoncode lt 3 of all messagesli linumber of messages from registered users lt 25 of all messagesli ul  pAll tables are MyISAM I tried with InnnoDB but performance was much more worse.p

Negative 608 pI need help with finding my aggregate root and boundary. p  pI have 3 Entities Plan, PlannedRole and PlannedTraining. Each Plan can include many PlannedRoles and PlannedTrainings. p  pSolution 1 At first I thought Plan is the aggregate root because PlannedRole and PlannedTraining do not make sense out of the context of a Plan. They are always within a plan. Also, we have a business rule that says each Plan can have a maximum of 3 PlannedRoles and 5 PlannedTrainings. So I thought by nominating the Plan as the aggregate root, I can enforce this invariant. p  pHowever, we have a Search page where the user searches for Plans. The results shows a few properties of the Plan itself and none of its PlannedRoles or PlannedTrainings. I thought if I have to load the entire aggregate, it would have a lot of overhead. There are nearly 3000 plans and each may have a few children. Loading all these objects together and then ignoring PlannedRoles and PlannedTrainings in the search page doesnt make sense to me. p  pSolution 2 I just realized the user wants 2 more search pages where they can search for Planned Roles or Planned Trainings. That made me realize they are trying to access these objects independently and out of the context of Plan. So I thought I was wrong about my initial design and that is how I came up with this solution. So, I thought to have 3 aggregates here, 1 for each Entity. p  pThis approach enables me to search for each Entity independently and also resolves the performance issue in solution 1. However, using this approach I cannot enforce the invariant I mentioned earlier. p  pThere is also another invariant that states a Plan can be changed only if it is of a certain status. So, I shouldnt be able to add any PlannedRoles or PlannedTrainings to a Plan that is not in that status. Again, I cant enforce this invariant with the second approach. p  pAny advice would be greatly appreciated. p  pCheers, Moshp

Negative 608 pHello everyone and thanks for reading...p  pIm a Mono  Web developer and was recently talking to an Apple guy regarding development on the iPhone and iPad. Now I know that Objective C  XCode is the heavy hitter for development on these platforms however, Im pretty sure he mentioned and showed me a HTML5 application he had created that while basic was mildly functional on his iPad.p  pSkip ahead a couple of weeks and Ive been asked to check out the feasibility of taking of chunks of a clients payperview website and creating a offline version that can be purchased via and presumably distributed by  the Apple app store. Anyhoo, Ive been trying to find 100 confirmation that this is possible and Im turning to dev boards to see whether I can get a definitive answer to the following...p  pCan I create a HTML5 application essentially an offline portion of a clients website for the iPhone  iPad that can be uploaded and distributed by the Apple app storep  pAnd assuming the above is OK are there are restrictions or things I need to be aware of, i.e. it is fairly content rich but will include images and poss a few small videos.p  pThanks p  pSC p

Negative 608 pIm going to implement a view similar to the original photo app in iOS.p  pI created a customized UITableViewCell which has 4 UIButton in it. And it updates the buttons image when the image array of the cell changed.p  pI worked hard to get the performance really satisfying. However, I found a tricky lag problem about it.p  pWhen I use my app normally, the scrolling is very smooth without significant lag. But if I keep the app simulator running on the thumbnail grid view, and switch to other applications in Mac OS. After a while maybe about 1 minute, when I switch back to the simulator, the scroll view gets stuck. Its hard to scroll it. If I click on something switching to another view and then switch back, everything is smooth again. So tricky.p  pI also tried the a hrefhttpsgithub.comklazukaTTRemoteExamples relnofollowcodeTTRemoteExamplescodea which uses codethree20code to implement the grid view. It also gets stuck after switching between different applications in Mac OS not in the iOS.p  pThen I tried not filling the customized cell with UIButton but 4 images. It didnt get stuck. So maybe the reason lies in the conflict between UITableViewCell and UIButtonp  pI dont know if it only happens on simulator or have potential performance problem when shipped to device I havent got the device to test on.p  pApples photo app will never be like this.p  pSo Im going to implement it from UIScrollView by myself to see if the problem is caused by the UITableViews mechanism. I still want to know the reason for the lag if anyone has come to it and solved it.p  pSorry for my poor English, I hope you can catch my meaning.p

Negative 608 pI am working on a Java program that checks XML files for characters that have no glyph representation in a certain font with codeFont.canDisplaycodep  pThe XML files should be utf8 encoded by default. Entities in the XML code are parsed and transformed to a charint value before they get checked by codecanDisplaycode.p  pIn order to provide flexibility, the program accepts two parametersp  ul liThe file name of the XML fileli liA font nameli ul  pI would like to check whether the specified font exists on the system, because otherwise there is not much sense in using codecanDisplaycode.p  pAs far as I understand, Java 6 supports OTF fonts. However, when I use codegetAvailableFontFamilyNamescode from java.awt., it apparently only lists TTF fonts.p  pId like to know whether there is a way to check whether a OTF font given by its name exists. And in general, if using OTF fonts in Java on windows is practical. p  pThe purpose of this We use renderXs XEP to convert xslfo into PDFs. I would like to be able to detect whether the xslfo file contains characters that wont be displayable with a certain font. XEP doesnt give a warning and just prints empty spaces instead of the glyphs. What makes it worse is that it seems to confuse his computation of the spacing for justified text, so lines with those empty spaces are longer or shorter than the current justified block size.p  pI know that there are certain caveats, e.g. I would have to check whether a character is to be displayed regular, italic or bold, and then check for a glyph in that specific font face. But for now a more general approach that checks whether a glyph for a character exists at all in the regular font face would be enough.p

Negative 608 pI am building an mvc 3 application that will be multitenant, which means it will use the same basic data structure, but provide different data depending on the domain name used to access it.p  pA problem I am trying to solve is this.  How best do I populate a number of dropdown lists with selection choices based on the site being rendered.  To add another wrinkle, I will need to localize the strings as well.p  pAn obvious choice is to simply create a table with columns for website id and language id, plus field id and string value.  This seems ok, but also seems to ignore possible mechanisms that are already in place for localization.  I feel like im recreating the wheel here.p  pAs an example, site 1 might have a dropdownlist for Favorite Activities, and have ranges items that are geared toward musical interests.  Site 2 might have the same dropdown, but have items geared for sports intersts.  p  pSo my question is, how would you go about solving this problem  Also, in a similar vein... If you have selection lists, say State codes, cities, etc.. would you tend to create seperate tables to populate this data states table, cities table, etc.. or would you put all this information in a common table and have an ID to indicate which dropdown it was to be used for   The former seems more normalized, but the latter seems more efficient less code to write.p

Negative 608 pI am writing a bouncing ball game in Java for Android phones. Everything seems to work fine apart from a small problem with collisions and the coefficient of restitution.p  pWhen a ball collides with a surface, the vector normal of this surface is calculated nx and ny, and the vector direction of the ball dx and dy is reflected in this normal vector.p  pAt the moment I am then using 0.9 as the coefficient of restitution and so multiplying both dx and dy by this value, which is obviously far too simplistic, as it does not properly simulate rolling.p  pIs there a simple formula to calculate the new dx and dy more accurately, so that if the ball is travelling almost parallel to a slope when it collides it loses less speed than if it collides perpendicularly.p  pApologies for not posting any of my code, Im away from my computer so can post it later if this would help anyones understanding.p  pThanks for any help in advance.p

Negative 608 pIm using p  precodealarmManager.setInexactRepeatingAlarmManager.ELAPSEDREALTIME, 0, DURATION, broadcast codepre  pTo schedule an repeating task that should only be executed if the device is not asleep. As I understand the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comintldereferenceandroidappAlarmManager.htmlAPIa on the AlarmManager the intent will be called once the device wakes up from sleep. p  pNow when is an Android device asleep For testing I set the duration to two minutes and connected the device to my machine. Now Im watching logcat and every two minutes it will spit out my debug message. p  pI always thought that an deactivated screen means that the devices starts sleeping.  Or is my looking at the debug output preventing the device from sleeping  I also disconnected the USB connection and looked at the log after half an hour and I could see a call to my timer code even if the display was dark for more then 15 minutes.p  pHow can I verify from which time the command is not executed anymore and what asleep refers to in the AlarmManager documentation Is there a way to see from the logcat output when the device started sleepingp

Negative 608 pIm trying to transfer data from a DataSet into an Excel workbook. Unfortunately, I need more control than I can get by simply linking to Excel via ADO.NET and using standard SQL to select and insert the data, so Im using excel interop.p  pMy original algorithm involved looping through all the tablesrowsitems of the data set and individually setting the codeFormulacode of each cell in Excel. This worked, but it was taking nearly half a minute to transfer all the data.p  pI decided to try a different solution convert each table to a tabdelimited string using a combination of codeStringBuildercode and codestring.Joincode, copying the string to the clipboard, and using interop to call the Paste command on the Excel codeWorksheetcode object.p  pThis also works and cuts the time by a little more than 50, but Im a little paranoid about using the clipboard to transfer data. What happens if the user starts doing other things involving the clipboard while the transfer is occurring I also wonder if it might be even faster if I could paste a string directly rather than having to use the clipboard as an intermediary.p  pSo, thats my question...strongis there some command available that would allow me to paste a block of data at once in Excel directly from a C string, without without having to use the clipboardstrongp

Negative 608 pI have poured through every question asked on this website related to populating the jqGrid summary footer WITHOUT the userdata being a server request. And the jqGrid wiki resource and just cannot find an answer. Is this possible to dop  pI use the jqGrid in many typical ways as part of my admin portal but have one particular use where I want the look amp feel of the jqGrid to start out as an empty UI container of sorts for some user interaction adding rows through a form which doesnt post on Submit thanks to Olegs great script below but simply adds the row and updates the summary footer with the values from the newly added row. I have summarytypesum in the colModel, groupingtrue, footerrow true, userDataOnFooter true, altRows true, in the grid options but apart from the initial values supplied by the userdata in the local data string, the summary footer values never change. It seems like no one wants to touch this subject. Is it because the primary nature of the jqGrid is its database driven functionality I use about 15 instances of the jqGrid in its database driven stance many of which are in a production service now but need to use it for consistency sake all my UIs are inside jqTabs initially as a client side UI with no server request everything will be saved later to db but I am pulling my hair out trying to manipulate the summary footer programmatically on and by the client only. Can anyone suggest how to cause values to the summary footer to update when a new row is added the values of which would be summed up with any existing rows and which does not involve any posting to server, just updates inside the gridp  pThe code supplied is kind of long and based primarily on user Olegs solution for adding a row from a modal form without posting to the server. Ive changed the local array data to JSON string simply to better understand the notation as Im used to xml. The jsonstring initializes the grid with one default row for the user to edit. Ive left out the jsonReader because the grid would not render with it.p  pIn a nutshell then what I want to do is to have the summary footer update when a new row is added to the grid no posting to server occurring at this point or edited or deleted. When a certain set of values is achieved the user is prompted by a displayed button to save row data to db.p  precodevar lastSel, mydata   total 1, page 1, records 1, rows [ id acmid, cell [0.00,

Negative 608 pIve been using djangosocialauth httpsgithub.comomabdjangosocialauth, with some success  logging in from Twitter and Facebook have been set up without difficulty. However, when I log in from some OpenID providers, I am faced with an empty variable for the username, and the socialauth app allows this despite me having set SOCIALAUTHDEFAULTUSERNAME.p  pWhilst if SOCIALAUTHDEFAULTUSERNAME worked properly that might be an interim solution, ideally Id rather that it was either set automatically from the openID provider. Basically, Im left with two possible solutionsp  p1 Make a custom method to extract some of the extra data sent from the openID provider to set the username from that. 2 Force the user to set a username when they first login.p  pWhilst 2 is less elegant, it ensures that a username has been inserted each time, and also obviates the need to have some postpocessing of the automatic information which may not be in a suitable format for the username.p  pMy question amounts to, how can I go about implementing either of the above Complete answers are not necessary, but pointers to a method would be much appreciatedp  pThe alternative is to play with djangosocialregistration and to see whether that makes life easierp  pJp
Negative 608 pI want to create a File object that returns Line objects when the ReadLine method is invoked instead of just strings. I also want to be able to initialize the File object with either a string containing the absolute path of a text document, or with a list of a strings, and have the resulting instance behave identically in either case. The only way that I could figure out how to do this is by wrapping a File object around either a FileDoc or a FileList object, depending on the input type. Here is an abbreviated version of the solution I have so farp  precodeclass Lineobject     def initself, line, count, fpath         self.text  line         self.count  count         self.fname  fpath.split[1]  class FileBaseobject     def initself         pass      def Openself         self.count  0      def Readlineself         pass      def Getcountself         return self.count      def Setcountself, val         self.count  val  class FileListFileBase     def initself, lines         self.lines  lines         self.Open      def ReadLineself         self.count  1         try             return Linelineself.lines[self.count  1], countself.count  1, fpathlist         except IndexError             raise StopIteration  class FileDocFileBase     def initself, fpath         self.fpath  fpath         self.Open      def Openself         self.count  0         self.file  openself.fpath, r      def ReadLineself         self.count  1         return Linelineself.file.next, countself.count  1, fpathself.fpath  class FileFileBase     def initself, input         if typeinput  type             self.actual  FileDocinput         elif typeinput  type[]             self.actual  FileListinput         else             raise NonRecognizedInputError      def Openself         self.actual.Open      def ReadLineself         return self.actual.ReadLine      def Getcountself         return self.actual.count      def Setcountself, val         self.actual.count  val codepre  pHowever, this seems clunky and nonPythonic as I have to use the Getcount and Setcount methods to access the .count member of the File object, instead of just being able to access it directly with instance.count. Is there a more elegant solution, one which would allow me to access the .count member as a member instead of with getters and settersp  pAlso, for bonus points, Im still trying to figure out the whole inheritance thing. Is there a better way to structure the relationships between the classesp

We need both simple.soy and features.soy because some of the templates in features.soy call the templates in simple.soy.       Note For an example Ant target and command line args that   generates these files, please see target jsfeaturesexample within the toplevel build.xml.p blockquote  pWhat I expected was that it would generate just one JavaScript code base which will use desired strings from the appropriate locale file based on an option provided at runtime before the template function is called.

Negative 608 pI have recently started attempting to develop a web application in Oracle APEX and have come across some issues that have stumped me. Namely having HTML strings stored in the database be parsed as HTML and not simply displayed as text...p  pIn my database which I imported from an Excel spreadsheet, which I had exported from my departments Access database I have two columns Icon and Link. Icon contains an HTML string, codeltimg srcimagesicon.pnggtcode, which denotes what the status of the document in that row is. Link contains another HTML string, codelta hreflink.htmlgtLINKltagtcode, which is unique for each row and links to an exterior HTML page with further information. This database had previously been being exported weekly and converted to HTML manually and put online for upper management to view the status of the documents my team is working on. p  pWhen I heard about APEX I was excited because it looked like it would be a good replacement for our Access database and static HTML reports and forms. I still think that it will be but there are some quirks that I need help figuring out, namely how to have my HTML strings be parsed and displayed instead of just outputed as text.p  pAny thoughts I am relevtively new to APEX but I know SQL.

Negative 608 pI am creating a site where each registered user can store a list of contacts. It occurred to me that rather than storing the contacts in a table with userid, contactname, contactemail, it would be better to normalize it to prevent the same namesemails being stored multiple times. As a result, I now have 4 tables users, names, emails and contacts where contacts contains userid, nameid and emailid. Am I heading in the right direction, or am I complicating things needlesslyp  pThanks for all the helpful responses to what I can see now is a pretty nebulous question. It may be a good idea to explain my reasoning. In an example scenario, where there are 100 users, most of whom have joined though the recommendation of another user, there will be a large number of common email addresses shared by each users contact lists. However, johnsmithemail.com, may be known as John, J Smith, Johnny boy etc. by different users. If I understand the principles of normalization correctly unlikely the separation of user, contact name, and email address in to separate tables, should reduce duplicate entries significantly and make the database more efficient. In the example below, the Contacts table could contain the same email addresses multiple times. So, to cut a long story short, is it better to have more entries than necessary in one table or several smaller tables without duplicate entriesp

Negative 608 pIm wondering how people typically do error handling with backbone.js.  It would be nice for something to popup everytime I call model.save which in turn calls Backbone.sync.  The thing is, how does backbone.js know when an error or a success has occurred on the server  I understand it would know if there was a 500 server error or something like that which jquery knows about since Backbone.sync calls jQuery.ajax  but I want to be able to pass messages and other codes so I can give more meaningful error messages to the user.p  pI have one idea and would love some feedback.  The idea is to override Backbone.sync.  The new sync gets a response from the server, which must be in a particular format.  This format would be something likep  precodeServerResponseObject   gt ResponseCode   gt Message   gt Model codepre  pNothing fancy, but basically, instead of just returning the plain model, it is wrapped up with a codeResponseCodecode and codeMessagecode which can be shown to the user.p  pIs this the normal way to do it  Any other approach that is betterp  pThanksp

Id like to stay away from them using code if thats possible ie any DSL and whatnot. p  pI suppose the easiest way to do this is to give them a set number of textarea responses, so that I can consistently store the data and dont have to hassle around with how to configure storing this data for example, maybe each event can only have exactly 5 responses to be filled in by textfield response by the user.p  pMy ideal would be for the organization to be able to dynamically generate the forms on their own  maybe one questionnaire will have 1 text input, followed by 3 multiple choices, and maybe 2 short answers at the end another one may have 5 multiple choices, and 1 short answer yet another questionnaire might only have 1 text input...you get the idea.p  pSo I see two parts of this problem  the first is the user interface for the organization to create the questionnaire. im imagining this wouldnt be terribly hard  ask them how many of each response type MC, short answer they would like to put into the form, give them the ability to rearrange them, etc.p  pThe second part of the problem what Im more concenred about is how to storeaccess this data. Im guessing theres no dynamicattribute sort of deal in ruby  storing some field with an unspecified number of parts and whatnot. i suppose i could make them all individual models ie a questionresponse model, with question, responsetype, response, etc, but Im fairly certain thats probably inefficient.p  pMy initial guess is probably to serialize the data  use json I worked briefly with Drupal 6 and this seems to be the way they did it. I was wondering if anyone else had any experience  suggestions though Im pretty new to Ruby so I was wondering if theres a gem out there or something that would help with what Im trying to do.p  pThanksp

Negative 608 pIn my program I am simulating a Nbody system for a large number of iterations. For each iteration I produce a set of 6N coordinates which I need to append to a file and then use for executing the next iteration. The code is written in C and currently makes use of codeofstreamcodes method codewritecode to write the data in binary format at each iteration.  p  pI am not an expert in this field, but I would like to improve this part of the program, since I am in the process of optimizing the whole code. I feel that the latency associated with writing the result of the computation at each cycle significantly slows down the performance of the software.p  pIm confused because I have no experience in actual parallel programming and low level file IO. I thought of some abstract techniques that I imagined I could implement, since I am programming for modern possibly multicore machines with Unix OSesp  ul liWriting the data in the file in chunks of n iterations there seem to be better ways to proceed...li liParallelizing the code with OpenMP how to actually implement a buffer so that the threads are synchronized appropriately, and do not overlapli liUsing codemmapcode the file size could be huge, on the order of GBs, is this approach robust enough li ul  pHowever, I dont know how to best implement them and combine them appropriately.p

Negative 608 pI have a stored procedure where I use a Common Table Expression to build a hierarchical path up a menu so it can display something like Parent Menu  Sub Menu  Sub Sub Menu  ...p  pIt works great for what I want to use it for, the issue comes when putting the information I get from the recursive CTE into the information I really want. I do an Inner Join from my Data to the CTE and get out the Hierarchical Path. For something that returns 300 rows, the stored procedure takes on average 1520 seconds.p  pWhen I insert the results from the CTE into a Temp Table and do the join based on that, the procedure takes less than a second.p  pI was just wondering why it takes so long to join using only the CTE, or if I am misusing CTEs in some way.p  pEdit this is the stored procedure essentiallyp  precodeWith HierarchicalPath MenuID, ParentID, Path   As  Select     EM.MenuId, ParentID,              Convertvarcharmax,              EM.Description as Path From     Menu EM Where EM.TopicNo is null     EM.ParentID  0 and EM.Disabled  0 Union All Select       EM.MenuID,               EM.ParentID,              ConvertVarcharmax,E.Path   gt   EM.Description as Path From     Menu EM Inner Join     HierarchicalPath E On     EM.ParentID  E.MenuID       SELECT distinct        EM.Description     ,EMS.Path FROM     dbo.Menu em INNER JOIN     HierarchicalPath EMS ON     EMS.MenuID  em.MenuId     2 more INNER JOINs     2 Left Joins     WHERE Clause codepre  pWhen I run the query like this joining onto the CTE the performance is around 20 seconds.p  pWhen I insert the CTE results into a temp table, and join onto that, the performance is instantaneous.p  pTaking apart my query a bit more, it seems like it gets hung up on the where clause. I guess my question is more to the point of when exactly does a CTE run and does it get stored in memory I was running under the assumption that it gets called once and then sticks around in memory, but under some circumstances could it be called mulitple timesp

Negative 608 pI currently have an ASP.NET website that has an encrypted connection string within its web.config file.  The settings are in the general AppSettings section, not the ConnectionString section.  Within the application code we manually decrypt the connection string at run time as needed.  p  pWhile working on refactoring the site, I came across a method that Microsoft once suggested which involves running an codeaspnetregiiscode command in order to insert encrypted data directly into the ConnectionString section of the web.config file.  This suggested method is now considered Retired Content although it doesnt say why other than a small reference that some of the links may no longer be valid.p  pHeres the site Im referring tobr a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryff647398.aspx relnofollowHow To Encrypt Configuration Sections in ASP.NET 2.0 Using DPAPIap  pMy questions are basically  Should I bother refactoring the existing functionality to use Microsofts once recommended way  I believe it would be more efficient than the current process.  Also, why would this method be considered Retired Content  Is there a better way to do this, rather than my site supporting the encryptdecrypt methodsp  pIve search Google amp StackOverflow for other ways of doing this, but they all seem refer to Microsofts way  or the way I currently have it implemented.p

In my level selection menu for the levels i have ingame, when the player clicks on a level i push back all the enemies for that given level into the vector array. p  pCurrently i only have 3 levels fully done with all their enemies, today when trying todo the forth level, now i keep getting a stack overflow. And im not sure why this is happening, i mean surely the array is only ever assigned anything when i reach first of all reach the level selection menu and then press anything on the keyboard, but no straight away it crashes. p  pSo in terms of pseduo code, heres what i dop  precodeswitchkeyboardInput     ALL keyboard button specific input     default         if levelSelected  1               push back level 1 enemies into vector         elseif levelSelected  2              push back level 2 enemies into vector etc. etc. codepre  pIn terms of numbers that are being push into the vector arrayp  pLevel 1  26 enemiesp  pLevel 2  113 enemiesp  pLevel 3  204 enemies p  pLevel 4  38 enemies emNot even half way finished with creating this levelemp  pTotal  381 enemies. p  pCommenting out a few of the vector push backs that i has just added for the 4th level then has the game running fine. But obviously this is a issue that i need to overcome to allow me to have enemies assigned to the levels. p  pIt crashes on the file emchkstk.asmem for reference.  So im a bit confused by this, why is exactly is this happening is my main question And hopefully how should i overcome this issue p  pAny help greatly appreciatedp  pEdit  So to answer some of the questions, i dont use any sort of recursion in my code and for a greater view of the error, heres a screenshotp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comrDbvL.png altError Returnedp  pI am loading in total 86 images, and 3 fonts. But even commenting a few of those out I still get the same error message above.  The only other thing of any noteworthy would be the actually Enemies class itself. But specifically all that holds is a few variables and a few animations. In total theres 4 animations available per enemy, some have the animation some dont.  Ill post the animation class below  a hrefhttppastebin.comX3GUgJiJ relnofollowhttppastebin.comX3GUgJiJa  Header p  pa hrefhttppastebin.compL1iEkiy relnofollowhttppastebin.compL1iEkiya  .cpp content. p  pEven then though im not sure that theres anything significantly memory hogging there.p  pstrongEdit Twostrong So heres a link to to my level selection code, its quite large. Most of the code itself is gamerelated to the level selection screen and too rendering the correct imagery.  a hrefhttptxtup.coYLVRo relnofollowhttptxtup.coYLVRoap  pstrongEdit Threestrong Commented out all the enemies being pushed back into the vector array leads to surprising results, the level loading code throws up an error, could this just be in result to whatever else is messing up the stack or is it infact the loading code that is messing up the stack Im not sure.  But heres an image of the level error a hrefhttpimgur.com2fySY relnofollowhttpimgur.com2fySYap  pstrongEdit Fourstrong So after a long task of looking through the code, see what perhaps could be causing the issue i think i may have a theory  So each Enemy object has the possibility of havingusing 4 different animations. 5 really but its a long story, theres basically 2 different versions of one animation for different sized enemies.  So if we place that into some figures, these animations are their own class titled Animation. Is it that For every enemy object pushed back into the array will contain its own instance of all the specific Animations that are available, and thus as time has gone on and ive added in more and more enemies the issue unbeknown to me has grown worse and worse. p  pI mean in total that would be em1524em Animation instances, currently i pretty much commented most of the code out. Most of the big things i thought may have been causing the issue, slowly im uncommenting the lines trying things, making sure that this infact correct.  Problem remains now that what should be done p

Negative 608 pI have some bins with different capacities and some objects with specified size. The goal is to pack these objects in the bins. Until now it is similar to the binpacking problem. But the twist is that each object has a partial overlap with another. So while object 1 and 2 has sizes s1 and s2, when I put them in the same bin the filled space is less than s1s2. Supposing that I know this overlapping value for each pair of objects, is there any approximation algorithm like the ones for original binpacking for this problem toop

Negative 608 pWe just upgraded to IIS7 and have had intermittent issues with SESSION variables. In a nutshell a very low percentage of users are getting new SESSION IDs with each page request. Clearing cookies has solved this problem for just about every use Ive come across.p  pMy question is... Is there a way to programmatically do this Its been a lower percentage of calls of people unable to logincant get a certain application to work, so its not a HUGE deal, but we are having to walk people through the process of clearing cookies all day. I havent read of, nor seen a way to force users to clear cookies.p  pMost other questions on here are uses having this issue everywhere, as if there is a programmatic error. Our applications work fine, its just a small percentage of users who used our applications on our old server cant get new session cookies from the new server.p  pWe were running IIS6CF9 and we upgraded to IIS7CF10. This problem is cross browser. We have seen it turn up in IE, FF, and Chrome.p  pEDITp  pIf a user clears cookies and goes to domian.com and then to sub.domain.com, the domain.com cookie takes precedent and the browser I guess never returns the sub.domain.com cookie it gets from the sub.domain.com server. Turning on J2EE cookies on sub.domain.com fixes the issue, I guess, but the clients still run around with a cookie from domain.com. domain cookies is whatever is set by default... i.e. we dont set it to anything in app.cfc. I have no idea how it is set on domain.com.p

Negative 608 pWe have a Winforms application which launches a WPF Dialog which I will refer to as the Wizard.  The purpose of the Wizard is to open a number of text files and save their contents to a database.  The time required to save these files to the DB varies from 15 to 60 seconds.  In order to give the Wizard UI responsiveness, the process of saving the text files to the database is done on a BackgroundWorker thread.  Unfortunately, because of some legacy code in the Winforms host application, the Wizard is totally unresponsive for 80  90 of the time.  For that reason, the Wizard is launched on its own worker thread.  p  pre            PuttheWizardonaseparatethreadtomaintainUI      responsivenessduringtheexportprocess      ThreadtnewThreadLaunchBatchExportWizardView     t.SetApartmentStateApartmentState.STA     t.NameWizardThread     t.Start  pre  pSo in summary we have three principal threads, the Main thread which supports the Winforms host, the Wizard thread and the BackgroundWorker thread.  A user may pause this export process by clicking on a button on the Wizard which sends a CancelAsync message to the BackgroundWorker thread.  Inside the BackgroundWorkerDoWork event handler we check for this cancel message and, if found, discontinue processing and return.  This triggers the BackgroundWorkerRunWorkerCompleted event handler where I can check the identity of the thread to which control has been returned by using Thread.CurrentThread.Name.  p  pThe first time that the user pauses the BackgroundWorker process, control is returned to the Wizard thread.  If the user wants to resume the export process, we call RunWorkerAsync which in turn starts the  BackgroundWorkerDoWork event handler.  From observation I can see that this handler does not use the same thread which it previously used but instead uses a new one from the Thread Pool.  For debugging purposes, I give this thread a name.p  pre      ifThread.CurrentThread.Namenull          Thread.CurrentThread.NameMyBackgroundWorkerThread            threadCounter.ToString     threadCounter       pre  pThe first BackgroundWorker thread is named MyBackgroundWorkerThread1, the second one MyBackgroundWorkerThread2, etc.  p  pLater when the user decides to pause the process again, control is not returned to the Wizard thread in the BackgroundWorkerRunWorkerCompleted event handler as it was the first time but instead to some new thread.  However, this is not fatal and the user can still resume and the export process will pick up where it left off.  p  pThe problem arises, however,  when we try to launch a custom warning dialog in the event that connectivity to the database is lost.  Obviously the Wizard cannot perform its primary mission if it cant communicate with the database.  If we launch this dialog after one or more Pause  Resume cycles, an exception is thrown with the message The calling thread must be STA, because many UI elements require this.   Because of this requirement, the Wizard thread is explicitly set to STA see relevant code above so if the database connectivity loss occurs before any Pause  Resume cycle, everything works just fine.   This new thread, apparently is not STA and accordingly an exception is thrown.  p  pOne option which I tried was to test to see if at the point in time that we want to launch our DatabaseConnectivityLoss dialog we are on the Wizard thread. Since the Wizard thread is an explicitly named thread see code above, I just test to see if the name property of the current thread is nullp  pre        ifThread.CurrentThread.Namenull               ifApplication.Currentnull                  newApplication                  ThreadtnewThreadLaunchDatabaseConnectivityLossDialog         t.SetApartmentStateApartmentState.STA         t.NameNewStaThread         t.Start         pre  pThis works fine to launch the dialog without the previously mentioned exception but when we attempt to resume the export process after connectivity has been restored, the application hangs.  p  pA second thing which I tried was to set a SynchronizationContext variable to hold a reference to the Wizard thread.  It was my understanding that I could use this reference to launch my DatabaseConnectivityLoss dialog on the Wizard thread regardless of what thread was current at any time.  To do this I set this variable in the constructor for the Wizard  p  pre      synchronizationContextSynchronizationContext.Current     ifsynchronizationContextnull     always true in my case because the wizard is a child of a Winforms app     synchronizationContextnewSynchronizationContext       pre  pHowever, when I later tried to use this SynchronizationContext to force my code back on to the Wizard thread, it failsp  pre    synchronizationContext.SendTest,null    privatevoidTestobjectplaceholder  Debug.WriteLineThread.CurrentThread.Name   pre  pThread.CurrentThread.Name usually returns null and in other cases returns NewStaThread.  I dont want to imply that this behavior is intermittent.  It is just that I have tried many different variations and have called this method from many different locations under different circumstances.  p  pIt was my impression that synchronizationContextwas supposed to hold a reference to the Wizard thread and when I call the Send method the callback method should execute on the Wizard thread.  p  pCan anyone see which of my assumptions is invalid, or alternatively suggest an avenue for a solution. p  pConceptually, I believe that either I have to force my application to return from the DoWork handler back to the Wizard thread or, alternatively, to force it back on to the Wizard thread before launching my DatabaseConnectivityLoss dialog.  It is my understanding that I dont have access to the anonymous thread until it is too late to set it to STA which must be done prior to it starting. p

Fundeps do no local propagation.p      pSo in your first definition, youve locally provided codeInt gt acode, which   is acceptable to GHC. Then it figures out externally to the function   that codeFoo Int a gt Int gt acode is actually codeInt gt Floatcode.p      pIn the second definition, youre trying to give codeInt gt Floatcode, but   GHC only knows locally that you need to provide codeInt gt acode with a   constraint codeFoo Int acode which it emwontem use to determine that codea    Floatcode.p      pThis is not inherent to fundeps. One could make a version of fundeps   that has the local constraint rules easily so by translating to the   new type families stuff. But, the difference is also the reason that   overlapping instances are supported for fundeps and not type families.   But I wont get into that right now.p blockquote  pI still dont understand what that mean. So still looking for better understandable answer. p

Negative 608 pIve managed to build a site using the YII framework. I also installed the Bootstrap Extension which allows me to easily implement responsive widgets. My problem comes in with the rest of the site. Lets say I wantp  ul liA headerli liA menuli liMain Contentli liA Footerli ul  pThe menu is the easy part, because I simply use the Bootstrap widget like thisp  precodeltphp       thisgtwidgetbootstrap.widgets.TbMenu, array      typegttabs,  , tabs, pills or list      stackedgtfalse,  whether this is a stacked menu      itemsgtarray        arraylabelgtHome, urlgtarraysiteindex,        arraylabelgtAbout, urlgtarraysitepage, viewgtabout,        arraylabelgtContact, urlgtarraysitecontact,      ,      gt codepre  pSo my question is around making the rest of the site responsive. So Is there an easy way to create blocks that will automatically be responsive too Or is it simply a matter of creating divs and styling it responsively in other words, is the bootstrap extension limited to specific components and therefore the remaining layout relies on the designer to sort out using CSSp

Negative 608 pMy codeContextMenucode shows a weird behaviour when opened again, i.e. rightclicking a second time such that the menu closes and openes again at the new position the menu is part of a codeTabControlcode.p  pBasically, when I rightclick the codeTabControlcode the menu opens normally, but if I rightclick again while the menu is already open, the old one disappears and the new one at the new mouse position blinks once before normally opening. It looks like the menu very quickly openes, then closes, and then opens normally.p  pFirst I thought it might have something to do with another event that is raised while clicking the codeTabControlcode, but removing this event did not help.p  pIf anyone wants some code, please ask.

Negative 608 pI have been doing a lot of searching, and I dont think Ive really found what I have been looking for.  I will try my best to explain what I am trying to do, and hopefully there is a simple solution, and Ill be glad to have learned something new.  p  pstrongThis is ultimately what I am trying to accomplishstrong  Using nosetests, decorate some test cases using the attribute selector plugin, then execute test cases that match a criteria by using the a switch during commandline invocation.  The attribute values for the tests that are executed are then stored in an external location.  The command line call Im using is like belowp  precodenosetests testpath a attributesomeValue codepre  pI have also created a customized nosetest plugin, which stores the test cases attributse, and writes them to an external location.  The idea is that I can select a batch of tests, and by storing the attributes of these tests, I can do filtering on these results later for reporting purposes.  I am accessing the method attributes in my plugin by overriding the wantMethod method with the code similar to the followingp  precodedef setattribsself, method, attribute     if hasattrmethod, attribute         if not self.methodattributes.haskeymethod.name             self.methodattributes[method.name]            self.methodattributes[method.name][attribute]  getattrmethod, attribute  def wantMethodself, method     self.setattribsmethod, attribute1     self.setattribsmethod, attribute2     pass codepre  pI have this working for pretty much all the tests, except for one case, where the test is uing the yield keyword.  What is happening is that the methods that are generated are being executed fine, but then the method attributes are empty for each of the generated functions.p  pBelow is the example of what I am trying to achieve.  The test below retreives a list of values, and for each of those values, yields the results from another functionp  precodeattrattribute1someValue, attribute2anotherValue def sampletestgeneratorself     for key, value in inputdictionary.items         f  partialself.dotest, key, value         f.attribute1someValue         yield lambda x f, key  def dotestself, input1, input2      Some code codepre  pFrom what I have read, and think I understand, when yield is called, it would create a new callable function which then gets executed.  I have been trying to figure out how to retain the attribute values from my sampletestgenerator method, but I have not been successful.  I thought I could create a partial method, and then add the attribute to the method, but no luck.  The tests execute without errors at all, it just seems that from my plugins perspective, the method attributes arent present, so they dont get recorded.p  pI realize this a pretty involved question, but I wanted to make sure that the context for what I am trying to achieve is clear.  I have been trying to find information that could help me for this particular case, but I feel like Ive reached a stumbling block now, so I would really like to ask the experts for some advice.p  pThanks.p  p Update p  pAfter reading through the feedback and playing around some more, it looks like if I modified the lambda expression, it would achieve what I am looking for.  In fact, I didnt even need to create the partial functionp  precodedef sampletestgeneratorself     for key, value in inputdictionary.items         yield lambda self.dotest codepre  pThe only downside to this approach is that the test name will not change.  As I am playing around more, it looks like in nosetests, when a test generator is used, it would actually change the test name in the result based on the keywords it contains.  Same thing was happening when I was using the lambda expression with a parameter.p  pFor examplep  ol liUsing lamdba expression with a parameter      yield lambda x self.dotest, value1li ol  pIn nosetests plugin, when you access the test case name, it would be displayed as sampletestgeneratorvalue1p  ol liUsing lambda expression without a parameter     yield lambda self.dotestli ol  pThe test case name in this case would be sampletestgenerator.  In my example above, if there are multiple values in the dictionary, then the yield call would occur multiple times.  However, the test name would always remain as sampletestgenerator.  This is not as bad as when I would get the unique test names, but then not be able to store the attribute values at all.  I will keep playing around, but thanks for the feedback so farp  h2EDITh2  pI forgot to come back and provide my final update on how I was able to get this to work in the end, there was a little confusion on my part at first, and after I looked through it some more, I figured out that it had to do with how the tests are recognizedp  pMy original implementation assumed that every test that gets picked up for execution goes through the wantMethod call from the plugins base class.  This is not true when yield is used to generate the test, because at this point, the test method has already passed the wantMethod call.p  pHowever, once the test case is generated through the yeild call, it does go through the startTest call from the plugin base class, and this is where I was finally able to store the attribute successfully.  p  pSo in a nut shell, my test execution order looked like thisp  blockquote   pnose  wantMethodmethodname  yield  startTestyieldedtestnamep blockquote  pIn my override of the startTest method, I have the followingp  precodedef startTestself, test      If a test is spawned by using the yield keyword, the test names would be the parent test name, appended by the  character      example  If the parent test is smoketest, the generated test from yield would be smoketestinput     parenttestname  testname.split[0]      if self.methodattributes.haskeytestname         self.testattrib  self.methodattributes[testname]     elif self.methodattributes.haskeyparenttestname         self.testattrib  self.methodattributes[parenttestname]     else         self.testattrib  None codepre  pWith this implementation, along with my overide of wantMethod, each test spawned by the parent test case also inherits attributes from the parent method, which is what I needed.p  pAgain, thanks to all who send replies.  This was quite a learning experience.p

Negative 608 pThis is more a software engineering question than a Python question, but since I am using Python to implement everything, any Python solution is very welcome.p  pI have two classes. One class controls a robot and sends to it commands to perform. Like moving to some position or do some action. The communication between the robot and the computer is USB serial.p  pThe robot has a camera. This camera is connected to the computer using a USB cable. The other class I have receives frames from this camera, and analyzes them.p  pSo I have two classes. One that controls the robot, and one that performs all the image processing.p  pMy initial idea was to have a file main.py, which creates an object for each class, and handles it. I think this solution is too simple, ugly and hard to escale. At the same time, the image processing part requires a continuous loop where the frames are grabbed. This means that I will have to insert my robot code inside the loop. I would this not to happen, and have the classes running on different processes.p  pI am open to any suggestion, like using sockets or anything. I am just starting to implement it so I am very open.p

Negative 608 pIm having some serious problems writing a program that convert prefix to infix.

Im having serious problems visualizing both of those requirements together. Does anyone knows what the algorithm would look like if i could simply have an algorithm, it would really be a life saver.

Normally I would just do this...p  precodewindow.location  httpslocalhost8443Instrideuser1admin codepre  pBut my idea is to create a javascript strongno js frameworks pleasestrong function that could combine the codeajaxcode code with the codewindow.locationcode code. Basically what I would like to accomplish is to create a connection with the server via ajax, send a servlet on that server the url I would like the user to be redirected to, and then redirect the user to that URL. So that for however long it takes the user to connect to my server from wherever they are in the world they see a loading icon instead of a blank white page.p  pSo to clarify exactly what I am trying to accomplish I do not want to put window.location within the success of my ajax function because that would be encompass two round trips, and I do not want to return a huge chunk of HTML for the requested resource and add it to the page. I want to establish a connection to the server with ajax, send a servlet the URL the user wants to go to, and then somehow override the ajax function to redirect that user. Is this possiblep  pAnd I know some of you might think this is stupid but its not when youre talking about overseas users with slow dial up connections staring at white pages. If its possible, Id love to hear some insight. Thank you very muchp

Negative 608 pI would like to place a Progressbar over an Imageview until an image is loaded there using an async task so that the new bitmap will replace the progressbar drawable. I have checked out the Android animation drawable which uses a frame animation. But it didnt work well. What i need is a animated drawable that can be set to an imageview. I am using interfusers coverflow which extends the Gallery class of android. Hence cant use the trivial method of putting the imageview and a progressbar inside a Framelayout and dismissing it when image is loaded. Update Another solution which came to my mind is to use a custom imageview which overrides the Android imageview and override the onDraw to draw a progressbar. Anybody, any ways to achieve that p

Negative 608 pSorry for the wall of text, but I explain the question, include the data, and provide some code p  pstrongQUESTIONstrongp  pI have some climate data that I want to plot using R. I am working with data that is on an irregular, 277x349 grid, where xlongitude, ylatitude, zobservation. Say z is a measure of pressure 500 hPa height m. I tried to plot contours or isobars on top of a map using the package ggplot2, but I am having some trouble due to the structure of the data.p  pThe data comes from a regular, evenly spaced out 277x349 grid on a Lambert conformal projection, and for each grid point we have the actual longitude, latitude, and pressure measurement. It is a regular grid on the projection, but if I plot the data as points on a map using the actual longitude and latitude where the observations were recorded, I get the followingp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvXO3D.png altMap 1p  pI can make it look a little nicer by translating the rightmost piece to the left maybe this can be done with some function, but I did this manually or by ignoring the rightmost piece.

I have some of the parameters for applying the projection from the data source, but I do not know what these parameters mean. Also, I do not know how R handles projections I did read the help files..., so this plot was produced through some trial and errorp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYlYQU.png altMap 3p  pI tried to add the contour lines using the geomcontour function in ggplot2, but it froze my R. After trying it on a very small subset of the data, I found that out after some googling that ggplot was complaining because the data was on an irregular grid. I also found out that that is the reason geomtile was not working. I am guessing that I have to make my grid of points evenly spaced out  probably by projecting it back into the original projection , or by evenly spacing out my data by either sampling a regular grid  or by extrapolating between points .p  pemMy questions areem p  pHow can I draw contours on top of the map preferably using ggplot2 for my datap  pemBonus questionsemp  pHow do I transform my data back to a regular grid on the Lambert conformal projection The parameters of the projection according to the data file include mpLambertParallel1F50, mpLambertParallel2F50, mpLambertMeridianF253, corners, La11, Lo1214.5, Lov253.

Heres that procedurep  precodeprocedure ResizeBitmapBitmap TBitmap Width, Height Integer Background TColor var   R TRect   B TBitmap   X, Y Integer begin   if assignedBitmap then begin     B TBitmap.Create     try       if Bitmap.Width gt Bitmap.Height then begin         R.Right Width         R.Bottom Width  Bitmap.Height div Bitmap.Width         X 0         Y Height div 2  R.Bottom div 2       end else begin         R.Right Height  Bitmap.Width div Bitmap.Height         R.Bottom Height         X Width div 2  R.Right div 2         Y 0       end       R.Left 0       R.Top 0       B.PixelFormat Bitmap.PixelFormat       B.Width Width       B.Height Height       B.Canvas.Brush.Color Background       B.Canvas.FillRectB.Canvas.ClipRect       B.Canvas.StretchDrawR, Bitmap       Bitmap.Width Width       Bitmap.Height Height       Bitmap.Canvas.Brush.Color Background       Bitmap.Canvas.FillRectBitmap.Canvas.ClipRect       Bitmap.Canvas.DrawX, Y, B     finally       B.Free     end   end end codepre  pThe memory leak message is what has me confusedp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNqbaa.png altenter image description herep  pThe codex 3code varies depending on how long its been running, but isnt the number of iterations. For example, the thread may repeat 20 iterations and show codex 3code or may repeat 10 iterations and show codex 7code but I cant even find a pattern of how many leaks compared to how many iterations. It seems this happens at random moments, not on every iteration.p  pSo I went into debugging the codeResizeBitmapcode procedure, but when I run it by its self, even repeatedly and rapidly, I never get any memory leaks. It seems to be something to do with calling it repeatedly from the thread. I know its creatingdestroying an instance of codeTBitmapcode which may not be the best practice, but still, I only get this memory leak when its being called repeatedly from the thread. Im assuming theres a hidden exception out of resources which never actually raises an exception  and thus gets trapped as a memory leak.p  pWhere could this memory leak be coming from How can I prevent itp

Negative 608 pThis might be a simple question for some of you. But I was wondering if a codestdstringcode is a container. By container I mean the containers like for example codestdvectorcode, codestdlistcode and codestddequecode.p  pSince codestdbasicstringltgtcode accepts other types than integral characters, but also is being optimized by working with character arrays. It isnt really clear to me in which category it falls.p  pThis will compilep  precodeinclude ltstringgt include ltiostreamgt  int main      stdbasicstringltintgt intstr     intstr.pushback14     return 0  codepre  pBut by adding this linep  precodestdcout ltlt intstr ltlt stdendl codepre  pIt wont. So by these facts I could conclude that an stdbasicstring was not intended to work with other types than characters.p  pIt might be a strange question for you. The reason I need to know this is because Im working on a framework and Im still not able to determine in which category a string would fall.p

Negative 608 pIm currently taking a look to the new Eclipse RCP framework and have a questions about handlers. In RCP 3.x a handler class needed to implement an interface, so the methods where given. In RCP 4 the handler class doesnt need to implement an interface. Instead you annotate the methods. E.g. if you have an codeExitHandlercode as in a hrefhttpwww.vogella.comarticlesEclipseRCParticle.htmluicomponentsclose relnofollowVogellas Tutoriala you have an codeExecutecode annotation. As you can see, theres an codeIWorkbenchcode parameter passed.p  precodepackage com.example.e4.rcp.todo.handler  import org.eclipse.e4.core.di.annotations.Execute import org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.IWorkbench  public class ExitHandler    Execute   public void executeIWorkbench workbench      workbench.close      codepre  pMy question now is How do I know which parameters are passed when using certain annotations How do I know in this certain case that I get an codeIWorkbenchcode object and not a Window object or something In fact I can annotate a method without a parameter and it will still be executed.p  pIs there documentation somewhere The Eclipse e4 Tools dont seem to support me there either...p
Negative 608 pI have a little problem with boost serialization. There are many examples that shows how to serialize a derived class pointer through the base class pointer by simply using BOOSTCLASSEXPORT and BOOSTCLASSEXPORTIMPLEMENT. This is working fine and have no problems at all.p  pHowever, I do not want to serialize a pointer, as the deserialization in the other side should be again over a pointer and then, boost creates a new instance of the serialized object.p  pI can serialize a dereferenced pointer and then deserialize again over an existing object instance without problems, and no new instances are created. However, when the dereferenced pointer is over the base class, the derived class is not serialized as expected when serializing over pointers.p  pWorking examplep  precodeClass A Class B  public A  A baseClass  new B ar ltlt baseClass  works perfectly codepre  pNot working examplep  precodeClass A Class B  public A A baseClass  new B ar ltlt baseClass  only A is serialized codepre  pI can get it working by simple serializing over the derived class likep  precodeB derivedClass  new B ar ltlt derivedClass  works fine codepre  pBut all the references I have in my structures are of base class type. Also I cannot serialize the pointer as I do not need to instantiate new objetcs when deserializing, only overwrite the contents over an existing instance. p  pI have tried to serialize the pointer and trying to deserialize over an existing instance, but this does not work correctly. When I say deserialize over an existing instance, I meanp  precodeA baseClass  new B  baseClass is used in the program and in a given moment, its contents must be overwrite, so ar gtgt baseClass codepre  pAs I said, I do not need a new instance of baseClass when deserializing. So, is there any way to get this workingp

In rows column I got 13 rows for the subquery version and 18 rows in total for join version. So, have to check against large data to decide what version to use.p  pEDIT Oh, this query with joins turned out to be incorrect, because it groups results by the column p  pEDIT The question is still open. The problem appears when there are duplicates in the second table. As a result, both queries return as many rows as in the second table. But I need just a value per row. Just as I showed from the very first in the example with values a, b, c and d.p  pEDIT Finally, I did it. I added grouping by unique field in the first table and returned the previous grouping.

Negative 608 pTheres a web design trend that Ive been seeing more and more in sites I come across. The thing is, I dont know what its officially called, so I dont know how to look for the topic in web design sites or blogs. Id like to find tutorials and articles regarding tips and best practices, but I havent found any and dont know what people are calling this design style.p  pBasically, its having a long front page or inside pages too with lots of horizontal sections with big images and text. Its sort of like onepage sites, but its not onepage. Its sort of like Parallax, but it doesnt really use the parallax effect not necessarily at least. It also goes very closely handinhand with responsive design, as it shares that long vertical format made for lots of scrolling.p  pA couple of examples of what Im referring to www.marketo.com, www.ginzametrics.com, www.kinhr.comp  pId appreciate any help finding the official name of this, if theres any, or also any related articles or resources.

Negative 608 pI use codeNSMutableDatacode class in my iOS program. I get unbounded memory growth. I use Automatic Reference Counting. When I used allocation instrument, I saw that codeNSMutableDatacodes codeinitWithLengthcode method having Malloc calls in order to allocate memory. Under ARC, memory that is allocated by using codemalloccode should be released by the programmer because ARC doesnt do anything about it. Since I dont know the implementation of codeNSMutableDatacode class, I cant be sure if the memory allocated by codeNSMutableDatacode is released when codeNSMutableDatacode is released. According to the allocations instrument, thats not the case. Does anyone have any knowledge on thisp  pAnother question is when codeNSMutableDatacode codesetLengthcode method is called with smaller size than the current size, then does the extra memory get releasedp

Negative 608 pIm developing on C99 for an embedded environment using GCC. I made a small library to deal with circular buffers and queues. It implements and works on instances of a basic struct which contains a buffer and the needed metadata.p  precodestruct circbufu8st      const uint8t buffernumelems      uint8t head     uint8t tail     uint8t  buffer     codepre  pSometimes the codestructcode is used as a codevolatilecode global, since it is used for communication between an interrupt routine which generates data and the main loop which consumes the data.p  pBut sometimes the codestructcode is used as a noncodevolatilecode local, for example when one part of the main loop generates data to be consumed later on the same main loop.p  pHaving the codestructcode being sometimes codevolatilecode and sometimes not means that any function dealing with the codestructcode needs two versions, for the codevolatilecode and noncodevolatilecode parameter. That is a maintenance problem any change made in one of the versions has to be repeated in the other version. For example, p  precodevoid circbufu8resetstruct circbufu8st cb void circbufu8vresetstruct circbufu8st volatile cbv codepre  pI could just go with the codevolatilecode version of everything, since that will be always correct. But that also implies a pessimization for the noncodevolatilecode case that I would like to avoid.p  pSo, a possible solution would be to declare a codeunioncode with codevolatilecodenon codevolatilecode members, and declare the codestructcode members to have the type of that codeunioncode.p  precodeunion undualvolatileu8      uint8t volatile v     uint8t nv  codepre  pThat would help to get rid of the 2versionsofeachfunction problem. But, does it really help What semantics would could such a function have My understanding is that the compiler will have to use the strictest semantics needed by the codeunioncode, so in fact this would just be a needlessly complicated version of the everythingcodevolatilecode option, with the same pessimization.p  pSo, the questions arep  ul liam I right that the union wont helpli liis there then any way to avoid the function duplication emandem the pessimizationli liwould C help in this kind of situation would function overloading respect the codevolatilecode and noncodevolatilecode semantics or maybe using genericsli ul  plooking at the compiler output is not a valid answer Im looking for a standardbased justification that can be relied uponp  pEDIT I removed the C tag, since the C part of the question was more out of curiosity. And of course C11s generics make the problem easier to solve, but the goal is to solve this in C99.p

Negative 608 pI am running Apache on a Synology 1512. I would like to do some development using python and have chose to use codemodwsgicode to serve. I initially installed codeipkgcode and used that to instal codemodwsgicode. Unfortunately, it seems to have installed python 2.5 and possible another apache instead of using the currently installed Python 2.7 and the running Apache. I decided to just try to compile my own modwsgi, but it appears that I am missing apxsp  pThe following is the error that I receive. I am at a loss for what to do next. Using codeipkgcode or compiling myself are my own two known options.

Negative 608 pIm using pushwoosh to send push notifications to my ios mobile app. I want to allow users to disable notifications from within the app. The problem Im having is that the pushwoosh api uses a different device id for ios than it does for android.

Negative 608 pWe are facing a problem with jQuery event propagation performance connected to mousemovep  pWe have a screen filling canvas and need to track if a user drags the mouse on it, so we have added a mouse move listener on that object like thisp  precodeourCanvas.onmousemove,    functionevent        event.preventDefault       our drag code here      codepre  pThis code works fine, but we had severe performance issues in the current Firefox 24 on one test system. The profiler tells us, that most of the time was spent in codejQuery.event.dispatchcode we tried current latest jQuery 1.8, 1.9, 1.10 and 2.0.p  pWe successfully decreased the time spent in the dispatch function by using the jQuery.event.fix performance optimization here a hrefhttpbitovi.comblog201204fasterjqueryeventfix.html relnofollowhttpbitovi.comblog201204fasterjqueryeventfix.htmla but performance on that test system was still way below what we expected.p  pAfter some further testing, I managed to pin this down on the strongmousestrong used on the system It used strong1000Hzstrong. We switched the used mouse down to 125Hz and voila, the performance was great.p  pOur assumption was, that the high Hz rate on the mouse caused a lot of mousemove events, so we changed the above code to apply an event throttle and only call the event handling every X millisecondsp  precodevar lastMove  0 var eventThrottle  1 ourCanvas.onmousemove,    functionevent        event.preventDefault       var now  Date.now       if now gt lastMove  eventThrottle            lastMove  now           our drag code here             codepre  pAnd it worked like a charme, the performance was great. Even though we only skip two milliseconds of events.p  pNow I have two questionsp  ol lipWe have other locations where we attach mousemove listeners to different HTML elements and strongId like to add this handmade throttle to all of those codemousemovecode handlersstrong to not run into the problem again. Is this somehow possible to do in a nice way in jQuery 2.0.3 Ive seen codepreDispatchcode hooks in the jQuery javascript but they are already after the call to fix which also uses some time and Id like to save that call as well.pli lipI was puzzled by the fact that already an codeeventThrottlecode of 2ms was sufficient to get really good performance so I added a counter to see how many events are being skipped. The surprising result it skips only 01 events... With a throttle of 100ms, the skipped events were in the order of 6070, so strongif there is less than 1 mousemove event per ms, why does this code have such a positive effect after allstrongpli ol  pThanks for any comments, Christopherp
Negative 608 pThere is so much information about JQuery selectors on the net, that Im confused about what is the current stateoftheart regarding JQuery selector performance.p  ul liIs JQuery still evaluating selectors RTLli ul  pRegardless of this, ...p  ul liis codecontext.find.inner still faster than context .innercodeli liis codeli still faster than .classOnAllAndOnlyOnLiElementscodeli ul  pI know I can write my own JSPerf performance evaluation, however, Im scared the kind of DOM tree I would use is not suited for such a test as Im no professional and therefore dont know what things I need to generate, e.g.  DOM tree levels,  of DOM tree elements, etc.p  pHope somebody can answer my questions from a theoretical point of view and by knowing more about the JQuery implementation than by a simple performance evaluation which may only be the answer to one specific DOM tree.p

Negative 608 pI need to get a name of objects instance at runtime. I have a way of doing it but I think there must be a better way.p  pLets say I have 4 forms FormA1, FormA2, FormA2 and DormA4. They all derive from FormA. FormA never gets instantiated  lets say it is virtual.p  pI also have FormB. Each of the FormA children can at runtime, upon certain event, instantiate FormB. FormBs job is to take some information and return it to the form that called it instantiated it at runtime. But without knowing the name of calling forms instance I cant access any of calling forms properties.p  pThe way I currently do it is I have a constructor in FormB that takes a reference to sender as argument using FormA as type, examplep  precodepublic class FormB  Form     private FormA referenceForm     public FormBref FormA callingForm             referenceForm  callingForm      codepre  pthis way I can hale local methods access properties of calling form. Of course to get specific properties I need code reflection so I would get the right type and access to specific properties of children. Alternatively, I think, I could create FormHandler class, instantiate it every time child form gets instantiated and pass values inside events but this may make it more complicated than necessary.p  pstrongSo the question is, how do you get instance name of an object so you can access its propertiesstrongp

Negative 608 pIm curious to know if what Im considering is bad practice, or if since this is a specific and deliberate choice it is actually a decent idea. I want to store information for dates for events that occur in specific cities. I want to store that data as UTC timestamps. Wouldnt it be a good idea to simply store the timestamp and the city idcountry id which is associated with a specific timezone, rather than storing the timezone for each event I ask because timezones can change, but city IDs would never change in the DB. Once the server is synced with the latest timezone in the unlikely event of a timezone change, the event would be independent and unaffected by that change. However, say a timezone changes its boundaries, then events that occurred in that timezone previously could be outside of it. Does it seem unwise to do this Im just wondering, and Ive been scouring for best practices but in this case this actually seems like an OK idea. This works particularly because the application design model would never change events will ALWAYS be associated with a specific city.p  pThe basic flow would bep  ul lipEvent data with datelocation comes into the system in a standard format like ISO8601 YYYYMMDD string.pli lipSystem converts date to UTC timestamp and stores the date with the event using that timestamp and the city ID for the event.pli lipWhen a user requests to view that event, the system pulls the timestamp and city information associated with that event, and uses the citys timezone to format the date accordingly on display.pli ul  pIs this a terrible idea Is there a benefit to this, and is the concept of storing the TZ Offset the same idea to eliminate this issuep

Negative 608 pI have an ASP.NET app that uses the Membership provider. I just copied the app and associated database to a new server, and now I cant log into it. Ive confirmed the database connection string is correct and that the app can talk to the database  the problem is with the Membership provider somewhere.p  pOn both servers the app is set to use ASP.NET 4.0 the old server is running IIS 7.0, and the new is IIS 7.5. The app was copied over using the Web Deploy tool, so its identical on both servers.p  pAfter reading a hrefhttpweblogs.asp.netscottguarchive20060422Alwayssetthe2200applicationName2200propertywhenconfiguringASP.NET2.0MembershipandotherProviders.aspx relnofollowthis blog posta  which seems to describe the problem exactly and indicates the issue could be due to the codeapplicationNamecode attribute being set differently on each server  I checked on the old and new server, and confirmed that the codeapplicationNamecode in config was set to the same value  on both servers  heres the full config entry under codeltmembershipgtcodep  precodeltadd nameAspNetSqlMembershipProvider   typeSystem.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider  connectionStringNameDefault  enablePasswordRetrievalfalse  enablePasswordResettrue  requiresQuestionAndAnswerfalse  requiresUniqueEmailfalse  maxInvalidPasswordAttempts5  minRequiredPasswordLength6  minRequiredNonalphanumericCharacters0  passwordAttemptWindow10  applicationName gt codepre  pI also checked in the aspnetApplications table, and there is a single record with ApplicationName and LoweredApplicationName  so the codeapplicationNamecode value from the config file is being honoured.p  pMy next thought was that somehow the passwords are being encrypted using the machineKey for the old server, which is different to the machineKey on the new server. However, as you can see in the above config entry, the codepasswordFormatcode key is not set in config on either server. I couldnt find any documentation to indicate the default value of this attribute, but on the database table aspnetMembership, every record has codePasswordFormatcode set to 1, which a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa478949.aspx relnofollowaccording to this pagea indicates the passwords are hashed, and not encrypted.p  pNevertheless, I investigated whether I could copy the machineKey from one server to another  but the old server is set to AutoGenerate, so I dont know if this is even possible. And if it is, I dont think itll help as AFAIK the machineKey isnt involved in hashing.p  pOne last thing  the app that handles this is in a subfolder of another app. I dont think that makes any difference but I thought Id mention it. The child app is not set to be an application in IIS, its just a folder.p  pAll in all, Im not sure how to proceed. As far as I can tell the app on both servers is hashing the passwords, not encrypting them, and so it should just move across fine. Id appreciate any advice on what to check .p

The column codedobcode represent for daily customer codedobcode while the codelogcountcode represent the strongvisit timestrong and codeamountcode represent the strongamountstrong they pay for each visit.li liThe third module is the codeprofilecode the user opted to fill in the customer name or not during the codedobcode search from the first module which is a form for the user to enter the date, month and year required field and first name with last name as optional. As the query and insert are made separately, therefore the main data extract the data first and the end of the script will be the insert where the data extracted from main table codedobcode, coderowonecode, coderowtwocode, coderowthreecode are enter into the profile table and log table only codedobcode. The codelogcountcode and codeamountcode are set so it will return the value to the database each time of insert.li liBecause of the first and last name is an optinal value, therefore Ill replace an empty of first and last name to codeGuestcode Guest for recording purposes.li liI need a search bar where the user can directly search the codeprofilecode table for the first and last name and list out all the data of codefirstnamecode, codelastnamecode, codedobcode, coderowonecode, coderowtwocode, coderowthreecode that match the search criteria. This is use for regular customer only, to ease the search by recording their profile instead of keep asking for their codedobcode everytime they visit and search by dob. Thats why Ill use update the existing record instead of keep on insert the same data if codedobcode codefirstnamecode and codelastnamecode is match to avoid profile search showing duplicate data.li ol  hr   pLive case scenario.p  pstrongFor the month of Januarystrong There are total of 20 customers visit.p  ul li4 customers visit are recorded and as the same person John Doe  DOB 19481219.li li3 customers visit are recorded and strongit is different person as previous 4 visitstrong John Doe  DOB 20000731li li5 customers visit are recorded as the same person Vin Diesel  DOB 19590322li li5 customers visit are recorded as the same person Teresa John  DOB 19880518li li1 customers visit are recorded Guest Guest  DOB 19771117li li1 customers visit are recorded Guest Guest  DOB 19620928li li1 customers visit are recorded Guest Guest  DOB 19771117li ul  pGuest Guest are not allowed to combine the visitp  pThe report outcome which join the table of codelogcodeand codeprofilecodep  precodeCustomer Name  Date of Birth  Visit Count  Amount    John Doe     19481219          4        40    John Doe     20000731          3        30   Vin Diesel    19590322          5        50  Teresa John    19880518          5        50  Guest Guest    19771117          1        10  Guest Guest    19620928          1        10  Guest Guest    19771117          1        10 codepre  pstrongTotal Customer Visitstrong 20p  pstrongTotal Earnstrong 200p  pSo I need the codelogcode to record the data by every form submission but codeprofilecode I need to insert if the criteria of codefirstnamecode, codelastnamecode, codedobcode didnt match or if match, then it will update the record.

Negative 608 pAfter banging my head against the wall for awhile trying to figure out how to set up an OC4J server adapter in Eclipse, I finally realized that Eclipse Kepler has retired all  support for the Oracle generic OC4J server adapter.  Is there anyway to manually install the server adapter for use with Eclipse Kepler  Unfortunately, I am limited in my options, and am required to use the OC4J Oracle Containers.  p  pIf I cant directly work with the server in Eclipse Kepler, is there an easy way to deploy the application for testing purposes  I know you can export it to an EAR file and deploy it manually, but would love to find a quicker way for me to easily test the application when making changes.p  pThanks for your helpp  pLaurap

It also defines areas on the screen where the dragged views can   be dropped. Feedback is provided to the user as the objects are dragged over   these drop zones.      p   Like the DragActivity in the previous version of the DragView example   application, the code here is derived from the Android Launcher code.      p   The original Launcher code required a long click press to initiate a   dragdrop sequence.

Negative 608 pI am about to ask a more general conceptual question as apposed to a coding issue. I have recently started using the codeigniter framework and am trying to learn the principles of MVC  so please be patient. I roughly accept this as a really simplistic way of looking at MVC.p  ul liModels  Core logic of the system that passes data from DB to the controllerli liController  Glue that holds the system together and allows data from the view to be passed to the model and vice versa li liView  The view that a user should see within the browser  some form data will be firstly passed to the controller.li ul  pBut I was wondering more about the ability of the model. For example, can data from the database be pulled from the model and stored For example, could the model hold an array of names say that I have queried back from the database Could I then display these to the user 1 by 1 using a button to increment a pointer to point to the next name in the array for example. I apologize if this is a stupid question just trying to figure out how data from the db is handled within the model. p

My idea was that I wanted different layouts for smaller or equal to 320dp, smaller or equal to 480dp, and smaller or equal to 720dp screens. I have this 3 folders in eclipse layout320dp, layoutw480dp and layoutw720dp. The problem is that when I previsualize the layouts with differnt screen configurations I see android not using the expected layout. Some examplesp  ol liNexus One with 480x800 should take layout in w480 but it takes the one in w320li liNexus S with same resolution does same thingli liNexus 7 with 800x1280 should take layout in w720 but it takes the one in w480li ol  pCould anybody guess what is happeningp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 608 pIm trying to create a simple platformer. I have triggers set around where if the player collides, ConstantForce is enabled on the player, and the player is pushed in a chosen direction depending on the trigger. This works relatively well with pushing the player left and right, but where Im having an issue is when the player is pushed up on the Y axis. The player hovers for a bit but each time he drops, he begins to go lower and lower eventually exiting the trigger. I want him to maintain a certain height in air unless he Exits the trigger.

Are there now 150 objects in memory, or are the 50 that get put into filtered just references to the originalsp  pBecause the other way to do it it would seem would be simply to use filtered to store the indices that the objects appear at in raw and retrieve the actual objects on the fly from raw in Activity D and then, when making bigObj to make new mini objects that contain just the information that Activity E needs  from the above example the name and age values, plus the objects position in raw, which can then be used to retrieve the object in Activity F.p  pBut then if the objects are just stored by reference in filtered and bigObj, making a whole set of mini objects would actually be counter productive, and end up chewing into memory rather than saving it.p  pThanks for any thoughts. I suspect that this question could have been asked alot more simply, but I dont know enough to know whats relevant and whats not...  p

Negative 608 pI have been experimenting with a lightweight solution for handling my business logic. It consists of a vanilla ADO.NET connection that is extended with a hrefhttpscode.google.compdapperdotnet relnofollowDappera, and monitored by a hrefhttpgetglimpse.comHelpSQLTab relnofollowGlimpse.ADOa.

I assume the following is happening behind the scenes.p  pThe call to codesqlClientProviderFactory.CreateConnectioncode returns an instance of codeSystem.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectioncode passed as a codeSystem.Data.Common.DbConnectioncode. At this point codeGlimpse.ADO.AlternateType.GlimpseDbProviderFactorycode kicks in and wraps this connection in an instance of codeGlimpse.Ado.AlternateType.GlimpseDbConnectioncode, which is also passed as a codeSystem.Data.Common.DbConnectioncode. Finally, this connection is indirectly extended by the Dapper library with its query methods, among them the codeQueryAsyncltgtcode method used to fetch the cats and dogs.p  pThe questionsp  ol liIs the above assumption correctli liIf I use Dappers async methods with this connection  or create a codeSystem.Data.Common.DbCommandcode with this connections codeCreateCommandcode method, and use its async methods  will those calls internally always end up using the vanilla async implementations of these methods as Microsoft has written them for codeSystem.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectioncode and codeSystem.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommandcode And not some other implementations of these methods that are actually blockingli liHow much perf do I lose with this setup compared to just returning a new codeSystem.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnectioncode directly So, without the Glimpse.ADO wrapperli liAny suggestions on improving this setupli ol

If iI try this with parfor, lets assume that matlabpool invoke 4 workers cores it give me error right on first step function because multiple workers try to execute same function and therefore it cause collision. Step is Matlab routine to access Universal Software Radio Peripheral USRP. But its little complicated when one core already execute that command with argument of some USRP, that USRP is busy and other call of this command causes error. Unfortunatelly there is no scheduling for parallel loops to assign individual step commands to each core. My question is, if is there any question how to parallelize at least three steps commands with prevent cores collision If only these three steps commands, the rest can be done serial way, it doesnt matter. It could be done in worst case by invoking three matlab instances where every instance controls one USRP and before step command could be some external routine like x bit counter in C for instance to synchronize this tasks.p  pIve already tried to use this semaphore routine to create barrier for every core to stop and wait before step commands. a hrefhttpbisqwit.iki.fistoryhowtoopenmpSections relnofollowhttpwww.mathworks.commatlabcentralfileexchange45504semaphoreposixandwindowsa This example is shown herep  precodefunction init     1 exitThreads  false  used to exit func1, func2, func3 threads. 2cntMutexKey  5  mutex for doneCnt. 3doneCnt  0  func13 increment this when they finish. 4barrierCnt  0 global 5barrierKey  7 global 6paralellTasksDoneKey  8 global, semaphore to tell main loop when func13 are   done. 7semaphorecreate, cntMutexKey, 1 8semaphorecreate, barrierKey, 4 Has count of 3 for each of the three functions to execute in parallel.

You have a certain amount of coins, and it asks you to choose a snack. In this shortened program you always have 170 coins and you can only choose KitKat.

But if choice1 is bigger, it should say You cannot afford KitKat. p  pThe problem is, when I test it, it always thinks that choice1 is greater than money and tells me that I cannot afford KitKat. p  pI think maybe when I am inputting KitKat it doesnt recognise it as a variable and compares the word KitKat to the variable money, instead of comparing the variable KitKat to the variable money But Im not sure.

Negative 608 pI need to create a speed bump that issues a warning whenever a user clicks on a link that would direct them to a different website not on the domain. Is there any way to create a custom Orchard workflow activity that will activate whenever a link on the website is clicked Im having a problem getting C to fire an event whenever a link or anchor tag on the page gets clicked I cant just add an onServerClick event to every anchor tag or add an event handler to anchor tags with specific IDs because I need it to fire on all anchor tags many of which are dynamically assigned an id when created. p  pAnother option I was toying with would be to create a custom workflow task that will search any content item for links and then add a speedbump to any link that is determined to lead to an external url. Is it possible to use C to search the contents of any content item upon creationpublish for anchor tags and then alter the tag somehow to include a speedbumpp  pAs a side note I also need to be able to whitelist urls so a third party cant use the speedbump to direct the user to a malicious website.p  pIve been stumped on this for quite some time any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 608 pI apologize that I cannot post actual code or a live working example. This problem requires an codeiframecode so I cant just slap a fiddle together and the server this is deployed on is inaccessible from the net. Hopefully these snippets I will post are adequate for reproduction.p  pI have a page that needs to display another page in an codeiframecode I have no control over this and the codeiframecode should be sized according to the height of its content page which changes as the user interacts with it in various ways the resizing is always due to hidingshowing elements, however, if that makes any difference.p  pThis resize behavior works fine in all browsers with the exception of when the codeiframecode wrapper is hidden initially. In this case the codeiframecode is being sized to the size of what the target page emwould beem if the codeiframecode page elements were all visible in Chrome so gigantic..., or invisible 0 height in FF.p  pThere are no JS errors in console and both pages have no problem accessing each other in other ways codedocument.domaincode is set.

Negative 608 pI am trying to write a Bluetooth LE app that accesses a Zephyr HxM Smart heart monitor.  This monitor has several Bluetooth services, but I am interested in the Battery Service, Heart Rate Service, and a Custom Service that has Activity and Peak Acceleration.  There is one characteristic for each, Battery Level, BAT, Heart Rate Measurement HR, and Custom Measurement CUS.  The HxM updates about once per sec.p  pI am doing this with a Galaxy S4 with Android 4.4.p  pIt is not working as expected from the documentation.p  pMy initial approach was to dop  precodeRead BAT Set notification for HR  Set notification for CUS. codepre  pThen wait for the callbacks.  Setting notification means calling p  precodeBluetoothGatt.setCharacteristicNotificationCharacteristic char , boolean enabled codepre  pOne could also do notification for BAT, however, the spec does not require this to be supported. The HxM, however, does support it.p  pThis didnt work.  I got BAT and notifications for HR, but not CUS.  If I eliminated the second step, I got notifications for CUS.  I couldnt get both.  This indicates I am reading the characteristics correctly, so that is [probably] not the problem.p  pI found some indications there were problems with the Bluetooth stack for Android being synchronous, but strongno hard documentationstrong.  I then tried the followingp  precodeRead BAT. Wait for the BAT reading, then set notification for HR, Get HR, then disable notification for HR, and start notification for CUS. Get CUS, then disable notification for CUS, and start notification for HR. And continue to loop. codepre  pI got BAT and that is all.p  pBy trial and error, I discovered the following worksp  precodeRead BAT. Wait for the BAT reading, then set notification for HR, Get HR, then start notification for CUS. Get CUS, then start notification for HR. And continue to loop. codepre  pSame as above but without disabling notifications.  Typically, I get a HR reading, then the CUS one within 200 ms.  One can assume they are from the same update.  There are no timestamps in the data, which have to be kept short to be LE.  In reality the logic is more complicated, as timers are necessary in case expected readings dont come in.  This logic is FAR more complicated and more prone to error than my first try, which is what the documentation seems to say is what is appropriate.p  pI have contacted Zephyr, and they say the HxM Smart has been extensively tested on Windows, and will do simultaneous notifications as it should.  There are also indications it works as it should on iOS.p  pThere is a further problem that I do not understand.  In order to get notifications, you have to enable the Characteristics locally for notification with something likep  precodeBluetoothGattDescriptor descriptor  characteristic         .getDescriptorUUIDCLIENTCHARACTERISTICCONFIG resSet  descriptor.setValueBluetoothGattDescriptor.ENABLENOTIFICATIONVALUE resWrite  mBluetoothGatt.writeDescriptordescriptor codepre  pThis is a per characteristic setting, and should only need to be done once, when the characteristic is first received.  Instead, I find I have to do it every time I set the notifications.  It is possible this just causes a sufficient time delay for things to work.  I dont know.  This trial and error is taking a lot of my time.  It would be nice to have a definitive statement of how it works.p  pI should note that for all calls that return a result, the result is true success.p  pI apologize for the long statement.  My question isp  pI find no documentation that I have to do the things described.  All indications are that you set up notifications and wait for the callbacks.  strongIs there documentation, or is this a bug, or just a bad implementationstrong  Or is it my error  I would especially like to know where is the documentation for what I have had to do.p  pSecond, there is a further complication.  I have tried to debug into the routines to see what the code is actually doing.  When I get to BluetoothGatt.class, the source lines dont match what the debug stack says.  I thus assume that the S4 is not using standard Android.  I dont know where to go from there.  It has been frustrating, and while I have something that appears to work, it is kludgy and almost certainly less robust.p  pThanks for any help.p

Negative 608 pI have a data set with two classes and was trying to get an optimal classifier using Weka. The best classifier I could obtain was about 79 accuracy. Then I tried adding attributes to my data by classifying it and saving the probability distribution generated by this classification in the data itself.  When I reran the training process on the modified data I got over 93 accuracy I sure this is wrong but I cant exactly figure out why. These are the exact steps I went throughp  ol liOpen the data in Weka.li liClick on add Filter and select codeAddClassificationcode from codeSupervisedgtattributecode.li liSelect a classifier. I select codeJ48code with default settings.li liSet Output Classification to false and set codeOutput Distributioncode to true.li liRun the filter and restore the class to be your original nominal class. Note the additional attributes added to the end of the attribute list. They will have the names codedistributionyourFirstClassNamecode and codedistributionyourSecondClassNamecode.li liGo the Classify tab and select a classifier again I selected codeJ48code. li liRun it. In this step I noticed much more accuracy than before.li ol  pIs this a valid way of creating classifiers Didnt I cheat by adding classification information within the original data If it is valid, how would one proceed to create a classifier that can predict unlabeled data How can it add the additional attribute the distribution  p  pI did try reproducing the same effect using a codeFilteredClassifiercode but it didnt work.

Negative 608 pI am currently trying to write a script to determine the minimum number of jumps you can make in an array to get back to the initial starting number.  The starting number is always the biggest number in the array.p  pAs an example if the array was code[2, 3, 5, 6, 1]code then the starting number would be 6 because it is the biggest.  You can then jump 6 positions either left or right you can choose and where you end up is your next number.  Lets say we went right, we would end up at code1code because we would loop back to the beginning of the array.  You could then go code1code left and end up back at the code6code again.  Therefore the minimum number of jumps is strong2strong.p  pI wrote the below functions to take the input array and determine the minimum number of jumps, however, the recursion in the codesearchcode function is not working as I would hope  expect.p  pEach search function call calls itself 2 times once for left, and once for right, however the constantly incrementing codecountcode variable gets confused.  Once one line of recursion ends when codecountgtarr.lengthcode I would expect it to go back to the previous step and do the right line of recursion.

Negative 608 pI wrote a method to return a string representation of all the static variables in a package. It recursively scans those object for more variables and so on. The problem is some swing objects contain references to their parents and that makes a codeStackOverflowErrorcode.

Negative 608 pI am working on an app in which you can select numerous elements in a map by dragging a rectangle or polygon selection around them. After that the user can make some additional settings, presses a send button and gets to a result page. I want to send the request with GET so that the user can for example save the link.p  pMy problem is that the number of elements that are selected can be very large around 1000 so if I base64encode an array with all element IDs the URL becomes easily too large. Its not an option to send just the polygon or rectangle coordinates because the user is allowed to deselect single buoys manually.p  pSo my question is how can I efficiently compress an array of integers to a short stringp

In our load testing we have found the amount we log vs the size of the queue, and the speed at which the logger drains the queue, this limitation has no effect  there is always space in the queue.li ul  pA final point, the use of codevolatilecode is necessary to prevent the variable which each thread only reads from being optimised out.p  pstrongMy questionsstrongp  ul liIs this logic correctli liIs the queue thread safeli liIs codevolatilecode sufficientli liIs codevolatilecode necessaryli ul  pstrongMy queuestrongp  precodeclass LogBuffer  public     bool isempty const  return head  tail      bool isfull  const  return uint16ttail  1  head      LogLineamp head        return logbuffer[head]      LogLineamp tail        return logbuffer[tail]      void advancehead    head      void advancehail    tail  private     volatile uint16t tail  0      write position     LogLine logbuffer[0xffff  1]  relies on the uint16t overflowing     volatile uint16t head  0      read position  codepre

However, I cant sort by description or partnumber because they, alphanumerically, dont line up by class. But he descripotion field does say at some point in it, what it isie. Nut, bolt, washer etc..br As said, I have a table of classes, and I am looking for a formula that would look in the description field for all the values in the table,and then return that value, or one associated with it like vlookup does with cell values.br So that, if it found nut in the description, it would return nut, or if it found bolt it would return bolt.  p  pI hope that this question makes sense. Let me also say that I found a way manually do this using the search function, along with others, but the formula was very long and each value in my table had to be specially called out. However, I will include the formula I used to make clear what I was trying to do.br See below.  p  precodeIFISNUMBERSEARCHG2,C3,G2,IFISNUMBERSEARCHG3,C3,G3,IFISNUMBERSEARCHG4,C3,G4,IFISNUMBERSEARCHG5,C3,G5,...IFISNUMBERSEARCHG13,C3,G13,MISC codepre  pYou see that with each item you add to your table, you have to add another codeifcode loop. I am hoping there is a better way. I would call it vsearch  p

Negative 608 pI have a horizontal Listview. It works fine. My ArrayList eList will show a ListView going across the screen. Thats great.

Negative 608 pI am running a NetLogo model in BehaviorSpace each time varying number of runs. I have turtlebreed pigs, and they accumulate a table with patchtypes as keys and number of visits to each patchtype as values. p  pIn the end I calculate a list of mean number of visits from all pigs. The list has the same length as long as the original table has the same number of keys number of patchtypes. I would like to export this mean number of visits to each patchtype with BehaviorSpace. p  pPerhaps I could write a separate csv file tried  creates many files, so lots of work later on putting them together. But I would rather have everything in the same file output after a run. p  pI could make a global variable for each patchtype but this seems crude and wrong. Especially if I upload a different patch configuration.p  pI tried just exporting the list, but then in Excel I see it with brackets e.g. [49 0 31.5 76 7 0]. p  pstrongSo my question Q1strong is there a proper way to export a list of values so that in BehaviorSpace table output csv there is a column for each value p  pstrongQ2strong Or perhaps there is an example of how to output a single csv that looks exactly as I want it from BehaviorSpacep  pPS In my case the patch types are costs. And I might change those in the future and rerun everything. Ideally I would like to have as output a graph of costs vs frequency of visits.p  pThanksp

Negative 608 pI could use a little guidance and figure I should ask after searching and not clearly being able to find an answer. I have a nodeangular app scaffolded out with a yeoman generator  a hrefhttpsgithub.comDaftMonkgeneratorangularfullstack relnofollowhttpsgithub.comDaftMonkgeneratorangularfullstacka .p  pWhat I am trying to do is use the node server to set up an external api call, specifically to here  a hrefhttpwww.seismi.orgapi relnofollowhttpwww.seismi.orgapia. I would love to be able to set it where I can customize the url for each get based upon filters in angular on the front end, where I am unclear is the general structure of setting this up ideally from scratch and where I would route and set everything within the MEAN stack. I know this might be asking a somewhat broad question, I am looking for a good way to both learn and understand how this works. I would be very much appreciative of any help. p  pSo My question at its most basic level is how do I scaffold out a custom api call to an external server from start to finish within Node. Thanks very much for taking the time to read.p  pEdit I am just looking to call to an external API  so I would like to figure that out   I can find guides on setting up the call itself on the node server, but to be honest I dont even know what file it would go in and all that. Would very much appreciate any help. Thanksp

Negative 608 pI want to establish an UDP communication between two peers, say Alice and Bob. Alice is behind a port restricted cone NAT so that the same internal port gets mapped to the same external port even if the destination is changed, while Bob is behind a symmetric NAT which means that the external port will change every time a new destination is chosen regardless of the internal port, thus making the external port unpredictable. I have a server in between and I want to make an UDP hole punch.p  pI implemented the following strategyp  ul liBob opens a large number of ports and from all of them sends a packet to Alices external port he gets to know if through the server.li liAlice sends packets to Bobs NAT at random ports until the connection is established.li ul  pHaving two NATs of those types at hand, I did some experiments. Bob opens 32 ports, and Alice sends 64 packets every 0.1 seconds. The connection is usually established within 1 or 2 seconds, which is more than suitable for my needs.p  pHowever, I was wondering if I could get in trouble with some strict NAT routers or firewalls. On example, could it happen that a router wont allow an internal peer to open 32 ports Or and this sounds somehow more likely could it happen that a router that sees a lot of packets incoming on random ports that get dropped will blacklist the ip and drop all its packets for some time I read that sometimes this could happen in case of a DoS attack but my packet rate is something like 4 to 6 orders of magnitude lighter than a DoS attack.p  pI am asking about reasonable network configuration I am pretty sure that in principle it is possible to setup a firewall to behave in that way. I will be targeting mainly users that lie behind standard home connections, so my main target is common internet providers that use NATs.p

Negative 608 pI am building my first backbone app with bootstrap. It is a simple Contact Manager which so far only reads the contacts from an array and displays the contacts information. Initially the contact card is minimized but upon clicking inside the contact card it expands using jquery animate.

I did it here for examplep  precodePersonenDatenDummy pers  new PersonenDatenDummy FirstFloor.ModernUI.Presentation.Link link  new FirstFloor.ModernUI.Presentation.Link link.DisplayName  pers.getVorname     pers.getNachname Person person  new Personpers.getVorname, pers.getNachname link.Source  new UriPagesPerson.xaml,UriKind.Relative this.ModernTabLinks.Links.Addlink codepre  pIn this case the Person person is an object which contains all the Data for now just the name. person.xaml is there to show the data contained in person. Now this works fine when there is just one person. But by adding another Person all person show the same data.p  pMy Idea was to get an uri from Person person, to add it to the link.Source.p  pI found another thread with a similar question but OP figured out what to do and was never seen again. Just say if you guys need more information. Its my first time posting here after many many useful answers I got from here, I hope Im doing it right.p  pThanks in advance.p

It just seems that the Context is not being injected at all. I checked and its the secContext variable itself, not just the return from getUserPrincipal that is null. There are no warning or exceptions in the Glassfish log besides my NullPointer which results in a 500 error returned to the web client.p

In this function there is a while loop. There, first is sent a message to UI thread with the current time in the to be shown in the codeltTEXTAREAgtcode. Next, the codesetTimeoutcode is called to pause in the time setted by codestepTimecode codeltSELECTgtcode element. Also, when the loop starts, the emStartem button must be disabled and the emStopem one enabled. When the emStopem is clicked, it changes the coderunningcode flag in the Worker to false and stops the loop. Also, the emStartem button must be enabled and the emStopem one disabled. Always when I click in the buttons, the console shows the message which is sent to worker and next the message that is received by the UI Thread from Worker. When I change the codestepTimecode codeltSELECTgtcode value, the worker pause time changes. The emCleanem button simply cleans the codeltTEXTAREAgtcode. p  pWhat I really got When I click emStartem, the codeltTEXTAREAgtcode is filled with current time messages and the controls simply dont respond. Actually all the browser instances I tested in Firefox freeze and after some time crash. Apparently, the codesetTimeoutcode is not working in the Worker, althought it works in UI for example, in console I type codesetTimeoutfunction console.debugPAUSE, idstepTime.valuecode. p  pA workaround I tried was replace codesetTimeoutcode calling by codepausecode function. I got this The page and the browser is not freezed. The codeltTEXTAREAgtcode shows the time messages, with the interval initially setted in the codeltSELECTgtcode. The emCleanem button works as expected. However, when the loop starts, it shows the console message in worker codeconsole.debug[WORKER] STARTING. running    runningcode, but not the worker response codepostMessagemsg STARTEDcode. Neither the emStartem is disabled not the emstopem is enabled. Besides, if I change the codeltSELECTgtcode value, it does not change the interval. If I really want change the interval, I need reload the page and set another value.p  pLooking into the code it is obvious why the response is not being called when I start the loop, because the coderuncode function is a inifinite loop and therefore response command never is reached. p  pTherefore, I have two questions p  ol liHow to change the code to make it really assyncronous and responsive.  li liWhy codesetTimeoutcode is not working if it should work according the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebAPIWebWorkersAPIbasicusageImportingscriptsandlibraries relnofollowWeb Worker definitiona.li ol  pThanks, p  pRafael Afonsop

Negative 608 pIm trying to create a UI element on iOS that expands or contracts to fit dynamic, often multiline text. I need to put an image underneath the text that looks a lot like a message bubble. However, I only need one of these in my entire UI, so a table view seems overkill  unless reasonably necessary.p  pIve tried to use a strongUILabelstrong for this purpose, but it seems to have very limited support for background images. I can only get it to tile the image, which is not what I want.p  pIt seems that a strongUIButtonstrong is the simplest construct that should reasonably do what Im asking, but I cannot get it to work.

Simply yes, it should work this way, you must have some error there or no, you must save Phone first to get its ID would be sufficient  Thanksp
Negative 608 pI am trying to achieve that certain objects within my application can only be constructed as sharedptrs by a call to a static method called create. p  pOf course I could do this by directly adding the static create method to all the respective class. However, this would mean I have to repeat very similar code in almost all my classes. A macro would work, but I do not find this very elegant.p  pI came up with an alternative way of doing this by deriving all classes from a templated BaseObject class that implements the create method and returns the pointer. This almost works, except that stdmakeshared cannot access the constructor of its child class when it is protected. p  pThe nonsolution would be to make the child class constructor public see 1 in the example below. But now Foo can be normally constructed again and this would defeat the entire point. An alternative solution would be to friend BaseObject in the child class and make use of sharedptr directly see 2 in the example. p  pBoth solutions put extra burden on the implementer of the child class. Since they have to either find an alternative way of making the constructor nonpublic or put a friend declaration. The 2 solution has the additional problem of not being able to use the more efficient makeshared.p  pMy question is there a better way of doing thisp  precodetemplateltclass Tgt class BaseObject  public     typedef stdsharedptrltTgt SharedPtr      templateltclass...

Negative 608 pIm trying to do a bunch of rolling sums over matrices in MATLAB. In order to avoid loops Ive used a hrefhttpwww.mathworks.comhelpmatlabrefrepmat.html relnofollowcoderepmatcodea to layer my 2D matrices into a 3D structure. However, now the fast convolution function a hrefhttpwww.mathworks.comhelpmatlabrefconv2.html relnofollowcodeconv2codea can no longer be used for the accumulator. However, the Ndimensional convolution function a hrefhttpwww.mathworks.comhelpmatlabrefconvn.html relnofollowcodeconvncodea is not what Im looking for either as it literally convolves all 3 dimensions. I want something that will do a 2D convolution on each slice and return a 3D matrix.p  pTiling the matrices in 2D instead of layering them in 3D wont work because it will corrupt the convolution edge cases.

Do I need to activate it somehow or am I approaching it from a totally wrong anglep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7mqkb.png altenter image description herep

Negative 608 pSince last 3 hours i am trying to sort out this problem but couldnt, i tried using solutions posted on other such stackoverflow questions, but didnt work.p  pSo heres what my problem isp  pI have a website which has two phases, one is for visitors other is for admins. Now earlier i had both admin and nonadmin php files within root directory and js and css files in their respective folders namely css and js within root directory of website. p  pBut to make everything sorted, i pulled all the admin panel related php files to a folder named adpanel within root directory and their css and js stored in their respective folders inside folder adpanel. p  pAnd from here onwards the chaos began, the css failed to show up, even in firebug it showed nothing under its css tab, it was empty. I thought the problem might have been because of the way i entered the path in href, but even after trying other ways, it failed to load. p  pBut everything works perfect in chrome. I tried to clear whole data of firefox, but that didnt help either.p  pPlease help me outp  pI think the problem is browser related, as explained earlier css loads perfectly in other browser. And now i tried calling the css file from older css folderthe one inside root directory and it worked. But ive cleared up whole firefox, should i try reinstalling firefoxp  pUpdate Have tried reinstalling firefox too. Nothing changes.p  pstrongFinal Updatestrong Guys it was the firefox causing problem. As i said earlier i uninstalled firefoxbut not completely and then again i installed but the problem remained, then after searching a while i first uninstalled firefox then went into APPDATA folder and deleted Mozilla Firefox folder.p  pThen i reinstalled firefox and alas it started working as expected and css began to show its effect on pages.p  pNow, Thank You each and everyoneofcourse including stackoverflow who took their precious time for sorting out my problem. And my apologies if anyhow i fell short in providing proper information. Ill improve myself in better explaining my queries. Thank You once again. Good Day p

Negative 608 pIve been using the Google Blogger API v2 for a long time, using GDATA to authenticate and post new posts. However, this is not supported now anymore and they are requiring an OAuth authentication. Unfortunately I cannot find any .Net documentation I fully understand. I followed them as best as I could, and I dont see any errors, so I do not know what else to try, please help me.p  pMy first approach was to go like this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions30469058googlegdataclientgdatarequestexceptionauthenticationsuddenlyfailsinoldGoogle.GData.Client.GDataRequestException  Authentication suddenly fails in old codea Here an example for Google Spread Sheets is given. However, I do not know with what to replace the line var service  new SpreadsheetsServicenull, since I do not know if there is a Blogger service.p  pIn the second approach I first got an OAuth2 token like before and then followed the description from a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.combloggerdocs3.0usinghlde relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.combloggerdocs3.0usinghldea about publishing posts. So I created a WebRequest as followsp  precodevar http  HttpWebRequestWebRequest.Createnew UribaseAddress         http.Accept  applicationjson         http.ContentType  applicationjson         http.Method  POST         http.Headers.AddAuthorization, Bearer   token           var vm  new  kind  bloggerpost, blog  new  id  id , title  Testtitle, content  testcontent          var dataString  JsonConvert.SerializeObjectvm         string parsedContent  dataString         ASCIIEncoding encoding  new ASCIIEncoding         Byte[] bytes  encoding.GetBytesparsedContent          Stream newStream  http.GetRequestStream         newStream.Writebytes, 0, bytes.Length         newStream.Close          var response  http.GetResponse          var stream  response.GetResponseStream         var sr  new StreamReaderstream         var content  sr.ReadToEnd codepre  pBut here, I got 403 not allowed.

For example www.application.comcustomer1pagespage.jsf or www.application.comcustomer2pagespage.jsfp  pBut i dont know how to implement that.

I am finding that I am fighting with maintaining the codethiscode context to point to my module after using code.eachcode.p  pI know that the jQuery code.eachcode method creates a closure and hence a new context, however I do want to continue to have codethiscode referring to the module.

If two boxes have the same length text they line up, otherwise the longer one is higher, and the difference in height is proportional to the difference in length.p  pAlso, any child on there own seems to float off to the left rather than sitting centrally as they should. strongEDIT THIS PART HAS BEEN ANSWEREDstrongp  pExamples here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net7g7fz2tL5 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net7g7fz2tL5ap  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidetrue div classsnippetcode snippetcurrentlyhidden pre classsnippetcodecss langcss prettyprintoverridecode    margin 0   padding 0   .tree ul    paddingtop 20px   position relative   webkittransition all 0.5s   moztransition all 0.5s   transition all 0.5s   .tree li    float left   textalign center   liststyletype none   position relative   padding 20px 5px 0 5px   webkittransition all 0.5s   moztransition all 0.5s   transition all 0.5s  We will use before and after to draw the connectors  .tree libefore, .tree liafter    content    position absolute   top 0   right 50   bordertop 1px solid ccc   width 50   height 65px   zindex 1   .tree liafter    right auto   left 50   borderleft 1px solid ccc  We need to remove leftright connectors from elements without  any siblings  .tree lionlychildafter, .tree lionlychildbefore    display none  Remove space from the top of single children  .tree lionlychild    paddingtop 0  Remove left connector from first child and  right connector from last child  .tree lifirstchildbefore, .tree lilastchildafter    border 0 none  Adding back the vertical connector to the last nodes  .tree lilastchildbefore    borderright 1px solid ccc   borderradius 0 5px 0 0   webkittransform translateX1px   moztransform translateX1px   transform translateX1px   webkitborderradius 0 5px 0 0   mozborderradius 0 5px 0 0   borderradius 0 5px 0 0   .tree lifirstchildafter    borderradius 5px 0 0 0   webkitborderradius 5px 0 0 0   mozborderradius 5px 0 0 0  Time to add downward connectors from parents  .tree ul ulbefore    content    position absolute   top 60px   left 50   borderleft 1px solid ccc   width 0   height 80px   zindex 1   .tree li a    border 1px solid ccc   padding 5px 10px   textdecoration none   color 666   fontfamily arial, verdana, tahoma   fontsize 11px   display inlineblock   background white   webkitborderradius 5px   mozborderradius 5px   borderradius 5px   webkittransition all 0.5s   moztransition all 0.5s   transition all 0.5s   .tree li aa    marginleft 20px   position relative   .tree li aabefore    content    position absolute   bordertop 1px solid ccc   top 50   left 26px   width 25px  Time for some hover effects We will apply the hover effect the the lineage of the element also  .tree li ahover, .tree li ahoverul li a    background c8e4f8   color 000   border 1px solid 94a0b4  Connector styles on hover  .tree li ahoverul liafter, .tree li ahoverul libefore, .tree li ahoverulbefore, .tree li ahoverul ulbefore    bordercolor 94a0b4   .tree li a    height 60px   width 60px   .tree gt ul gt li gt ulbefore    top 40px  .tree ul li.greatgrandchild      float none  codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltdiv classtreegt   ltulgt     ltligt       lta hrefgtRootltagt       ltulgt         ltligt           lta hrefgtChild with nameltagt           lta hrefgtChild with nameltagt           ltulgt             ltligt               lta hrefgtGrandchild with nameltagt               lta hrefgtGrandchild with longer nameltagt               ltulgt                 ltli classgreatgrandchildgt                   lta hrefgtGreat Grandchildltagt                 ltligt               ltulgt             ltligt             ltligt               lta hrefgtGrandchild with nameltagt               lta hrefgtGrandchild with much longer nameltagt               ltulgt                 ltli classgreatgrandchildgt                   lta hrefgtGreat Grandchildltagt                 ltligt               ltulgt             ltligt           ltulgt         ltligt       ltulgt     ltligt   ltulgt ltdivgtcodepre div div p  pAny ideas what could be causing thishow I can fix itp

Here is what the documentation saysp  blockquote   pNote as of API 19, all repeating alarms are inexact. If your   application needs precise delivery times then it must use onetime   exact alarms, rescheduling each time as described above. Legacy   applications whose targetSdkVersion is earlier than API 19 will   continue to have all of their alarms, including repeating alarms,   treated as exact.p blockquote  pAnd possible solutionsp  blockquote   pNote for timing operations ticks, timeouts, etc  it is easier and much more efficient to use Handlerp      pIf your application wants to allow the delivery times to drift in order to guarantee that at least a certain time interval always elapses between alarms, then the approach to take is to use onetime alarms, scheduling the next one yourself when handling each alarm delivery.p blockquote

Negative 608 pI have several Async tasks throughout an app Im designing.  Several times an async task will run very slowly.  Examining the log file shows that the desired background operation isnt actually causing the delay.  The delay is that the background thread is held up by the Garbage Collection davlvikvm.  Im not totally sure why there is so much GC happening in my app, its not particularly memory intensive no videos, just basic lists and a few images, and the MAT tool doesnt show any egregious memory violators.  Regardless, Im looking for a solution to keep my app running quickly to avoid long delays for the user.  p  pI have tried to force the GC to happen earlier to avoid it, but it still runs at these inopportune times.  My new thought is to tell the async task to run on a separate independent thread, so that it is not held up by the status of the GC.  Is this possible  Is there a better wayp  pThanksp
