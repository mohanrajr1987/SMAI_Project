Positive 21 pUse Casep  pIm building a site where users can search records  with SQL. BUT  they should also be able to save their search and be notified when a new submitted record meets the criteria.p  pIts not a car buying site, but for example The user searches for a 1967 Ford Mustang with a 289 V8 engine, within the 90291 ZIP code. Cant find the right one, but they want to be notified if a matching car is submitted 2 weeks later.p  pSo of course, every time a new car is added to the DB, I can retrieve all the user search queries, and run all of them over all the cars in the DB.

Seems that its the first record of the contacts table.p  pOtherwise, I can keep one database and control everything with the userid.

Positive 21 pI have 5 tables that can contain a phone field, but I want to have the option for multiple phone numbers for each table.p  pInstead of creating 5 sub tables, it makes more sense to create one, and link it to the other 5 parent tables. But now I am thinking of how to link that table to the other 5.p  pMy first thought was to filter on 2 subjects. A field that stores the name of the linked table, and a generic foreign key that contains the key from one of the five tables. Im still leaning this way.p  pNext is the idea of putting 5 foreign keys into the table, and allowing them to be null. I dislike both the idea of 4 null fields. Not to mention I have the same issue with another table that would link to 11 other tables in a similar manner.p  pThe third is a linking or junction table, again I believe, with 5 nullable foreign keys, but this doesnt seem to do anything more then option 2 with a little more complexity.p  p4th option, Im using an autoincrement field for the primary key for most of my tables. I could switch to a UUID or GUID for these tables. Im already set up to use UUID as primary for security reasons, but was using autoincrement for most tables for performance.p  pA 5th option is something I ran into where an autoincrement field was combined with a table name to create a new character field. Only during creation of the table, so technically isnt a calculated field. But again dont see the benefit of this beyond the first option.p  pIs one of these the best way to go, or is there another option I either missed, or do not understandp

Negative 21 pMy question is based off of inheriting a great deal of legacy code that I cant do very much about.  Basically, I have a device that will produce a block of data.  A library which will call the device to create that block of data, for some reason I dont entirely understand and cannot change even if I wanted to, writes that block of data to disk.p  pThis write is not instantaneous, but can take up to 90 seconds.  In that time, the user wants to get a partial view of the data thats being produced, so I want to have a consumer thread which reads the data that the other library is writing to disk.p  pBefore I even touch this legacy code, I want to mimic the problem using code I entirely control.  Im using C, ostensibly because it provides a lot of the functionality I want.p  pIn the producer class, I have this code creating a random block of datap  precodeFileStream theFS  new FileStreamthis.ScannerRawFileName,    FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.Read note that I need to be able to read this elsewhere...

This code works.  The current version using FileStream and BinaryWriter appears to be equivalent though slower, because of the copy to using File.Open with the same options and a BinaryFormatter on the ushort[] being written to disk.p  pBut then I add a consumer threadp  precodeFileStream theFS if File.ExiststheFileName      do error handling     return  else       theFS  new FileStreamtheFileName, FileMode.Open,          FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read             very relaxed file opening  BinaryReader theReader  new BinaryReadertheFS  gotta do this copying in order to handle byte array swaps frustrating, but true. byte[] theNewArray  theReader.ReadBytes    intimheight  imwidth  inBase.Progress  2 ushort[] theData  new ushort[inttheNewArray.Length2] Buffer.BlockCopytheNewArray, 0, theData, 0, theNewArray.Length codepre  pNow, its possible that the declaration of theNewArray is broken, and will cause some kind of read overflow.  However, this code never gets that far, because it always always always breaks on trying to open the new FileStream with a System.IO.IOException that states that another process has opened the file.p  pIm setting the FileAccess and FileShare enumerations as stated in the FileStream documentation on MSDN, but it appears that I just cant do what I want to do ie, write in one thread, read in another.  I realize that this application is a bit unorthodox, but when I get the actual device involved, Im going to have to do the same thing, but using MFC.p  pIn any event, What am I forgetting  Is what Im wanting to do possible, since its specified as possible in the documentation  p  pThanks mmrp

I would really like to make use of the OpenID authentication. In case of regular web browser things are pretty straightforward.

The mobile client app could be assembled dynamically on the server with the SSL certificate embedded that is associated with particular logged in OpenID user. After that, j2me client could authenticate to the server without entering any usernamepassword. The data that is going to be stored on the server is not THAT sensitive  considering cases of mobile phone thefts etc.p  pCan anybody come up with a better solutionp

Negative 21 pWhat Im trying to do is rather basic, but I might have my facts mixed up. I have a details page that has a custom class as its Model. The custom class uses 2 custom objects with yet another custom object a property of one of the 2. The details page outputs a fair amount of information, but allows the user to post a comment. When the user clicks the post button, the page gets posted to a Details action that looks something like thisp  precode        [AcceptVerbsHttpVerbs.Post]     public ActionResult DetailsVideoDetailModel vidAndComment  .... codepre  pThe only fields on the form that is posted are CommentText and VideoId. Here is what the VideoDetailModel looks like.p  precodepublic class VideoDetailModel      public VideoDetailModel              Video  new VideoDTO         Comment  new CommentDTO           public VideoDetailModelVideoDTO vid              Video  vid         Comment  new CommentDTO           public VideoDTO Video  get set      public CommentDTO Comment  get set   codepre  pVideoDTO has a few properties, but the ones I need are VideoId. CommentDTOs pertinent properties include CommentText which is posting correctly and a UserDTO object that contains a userId property. Everything other than the CommentText value is not being posted. I also have the following line on the ascx page, but the model value never gets posted to the controller.p  precodeHtml.HiddenModel.Video.VideoId, Model.Video.VideoId        codepre  pIm really not sure what Im missing here. I suppose if I added more form fields for the properties I need, they would get posted, but I only need 1 form entry field for the CommentText. If I could get the same Model objects value that were sent to the page to post with the page, that would help.p  pIll be happy to make any clarifications needed here. Im just at loss as to whats going on.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pOkay, it looks like the solution is rather simple. I think using the RenderPartial in the middle of a form is problematic somehow to how the form gets written in html. I cant really put my finger on why things went bonkers, but if I do my RenderPartials before my form and then begin my form with the text entry field and the hidden VideoId, the default ModelBinder works just fine. I was beginning the form, writing the hidden VideoId, rendering several partial views, create my CommentText field, and then closed the form out. The CommentText field would get bound just fine. The hidden VideoId would not. Maybe I missed a rule somewhere about using RenderPartial.p  pFor completeness, the partial view I was rendering took a Comment object and just wrote out its CommentText data. Several of these objects would exist for a single Video object. All of this data was in a custom type and passed into the View the main view as its Model. This partial view did not have a form and did not have any data entry fields.p

Negative 21 pFor the past few months Ive been working on a Visual C project to take images from cameras and process them. Up until today this has taken about 65 ms to update the data but now it has suddenly increased significantly. What happens is I launch my program and for the first 30 or so iterations it performs as expected, then suddenly the loop time increases from 65 ms to 250 ms.p  pThe odd thing is, after timing each function I found out that the part of the code which is causing the slowdown is fairly basic and has not been modified in over a month. The data which goes into it is unchanged and identical every iteration but the execution time which is initially less than 1 ms suddenly increases to 170 ms while the rest of the code is still performing as expected timewise. p  pBasically, I am calling the same function over and over, for the first 30 calls it performs as it should, after that it slows down for no apparent reason. It might also be worth noting that it is a sudden change in execution time, not a gradual increase.p  pWhat could be causing this The code is leaking some memory 50 kbs but not nearly enough to warrant a sudden 4x slowdown. If anyone has any ideas Id love to hear themp  pEdit Wow, that was fast Heres the code minus some maths which slows down. I know this is a function where the computational time will increase rapidly if you increase the number of lines.

Negative 21 pfew days ago I asked here about implementing USB. Now, If I may, would like to ask few more questions, about thing I dindt quite understood. p  pSo, first, If I am right, Windows has device driver for USB interface, for the physical device that sends and receives communication. But what this driver offers to system user I mean, USB protocol is made so its devices are adressed. So you first adress device than send message to it. p  pBut how sophisticted is the device controller HW and its driver Is it so sophisticated that it is a chip you just send device adress and data, and it writes the outcomming data out and incomming data to some internal register to be read, or thru DMA directly to memory p  pOr, how its drivers SW really work Does its driver has some advanced functions like send data to device Becouse I somewhat internally hope there is a way to directly send some data thru USB, maybe by calling USB drivers itself Is there any good article, tutorial you know about to really explain how all this logic works Thanks.  p

Negative 21 pIs there a way to check whether the user has enabled speech recognition spoken commands in System Preferences Mac OS X.  If the user has it enabled, I would like to support additional speech commands.  Unfortunately there isnt any method in codeNSSpeechRecognizercode to check this and I cant seem to find any Carbon functions to check it either.p  pOne of the problem is that the round Speech Commands window the one with a microphone on it seems to appear intermittently whenever I instantiate codeNSSpeechRecognizercode. Also it often freezes my app for about half a second or so while the object is created probably its starting up the speech recognition service.  p  pIn essence, if the speech recognizer isnt already running and being used, I dont want to start it up.  But if the user actively uses the speech recognizer, I would like to provide additional support for it.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 21 pLets say you have a Makefile with two pseudotargets, all and debug.

While we do use querystrings that eventually resolve to integers, they are first encrypted and then decrypted and converted to int using codeConvert.ToInt32code before we use them.  I know that we should use codeTryParsecode instead, but even if a hacker were to enter an integer value higher than max, they would fail when trying to decrypt before even trying to convert to integer, which is where the integer overflow would occur in my opinion.  That is unless the error happens when the decryption fails  p  pIm pretty confused about this and google searches havent been much help as most pertain to unmanaged languages like c rather than c and asp.net.

Negative 21 pi want to create an application that is able to detect the users position inside buildings but im unsure where to start.

I believe that the position of the user will be tracked via wifi  but i have done some research into this and it seems that the minimum amount of wifi points needs to be 3 in order to triangulate the position. also how accurate will this be. I saw on the app store a few applications that track the position of the user inside supermarkets, how is this done Would appreciate some help on this, any articlestutorials you could share would be of great value ].

Negative 21 pIn my Express app, Id like to perform some redirects when certain params from the route match certain criteria, using a route param precondition. As an example, lets say I want the param codewordcode to be converted to all uppercase, if it isnt already.p  pThe param codewordcode might be present in several different routes, e.g. codewordcode, codefoowordcode, codefoowordbarcode, etc. Fortunately, with route param preconditions, these are all handled by the same code, e.g. code in CoffeeScriptp  precodeapp.param word, req, res, next, word gt   if word isnt word.toUpperCase     newURL   current URL, but replace word with word.toUpperCase      res.redirect newURL, 301 codepre  pMy question regards how to construct codenewURLcode, replacing codewordcode with its uppercase equivalent. I want to be able to use the same function to construct codenewURLcode, regardless of which route is currently being used.p  pI see that there is codereq.routecode, but it is undefined. I guess I can access the currently matched route via codereq.app.routes.routes.get[req.routeindex]code, and then split the codepathcode, and reconstruct it, but that seems overly complicated. Is there a way to simply iterate the codepathcode segments for the current route Thanksp

Negative 21 pI am using Visual Studio 2008 SP1 on Windows XP SP3 to develop some .NET Compact Framework 3.5 SP1 solution for Windows CE 6.p  pI want to use SQL Server Compact 3.5 SP2 in my solution, however I notice something very strange with how Visual Studio treats assembly references.p  pI have installed both SQL Server Compact 3.5 SP2 for Windows emDesktopem SSCERuntimex86ENU.msi and SQL Server Compact 3.5 SP2 for Windows emMobileem SSCEDeviceRuntimeENU.msi. The former puts emtwoem versions of the System.Data.SqlServerCE assembly and one version of the System.Data.SqlServerCe.Entity assembly into Windows XPs GAC, while the latter does not seem to put any assembly into Windows XPs GAC. Here already, it looks strange because GAC reports the versions of the two assemblies to be 3.5.1.0 and 3.5.0.0 for System.Data.SqlServerCE, and 3.5.1.0 for System.Data.SqlServerCE.Entity, whereas in the installation directories of SQL Server Compact 3.5 SP2 CProgram FilesMicrosoft SQL Server Compact Editionv3.5 and CProgram FilesMicrosoft SQL Server Compact Editionv3.5Desktop, Windows Explorer reports both assemblies to be version 3.5.8080.0. Now I know that 3.5.0.0 is supposed to be for emvanillaem SQL Server Compact 3.5 i.e. emno SPem and 3.5.1.0 is supposed to be for emSP1em, not SP2. I did not install either vanilla or SP1, so why are they even therep  pFurthermore, in Visual Studio 2008 SP1, when I try to add the System.Data.SqlServerCE assembly from the CProgram FilesMicrosoft SQL Server Compact Editionv3.5emDevicesem directory, Visual Studio 2008 SP1 reports a version number of 3.5.1.0 in the Properties panel. This version number seems to be retrieved from the GACed assembly, which shouldnt even be for .NET strongCompact Frameworkstrong. The real version number in CProgram FilesMicrosoft SQL Server Compact Editionv3.5emDevicesem is supposed to be 3.5.8080.0, again.p  pI know that it is possible to use private deployment, as described at a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarygg213826.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarygg213826.aspxa, but Im still bothered by the fact that Visual Studio seems to be referencing the wrong platformversion of the assembly altogether when I dont specifically resort to private deployment.p  pMaybe I just dont understand how Visual Studio works in conjunction with GAC.

Negative 21 pstrongMotivestrongbr Im trying to create a small demo application using WebGL.

My problem is that the models dont have any textures or materials. p  pI used the a hrefhttpscenejs.orgdistcurrextrexamplesseymourplaneindex.htmlSeymour Plane Examplea of SceneJS. The model I converted is hardly visible. It is black and doesnt seem to respond to the lighting in the scene. If I load the plane and the model together, I can see the model is loaded, because its arms and legs are sticking out of the plane.p  pNow I followed a couple of tutorials that would let me export the texture as a PNG image. I then modified the texture file name in the JSON model to match the file name, but it doesnt help.p  pSo I hope someone can help me to find a way to export Blender models or other common 3D models to the JSON format used by SceneJS, including the textures.p  pAny other method of loading models in SceneJS will do too, as long as it works.p  pIf one s got a link to free downloads of bodyfigure JSON models, that would help for now, but I rather learn how this works. p  pstrongIm usingstrongp  ul liWindows 7 Home Premium 64bitli liPython 2.7 Windows 32bit bremI chose the 32 bit version, because of seemingly better support for libraries, and more available installers.

Negative 21 pI am performing a longliving HTTPGET request on android, using the Apache http classes. As I want to interrupt this request at any time, I call abort on this HttpGet from another thread from the main thread. The blocking call of HttpClient.execute returns, as an IOException is thrown immediately. All works as I expect it on Android 2.3.p  pWhen I run the same code on Android 2.2 tested on HTC Desire and Emulator, no Exception is thrown. The loadingthread is still blocking. I have got no chance to interrupt it.p  pMy first guess was, that android 2.2 is using an older version of the Apache HTTP Client. So I included the latest version as a library with a different namespace and checked my imports.  same result.p  pAny ideas, why its not working on android 2.2 and probaply earlierp

Negative 21 pI have a Java library that uses a few things from the Android APIs. Id like to use Mockito to write unit tests for this library. p  pIs there a way I can go about this p  pMockito doesnt play nice on the Dalvik VM, see this post a hrefhttpcode.google.compmockitoissuesdetailid57Using Mockito with Android virtual machineap  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pSince this post Ive discovered Robolectric, and Ive had the opportunity to work out of Pivotal Labs and make some small contributions to this library. I would recommend using this over the Android testing frameworkmockito. Also, youre free to use Robolectric AND Mockito, but the shadow objects in Robolectric make Mockito unnecessary for most use cases.p  pThe problem with trying to unit test Android is that the Android library that you build on has every method stubbed out to either throw a stub exception, or return null. If you want to test your app and want any Android behavior you are out of luck, unless you use Robolectric which rewrites the bytecode on the fly when the classes load, and injects a shadow object that simulates the behavior. p  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pIts been a while and things have changed. Many of the Shadow classes in Robolectric have been replaced with the real Android classes. The real Android jars are now used and Robolectric only loads Shadow classes for a much smaller set of things. This is even more of a reason to use Robolectric for your Android testing.p

Negative 21 pI am new to iOS and using storyboards for the first time.  When my app starts it checks back with the a server app I have written to see if the saved credentials are authenticated and I then in my AppDelegate class I then attempt to show the appropriate scene in the apps storyboard  MainMenu if authenticated or a Login Screen if not authenticated.p  pI have tried using instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier on the storyboard and also the performSegueWithIdentifier on the initial NavigationController which is set to be the Initial View Controller to display the appropriate view..p  pHowever with both methods only the blank navigation bar shows and I am unsure where to go from here.p  pIf there was some example code on how others manually manipulate storyboard scenes and viewcontrollers that would be great.  Am I maybe putting the code in the wrong place ie should it go into the first View Controller or should that not matter  No exceptions are raised and I seem to have access to instantiated objects as required.p  pI am thinking I need to understand the operation of the app delegates window more, or maybe should I focus on manually loading the storyboard by removing its reference from the InfoPlist settingsp  pAny thoughts would be greatly appreciated.p
Negative 21 pThis may be a design error instead of a syntax error, so let me know if Im coding in the wrong direction here.p  pIm new to Cocoa TouchObjectiveC and Ive been working through tutorials on Core Data and MapKit. So far the app places an annotation on a mapview for items fetched from Core Data. I made a custom annotation object called MapPin that also holds a URI NSURL pointing to the object in Core Data that it represents.

Negative 21 pI have a Timer in a C app Win7 64. Every 20 min the timer callback gets some data via HTTP. It works well. But if my PC goes to sleep for a few hours, then wakes up, I get an HTTP error saying cant find the server. The server is running at all times, so its not the real issue. I suspect the real reason is that as the timer callback misses its time slot during the sleep period, it becomes overdue and is executed instantly right after the wakeup, without waiting for the PC to reestablish the Internet connection. I can fix the problem by adding a strongThread.Sleep5000strong at the beginning of the callback, but its a bit of a kludge establishing Internet connection might take longer. My questionsp  ol lipAfter a wakeup from sleep mode, does Win indeed need a few seconds to reestablish Internet connection My connection is DSL, always online.pli lipIs there a C system call which would wait until Win establishes the Internet connection or time out if this doesnt happen within, say, 20 secspli ol  pEDIT Just found this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1085045checkwhetherinternetconnectionisavailablewithcsharpCheck Net connection in Ca.

Negative 21 pI am currenty writing my masters thesis about monitoring of distributed systems. For this purpose I have designed a framework that can record monitoring data and analyze this data in a series of filters pipes and filter style. It is based on the a hrefhttpsse.informatik.unikiel.dekieker relnofollowKieker monitoring frameworka.p  pYou can connect the different filters to each other by subscribing to an output port, like sop  precodeDurationFilter durationFilter  new DurationFilter Timeline timeline  new Timeline... durationFilter.getOutputPort.subscribetimeline codepre  pThis mechanism is provided by the Kieker framework which I am using.p  pTo run an analysis the user currently has to connect the filters manually by writing out the code. What I want to do now is write a tool with a GUI that makes it easier to create a configuration set of filters, input files and the connections. Ideally the user could do it like in a UML editor, creating boxes filters and connecting them with lines connections and set the parameters for input input files etc.p  pThese configurations then need to be executed, meaning I need a mapping from the graph to the code to the java code. That was my idea so far. First off do you think this approach is the right one for this taskp  pIn my research I found the framework a hrefhttpwww.randelshofer.choopjhotdraw relnofollowJHotDrawa which has a lot of the features I just mentioned. With JHotDraw I can create the visual elements Figures on a drawing area DrawingEditor including a set of tools to create, edit and connect the elements. This I have done and its pretty straightforward. A bonus is the undoredo functionality of JHotDraw.p  pNow my problem I am not sure how I am supposed to get from the graphical representation in the editor to the java code. What I have is the Vpart of the MVC pattern which the framework supposedly uses. The Figures are the view. But where does the model go and how does it integrate into the framework I am thinking that for every element that is displayed in the DrawingEditor I will have to have a corresponding model that stores the data for the element. A FilterModel would have attributes like input data types which data can it process, output ports and their data types what kind of data does it create and the type of the filter corresponds to the Java class. Those are necessary to check if one filter can connect to another and to execute the whole thing in the end.p  pNot sure if I am making myself clear. If anything is unclear please ask.p

Negative 21 pI am new to inapp purchases. I have successfully implemented and tested code to let user make a purchase within our app.p  pThe question I have is once the user hits purchase my app button, do I set a NSUserDefaults variable to TRUE in my app so that I can unlock all the features that were locked. Meaning I check if that  NSUserDefaults is TRUE then show them more stuff.p  pIs this the best approach to take What I have noticed is that if user has multiple apple products iphonesipads with the same ID and that purchased app moves through cloud to those other devices then he will have to click on the purchase item button again to unlock the features on those other apps. since I will be setting the NSUserDefaults variable locally and setting it TRUE if purchase was successful or purchase restored Though he wont get double charged though its annoying for the user to click on the button again. p  pIs there a better approach I can take p  pOR p  pIs there a way in code I can check if he had purchased that app ON LAUNCH so that I can set the NSUserDefaults purchased to TRUE. p

Negative 21 pHello fellow developers.p  pFirst of all I apologize beforehand for the wall of text that follows, but after a day going crazy on this, I need to call for help.p  pIve stumbled across a problem I cannot seem to solve. Ill try to describe the scenario in the best possible way.p  pTask at hand in an existing Asp.Net Mvc application, create a lookup table for an integer field, and use the textual value from the lookup in the editing view. When saving, we must first check if the lookup already has a corresponding text value for the same codeRootcode ID. If there is, use that. Otherwise, create it and then use it.p  pThe structurep  pThe data model is a graph of objects where we have the root object, a collection of level A child objects, and every level A child object has a collection of level B child objects, so something like thisp  ul liRoot with fields ul liLevel A child with fields x n ul liLevel B child with fields x nli ulli ulli ul  pThe field we have to handle is on the LevelB objects.p  pThere is a single Mvc view that handles the whole data. For collection objects, all fields are named like codelevelA1levelB1MyFieldcode, codelevelA1levelB2MyFieldcode, etc so every single field has unique name during the post. When the post happens, all values are read through a codeformCollectioncode parameter which has average 120130 keys. The keys are isolated by splitting them and looping on the numerical part of the names, values are read and parsed to the expected types and assigned to the object graph.p  pThe datalayer part backing the object graph is all stored procedures, and all the mapping both object to sproc and sproc to object is hand written. Theres a single stored procedure for the read part, which gets multiple datasets, and the method calling it reads the datasets and creates the object graph.p  pFor the saving, there are multiple sprocs, mainly a CreateRoot and UpdateRoot. When the code has to perform such tasks, the following happensp  ul liFor create scenario, CreateRoot is called, then the sprocs CreateLevelA and CreateLevelB are called in loop for each element in the graphli liFor update scenario, UpdateRoot is called, which internally deletes all LevelA and LevelB items, then the code recreates them calling the aforementioned sprocs in loop.li ul  pLast useful piece of information is that the business objects graph is used directly as a viewmodel in the view, instead of being mapped to a plain html friendly viewmodel. This is maybe what is causing me the most trouble.p  pSo now the textbox on the view handles an integer field. That field must now accept a string. The field on LevelB must remain an integer, only with a lookup table with FK of course and the text field from the lookup must be used.p  pThe approaches I tried with no successp  ul liMy first thought was to change the datatype on the property codeMyFieldcode from integer to string on the object, then change the sprocs accordingly and handle the join at sproc level Id have a consistent object for my view, and the readwrite sprocs could translate from string to integer and viceversa, but I cant do that because the join keys to retrieve the integer when writing are part of the codeRootcode item as I stated in the first lines of this wall of text, which I dont know in the codeCreateLevelBcode sproc, and changing the whole chain of calls to pass those parameters would have a huge impact on the rest of the application, so no good.li liMy next try was to keep things as they are and call some translation methods when reading, pass the integer to the view, and there call the translation method to display the text value. When saving, use the posted text to retrieve the integer. The save part would work, Id have all the parameters I need, but for the read part, Id have to instantiate the data access layer and call its method at View level, and theres no need to explain why that is a very bad choice, so I ruled this out too.li ul  pNow Im out of options or ideas anyway. Any suggestion to solve this is very welcome, and also if something is not clear enough just point it out and I will edit my post with more accurate information.p  pThanks.p

Negative 21 pHow do I programmatically figure out which Vars may affect the results of a function defined in Clojurep  pConsider this definition of a Clojure functionp  precodedef dynamic increment 3 defn f [x]    x increment codepre  pThis is a function of codexcode, but also of codeincrementcode and also of codeclojure.corecodesup1sup but Im less concerned with that. When writing tests for this function, I want to make sure that I control all relevant inputs, so I do something like thisp  precodeassert  binding [increment 3] f 1 4 assert  binding [increment 1] f 1 0 codepre  pImagine that codeincrementcode is a configuration value that someone might reasonably change I dont want this functions tests to need changing when this happens.p  pMy question is how do I write an assertion that the value of codef 1code can depend on codeincrementcode but not on any other Var Because I expect that one day someone will refactor some code and cause the function to bep  precodedefn f [x]    x increment additionalincrement codepre  pand neglect to update the test, and I would like to have the test fail even if codeadditionalincrementcode is zero.p  pThis is of course a simplified example ndash in a large system, there can be lots of dynamic Vars, and they can get referenced through a long chain of function calls. The solution needs to work even if codefcode calls codegcode which calls codehcode which references a Var. It would be great if it didnt claim that codewithoutstr prn foocode depends on codeoutcode, but this is less important. If the code being analyzed calls codeevalcode or uses Java interop, of course all bets are off.p  pI can think of three categories of solutionsp  ol lipGet the information from the compilerp  pI imagine the compiler does scan function definitions for the necessary information, because if I try to refer to a nonexistent Var, it throwsp  precodeusergt defn g [x] if true x  foobar x CompilerException java.lang.RuntimeException Unable to resolve symbol foobar in this context, compilingNOSOURCEPATH24  codepre  pNote that this happens at compile time, and regardless of whether the offending code will ever be executed. Thus the compiler should know what Vars are potentially referenced by the function, and I would like to have access to that information.pli lipParse the source code and walk the syntax tree, and record when a Var is referencedp  pBecause code is data and all that. I suppose this means calling codemacroexpandcode and handling each Clojure primitive and every kind of syntax they take. This looks so much like a compilation phase that it would be great to be able to call parts of the compiler, or somehow add my own hooks to the compiler.pli lipInstrument the Var mechanism, execute the test and see which Vars get accessedp  pNot as complete as the other methods what if a Var is used in a branch of the code that my test fails to exercise but this would suffice. I imagine I would need to redefine codedefcode to produce something that acts like a Var but records its accesses somehow. pli ol  hr  psup1 Actually that particular function doesnt change if you rebind codecode but in Clojure 1.2 you can bypass that optimization by making it codedefn f [x]  x 0 incrementcode and then you can have fun with codebinding [ ] f 3code. In Clojure 1.3 attempting to rebind codecode throws an error.supp

Negative 21 pIm using NSCoding to manage a custom object with a few different fields, one of them images. Im only targeting iOS 5.0 and have switched to ARC. I have everything working but am focused on performanceI havent seen a question like this asked, so here it goesp  pI transform the UIImage into NSData and add it to the main NSCoding file a plist, if it matters for storage on the disk. If there is more than one image, the image names become sequential e.g. image1, image2, image3. I then use the image both in a UITableView as a resized thumbnail and in a detail view. The negative side to this is that the plist balloons in size, which means slow initial load times when I use it because its loading all of the NSData at once.p  pWhat is the best way to eliminate this problem and only force the loading of one image at a timep  pstrongWhat Ive thought ofstrong p  pI write the NSData to the disk, add an array to the plist, and add only a reference to the filename of each image to the array. I suppose Id then reference the image filename at specified position, find it on the disk, and use it p  pAny and all thoughts would be most welcome.

Some of this images will be as wide as 1700px and here comes the first problem and question.p  pChecking the html and css youll see a div with an id of gallery that is holding all the images. Its absolute positioned and Im setting its width to 4800px not enough to hold all the images that are all floated to the left. If you change this width to 5000px, it will be enough to hold all the images and everything will be fine as it should be but...p  pQuestion 01 Why do I need to set the divgallery width Ill have other sections like that with different imagessizes and I cant preview how wide it will need to be. I just want it to go as wide as its needed and if I need to add more images later, I want it to push it as wide as needed.p  pQuestion 02 First note how I set the left position of the gallery div to 150px. Well, once I have the first question solved, I will probably set the html tag to  overflowx hidden . And use a horizontal scroll that will be as wide as the website  920px, right below the images, and I want the images to scroll with a jQuery scroll from the hidden right like  left 0px  to the hidden left like  left 3980px  of the browser and viceversa, as the user uses the scroll... This scroll will need to calculate the width of the gallery div and all... Can someone point me to a jQuery plugin that will help me do that Im thinking about jscrollpane httpjscrollpane.kelvinluck.com but I really dont know if it will do.p  pThanks for the helpp

Im not really using TplDataflow to its maximum potential. ATM Im simply using codeBufferBlockcode as a safe queue for message passing, where producer and consumer are running at different rates. Im seeing some strange behaviour that leaves me stumped as to how to  proceed.p  precodeprivate BufferBlockltobjectgt messageQueue  new BufferBlockltobjectgt  public void Sendobject message      var acceptedmessageQueue.Postmessage     logger.InfoSend message was called qlen  0 accepted1,     messageQueue.Count,accepted   public async Taskltobjectgt GetMessageAsync      try              var m  await messageQueue.ReceiveAsyncTimeSpan.FromSeconds30         despite messageQueue.Countgt0 next line          occasionally does not execute         logger.Infomessage received         .......          catchTimeoutException              do something       codepre  pIn the code above which is part of a 2000 line distributed solution, codeSendcode is being called periodically every 100ms or so. This means an item is codePostcodeed to codemessageQueuecode at around 10 times a second. This is verified. However, occasionally it appears that codeReceiveAsynccode does not complete within the timeout i.e. the codePostcode is not causing codeReceiveAsynccode to complete and codeTimeoutExceptioncode is being raised after 30s. At this point, codemessageQueue.Countcode is in the hundreds. This is unexpected. This problem has been observed at slower rates of posting too 1 postsecond and usually happens before 1000 items have passed through the codeBufferBlockcode.p  pSo, to work around this issue, I am using the following code, which works, but occasionally causes 1s latency when receiving due to the bug above occurringp  precode    public async Taskltobjectgt GetMessageAsync              try                      object m             var attempts  0             for                                 try                                      m  await messageQueue.ReceiveAsyncTimeSpan.FromSeconds1                                  catch TimeoutException                                      attempts                     if attempts gt 30 throw                     continue                                  break                            logger.Infomessage received             .......                  catchTimeoutException                      do something              codepre  pThis looks like a race condition in TDF to me, but I cant get to the bottom of why this doesnt occur in the other places where I use codeBufferBlockcode in a similar fashion. Experimentally changing from codeReceiveAsynccode to codeReceivecode doesnt help. I havent checked, but I imagine in isolation, the code above works perfectly. Its a pattern Ive seen documented in Introduction to TPL Dataflow a hrefhttpwww.microsoft.comdownloadendetails.aspxid14782 relnofollowtpldataflow.docxa.p  pWhat can I do to get to the bottom of this Are there any metrics that might help infer whats happening If I cant create a reliable test case, what more information can I offerp  pHelpp

However, I cannot determine, either from the documentation nor several GoogleStackOverflow searches, how I can create another view or maybe its not consider a view and have it included on every single view.

Negative 21 pIm trying to get a PhoneGap application for Android running using Eclipse with PhoneGap for Andoroid plugin featuring a Google Map. Essentially it seems to work. However, there some glitches when displaying the map. I have no phone at hand, only the emulator. The map looks, for example, like the picture belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comF0Rxa.png altenter image description herep  pThe controls and this Terms of Use are all there, but there are parts missing from the map. When I move the map it slides also emptygrey areas. But after refreshingreloading, parts of the map vanish again. And its not always the same area, sometimes smaller, sometimes a bit larger. But never the full area is filled with the map.p  pIs this an errorglitch of the emulator. When searching for problems I only stumble upon the issue that the map is not displayed at all e.g., layout is 0px0px or the API key is missing. I also have a native Android application, and there die Activity with a Google Map is displayed quite fine.p  pThanks for any hintsp

The app uses ASIHTTPRequest to call a REST web service over HTTPHTTPS and return data via JSON.  Ive never had any issues with this while testing the app on the simulatoriPhoneiPod TouchiPad  data is returned fine and if there is a network issue then the request times out gracefully.  However in the version downloaded from the app store, the user is able to login and perform a few basic requests but once they request anything further, or attempt to download a file, it just sits waiting and never times out.  Its as if the request is not even sent because my server shows no record of the HTTP request using WireShark.p  pHas anybody experienced similar differencesproblems with their app in the app store vs running the app from a locally installed versionp

Negative 21 pI use codetermmodecode to run Bash shells within Emacs. On remote hosts, codetermmodecodes directory tracking feature helpfully sets codedefaultdirectorycode to have the host name in it, so that tab completion and file access is done remotely via Tramp. Sometimes, however, I use remote hosts that mostly share the same filesystems as my workstation, as they load the same directories from NFS. In these cases, Tramp slows me down too much. I would like, when using these systems, for Emacs to set the codedefaultdirectorycode locally. To do this I have copied codetermhandleansiterminalmessagescode from the system codeterm.elcode to a new file loaded by my code.emacscode.

Negative 21 pThis is my second post on this topic as the first post I got no help with. I dont know if anyone knows how to help me, but I have searched and searched and I cannot figure out how to fix this problem that I have been trying to overcome for 4 days now. I have made a simple web browser that needs to load iCloud.com when a button is pressed. When I try to load the page, it tells me the web browser is not supported. I am using Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate and I am programming it in C. I have everything fully updated and I have also tried to use different browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Internet Explorer. I can load this page outside of VS with all of these browsers, but inside VS it will not work. My program can load every other page I throw at it except iCloud.com. If I try and load YouTube.com I get this You are using Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 web browser. YouTube is ending support for Internet Explorer 7 soon, update your browser now. I dont know how to change the browser version inside of VS. Can anyone point me in a direction that will help me Thank you for your timep
Negative 21 pIm creating a system using ASP.NET MVC for filling out online job applications. Its really just an experiment to familiarize myself with the MVC framework. Im definitely not a security expert so I just wanted to get some advice here since this web app will be dealing with sensitive information.p  pThe system has a wizardlike set of views. You go from one view to the next filling out the relevant information until the end when you finally submit it.p  pEach job application is stored in the database with a GUID primary key. Right now I am simply storing that GUID in a hidden field in the view of each page. This makes it easy to update the model in the controller like sop  precode[HttpPost] public ActionResult ExampleActionFormCollection formValues      Guid appId  new GuidRequest.Form[ModelId]  the GUID stored in the hidden field     ExampleModel example  db.Entities.Singlee gt e.ModelId  appId      UpdateModelexample, formValues     db.SaveChanges      return RedirectToActionExampleAction2, new  appId  appId.ToString   codepre  pI know this is not secure because anyone with any kind of development experience knows you can edit the values of hidden fields in any browsers developer tools. So whats the recommended way to securely get the same resultsp

Negative 21 pWe are building a set of web applications which all utilize their own unique role providers using sql server and utilizing Windows Identity Foundation to provide a Secure Token service to handle the membership using Active Directory.  This solution also provides the benefit of single sign on.  One oversight was only allowing users a single session.  Tracking if the user already has an active session seems easy enough to implement, its what and how to deal with a users session if its determined they are already logged on elsewhere . p  pMy question is what is the recommended approach for killing an existing user session if the user attempts to spawn an additional session  Would also like to advise the user that an existing session has been detected and by continuing, that existing session will be terminated. This part also seems trivial  p  pExample Scenario with 2 web apps and a STS Identity appp  ul liUser attempts to access application Ali liSTS Identity extension determines user is not already logged on, provides a claim and caches a usersession identifier.li liUser attempts to access application B on different computer. they  can access application B if using the same sessionli liSTS Identity determines user has active session and denies logon.li ul  pThere seem to be some other issuer to overcome, for example.p  ul liHow to update the logged on user cache from the application A if the user is actively keeping their session alive.li liHow would you deal with the user not explicitly logging off, say by closing the browser or the session timing out.li liOther problemsli ul  pAny guidance would be appreciated.p

Since declaring anonymous structs in the for loop is not allowed though I have to make the macro less intuitive to use. I could not possible outsource the declaration to the rest of the tree since it uses a variable length array.p

Negative 21 pI have a query regarding MVVM and MVC. I am developing an Desktop Client and Web application. I intend to use WPF and MVVM to develop desktop client and ASP.Net MVC for web app.p  pI have never used ASP.Net MVC before although I have never truly liked Web Forms except some features like Master Page, output Cache etc. and I mostly use AJAX jQuery, and handlers to populate HTML and processing inputs I think I was close to MVC after reading about the pattern but in a different way.p  pNow these applications will mostly have same inputs, reports, and database. I am planning to create Model that can be reused in MVVM and MVC both. But after reading various articles on these pattern, and analysis of ASP.Net MVC Code, I doubt that it could be done. In MVVM, View never knows Model while in MVC, Controller shares Model with View. Also, in ASP.Net MVC, a View ASPX file is derived from System.Web.Mvc.ViewPage and the labelscaptions are populated from Model itself.p  pIs there a way I can use same Model for both applicationsp  pThank you.p  pRiteshp

Negative 21 pIm very new to JavaScript so forgive me if this question is naiveobvious. Im using jQuery UI drag and drop and the jQuery Collision Detection library from this site a hrefhttperuciform.comstaticjquerycollisionjquerycollisiondragcollisionexample.html relnofollowhttperuciform.comstaticjquerycollisionjquerycollisiondragcollisionexample.htmla. Although I have no problems detecting which divs are colliding with each other and doing things to said divs with this.collisions.collisionclass.eachfunction ..., I havent been able to find this list of divs that have NOT collided with each other or the target collider, at least not an elegant solution and the reason is I wanted to do other actions on those remaining, uncollided divs. p  pDoes anyone know of an elegant way to find which divs have not collided without resorting to brute force e.g., add all such divs to a collection and every time there is a collision event check which ones from original collection are not in the resulting collision collection The example source code via the link above seems to simply add and remove dynamic div overlays on portions of original divs that are collided, but that doesnt tell me how to detect notcollided divs...p

Negative 21 pWhile working on a C project with Visual C Express 2010 Ive found an interesting issue that Id like to understand. The problem is that the result of my program is different if I compile in Debug or Release modes. I made a small program to reproduce itp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt   int firstargint i      printfFirst argument called with i  dn, i      return i   int secondargint i      printfSecond argument called with i  dn, i      return i   void functionint i, int j      printfFunction called with d, dn, i,j   int mainint argc, char argv[]        Line with the problem     for int i  0 i lt 5  functionfirstargi, secondargi       return 0    Result on RELEASE Second argument called with i  0 First argument called with i  0 Function called with 0, 0 Second argument called with i  1 First argument called with i  1 Function called with 1, 1 Second argument called with i  2 First argument called with i  2 Function called with 2, 2 Second argument called with i  3 First argument called with i  3 Function called with 3, 3 Second argument called with i  4 First argument called with i  4 Function called with 4, 4   Result on DEBUG Second argument called with i  0 First argument called with i  1 Function called with 1, 0 Second argument called with i  1 First argument called with i  2 Function called with 2, 1 Second argument called with i  2 First argument called with i  3 Function called with 3, 2 Second argument called with i  3 First argument called with i  4 Function called with 4, 3 Second argument called with i  4 First argument called with i  5 Function called with 5, 4 codepre  pAs you see, in both cases the second argument is evaluated before the first one that one I expected, if arguments are processed in some kind of LIFO stack but in release the increment of the variable i is optimized away and delayed until the next iteration of the loop. That was unexpected, and Id really would like to understand whats going on.p  pOf course, I can easily fix my code by changing the loop to p  precode    for int i  0 i lt 5 i functionfirstargi1, secondargi  codepre  pwhich will give always the same result regardless of compilation parameters. But, still, what I would really like to understand the reasons behind this optimization of increments. p  pPS. By the way, I could not reproduce this problem with gcc under linux Debug with O0 flag, Release with O3.p

Negative 21 pI have considered posting this question on a hrefhttpgamedev.stackexchange.comGameDeva since my case relates to a game project, but I figured this would be more suited for a broader programming SE. Please let me know if this question would be better posted there after all.p  pFrom my understanding  and please correct me if Im wrong , game development for mobile which is my case can benefit considerably from employing fixed point calculations, since that would assure more consistency betweens platforms and would be an increase in performance in cases where the device isnt wellequiped to deal with floating point appropriately.p  pBut fixedpoint does have limitations, most notably with overflows. So my question is, assuming we have determined that fixedpoint is the best alternative given the target platforms, how to determine if a given projects requirements allow for their use.p  pTo make things clearer, Id like to share a bit of code Im having trouble withp  precodeCIwVec2 calculateBezierfloat t, CIwVec2 p0, CIwVec2 p1, CIwVec2 p2      float u  1  t      CIwVec2 p  IWFIXEDu  u  p0    1  tP0     p  IWFIXED2  u  t  p1       21  ttP1     p  IWFIXEDt  t  p2           tP2      return p  codepre  pIn this project Im using a hrefhttpmadewithmarmalade.com relnofollowMarmalade SDKa, which uses C and comes with their own implementation of fixedpoint numbers they have both 16 and 32bit, Im using 32bit as of now, and a Vector class CIwVec2 which uses that implementation for position and calculations including scalar multiplication, which is shown in the code above. Oh, and IWFIXED is just a macro to convert floats to fixedpoint.p  pWhen I try to run the above code, I get a strongMultiply overflowstrong error. Debug values as followsp  precodet  0 u  1 which converts to 4096 in int32 fixedpoint with IWFIXED p0.x  1638400 400.0f with IWFIXEDTOFLOAT p0.y  409600 100.0f with IWFIXEDTOFLOAT codepre  pTo be perfectly honest, I dont have a complete understanding on fixedpoint numbers. I understand the idea, but fixed point operations arent entirely clear to me I must have ditched most math classes relating to base 2, shame on me. But Im completely boggled by the fact that something as simple as 1.0f  400.0f would cause an overflow in fixedpoint.p  pSo, while I thought I wouldnt have a problem supporting fixedpoint in my project, it appears it might not be the case. The game is a topdown car game, which wont have huge tracks or anything, but theyll have to be at least as big as the devices screen or better yet, its resolution, and since were aiming for tablets as well, having trouble with something like 1.0f  400.0f means fixedpoint is out of the question.p  pAm I correct with this assumption And, for future projects and for other people with similar problems, how can we assess the viability of fixedpoint numbers in a project Also how to decide between 16bit and 32bit would be a great bonus p  pSorry for the long post and thanks for your timep  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pSo, so sum up a bit of the responses so far. The ideal scenario would be to implement your fixedpoint numbers in such a way as to have the necessary range for your needs Mooing Ducks anwer. Also, for operations with 32bit numbers, the safest thing to do is to calculate using 64bit timdays answer and Maxs comment. By the way, Marmalade does have some safe fixed multiplication functions, but its not the case with the scalar multiplication operator overload for CIwVec2 which uses codeIWFIXEDMULcode underneath, which does not mupliply safely.p  pAnd lastly, more in regards to my particular scenario, it appears that as of Marmalade 6.1, just using floats would probably be the best solution.p  pstrongEditstrong Although Maxs answer really solved my problem, it was mostly because it was something specific to Marmalade. Because of that, I have selected Mooing Ducks answer as the selected answer since I feel is the one which would help out more people in general.p
Negative 21 pIm currently working on an ASP.Net Website running in Sharepoint.

Negative 21 pI have a web app from visual studio that is using local IIS server to run. It is an MVC 3 application.  I setup the application pool in my IIS win 7 pro to use a service account for the application identity.  When I browse the site I am getting permission errors for a function on the site which I would not get if it was using the service account.  This has been tested by using same service account on a development server as the application pool identity.  Application executes with no errors.  Could there be something in my local security policy preventing the service account from being usedbr Service account is also a member of IISIUSRS group.br This is a network service.p
Negative 21 pIm using XJC to generate Java classes from the HTNG Payment Systems schemas, available in the schemas directory of a hrefhttpcollaboration.htng.orgspecsdocuments22372SecureDataProxyArtifactsFINAL.zip relnofollowthis zipa.p  pIf I run XJC without passing the codepcode parameter, generation works fine, and classes are generated under the codeorg.htng.2009bcode packagep  precode cd schemas  xjc markgenerated noheader target 2.1 npa . codepre  pAll I want to do is change the package name of the generated classes to something more project appropriate, e.g. codecom.justin.htngcodep  precode cd schemas  xjc markgenerated noheader target 2.1 npa p com.justin.htng . codepre  pHowever, doing this breaks JAXB generation spectacularly, throwing collision errors on almost every element.  I can work around this by generating the classes via the first method, and then refactoring them to the codecom.justin.htngcode package, but thats not very maintainable and doesnt port well to the mavenjaxb2plugin.  p  pstrongCan someone explain why this is happening, and if there is a way to work around it with XJCstrong  I feel like if JAXB works via the first method, it should work via the second, since all that needs to be done is a simple String substitution for the package name.  I suppose I could use the second method and handle all of the collisions via an .xjb bindings file, but that would be tedious given the number of errors.p

Negative 21 pI have a seemingly simple problem, but an easy solution is alluding me.  I have a very large series tens or hundreds of thousands of points, and I just need to visualize it at different zoom levels, but generally zoomed well out.  Basically, I want to plot it in a tool like Matlab or Pyplot, but knowing that each pixel cant represent the potentially many hundreds of points that map to it, Id like to see both the min and the max of all the array entries that map to a pixel, so that I can generally understand whats going on.  Is there a simple way of doing thisp

Negative 21 pI have an Application which requires data from Service2, which will return the same answer for a given request, forever, unless its backing database is updated. The database is updated very rarely, lets say twice per year.p  pI would like to design a solution so that the Application caches the answers from Service2, but to externally provide a feature so as to invalidate the cache of Application. I thought of exposing a RESTful webservice from the Application, but I am confused on how to design it correctly.p  pcodeapplicationcacheinvalidatecode is a non RESTful URL  I was thinking about codeapplicationcachecode to be called with HTTP POST. However, it looks to me that for a proper RESTful design, when POST is used to update a resource, the content to update should be contained in the body of the request.p  pWhat is the right way to design a InvalidateCache restful webservicep

The algorithm works fine but I have to free ar1 and ar2 to get rid of immense memory leaks on huge input data but every time I try, I get invalid reads.

Negative 21 pI am attempting to write a clientserver library for letting my LAN computers talk to each other. As this is largely a selfeducation attempt, I am trying to make these connections occur over SSL. My plan is to maintain a single host machine, and have each client maintain a mutually authenticated System.Net.SslStream instance to the host. The host code looks roughly speaking like this error handling omitted for brevityp  precodeSslStream newStream  null newStream  new SslStreamthis.client.GetStream, false newStream.AuthenticateAsServer     this.Certificate as X509Certificate,     true,     System.Security.Authentication.SslProtocols.Tls,     false  if      newStream.IsMutuallyAuthenticated ampamp     newStream.IsEncrypted ampamp     newStream.IsSigned      throw new AuthenticationExceptionAuthentication results unsatisfactory.  codepre  pIn this, codethis.Certificatecode is an X509Certificate2.

I then generated certificates for both client and server, put copies of the .cer file in places accessible to the clientserver loaded to get the X509Certificate objects and installed the with private keys in the Personal stores for the respective machines. Now, everything works when the client and server are on the same machine. But when I generate a new cert and put it on a second machine, the client and server now fail to mutually authenticate. The connection gets set up, encrypted and signed, but IsMutuallyAuthenticated is false. How can I fix this What am I doing wrongp  pEdit LocalCertificateSelectionCallback and the other callback tell me that the client finds one local certificate, which is mine, no remote certificates, and no acceptable issuers. My certificate is selected and returned from the local certificate selection. There are no SSL policy errors on the client end, and on the host end, I still get RemoteCertificateNotAvailable. Sniffing this transaction with Wireshark, I see a standard TCP handshake, followed by a few hundred bytes of gibberish which includes the name of the host cert, and then the FIN, ACK packets that mark the end of the transaction. So the client certificate indeed isnt being sent, even though its selected by the LocalCertificateSelectionCallback routine. What might cause this How can I fix itp

Each cell in this magrid has either a Hungarian horntail dragon that our intrepid hero has to defeat, or a flask of magic potion that his teacher Snape has left for him. A dragon at a cell i,j takes away S[i][j] strength points from him, and a potion at a cell i,j increases Harrys strength by S[i][j]. If his strength drops to 0 or less at any point during his journey, Harry dies, and no magical stone can revive him.p  pHarry starts from the topleft corner cell 1,1 and the Sorcerers Stone is in the bottomright corner cell R,C. From a cell i,j, Harry can only move either one cell down or right i.e., to cell i1,j or cell i,j1 and he can not move outside the magrid. Harry has used magic before starting his journey to determine which cell contains what, but lacks the basic simple mathematical skill to determine what minimum strength he needs to start with to collect the Sorcerers Stone. Please help him once again.p  blockquote   pInput STDINp      pThe first line contains the number of test cases T. T cases follow.

Negative 21 pHow do I play a sound simultaneously with the camera shutter going offp  pIn my application, I have an inset camera preview. It takes 3 pictures automatically after 5 seconds of the activity starting. During this time the application is receiving a range of values via Bluetooth. Everytime the values are greater than a preset threshold, the application plays a tone, which is done using MediaPlayer.p  pThe problem is that when the camera goes off, the shutter click sound seems to take over all the audio, and the tone being played stops and only resumes after the 3 shutter clicks. I dont want to silence the camera shutter, so is there a way I can get the tone to play with shutter clicks This is all happening in one activity.p  pThanksp

Negative 21 pI dont think this is an actual JS error, but the symptoms are JS related. I have a Magento 1.7.0.2 installation with SCP Simple Configurable Products which works 100 as I wantexpect. In my early development I added some methods to 1 specific file in the SCP module, codeappcodecommunityOrganicInternetSimpleConfigurableProductsCatalogModelProductTypeConfigurable.phpcode.p  pWith these methods inside of the SCP module everything works, however I realise now I really should have created an additional module in the local code pool that extends SCP and put my additional methods in there. So I created BendartMatrix. I cut the 3 methods out of SCPs codeConfigurable.phpcode and placed them in my own module, codeappcodelocalBendartMatrixCatalogModelProductTypeConfigurable.phpcode. Whilst the page still loads, there appear to be some JS errors which ultimately relate to the codeProductcode JS Object not being created correctly. It doesnt get created with the code.Optionscode method like it does when my methods are part of SCP.p  pI cant find a logical reason as to why this is, so Ive created some gists of my module Configurable.php, config.xml and BendartMatrix.xml and the same files from SCP. Once again, if I disable or remove my module and switch the methods back to SCP files, it works.

Negative 21 pFrom DDD Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software  pg 268 p  blockquote   pIf implementer has state that is used in the computation, then   implementer is effectively an argument of the operation, so the   arguments and return value should be of the same type as the   implementer. Such an operation is closed under the set of instances of   that type.p blockquote  pa I understand that making emargumentsem, emreturn valueem and emimplementerem of same type would simplify an interpretation of operation, but  is author suggesting that even though conceptually it would make more sense for emargumentsem and emreturn valueem not to be of the same type  say codeImplTypecode  as implementer, we should still try to force them to be codeImplTypecode, even if it means well have to sacrifice a bit of conceptual clarity p  pb My thinking is, if it made more sense for emargumentsem and emreturn valueem to be of type codeImplTypecode, then we would already define them as such,  even if we didnt know anything about emClosure of Operationsem and its benefits. Shouldnt the fact that we initially made them of different type be an indication that conceptually it is better theyre not of type codeImplTypecodep  pThank youp

Since I only have one column in my DGV and the property that it displays is initialized to string.Empty, I basically have a DGV that contains 100,000 blank rows.  At this point, my user can begin editing the rows to enter strings.  They dont have to edit them in any order so they might put one string in the first row, the next string in row 17, the next string in row 24581, etc.  Sometimes, my users will want to import strings from text file.  Since I have a fixed number of objects 100,000 and there may or may not be some existing strings already entered, I have a few checks to perform during the import process before I add a new string.  In the code below, Ive removed those checks but they dont seem to impact the performance of my application.  However, if I import tens of thousands of strings using the code below, its very slow like 4 or 5 minutes to import 50k lines.

If I select purpose and enter values for three text fields for example, the values of the text fields are still on the form but the radio button is unchecked even though purpose has a value.p  pI found this link a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12161135howtosetthevalueofradiobuttonaftersubmittingformHow to set the value of radio button after submitting forma and developed the following code in my controllerp  precode  def checkradiobutton      case params[purpose]     when 1       radiobuttontagpurpose, 1, checked gt true     when 2       radiobuttontagpurpose, 2, checked gt true     when 3       radiobuttontagpurpose, 3, checked gt true     when 4       radiobuttontagpurpose, 4, checked gt true     when 5       radiobuttontagpurpose, 5, checked gt true     end    end codepre  pWhen I tried to display my view selecting the first radio button purpose  1 I got the following errorp  precodeundefined method radiobuttontag for ltPagesController0x007f94d05c5e88gt codepre  pThe line where it got the error was the one where params[purpose]  1 showing that purpose is populated properly.p  pOther examples about checking the radio button were used with formfor where databases were updated.p  pAny help would be appreciated.

I dont understand why though.p  pIts pretty simple, click a button and read files in a directory, displaying them back.p  precode        ltStackPanel xNameContentPanel Margin12,0,12,0 Grid.Row1 gt         ltButton ContentShow files ClickButtonClick1gt          ltListBox xNamelbgt             ltListBox.ItemTemplategt                 ltDataTemplategt                     ltStackPanelgt                         ltTextBlock TextBinding Name gt                         ltImage xNameimg SourceBinding Path Width100 Height100gt                     ltStackPanelgt                 ltDataTemplategt             ltListBox.ItemTemplategt         ltListBoxgt          ltphoneLongListSelector HorizontalAlignmentLeft                                  xNamellsFiles                                  ItemTemplateStaticResource FilesDataTemplate                                 gt      ltStackPanelgt codepre  pand the LLS templatep  precodeltphonePhoneApplicationPage.Resourcesgt     ltDataTemplate xKeyFilesDataTemplategt         ltTextBlock TextBinding Namegt     ltDataTemplategt ltphonePhoneApplicationPage.Resourcesgt codepre  pthen the codebehindp  precode    private void ButtonClick1object sender, RoutedEventArgs e              GetPackageFiles           private async Task GetPackageFiles              Get the folder where the app is installed on the phone.         var installFolder  Package.Current.InstalledLocation         var imagesFolder   await installFolder.GetFolderAsyncImages          var fileList  await imagesFolder.GetFilesAsync          lb.ItemsSource  fileList          llsFiles.ItemsSource  fileList.ToList      codepre
Negative 21 pI really got stuck with drawing roads on Pixmap in Qt.  I have all coordinates in fractional value which are very close to each other Ive got them from converting longitudelatitude to XY coordinates using Mercators formulas.

Moreover, the coordinate starts with top left corner so I need to change it, like thisp  precodeXold  x Ynew  Ymax  Y codepre  pNow I have ordinary XY coordinate system, with Yaxis going to top and Xaxis going to left. p  pHeres my code, how I trying to draw linesp  precode    double minlat  637800logtan3.1443.14bounds[1]360.0log2.71,maxlat637800logtan3.1443.14bounds[2]360.0log2.71     stdvectorltdoublegt x     stdvectorltdoublegt y     QSize size  uigtlabel2gtsize     sizeuigtlabel2gtsize     QImage picsize.width,size.height,QImageFormatARGB32Premultiplied     pic.fillQttransparent     QPainter painteramppic     for unsigned int i0 i lt wayVector.size i         for unsigned int j0 jltwayVector[i].refs.size j             x.pushback6378003.14nodeHash[wayVector[i].refs[j]].lon180.0             y.pushback637800logtan3.1443.14nodeHash[wayVector[i].refs[j]].lat360.0log2.71                   for unsigned int j0 jltwayVector[i].refs.size1j             painter.setPenQtgreen             double x1  x[j]size.widthmaxlonminlon             double y1  maxlatsize.heightmaxlatminlaty[j]size.heightmaxlatminlat             double x2  x[j1]size.widthmaxlonminlon             double y2  maxlatsize.heightmaxlatminlaty[j1]size.heightmaxlatminlat             painter.drawLinex1,y1,x2,y2                  x.clear         y.clear      codepre  pBut as soon as I put x1,y1,x2,y2 to drawLine function they converts to integer and everything goes wrong, because all XYcoordinates become the same because of they are very close.p  pI really dont know how I could draw this lines on a pixmap.

Negative 21 pIve never dealt much with NSViews so I am at a loss on this.  I have a custom class that contains an codeNSImagecode ivar.  I also have a subclass of codeNSViewcode that contains an array of instances of my custom class.

Negative 21 pI know those errors in the headline are nothing new, but in this constellation I have here its rather strange and I dont find a solution that is helping. So let me explain.p  pIm working with boost.python, Visual Studio 2012 and the tutorial from the developers site. So as i finally fixed all linker problems and imports I got the first tutorial workingp  precodechar const greet     return hello, world   include ltboostpython.hppgt using namespace boostpython  BOOSTPYTHONMODULEhelloext      using namespace boostpython     defgreet, greet  codepre  pWorks fine.p  pNow Im trying the whole thing with a class, that I can create an object in python.

What cracks my head is that I used the same project settings for my class exposure example I cant explain why i get a linker error again. When I try to only expose the method greet byp  precodedefgreet, greet codepre  pin the BOOSTPYTHONMODULE block, I can build it but get an import error in python such asp  precodemodule does not define init function codepre  pIts so strange that its a linker error, because I triple checked and compared the settings to my project with simple greet function. Do I maybe have to change some settings when trying to expose classes Or am I doing something horribly wrong Any Suggestionsp  pGreetings Chrisp

Negative 21 pIve created a codeListViewcode in a new codeWPFcode window and also a function that populates the ListView when it is called.

Negative 21 pIm attempting to implement an FM synthesis operator with feedback using a phase accumulator in C.  In Tomisawas a hrefhttpsdocs.google.comviewerurlpatentimages.storage.googleapis.compdfsUS4249447.pdf relnofolloworiginal patenta, the phase accumulator going into the adder counts over both negative and positive indices, from 2n1 at a sine wave phase of pi to 2n1 at a phase of pi.  For simplicitys sake, Id like to use a phase accumulator that counts only over positive values, using the top bytes of an unsinged 32 bit integer as an index into a sine table lookup.  p  pI have experimented with this and unfortunately I cant seem to get the algorithm to produce the expected results when using feedback.  Adding the sine wave output to the phase accumulator should produce a sawtooth like waveform, but I cant figure out how to properly add the output sine wave which is a 16 bit signed int to the unsigned phase accumulator to produce this.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pSome clarification is probably in order.  Here are some diagrams from Tomisawas original patentp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGz9Wo.png altalgorithmp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYDXmn.png altoutputp  pWhen both the phase accumulator and the sine wave output are signed, the algorithm is straightforward enough to implement.  The phase accumulator starts at 1 and runs to 1, and the sine wave output is also between 1 and 1.  In Python, the algorithm looks sort of like this to generate 1000 samplesp  precodetable  [] feedback  0.25 accumulator  1  for i in xrange1000     output  math.sinmath.piaccumulator  feedbackoutput     table[i]  output     accumulator  0.005     if accumulator gt 1         accumulator  1 codepre  pWhich produces an ouput that looks as followsp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTQiWW.png altoutputp  pI am trying to adapt this algorithm to C.  In C, for purposes of computational efficiency, I would like the phase accumulator to be a 32 bit unsigned integer rather than a signed integer.  That way, I can use the first two bits of the high byte of the accumulator as a quadrant index, and the second high byte as an index into an array of 256 16 bit sine values, for a 1024 value sine table.  Likep  precodeXXXXXXQQ.IIIIIIII.XXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXX          quadrant    index codepre  pMy problem is that I am having difficulty adapting the FM algorithm as given to an unsigned phase accumulator.  If the phase accumulator is an unsigned 32 bit int, and the sine wave table output is a signed or unsigned 16 bit integer, how can I adapt the algorithm as shown in the patent and the Python code above to work with this format, and produce the same outputp

Negative 21 pIm currently building a login page with multiple fields and Facebook login. On this page I have 2 inputs, username and password, along with three other divs. These divs are graphical elements and a facebook login button. p  pIm having difficulties with the password field though.

Negative 21 pI have a ViewPager backed by a FragmentPagerAdapter. Each page is a ListFragment. I need to show an ad in each page. Currently the ad is loaded in the ListAdapter.getView. This results in unnecessary ad loads when the pages are swiped in quick succession or when swiping back to previously viewed pages since they have been destroyed and need to be recreated. I need the ad to be part of the list view so they can be scrolled away, instead of taking up a fixed space on the screen.p  pI tried keeping an array of ads in the parent activity and reuse these across the fragments. It seems to work, but with random strange behavior. Partial ad going behind the first list item, partial ad getting truncated and not visible, etc. Scrolling the list up and down fixes these layout problems.p  pIs this the right way to do it What are the other alternatives I basically want to ensure minimum ad loads from a bandwidth perspective. Many of my users will be on 2G networks.p  pI know how to put the ad outside of the list view and keep it fixed so only one ad is loaded. But Id like to go for the scrollable ad because it frees up valuable screen space.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDm3ig.png altwhat i want it to look likep

Negative 21 pIm trying to shoot a problem with a change of behavior weve seen in the iOS 7 release that perhaps others have run into.p  pWe have some code that handles resize events in our website. The way this should ideally work is that it wont get executed if youre doing a zoom e.g. a pinch zoom on a phone, but would be fired if you resized the browser window, for example.p  pWhat were finding is that on our iOS 7 devices, safari frequently fires javascript resize events when we are doing a pinch zoom. This doesnt happen all the time, and seems to only happen in landscape mode. Our iOS6 devices didnt do that, and neither do any of the Android devices we have on hand. These have two ill effectsp  p1 It seems to cause a page jump, i.e. it will suddenly reposition the page, usually to the upperleft corner. Note that this will happen even if we dont have a resize event handler. p  pI dont think its our page layout. Weve been particularly careful to avoid things that can cause behavior like fractional pixels and percentage heights and widths. Also, we can eliminate this behavior by setting the viewport width via META tag to 700px or less. Plus, we dont see any such issues in profile, as noted. we arent setting any other viewport settings, so thats not the issue and setting widthclientwidth doesnt help us.p  p2 It seems that in the resize handler, it doesnt really give us the expected values for window.innerWidth i.e. Ill be zoomed in and it will give me a largerthanexpected value. For instance, I usually use something like this to determine if were zoomingp  pabs1  document.documentElement.clientWidth  window.innerWidth lt 0.02p  pbut that doesnt seem to do the trick here.p  pUnfortunately, we will have to work around this, since the logic in our resize does a page reformatting. This page is essentially a custom online report thats frequently viewed landscape style we cant just tell our users not to zoom or rotate their phone p  pHas anyone run into these problems And if so, how did you work around itp  pAs an aside has anyone found that the latest 7.0.3 safari update sometimes doesnt let you clear the javascript alerts i.e. the OK button on the alert doesnt work, resulting in safari hanging I know there was a problem with alerts that was to have been fixed with the iOS 7.0.3 update, but perhaps there are other issues I dont know about. When we get in this state we have to restart the device.p

My final output is to be a frame of video onto a DX11 texture I want to decode some very large H.264 video files, and the CPU using libav doesnt cut it.p  pIve looked at the hwaccel capabilities of libav using DXVA2, but hit a road block when I need to create a IDirectXVideoDecoder, which can only be created with a D3D9 interface. which I dont have using DX11p  pWhenever Ive looked up DXVA documentation, it doesnt reference DX11, was this removed in DX10 or 11 Cant find any confirmation of this, nor anywhere that says DXVA2 is redundant, possibly that its been superceeded by DXVAHDp  pThen Ive looked into the media foundation SDK as that looks like what Im supposed to use for DX11... But none of the types exist in my headers The docs say to just include , but this yields nothing. They also specify a minimum of windows 8 to use it.p  pI believe to use MF I need the windows 8 SDK, which now includes all the directx libsheaders.p  pSo this leaves a gap with windows 7... Is it possible to get hardware accelerated video decoding and if so, which API am I supposed to be usingp

Its not making any ajax calls, its using data it already has from the original page load.  I could try and parse for that data, but it is embedded in javascript and its a bit obfuscated.  So evidently Im somehow getting the document completed event Before the javascript has finished running. p  pThere could eventually be a lot of pages to scrape, so waiting around for a half second or whatever is really far less than ideal. I would like to only wait until all the JavaScript that starts on document ready  page load has finished running before I examine the page.

Negative 21 pI have an outer viewgroup a ViewFlipper, and I want to programmatically put an inner view inside of it a LinearLayout. I then want a reference to that inner view so I can do things with it later. So Ill have a line like thisp  precodeinflater.inflateR.layout.mylinearlayout, myViewFlipper, true codepre  pHow can I get access to the inner view that I just inflated The android docs for LayoutInflater claim that code.inflatecode returns a reference to the root View of the inflated hierarchy, but adds that If root was supplied and attachToRoot is true, this is root, which I interpret to mean that in my case code.inflatecode will return a reference to myViewFlipper.p

Negative 21 pIm trying to figure out how to prevent the codeonBeforeUnloadcode event from being triggered in IE9 when using links without hrefs.p  pIve set up a a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netstafffanhh6pq8 relnofollowfiddlea here a simplified test of a real scenario, which pretty much describes what Im trying to accomplish. Whenever codeonBeforeUnloadcode is triggered ergo, when a link is clicked, the page background becomes blue. When using codeattachEventcode I can easily codereturn falsecode to prevent that from happen. But when adding the links click event with codeaddEventListenercode, the return statement doesnt make any difference. More or less, I would like link 4 to behave like link 2.p  pYes, changing from links to buttons would be a solution. Altering the onBeforeUnload functionality like having that code as part och the click functionality would be another. But sadly, I dont have control of those pieces of code.p  pSo. Are there any way I can stop click events on links from trigger codeonBeforeUnloadcode when set up with codeaddEventListenercode Or did MS remove this possibility when migrating from codeattachEventcode to codeaddEventListenercode, because its generally a bad idea to prevent users from navigating away from a pagep

Negative 21 pI am seeing odd behaviour with using DoctrinegetTable and running queries using it. p  pIn some cases there is little to no overhead and in othercases there is 200ms of overhead when the DoctrinegetTable is first called although little overhead for subsequent calls to the same table. p  pThe action works like this.p  pa. codeDoctrineTablecode is called to run a query the table in question was used to generate the action module files with little to no overhead on codetable Acode b. Form is saved c. codeDoctrineTablecode is called to run a query on an unrelated table codetable Bcode and has considerable overhead 200ms d. codeDoctrineTablecode is called on another table codetable Ccode to run another query with little to no overheadp  pIve tried the action with the codeDoctrineTablecode query in step c removed to see if it was general loading issue but the query in step d still runs with little or no overhead. Ive run the queries using codeDoctrineQuerycode directly in the action to see if that made the difference and the speed impact is still there.p  pIt doesnt matter what the query on the problem table is, the same overheadperformance penalty is there.p  pThe only difference with the slow table codetable Bcode is that it has the versionable behaviour where as the other tables codetable Acode and codetable Ccode dont. Could that be impacting the speed of the initial query subsequent queries to that table are fast once the first one is donep

Now my question is given that the passes in a technique are executed one after another, does each pass imply a complete passage through the rendering pipeline For istance, if I have a technique with two passes, is the following statement correct the first pass takes data for the application VertexBuffer and goes through the pipeline, than the second pass takes what the first one has spat out and goes another time through the pipeline.p

I would like to write it instead in a way that lets me check the array with for loops.p  pI realize that with tictactoe, it is fairly easy to code it using brute force, but this was the first example that came to my head. Other games like Reversi or Go would not work well like this because of either the sheer size or the fact that pieces placed can change other cells than the one they were placed on.p  pAny help with this would be greatly appreciated.p
Negative 21 pHow to connect angular controllers using data from HTML codep  pI have a serverside framework, which allows me to build an application by connecting components together. Some of these components get transformed into a bit of HTML markup. Other components only provide data for the first kind of komponents. Technical details of this part are not important.p  pExample There are two components on the server VideoPlayer and PlayButton. The PlayButton is connected to VideoPlayer. When page is rendered, VideoPlayer become codeltdiv idtheplayer classflowplayergt...ltdivgtcode and PlayButton become codeltbutton dataplayeridtheplayergt...ltbuttongtcode. So the onclick handler of the button can use codedataplayeridcode to lookup the player and make it play. VideoPlayer ID codetheplayercode is passed between the components using connections on the server, so it is possible to have two players and multiple buttons, each button controlling only specified player. Notice that these connections are not specified in JavaScript code, so changing of component connections does not affect JavaScript code in any way.p  pstrongQuestionstrong How to do such thing using Angular controllers The Angular DI is too naive and expects only one instance of each kind of service. I like the twoway binding between controller and HTML DOM, it makes my widgets very simple. But how can I connect such widget to data source addressed in HTML attributep

Negative 21 pIm using Susy 2.0. Im building a fixedwidth site that will become responsive in a later phase. However, I think my question applies when using Susy as static or fluid.p  pHere are my global settingsp  precodesusy   container auto,   columns 12,    columnwidth 62px,  math static,   gutters 13,  codepre  pAs per the Susy 2.0 docs with regard to static sites, Ive set container to be auto and Im letting the columnwidth settings dictate the width of my container elements. p  pI would like to apply a bit of left and right padding to containers, just so that theres a little bit of breathing space on either side when the viewport narrows on mobile, etc.p  pWhats the best way of doing this If I simply apply paddingleft and paddingright in plain CSS to my container element, this breaks the grid. The container is no longer wide enough to contain Susys column width calculations.p  pI have boxsizing universally set to borderbox in my CSS. If I override this on my container element, with contentbox, then the grid behaves correctly. Id have expected the opposite actually p  pIs the solution to apply boxsizing contentbox to my container elements Or is there a setting in Susy I can apply that Im missing I feel like there probably is. Id rather let Susy handle all grid calculations if possible.p  pMy question also applies to responsivefluid design too, as I still have the same issue even if I give the container setting a specific width and remove the columnwidth and math settings.p

Negative 21 pA year ago, when I did simple PHP sites for people with a simple MySQL database, I was brought up to think that storing an entire image in the database was possible but a terrible idea. Instead you should store the image in the filesystem and simply store an image path in the database. I did agree with that from the start, despite my inexperience. It must keep the database light when youre backing it up to an external service, and makes it faster during actual local use. This later point, however, is complete speculation, and Id like someone to clarify my theories p  pWhen you store the images associated with objects in the database as a BLOB, when you request this object, is the whole object and its attributes including this huge amount of image information written to memory, even when its not needed E.g.p  precode2.0.0p247 001 gt Object.columnnames  gt [id, name, blob]  2.0.0p247 001 gt Object.first.blob   gt  not sure what this will return Im guessing a matrixlike wall of image information 2.0.0p247 003 gt Object.first.name   User Load 0.8ms  SELECT users. FROM users ORDER BY users.id ASC LIMIT 1  gt Kitty  codepre  pI understand that the call to codeObject.first.blobcode will take a relatively long amount of time because were retrieving a large amount of image information. But will codeObject.first.namecode take the same amount of time because codeObject.firstcode writes everything, codeidcode, codenamecode and codeblobcode all to memory strongIf the answer to this question is yes, thats a pretty good reason to never use BLOBS. However, if the answer is no, and rails is smart enough to only write requested attributes to memory then BLOBS suddenly become very attractive.strongp  pTo be quite honest with you guys Im really crossing my fingers that youll say storing images in a BLOB is fine and dandy. Itll make things so much easier. Backing up will be simple. Itll feel very nice to back up the dynamic content of the site in one modular upload instead of resorting to some elaborate a hrefhttpsgithub.comjavanwhenever relnofollowwhenevera augmented rake task to make sure the paths and their respective images are uploaded to an external location.p  pMore so strongit is absolutely impossible to make certain images private with Railsstrong. Ive searched high, Ive searched low, Ive asked here on SO. Got a few upvotes, but no solid response. No tutorials online. Nothing. Bags of tutorials on how to store images in the assets folder, but nothing to make images private.p  pLets say I have three types of user, codetypeAcode, codetypeBcode and codetypeCcode.

Negative 21 pIve wanted to write my own portable IDE for CLisp for a while now and have recently started with it, using C. p  pI have implemented bracket highlighting by checking if the current character is a bracket and then moving backwardsforwards throughout the text, whilst keeping track of the following openingclosing brackets until the number of opening and closing brackets are equal.p  pI have done this using simple for loops also breaking the for loop as soon as the matching bracket is found, but the method is slow on larger blocks of code. The method of highlighting text in the RichTextBox also seems a bit inefficient, i.e. selecting the characters by programmatically moving the cursor and applying a highlight, then deselecting and moving back to the cursors original position. Moving away from the brackets requires the highlighting to be cleared, so I simply select all the text and then remove the formatting on it. p  pOccasionally the application cant keep track of where the cursor is supposed to be if the user moves the cursor too fast using the arrow keys on the keyboard and the application might erroneously move it back to a previous position. Simply put, the highlighting function I wrote cant keep up if the user scrolls through large blocks of code using the keyboard. p  pIs there a more efficient way of going about this other than for loops Am I simply using inefficient methods to highlight and unhighlight the brackets Could Regex offer a solution herep  pWhile I wrote my piece of code myself, in essence I have done exactly what Bill The Lizard has done here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12752225howdoifindthepositionofmatchingparenthesesorbracesinagivenpieceofHow do I find the position of matching parentheses or braces in a given piece of textap

Negative 21 pWhen we create a symlink, the number of bytes the symlink takes up is exactly the length of the path it points to. For instance,p  precode ln s dest link1  ln s longerdest link2  ls l lrwxrwxrwx 1 username  4 Mar 26 2021 link1 gt dest lrwxrwxrwx 1 username 11 Mar 26 2021 link2 gt longerdest codepre  pwhere codelink1code takes up 4 bytes, which is the length of codedestcode codelink2code takes up 11 bytes, which is the length of codelongerdestcode.

Negative 21 pI want to create an application capable to play YouTube videos audios and also save the downloaded content in a local cache, therefore when the user decides to resume or play the video again, then it doesnt have to download part of video again but only download the remaining part User can decide what to do with the cache then, and how to organize it.p  pIt is also very convenient for mobiles it is my main focus but Id like to create a desktop one too for experimental purposes.p  pSo, my question itself is, does YouTube provide any API for this I mean, in order to cache the download content I need that my application download the content and not any embed player also remember that it is a native application.

Negative 21 pI want to know whether the task explained below is even theoretically possible, and if so how I could do it. p  pYou are given a space of codeNcode elements i.e. all numbers between code0code and codeN1code. Lets look at the space of all permutations on that space, and call it codeScode. The codeicodeth member of codeScode, which can be marked codeS[i]code, is the permutation with the lexicographic number codeicode.p  pFor example, if codeNcode is 3, then codeScode is this list of permutationsp  precodeS[0] 0, 1, 2 S[1] 0, 2, 1 S[2] 1, 0, 2 S[3] 1, 2, 0 S[4] 2, 0, 1 S[5] 2, 1, 0 codepre  pOf course, when looking at a big codeNcode, this space becomes very large, codeNcode to be exact. p  pNow, I already know a hrefhttpwww.keithschwarz.cominterestingcodedirfactoradicpermutationhow to get the permutation by its index number codeicode, and I already know how to do the reverse get the lexicographic number of a given permutation.a But I want something better.p  pSome permutations can be huge by themselves. For example, if youre looking at codeN1020code. The size of codeScode would be code1020code which I believe is the biggest number I ever mentioned in a Stack Overflow question p  pIf youre looking at just a random permutation on that space, it would be so big that you wouldnt be able to store the whole thing on your harddrive, let alone calculate each one of the items by lexicographic number. What I want is to be able to do item access on that permutation, and also get the index of each item. That is, given codeNcode and codeicode to specify a permutation, have one function that takes an index number and find the number that resides in that index, and another function that takes a number and finds in which index it resides. I want to do that in codeO1code, so I dont need to store or iterate over each member in the permutation.p  pCrazy, you say Impossible That may be. But consider this A block cipher, like AES, is essentially a permutation, and it almost accomplishes the tasks I outlined above. AES has a block size of 16 bytes, meaning that codeNcode is code25616code which is around code1038code. The size of codeScode, not that it matters, is a staggering code25616code, or around code1085070591730234615865843651857942052838code, which beats my recent record for biggest number mentioned on Stack Overflow p  pEach AES encryption key specifies a single permutation on codeN25616code. That permutation couldnt be stored whole on your computer, because it has more members than there are atoms in the solar system. But, it allows you item access. By encrypting data using AES, youre looking at the data block by block, and for each block member of coderangeNcode you output the encrypted block, which the member of coderangeNcode that is in the index number of the original block in the permutation. And when youre decrypting, youre doing the reverse Finding the index number of a block. I believe this is done in codeO1code, Im not sure but in any case its very fast.p  pThe problem with using AES or any other block cipher is that it limits you to very specific codeNcode, and it probably only captures a tiny fraction of the possible permutations, while I want to be able to use any codeNcode I like, and do item access on any permutation codeS[i]code that I like.p  pIs it possible to get codeO1code item access on a permutation, given size codeNcode and permutation number codeicode If so, how p  pIf Im lucky enough to get code answers here, Id appreciate if theyll be in Python.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pSome people pointed out the sad fact that the permutation number itself would be so huge, that just reading the number would make the task nonfeasible. Then, Id like to revise my question strongGiven access to the a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiFactorialnumbersystemfactoradic representationa of a permutations lexicographic number, is it possible to get any item in the permutation in Oas small as possiblestrongp

Negative 21 pI have been trying to construct sql server 2008 reports that deliver records from a given table for multiple clients but does repeat the last few hours data for a given day. To explain I will select records for Client A from a table that provide the clients last user queries submitted to a search engine in the last hour. This report should not repeat the queries if the query did appear in a previous hours report. These records are kept for the day and then discarded. I was thinking that I need a second table to keep records of the last data I sent for a given client but not sure how to blend this all in  a report query. I was using SSBIDS but could not get the format of the report correct and now intend to create in manually.p  pso for examplep  precodeSELECT DISTINCT query FROM searchQueries  WHERE clientKey  client234567 AND DATEDIFFminute,CASTDATEADDED as datetime,GETDATElt60 AND NOT EXISTSSELECT DISTINCT query, clientKey FROM QUERYReport WHERE  DAYGETDATE    DAYDATEADDED   ..... codepre  pSo select the queries from table A for client A that was inserted within the last hour and do not appear in the table B for that client.

Negative 21 pIm trying to implement a nested comment system using redis, for example every article can have comments as first layer comments, then first layer comments can be commented and create second layer comments, and so on, can have infinite layers. Now im using hashs, each key represents an article, one field for article information and one field for comment, the value of comment is in xml format where tags are comment ids nested as child nodes. but its very inefficient because each i try to retrieve the comment, i have to get all of them as a whole.

Negative 21 pIm looking to connect two arrays together, sort of. I have two arrays, and want the elements of them to be sort of combined.p  pSo, lets say I have a scanner. It gives me a value for each element in array1 like US.

This is not less than 15, so wouldnt return anything.  However, putting 451 into my scanner returns 417. This is less than 418, so it would return this product is selling for cheapp  pstrongI hope this made sense.strongp

I am trying to read it into R using this codep  precodegtdataltread.tablefile.txt, headerTRUE,nrows100,sept  gtnamesltcolnamesdata  gtclassesltsapplydata[1,],class  gtdataltread.tablefile.txt,colClassesclasses,col.namesnames,headerTRUE,nrows460000,sept,fillTRUE codepre  pHowever when I use the septargument, R skips about half of the rows randomly, loading only 240000 rows, if I dont use the sept argument it loads all rows, but the columns are incorrect. it also gives a warning message stating that the number of columns in col.names doesnt match the number of headers in headerTRUEp  pI think the problem might be that in the .txt file, some fields are blank, these fields are just empty, so no spaces, NA or anything, for example p  blockquote   pfield1tfield2ttfield4t     field 3 is emptyp blockquote  pI got the file from a third party and am not in a position to make any chages to it.  Can anyone help me to fix this problemp  pThanks in advance,p  pTimp

Negative 21 pI have a left side nav with a main content area to the right of it. Regardless of if the left side nav or the content area has any content i would like it to stretch down to the bottom of the container. Basically this is what im trying to do a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24979374stretchingdivstobottomwitharesponsivegridStretching divs to bottom with a responsive grida. The answer in this thread does not work for me since the content is not expanding the div properly when reaching the bottom of the container.p  pWhat i have tried is to use height on html,body and parent of the container including the container and while that gives the correct height the height isnt automatically recalculated when the content reaches the bottom of the container the div isnt moving further down and the content is overflowing. In this situation i have used the overflow property which works but i dont want a scrollbar in a div, i would like it to expand naturally further down the page.p  pIve created a very simple html and css example to show the problemp  pHTMLp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodecss langcss prettyprintoverridecode    html,     body        height 100           .container        border 2px solid red       width 75       height 75       margin 0px auto          .content        border 2px solid yellow       display inlineblock       height 100       overflow auto       width 50          .rightmenu        border 2px solid green       display inlineblock       height 75       verticalalign top       width 15     codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt  ltheadgt   lttitlegttestinglttitlegt   ltlink relstylesheet hreftest.css typetextcssgt ltheadgt  ltbodygt   ltdiv classcontainergt     ltdiv classrightmenugt       ltpgttestltpgt       ltpgtthis is a testltpgt       ltpgtthis is a testltpgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classcontentgt       ltpgtthis is a testltpgt       ltpgtthis is a testltpgt       ltpgtthis is a testltpgt       ltpgtthis is another testltpgt       ltpgtthis is a testltpgt       ltpgtthis is a testltpgt       ltpgtthis is another testltpgt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt ltbodygt  lthtmlgtcodepre div div p  pI currently have the overflow property specified above but i dont want the scrollbars and i do not want to hide any content as i would like the content to be visible for users.

Negative 21 pI am learning by self process Trial and Error I was just curious before i started messing with the code and setting up the MySQL databases, Would it be possible to have a php script process variables from the URL and send them to the mysql database If so would this become a security breach for sql injection via the url At the moment in time my form on lets say page1.php has the inputs as shown below.. [timeofsurvey, datepicker, postcode] This currently sends them to page2.php using the var SendStrng and is sent in the url by GET method i assume. p  precodevar SendStrng  amptimeofsurvey timeofsurvey selected.val  ampdatepicker datepicker.val  ampPostcode Postcode.val  insuranceplus      alertSendStrng     window.location.href  httpMywebsite.comPage2.php SendStrng   codepre  pSo my question is would it be possible to have page2.php process these variables and send them to MySql database, the reason i say this is because when users visit the website the page2.php has more information regards to what is involved with the job ect ect.. i have found from statistics that some users are dropping on that page so not converting, i wanted the MySQL database to input these variables so we can still see what the client has entered so far before following the process through and exiting on page2.php However i did not know if it would be a big security issue using variables sent in the url due to sql injection.p  pSorry if this question is a silly one, i am still learning and Stack Overflow users have helped me a great deal so any further input  advice would be greatly appreciated p  pThanks.p

Negative 21 pI am experiencing some strange behaviour from my code which i am using to stream files to my clients.  I have a mssql server which acts as a filestore, with files that is accessed via an UNC path.p  pOn my webserver i have some .net code running that handles streaming the files in this case pictures and thumbnails to my clients. p  pMy code works, but i am experiencing a constant delay of 12 sec on the initial file request. When i have made the initial request it is as the server wakes up and suddenly becomes responsive only to fall back to the same behaviour some time after.p  pAt first i thought it was my code, but from what i can see on the server activity log there is no ressource intensive code going on. My theory is that at each call to the server the path must first be mounted and that is what causes the delay. It will then unmount some time after and will have to remount.p  pFor reference i am posting my code maybe i just cannot see the problemp  precodepublic async static Task StreamFileAsyncHttpContext context, FileInfo fileInfo          This controls how many bytes to read at a time and send to the client         int bytesToRead  512  1024  512KB           Buffer to read bytes in chunk size specified above         byte[] buffer  new Byte[bytesToRead]           Clear the current response contentheaders         context.Response.Clear         context.Response.ClearHeaders          Indicate the type of data being sent         context.Response.ContentType  FileTools.GetMimeTypefileInfo.Extension          Name the file         context.Response.AddHeaderContentDisposition, filename  fileInfo.Name           context.Response.AddHeaderContentLength, fileInfo.Length.ToString           Open the file         using var stream  fileInfo.OpenRead                       The number of bytes read             int length             do                               Verify that the client is connected                 if context.Response.IsClientConnected                                       Read data into the buffer                     length  await stream.ReadAsyncbuffer, 0, bytesToRead                       and write it out to the responses output stream                     await context.Response.OutputStream.WriteAsyncbuffer, 0, length                      try                                               Flush the data                         context.Response.Flush                                          catch HttpException                                               Cancel the download if a HttpException happens                          ie. the client has disconnected by we tried to send some data                         length  1                                           Clear the buffer                     buffer  new Byte[bytesToRead]                                  else                                       Cancel the download if client has disconnected                     length  1                               while length gt 0 Repeat until no data is read                    Tell the response not to send any more content to the client         context.Response.SuppressContent  true           Tell the application to skip to the EndRequest event in the HTTP pipeline         context.ApplicationInstance.CompleteRequest      codepre  pIf anyone could shed some light over this problem i would be very gratefulp

I was wondering if the process of changing the address of the files would be the most time consuming operation... because I have to do loops where I concatenate the foldersfiles numbers I want to access.

Negative 21 pI want to add a label, but I personally thing the default label is ugly. If you just dop  precodelth1gtExample heading ltspan classlabel labeldefaultgtNewltspangtlth1gt codepre  pThen the label looks huge, and the bottom of the label goes below the g in heading. Let me elaborate on what I mean by that, headin have the bottoms equal, then gs bottom is below that of a normal letter like y,j,etc and the bottom of the label goes even below that. If you still dont know what I mean look at the example on Bootstraps site. p  pAnyways what I want to do is have a smaller label, like the size you get with h3 for example, and have that labels top be aligned with the top of the text. Again let me explain, EAYlkt well not in Stackoverflows text have the same top like I was saying with headins bottom. So I want to have a smaller label thats inline with the top, kinda like a superscript, OR be aligned with the headin bottom. p  pI kinda get what I want with the followingp  precodelth1gtHeadinglth1gtlth3gtltspan classlabel labeldefaultgtNewltspangtlth3gt  in .css .jumbotron h1, h3      display inlineblock  codepre  pbut the bottom of label is aligned with the bottom of the g, which is the one way I dont want. If this was confusing give me a comment and Ill try to elaborate or send you a link, but hopefully I made my point. So what can I do to get my desired effect I apologize if this is trivial, but Ive only just started learning about making webpagesp

Negative 21 pIm trying to come to terms with the level of detail of a mipmapped texture in an OpenGL ES 2.0 fragment shader.p  pAccording to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma179173401468366this answera it is not possible to use the codebiascode parameter to codetexture2Dcode to access a specific level of detail in the fragment shader. According to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma73912411468366this posta the level of detail is instead automatically computed from the parallel execution of adjacent fragments. Ill have to trust that thats the way how things work.p  pWhat I cannot understand is the emwhyem of it. strongemWhyem isnt it possible to access a specific level of detail, when doing so should be very simple indeed emWhyem does one have to rely on complicated fixed functionality insteadstrongp  pTo me, this seems very counterintuitive. After all, the whole OpenGL related stuff evolves away from fixed functionality. And OpenGL ES is intended to cover a broader range of hardware than OpenGL, therefore only support the simpler versions of many things. So I would perfectly understand if developers of the specification had decided that the LOD parameter is mandatory perhaps defaulting to zero, and that its up to the shader programmer to work out the appropriate LOD, in whatever way he deems appropriate. Adding a function which does that computation automagically seems like something Id have expected in desktop OpenGL.p  pNot providing direct access to a specific level doesnt make any sense to me at all, no matter how I look at it. Particularly since that codebiascode parameter indicates that we are indeed allowed to tweak the level of detail, so apparently this is not about fetching data from memory only for a single level for a bunch of fragments processed in parallel. I cant think of any other reason.p  hr  pOf course, emwhyem questions tend to attract opinions. But since opinionbased answers are not accepted on Stack Overflow, please post your opinions as comments only. Answers, on the other hand, should be based on verifiable facts, like statements by someone with definite knowledge. If there are any records of the developers discussing this fact, that would be perfect. If there is a blog post by someone inside discussing this issue, that would still be very good.p  pSince Stack Overflow questions should deal with real programming problems, one might argue that asking for the reason is a bad question. Getting an answer wont make that explicit lod access suddenly appear, and therefore wont help me solve my immediate problems. But I feel that the reason here might be due to some important aspect of how OpenGL ES works which I havent grasped so far. If that is the case, then understanding the motivation behind this one decision will help me and others to better understand OpenGL ES as a whole, and therefore make better use of it in their programs, in terms of performance, exactness, portability and so on. Therefore I might have stated this question as what am I missing, which feels like a very real programming problem to me at the moment.p

This table also have one status field whose initial status is Received.

As the calling from the main method is sequential, the second webservice call can have just one entry in it whose status is Processed. After this, main method sleep for 5 second and process repeat infinitely. Also when I fetch this record I am changing the status to completed.p  pAlso the webservices is accessing DB remotely. The data also consist one requestIdThis is not primary key.p  pSo the problem is when this process continue for 1 hour I see there is some inconsistency in the requestId I send and receive.

Negative 21 pI would like to implement local authentication and authentication via social networks in a a hrefhttpsailsjs.org relnofollowSailsa app which is developed as an API server.p  pI tried passportjs and sailsauthgenerator but I think they are more meant towards sails apps which render server side views and requires extra logic if implemented in a restful app.p  pWith that I found the a hrefhttpsgithub.comsahatsatellizer relnofollowSatellizer auth modulea and would really like to use it over the passportjs mess.p  pIt also has very clean examples for authentication with different networks a hrefhttpsgithub.comsahatsatellizerblobmasterexamplesservernodeserver.js relnofollowAuth Examples for Expressjsa.p  pAlso, It has client side angularjs directives for plugnplay use.p  pBut, I am unable to figure out how should I port the whole ExpressJs example to sailsjs terminology of services, policies etc since this is new for me.

Negative 21 pI am working on a program that evolves creatures over time using a genetic algorithm. However, for some reason, my pygame display stopped working and I have absolutely no idea why. When I run the program, the window opens but then it just sits on a black screen. I have tested to see where the program gets to and about 38 creatures die then nothing happens. However, these creatures should be displaying before their deaths also, but they arent.Any help would be wonderful Thank you for all your timep  pHeres my codep  precodeimport numpy as np import

The data look as followsp  pbx02x04x04x12xb6x12xa5xe0xc1 This is the Output from printseread p  pFor clarification this answer is correct and must be read as followsp  px02   Address of the answering unit x04   Function that was executed Read from certain register area x04   Number of Bytes of the answer x12 xb6   Value of first register 2 Byte x12 xa5   Value of second register 2 Byte xe0 xc1   Checksum of answerp  pIf the data from the com port had all this Format i might be able to get the data values from the both Registers. But unfortunately the data format is not always the same.p  pSometimes i receive answers in the following stylep  pbx02x04x04x12x8ex12xe1Tp  pThe answer is similar to the example above different values in the Registers and different checksum but the Format i receive has changed.p  pIf i use the hex ASCII codes for the symbols obviously not hex values i find a valid answer telegram.p  pbx02x04x04x12x8ex12xe1T      p  pbecomesp  pbx02x04x04x12x8ex12x7bxe1x54 p  pwhen i Exchange the ASCII symbols by their hex code by Hand. p  pSo my questions arep  ol liIs it possible to force Python to give me the answer in a defined Formatli liIf not is it possible to handle the list or the string i can derive from the list in such a way that i get my values in the required formatli liDoes somebody can give me a hint how to extract my register values from the list and convert the two hex numbers of each register into one integer value for each register the first value is the high byte, the second the low byteli ol  pThanks in advance for your answersp  psincerelyp  pRolandp

Negative 21 pIm using codeTornadocodes a hrefhttptornado.readthedocs.orgenlatestguidesecurity.html relnofollowcodeSecure Cookiecodea functionality to implement user session. The codesetsecurecookiecode function enables us to create a Cookie where lower limit for cookie expiry can be set to 1 day. Now, I need to expire these secure cookies in one hour. Can I achieve this easilyp  pOne solution is to append a timestamp with the cookie value. For example, if the cookie value is my users ID e.g. code1code, then I can create a cookie like code1current datetimecode. When validating later, I can split the cookie value and check if the datetime after the codeunderscore charactercode is not less than 1 hour before current time. This sounds acceptable to me as Tornados Secure Cookies can not be modified by the user.p  pHowever, are there any elegant solution than thisp

Negative 21 pThe goal is to create a system in PHP that lets a user submit a string, applies a javascript function to that string, then returns the value of the string after it is processed by the javascript function.

Negative 21 pI need to call a webservice URI from an Excel cell. I know this can be done using the inbuilt WEBSERVICE function.

This is not what I am looking for though.p  pAny help or suggestion would be appreciated. Thanks in advancep

Negative 21 pIm trying to set up a seekbar to control the level of an instance of exoplayer streaming dash.p  pThe setup I am using is a modified version of the demo project and am having trouble figuring out which element I should be trying to affect with the seekbars output ie how to use MSGSETVOLUME properly etc etc  Any input would be massively appreciated.p  pThe end result I am looking for is an application with two instances of exoplayer both streaming dash content with a faderseekbar controlling the mix of the two players which once this is figured out i presume should be easy enough if the maths is correct Again any help would be massively appreciated I have had a bit of a time with Exoplayer so far being such a novice thanks guysp

Negative 21 pIm running a ruby on Rails app with a PostgreSQL backend, and am wondering what the standard way is to store a series of timestamps. The situation is that I have a model with a boolean codestatuscode attribute. I need to keep track of the datestimes at which this attribute changes, because I need to keep track of the time periods during which codestatuscode is set to codetruecode. My experience with this kind of problem is seriously lacking, and Im not sure what the best practice is for doing this kind of thing in a scalable way. The two approaches Ive considered are p  p1 JSONifying text. I was thinking about taking an array that might look like the followingp  precode[           start 20150131103045,       end 20150228103045   ,           start 20150531103045,       end 20150628103045   , ] codepre  pI would then JSONify this array and store it in a codetextcode column.p  p2 Creating a separate table which would have columns of codemodelidcode, codestatuscode, and codetimerecordedcode attributes, and then simply creating an entry every time the models codestatuscode attribute is updated.p  pWhich of these approaches is more sound Something to consider here is that this data is probably not going to be read very frequently  95 of the time, it will just be new data that gets written to the database. p  pOption 1 seems to be less heavyhanded to me, but it would also be a bigger pain to read the data and sort through it when I need to. Option 2 would store that data in a way thats easier to work with, and the preexisting data would never need to be readupdated, but the table could potentially get very large, very quickly. The kicker is that I have to do this with several models in my app, so making hasty decision and implementing a bad architecture from the start could be rather annoying to deal with later.p  pWhat are the pros and cons of these two approaches Is either of these obviously a better solution than the other Or is there another, better option that I havent thought ofp

Negative 21 pI have an iOS 8 app that uses MapKit. I recently discovered a performance problem with the app when running a video decompression in addition to displaying a map. The app was unable to keep up with the flow of incoming data when using the satellite view tile set. However, this problem vanished the moment I swapped to the default MapKit tile set. The app is not CPU bottlenecked when the problem is occurring. It makes sense to me that the default vector map tile set is easier to display, but I am confused about why the issue is happening in the first place.p  pThe problem seems strange to me because there is no movement or manipulation of the map when the problem is occurring. I would understand the issue better if it happened when manipulating the map in addition to rendering video to the screen, but the problem exists even with no user input. I am constrained in analyzing the system because we use a hardware accessory, so some Instruments are not available over wireless performance analysis. I am not using a high number of annotations, overlays, or other objects. We have a few custom annotations and overlays in use. There are existing apps that do this exact combination of decoding and maps, without the performance problem, so I suspect its a configuration issue.p  pAre there certain attributes on the MKMapView that I can set to improve performance I am at a loss as to what to investigate further since I cannot make the problem happen with the GPU Instrument active and the CPU doesnt appear to be the constraint.p

Negative 21 pI am trying the plot data in real time with 30 frames per second in C WPF with some framework, such as DevExpress, ComponentOne and Visifire. My approach is as followp  pA standalone thread is maintained to append data to the plot. Everytime the length of the plot is checked. If the length of the plot is equal to 50 samples, then the first sample is dropped and a new sample is appended. Therefore, the length of the plot is maintained as 50 samples.p  pNow I would like to refresh the plot for 30 times per second. However, none of three frameworks can achieve this refresh rate. May I ask if any one have sample code to achieve this goalp  pThank you.p
