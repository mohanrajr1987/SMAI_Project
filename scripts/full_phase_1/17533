Positive 17533 pI have implemented an NSSplitView which essentially keeps a table on the left of the window like a sidebar, and a webView on the right. The user clicks the different rows of the table to load a url in the WebView.p  pMy issue is that when I run the app, the divider moves to the right edge of the width of the left view and the window size does not increase to accomodate the webView. At first I thought the webView was just not working, until I discovered I was able to drag the divider to the left which revealed the webView.p  pIts my understanding that the auto layout constraints setup within the view itself is how the split view resizes, however I create the webView programatically via a subclassed view controller rather than on a storyboard or xib. As a test, I tried placing a button and applying width constraints but it had no affect, the webView is still hidden, essentially with a width of 0 points and is only able to be revealed by dragging the split view divider to the left.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions how I can go about resolving this issuep  pThanks in advancep
Positive 17533 pIm trying to swipe two DataGrids to the leftright when clicking on an entry in the DataGrida button. When clicking on an entry in the first DataGrid, the grid should move to the left and outside of the Window out of sight. From the right then comes the second DataGridanother container. Now this container is visible. When clicking on a button, the two objects DataGrid and container should move to the right.

Positive 17533 pI have the need to show a different view controller for compact vs regular size classes. The difference in views is too great for the regular use case. My app used to just work based off of iPad Storyboard vs iPhone Storyboard. On an iPhone it shows some text, and on an iPad it shows a PDF. Would I have to do this in code, by creating a different container view controller, or are Size Classes not the tool for thisp

Positive 17533 pWhen the device is in portrait orientation I have tableView and graphView in a viewController. When i change to landscape mode, i want to display only graphView. I am using size classes to do it. It works for all iPhones. p  pBut for iPad, Size classes for portrait and landscape are same regular width and height. p  pI need to set different constraints for portrait and landscape mode.How do i remove tableView when the device is in landscape.p
Positive 17533 pSo I want to have an image that displays on the bottom half of my screen and then animate it to a smaller scale and have it attached to the topright.  Sorry for the crude images, but this is basically what I wantp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comZ3ojL.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZ3ojL.png altOriginal Placementa a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comgTBgX.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgTBgX.png altFinal Placementap  pI thought I could do this by constraining the top, right, and aspect ratio of my view then just animate the change of my aspect ratio constraint.  Unfortunately, when I do this IB screams that I dont have a proper X value for my view, and when I animate the scale I just end up with my view shrunk vertically but still full width.p  pI hope this makes sense and someone can help me figure out how to make this happen.p

Positive 17533 pI need to preprocess my launch storyboard file to change its background color based on same build time configuration. Ive added the following rule under Xcode Build Rulesp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comayNPb.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comayNPb.png altbuild rule screenshotap  pBut Im having some problems getting this to work. Actual script is fine.p  pFirst, the rule is not being executed. I guess if fails to match the file name. When I specify to match code.storyboardcode, it gets executed, but I do not want it matching all storyboard files, just that one. Of course, I could check the file name in the script itself.p  pSecondly, when it gets executed, it does not cause any side effects. I guess that the rules that follow, more specifically Storyboard compiler, fail to pick this file up. It might be that Im using wrong file paths, or that my change is being overwritten with original file sometime later in the build process. Does anyone have more experience in thisp

Positive 17533 pSo I have an application that builds the UI from a storyboard, and I have this ViewController that needs to render both a UITableView and UICollectionView within the same scene. p  pSo I basically created a regular UIViewController that that contains both a UITableView and a UICollectionView. The views are obviously set within the storyboard.

Trying to find out why this imageview or textview is giving errors.p  pstrongEdit 3strong emnot applicable anymoreem The view in question has 4 images and 4 textviews in a grid, it seems that the images press away the textviews, and when this happens, the view does not load. perhaps some constraints cannot be resolved..p  pstrongEdit 4strong The view looks like this I cannot post screenshot due to NDAp  precodeImage                         Image Textview                     Textview  Image                         Image Textview                     Textview   codepre  pIf we use for all Textviews the same text, it works, if however we change the upright Textview strongshorterstrong text, it stucks and does not load.. Is this a bug I am really lost.. I repeated the same experiment 3 times, and each time I set the text to the short variant it does not work, for the a bit longer text value it does work..p  hr  pstrongEdit 5, problem text cannot be too smallstrongp  pWhen we set the text of one of the four TextViews to a string that is smaller than ten characters, the view does not load. If we use strings that are bigger than ten characters any string, the view loads.p  pThis is a very very weird bug, we are now trying to change the bounding box sizes of the textviews, to see if it has something to do with that.p  pWith a string of 9 characters, the view refuses to load. With 10 characters it loads fine, no problem at all. There are no constraint issues whatshowever.p  pWhen we use spaces to make it at least 10 characters, everything works fine... This is definately a bug..p
Positive 17533 pI have a two text boxs one purely for animation and another to use. The animation works fine apart from when the text box is not focused i would like it to reverse the animation, which is possible if you use exit actions, but this then does not allow me to use the text box underneath as it sees that as an exit action. So i wondered if it was possible to only reverse the animation when the grid is pressed or even exclude the other text box p  phow can i achieve this Here is my code. p  precode ltTextBlock

Negative 17533 pIve always wondered why the C Standard library has instantiated basic[io]stream and all its variants using the codecharcode type instead of the codeunsigned charcode type. codecharcode means depending on whether it is signed or not you can have overflow and underflow for operations like get, which will lead to implementationdefined value of the variables involved. Another example is when you want to output a byte, unformatted, to an ostream using its codeputcode function.p  pAny ideasp  phr p  pstrongNotestrong Im still not really convinced.

Negative 17533 pIm quickly falling in love with ASP.NET MVC beta, and one of the things Ive decided I wont sacrifice in deploying to my IIS 6 hosting environment is the extensionless URL. Therefore, Im weighing the consideration of adding a wildcard mapping, but everything I read suggests a potential performance hit when using this method. However, I cant find any actual benchmarks p  pThe first part of this question is, do you know where I might find such benchmarks, or is it just an untested assumptionp  pThe second part of the question is in regards to the 2 load tests I ran using jMeter on our dev server over a 100Mbs connection. p  pstrongBackground Infostrongp  pOur hosting provider has a 4Gbs burstable internet pipe with a 1Gbs backbone for our VLAN, so anything I can produce over the office lan should translate well to the hosting environment. p  pThe test scenario was to load several images  css files, since the supposed performance hit comes when requesting files that are now being passed through the ASP.NET ISAPI filter that would not normally pass through it. Each test contained 50 threads simulated users running the request script for 1000 iterations each. The results for each test are posted below.p  pstrongTest Resultsstrongp  pWithout wildcard mappingp  pre Samples 50,000 Average response time 428ms Number of errors 0 Requests per second 110.1 Kilobytes per second 11,543 pre  pWith wildcard mappingp  pre Samples 50,000 Average response time 429ms Number of errors 0 Requests per second 109.9 Kilobytes per second 11,534 pre  pBoth tests were run warm everything was in memory, no initial load bias, and from my perspective, performance was about even. CPU usage was approximately 60 for the duration of both tests, memory was fine, and network utilization held steady around 9095.p  pIs this sufficient proof that wildcard mappings that pass through the ASP.NET filter for ALL content dont emreallyem affect performance, or am I missing somethingp  pEdit 11 hours and not a single comment I was hoping for more.. lolp

Therefore, if I call WaitCommEvent inside a function and then leave the function, the overlapped structure cannot be a local variable, right The event mask variable and event handle too, rightp  p2 ReadFile and WriteFile also take references or pointers to variables. Therefore all these variables have to be accessible until the overlapped read or write operations finish, rightp  p3 I call WaitCommEvent only once and check for its result in a loop, in the mean time doing other things. Because I have no idea how to terminate asynchronous operations is it possible, when I destroy my class that keeps a handle to a serial port, I first close the handle, and then wait for the event in the overlapped structure that was used when calling the WaitCommEvent function. I do this to be sure that the thread that waits asynchronously for a comm event does not access any fields of my class which is destroyed. Is it a good idea or is it stupidp  precodetry   CloseHandleFSerialPortHandle   if AssignedFWaitCommEvent then     FWaitCommEvent.WaitForINFINITE       finally   FSerialPortHandle  INVALIDHANDLEVALUE   FreeAndNilFWaitCommEvent end codepre  pBefore I noticed all these, most of the variables mentioned in point one and two were local variables of the functions that called the three methods above. Could it be the reason of the BSOD or should I look for some other mistakes in my codep  pWhen I corrected the code, the BSOD stopped occuring, but It might be a coincidence. How do you thinkp  pAny ideas will be appreciated. Thanks in advance.p  hr  pI read the CancelIo function documentation and it states that this method cancells all IO operations issued by the calling thread. Is it OK to wait for the FWaitCommEvent after calling CancelIo if I know that WaitCommEvent was issued by a different thread than the one that calls CancelIop  precode  if AssignedFWaitCommEvent and CancelIoFSerialPortHandle then   begin     FWaitCommEvent.WaitForINFINITE     FreeAndNilFWaitCommEvent   end codepre  pI checked what happens in such case and the thread calling this piece of code didnt get deadlocked even though it did not issue WaitCommEvent. I tested in on Windows 7 if it matters. May I leave the code as is or is it dangerous Maybe I misunderstood the documentation and this is the reason of my question. I apologize for asking so many questions, but I really need to be sure about that.p  pThanks.p
Negative 17533 pSay weve got requirements for all the functionality we want to build. Each requirement is listed in a Word doc with an associated ID. For instance, Requirement 123 is each refund, if processed the same business day as the last payment, should be processed as a cancellation and will incur no refund processing fee.p  pWhat Id like is for the code itself to be marked up with requirement ID somehow, so that each code unit has a corresponding requirement its built to support, and we can tell at a glance if all the requirements have been implemented. Automated testing can even associate a test with each requirement and check off a list of them if unit testing has passed.p  pIt would open up a lot of automation opportunities, tying our issue tracking, documentation and actual code together.p  pSo whats wrong with this idea If its a good one, are code attributes or XML comments the best way to implement it Has someone else already made a commercial or FOSS product that does this Any other thoughtsp  pstrongEDITstrong The mapping need not be onetoone. I would be fine with multicasting attributes, so that each code unit is decorated with multiple Requirement attributes, and each Requirement attribute could be found on multiple code units.p
Negative 17533 pI have nested groupboxes, which logically represent nested data structures in my application.

I want the mechanism to work like this When i check CDev2, ICDev1 amp ICDev2 get automatically checked. But when I uncheck ICDev1, CDev2 stays in its own state. Basically, i want these events to be propagated to children but not to parent, like one way binding. p  pI am using .Net 2.0 SP2. I dont know if this is possible or not, therefore i would be glad if you show me some pointers about this. If its not possible, i am going to implement event handlers for all checkboxes.p

Negative 17533 pi will be short.p  pAs far as i know watir library provides two methods for getting html elements.p  pAlmost for each element div, button, table, li, etc watir provides two methodsp  p. One is the singular method which gets only one specific element. For examplep  precodewatirinstance.divid,mydivid watirinstance.linkhref,mylinkhref watirinstance.buttonclass gtmybuttonclass, index gt 4 codepre  pThese methods will only retrieve A SINGLE ELEMENT. Thats ok...p  p. The second is the plural method that will retrieve ALL the elements of the watir instancep  precodewatirinstance.divs watirinstance.links watirinstance.buttons codepre  pBut as far as i know watir doesnt provide a method to get more than one element giving certain conditions.p  pFor example... If i want to flash all the links with idmylinkid it would be very easy to do something like thisp  precodewatirinstance.divsid, mylinkid.each do link   link.flash end codepre  pWith hpricot this task is very easy... but if your aim is not to parse i couldnt find a Watir Method that does what i want.p  pHope you can understand me...p  pCheers, Juanp

Negative 17533 pI recently switched from using Vim in Puttytray on WindowsXP to Komodo on OSX.  One of the features I miss is Puttytray used to let you copy the colored text out of whatever is in your terminal and paste it as rich text on any application that accepts it like your instant messanger. This makes it easier for me to discuss code with coworkers.p  pIs it possible to do similar with Komodop

Negative 17533 pIve written a small script in Python that pings all subnets of my schools wireless network and prints out the IP addresses and hostnames of computers that are connected to each subnet of the network.

What that means is that suppose I have the following subnet 128.119.177.024 and the first available host is 128.119.177.20. I want my script to stop pinging the remaining hosts in the 128.119.177.024 after I successfully contact 128.119.177.20. I want to repeat that for every subnet on my network 128.119.0.1  128.119.255.254. Given my current setup, what would be the best course of action to make this change I was thinking of doing something like a list of Queues where each Queue holds 255 IP addresses for one of the subnets and having one thread process each queue unless there is a limitation on how many threads I can spawn in Python on Windows.p  pEDIT I have played around with nmap and Angry IP scanner for this task, but I was interested in pursuing writing my own script. p

Negative 17533 pI am not able to understand the point of codeOption[T]code class in Scala.

Negative 17533 pWere building an application that handles image uploads. I want users to be able to upload an image at a given size, say 128x128, and then have the server automatically generate other sizes based on that, such as 64x64, 57x57, and 25x25.p  pAre there libraries that can help me with thisp  pEdit I should note that the resizing should take place only on upload. When the new image sizes are rendered in the browser, it should be pulling from cached copies  not doing the resizing again. In other words, the different sizes should be generated only once, not each time the images are requested.p

Negative 17533 pIve almost finished writing a HTTP1.0 compliant web server under Java no commercial usage as such, this is just for fun and basically I want to include PHP support. I realize that this is no easy task at all, but I think itll be a nice accomplishment.p  pSo I want to know how PHP exactly interfaces with the Apache web server or any other web server really, so I can learn from it and write my own PHP wrapper. It doesnt necessarily have to be modphp, I dont mind writing a FastCGI wrapper  which to my knowledge is capable of running PHP as well.p  pI wouldve thought that all that PHP needs is the output that goes to client so it can interpret the PHP parts, the full HTTP request from client so it can extract POST variables and such and the clients host name. And then you simply take the parsed PHP code and write that to the output stream. There will probably be more things, but in essence thats how I would have thought it works.p  pFrom what Ive gathered so far, apache2handler provides an API which PHP makes use of to connect to Apache. I guess its an idea to look at the source code for apache2handler and php5apache2.dll or so, but before I do that I thought Id ask SO first.p  pIf anyone has more information, experience, or some sort of specification that is relevant to this then please let me know.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 17533 pOk, so heres my problem.  We are looking at purchasing a data set from a company to augment our existing data set.  For the purposes of this question, lets say that this data set ranks places with an organic number meaning that the number assigned to one place has no bearing on the number assigned to another.  The technical range is 0 to infinity, but from sample sets that Ive seen, its 0 to 70.  Based on the sample, its most definitely not a uniform distribution out of 10,000 there are maybe 5 places with a score over 40, 50 with a score over 10, and 1000 with a score over 1.  Before we decide to purchase this set, we would like to simulate it so that we can see how useful it may be.p  pSo, to simulate it, Ive been thinking about generating a random number for each place about 150,000 random numbers.  But, I also want to keep to the spirit of the data, and keep the distribution relatively the same or at least reasonably close.  Ive been racking my brain all day trying to think of a way to do it, and have come up empty.p  pOne thought I had was to square the random number between 0 and sqrt70.  But that would favor both less than 1 and larger numbers.  p  pIm thinking that he real distribution should be hyperbolic in the first quadrant...  Im just blanking on how to turn a linear, even distribution of random numbers into a hyperbolic distribution If hyperbolic is even what I want in the first place.p  pAny thoughtsp  pSo, to sum, heres the distribution I would like approximatelyp  ul li40  70 0.02  0.05li li10  40 0.5  1li li1  10 10  20li li0  1  Remainder 78.95  89.48li ul

Negative 17533 pIm using the standard autocomplete plugin a hrefhttpdocs.jquery.comPluginsAutocomplete relnofollowherea.p  pI have two text boxes on my form, item name and item id. The idea is that I want the user to search for the item by name, but on form submit I actually need the item id.p  pI am returning json from an ASP.NET MVC action which is used in the autocomplete.p  pThe user starts typing an item name, the autocomplete list appears and is formatted to show the item name from the json object. The user can then click on a name from the list and the item id will be populated in the other textbox which will actually be a hidden field once everything is working. I can then check that there is a value in this second textbox before submitting the form.p  pIn the above scenario everything works great. But there are two huge bugs in what Ive got so farp  p1 The user has to actually click on the item in the list for the coderesultcode function to fire. So if there is an item strongapplesstrong, and the user simply types strongapplesstrong directly into the textbox, the item id doesnt get populated.p  p2 The user could select strongapplesstrong from the list, which populates the item id. The user then changes his mind and goes back to the text box and types strongorangesstrong. Again, if he doesnt actually click on the item in the list, the item id doesnt change and now when the form is submitted the wrong item id is submitted. Same thing if the user types something which isnt a valid selection, for example he changes the textbox to strongapplesblahblahblahstrong, the item id of strongapplesstrong is still going to be submitted even though a valid item choice wasnt made.p  pIve seen examples which suggest this can be solved by firing the codesearchcode event, but Ive tried that and it doesnt really seem to do much.p  pDoes anyone know how to solve this problemp  pMy code so far is below, its all pretty standard at the moment...p  precodeItemSearch.autocompleteMyActionFindItems,      dataType json,     parse functiondata          var parsed  []         for var i  0 i lt data.length i              parsed[parsed.length]                   data data[i],                 value data[i].Value,                 result data[i].Key                               return parsed     ,     formatItem functionrow          return row.Value      .resultfunctionevent, data, formatted      this.valdata.Value     ItemId.valdata.Key .blurfunction       this is where I was trying to force an update of the item id textbox,       but it doesnt work.     this.search  codepre  pId be greatful for any pointers.

It seems ridiculous to sit there for 45 minutes adding 300 solutions click by click. There must be a way to create an NDepend project file from a list of the paths to these solution  project files.p  pMy first thought was to find the same information NDepends does output directories, used namespaces and output executables dlls, etc and programmatically create the NDepend project as a massive string. However, this seems like unnecessary work.p  pIt would be nice if there was a way to invoke the command line and target specific projects, not output directories, as some of the projects have PostBuild tasks to copy assemblies to different directories, some projects specify the output directory as an upward relative path ie ...., and so it isnt safe to assume that the output directory of a project is the same directory it is in.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 17533 pIm wondering if anyones run across anything that exists which would fill this need.p  pObject A contains an object B.  It wants to provide access to that B to clients through a pointer maybe theres the option it could be 0, or maybe the clients need to be copiable and yet hold references...whatever.  Clients, lets call them object C, would normally, if were perfect developers, be written carefully so as to not violate the lifetime semantics of any pointer to B they might have...but were not perfect, in fact were pretty dumb half the time.p  pSo what we want is for object C to have a pointer to object B that is not shared ownership but that is smart enough to recognize a situation in which the pointer is no longer valid, such as when object A is destroyed or it destroys object B.  Accessing this pointer when its no longer valid would cause an assertionexceptionwhatever.p  pIn other words, I wish to share access to data in a safe, clear way but retain the original ownership semantics.  Currently, because Ive not been able to find any shared pointer in which one of the objects owns it, Ive been using sharedptr in place of having such a thing.  But I want clear owneship and sharedweak pointer doesnt really provide that.p  pWould be nice further if this smart pointer could be attached to member variables and not just hold pointers to dynamically allocated memory regions.p  pIf it doesnt exist Im going to make it, so I first want to know if someones already released something out there that does it.p  pAnd, BTW, I do realize that things like references and pointers do provide this sort of thing...Im looking for something smarter.p

Negative 17533 pIm going through the tutorials for android and something about intentactivity interaction is confusing me. In Javascript whenever there is an ajax call we define how the results should be handled along with the ajax call and we can use different callbacks for different ajax calls throughout the application lifecycle. In android starting an activity with an intent and handling the passed back results are decoupled, at least thats how its done in the tutorial and there is only a single point of entry for how the results are handled so its hard to perform on the fly handling of results without messing with the main entry point. I can easily imagine some complex logic that could make the switching inside the main entry point into a horrible mess. Is this a fundamental android architectural thing or is there another way to do things with actual callbacks instead of switch statements in a single entry pointp

Negative 17533 pI am working on a .NET 4 MVC 3 application.  Im trying to follow a domain driven design paradigm.  Right now, my application is broken into two pieces, a domain and my MVC code for the web.  Id like some help in determining where in this structure I should consume a RESTful web service.p  pThis specific project uses a RESTful web service to retrieve and persist data.  In my domain, I have two entities Customer and User which pair up with web services of the same name.  e.g. URLCustomer and URLUser.  Each web services takes a few parameters and then returns an appropriate list of data in XML.  I need to implement basic CRUD functionality in the form of POST, GET, PUT and DELETE.  Given this, I have two main questions.p  p1.  What type of object should I create to consume these web services  My gut instinct is to create an ICustomerService interface that defines my CRUD operations, and then create an implementation of that interface in the form of a class that uses HTTPWebConnection or extends it.  Is there a better way to consume RESTful web services  Should this type of class be staticp  p2.  Where should this service code go  Again, my gut tells me that in addition to the Domain and WebUI sections of my code, I need a third, Services section that contains the interfaces and implementations of these web service clients, but since the web services are returning XML representations of the Customer and User entities that are in my domain, the services wont really be decoupled from the domain.p  pThanks in advance, Gregp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAfter working on various projects for some time, Ive found a good way of handling REST web services in MVC.p  pFirstly, I create Entities that represent the various web services that I will be using.

It arise while I was writing a QWidget where I was going to create the VideoWidget with its components... I checked other Phonon classes, and the GUI is not affected when they are initialized. Egp  precodePhononMediaObject mediaObject  new PhononMediaObjectthis codepre  pI have also tried to reproduce the problem with a simpler GUI, and it compiles and works with no problem, so there should be something that is in conflict with Phonon. I thought it could be the GLWidget, but I disconnected this part of the GUI... and it still kills the threads. p  pHas somebody run into a similar problem Has somebody any insight of what could be going wrong or how to check the thread killsp

The idea is to find out the different in width p1s item  p2s item between ItemProcess P1 and P2 according to the same ItemID, same ItemNo and same ItemLocation. I have around 75000 and it took more then 25 minute to get the width differences for all the ItemId.p  pI tried to use Group by for the width different calculation but it would return multiple row instead of just a value which then would return error. By the way I am use MS SQL server 2008 and tempcalctbl is a table that I declared in a store procedure.p

Negative 17533 pSorry for the following long winded question.  It is long because I have included all my findings from debugging the problem.p  pI am confused about what is going on here, I have spent some time trying to debug this, but cant seem to figure out what the problem isp  pI have 2 functions which run on codepage loadcode, codegetTabMenucode and codegetTabFramecode, the code for these can be seen right at the end of this question.  p  pThese all work fine on codepage loadcode.p  pHowever, after the codepage loadcode, if I run those functions again codeajax stylecode without refreshing the browser, i.e. via a codeclick eventcode after inserting a record into the database, meaning the functions above will get a little extra codehtmlcode and codeJSONcode data. For some reason it keeps opening the first tab page content when the newly created tab is clicked, instead of the tab content it should open even though all the ids seem to be assigned correctly.  As soon as I coderefreshcode the page via the browser refresh button, it will then start working properly...p  pHere are some of the codehtmlcode and codejsoncode outputs I have captured during my debuggingp  pon page loadp  pcodegetTabFramecode generatesp  precode[              key 4,         value Internal     ,              key 5,         value External     ,              key 6,         value Reporting     ,              key 7,         value General interest      ] codepre  pcodegetTabMenucode generatesp  precodeltdiv classitem idtab0gtInternalltdivgt ltdiv classitem idtab1gtExternalltdivgt ltdiv classitem idtab2gtReportingltdivgt ltdiv classitem idtab3gtGeneral interestltdivgt codepre  pAll looks good as this happens on codepage loadcode and it all works correctly.p  pAfter inserting a new row in the database and rerunning the above functions without refreshing the browser I getp  pcodegetTabFramecode generatesp  precode[              key 4,         value Internal     ,              key 5,         value External     ,              key 6,         value Reporting     ,              key 7,         value General interest     ,              key 38,         value Other      ] codepre  pcodeGetTabMenucode generatesp  precodeltdiv classitem idtab0gtInternalltdivgt ltdiv classitem idtab1gtExternalltdivgt ltdiv classitem idtab2gtReportingltdivgt ltdiv classitem idtab3gtGeneral interestltdivgt ltdiv classitem idtab4gtOtherltdivgt codepre  pAgain everything looks good, note the extra data in the codehtmlcode and codejsoncode snippets.p  pNow for the problem, when I now codeclickcode on codetab4code, it sends off the key code4code to the codegettabcontent.aspxcode via url query string, it should be sending off the key code38code.  So because it sends off the key code4code, it gets the same page as if I clicked on codetab0code, which sends of key code4code.  Clicking on any of the older tabs, return the correct pages, its just the newly created tab which is causing a problem.p  pSo now, if I refresh the browser, I get the following on codepage loadcodep  pcodegetTabFramecode generatesp  precode[              key 4,         value Internal     ,              key 5,         value External     ,              key 6,         value Reporting     ,              key 7,         value General interest     ,              key 38,         value Other      ] codepre  pcodegetTabMenucode generatesp  precodeltdiv classitem idtab0gtInternalltdivgt ltdiv classitem idtab1gtExternalltdivgt ltdiv classitem idtab2gtReportingltdivgt ltdiv classitem idtab3gtGeneral interestltdivgt ltdiv classitem idtab4gtOtherltdivgt codepre  pNote, this looks exactly the same as the output returned from when the button was clicked without refreshing the browser, which is correct.p  pNow if I click on codetab4code, it sends off code38code, this is correct, and which intern returns the correct page content...  p  pSo basically, rerunning the functions generates the correct html and json, but the newly created data which was not present on page load does not work properly until the browser is refreshed.p  pWhy is this happeningp  pHere is the codegetTabMenucode functionp  precodefunction getTabMenu      .ajax         url gettabmenu.aspxrand  Math.random,         type GET,         error functionxhr, status, error                      console.logstatus             console.logxhr.responseText         ,         success functionresults                        div1.empty.appendresults                codepre  pand here is the codegetTabFramecode functionp  precodefunction getTabFrame      .ajax         url gettabframe.aspxrand  Math.random,         type GET,         dataType json,         error functionxhr, status, error              alertError   status  nError Text   error  nResponse Text   xhr.responseText         ,         success functionresults              var tabs  tabs              .eachresults, functionindex, item                  tabs.tabsadd,gettabcontent.aspxtab  item.key, item.value                     .findgtulgtlilast                     .attrid, tab  item.key                  alertitem.key                   new click events                 tab  index  .liveclick, function  tabs.tabs select , index                             getTabMenu                codepre

Negative 17533 pIm studying the behavior of the C linker with respect to template specializations. Im using Microsoft Visual C 2010 for these experiments. I dont know if the behavior is the same with other toolchains e.g. gcc.p  pHeres a first code snippetp  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecode bar.cpp  template lttypename Tgt int foo  return 1  int bar  return fooltdoublegt    main.cpp  template lttypename Tgt int foo  return 1  template ltgt int fooltdoublegt  return 2   int bar  int main      const int x  bar     const int y  fooltdoublegt   doesnt link  codepre  pExpectedly, this code doesnt link because codefooltdoublegtcode has multiple definitions as it gets instantiated once in embar.cppem and once in emmain.cppem via specialization. We would then expect, emif this program would linkem, that codebarcode and codemaincode would use distinct instantiations of codefoocode such that at the end we would have xnbspnbsp1 and ynbspnbsp2.p  pLets fix the link error by declaring the specialization of codefooltdoublegtcode as codestaticcodep  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecode bar.cpp  template lttypename Tgt int foo  return 1  int bar  return fooltdoublegt    main.cpp  template lttypename Tgt int foo  return 1  template ltgt static int fooltdoublegt  return 2    note static  int bar  int main      const int x  bar           x  1     const int y  fooltdoublegt   y  2  codepre  pWe now have xnbspnbsp1 and ynbspnbsp2, as we expected. Note we emmustem use the codestaticcode keyword here an anonymous namespace wont do since we cant specialize a template function in a different namespace than its declaration.p  pNow, the use of the codestaticcode keyword is rather unintuitive. Typically, the specialization  codefooltdoublegtcode would reside somewhere in a header file, and thus would be marked as inline, like in the following snippetp  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecode bar.cpp  template lttypename Tgt int foo  return 1  int bar  return fooltdoublegt    main.cpp  template lttypename Tgt int foo  return 1  template ltgt inline int fooltdoublegt  return 2    note inline  int bar  int main      const int x  bar           x  2     const int y  fooltdoublegt   y  2  codepre  pThis code now links properly and when we run it we get xnbspnbsp2 and ynbspnbsp2. strongThis is the bit I find surprising why is there a single definition of codefooltdoublegtcode What is the meaning of codeinlinecode in this codestrongp  pA last snippetp  pre classlangcpp prettyprintoverridecode bar.cpp  template lttypename Tgt int foo  return 1  int bar  return fooltdoublegt    main.cpp  template lttypename Tgt int foo  return 1  template ltgt inline int fooltdoublegt  return 2    note inline  int bar  int main      const int x  bar              x  1      const int y  fooltdoublegt   note commented out  codepre  pThis case is actually not surprising the  specialization of codefooltdoublegtcode is no longer instantiated in emmain.cppem although the declaration is still there, so the only instantiation remaining is the one in embar.cppem.p

Negative 17533 pI recently read this article from Neil Griffin a hrefhttpjava.dzone.comarticlesmakingdistinctionsbetweenMaking Distinctions Between Different Kinds of JSF ManagedBeansa and it got me thinking about the distinction between different beans in my own application. To quickly summarise the gistp  blockquote   ul   lipModel ManagedBean This type of managedbean participates in the   Model concern of the MVC design pattern. When you see the word   model  think DATA. A JSF modelbean should be a POJO that follows   the JavaBean design pattern with getterssetters encapsulating   properties.pli   lipBacking ManagedBean This type of managedbean participates in the   View concern of the MVC design pattern. The purpose of a   backingbean is to support UI logic, and has a 11 relationship with   a JSF view, or a JSF form in a Facelet composition. Although it   typically has JavaBeanstyle properties with associated   getterssetters, these are properties of the View  not of the   underlying application data model. JSF backingbeans may also have JSF   actionListener and valueChangeListener methods.pli   lipController ManagedBean This type of managedbean participates in   the Controller concern of the MVC design pattern. The purpose of a   controller bean is to execute some kind of business logic and return a   navigation outcome to the JSF navigationhandler. JSF controllerbeans   typically have JSF action methods and not actionListener methods.pli   lipSupport ManagedBean This type of bean supports one or more views   in the View concern of the MVC design pattern. The typical use case   is supplying an ArrayList to JSF hselectOneMenu dropdown   lists that appear in more than one JSF view. If the data in the   dropdown lists is particular to the user, then the bean would be kept   in session scope.pli   lipUtility ManagedBean This type of bean provides some type of   utility function to one or more JSF views. A good example of this   might be a FileUpload bean that can be reused in multiple web   applications.pli   ul blockquote  pThis made sense to me and for the past few hours I have been refactoring my code and came up with the following with respect to the user loginp  pThe codeAuthenticationControllercode is an example of a Controller ManagedBean. It is requestscoped and features two getters and setters for setting a username and password, and two navigation methods, codeauthenticatecode and codelogoutcode, navigating the user to either their private area upon successful login, or back to the main page when logging out.p  pThe codeUserBeancode is an example of a Support ManagedBean. It is sessionscoped and features an instance of codeUsercode class which would be null when you are not authenticated with a getter and setter, nothing more.p  pThe codeAuthenticationControllercode has this user as a managed property codeManagedPropertyvalue  userController.user private User usercode. Upon successful authentication, the codeAuthenticationControllercode would set the managed property to the actual user instance with the corresponding username that was used for the login.p  pAny new beans would be able to grab the user as a managed property as well and pull the data they need, such as group membership for instance, if the codeUsercode class would feature a list with group names.p  pWould this way be the proper way to go about with regard to the seperation of concernsp

Negative 17533 pI have an interesting problem. Id like to create a generic class that can deal with both Reference types as well as codeNullableltTgtcode types. Basically I want something likep  precodepublic class ClassWithNullltTgt      public T varName  null  codepre  pNow this, of course, does not compile because not all types can be assigned null, namely nonnullable value types. But the problem is codeNullableltTgtcode is a value type, so simply adding codewhere T  classcode doesnt help me. My genericsfoo is not too strong, but I havent been able to find any way to say that codeTcode must either be a reference type or a nullable value type. p  pThe idea I have to solve this is to make codeClassWithNullltTgtcode an abstract class. I could then add two subclasses, one to deal with reference types and one to deal with nullable value types. Then, a static factory method in the base class could use reflection to determine which subclass ought to be constructed. Something likep  precodepublic static ClassWithNullltTgt CreateClassWithNullltTgt      StackTrace st  new StackTrace     Type type  st.GetFrame1.GetMethod.GetGenericArguments[0]     if type.IsValueType              return new ClassWithReferenceTypeltTgt          else if type  typeofNullable              return new ClassWithNullableValueTypeltTgt          else              throw new ExceptionMust provide nullable type.       codepre  pThe problem here is that generics are resolved statically. If codeClassWithReferenceTypeltUgtcode expects codeUcode to be a reference type, then calling codenew ClassWithReferenceTypeltTgtcode in the factory method is a compilation error since codeTcode is not required to be a reference type. The compiler does not know about the run time check.p  pAny ideas about how to implement such a thingp

Negative 17533 pShelve is an ultrasimple NoSQL persistence layer which allows you to trivially persist a mapping of objects. Its a commonly used package in Python because it allows you to trivially add persistence to any application. p  pIts simplistic nature means its somewhat limited  but its surprisingly useful. You can map any arbitrary hashable key onto any serializable object. p  pDoes something like this exist for Android Im writing a very simple app, and Ive noticed that Im spending a lot of time faffing around with table structures, select amp insert statements. Thats the sort of thing I almost never do in Python since Id usually have some kind of NoSQL alternative. p  pIm not expecting to to work exactly the same way  clearly Python and Java are languages with very different characteristics. I just want something that nearly as simple to use and requires less manual SQL faffing. p  pOne more thing  this is a fairly trivial app. Id prefer to introduce the bare minimum of additional project dependencies. Preference will be given to solutions which require nothing more than the Android APIs.p

Negative 17533 pId like to display a horizontal scrolling view like a stock ticker but actually containing different content. Ive looked at a few solutions and unfortunately they all make the same assumption that the content is fixed and repeats, ie. cycles around endlessly. p  pIn my case, I want to display an item once, scroll it across and then never show it again. My data arrives asynchronously so there could already be something moving when it arrives or there may be nothing on the screen at all.

How do you use DVCSs with Crucible in such a scenariop  pThere are several issues in a project, for each issue a developer makes a clone of the project from repo stablebuild, to repo dev0001 on a local sharing server.  Clone is named according to the issue  dev0001 for example.p  pNow from there a developer clones on his local machine into clone localdev0001, makes the changes and then pushes to dev0001.p  pSome other developer wants to review the changes in repo dev0001 before the dev that implemented 0001 can push to stablebuild.p  pWhat I tried is to set up Crucible for a repo a separate test clone testcrucible directly from stablebuild. It took a loong time on a very power full machine, about 5 days.p  pMy question is  how can Crucible and Mercurial be set up so that one can create reviews for the dev0001 clone befor eit is pushed to a somewhat central server, withouth waiting 5 days for Crucible to parse the dev0001 repo from the start, and maybe use the information of its parent  Is this already done does it need some sort of pluginp  pI can offer more clarity for the scenario if that was a bit hazzy, Thanksp

Negative 17533 pIm trying to make a simple command forwarder to connect my home computer to a server I own, so that I can push commands to my server and my home pc gets it. Those commands are simple pauseresume for my downloader. My design is, that on a server, I run a hub instance, which creates a window for passing commands and a window for backend to pass those commands to my pc. Im bounding those two windows with a channel, they run a server. When a client connects and sends a message to the hub, it gets streamed through a channel to backend window and then to the real backend on my home pc. When backend responds to the backend window on the hub, the hub prints the result back to the client.p  pWith this approach, only the first message passes and works with my downloader. I have to reconnect the backend from my home pc with the hub each time I get a message to get this working properly. I dont think thats the proper way with websockets, so here I am. After one successful request when the backend finishes its work and replies the result, it gets looped forever with EOF error.p  pThe important parts of the code arep  ul lia hrefhttpsgithub.comfarnoygosabblobreproducablesosrcgosabcmdcommands.gomain executableali lia hrefhttpsgithub.comfarnoygosabblobreproducablesosrcgosabhubhandlershandlers.gohub handlersali lia hrefhttpsgithub.comfarnoygosabblobreproducablesosrcgosabbackendconnectorconnector.gobackend connectorali ul  pIf you put the source in your GOPATH im developing it for the tip version of go to support modern websockets, to compile it codego build gosabcmdcode, to run itp  ul licode.cmd modehubcode emhubemli licode.cmd modebackend addresslocalhost8082code embackendemli ul  pTo pass messages to the hub, use this javascriptp  precodevar s  new WebSocketwslocalhost8082 s.send1 5 codepre  pSo how do I handle it Are channels a good way to communicate between two different requestsp

Negative 17533 pI am building a custom MVC framework using PHP. My problem is when I want to access any model class through the controller class. One way I have seen this done is through a registry design pattern using magic methods such as get and set, though PHP get and set are considered bad practise by some. I have read about dependency injection done through a container, but I can not see this working effectily as the container would have to call the models or it would have to contain the models which would defeat the purpose of MVC and create a massive super class. Singleton is seen as bad practise. Is there any solutions or improvements of the methods I have mentioned.

Negative 17533 pIm writing a Ruby on Rails app which with user input will generate some Java code that the server will then compile amp execute. Dont ask why p  pThe problem is the users are able to enter in strings which need to be used as string literals in the Java.

How can I sanitize the string in RoR in order to prevent users terminating the strings and thus being able to execute arbitrary code on the server.p

Negative 17533 pIve been chasing down a crash that seems to be due to memory corruption. The setting is C, building using llvm for iOS. p  pThe memory corruption is absent in debug mode and with optimization level 0 O0. In order to be able to step through the code, Ive rebuilt with debug symbols but optimization level 1 O1. This is enough to reproduce the crash and it allows me to step through the program. p  pIve narrowed the problem down to a particular function call. Before it, the value of a certain pointer is correct. After it, the value is corrupted it ends up equalling 0x02, for whatever that is worth. p  pLldb doesnt seem to want to watch variables or memory locations. Switching to gdb, I find that if I try to print the address of the aforementioned variable I encounter the following message Address requested for identifier x which is in register r4. p  pI understand that, as an optimization, the compiler may decide to keep the value of a variable  in a register.

Negative 17533 pI need to store telemetry data that is being generated every few minutes from over 10000 nodes which may increase, each supplying the data over the internet to a server for logging.  Ill also need to query this data from a web application.p  pIm having a bit of trouble deciding what the best storage solution would be..p  pEach node has a unique ID, and there will be a timestamp for each packet of variables. probably will need to be generated by the server.p  pThe telemetry data has all of the variables in the same packet, so conceptually it could easily be stored in a single database table with a column per variable.  The serial number  timestamp would suffice as a key. The size of each telemetry packet is 64 bytes, including the device ID and timestamp.  So around 100Gb per year.p  pId want to be able to query the data to get variables across time ranges and also store aggregate reports of this data so that I can draw graphs.p  pNow, how best to handle this  Im pretty familiar with using MySQL, so Im leaning towards this.  If I were to go for MySQL would it make sense to have a separate table for each device ID  Would this make queries much faster or would having 10000s of tables be a problem  p  pI dont think querying the variables from all devices in one go is going to be needed but it might be.  Or should I just stick it all in a single table and use MySQL cluster if it gets really bigp  pOr is there a better solution  Ive been looking around at some non relational databases but cant see anything that perfectly fits the bill or looks very mature.  MongoDB for example would have quite a lot of size overhead per row and I dont know how efficient it would be at querying the value of a single variable across a large time range compared to MySQL.

Negative 17533 pI am attempting to build an almost static application because of portability concerns. I hope to be able to run the executable on several 64 bit linux distributions. I have been successful at statically linking Qt and building with statically linked libstdc and libgcc. p  pHowever, I have some 3rd party library concerns. I built Qt with qtzlib, but my end application is still dynamically linked with the system zlib. Specifically I configured withp  precode.configure static nomake demos nomake examples nomake tools release nowebkit qtzlib nogif qtlibtiff qtlibpng qtlibmng qtlibjpe codepre  pI removed all references linking to zlib in the application, assuming that the application would be able to link to the Qts statically built zlib. It almost appears to me that Qt is ignoring the qtzlib flag, and using the system library, which then my application also uses.p  pFurthermore, I had to install the libfontconfigdev package so the font after building from source would not be horrific, but now Qt is also dynamically linking to it. There is a static library for libfontconfig that I tried to link to, as you can see, but because Qt is already linked to libfontconfig, the linker ignores it. Is there a way during the Qt build of being able to specify not to dynamically link to 3rd party libraries p  pI do not want any of Qts dependencies to be statically linked, if possible. Right now I believe the application will work on at least Ubuntu 12.04, but other distributions very well may place some of the libraries in different places.p  pSnippet from my .pro filep  precodeQT  core        gui        opengl QMAKECXXFLAGS  fpermissive QMAKELFLAGS  staticlibgcc staticlibstdc CONFIG  static TEMPLATE  app LIBS  usrlocalliblibboostthread.a          usrlocalliblibboostprogramoptions.a          usrlibx8664linuxgnulibfontconfig.a          usrlibx8664linuxgnulibGLU.a codepre  pOutput from lddp  precodelinuxvdso.so.1 gt  0x00007fff992b4000 libSM.so.6 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibSM.so.6 0x00007f195ccbc000 libICE.so.6 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibICE.so.6 0x00007f195caa2000 libfontconfig.so.1 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibfontconfig.so.1 0x00007f195c86b000 libfreetype.so.6 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibfreetype.so.6 0x00007f195c5cf000 libXext.so.6 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibXext.so.6 0x00007f195c3be000 libX11.so.6 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibX11.so.6 0x00007f195c089000 libdl.so.2 gt libx8664linuxgnulibdl.so.2 0x00007f195be85000 librt.so.1 gt libx8664linuxgnulibrt.so.1 0x00007f195bc7d000 libGL.so.1 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnumesalibGL.so.1 0x00007f195ba1c000 libpthread.so.0 gt libx8664linuxgnulibpthread.so.0 0x00007f195b7ff000 libm.so.6 gt libx8664linuxgnulibm.so.6 0x00007f195b505000 libc.so.6 gt libx8664linuxgnulibc.so.6 0x00007f195b147000 lib64ldlinuxx8664.so.2 0x00007f195ced9000 libuuid.so.1 gt libx8664linuxgnulibuuid.so.1 0x00007f195af42000 libexpat.so.1 gt libx8664linuxgnulibexpat.so.1 0x00007f195ad18000 libz.so.1 gt libx8664linuxgnulibz.so.1 0x00007f195ab00000 libxcb.so.1 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibxcb.so.1 0x00007f195a8e2000 libglapi.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibglapi.so.0 0x00007f195a6bd000 libXdamage.so.1 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibXdamage.so.1 0x00007f195a4b9000 libXfixes.so.3 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibXfixes.so.3 0x00007f195a2b3000 libX11xcb.so.1 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibX11xcb.so.1 0x00007f195a0b1000 libxcbglx.so.0 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibxcbglx.so.0 0x00007f1959e99000 libXxf86vm.so.1 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibXxf86vm.so.1 0x00007f1959c94000 libdrm.so.2 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibdrm.so.2 0x00007f1959a89000 libXau.so.6 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibXau.so.6 0x00007f1959885000 libXdmcp.so.6 gt usrlibx8664linuxgnulibXdmcp.so.6 0x00007f195967f000 codepre  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI have since given up on this task as it does not seem doable.

So that it can read data from different view models. Why have 9 or 50 controllers esentially doing the same jobp  pThen I want to do likewise with the views. So that different fields can be dynamically generated. Why have 9 or 50 views all doing the same job. If the view is based on the controller, the view should be able to change based on its properties.p  pEssentially all I want to do is find a way to tell the controller to read from viewmodel X or VM  Y or VM  Z ect and it should be able to generate the properties, retreive the associated data, and pass it to the view, which upon receiving, will generate the fields with labels and text boxes.p  pI guess I want to know if there is any way to do this using reflection. As the view models are basic classes with simple properties. One could potentially create a base controller class that has a method to read in a specified viewmodel object, get its properties, read in also an associated table and match up the fields in that table with the properties in the class. Finally one can pass in the record from the table to display. The view then can be generated automatically based on this using some kind of razor, c or javascript.p  pAny taughts on if this is possible or not would be welcome.p

Negative 17533 pI decided to restrict the scope of visibility by default in repository tree so that public folder will be created for polished things. Now because there are many subrepositories, I am getting a painful commiting or some smart idea. I am not sure about the best way  I thought about traversing the repos with find and then just doing a consistent dummy commit to every repo like codedefault perms lower and polished public things to public dir in the root to get the quality upcode but I may be reinventing the wheel. It is not option for me to limit the amount of subrepositories and submodules so commiting must start from the lowest repo and then little by little traversing up if doing with find.p  pHow would handle this kind of deep Git reporepo tree updatep  pstrongPerhaps relatedstrongp  blockquote   ol   lipa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10068119avoidrepetitivecommittingwithsubsubsubgitreposGit how to avoid repetitive committing with subsubsub...

Negative 17533 pI am using jQuery UI to create a Schedule manager widget that allows the user to resize and sort timeslot elements for a given day. Each timeslot has a duration, which is represented by its height, and a start  end time which is calculated based on its order in the stack and its duration.  Gaps in the schedule are represented by placeholder elements, with their height equating to the gapduration.p  pRight now a user can modify a timeslots duration by resizing it which inversely sizes adjacent placeholders, if any, or they can change its start  end time by sorting it in relation to the other timeslots  placeholders.p  pI would like to also make each timeslot element draggable, so that a user can manually position the element within the day column, at which point its correct startendtime would be calculated along with any other necessary changes such as adding new placeholders or splicing existing timeslotsp  pHowever, when I try to combine the two widgets together, I run into some weird UI bugs and inconsistent behaviors.

Negative 17533 pIm looking to build a browser multiplayer game using rollback netcode that runs a deterministic simulation on the clients. I prototyped the netcode in Flash already before I ran into the floating point roadblock. p  pBasically, from what I understand, integer math in Flash is done by casting codeintcodes to codeNumbercodes, doing the math, then casting back to codeintcode. Its faster apparently, but it means that theres no chance of deterministic math across different computer architectures.p  pBefore I dump all my eggs into the JavaScript basket then, Id like to ask a few questions.p  ol lipIs there true integer arithmetic on all major browsers in JavaScript Or do some browsers do the Flash thing and cast to floatsdoubles to do the math before casting back to intpli lipDoes something like a hrefhttpsgithub.comdtrebbienBigDecimal.js relnofollowcodeBigDecimalcodea or a hrefhttpsgithub.comjtobeyjavascriptbignum relnofollowcodeBigNumcodea work for deterministic math across different computer architectures I dont mind some performance loss as long as its within reason. If not, is there some JavaScript fixed point library out there that solves my problempli lipThis is a long shot, but is there a HTML5 2D game engine that has deterministic math for stuff like xy positions and collisions The list of a hrefhttpsgithub.combebrawjswikiwikiGameEngines relnofollowgame enginesa is overwhelming to say the least.

Negative 17533 pWith ASP controls, like Telerik Controls, you have the Serverside which is referenced and the markup sent to the client.  I was trying to do something NEW with it.p  pI have an ajax call which would return a json object of a MODAL.  This modal will contain a TreeView.  From what I was looking up, is that if i were to do this it wouldnt actually have a backend to reference, as it is essentially pinging the server for some 1time use output.p  pI am trying to change that.  Whawt my goal is to make the ajax ping to build the TV and then on each subsequent node expansion, return all the children of the clicked Node  Sound easy right  Well, Not from the way I am doing it.p  pMy ajax requests were just going to return a string, which is parsed with jQuery into HTML, and then inserted into the modal.

It wont let me do a toString on the TreeView to put the markup into a string.p  pSidenote  The tree doesnt NEED to be preservced, but if you could take the tree and send it back to the server for an update and then return it that works too.p  pI was thinking that after the tree was printed, i would then, on each leaf, just do an ajax request for TreeViewNodes, or.... something similar.p  pThoughts  Ideas  From what I was looking at, and my thought processes, You CANNOT have a DIV be the target of a webserver for updates.  That is more like a frame sort of thing, which i COULD do.... put a frame IN a div, but Im trying to keep it all looking nice, without frames.p

Negative 17533 pI have a shopping cart for my Umbraco site, and buttons to add items into this cart. The cart is displaying at the top of the site in the navigation bar in the form of x Items where x is the number of items in the cart.p  pI use Razor to build the navigation and render out this cart. It grabs the cart id from the session and gets the number of items from the database to display in place of x.p  precode   Cart cart  null   int numItems  0    ifSession[cartid]  null          int cid  Convert.ToInt32Session[cartid]       cart  CartFactory.GetCartcid       ifcart  null                  numItems  cart.Items.Count              lta href...gt     ltspangtnumItems Itemsltspangt ltagt codepre  pMy code to add an item simply gets the current cart id from the session or creates a new cart if it is not set and inserts a cart item in the database.p  precodeprotected void addToCartobject sender, EventArgs e    Create Cart if one does not exist in session   if Session[cartid]  null       Session[cartid]  CartFactory.CreateCart   int cid  Convert.ToInt32Session[cartid]     ... add the item to the database...    string script  highlightCart   this.Page.ClientScript.RegisterStartupScriptPage.GetType, Key, script, true  codepre  pOn clicking Add to cart, the item is added to the database and the cart is highlighted through calling a javascript function. However, the X items is not updated until i reload the page again, and im not sure why.p  pIm also unsure if this is to do with Razor caching the value, but as as far as I am aware i have not enabled this. I initially called addToCart through an updatePanel to do it without refreshing the page, but removed this so that the Razor would reload, grab the cart again and reflect the updates, yet it doesnt to this until i refresh the page myself.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI came across this same issue in another area of the site the viewcart page. Here, I have a control that loads the current cart and its tickets. I have a button to update the quantities and after clicking this, a similar thing happened. I had to refresh the page manually for the changes to show.p  pI fixed this by simply calling the LoadCart method at the end of the update cart method. However, I cant take this approach with the razor cart mentioned above. I have a user control with the button and the action to addToCart, and a razor macro that displays the number of items in the cart. Is there a way I can get this macro to update without refreshing manuallyp
Negative 17533 pIve been reading info on this the past few days and though Ive made some progress, Im still a bit lost.p  pI have created a collection of classes, files, and folders that together I want to join together as a Visual Studio Item Template.p  pThink of it as a module.p  pThe idea is that they add this Module Item Template and Visual Studio will insert the folders and files and rename them accordingly.p  pThis is not a PROJECT template it is an ITEM TEMPLATE, because it needs to be added to an already existing project they are working on, within that project not as a separate one.p  pBy using the Visual Studio 2010 SP1 SDK Item Template Template, Ive ALMOST got it.p  pThe problem is that when I use the safeitemname I get different names in each class.p  pI was hoping that when they add the item, and name it say MyModule, the value safeitemname would be MyModule.p  pthis isnt happening. Instead, each generated class file gets a different value for safeitemname that matches the generated file name.p  pSo for example if I have a MyModuleConfig.cs class, and I have another class file setup like thisp  precodepublic class safeitemnameConfig   codepre  pinstead of getting the Item name that the user entered MyModule together with config, the class gets named MyModuleConfigConfig.p  pHow can I tell it to only use the original name that the user entered when they created the module in the Add Item dialog using the templatep

It seems the only way we can reseed is to wipe the database and reseed everything.  I think I understand as to why this does not work the way I expect it to, but perhaps someone could point me in the right direction to update this seed method accordingly.  I know I could just write out context.JunkItems. ... but that seems like it would beat the whole purpose of AddOrUpdate.p  pI think I would have to define keys for each child entity.  Example Junk gets x  x.Name but JunkItem currently has to update key set.  Im assuming thats the issue, but how would I go about handling thatp

Negative 17533 pI have a few questions on using shared memory with processes. I looked at several previous posts and couldnt glean the answers precisely enough. Thanks in advance for your help.p  ol lipIm using shmopen  mmap like below. This code works as intended with parent and child alternating to increment gsharedcount the synchronization is not portable it works only for certain memory models, but good enough for my case for now. However, when I change MAPSHARED to MAPANONYMOUS  MAPSHARED, the memory isnt shared and the program hangs since the flag doesnt get flipped. Removing the flag confirms whats happening with each process counting from 0 to 10 implying that each has its own copy of the structure and hence the count field. Is this the expected behavior I dont want the memory to be backed by a file I really want to emulate what might happen if these were threads instead of processes they need to be processes for other reasons.pli lipDo I really need shmopen Since the processes belong to the same hierarchy, can I just use mmap alone instead I understand this would be fairly straightforward if there wasnt an exec, but how do I get it to work when there is an exec following the forkpli lipIm using kernel version 3.2.023 on x8664 Intel i72600. For this implementation, does mmap give the same behavior correctness as well as performance as shared memory with pthreads sharing the same global object For example, does the MMU map the segment with cacheable MTRRTLB attributes pli lipIs the cleanupshared code correct Is it leaking any memory How could I check For example, is there an equivalent of System Vs ipcspli ol  pthanks, Doobsp  pshmem.hp  precodeifndef SHMEMH define SHMEMH  includes  define LEN 1000 define ITERS 10  define SHMFNAME myshm  typedef struct shmemobj      int count     char buff[LEN]     volatile int flag  shmemt  extern shmemt gshared extern char procname[100] extern int fd  void cleanupshared      munmapgshared, sizeofshmemt     closefd     shmunlinkSHMFNAME   static inline  void initshared      int oflag      if strcmpprocname, parent          oflag  OCREAT  ORDWR      else          oflag  ORDWR           fd  shmopenSHMFNAME, oflag, SIREAD  SIWRITE     if fd  1          perrorshmopen         exitEXITFAILURE           if ftruncatefd, sizeofshmemt  1          perrorftruncate         shmunlinkSHMFNAME         exitEXITFAILURE           gshared  mmapNULL, sizeofshmemt,                      PROTWRITE  PROTREAD,                      MAPSHARED, fd, 0     if gshared  MAPFAILED          perrormmap         cleanupshared         exitEXITFAILURE        static inline  void procwriteconst char s      fprintfstderr, [s] sn, procname, s   endif  SHMEMH codepre  pshmem1.c parent processp  precodeinclude shmem.h  int fd shmemt gshared char procname[100]  void work      int i     for i  0 i amplt ITERS i          while gsharedgtflag         gsharedgtcount         sprintfgsharedgtbuff, s d, procname, gsharedgtcount         procwritegsharedgtbuff         gsharedgtflag  gsharedgtflag        int mainint argc, char argv[], char envp[]      int status, child     strcpyprocname, parent     initsharedargv     fprintfstderr, Map address is pn, gshared      if child  fork           work         waitpidchild, ampstatus, 0         cleanupshared         fprintfstderr, Parent finishedn      else   child executes shmem2          execvpe.shmem2, argv  2, envp        codepre  pshmem2.c child processp  precodeinclude shmem.h  int fd shmemt gshared char procname[100]  void work      int i     for i  0 i amplt ITERS i          while gsharedgtflag         gsharedgtcount         sprintfgsharedgtbuff, s d, procname, gsharedgtcount         procwritegsharedgtbuff         gsharedgtflag  gsharedgtflag        int mainint argc, char argv[], char envp[]      int status     strcpyprocname, child     initsharedargv     fprintfstderr, Map address is pn, gshared     work     cleanupshared     return 0  codepre

When the user chooses a new selection, the codeSelectedItemcode changes, but my model is not updated properly, and the codeSelectionBoxItemcode item displayed in the combobox is not changed. p  pMore specifically, I have the following two elementsp  precodeltListView NamelvNodes ItemsSourceBinding PathNodes SelectedItemBinding PathCurrentNode, ModeTwoWaygt                     ltListView.ItemTemplategt                         ltDataTemplategt                             ltStackPanel OrientationHorizontalgt                                 ltTextBlock TextBinding PathNamegt                             ltStackPanelgt                         ltDataTemplategt                     ltListView.ItemTemplategt                 ltListViewgt codepre  pThis listview works as expected. The combobox that is having problems is defined like sop  precodeltComboBox ItemsSourceBinding PathCameraViews SelectedItemBinding PathCurrentNode.NodeInfo.Camera1, ConverterStaticResource EnsureBlank, ModeTwoWay NamecomboBoxTopCam SelectionChangedcomboBoxTopCamSelectionChangedgt                                 ltComboBox.ItemTemplategt                                     ltDataTemplategt                                         ltTextBlock TextBinding PathNamegt                                     ltDataTemplategt                                 ltComboBox.ItemTemplategt                             ltComboBoxgt codepre  pSo when the user selects a node from the ListView above, the ComboBox updates to display the camera that node is using. p  pNow the strange behavior. If the user clicks on a new item on the combo box, I can stop with the debugger and examine the codeSelecteItemcode property. This is always set properly, however the codeCurrentNode.NodeInfo.Camera1code property is not changed, and the string displayed in the SelectionBox is unchanged. p  pIt gets even stranger, however. If the user switches the node using the ListView defined earlier AFTER making such a selection on the ComboBox, the ComboBox again doesnt display the new value, but the codeSelectedItemcode is correct. If the user then changes the selected item in the ListView AGAIN, then it starts displaying the correct value, and is fine until the user messes with the combo box again. p  pNow I said earlier that my model is not being updated when the ComboBox changes, so I made an event handler to update the model for me you can see this in the definition of the ComboBox. This is defined as possiblep  precodeprivate void comboBoxTopCamSelectionChangedobject sender, SelectionChangedEventArgs e              CameraViewInfo selCam  comboBoxTopCam.SelectedItem as CameraViewInfo         if selCam  null                      OTNode selNode  lvNodes.SelectedItem as OTNode              if selCam.Name  None                 selNode.NodeInfo.Camera1  new CameraViewInfo             else                 selNode.NodeInfo.Camera1  selCam  lt This line affects the behavior               codepre  pWhen I comment out the marked line in the above listing, the ComboBox displays the correct item in the SelectionBox, but doesnt update my model e.g. codeCurrentNode.NodeInfo.Camera1code is not changed. This happens when I use codelvNodes.SelectedItemcode OR when I use codeCurrentCameracode the databound property, it makes no difference which.p  pI know this is a pretty weird problem, and I did the best I could explaining it, if anyone wants more information debug output from databindings, code for the converter, information about equality operators etc I am happy to provide it, I would event be willing to upload a video showing the odd behavior if necessary, since its a little hard to make sense of from text alone.p  pUpdatep  h3Code for Converterh3  precodepublic class EnsureBlankConterter

Negative 17533 pI have placed one large ball, centerBall, in the center of the stage. Then I added in a bunch of smaller ones, giving them random sizes and velocities. These will move with basic motion code and bounce off the walls. On each frame, did a distancebased collision check between each moving ball and the center ball. If I got a collision, Ive calculated an offset spring target based on the angle between the two balls and the minimum distance.  There is still one problem some of the smaller balls bypass centerBall boundaries and then bounce off. You can see that in the attached image.

Negative 17533 pIs there a way to make codeXmlWritercode output single quotes rather than double quotes when writing attributesp  pI am emnotem interested in codeXmlTextWritercode which has a codeQuoteCharcode property oddly not part of codeXmlWriterSettingscode. Also overriding some existing writer class isnt really feasible, except perhaps for wrapping one.p  pReason for asking Im outputting json in html data attributes, as the json quote character is  this easily leads to a little explosion in data due to  being escaped to ampquot everywhere. If I could use the single quote to start the attribute value, the double quote in the json would not require escaping.p  pI am outputting xhtml, and according to questions such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions273354aresinglequotesallowedinhtmlthisa one, single quotes are legal to delimit attribute values.p  pIm pretty sure theres no sane way to do this, but who knows I missed something.p

Negative 17533 pI have an alert dialog which is started when someone touches a specific button. The alert dialog contains a view that is defined by a layout xml file. This layout contains several controls like check boxes, edit text fields, ... These controls are all inside a scrool view so that you can scroll through the content, if the whole content doesnt fit on the screen.p  pThe problem is now that when I start this alert dialog, the buttons at the bottom are cut off screen. Altough the scrool bar is working and I can scroll through the content of the alert dialog, the buttons of the alert dialog are sometimes not totally visible.p  pThis means Sometimes, all is fine and I can see the buttons of the alert dialog, an sometimes for strange reason, the buttons are cut off. I think its an issue of the view being to big for the alert dialog and pushing the buttons more down. For example, the view contains an edit text control. If I enter my name ther, everything is fine. But if I add a new line to this edit text, the buttons start to be cut off a little bit.  What did I wrong I thought the scroll view would handle the oversize of my view so that the alert dialog fits to the screen.

Negative 17533 pI have a view that is set up nicely using autolayout. The view contains a series of labels stacked from top to bottom. I am allowing the intrinsic size of these labels to determine the size of the view.p  pThe final step is to add a background from an image. I started by trying the codecolorWithPatternImagecode method on codeUIColorcode but this isnt quite what I am looking for. I do not want to tile the image, and I can not guarantee it will always be larger than the intrinsic size of the view. p  pSimilarly, adding a codeuiImageViewcode to the view itself doesnt quite work. The view will expand to accommodate the image when I want to keep the intrinsic size based on the labels.p  pI guess what I am looking for is the following.p  p1 The background should have no effect on the size of the view. 2 The image should be scaled to fill the view but in its original aspect ration so cropping edges if necessary.p  pAny ideas appreciated.p

Negative 17533 pIm trying to deploy a very basic GWT app to tomcat and running into problems. I took the sample GWT project in eclipse, tested it to make sure it ran, then right clicked and selected google  gwt compile. I then took the war file, zipped it up and renamed it gwtproject.war.

Yet every time I navigate to localhost808GwtProject I get a 404 error. p  pFrom what Ive gathered reading several posts this looks like its an .xml configuration issue.

Negative 17533 pHope you can help.  Im trying to connect to an Oracle database using SSMA for Oracle v5.2.1259.  I have tried connecting to the remote database Oracle 10g and to a local database database Oracle 11g but neither is working.p  pWhat I would ideally like to do is to connect to the remote database and migrate the schema over.  I can connect to the remote database using Oracle SQL Developer but when I try with SSMA it doesnt workp  pIn Oracle SQL Developer I am using Username SYS but I have to set the Role to SYSDBA and it lets me connect fine.  When Im using SSMA I am using the following settingsp  precodeProvide Oracle Client Provider Mode Standard Mode Servername same IP address used in SQL Developer Server Port 1521 same as SQL Developer Oracle SID PROD same as SQL Developer User name SYS same as SQL Developer Password same as SQL Developer codepre  pBut when I try to connect from SSMA I get the errorp  precodeConection to Oracle failed ORA01017 invalid usernamepassword logon denied codepre  pI tried setting up a local copy of the database and the same server as SSMA, again I can connect fine with SQL Developer but when I try to connect using SSMA I get the messagep  precodeConnection to Oracle failed.

But, I am still just not getting the correct product of the matrices.  I am using the c library Eigen, and I am reading in the numbers for the elements of the matrix as doubles.

Negative 17533 pHaving a slight problem with a tiny bit of code.

Negative 17533 pThe code below shows the following setup with Rails 4, cocoon gem, and simpleform.

Negative 17533 pI have a webpage called PageA that has a header and a main navigation bar and then simply includes an iframe. Lets call the page within the iframe PageB. PageB simply has a list of products but there are a lot of products so you have to scroll down on PageA to view them all.p  pWhen I scroll down PageA to see the bottom of pageB and click on a product link it looks like it takes me to a blank page. What actually happens is that it brings up the product image and description but since the page that just has one product and its description is much shorter in height, the scroll bar stays at the same location and doesnt adjust for it. I have to scroll up to the top of the page to view the product, description and to see the add to cart button.p  pIs there anyway when I click a link on a page that is within an iframe, the outer pages scroll bar goes back up to the topp  precodeltiframe srcshop.undergloled.com onloadwindow.scroll0,0 width980 height1400 frameborder0 styledisplayblock seamlessgt ltiframegt codepre

Negative 17533 pWHAT IM TRYING TO DOp  pSo Im trying to implement a multitenant database architecture using SQL Azure, PHP 5.4, Zend Framework 2, and Doctrine 2. Im going with the Shared Database, Separate Schemas architecture as mentioned in this article a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa479086.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa479086.aspxap  pUnlike simple multitenant environments, my environment has certain use cases where a User from Tenant A should be able to access information from a table in Tenant B. So because of this there are root or global tables that arent made for each tenant and are instead used by all tenants. So as an example, I could have a table called users that exists for each tenant each with a unique schema name e.g. tenanta.users and tenantb.users. I would then also have a root schema for things like global permissions e.g. root.userpermissions.p  pWHAT IVE DONEp  pIn codeModule.phpcodes codeonBootstrapcode function Ive set up a codeloadClassMetadatacode event for dynamically changing the schemas of tables, like sop  precodeentityManager  serviceManagergtgetdoctrine.entitymanager.ormdefaultgtgetEventManager entityManagergtaddEventListenerarray DoctrineORMEventsloadClassMetadata , new PrependTableEvent  codepre  pThe codePrependTableEventcode object uses session data to know which schema to use, it looks like sop  precodenamespace ApplicationModel  use ZendSessionContainer  class PrependTableEvent   private session  public function construct       thisgtsession  new Containerbase   public function loadClassMetadataDoctrineORMEventLoadClassMetadataEventArgs eventArgs       classMetadata  eventArgsgtgetClassMetadata     table  classMetadatagttable     tablename  explode., table[name]      if  root  tablename[0] ampamp NULL  thisgtsessiongtqueryschema           table[name]  thisgtsessiongtqueryschema . . . tablename[1]           classMetadatagtsetPrimaryTabletable   codepre  pIn order for codeloadClassMetadatacode to be called everytime the codequeryschemacode changes I built a codeQuerySchemaManagercode that looks like sop  precodenamespace ApplicationModel  use DoctrineORMEvents, DoctrineORMEventLoadClassMetadataEventArgs, DoctrineORMMappingClassMetadata, DoctrineORMEntityManager, ZendSessionContainer  class QuerySchemaManager   private static session private static initialized  FALSE  private static function initialize       QuerySchemaManagersession  new Containerbase     QuerySchemaManagerinitialized  TRUE   public static function reloadtablename EntityManager em, class, schema       if   QuerySchemaManagerinitialized            QuerySchemaManagerinitialize           QuerySchemaManagersessiongtqueryschema  schema     if emgtgetEventManagergthasListenersEventsloadClassMetadata           eventArgs  new LoadClassMetadataEventArgsemgtgetClassMetadataclass, em         emgtgetEventManagergtdispatchEventEventsloadClassMetadata, eventArgs        public static function reloadalltablenames EntityManager em, schema       if   QuerySchemaManagerinitialized            QuerySchemaManagerinitialize           QuerySchemaManagersessiongtqueryschema  schema     if emgtgetEventManagergthasListenersEventsloadClassMetadata           metadatas  emgtgetMetadataFactorygtgetAllMetadata         foreachmetadatas as metadata              eventArgs  new LoadClassMetadataEventArgsmetadata, em             emgtgetEventManagergtdispatchEventEventsloadClassMetadata, eventArgs                 codepre  pAll that code works great and properly updates the ClassMetadata files for each entity.p  pTHE PROBLEMp  pI have an issue with Doctrine 2 where when I insert values into a table for Tenant A and then try to insert values into the same table for Tenant B, all the rows get inserted into Tenant As table. p  pI spent a lot of time following break points to find the problem, but I still have no idea how to solve it.p  pNote All the following Code is from Doctrine, so it cantshouldnt be edited by mep  pThe problem is that codeEntityManagergtunitOfWorkcode has a private array called codepersisterscode that stores in my case codeBasicEntityPersistercode objects. Every time one of the codeBasicEntityPersistercodes are needed codeUnitOfWorkcodes codegetEntityPersisterentityNamecode is called which looks like sop  precodepublic function getEntityPersisterentityName        if   issetthisgtpersisters[entityName]           class  thisgtemgtgetClassMetadataentityName          if classgtisInheritanceTypeNone               persister  new PersistersBasicEntityPersisterthisgtem, class           else if classgtisInheritanceTypeSingleTable               persister  new PersistersSingleTablePersisterthisgtem, class           else if classgtisInheritanceTypeJoined               persister  new PersistersJoinedSubclassPersisterthisgtem, class           else               persister  new PersistersUnionSubclassPersisterthisgtem, class                    thisgtpersisters[entityName]  persister            return thisgtpersisters[entityName]   codepre  pSo it will create one codeBasicEntityPersistercode per entity i.e. ApplicationModelUser will have one codeBasicEntityPersistercode even though its schema name will dynamically change, which is fine. p  pEach codeBasicEntityPersistercode has a private member called codeinsertSqlcode which stores the insert SQL statement once it has been created. When the insert statement is needed this method is calledp  precodeprotected function getInsertSQL        if thisgtinsertSql  null           return thisgtinsertSql             columns    thisgtgetInsertColumnList      tableName  thisgtquoteStrategygtgetTableNamethisgtclass, thisgtplatform       if emptycolumns           identityColumn   thisgtquoteStrategygtgetColumnNamethisgtclassgtidentifier[0], thisgtclass, thisgtplatform          thisgtinsertSql  thisgtplatformgtgetEmptyIdentityInsertSQLtableName, identityColumn           return thisgtinsertSql             values   array      columns  arrayuniquecolumns       foreach columns as column           placeholder             if issetthisgtclassgtfieldNames[column]               ampamp issetthisgtcolumnTypes[thisgtclassgtfieldNames[column]]              ampamp issetthisgtclassgtfieldMappings[thisgtclassgtfieldNames[column]][requireSQLConversion]                type         TypegetTypethisgtcolumnTypes[thisgtclassgtfieldNames[column]]              placeholder  typegtconvertToDatabaseValueSQL, thisgtplatform                     values[]  placeholder             columns  implode, , columns      values   implode, , values       thisgtinsertSql  sprintfINSERT INTO s s VALUES s, tableName, columns, values       return thisgtinsertSql   codepre  pThese three lines are the culpritp  precodeif thisgtinsertSql  null      return thisgtinsertSql  codepre  pIf those lines were commented out then it would work perfectly as the metadata it uses to create the insertSql statement updates properly. I cant find a way to deleteoverwrite the insertSql variable, or to even deleteoverwrite the whole codeBasicEntityPersistercode. p  pAnyone whos implemented a multitenant environment using Doctrine 2 I would like to know how you did it.

Negative 17533 pOne week ago I had some trouble with my web app getting bigger and bigger, and realized I had to find some kind of async JS loader, so I could load scripts when I really needed them.p  pI found requireJS and read a lot about it and AMD. Everything seems just right, it would help me organize my code in modules and I would have all the async loaddependencies resolving benefits.p  pMy app is a single page one, all HTML is rendered in the browser using templates. I used grunt to concatenate and minify all my JS together and loaded it by script tags. p  pThe load time of my application I measured it by setting a variable in the codeltheadgtcode using codeperformance.nowcode, and another one in the application render function was around 90ms.p  pBut my surprise was, after changing the core of my application to work with requireJS, and using the optimization tool to concatenate and minify everything, the load time raised up to 150ms.p  pI just think its very strange, because on both cases all JS was concatenated in one file. I would understand if requireJS had to make another request to get my app.js, but it doesnt.p  pSo  my question is Is there any way to make requireJS load faster Is there any workaround Or any alternativep  pI thoroughly searched on google for similar problems but couldnt find any hint.p  p editp  pI created this jsFiddle to show you what I mean a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netfedevegiliNhq3q relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netfedevegiliNhq3qap  pAs you can see, the start means the time after requirejs was loaded and before defining Test.p  pExecution means the time when Test content was executed.p  pDone means the callback time.p  pI cant figure out why it takes almost 78ms just to call a function that was just defined.p  pMy test result wasp  precodeStart 2ms Executed 80ms Callback 81ms codepre  p edit2p  pI just tried the same JSFiddle using curljs a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netfedevegili67rBB relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netfedevegili67rBBap  pMy test results werep  precodeTesting with curljs   Start 1ms Executed 1ms Callback 55ms codepre  pAs you can see, the code executes as soon as it is defined.

Negative 17533 pI am having a problem with my app project and as you can see in code I have an asynctask which should check the internet connection and load necessary data from the cloud. If the connection fails, I have an alertdialog which will be shown to deliver an error message. This alertdialog has retry button to repeat the whole procedure by executing the new instance of the async task. I also have a TextView txtRetry, which does the same. This TextView is invisible and it should stay like that as long as the user doesnt close the alertdialog. The problem is when the user clicks on the retry button in the alertdialog it starts new asynctask and it somehow makes my TextView also visible, but it should not. Do you have any idea, what could cause this problem...p  pThis ist the activityp  precodepublic class InitActivity extends Activity   private Context ctx       this textview should be invisible after     the user clicks on the retry button in the alertdialog  TextView txtRetry   private AlertDialog alertDialog private AlertDialog.Builder builder  Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.activityinit      ctx  this     txtRetry  TextView findViewByIdR.id.btnRetry     txtRetry.setOnClickListenernew OnClickListener           Override         public void onClickView arg0              txtRetry.setVisibilityView.INVISIBLE             new MyAsyncTask.executeVoid[] null                    Handler handler  new Handler      handler.postDelayednew Runnable           Override         public void run              MyAsyncTask task  new MyAsyncTask             task.setTxtRetrytxtRetry             task.executeVoid[] null               , 1000      this.initializeAlertDialog   private void initializeAlertDialog      builder  new AlertDialog.Builderctx     builder.setCancelabletrue     builder.setTitleR.string.adtitle     builder.setMessageR.string.admsg               this is the retry button in the alertdialog      builder.setNeutralButtonR.string.btnRetry,             new DialogInterface.OnClickListener           public void onClickDialogInterface dialog, int id              alertDialog.cancel             alertDialog.dismiss             MyAsyncTask task  new MyAsyncTask             task.setTxtRetrytxtRetry             task.executeVoid[] null                     builder.setOnCancelListenernew OnCancelListener           Override         public void onCancelDialogInterface arg0              txtRetry.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE                 private class MyAsyncTask extends AsyncTaskltVoid, Void, Voidgt       private ProgressDialog pd     String title  getResources.getStringR.string.titlepdconnectingtotheserver     String msg  getResources.getStringR.string.msgpdconnectingtotheserver     boolean success  false             private TextView txtRet      Override     protected void onPreExecute          pd  new ProgressDialogctx         pd.setTitletitle         pd.setMessagemsg         pd.setCancelablefalse         pd.setIndeterminatetrue         pd.show           Override     protected Void doInBackgroundVoid... params                        connection to the server is simulated here...

Negative 17533 pIm sure this is a simple fix, but I havent figured it out yet after research. p  pI have a multipage input form that presents a summary page of the data from the input fields.  The input fields have a  default string which describes the input field and is basically the id attribute.  When the user clicks into the input field to enter data, the default data disappears and the new data is entered.  If the user makes no entry into the input field, the default data remains as it should.  The summary page displays all of the inputs from the form fields, including the default data. The problem Im having is figuring out how clear the default data prior to displaying the summary page.

Negative 17533 pWhat can be the cause of the edittext looking empty before I move focus to it I have a fragment, which contains an edittext, and I set its text from the argument of the fragment in codeonCreateViewcode. When this fragment is displayed, the edittext is empty, and the text only appears if I move focus to it. p  pI have an activity that displays a couple of fragments. To one of this fragments I pass a number as an argument while adding it programmatically. I want a very simple thing I want this number to be set as text to an codeEditTextcode in that fragment. p  pThe fragment Im interested about is further down, it needs to be scrolled down to be seen. When I scroll to the bottom and that fragment appears, the codeEditTextcode appears blank even though I have already set the value to it.

Now a client talks to service A to do something. But service A in turn talks to B and c then forwards results to client.

Than how will i achieve consistency across services i.e. if C fails than all updates as part of service B should also get rolled back. p  pIs XA is the way to go or something else more elegant is present. p

Negative 17533 pFor years Ive been wondering what the correct way to close a listening ServerSocket in Java is. My implementations always work like this, theyp  ol liCreate a new ServerSocketint.li liStart a thread that calls its accept method in a while true loop.li liStart another thread when accept returns client connects that reads from the client until it disconnects. The accept thread then continues with another accept call.li ol  pBut when I want to close the ServerSocket because my application is exiting, Ive never found another way of doing so other than calling its close method after Ive closed all client Sockets, which causes accept to throw a SocketException, I catch that and break from the while true loop in the accept thread, causing all my threads to exit.p  pI think this is ugly, strictly speaking there is no iexceptioni occurring, closing my ServerSocket is part of my programs normal operation.p  pIs there really no other way of doing this without causing an Exception to be thrownp  pThanks.p

Negative 17533 pSo, Im creating a isometric game in JAVA to put it simply, it has a map made of tiles, and when the user drag the mouse on the screen, the map moves. To give you guys an idea, it currently looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.compuhbS.png altp  pBefore the actual prototype version, I built a small java application that had no Game Loop per se the only thing updating the tilemap position was the event listeners for the mouse dragging, and it called the repaint method after the movement update. It worked fine, and I could select Tiles and move the map without a problem.p  pSince then, I rebuild the prototype thinking in developing something more like a real game engine, with a Game States Manager and a real Game Loop the Game Loop code looks like thisp  precode    init      long start     long elapsed     long wait      whilerunning         start  System.nanoTime          update         draw         drawToScreen          elapsed  System.nanoTime  start         wait  targetTime  elapsed  1000000          ifwait lt 0wait  5         try             Thread.sleepwait          catchException e              e.printStackTrace                codepre  pA GameStateManager is acessed with the update and draw methods, so I can draw the map just fine, like the older prototype. The problem happened when I dragged the mouse on the screen so the map could move the animation became VERY croppy, in the extent that I could actually see the black background between the tiles moving before the final position of all tiles. p  pAt first I thought the problem was in a concurrency between the Game Loop thread and the event listeners of the main class, because the mouseDragged event could be called while the JPanel was trying to draw what the map was like a moment ago then I tested this on my game loop codep  precode        SwingUtilities.invokeLaternew Runnable             public void run                 draw                 drawToScreen                               draw         drawToScreen codepre  pAnd now the prototype is working just fine.p  pSo, my question is, is this performance heavy, or just a bad practice in Java Also, was my concurrency assumption right This is my first time dealing with threads in Java, so I dont really know if I dealed with the problem the right way.p  pobs This is the entire class I made in which the game loop is in a hrefhttppastebin.comRMRHYc5X relnofollowhttppastebin.comRMRHYc5Xap  pobs2 If someone is interested, the game loop logic I worked in was based on a youtube java tutorial made by pj644 named 2D Game Programming in Java.p  pobs3 Sorry if the question became too big, this is my first time posting a question on this sitep

Negative 17533 pWhen I search for a value in my list of names, it returns the corresponding value. But when I delete this value, my ListView does not return all the names on the list again, they disappear. How to solve this Any ideap  pCode of codeTabelaActivity.javacodep  precodepackage com.akzonobel.malote.tabela  import com.akzonobel.malote.R import android.app.Activity import android.os.Bundle import android.text.Editable import android.text.TextWatcher import android.widget.EditText import android.widget.ListView     Very basic Activity, the only things it does   are get the ListView reference from our layout.   Create an Adapter, set the Adapter to the ListView   and handle the onItemClick events for when the user   clicks on a row.   public class TabelaActivity extends Activity      EditText inputSearch     CSVAdapter mAdapter     Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.activitytabela          Lookup our ListView         ListView mList  ListViewfindViewByIdR.id.mList         inputSearch  EditText findViewByIdR.id.inputSearch         Create Adapter. The second parameter is required by ArrayAdapter         which our Adapter extends. In this example though it is unused,         so well pass it a dummy value of 1.         mAdapter  new CSVAdapterthis, 1          attach our Adapter to the ListView. This will populate all of the rows.         mList.setAdaptermAdapter                      This listener will get a callback whenever the user clicks on a row.            The pos parameter will tell us which row got clicked.                      For now well just show a Toast with the state capital for the state that was clicked.                   inputSearch.addTextChangedListenernew TextWatcher               Override             public void onTextChangedCharSequence cs, int arg1, int arg2, int arg3                   When user changed the Text                 TabelaActivity.this.mAdapter.getFilter.filtercs                             Override             public void beforeTextChangedCharSequence arg0, int arg1, int arg2,                     int arg3                   TODO Autogenerated method stub                            Override             public void afterTextChangedEditable arg0                   TODO Autogenerated method stub                                                            codepre  pCode of codeCSVAdapter.javacodep  precodepackage com.akzonobel.malote.tabela  import java.io.BufferedReader import java.io.IOException import java.io.InputStream import java.io.InputStreamReader import java.util.ArrayList import java.util.List import android.annotation.SuppressLint import android.content.Context import android.graphics.Color import android.view.View import android.view.ViewGroup import android.widget.ArrayAdapter import android.widget.Filter import android.widget.TextView      Very basic Custom Adapter that takes state name,capital pairs out of a csv   file from the assets and uses those values to build a List of State objects.   Overrides the default getView method to return a TextView with the state name.      ArrayAdapter  a type of Adapter that works a lot like ArrayList.   SuppressLintDefaultLocale public class CSVAdapter extends ArrayAdapterltStategt     private ListltStategt filteredModelItemsArray     private Filter filter     Context ctx      We must accept the textViewResourceId parameter, but it will be unused     for the purposes of this example.     public CSVAdapterContext context, int textViewResourceId          supercontext, textViewResourceId          Store a reference to the Context so we can use it to load a file from Assets.         this.ctx  context          Load the data.         loadArrayFromFile          Override     public Filter getFilter          if filter  null           filter   new ModelFilter                  return filter                     getView is the method responsible for building a View out of a some data that represents       one row within the ListView. For this example our row will be a single TextView that       gets populated with the state name.       nonJavadoc       see android.widget.ArrayAdaptergetViewint, android.view.View, android.view.ViewGroup            Override     public View getViewfinal int pos, View convertView, final ViewGroup parent                    Using convertView is important. The system will pass back Views that have been           created but scrolled off of the top or bottom of the screen, and thus are no           longer being shown on the screen. Since they are unused, we can recycle them           instead of creating a new View object for every row, which would be wasteful,            and lead to poor performance. The diference may not be noticeable in this           small example. But with larger more complex projects it will make a significant           improvement by recycling Views rather than creating new ones for each row.                   TextView mView  TextViewconvertView         If convertView was null then we have to create a new TextView.         If it was not null then well reuse it by setting the appropriate         text String to it.         ifnull  mView              mView  new TextViewparent.getContext             mView.setTextSize19             mView.setTextColorColor.WHITE                   Set the state name as the text.         mView.setTextgetItempos.getName          We could handle the row clicks from here. But instead         well use the ListView.OnItemClickListener from inside         of MainActivity, which provides some benefits over doing it here.         return mView                  Helper method that loads the data from the states.csv and builds       each csv row into a State object which then gets added to the Adapter.           private void loadArrayFromFile         try               Get input stream and Buffered Reader for our data file.

In other words what cue can I use to determine that there are new songs to analyze on the page.p  pThanksp

Actually, when I click on the button day I obtain this view img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgIkz7.jpg altenter image description here  As you can see at the screenshot above, all the events are All day events which means events which last the whole day whereas each one of them starts at a specific time and ends at a specific time as well.

Negative 17533 pI have the example code below. I have a codeTestcode object which counts to ten, and then is ready to be destroyed. I have a class which is an wrapper for an array of these objects. This class uses the codeupdatecode method every frame, and iterates through the array of codeTestcode objects and update every one. If the current object has reached the maximum count, the reference to the object is removed, and when the iteration is finished, the array becomes compact.p  precoderequire benchmark class Test   def update     counter  0     counter  1   end   def destroy     counter gt 10   end   def dispose      dispose this object   end end  class Tests   def initializenumber     data  []     number.times do        data.pushTest.new     end   end   def adddatadata     data.pushdata   end   def update     data.eachwithindex do t, index       t.update       if t.destroy         t.dispose  need to dispose the sprite object in my realcode before delete ref.         data[index]  nil       end     end.compact   end    this would be another attempt, which is a little bit faster    but this wont work because in my case the objects I use are    sprite objects which needs to be disposed like shown above    before the reference is removed   def update2     data.eachampupdate     data.deleteifobj obj.destroy   end end  iterations  2000000  Benchmark.bm do x   x.report Tests.newiterations.update   x.report Tests.newiterations.update2 end codepre  pOne problem is that this turns out to be performance heavy if many objects are added. Another problem is that, every frame, another object can be added through the codeadddatacode method.

Negative 17533 pgcc compiles C programs as C, and C programs as C, thus requiring an extern C declaration in C.

The test needs to be done on the emcompilerem flavor, not on the emsource codeem flavor.  In both cases the test is being performed inside a C source code listing which is why I mentioned GNUG is inadequate.  To clarify, for test strongmain.cppstrongp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt int  main int argc, char argv   ifdef cplusplus  ltltltlt FIX THIS ONE   stdcout ltlt I was compiled using g ltlt stdendl else   stdcout ltlt I was compiled using gcc ltlt stdendl endif   codepre  pwhen compiled with eitherp  precode g main.cpp codepre  porp  precodegcc main.cpp lstdc codepre  pin both cases, it seems to incorrectly give as output I was compiled using g.  So it would seem that cplusplus is not the correct flag to use in this case.  Am I wrong  Or what is the correct flagp  pEdit 2 Thanks, guys.  Here is one example for you.  Large legacy system Alpha is written mostly in C, with a little C, and uses large legacy source package Charlie, written in C.  It uses the g system to compile and link, and demands that Charlies headers have no extern C definitions in them, or else it refuses to link.  Large legacy system Bravo is written mostly in C, with a little C, and also uses the same legacy source package Charlie, written in C.  It uses the gcc system to compile and link, and demands that Charlies headers must have extern C definitions in them, or else it refuses to link.  New systems Delta, Echo, and Foxtrot would also like to reuse parts of source from Charlie, compiler to be used is uncertain.  The correct answer is to hack Charlies headers, once and for all, with   p  precodeifndef MAGICGINCLUDEFLAGBUTNOTGCC  extern C  endif ... declarations of code ... ifndef MAGICGINCLUDEFLAGBUTNOTGCC   endif codepre  pand then be done with it.  Otherwise there will always be linking problems.  Yes, of course it could be possible to compile two sets of libraries in this particular case, one under C and one under the C convention, and then mandate that thou shalt use this particular library for this particular flavor of linking.  Or I could come up with two sets of headers.  Either of those is inelegant and will continue to cause problems down the road, in this example there are other cases.  As to the comment that both g and gcc are using the same compiler under the hood, and so it cant possibly matter, sadly, it does.  The package as a whole refuses to link when the wrong extern C dogma isisnt included.  Yes, there are other ways of attacking the general problem, but its a simple question.  Either such a flag exists, or it is known not to exist, or the answer is not known definitively.  I dont know, myself.  p

Here is an example.p  precodeFoo fooFunc      Foo f  Foo     return f  codepre  pIf I return an instance of Foo directly on the return, the destructor of that item isnt called until after the equals operator has been called by the equals statement on the line of the call.p  precodeFoo fooFunc      return Foo  codepre  pI suppose this makes sense as I am creating Foo inside the object, and things are cleared up before the object is returned.p  pI think I can resolve this by doing the return like this after writing a new constructor to take Foop  precodeFoo fooFunc      Foo f  Foo     return Foof  codepre  p1 Am I right in my assumptionsp  p2 Is there another way to do it that would not require so many repeated assignment operators being calledp  pEdit Please consider that this function would normally do a lot more than just return Foop
Negative 17533 pI have a form in the middle of my page and I want to change the tab order within that form, but not disrupt the rest of tab flow of the document. I basically have two buttons which Id like swap their tab order. Ive tried tabindex 0, 1, along with a few others. Setting them, messes up the natural order as it tabs to them before the links in the menu etc... Ive seen some examples where tabindex is added to every tabbable element and then their values are set through javascript. I was hoping to avoid something like that. Also moving the buttons is not an option. The html is build to be responsive and they want the buttons to line up a certain way on mobile devices. What is the proper way to achieve thisp

Negative 17533 pI am using Django, my Development server is Windows, and I am using Putty to SSH to the EC2 instance. When I create an Elastic Beanstalk environment, I also create a key pair and assign it to that EBS setting. But, every time I use git aws.push, and push my code to Elastic Beanstalk, after that I cannot SSH using Putty and the same key pair anymore. However, when I assign a new key pair to the EBS environment, I can SSH again, though it terminates my EC2 instance and creates a new one which results in losing my previous settings.p  pI searched to find a tutorial on how to deploy a Django project on EC2 and DBS, without using EBS, but the only document that Amazon has is about how to deploy it on EBS.p  pAny solution would be appreciated. p

Negative 17533 pAny help would be greatly appreciated please. p  pI have a page full of drawers which operate like an accordion. Couldnt use Jquery UI accordion for various reasons. So instead im using Animated Collapse 2.4 from dynamic drive. Each of the drawer divs contain unique forms. On those forms I am using Jquery Validator and tooltipster to display the validation errors. p  pThe problem I have is that when a draw is closed before validation success, the tooltipsters dont disappear completely they hang around where the form was, and if you scroll the page or move around at all they jump to the top left hand side of the screen half shown So they sort of hide but dont fully. Its as if they need positioning just a few more dozen pixels up and left.p  pBecause I have multiple div drawers containing forms, sometimes its necessary to switch to another drawer when completing one particular draws form to reference other data. So sometimes I need users to be able to close a drawer without fully completing each form and come back to it later. p  pAny ideas please p  pYou need to include the js scripts from Dynamic Drive for the animatedcollapse.js  available at a hrefhttpwww.dynamicdrive.comdynamicindex17animatedcollapse.htm relnofollowLinkap  pAlso you need to include the jquery.tooltipster.js and css files which can be

Which means codeXcode must be a var Is there a corner case not here that will allow me to simplify addition all the way downp  pWhat I am noticing is that so never adds 1 and 5 because they are never arguments together in the so method that checks for X and Y to be numbers. X and 1 are the first arguments, then upon recursion codeX1code and 5 are the arguments and it doesnt execute because codenumberXcode fails when X is codeX1codep

I see that the RESTful API calls work and the data is returned, so this is not an issue.p  pWhy is my implementation of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13482351sharingdatabetweendirectivesSharing data between directivesa not working in my casep  pwaCommentsReply directivep  precodewaFrontend.directivewaCommentsReply, [rootScope, Comment, WaFormValidation, WaCommentStore, functionrootScope, Comment, WaFormValidation, WaCommentStore      return          restrict E,         templateUrl stubscommentform.html,         transclude true,         scope              replyTo replyTo,             replyFormList replyFormList,             loggedIn loggedIn,             model model,             id id,             cancelButton cancelButton         ,         controller functionscope              scope.comments  WaCommentStore             if scope.cancelButton  undefined                  scope.cancelButton  true              else                  scope.cancelButton  false                           scope.comment  scope.commentForm                   Comment                      authorname ,                     body ,                     model scope.model,                     foreignkey scope.id,                     parentid scope.replyTo                                            scope.watchreplyFormList, function newValue, oldValue                  if newValue                      scope.replyFormList  newValue                                            if scope.loggedIn  undefined                  scope.loggedIn  false                                          Handles the submission and response of a reply                             return void                           scope.reply  function                  Comment.addscope.comment.thenfunctionresult                      if result.status  fail  result.validation  undefined                          scope.validationErrors  result.validation                         WaFormValidation.validateresult.validation, scope.commentForm                      else if result.status  success                          scope.parent.comments.unshiftresult.data.comment                         scope.comments.unshiftresult.data.comment                         scope.comments.comments.unshiftresult.data.comment                         WaCommentStore.appendscope.model, scope.id, result.data.comment                         scope.comments, scope.id, result.data.comment                         scope.comment                           scope.replyFormList[scope.replyTo]  false                                                                 scope.close  function                  scope.comment                   if scope.replyFormList[scope.replyTo]  undefined                      scope.replyFormList[scope.replyTo]  false                                             ] codepre  pWaCommentStore directivep  precodewaFrontend.factoryWaCommentStore, function      return          comments []       codepre  pwaComments directivep  precodewaFrontend.directivewaComments, [rootScope, Comment, WaCommentStore, functionrootScope, Comment, WaCommentStore      return          restrict E,         templateUrl stubscomments.html,         scope              model commentModel,             id commentFk         ,         controller functionscope              scope.comments  WaCommentStore             scope.loaded  false             scope.loadedMore  true             scope.currentPage  1             scope.loggedIn  false             scope.paging               scope.replyFormList                Comment.commentsscope.model, scope.id.thenfunctionresult                  scope.comments.comments.push.applyscope.comments.comments, result.data.comments                 scope.loggedIn  result.data.loggedIn                 scope.paging  result.paging.Comment                 scope.loaded  true                           scope.loadMore  function                  scope.loadedMore  false                 if scope.paging.nextPage  false                      return false                                  var options                       page scope.paging.page  1                                  Comment.commentsscope.model, scope.id, options.thenfunctionresult                       scope.comments.comments.push.applyscope.comments.comments, result.data.comments                                         scope.paging  result.paging.Comment                     scope.loadedMore  true                                            scope.submitComment  function                  alertscope.authorname  scope.body                           scope.reply  functionreplyId                  scope.replyFormList[replyId]  true                            ] codepre

Negative 17533 pI am trying to fix another developers Wordpress plugin that I would like to utilize but being my wordpress blog is 100 HTTPS Shared SSL Certificate with CDN it creates mixed content errors on the admin panel as well as if displayed on the website. I am not a PHP guy but I have done a lot of coding over the years and code review so I would like to try to work through this.p  pAll other plugins on my website do not require me to use any forced SSL method, and I have already followed the guides for implementing SSL  HTTPS. I have no other SSLHTTPS or mixed content errors and emI do not want to go back to having to use item as it created other issues.p  pI have used the Firefox Inspector and know which files generate the issue httpwpcontentpluginsresourcesscripts.js httpwpcontentpluginsresourcescssthemesdefaultjqueryui.css As well as it serves up images for the plugin as HTTP.p  pThe codePlugins.phpcode file that I open in Firefox shows it registered as HTTP vs. HTTPS.p  pWhat I have looked at I have scanned the code for HTTP and not found any HTTP outside of the header docs and confirmed that the plugin gets its GoogleFonts and Google CoreChart from a hrefhttpswww.google.comjsapi relnofollowhttpswww.google.comjsapia.  p  pI have done some reading and am not clear on this.url usage or if this is the source or not but have read others have the problem. p  pI have scanned the code and did not see any paths that were not ended with a codecode that were not parameters to a specific file themselves.p  precode      sets up the object with the AJAX url and security nonce, also retrieves language properties   setup functionurl, nonce, pluginUrl, userId, callbackFn, skipLoadGlobals      ifPI.ajaxSetup           create custom widgets         initPICustom          PI.globals.pluginUrl  pluginUrl         PI.userId  userId         this.url  url         this.nonce  nonce          ifskipLoadGlobals              this.loadGlobalDatacallbackFn                  else              callbackFn                   else          alertAjax setup function already called      , codepre  pAll of the other references to the URL look something like the followingp  precode    getUserOldestResultYear functionuserId, callbackFn      jQuery.ajax         type post,         url PI.Ajax.url codepre  pAt least one of the files being reported is the a hrefhttpwww.datatables.netdownloaddownload relnofollowDatatables plugina that is about two years old, and a hrefhttpjqueryui.comdownload relnofollowJQueryUI 1.6 or 1.7a that is at least 6 years old. p  pI do not currently use the plugin and would like to. This plugin is still updated is updated about once or twice a year, the developer has their freeware code on GitHub. So I would like to take a shot at fixing it or at very minimum give the developer very specific direction on how to fix it if I figure out most of it using my test site.p  pI cannot provide a link at this time to the specific site because I only activate the plugin when I am actively working on it due to it resulting in errors on the rest of my site when I due activate it. I am looking for guidance on how to further diagnosis the issue and hopefully also how to fix it.p  pSo my questions arep  ol liIs there anything else specific thing I should be looking for in the code to possibly identify the source of these HTTP calls that I may be able to fix relatively easily in the code li liWould simply upgrading JQueryUI and DataTables and likely fix the issue or is this a red herringli liIF 2 is in the affirmative, I downloaded DataTables and the latest JQueryUI would attempting to upgrade the app to use it being they are so far behind likely end up in a total rewrite or is it something that is relatively managable i.e. I have some time but not a lot of time to try to fix this.li liIf the AJAX thing is related, how do I fix itli ol
Negative 17533 pIm working on a very simple problem here Im trying to send a stream of text from appsrc to fakesink, with dumptrue so that I can see the text data that is going through.

I also had tmpData printed out every time so I know that I have the right data instead of things like an empty array. And at the end of onneeddata, I also confirmed that gsignalemitbyname returned GSTFLOWOK, which had me fooled because I assumed that appsrc was sending data correctly after seeing that. Finally, there shouldnt really be anything wrong with fakesink dumptrue either. Could any one of you tell me what Im doing wrong here Any help would be deeply appreciated. p

Additionally, I was reading about design patterns and came to this UML design while reading about singletonsp  pimg srchttpi722.photobucket.comalbumsww226wenamadmenat3.png altSingleton design patternp  pWhich makes me think my initial approach was just right.

Negative 17533 pIm working on a CFD solver. An existing CFD solver that Ive used a fair amount is OpenFOAM.

However, since theyre run repeatedly perhaps even repeatedly within one loop this reduces codeduplication, and also compartmentalizes sections in reasonably obviously named header files.p  pIDEs typically dont like this style of inclusion  they have no idea where all the variables in the header come from, and cant provide any meaningful interpretation of things.p  pIs this style bad, or just a convenient use of C codeincludecode mechanisms In particular, should I attempt to avoid it, perhaps through use of classed objects for each field Is there a better way to do this C11 and Boost are both available, if neededp

Negative 17533 pMy main viewmodel encapsulates a set of workspace viewmodels only one of which is exposed at any given time via a CurrentWorkspace property on the main view model. The user gets to switch between workspaces through a series of radio buttons so that when a radio button is clicked, the value of the CurrentWorkspace is replaced with a new workspace viewmodel.p  pEach workspace has a corresponding view datatemplate so that as workspaces are switched, old view unloads and a new view loads in keeping with the value of CurrentWorkspace property. Now each view has a datagrid that could still be in edit mode when the user may choose to click a radio button forcing view unload that dismantles its visual tree including the datagrid. The problem is that the last pending row edit is not committed to the underlying view model when this happens.p  pI tried to remedy the situation by trying to handle DataGrid LostFocus, LostKeyboardFocus, Unload events as well as the UnloadingRow event but none of them seem to offer a handle to the issue. It seems that once the view unload is triggered, these events either do not fire or fire too late for me to invoke a commit.p  pI would appreciate any help or pointer to where I should look to resolve this issue.p
Negative 17533 pIm working with a Liferay portlet that uses PrimeFaces 5 for its UI. The typical request renders some XHTML template and sends the resulting HTML to the client. Id like to render an XHTML file of my choosing to a string in the context of a commandButton action handler.p  pTo illustrate what Im after, suppose I have the following commandButton definitionp  precodelthformgt     ltpcommandButton valueExport as PDF ajaxfalse actionmyBean.exportPDF gt lthformgt codepre  pWhen clicked, it executes the exportPDF method of the backing bean. Within that method, I load the contents of another xhtml file into a string. This part is done and works. Now, Im guessing that I need to parse the string into a UIComponent hierarchy and then to render that hierarchy using the current FacesContext. This is where Im currently stuck.p  pThe FacesContext has get,setViewRoot methods. The current view root is what the client sees in their browser. How can I replace this view root with one generated from an arbitrary stringp  pAs the button name implies, the desired action is to send the client a PDF. I get the HttpServletResponse instance, output the right headers, and generate the actual PDF content. Im using Flying Saucer for PDF generation and Im basically trying to create the input XHTML from a JSF template. Everything already works except for the template bit. The relevant code is belowp  precodepublic void exportPDF throws DocumentException, IOException      FacesContext ctx  FacesContext.getCurrentInstance      ByteArrayOutputStream buf  new ByteArrayOutputStream     ITextRenderer r  new ITextRenderer     r.setDocumentFromStringgetExportXHTMLctx     r.layout     r.createPDFbuf      HttpServletResponse sr  PortalUtil.getHttpServletResponse             PortletResponsectx.getExternalContext.getResponse     sendPDFsr, buf     ctx.responseComplete   private String getExportXHTMLFacesContext ctx throws IOException      StringBuilder s  new StringBuilder4096     PortletRequest pr  PortletRequestctx.getExternalContext.getRequest     PortletContext pc  pr.getPortletSession.getPortletContext     InputStream is  pc.getResourceAsStreamviewspdf.xhtml     try          InputStreamReader r  new InputStreamReaderis, utf8         char[] buf  new char[4096]         int n         while n  r.readbuf  1              s.appendbuf, 0, n               finally          is.close          String template  s.toString      return   TODO How do I render template with ctx  codepre  pstrongSOLVEDstrongp  pFound the following links that brought me very close to a working solutionp  ul lia hrefhttpwww.ninthavenue.com.auhowtocreateemailfromjsftemplates relnofollowhttpwww.ninthavenue.com.auhowtocreateemailfromjsftemplatesali lia hrefhttpsgithub.comvvasabiProgrammaticFaceletsRenderingExample relnofollowhttpsgithub.comvvasabiProgrammaticFaceletsRenderingExampleali ul  pThe only remaining issue was that I couldnt render anything in the action handler. ctx.getExternalContext.getResponse returned an instance of ActionResponse rather than MimeResponse thats required for rendering. To get around this, I simply rendered XHTML during the initial page load, but waited for the action handler to be called before converting XHTML to PDF. A bit inefficient if the user doesnt want a PDF, but seems to work fine otherwise.p

BUT when its included between the codeltscriptgtltscriptgtcode tags I want it to be rendered verbatim. ie, the codesometextcode Mustache tags should be there in the rendered HTML.

Negative 17533 pI am working on a project that involves heuristics, and I built it in Java Should have probably made it in C. I am running into problems with memory.p  pMy tree is built up with object nodes, and each object contains an array, a matrix, and three integers. I already cut down many other values, in order to try and save more memory space, however, it still isnt enough.p  pSo, I was thinking that I could also cut down the matrix, and transform it into an array. However, my whole project is built on coordinates, to reach a certain point in the matrix. So before I make any change, I would like to know how much or not so much this would affect memory usage.p  pEdit The array and matrix both are made of int primitives.p  pThe array is array[25] and the matrix is matrix[5][5].p  pThe matrix represents the board of the game, with information of whether the field is empty, or has a certain type of piece inside it all int.p  pI am talking about 16GB of RAM usage, and 25 million nodes.p  pI made this method, to clone arraysp  precodepublic int[] cloneArrayint[] array     int i  0     int[] clone  new int[array.length]     while i lt array.length         clone[i]  array[i]         i          return clone  codepre  pSimilar methods were made, to clone matrixes, and the objects themselves.p  pEdit After finding out about the existence of a profiler, I made a check. Here is a screenshot of the results img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comnD216.png altJava profiler statsp  pI think these numbers make sense, because in the console, you can see nearly as many nodes that were counted, as you can see in the profiler, the states in the console, estados is the pointer of the state that is currently being expanded.p  pSo, in the profiler, we can see almost 20m states, which are the generated nodes. Each state contains 1 array and 1 matrix.p  pWe can see 138m arrays, which divided by 6 equals 23m. And since a matrix is 5x5, then 5x23m of the arrays are contained in the matrix, and the other 23m are the arrays.p  pAm I making sense Is this interpretation accuratep  pHere is a dropbox link, so you can check the full resolution image a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.coms7wxz8vch1wnrsyrUntitled.pngdl0 relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.coms7wxz8vch1wnrsyrUntitled.pngdl0ap

Negative 17533 pI have a codeGridViewcode filled with databound content. Each row is selectable. When clicking the row codeselectedindexchangedcode I then filter my second gridview with the data key of the first one the data key of codeGridView1code acts as a filter criteria for codeGridView2code, I change the codeFilterExpressioncode for codeGridView2code to match the data key of codeGridView1code. This works, as codeGridView2code appears to be filtered correctly corresponding to the selected row. However, something strange happens upon selecting a row.p  pSelecting the row filters the second gridview correctly, however the values I get back from the second gridview by doing codeGridView2.Rows[0].Cell2.Textcode always lag one postback behind for only two columns... And it only happens once Ive already selected a row twice Its weird.p  pSo for example if I select the first row in codeGridView1code. This filters my second GridView correctly, giving me a value of 1. So codeGridView2.Rows[0].Cell2.Text  1code. Then if I click the second row in GridView 1, once again GridView 2 filters correctly, showing the right information, but codeGridView2.Rows[0].Cell2.Textcode will still give me 1 instead of lets say 5. Then if I select the third row in GridView1, GridView 2 filters no problem, and codeGridView2.Rows[0].Cell2.Textcode will give me 5. And yet another column contained in the same grid will change correctly. Only two columns are lagging 1 postback behind.p  pI have been working on this for months onandoff and nothing has worked. I have no way of really toubleshooting this... any ideasp  pEDIT The code that occurs during the codeindexchangedcode event per requestp  precodeProtected Sub GridView1SelectedIndexChangedsender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles GridView1.SelectedIndexChanged     Dim rowId As Integer  CIntGridView1.DataKeysGridView1.SelectedIndex.Value     SqlDataSource6.FilterExpression       SqlDataSource6.FilterExpression  InquiryID   amp rowId     GridView2.Visible  True     TextBox2.Text  GridView1.SelectedRow.Cells2.Text     DropDownList2.SelectedValue  GridView1.SelectedRow.Cells3.Text     DropDownList3.SelectedValue  GridView1.SelectedRow.Cells4.Text     DropDownList4.SelectedValue  GridView2.Rows0.Cells1.Text   End Sub codepre  pSo whats happening there is, I get the RowID of the selected row in GridView1, use it to filter GridView2, then I set all the form control values in the page to match the ones in the grid. The postbacks that are one value behind are codeDropDownList2code and codeDropDownList4code. codeDropDownList3codes values are completely fine.p

Negative 17533 pIm getting the codeservingLimitExceededcode error message for results within batch but not for an entire batch. For example, I may get 100 records responding with this error and then it starts returning more results. All within the a single batch.p  pIf batches are handled internally by Google API, how can I adjust them to not hit the rate limit I tried adding a 1second delay between batches but that doesnt change this. I also set coderetries  3code on the Ruby client, but I dont know if that means it retries a failed batch. I dont think its retrying individual API calls within the batch, because the backoff should resolve this. p  pDo I have to record the failed results and create a new batch to recover those separatelyp  pIncidentally, the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comwebmastertoolsv3errorsFORBIDDEN relnofollowdocumented quota limit errorsa are confusing. There are codedailyLimitExceededcode and coderateLimitExceededcode messages but this isnt returning one of those. The codeservingLimitExceededcode description of The overall rate limit specified for the API has already been reached is not all that helpful but Im emassumingem this is the rate limit that we hit.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pLooking at the code, I see that the retries in the ruby codegoogleapiclientcode only apply to a hrefhttpsgithub.comgooglegoogleapirubyclientblobmasterlibgoogleapiclient.rbL637 relnofollowtransmissiona and a hrefhttpsgithub.comgooglegoogleapirubyclientblobmasterlibgoogleapiclient.rbL646 relnofollowauthorizationa 401 errors.

Negative 17533 pIm having a problem in CKEditor version 4.4.6, installed as part of the ExpressionEngine Wygwam module. A website I manage for a rare book dealer includes book pagination descriptions that occasionally contain the string [i] representing a page that would be a Roman numeral i in the sequence but doesnt actually have the character printed on the page. What appears to be happening is that CKEditor is interpreting this as bbcode and turning it into an opening  tag, so the [i] doesnt appear on the page and everything after it is italic. I dont need CKEditor to be parsing bbcode at all, so does anyone know a way to turn it off without breaking anything else Thanks, Aaronp

Forgive my ignorance, I seek the logical steps to the solution, maybe certain technologies or methods that I am currently unaware of,something to look into and find a way to accomplish this task.p  pActual task is work with inventory management system we need to be able to scan barcodesids etc. with one device, while seeing information about the items on another screen think scanning barcodes with an android app, sending it to the web based inventory system, which is open on a tablet computer or something like that and seeing the information about the item on said tablet.p  pNotes we were explicitly told not to use javascala, because the sysadmin doesnt want a jvm running on the same server as the inventory systemappearantly only one server dedicated to that, i assume node.js also falls into the same boat, although im uncertain.p  pThank you for your patience dealing with a complete web development noob p

I thought it could be a result of a difference in my environment variables so I compared the two dumping both environments with the codeenvcode command. There were some extra bash variables in my primary account so one by one Ive unset them until I reached two identical environments with the exceptions of home directory values, user names, autogenerated values for gnome session tokens and such. Despite those changes, the problem consists. Another wild guess of mine was that the code.meteorcode folder has gone evil on me. So, Ive removed it and reinstalled meteor. That didnt fix it either. Whatever the problem is, its pretty stubborn.p

Negative 17533 pAll Im trying to do is create 4 linked tables to 4 views in a sql database. 3 of them work fine, the other one gives me this error when I try to open it. It does take a long time to open it from sql mgmt studio almost 3 mins. Searching online I can only find where people suggest changing the timeout property from design view, but when I open the linked table in design view there is no timeout property to be found. I can only see that when I open an actual query. I have already increased the timeout property in the registry for QueryTimeout to 5mins, yet I still get the timeout error after 60 secs.

Negative 17533 pScenario  I want to implement an MSMQ in which users input message through System.Messaging APIs. And there should be a listener which always observes this queue so when ever there is a message in queue I want to make a database updation.p  pMy first approach was to implement MSMQ trigger.  I was able to implement a COM interop dll trigger. But I wasnt able to do database operation and I couldnt figure out what was wrong, I tried a lot . Then I came to know about this WCF MSMQ binding. As I am new to this WCF I have some doubts.p  pWhich is the best approach to host WCF for this case. Is it IIS with WAS or Windows servicep  pAnd for this kind of listener service is a client necessary or can we write the database operations directly under the Service host operations without client invocationp

Negative 17533 pYou know how in the Settings app in iOS, you can select an setting from a codeUITableViewcode of settings, and the footer of the codeUITableViewSectioncode in which the setting cells are in will change. Like when you access your apps Allow Location Access settings, when you switch between Never, While Using App, or Always, the text below the settings changes. In my app, I would like to achieve a similar function. I have tried reloadSection, and I have implemented codetableViewtitleForFooterInSectioncode, but when I call codereloadSectioncode it hides my codeUITableViewSectioncode completely. So how do you access the footer of a codeUITableViewSectioncode of a codestaticcode codeUITableViewcode and change it without hiding the whole thing Thanks.p

Negative 17533 pI have an issue where our website will only support Internet Explorer version 9 and above.

Any other parallelism method to make the entire task faster p  pI am also trying to use MAP REDUCE to achieve the same, though I am not sure if that is a valid use case.p  pThe above observation was based on a local machine. When I tested it on a relatively powerful box, the connections were very less as compared to max number. I am running 5 instances of this process on same machine looking at a range of 10000 ids total 50K processed by resultset. Still I have 17 connections and max allowed are 500. But it takes a lot of time to finish as such and CPU usage shoots to 99. So need some tweaking to make it run faster or distribute to other machines. p

Also the success message shows up where it is supposed to, but the users name does not move until I reload the page.p  pHow can I get all of this to work without reloading the page   p  precodeif numrows           whilerow  mysqlifetchassocrun             ifrow[status]  Pending                  pendingid         row[id]                 pendinguserid    row[userid]                 pendingfirstname  row[firstname]                 pendinglastname   row[lastname]                 pendingusername   row[username]                 pendingemail   row[email] gt         ltform action methodPOST idstatusgt              ltinput typehidden nameid valueltphp echo pendingid gt idpendingidgt ltphp         if pendingfirstname  true              echo Name  . pendingfirstname .   . pendinglastname . ltbrgt .

Negative 17533 pIm working on an existing project consisting of a java GCM server, an android client both working perfectly and an iOS swift client which is my work in progress.p  pIve been following the google guide about setting up a client for iOS this a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comcloudmessagingiosclient relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comcloudmessagingiosclienta and successfully managed top  ul lipretrieve a device token from APNSpli lipsend that token to Google GCM servers to get a registration IDpli lipsend that registration ID to my GCM server for it to be stored and used later.pli lipserver side, Im apparently able to use that registration ID to send messagespli ul  pSadly, not a single message sent to that registration ID will be received by my client.p  pSo I looked into the android client code and I found that it uses a different senderID.. tried that and got a HttpError 401 from google servers.p  pSo heres my questionsp  ul lipis the senderID an ID of a strongGooglestrong server who will redirect messages to me Or is it an ID of strongMYstrong app serverpli lipwhen they say the senderID is the project number you get when registering your project on the google console do they mean the app server project Im asking this because when I registered my iOS client I got a server api key which I ignored along with that one apparently working senderID the one I used to get a registration token to send to my server. So I believe in that case I might be missing my servers id.pli lipcan the problem be the fact that my servers sends a data only message I mean, it does not contain notification payload so maybe no one of my AppDelegates didReceiveRemoteNotification is ever called for this reason. Should I implement another methodprotocol pli ul  pIm quite desperate, I dont find this clarified anywhere and chances are Im simply missing something obvious, even though my AppDelegate is like a copypaste of the guides example by that I mean I start GCMService, I successfully connect to it and everything that was done in the guides example. Thanks in advance for any suggestion.p

Why While PHP got 2x faster.strongp  pWhat is the reason for such a dramatic slowdown with new version of Node Does it make any difference that new version of Node I tried was not installed, ie in usrbinnode I just extracted the archive to home dir and added node to PATH Could that somehow affect the speed of execution Both home dir and usrbinnode are on the same drive, same partition, same user.p  h1So, Im back to original questionh1  pstrongAm I doing something wrong with Node and Sqlite3 herestrong Or its normal that PHP in this use case outperforms Node by order of magnitudep
