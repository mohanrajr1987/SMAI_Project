Positive 173 pI started writing an application and I am facing trouble with the databinding of an observablecollection, because I am not very familiar with WPF an Binding. Further the different method of binding like object binding, xaml binding are confusing me. p  pThe idea is to retrieve data from a SQL statement and add them to a observablecollection. Afterwards textboxescomboboxes which are located in a tab in the mainwindows should be updated with this data.p  pI have a SQL Class which is retrieving the data from a sqlserver and populating the observablecollection.

Positive 173 pi have a main window that contains multiple UserControls, arranged as tab pages and tab groups much like Visual Studio allows to have two or more editors visible at the same time. p  pI also have the possibility to open such an UserControl into a seperate floating window.p  pOne of these UserControls contains simple form fields e.g. text boxes. These text boxes are bounded with common databinding to an object  property. The binding mode is OnValidation not on OnPropertyChanged. p  pWhen I switch the focus from this User Control inside the main window into another UserControl in the Main windows, the validation is automatically performed and the databinding is finised  the changed text will be set on the model object  property that is bounded to that text field.p  pBut if I switch the focus to an UserControl which resides in another floating window, the databinding is not finished since no validation is performed.p  pI know that I can handle this manually by triggering ValidateChildren etc, but this seems to my the wrong way  is ugly. p  pIs there a correct  clean way to solve this issue I want that the validation is performed as soon as the UserControl loses its focus or the window gets deactivated. p  pOne information On of my UserControls contains a TreeControl. If I edit a tree node label, and when I switch the focus to another foating window, the label edit is finished automatically. I want the corresponding behaviour for usual form fields regarding binding...p  pThanks for helpp

Positive 173 pIm currently learning about Embers new datadown, actionsup paradigm for components. As discussed a hrefhttpemberjs.comblog20150510runuptotwooh.html relnofollowherea, however, sometimes I want to allow the child component to modify the property explicitly. This is where the emmutem helper comes in it creates a wrapper for the passed in value, containing a readonly value and a function to update it. The example on that page is for a simple button which increments a counter.p  pHow does this concept work if Im using the input helper inside a component For example, lets say Im building a form which consists of a bunch of special form componentsp  precode templatesindex.hbs ltformgt     formcontrol valuemut model.firstValue     formcontrol valuemut model.secondValue ltformgt codepre  pIf the emformcontrolem component just has the task of wrapping the input control, how do we use the passedin emmutem object correctly Is it something likep  precode templatescomponentsformcontrol.hbs input typetext valueattrs.value.value inputattrs.value.update codepre  pMy thinking here the value of the input element is set to the value of the emmutem object, and whenever the input value changes HTML5 input event the update method of the emmutem object is called to set the model property to the new value. It seems theres something wrong with my thinking though, because this doesnt work. What is the standard way of doing this now Im using Ember 1.13.8.p

In the example given its incrementing this value by 1 every second.p  pId expect the bound item on my form to reflect this change by updating its value accordingly, however it never updates.p  pFrom reading other responses to similar questions on StackOverflow Ive a feeling this is due to the nature of the main UI thread running separately to the thread which is causing the increment.p  pIm banging my head against a wall though trying to get this binding to update with each call of my DispatcherTimer.p  pThe following is the form element Im wanting to update every secondp  precodeltTextBox TextBinding val Width100gt codepre  pNext, this is the instantiation of the class containing the timer and my applications configurationp  precodeBasicTimer basictimer public MainWindow    InitializeComponent   basictimer  new BasicTimer   DataContext  basictimer  codepre  pLastly, heres the class Ive created.

Positive 173 pI know this question is a lot like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3340192datagridviewboundtobindinglistdoesnotrefreshwhenvaluechangedthis other onea, but still I cant figure out the answer.p  pThing is, my class emdoesem implement INotifyPropertyChanged, and my grid emdoesem update... just not right away.  The values kindof update in bursts instead of real time as each one changes.  The bursts are about 3 seconds apart, at which time a whole bunch of values update at the same time.  Id like the grid cells to reflect the value updates immediately, and not in batches.  Its as if the grid is trying to improve performance by withholding a lot of individual changes in favour of waiting for a bunch of changes to accumulate before reflecting them in the UI.p  pMy specific binding scenariop  ul liWinformsli liDataGridViewli ligrid DataSource is a BindingSourceli liBindingSources source is SortableBindingList of MyClassli liSortableBindingList inherits BindingList of Tli liMyClass implements INotifyPropertyChangedli liBackgroundWorker threads make changes to individual properties of list items, with 5 threads running at one timeli ul  pUpdatep  pThe answer is essentially this a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms171728.aspx relnofollowhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms171728.aspxap  pHowever, as this is a pet project with me as its end user, I dont feel like going to this length right now, so Ive just caught the exceptions, and will put up with the slightly inconsistent grid update behaviour.  At least I see why its happening.p

Positive 173 pI want my UI that is basically purely built on databinding to refresh when I call codeClearChangecode or codeRefreshRefreshMode.OverwriteChangesFromStore,objcode. However it looks like the backing fields are used directly by DataAccess instead of the properties they are backing as the setters are not accessed yet the objects properties do indeed get reverted back.p  pIs there a way to tell DataAccess to use the properties instead so codePropertyChangedcode is called within the setterp  pPossibly any other solution Nothing efficient comes to my mind p

Most of the Items work, except the dynamic column part. I put the Proxy inside the  section but it seems, that this is not working because no dynamic columns are shown I guess Data.SuggestionsViewDynamicColumnSelector is not found because of a missing DataContext.

Im trying to get CXFs DOSGi 1.1SNAPSHOT with Zookeeper discovery onto FUSE 4.1.0.2.  Im also using Zookeepr 3.2.1.  p  pEverything works perfectly on Felix 2.0.0.  I just follow the instructions on the a hrefhttpcxf.apache.orgdosgidiscovery.html relnofollowDOSGi Discoverya  page and then install the a hrefhttpcxf.apache.orgdosgidiscoverydemopage.html relnofollowDiscovery Demoa bundles.  For DOSGi, I just use the a hrefhttpsrepository.apache.orgcontentgroupssnapshotsorgapachecxfdosgicxfdosgirisinglebundledistribution1.1SNAPSHOTcxfdosgirisinglebundledistribution1.1SNAPSHOT.jar relnofollowcxfdosgirisinglebundledistribution1.1SNAPSHOT.jara for DSW and  a hrefhttpsrepository.apache.orgcontentgroupssnapshotsorgapachecxfdosgicxfdosgiridiscoverysinglebundledistribution1.1SNAPSHOTcxfdosgiridiscoverysinglebundledistribution1.1SNAPSHOT.jar relnofollowcxfdosgiridiscoverysinglebundledistribution1.1SNAPSHOT.jara  for zookeepr discovery.  Then when I start the sample bundles with the sample service impl on one machine, I see the node creation in zookeeper.  Then I start the sample client on another machine and I see the output on the service machine.  Works great.  I do have an warning about an xml error being ignored because some XSD coudlnt be found, but it doesnt seem to affect anything. Oh, I also have to install the OSGi compendium bundle first.p  pWhen I move to Fuse, I have no such luck.  The OSGi compendium bundle comes with fuse, so no need to install that.  I should just be able to install the dosgiri singlebundle, and the dosgiridiscovery single bundle, but that doesnt work.  The dosgiri singlebundle has all kinds of overlapping bundles with servicemix.  I get an error about port 8081 or whatever the osgi.http.service parameter is, being already in use.  Apparently the dosgiri singlebundle comes with pax webservice, which reads the same property as the servicemix http service bundle that comes with servicemix.  Thats when I switch to the  a hrefhttpsrepository.apache.orgcontentgroupssnapshotsorgapachecxfdosgicxfdosgirimultibundledistribution1.1SNAPSHOTcxfdosgirimultibundledistribution1.1SNAPSHOT.zip relnofollowcxfdosgirimultibundledistribution1.1SNAPSHOT.zipa and unzip it to take the parts I want.  I take the dsw bundle out of the dosgiri multibundle and install that.  No luck because of the jdom dependency.  Then I install the jdom that comes in the ri multibundle, which works fine.  Then go back to dsw, and that installs, so I think im getting somewhere.  Time to go back and install the ridiscovery singlebundle.  When I start that I get a pax logging service classcastexception saying it cant be cast to a osgi logservice or something.  But thats just a logging error, and at the bottom it says it cant find the transport class for a hrefhttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgsoaphttp relnofollowhttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgsoaphttpa.  Ok, so logging is screwed up and Im missing some transport class.  Well, clearly this comes from not installing enough from the ri multibundle because it worked on felix.  So what else in there is necessary.  The cxfminimalbundle upon inspection has the missing class causing that last error.  So I install that.  Try to start the discovery bundle, but I end up with some kind of corbabroker exception.  Wtf.  Whose using corba in all of this  Then I go back and undo all of that and try to stick with the singlebundle distros of ri and ridiscovery, but just turn off the servicemix http service.  That crashes servicemix and I cant restart it becauuse the cxf jbi components end up with an unsatisfied dependency.  Odd.  Ill just ignore that because I dont use those anyway, and try to start my samples.  Cant start the samples because it says jetty cant start because the ports already in use.  Doesnt make sense because I shutdown the servicemix http service already. Then I restart jetty.  Works  Maybe.  My service gets registered and I can browse to the wsdl using firefox, but no registration in zookeeper.  Try to shutdown the ridiscovery bundle and restart it, but I get a nullpointerexception.  Appparently the ridiscovery never actually started up due to one of the aforementioned errors.  Then I started trying to take apart the ridiscovery singlebundle and pull out the internals.  That didnt work because its all apparently necessary, even though theres some libs inside we could do without.p  pEnd of the story.  Cant get it to work.  Can anybody else get it to work  I just want to run the discovery samples in SMX4.  Im pretty sure its just a bundle conflict problem.  Isnt this what OSGi is supposed to fix  This is worse than just telling me what jars you depend on and making me setup my classpath.  At least then Id eventually get the thing running.p  pMy next steps, I think, will be to try again with the rimultibundle, just the dsw and jdom, plus the ridiscovery singlebundle.  Then Ill try some of the cxffuse bundles or some of the cxfrt bundles to get around the soap transport issue.p  pEdit notes  I need more than just showing the DOSGi bundles in an Active state.  They dont actually do much until you try to expose a service through them.  I do need to see multiple machines registering services with a zookeeper instance and other machines consuming those services  just like the running DOSGi Discovery Sample.  p  pIve been able to get cxf to expose the distributed service sample as a soap webservice by using the minimal cxf bundle mentioned by either removing parts of the original cxf bundles and restarting the jetty service, and then starting the sample service... or by installing the cxf minimal buundle, then starting my service, then immediately uninstalling the cxf minimal bundle, then restarting jetty... I think that was the order.  Neither of these will work from a clean startup, and having to restart services as a procedure to get DOSGi working is just bad.  I dont even know why installing then uninstalling would do anything  it shouldnt be leaving any artifacts around.p
Negative 173 pI have a picklist web interface a pair of select elements with a pair of buttons a leftpointing arrow and a rightpointing arrow between them.  Users can move items between the two columns by, eg, selecting one of options in the left column and clicking on the rightpointing arrow.p  pNow I have an enhancement request someone wants to be able to draganddrop items between the two columns instead of clicking a button.  The problem with my initial twoselectbox setup is that as soon as I click one of the highlighted options to initiate a drag, all of the other selected options are deselected.  Using jQuery, Ive attached mousedown event handlers to both the select boxes and each individual option that just call preventDefault on the event object, but this isnt sufficient.  On Firefox 3 the clickedon option loses focus immediately, but all other options are still deseleted, and on IE6 which I regrettably still have to support it makes no difference at all.p  pSo I thought I could maybe create a reasonable facsimile of a select box using list elements or divs or something.  I can create something reasonablelooking that works on Firefox, but on IE6, if I shiftclick on an element of my pseudoselect object in order to select a range of options, IE selects all of the text between where I click and the last place I clicked.  Again, Ive attached preventDefaulting mousedown, mouseup, and click handlers to all of the elements involved, but it doesnt help.p  pIve even tried overlaying transparent divs over both my original select boxes and my pseudoselect objects, thinking to intercept mouse clicks and manage the selections manually, but I cant make it work on IE.  If I use a select box, I cant prevent clicks from changing the selection, and if I use text that just looks like a select element, I cant prevent it from selecting a range of text on a shiftclick.p  pIs there some general solution, or am I just out of luckp

Negative 173 pI have a selfhosted WCF service and Im having the following problem 15 minutes after creating the instance of the service TryEnter calls in operation contract methods constantly return false, but the TryEnter calls in Main function, which also uses synchronization via Monitor class, return true.p  pHeres the description of my app and the bug I am developing a selfhosted WCF service in Visual Studio 2008 C in Windows XP SP2. The ServiceHost instance of the host is created at the beginning of the Main function. The Main function runs a while true loop during which it performs periodic readings, writing, maintenance etc. There is a static collection of objects which can be added or removed over time, which act as containers for worker threads. Some of these threads do periodic work requested by Main function, while others perform ondemand reading and writing to a remote device.  Synchronization locking is done on these objects using Monitor class TryEnter and Exit methods. These objects are also accessed through the service contract methods services using the same functions. Synchronization is done between the Main function and the service methods. When the instance of the service is created, it runs with designed performance for exactly 15 minutes, after which every TryEnterobj, timeout call made from the service returns false after the specified timeout expires. This however doesnt affect the TryEnter calls made in the Main function i.e. they always return true. I have tried changing the settings for InstanceContextMode, ConcurrencyMode, coupled with service throttling attributes maxConcurrentCalls1  maxConcurrentSessions5 and every configuration gave the same effect. The service becomes responsive again when I restart the host app, but not when I forcibly close and reopen the host while the app is running the service instance remains in the memory. It is not a case of service being unavailable, as in the call never making its way to the service instance. The method is called, its execution comes to the TryEnter call which precedes the critical section of the method and TryEnter just returns false after the timeout 15 seconds. I have checked and double checked the pairings of TryEnter and Exit  the methods always release the lock when the critical section ends. Other contract operations which dont use locking or the objects in question work fine even after the 15 minute period has ended.p  pThank you all in advance. Happy holidaysp

Negative 173 pI need some PHP code to convert some PHP into JS.p  ul lifunctionality  Im using common PHP functions from a hrefhttpphpjs.org relnofollowphp.jsali lisyntax  li ul  pThe issue is converting the syntax. I dont need full PHP syntax, mind you no need for supporting class definitionsdeclarations. Heres a small checklist of what needs conversionp  ul li. should be  string concatli li should be . object operatorli li should be . class operator  not really requiredli ul  pPlease note that the resulting code is pretty much independent of the PHP environment, so no what if it uses a PHP class.p  pIm not asking for full code, just a tip on the right direction to this kind of conversion I was thinking about employing a state machineengine.p  pIf youre curious as to why Im pushing code to the user side I need a dynamic way to change visibility of certain elements given certain conditions. My plan is to do this without having to execute this code server side and having unnecessary ajax calls.p  pstrongEditstrong Look people. I know not using AJAX sounds ludicrous to you but the world doesnt work on hype and nicesounding design conditions ajax. I simply cant afford each single user polling my server 5 to 10 times per second just for my server to return a yes or no answer. Keep in mind that switching is asynchronous, and I cant buffer the AJAX calls.p  pstrongEdit 2strong I am sure what Im doing is the best way in my situation. There is no possibly better way, so quit posting nonconstructive comments. I cant get into any more detail than I have so already. The conversion from PHP code to JS is simply a matter of shortening user input we only need one expression, then convert it to whichever language is necessary in this particular case, from PHP to JS. The conditions on how this works will emnot changeem regardless if I describe the system down to the API specs, and inundating the topic with useless for you prototype docs will not help at all.p  pAlso, for those thinking this idea came after waking up form some dream know this has been reviewed between technical development and QA, so please do not deviate into inexistent design issues.p  pstrongEdit 3strong Examples original PHP code and expected outputp  ul lioriginal    convertedli licode5testcode    code5testcodeli licode.func1210code    codefunc1210codeli licodeFieldscount5code    codeFields.count5codeli licodethisgtid5code    codethis.id5codeli ul  pAbout the last example, dont worry about contextscope, it is correct. Also note that the expressions may look weird this is because they emareem expression a single line of code that must return a value, which explains the absence of an EOL  and the multiple use of returning a boolean value. exotic stuff like backtick operator execution, PHP tags, echo, die, list, etc.. left out on purposep
Negative 173 pIve downloaded the ZIP archive of PHP and extracted it under my profile.

Negative 173 pWeve created a Crystal Report viewer application to house all of our company reports. Its built in such a way that any time we add, modify or delete a report, the viewer application itself does not need to change. The viewer app is completely driven by an XML configure file that tells it what reports are available, where they are, connection information etc. We want to keep it this way too. When we add a new report, we dont want to have to update everyones viewer application. p  pThe problem is that Crystal talks to our DB directly and we would prefer it didnt. Therefore, for each report, the viewer needs to query the database to retrieve the data each report needs. The problem is that many of our reports allow the user to enter a large number of filter criteria. Ideally, what we would like to be able to do is to have Crystal prompt the user to enter their filter criteria, like it currently does, and then be able to somehow get the SQL statement it would send on to the DB, pass it on to the DB ourselves, and tell Crystal not to. the viewer would then supply the report with data.p  pDoes anyone know if this can be done An alternative weve considered is to have the viewer prompt the user for the filter criteria, and then build the SQL statement. However, then each report becomes a C coding project with an update to the viewer. Were trying to avoid that.p  pThanks.p

Negative 173 pIf Im creating a new project in unmanaged C, Visual Studio 2008 or greater, which exception handling model do I want to go withp  pI understand that EHa option results in less efficient code, and also catches SEH exceptions, rightp  pSo I have been steering clear of that option and typically going with EHsc, so that Im only catching C exceptions that are actually thrown and not catching access violations and other structured execptions, in catch... handlers. If there is an access violation in my code, I dont want it being masked by a catch... .p  pI code with others who want catch...  to do nothing and they even want it to do it if there is an access violation, which seems like a really bad idea to me. If there is a bug due to bad coding, you dont want to stick your fingers in your ears and loudly say La la la la la so that you dont have to have the program crash In fact, if the code is now in a bad state because of a coding error, do you really want the code to continuep  pSo my general thought is that EHa creates largerslower code and it allows programmers to get away with writing code that if a fatal bug is present, it will continue to run in an undefined state.p  pBTW, Im talking about applications and service code which is what we are writing for the most part. Not low level device drivers or anything like that.p  pPlease weigh in with your thoughts.p

Negative 173 pI learned my app does not behave well on multitasking iOS in case a certain ViewController was active when quitting the app. This view controller needs to gather recent information in order to display it. So far initialization code for gathering this information was only placed in viewWillAppear.p  pNow Ive learned viewWillAppear will not be called when the view will appear from background. p  pSince the world may have changed since the app was send to the background, the view controller needs to reinitialize. I understand I may register for UIApplicationWillEnterForegroundNotification. However, this fires every time the app comes back to the foreground, no matter whether the user is currently navigating to this particular viewController. p  pDo you have a pattern how to make use of UIApplicationWillEnterForegroundNotification only when the ViewController is active in the sense of will appear shortly p

Negative 173 pIn an application I am working on, a requirement is to do massive set intersection, to the tune of 101,000,000 items or so.  The items that we are intersecting are simply ObjectIds.p  pSo for instance there is a boxes document and inside the boxes document there is an itemids Array.  This itemids array for each box holds 101,000,000 ObjectIds.p  pThe end goal here is to say, given box A with ObjectId 4d3dc3898951498107000005, and box B with ObjectId 4d3dc3898951498107000002, which itemids do they have in commonp  pHere is how im doing itp  precodedb.boxes.distinctitemids, id  in  [ObjectId4d3dc3898951498107000005, ObjectId4d3dc3898951498107000002] codepre  pFirstly just curious if this seems like a sane approach.

This appears to also work with .limit and .skip to effectively implement a paging of the data set.p  pAnyhow, any feedback is valuable, thanksp

Negative 173 pMost people are asking about migrating from J2ME to Android. Im not. Id like to develop applications and have them work on both Android and J2ME. Obviously for each application I will have an Android project and a J2ME project and both will source in a shared dependent project that will have common code.p  pId like to know what do people think the right design approach should be to  maximize code reuse maximize the code in the shared project.p  pIn my typical J2ME application there is a controllermodel and a bunch of views.br So each view holds a reference to the controller and when the user interacts with the view, the view invokes a method of the controller and the controller decides which view should be displayed next and what data it should have in it. The views dont know about each other. I would expect the controllermodel code should be mostly reusable if written properly. p  pThe question is How does this 1 controller to many views translate to Android where each activity performs a subset of the whole application p  pOne approach would be to have a single activity the controller code in it.br That means the application would have to handle Back as it would anyway for J2ME.br It also means that when codeonAddContextMenucode is called it would have to know which kind of page is currently being displayed to add the page specific context menu.p  pAnother approach would be the following each application view becomes an activity and the modelcontroller is passed around from one activity to another.p  pAny opinions which is better other approachesp

Negative 173 pI am in the process of designing my data access code, the data is going to be stored in RavenDB, and I am trying to see if my current design has too much abstraction with the number of interfaces I am going to have.p  pI am going to have DTOs that will just hold the data and then I am going to have Entity or Model, Business, or whatever you call them objects that will have extra functionality.  I am also going to have an interface per entity defining what data it needs to have.  So for examplep  precodeinterface IUser      string Id  get      string Username  get      string Password  get      bool ResetPassword  get    class UserDTO  IUser      public string Id  get set      public string Username  get set      public string Password  get set       public UserDTO              Id  null         Username  null         Password  null         ResetPassword  false        class User  IUser      public string Id  get set      public string Username  get set      public string Password  get set       public User              Id  null         Username  null         Password  null         ResetPassword  false           public UserIUser user              Id  user.Id         Username  user.Username         Password  user.Password         ResetPassword  user.ResetPassword           public ResetPassword              Id  null         Username  null         Password  null       codepre  pThe reason I want to have an interface for each entity is because I want to make sure the both codeEntityDTOcode and codeEntitycode have the required shared data.p  pNow for retrieving and saving the data, I am going to use the repository pattern.

For examplep  precodeinterface IDataRepositoryltTgt      bool SaveT entity     bool DeleteT entity   interface IUserRepository  IDataRepositoryltIUsergt      IUser Loadstring key     IUser LoadByLoginstring username, string password   class UserRepository  IUserRepository      bool SaveT entity              save code           bool DeleteT entity              delete code           IUser Loadstring key              load code           IUser LoadByLoginstring username, string password              load code       codepre  pThe reason I want to have a repository interface for each entity is so that I can if I need to use different data storage options for different entities.p  pDo this seem like too much abstractionp

Richard Stevensp  pAnd about this code book saysp  blockquote   pIf the signal is sent to the process while it is blocked, the signal delivery will be deferred until the signal is unblocked. To the application, this can look as if the signal occurs between the unblocking and the pause depending on how the kernel implements signals. If this happens, or if the signal does occur between the unblocking and the pause, we have a problem. Any occurrence of the signal in this window of time is lost in the sense that we might not see the signal again, in which case the pause  will block indefinitely. This is another problem with the earlier unreliable signals.p blockquote  pAnd it recommands to use codesigsuspendcode before resetting signal mask instead of codepausecode since it resets the signal mask and put the process to sleep in a single atomic operation.

Negative 173 pIm trying to build a forum that consists of three tables. A forum table, a topic table, and a posts table.p  pOn the page displaying all the forums I would like it to show the number of topics for each forum, and the number of posts in that forum. Pretty standard stuff. Im having some trouble with the MySQL query however. This is what Im usingp  precodeSELECT f. , COUNTt.topicid AS topics, COUNTp.postid AS posts FROM forums AS f LEFT JOIN forumstopics AS t ON f.forum  t.forumid LEFT JOIN forumsposts AS p ON t.topicid  p.topicid GROUP BY f.forum codepre  pThis will return one row for each forum, however the topic count and posts counts return equal to each other. The post count is correct, so the problem is in the topic count.p  pThe tables are structured with forumsposts contains the id number of the topic it belongs to, it does not contain the id number of the forum it belongs to. The forumstopics table contains the id number of the forum it belongs to.p  pHow can my query be corrected Would it be better if I added the forumid a post belongs to in the forumsposts tablep  pThank you for your advice.p

Negative 173 pI have a working application which relies on several static libraries, which Ive added as dependencies to the application and added to the link with static libraries bit in build phases. Everything builds and runs fine in the simulator and on my attached iPad.p  pI wanted to create an .ipa for use with test flight so I followed the instructions on test flights site httpsupport.testflightapp.comkbtutorialshowtocreateanipaxcode4 and some other tutorials relating to creating an archive with an app that uses static libraries httpdiaryofacodemonkey.ruprect.com20110318adhocappdistributionwithxcode4, a hrefhttpwww.musicalgeometry.comp1237httpwww.musicalgeometry.comp1237a.p  pFollowing these tutorials, when I create an archive I get linker errors about not being able to find various libraries, for example ld library not found for lOAuthTouchp  pIve also tried using a new project and a new static library project to make sure its not some setting Ive changed and I get the same problem.p  pThis seems to be because I added a build configuration called Ad Hoc to my app for creating an archive, and based on the linker command and the fact that adding an Ad Hoc configuration to all the static libraries I use allows the archive to be created Im assuming that the static libraries are being built to a different directory.p  pId rather not have to add a new build configuration to all the libraries I use, so my question is, what should I do to create an archive of my app without tinkering with every library I usep  pA second related question all the tutorials I mentioned say to set the Skip install build setting to yes for static libraries, but the Apple documentation httpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationToolsLanguagesConceptualXcode4UserGuideDistAppsDistApps.html seems to indicate setting it for the application, rather than the libraries. Anyone know which is rightp

Also i prefer not to have using namespace whatever but then it makes the bind expression needlessly verbose eg. 1 becomes stdplaceholders1, and lambda avoids this issue.p  pFinally i should note that for the purposes of this question, somemethod is a big function that does lots of things, and would be a pain to directly copy into a lambda body.p  pIf this question seems too vague, then we can focus on answers to the performance differences, if any.p  pEDIT A nontrivial use case.p  precodeMyClassMyClass     somemember CALLBACKFUNCTOR   codepre  pAs you can see, the CALLBACKFUNCTOR used in an initializer list defined with approach 1 or 2 makes it difficult to scope a using declaration afaik, and obviously we wouldnt bother wrapping a member method that we intended to call straight away.p

Negative 173 pI have a simple WCF service using ws2007HttpBinding which puts in a configurable delay, then returns. The service is configured to be PerCall. The service is hosted on IIS 7.5 on Windoes 2008 Server R2 SP1p  pI am call this asynchronously via console app using an imported service reference.p  pI can easily inject 10000 requests and they are all successful. Each request uses a new WCF proxy. The CPU was running about 70p  pI wanted to see if adding another worker process would help throughput and utilise the full 100 cpu. I configured it to have 2 worker processes.p  pWhen I ran this it began to fail virtually immediately with a MessageSecurityException. Even if I set the number of requsts to 10, it still fails. I noticed that it fails more if the timer in the WCF service is short  between 10 and 50 ms. A higher delay causes less failures.p  pIt either fails on the proxy.Open or proxy.Closep  pI investigated this and thought it might be related to secure conversation.

Negative 173 pIve decided I have to write my own syntax highlighter. So far its working but its realtime you type, it highlights and its slow.p  pIll try to explain how it works. Each time the user types something into the EditText it runs the highlighter via TextWatcher. The highlighter searches through the text until it finds the beginning of a word and then searches until it finds the end of the same word. Once it finds a word it searches through an array of keywords, if it finds a match it sets a spannable at that location. It keeps looping until it reaches the end of the document.p  pAgain, it works so far just trying out this idea before I continue with this method, but its so slow. Some times it can take over a second just to go through a few lines. It slows down how fast the text appears in the EditText.

Negative 173 pThis has bugged our whole team for over a day now. We moved a DotNetNuke 6 application to a loadbalanced system ARR server, currently one web server behind it, web application on a fileshare.p  pSince the move, we see very frequent application pool recycles every two or three minutes. We dont see them in the event viewer why not theyre configured to log all recycles, but we see the codeApplicationStartcode events as logged by DNN, and of course extreme performance degradation.p  pIf not a configuration change, what could cause this kind of behaviorp

Negative 173 pIm new to Macs and iOS, I got my app running on webOS, Android, and WPFWindows. In all cases the size of, say, a widget to display a bunch of text, can change depending on the dimension of the text to be displayed, as well as the position can be up against another widget. As the text size changes, the position will change so that all the widgets are crammed together nicely.p  pIve been searching for this capability in IOS4 in books and online, and its starting to look like in iOS, you have to actually calculate the size of the text to be displayed in ViewText and then change the dimensions of ViewText, which of course then bumps other Views around to accommodate this size change. It sounds like a nightmare. Isnt there some other way to do this like all the other GUIs can do to size based on content, and to position relative to other Views like stacking them all together whatever size they arep  pSame with ScrollView, it looks like the size of the window you actually see has to be manually specified as well, instead of, say, taking up the entire viewable window and then you can populate the ScrollView with a bunch of subviews, some of which are below the initially viewable area I tried this in Xcode4, but so far, havent gotten it to work.p  pSimilarly with creating an object with a NIB and instantiating that NIB onto an existing View, how does it determine where to position this NIB onto the existing screenp  pThanksp

The client is a large company with many divisions, and each division has their own networking structure.p  pI wont go into the details, but because of my companys internal structure for web servers, we cant use the conventional allow,deny syntax in Apache.

Instead, we use something like the following in our Apache configurationsp  precodeRewriteCond HTTPXForwardedFor 213.212.45.54 codepre  pWe make use of the XForwardedFor header to match external IPs. The problem is that one of our clients divisions call it division A has their Internet setup to go through an internal proxy.

In other words isnt each list item of type TimeZoneInfo If so why doesnt the qdx assignment not work I get back a 1 which means it couldnt find the timezone object in the combobox but it can find it in the tzCollection.

It works now because I think there is a onetoone mapping from tzCollection to the cbo items.

Negative 173 pIs there a module that I could use for playing back an audio file in python More specifically, I would like to have something where I can set the start and end positions of the playback.

Negative 173 pI am very new at programming WCF services, so I hope that if you answer my question  you will take that into account and explain it to me as if I was a kid wcf services for dummies  .

I have already generated the assemble but now my question how do you dynamically assign properties for the classes that dont know what properties exist in there What I mean is how do I know that a class is using list of objects of another class when creating generic solution. So instead of hardcoding the classnames and propertynames is there a way to get instances and properties. As you see from the above snippet I am assigning the values from the a dataset to the properties. The plan is to store the values in the database as columnname, attributename and parentnode. So PName attribute in P node will come from column name Pname. I want the design in such a way that there will not be any hardcoding in my code. Can you please suggest me with some examples or design idea.p  pSorry please bear with me, please let me know if I am not making sense.p

Negative 173 pI want to ask about an edgecase scenario that I understand is very poor C programming form and, in all likelihood, should never be used in practice.

Here is sample code that most concisely demonstrates my questionp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  templatelttypename T1, typename T2gt class A  public     int foo              return 1        templatelttypename T1, typename T2gt class AltT2, T1gt  lt Arguments reversed in template specialization  public     int foo              return 2        int main      Altint, intgt a     stdcout ltlt a.foo  Output is 2 the specialized version is called.     return 0  codepre  pWhen I run this program, as noted, the output is 2 the specialized version of the template class is instantiated by the template compiler.p  pThinking about this, I believe that it is impossible, under any circumstances, to write code in which the emnonemspecialized version of the template class is emeverem instantiated by the template compiler.  Because the template compiler looks for a matching specialization first, and because the twoargument specialization will always match for any client code that instantiates type codeAltfirsttype, secondtypegtcode for which, in particular, codefirsttypecode corresponds to codeT2code in the syntax codetemplatelttypename T1, typename T2gtcode within the definition of the specialized template, it therefore seems true that the nonspecialized version cannot, under emanyem circumstances, be reached.p  pAm I correct  If not, can someone please demonstrate client code that uses template class A and is able to instantiate the nonspecialized version of the templatep

Negative 173 pBasically, I want to make this graph look prettier.  You can see there are areas of extreme overdraw.

Negative 173 pCurrently I am using msdeploy to build and deploy on several machines using teamcity. In my current scenario, I need to build, package and deploy on Dev. After this I need to deploy this package on test and Live servers which are on different domain. I understand how we do it but problem is Web transformation only occurs for test and live configs if we build a package. It means if I want to use the same package that is created for Dev cannot be used, as web transformation only occurred for Dev web config. Also know that we can change web config when unpackaging but that parameters are very limited. We have a lot of changes not just the connection string or db changes.  Another solution is to add another step to build packages for test and live as part of Dev deployment but then it means a lot of copying on remote servers, once for test and once for live which is a lot of time consuming due to different domains. p  pCan you please guide what is the best solution in this scenario. So I can use teamcity to publish to Dev and test and live using same package and different web configs in one go.p

I am doing this site as a favor for my cousin who is totally tech retarded, but is an artist so has very specific aesthetic expectations. I have just been hacking away without any idea what I am doing so if there is a better way to put images with links in that sidemenu area, I am all ears. It does not necessarily have to highlight when you hover, but that would be a nice touch.p  pIdeally Id like to add Facebook, Twitter and RSS buttons in the same grungy stamp style, but horizontally. Is that possible to fit all 3 buttons on one horizontal using custom menus as I have donep  pThanks.p

Negative 173 pMy project uses the Andrew File System AFS and Git revision control. I made a clone of the project repository in my sandbox, and have been working on a number of feature requests in their own dedicated local branch. p  pBefore pushing the changes to the main repository, I would like my 2 coworkers to review my changes, and hence, want to share my local branches with them. I searched on the internet and on SO for git sharing local branch with coworkers, but the most useful solutions suggested pushing changes to the main repository with a unique tag.p  pIs there any way a coworker could directly read my local branches, without requiring me to push to the main repository If not, is there some way to push all the branches in one go There are about 10 branches and I would like to avoid pushing them one by one, if possible. p  pMoreover, not all 10 branches are relevant to both my coworkers. Unlike this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7660106gitlocalbranchaccessibleforcoworkerGit local branch accessible for coworkera, I do not mind them accessing the branch shared with the other, but it seems cleaner to tell them which branches I would like them to look at. p  pNot sure if this is relevant, but they have AFS permissions read and lookup to my sandbox. Also, we do not work in the same location and there is a big timezone difference between us, so checking out one branch at a time for review will take way too long. p  pThanks for your consideration. p

Negative 173 pI have a MVC page that loads a Partial via a Ajax.ActionLink, which works, and then the loaded Partial contains a form that has Ajax.BeginForm.  This form is not getting wired up to unobtrusive ajax, and instead is performing a page refreshI verified this in the Network log of the browser that shows the initiator when I click submit is the browser instead of jquery.p  pWhat I believe is the issue is that since the form didnt exist when the page is loadedbut later is added via the Ajax.ActionLink, then unobtrusive ajax didnt see the dataajax attributes on the newly added form and wire up the necessary events.  Im assuming that only happens at document.ready, and the ajax form didnt exist then.p  pstrongIs there something I can do to say hey Unobstrusive Ajax, please look at my page again now that I have some new elements that are marked with dataajax and wire them upstrongp  pThanks.p  pLooking at the unobtrusive ajax source, it has thisp  precodeform[dataajaxtrue].livesubmit, function evt          var clickInfo  this.datadataclick  []         evt.preventDefault ... codepre  pThe form tag generated looks like thisp  precodeltform actionPathCreate classformhorizontal dataajaxtrue dataajaxmethodpost dataajaxmodereplace dataajaxupdateParentContainer idPathForm methodpost novalidatenovalidategt codepre  pAs far as I can tell the selector on the .live event should be picking up on the new form when its loaded onto the page.  The form is inside a bootstrap modal however, so I dont know if that would be preventing the event from bubbling up somehow.p  pI can even run this in Chrome consolep  precode form[dataajaxtrue].livesubmit, function evt              var clickInfo  this.datadataclick  []             evt.preventDefault  codepre  pAnd it returns the form element successfully, but when I click submit it still does a full page refresh.

Negative 173 pI am new to Qt. While I have installed 4.8.3 for long, I started writing my first Qt program yesterday. I am under windows environment, and use CodeBlocks for my C codes.p  pI followed the book on Qt programming, and tried to reproduce the book examples. Problem arose in the second chapter, when there was a need of separate compilation. I never had a successful separate compilation with CodeBlocks, and no exception this time I still received unknown reference to XXX.p  pI tried to find all instructions online but I still could not solve it set up qmake, linking etc. Especially when I used qmake and mark the makefile as custom one, whenever I compiled my program, CodeBlocks told me that the project hadnt been built when I clicked yes for building the program, the same hasnt been built notification popped out, and the process repeated.p  pI once suspected that something went wrong with my Qt, so I removed it and installed the latest one which is Qt5.0. But I could not use it because CodeBlocks only supports Qt4, and my compiler does not support Qt5.p  pSo I tried to download the old one, 4.8.4. Then it turned out that I could not even compile a onefile program I mean one .cpp file in the whole project, no selfdefined header. I tried the default CodeBlock qt program, which is like thisp  precode    include ltQApplicationgt     include ltQFontgt     include ltQPushButtongt      int mainint argc, char argv[]              QApplication appargc, argv         QPushButton quitQuit         quit.resize75, 30         quit.setFontQFontTimes, 18, QFontBold         QObjectconnectampquit, SIGNALclicked, ampapp, SLOTquit         quit.show         return app.exec      codepre  pJust a very standard one. It should compile, and it did, but things were even worse the program never works, as runtime error occurs right after it is executed error code 0xC0000005 or 1073741819 This is my problem 1 I have no clues, what can I do to solve the problem I do not mind deleting my CodeBlocks and Qt and doing the reinstallation if they work, but I have tried, and no use.p  pMy second problem this is solved Then I tried to use Qt Creator. When I compiled the simple program shown above, I received a lot of errors with keywords unwindresume  can anyone tell me how I can solve it Online comments suggest running qtvar.bat, but it didnt help some suggested building debug library, which I tried but accidentally stopped because of not enough memoryp  pMy third problem found it rather redundant because it is discussed above, so I have deleted itp  pI should say thanks first to people who really read my post. And I have to say that while information provided may not be sufficient for finding solution, this is all I know.p  pUpdate  Some more info actually I also had similar undefined reference for CodeBlocks. But I was lazy and so I just copied all the .dll files from the qt folder to the SysWOW64 programs did compile and run yesterday, but programs crashed with runtime error after I reinstalled qt and codeblocks today, even though I also copied the new .dll files. To make things clear Codeblocks can compile the program if I copy the .dll files to SysWOW64, but now the program crashes, unlike yesterday as the program ran normally.p  pUpdate  now the problem is runtime error.p

Negative 173 pWe went in production with our new SharePoint solution this week. After nearly a year in development and testing on a staging environment it is the first time Ive experienced the following error.p  pstrongThe error Sometimes it works, sometimes it crashes with a 404strongp  pWe are using Nintex workflow in our SharePoint solution  but I guess Nintex is not the deal breaker here. From this workflow and other workflows we are calling a custom asmx webservice that is hosted in the SharePoint farms vtibin. Everything inside the webservice runs with elevated privileges. When the workflow is calling the webservice, the webservice randomly returns for some users a 404 error The resource cannot be found. The missing resource here is the asmx path to the webservice. p  pThe interesting thing is that this error occurs only when one of our customers users is initiating the workflow, but not if one of our test logins is workflow initiator. The error is also only occurring 2 out of 5 test runs for the customers users. When using my test login for a test run I do experience such an error too sometimes, but only 3 times out of 20 tries. The error is occurring at another webservice call from the workflow  not the same call that crashes when a customers user is trying.p  pstrongThe environmentstrongp  pThe SharePoint environment consists of two web front ends and an application server. A load balancer is also operating. So my guess is that one of the machines in the environment isnt configured properly. When Im testing with our test users Im testing on workstations which are in the same network as the farms servers  Im doing this directly via a remote desktop connection and also my tests have to pass the load balancer. The customers users are testing the workflow under similar circumstances, but I believe theyre routed differently to the SharePoint farm so that they get onto another front end like I do when testing remote.p  pstrongWhat I already triedstrongp  ul liTesting the webservice directly without a workflow with my test users li liTesting the webservice directly without a workflow on each front endli liChecking if the asmx file is really in all vtibin folders on all machinesli ul  pConclusion The asmx exists everywhere and Ive never experienced a the ASP.NET specific 404 when calling the webservice manually.p  pstrongMy suspicionstrongp  pIt sometimes works, so I guess probably one front end is doing its job ok. When the workflow runs on the other faulty front end the problem raises  that would explain why my test user initiated workflows behave differently to the customer initiated.p  pOr could it be a permission problem I have tested calling the webservice manually from the vtibin with a test user that has absolutely no rights on the SharePoint farm and was able to call the webservice successfully. Or should I try to start the workflow with the System Accountp  pAre there any things I could try to narrow down the problem The staging system works still fine  same version, same users, no problems.p  pThanks in advance and happy holidaysp  pCheersp

Negative 173 pI havent used Swing before, so I was looking at the tutorial at br a hrefhttpwww.zetcode.comguijythonswinglayout relnofollowhttpwww.zetcode.comguijythonswinglayoutap  pAt the bottom, there is an example that uses GroupLayout to create a simple layout that resizes with the window.

Negative 173 pI tried looking around but was not able to convince myself with an answer as the world of COMActiveX seems to be very confusing.br Basically what I want to know is, given the GUID, is there a way to know all the interfaces, properties and methods exposed by an ActiveX control  I read somewhere that you just have to ask if a particular property is there or not. But how do I ask about a property before knowing what are therebr I guess IDispatch does something similar, but I am not able to make out how to use it. If this is the one that works, a small snippet, preferably in C would help me understand better.  p  pThanksp

Negative 173 pI am receiving XML data serially from an SSH2 connection in chunks of up to 16k. Every time I receive a chunk I simply pass it to the XMLParser module via the parsemore function. This works really well. I was investigating switching over to use a SAX parser but I cant find a parsemore function. All the examples Ive found use parseuri or parsestring. I was hoping parsestring was the equivelant of parsemore but it requires the entire string in memory, largely defeating the purpose of using SAX. Does anyone know how to process data in chunks with SAXp  pAs an aside does anyone find perl module documentation to be extremely poor In many cases they dont even at least list the available functions.p

Negative 173 pI am very new to JavaScript, and when working with my objects prototype I try to call the current object to extend a method but it is not working. So I googled my problem but didnt really get anywhere as it is practically impossible to phrase. However, I found the codethiscode keyword which I thought should work but didnt. Heres what I havep  precodefunction window, document, undefined       var myObj  function      not a noop     var ua  function  return navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase      function noop    empty noop function      myObj.prototype           constructor myObj,         renderizr              presto ua.matchoperaprestoi,             trident ua.matchtridenti,  dont parse msie as opera uses this sometimes             webkit ua.matchchromesafariwebkiti,             gecko ua.matchfirefoxgeckoi,  dont parse netscape as a lot of strings use this             val   keep empty for now                     renderizr.val extension      use this so the user can print the value of      the rendering engine instead of using multiple      conditional statements.         ifthis.renderizr.presto  this.renderizr.val  Presto          else ifthis.renderizr.trident  this.renderizr.val  Trident          else ifthis.renderizr.webkit  this.renderizr.val  Webkit          else ifthis.renderizr.gecko  this.renderizr.val  Gecko       window.myObj  new myObj  window, document  codepre  pThis way, you can do codealertmyObj.renderizr.valcode instead of doing monotonous conditional statements. p  pI dont want to do generic browser name detection because youre only supposed to test for the features which you need, not the browser. However, some rendering engines have different habits for rendering web pages, so I do want to include bengine detectionb in my script. However, I dont suggest using this, like I said, I just want to get to know javascript and how it works, and its not working.p  pSo my question is, what am I doing wrong here and how can I fix it Why doesnt the codethiscode keyword workp

Negative 173 pIm very new to using git, and previously havent really tried to organize any projects Ive worked on. I just recently purchased a development server for personal use, however, and I wanted to start organizing all my projects and using version control.p  pIve spent the past 8 hours researching different recommended methods for organizing files in a project, and I realize that its a very subjective matter. However Ive developed a system that I think will work for just about any cause for me and I have one very objective question in regards to how to accomplish a certain task with the directory structure.p  pPresently Im looking into a structure akin to the followingp  precodesrc  All deliverables in an uncompiled form PHP files, c source files, etc data  Crucial but unrelated data SQL databases, etc. lib  Dependencies  THIS IS WHERE MY QUESTION LIES docs  Documentation build  Scripts to aide in the build process test  Unit tests res  Not version controlled. Contains PSD files and nondiffable stuff .gitignore README output.zip  Readytoinstall finished product just unzip and go codepre  pAs I mentioned  my real issue revolves around this codelibcode directory. This needs to contain all files and programs which my project requires to run, but which are outside of the scope of my project and I wont be editing. Some features that I need this folder to havep  ul liSince these are needed for my final product to run, they must be included in output.zipli liI would like this folder to be version controlled so that anyone who downloads my git repository will have access to all dependenciesli liIf several projects have the same dependency, I do NOT want to have 18 redundant copies of the same file on my serverli liI would like to be able to pull these dependencies from other projects of mine one project should be able to serve as a library for a separate projectli ul  pI can avoid having 18 redundant copies of the same file by using a virtual directory symlink, however from my understanding git would copy this symlink asis into the repository without copying the files. Therefore if anyone else fetched my repository they would have a dangling pointer and no libraries.p  pAt first it looked like I could do what I wanted using a hrefhttpswww.kernel.orgpubsoftwarescmgitdocsgitsubmodule.html relnofollowgitsubmodulea. However from my understanding this takes the entire contents of another repository and treats it as a subdirectory. Therefore if I included dependency A my libraries folder would look something likep  precodelibAsrc libAdata ... libAtest .gitignore README output.zip codepre  pIn the case of a script PHP, Perl, etc. I could probably load the dependency using coderequirelibAsrcdependency.phpcode, but in the case of a DLL or binary file I would have no easy way to read the output file from output.zip. I could have the finished project stored directly at the root level instead of wrapped up in a pretty zip file, but if the project were, say, a website  this could mean hundreds of files cluttering up my repository root.p  pHow can I include another repository as a library of my own, easily reference the library files within my own project, have the library meaningfully copied to anyone who fetches my repository, and prevent redundant copies of the same files on my development serverp  pstrongEDITstrong After searching on Google for a while I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5461617usinggitandsubmodulewhatsagoodfolderstructurethis similar issuea, however it only addresses PHP projects. While an autoloader may allow you to mask the underlying file system in a PHP environment, how would you apply a similar approach to a C project Or a Python project Or a Java projectp  pAs I thought more about this project today a few other thoughts came to mind which may require a new direction of thought. First is the problem of very deep library nests. If project A depends on project B which depends on project C which depends on project D then you would have a directory structure like sop  precodeAlib AlibB AlibBlib AlibBlibC AlibBlibClib AlibBlibClibD codepre  pObviously this would not only get annoying, but redundant in its own way.p  pHow do normal people deal with dependencies when doing a git repositoryp

Negative 173 pI have a Jtable with three column . The last columns contains checkboxes . I need to enfore single selection model on them . Although i know it can be done via adding a table change listener and enforcing its value to false everytime there is a change in table . But isnt there any other way of doing so . Likewise i mean a renderer to enforce Single selection of checkbox on that column or something similar to it. An example would be great help.p
Negative 173 pI have a window with a background image and I want to create a panel like in .NET with a white border and a semitransparent background emRGBA255, 255, 255, 124em, so the image in the background could be also visible. Should I use emSTATICem control or a child window for that I know that in order to set the emRGBAem color of a window I have to use codeSetLayeredWindowAttributescode, but I dont know if that would work with emSTATICem control. p  pWhat type of control is used normally for this and what strongWINAPIstrong functions could I use to set the border thickness and color Thanksp  pstrongSOME CODEstrong  p  precode Create the static control inside the WMCREATE of the parent window hPanel  CreateWindowEx     WSEXTRANSPARENT,      LSTATIC,      L,      WSCHILD  WSVISIBLE  SSWHITEFRAME,      10, 90,      200, 120,      hWnd,      HMENUIDCPANEL,      hInstance,      NULL   Trying to set the alpha level SetWindowLonghPanel , GWLEXSTYLE,      GetWindowLonghPanel , GWLEXSTYLE  WSEXLAYERED SetLayeredWindowAttributeshPanel , 0, 255  70  100, LWAALPHA   Changing the background color of the STATIC in WMCTLCOLORSTATIC case WMCTLCOLORSTATIC     hStatic  HDCwParam     switch GetDlgCtrlIDHWNDlParam          case IDCPANEL             SetTextColorhStatic, RGB255, 255, 255             SetBkColorhStatic, RGB26, 127, 231         break         default             SetTextColorhStatic, RGB255, 255, 255                 SetBkMode hStatic, TRANSPARENT          return LRESULTGetStockObjectNULLBRUSH     break codepre  pSo, the only thing I get with this code is a transparent bordered control.

Negative 173 pI am developing a series of event classes. These classes contain information acquired from a system. They are from different natures and may contain different messages, for example one possible event will contain a huge list of number, while another will carry query info in form of strings. I would like to create a builder function that creates the event of the correct type and returns to the user.p  pHere is a demonstration of how it will look likep  pmain.cppp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  include A.h include dA.h  using namespace std  int main      cout ltlt Hello world ltlt endl     A a  build5     return 0  codepre  pEvent.hp  precodeifndef AHINCLUDED define AHINCLUDED  include ltiostreamgt  class A  public     friend A buildint x protected     Aint x private  endif  AHINCLUDED codepre  pevent.cppp  precodeinclude A.h  AAint x               stdcout ltlt An         stdcout ltlt x ltlt stdendl        A buildint x      ifx  5         return dAx     return makex  codepre  pSpecial event.hp  precodeifndef DAHINCLUDED define DAHINCLUDED  include ltiostreamgt  include A.h  class dA  public A  public protected     dAint x   endif  DAHINCLUDED codepre  pspecial event.cppp  precodeinclude dA.h  dAdAint x  Ax      stdcout ltlt dAn  codepre  pAs you can see, all the constructors are protected, the intent is to hide the construction from the user  she should not create events from nothing, only the system can  and to guarantee that build function will return the correct type of event.p  pWhen compiling, I getp  precodeerror build was not declared in this scope warning unused variable a [Wunusedvariable] codepre  pIf I put every thing in the same file, I can compile, however, I end up with a huge file difficult to manage. Note that the above code is just an example, the real class I will use are huge, putting all in the same file, both declaration and implementation, everything becomes a mess.p

So something like thisp  precodeconvert string to NSData     NSData docData  [namenick dataUsingEncodingNSUTF8StringEncoding] NSData to NSArray     NSArray arrayJson  [NSArray arrayWithObjects[NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithDatadocData optionskNilOptions errornil],nil] codepre  pI am then creating an HTTP PUT request using a hrefhttpsgithub.comAFNetworkingAFNetworking relnofollowAFNetworkinga which is rad btw  p  pThe problem is that this creates a json string which looks likep  precode[namenick] codepre  pThis is valid JSON but Couch complains with 400 Bad JSON. Removing the [ ]s fixes the problem. Im sure these brackets are the result of converting NSData to NSArray but Im not sure how else to accomplish this using NSJSONSerialization. Can anyone help p  pThanksp  pstrongEditstrongp  pFor clarity sake let me explain the problem I was having further. I am creating a document using the CouchDB HTTP API using a PUT HTTP request. The document could be hand coded JSON and that is why I have this parsing challenge. Couch expects a single document to create. Therefore it expects a single JSON object. NOT an array of them. That seems to be why [keyvalue] returns a 400 HTTP response from Couch. Even if the array contains a single object. Seems a bit picky that the API wouldnt just infer correctly based on the array length.. but I guess you could argue either way. See the selected answer below. This is what I was looking for. Thanks to all those who responded   p

Negative 173 pI am using maven for building google appengine application. After the devserver starts when the application accessed by the client on the first request the application us redeployed and ServletListener is reexecuted. In this process the servlet context is lost. I am using servlet context to store the list of clients connected. Now because the app was redeployed automatically ans servlet context is cleared I loose the information that the 1st client was connected. The servlet context does store all subsequent clients connected until the dev server is stopped. p  pThe reason looks like some class file is change, which should not once the devserver is running.p  blockquote   pJun 25, 2013 63131 AM com.google.appengine.tools.development.JettyContainerService2 filesChanged   [INFO] INFO A file has changed, reloading the web application.p blockquote  pFollowing is the complete log p  precode[INFO]  [INFO]  mavenwarplugin2.1.1war defaultwar  NoteWebApp  [INFO] Packaging webapp [INFO] Assembling webapp [NoteWebApp] in [UserssaghoshdevNoteWebApptargetNoteWebApp] [INFO] Processing war project [INFO] Copying webapp resources [UserssaghoshdevNoteWebAppsrcmainwebapp] [INFO] Webapp assembled in [140 msecs] [INFO] Building war UserssaghoshdevNoteWebApptargetNoteWebApp.war [INFO] WEBINFweb.xml already added, skipping [INFO]  [INFO] ltltlt appenginemavenplugin1.8.1devserver defaultcli  NoteWebApp ltltlt [INFO]  [INFO]  appenginemavenplugin1.8.1devserver defaultcli  NoteWebApp  [INFO]  [INFO] Google App Engine Java SDK  Running Development Server [INFO]  [INFO] Retrieving Google App Engine Java SDK from Maven [INFO] Running SystemLibraryJavaJavaVirtualMachines1.6.0.jdkContentsHomebinjava XstartOnFirstThread javaagentUserssaghosh.m2repositorycomgoogleappengineappenginejavasdk1.8.1appenginejavasdkappenginejavasdk1.8.1libagentappengineagent.jar XbootclasspathpUserssaghosh.m2repositorycomgoogleappengineappenginejavasdk1.8.1appenginejavasdkappenginejavasdk1.8.1liboverrideappenginedevjdkoverrides.jar Dappengine.fullscan.seconds5 classpath Userssaghosh.m2repositorycomgoogleappengineappenginejavasdk1.8.1appenginejavasdkappenginejavasdk1.8.1libappenginetoolsapi.jar com.google.appengine.tools.development.DevAppServerMain allowremoteshutdown UserssaghoshdevNoteWebApptargetNoteWebApp [INFO] 20130625 120116.813 java[15483407] [Java CocoaComponent compatibility mode] Enabled [INFO] 20130625 120116.814 java[15483407] [Java CocoaComponent compatibility mode] Setting timeout for SWT to 0.100000 [INFO] Jun 25, 2013 120118 PM com.google.apphosting.utils.config.AppEngineWebXmlReader readAppEngineWebXml [INFO] INFO Successfully processed UserssaghoshdevNoteWebApptargetNoteWebAppWEBINFappengineweb.xml [INFO] 20130625 120118.717INFOLogging to STDERR via org.mortbay.log.StdErrLog [INFO] Jun 25, 2013 120118 PM com.google.apphosting.utils.config.AbstractConfigXmlReader readConfigXml [INFO] INFO Successfully processed UserssaghoshdevNoteWebApptargetNoteWebAppWEBINFweb.xml [INFO] 20130625 120118.978INFOjetty6.1.x [INFO]  Scan complete  [INFO] 20130625 120121.081INFOStarted SelectChannelConnector127.0.0.18080 [INFO] Jun 25, 2013 63121 AM com.google.appengine.tools.development.JettyContainerService startHotDeployScanner [INFO] INFO Full scan of the web app in place every 5s.

Negative 173 pI have a image encoded in base 64 that I generate with a javascript, and I want to save it to my server via an jquery ajax get.  I searched for several solutions to do this but none seem to work..  I tried Curl, fileputcontents and some variations of them in the PHP side. But as theyre not working Im thinking that the jquery may be aborting it before it gets to the PHP. This because in chromes network timline that request gets a failed status after 710 seconds.  I did a little research and found out that I can only send 2048 characters by url.p  pSo any ideas of what can I do I could generate the image on the server and that would save me a TON of trouble, but my project manager says that he wants all the processing done via clientside so we save resources. Any ideas will ve more than appreciated.p

Negative 173 pI am exploring using boostasio along with C11 features. In particular, I am focusing on an example called asynctcpechoserver.cpp, located here code is also shown at the end of my questionp  pa hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1540dochtmlboostasioexamplecpp11echoasynctcpechoserver.cpphttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1540dochtmlboostasioexamplecpp11echoasynctcpechoserver.cppap  pMy question involves the codetcpsocketcode member codesocketcode of the codeservercode class. In the codedoacceptcode method of the codeservercode class, codesocketcode is passed to codeasyncacceptcode. According to the asio documentation, codeasyncacceptcode requires, as its first parameter, the codesocketcode to accept the connection into. So far, so good.p  pThe next parameter, the callback for the asynchronous accept operation, is a lambda function. The body of the lambda constructs a new codesessioncode object, whose constructor also needs the same codesocketcode. Interestingly, codesocketcode objects cannot be copied so in the example, the codesocketcode object, which is a member of the codeservercode object, is passed using codestdmovecode.p  pI understand that the one and only codesocketcode object which is a permanent member of the codeservercode object is moved into the codesessioncode object. Fine  codesocketcode object is not copied, but moved  everybodys happy.p  pBut what happens on the next call to codeasyncacceptcode Is the same codesocketcode member of codeservercode, that was previously moved, passed in again When we move a member, what is left behind Is there a magical fountain of unlimited codesocketcode objectsp  pOr is something really lessthanobvious happening here When the codesocketcode is moved into the codesessioncode, is the contents of the left behindmoved from object codesocketcode member of codeservercode emswappedem with the contents of the new codesessioncode objects own notyetconstructed codesocketcode member Am I even making sensep  h1Summaryh1  pCode is below. Program flow is fairly simple. codemaincode constructs a single codeservercode object. The codeservercode makes repeated calls to codeasyncacceptcode. Each codeasyncacceptcode callback creates a new codesessioncode object, each constructed with a fresh codesocketcode. Where do all the fresh codesocketcode objects come from, if they are simply repeatedly moved from the same codesocketcode member in the single codeservercodep  precodeinclude ltcstdlibgt include ltiostreamgt include ltmemorygt include ltutilitygt include ltboostasio.hppgt  using boostasioiptcp  class session  public stdenablesharedfromthisltsessiongt  public     session tcpsocket socket       socket stdmove socket             void start          doread       private     void doread          auto self sharedfromthis          socket.asyncreadsome             boostasiobuffer data, maxlength ,             [this, self] boostsystemerrorcode ec, stdsizet length                               if ec                       dowrite length                                                   void dowrite stdsizet length           auto self sharedfromthis          boostasioasyncwrite             socket,             boostasiobuffer data, length ,             [this, self] boostsystemerrorcode ec, stdsizet length                               if ec                       doread                                                  tcpsocket socket     enum  maxlength  1024      char data[maxlength]    class server  public     server boostasioioserviceamp ioservice, short port       acceptor ioservice, tcpendpoint tcpv4, port       , socket ioservice               doaccept       private     void doaccept          acceptor.asyncaccept             socket,             [this] boostsystemerrorcode ec                              if ec                      stdmakesharedltsessiongt stdmove socket  gtstart   is this a swap of socket                                  doaccept                                 tcpacceptor acceptor     tcpsocket socket    int main int argc, char argv[]       try          if argc  2               stdcerr ltlt Usage asynctcpechoserver ltportgtn             return 1                   boostasioioservice ioservice          server s ioservice, stdatoi argv[1]            ioservice.run       catch stdexceptionamp e           stdcerr ltlt Exception  ltlt e.what ltlt n           return 0   codepre

Negative 173 pI am trying to build a web application to replace the functionality of an older desktop economics program. That program is essentially a calculation engine built on top of a Microsoft access database. The inputs and results are all stored on a series of tables. To offer compatibility to the legacy users, I want to have the ability for users to connect to their older, local access databases and upload them into the web app.p  pThe approach I was contemplating was to have a page that allowed the user to select the database they wanted from their local machine and then have the schema and the data for each table sent to the web application. I dont really want to upload the whole file  I just want to extract the relevant data.p  pI have done some research and I have looked into the HTML File API.

Negative 173 pIm having my first attempt at DDD and Im running into a problem with aggregate design.p  pMy application contains 3 Entities Graph, Node, Link.  Each of these entities has a name property which can be modified by the user which I believe makes name unsuitable as an Entity id.  A Graph contains a collection of Nodes and a Node has a collection of outgoing Links for the purpose of this problem it is safe to ignore incoming links.  Each Node can only be associated with one Graph at a time but can be moved between Graphs and similarly, each Link can only be associated with one Node at any given time but can be moved. p  pThe invariants I am attempting to enforce is that all Entity names are unique within their parent collection.  With the architecture described above, the invariant is on the actual collections, so I decided that the collection owners Graph and Node should both be Aggregate Roots.  p  pThe problem I have is how do I now enforce the name invariant on Node  On Link it is easy since it is hidden away inside the Node AR and as such Node can confirm that all Link renamesmoves do not break this invariant.  But as far as I can see, there is nothing to prevent a direct rename of Node which could break the invariant.  Eventual consistency is not an acceptable option here, this must be a true system invariant.p  pThe approach I am considering is to have Node.Rename actually enforce the invariant, but my concern is that this involves looking inside its parent Graph to check if the rename is valid.  This doesnt feel right  it feels like the Graph should be the one to enforce this namespacing constraint and that Node should know nothing about it at all.p  pI hope this makes sense, and I look forward to hearing peoples thoughts.p  pEdit  The Domain Model presented above is a simplified subset of the entire Domain.  Too complex for all entities to be held within a single AR.......p

For this, we use the conventional waybr Controller  Service  DAOp  pIn Spring we need to demarcate a Transaction, therefore we put Transaction annotation on all DAO methods.

Negative 173 pSo Im making a online chat program.p  pTechnologies AJAXmethodology PHP C ASP.net JQuery HTML5 MYSQL IISp  pIssue Longp  pIve implemented group chat which works fine up to now. My issue is with multichat. Mind you I now realize i should have done the entire thing in PHP, but only knew ASP.net and C when i started and will end up using PHP only, as a last resort. Anyway, when a multichat window is made, it injects the premade code via jquery into a div, stores it in sessionStorage for when the page refreshes, it loads the code from sessionstorage, and all IDs are incremented by one, for each user to have a max of 6 windows open at any given time. Now im trying to get specific querys for each specific users request like SELECT  WHERE user1  privateChatID  1 AND user2 privateChatID  1 not the actual query, just pseudo code, but since im using AJAX to get the query, I cant really manipulate the php file since its loaded because the main file is a .aspx page. Now for group chat Im using an update panel which works fine, but i cant dynamically make a draggable chat window, inside the update panel, because Id have to use an  runatserver  attribute, and if i run that in the prescripted jquery and wanted to increment the ID like so IDName  i , visual studioiis gives an error, hence the reason im trying to use Ajax. So all the problems Ive worked out so far, once i get a working version Ill probably rethink the whole structure all together. My only issue nowp  pIssue short Would it be easier since i cant manupulate functions or variables in the php file, to just select everything from the  DB message table and sort everything client side or would that not be optimal OR is there a way to alter querys externally for a php file that is loaded by jqueryp

Negative 173 pI have some custom UIControl whose state goes from normal to pressed to selected. By the logic of the application, when the user lifts their finger, the control should be selected, and some view should be loaded. The view is rather large, containing lots of data and complex views. So the result is that when the user lifts their finger, the display freezes for roughly 100400 milleseconds, then displays what the user expected. The long delay before seeing the control in the selected state feels like an error. In order to fix it I did the followingp  precodeIBActiondidTapControlUIControlsender     sender.selected  YES     double delayInSeconds  0.05     dispatchtimet popTime  dispatchtimeDISPATCHTIMENOW, int64tdelayInSeconds  NSECPERSEC     dispatchafterpopTime, dispatchgetmainqueue, void         perform some long running task       codepre  pHowever, that 0.05 is just a guess, and I may be unnecessarily delaying the views appearance by 0.05. What I really want to happen is for the view to finish refreshing with the button in a selected state, THEN immediately perform the longer running task. Is there a better way to time this action Should I be using dispatchafter for thisp

Negative 173 pIm trying to use Scala tuples in a Java collection library that requires its elements to be codeComparablecode.

Negative 173 pUsing WPF my team is attempting to seperate the design and the code using the MVVM design patterns. To accomplish this, we are slowly moving away from the UserControl approach as this has a high ammount of coupling between design and code. We have been investigating using Control Templates, Styles and DataTemplates, in combination with a ViewModel class. We have gotten a large amount of this working to date.p  pThe issues we are having are in relation to communicationsnotifications between View and ViewModel. At present, we have solved the View  Viewmodel communication issues using ICommand. i.e. We create a button and bind its Command parameter to the name of a RelayCommand defined in the ViewModel. By doing so, a button click or other Command event raised from the View calls a function defined in the ViewModel. This works.p  pWhere were having our main issue is in getting the notification to run the other way around i.e. a change in data in the ViewModel needs to trigger an update in the View. We were doing this using NotifyPropertyChanged and DataTriggers, however this does not satisfy our needs. What we need is to be able to raise an event of some kind in the Viewmodel and have the View subscribe to said event. We have been searching for an answer to this and have found out about both RoutedEvents and AttachedBehaviors. RoutedEvents seemed like a winner of a solution, however from our research RoutedEvents cant be registered onto a ViewModel that doesnt extend from UIElement, and we are particularly trying to keep our code separated from the design.p  pUltimately what were trying to do is set up a ViewModel where a parameter can be set or a function can be called that will raise an event or behavior on the View, and subsequently run an animation. We did have this working with DataTriggers, however we are attempting to seperate our Animations out into the ControlTemplate and this raises issues as the DataTemplate that contains the DataTriggers has no access to the Storyboards defined in the ControlTemplate.p  pCan someone please point us in the right direction Specifically the raising of an event in a ViewModel that does not require extending UIElement and subscribing to this event in the View and activating a Storyboard.p  pThanksp

Negative 173 pIm trying to gather memory information that used by AppDomain by using .Net Hosting API.

I added counter that just counts cbSize parameter, and display it after Runtime stops.p  pBut the problem is that that count is different.

Negative 173 pI know for a Java Program to run on another Computer it needs JREJava Runtime Environment. But for a J2EE application SerlvetJSP or Struts2 framework application or Hibernate framework application or any Framework application of Java what are need to Run it Successfully on another computer where it is not developed.... I know JRE is required for both type of Application. and JDK is for developing an application.p  pI also know that for Mobile application to run on device it needs an Emulator that supports the particular OS Android, iOS, etc. Just like an Standalone Java Application.p  pBut for running J2EE application is there any other requirements than JREp  pFor Example I have made a site called SocialMash.com I want to have a working prototype to deliver to user User meaning like we all use Stackoverflow and other sites. What will I require to configure the site.p  pI know I will require a server like TomcatJBOSSGlassFish but that all will be on my side server side development side but Do the Users to use the site will require anything among JDK, JRE, Server, or anything to use SocialMash.com or just URL will be enough p

Normally this showhide operation works very quickly but if I attempt to do so in the same call chain as my long running function, the browser does not get chance to reflow and show the loading div before it is locked up by the long running function.p  pI have triedp  p1  just showing the div then calling the functionp  precodeloadingDiv.show longRunningFunction codepre  p2  showing the div then calling the long running function inside a setTimeout to be executed after the current function has finishedp  precodeloadingDiv.show setTimeoutfunctionlongRunningFunction, 0 codepre  p3  same as 2 but with a longer timeoutp  precodeloadingDiv.show setTimeoutfunctionlongRunningFunction, 100 codepre  pWith an even longer timeout say, 5000 milliseconds I am able to get the loading screen to show and my long running function to execute properly  but obviously this adds to the execution time and I guess wont be crossbrowser compatible it just so happens that the browser I am using happens to do a repaint in those XXXX milliseconds  another browser may notp  pIve also tried a mish mash of tricks Ive seen on SO and elsewhere to do with changing the codeoffsetLeftcode  codeoffsetTopcode on divs on the page, changing codeself.statuscode, but everything I do seems to have the same effect lock up the browser for a few seconds, with the old content on the page, then show the loading div once the long running function has finished.p  pI know what Im doing is wrong but it is what I want to do for the moment  ultimately I willbr 1 Break this code down into smaller chunksbr 2 Potentially move it into a Web Workerbr 3 Speed it up so that it does not take so long and doesnt lock up the browserp  pBut emfor nowem can anyone suggest an easy way of forcing that loading div to be shown to the user before my long running operation runsp

Ive dug through the Composer documentation and cant seem to find a proper guide  if one can even exist  for this case. At this point, Im wondering if its going to be different for every web host.p

Negative 173 pIts not any of the possible duplicates present on stackoverflow. Here is the problem statement. Ive two application running on two different subdomains.p  pstronga hrefhttpabc.myclient.net1234MyApplicationSite relnofollowhttpabc.myclient.net1234MyApplicationSiteastrong This is a Sharepoint site which is the hosting environment. My user control is deployed on this environment on the master page. The user control has a div element with an iframe. The src of iframe is set to the ASP.Net Web application of different subdomain discussed later. Im using jqueryUI library to open up the div containing iFrame as a dialog popup. Lets call this sharepoint site as codeconsumercode henceforth.p  pstronga hrefhttpxyz.pqr.myclient.net8080MyAppMyPage.aspx relnofollowhttpxyz.pqr.myclient.net8080MyAppMyPage.aspxastrong This is an ASP.Net Web Application on .Net platform 3.5. It serves as content inside iframe explained earlier. Lets call this codeprovidercode henceforth. It contains an accordion control from jQueryUI. On click of accordion head codeactivatecode event is fired normally and I execute a javascript function to resize parent iFrame. On same domain I achieved this by calling codewindow.parentcode DOM elements and then resized iFrame height from this web application. But I get codePermission deniedcode error now when consumer and provider resides on two different subdomains. I understand that this is due to the codeSame Origin Policycode.p  pTo fix this I just wanted to transfer the height value of web application to the host Sharepoint page. An event from from web application is fired  codeaccordionactivatecode which I need to listen on the Sharepoint page javascript using codewindow.addEventListenercode or codewindow.attachEventcode whichever is applicable. Since, Iframe is part of Sharepoint page and we have the new height value, so we can resize it after listening to the event raised from content window.

Because I want to show the username instead of the user ID I made a custom template functionp  precodefunction getUserNamepmcreator     var user       var data       dsuserList.fetchfunction         var data  this.data         forvar i  0, length  data.length i lt length i             ifdata[i].uID  pmcreator                 console.logdata[i].uLastname                 user  data[i].uLastname                                return user  codepre  pBut its not working as it should, the cells stay empty. I got no errors but I see that the remote request to fetch the usernames is not completed before the grid is filled out. I thought the custom function of fetch is waiting for the results to return but it dont seems so.p  pAny Idea I find thousends of examples but all with static local data. I need one with both remote, the grid conent and the template data.p

Negative 173 pWe just got some Samsung Galaxy S4 running 4.3 at work and we are using a Mobile Management system that Disables the Camera for security reasons. I have created a FlashLight App That works fine on my HTC one and Nexus 10 that I would like to use, but I get an error.  p  pThe funny thing is, if I use the built in Assistive light widget from Samsung, it works fine. So even with the Camera disabled, the LED still works, so its possible, I just dont know how.  I know what some of you might say, why not just use the widget... I just dont like that bulky widget and would like to have my own app.p  pHere are my Permissions in the Manifestp  precodeltusesfeature androidnameandroid.hardware.camera androidrequiredfalsegt ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.CAMERA gt ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.FLASHLIGHTgt ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.VIBRATEgt ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.WAKELOCK gt codepre  pAnd here is my MainActivity.javap  precodepackage com.company.flashlight  import java.io.IOException  import android.app.Activity import android.content.Context import android.content.Intent import android.content.pm.PackageManager import android.graphics.Color import android.hardware.Camera import android.hardware.Camera.Parameters import android.media.MediaPlayer import android.media.MediaPlayer.OnCompletionListener import android.os.Build import android.os.Bundle import android.os.PowerManager import android.os.Vibrator import android.util.Log import android.view.Gravity import android.view.Menu import android.view.MenuItem import android.view.SurfaceHolder import android.view.SurfaceHolder.Callback import android.view.SurfaceView import android.view.View import android.widget.ImageButton import android.widget.TextView import android.widget.Toast  public class MainActivity extends Activity implements Callback       public static Camera camera     private boolean isFlashOn     private boolean hasFlash     private SurfaceView sView      private SurfaceHolder sHolder     private PowerManager.WakeLock wl     Parameters params     MediaPlayer mp     ImageButton btnSwitch       Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.activitymain          PowerManager pm  PowerManager getSystemServiceContext.POWERSERVICE         wl  pm.newWakeLockPowerManager.FULLWAKELOCK, DoNjfdhotDimScreen           flash switch button         btnSwitch  ImageButton findViewByIdR.id.btnSwitch         sView  SurfaceView findViewByIdR.id.PREVIEW          sHolder  sView.getHolder                First check if device is supporting flashlight or not         hasFlash  getApplicationContext.getPackageManager.hasSystemFeaturePackageManager.FEATURECAMERAFLASH          if hasFlash               device doesnt have or support a LED flash             Toast toast  Toast.makeTextthis, R.string.noflashmessage, Toast.LENGTHLONG             toast.setGravityGravity.CENTER, 0, 0             toast.show              Show message and sho2w a white screen              TextView txtBkupLightTextViewfindViewByIdR.id.tvBkupLightSrc             txtBkupLight.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE             txtBkupLight.setHeight1920             txtBkupLight.setBackgroundColorColor.WHITE           else            get the camera         getCamera           displaying power button image         togglePowerButtonImage           Switch button click event to toggle flash onoff         btnSwitch.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener               Override             public void onClickView v                  if isFlashOn                       turn off flash                     turnOffFlash                  else                       turn on flash                     turnOnFlash                                                                  Get the camera     private void getCamera          if camera  null              try                  sHolder.addCallbackthis                 ifBuild.VERSION.SDKINT lt Build.VERSIONCODES.HONEYCOMB                     sHolder.setTypeSurfaceHolder.SURFACETYPEPUSHBUFFERS                 params.setFocusModeCamera.Parameters.FOCUSMODEINFINITY                 camera  Camera.open                 try                      camera.setPreviewDisplaysHolder                  catch IOException e                      e.printStackTrace                                  params  camera.getParameters              catch RuntimeException e                  String err  e.getMessagenullCamera failede.getMessage                 Log.eCamera Error.

Negative 173 pMultiple finegrained invocations of Entity Beans add the overhead of network calls, even multiple transaction. In other words, the risk is to have a solution that has a high network overhead, high coupling, poor reusability and maintainability. We use session facade to encapsulate businesstier components and expose a coarsegrained service to remote clients. br We use Data Transfer Object reduce the number of calls, and that means that you need to transfer more data with each call.

Negative 173 pThis is a continuation of a question asked two years ago in this thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8762345vb6equivalentofstringisnulloremptyVB6 equivalent of string.IsNullOrEmptya I think.

What I currently have is a line of code underneath my TextBox2Change code reading TextBox2  Form1.TextBox1.Textp  pThis ALMOST does what I want it to do. The only problem is that it is requiring me to input any character in to the TextBox2 when Form2 pops up before it displays.p  pIm trying to get that problem solved and then Im eventually going to try to get it to chop off part of the file name until just the project file name displays.......but thats a whole different game Ill be playing.

Negative 173 pIm fairly new to both PHP and Ajax, so this might seem trivial, although I couldnt seem to find a clear answer to this.p  pIm sending a query to a process.php using ajax, and then display the result on the page. What Ive got works fine and everythings okp  precode.ajax    type POST,    url process.php,    data  data1 yada, data2 yadayada,    beforeSend functionhtml        somediv.htmlltpgtloadingltpgt    ,    success functionhtml       somediv.htmlhtml      codepre  pNow, this works because Im basically echoing the result of the query at the end of process.php, which then gets displayed in somediv. The thing is, Id also like to retrieve some of the data that was processed in the PHP to use it in my JS. However, I dont want to echo this data at the end of the PHP, as I dont want to display it in somediv.p  pIn other words, say my process.php looks like thisp  precodevar1  hello world var2  Its sunny outside var3  [key1gtone, key2gttwo, key3gtthree]  result  var1 . var3[key2] echo result codepre  pThe result gets displayed in somediv, thats fine. But what if Id like to make a wonderful alert in JS with the content of the var3[key3] without displaying it in somedivp  pShould I make another query to do so which seems inconvenient and inefficient, or is there a way to pass data from process.php to the JS without echoing itp  pThanksp
Negative 173 pWe are using a page with layers of Javascript tabs. We are trying to disable access to some of the tabs based on user permissions.p  pFor example, here is a tab examplep  precodeltdiv classexecutives tab productA productB productC runatserver idexecutivesTopgt     ltdiv classtabLeftgt         ltdiv classtabMaingt             Executives         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pThe tabLeft and tabMain are just for the CSS layout of the tabs and do not interfere with anything. The executivesTop div is where all of the action takes place. We use a separate .js file that assigns the event handlers to the various tabs.p  pWhen the page loads, I want to disable all mouseenter, mouseleave, mouseover, and click events on all tabs. I first did this with the following lines in window.loadp  precodethis line disables the event handlers from the tabs .tab.unbindmouseover mouseenter mouseleave click this line changes the basic css to appear disabled .tab.csscolor, grey codepre  pWe have a serverside script that determines the current users permissions and sends those to a field that jQuery can read. jQuery then looks at those permissions and enables tabs accordingly.p  precodeSubscriptionsInput is a hidden label that has a list of user permissions in the form of productA,productB,productC if SubscriptionsInput.toLowerCase.indexOfproductA gt 0      .productA.bindmouseover mouseenter mouseleave click  codepre  pObviously this isnt going to work, as Im not reassigning the event handlers to the tabs. The various mouse events go through a class sheet, and the click events are in the aforementioned .js file. I dont know how to reassign these. I think my reasoning is sound, though, in disabling everything and then reenabling things as permissions dictate.p  pThe simple solution, as far as what Ive researched suggests, is to use the .on and .off functionality, which would be great if we were at jq1.9 or better, but were at jq1.4.2 still, which is frustrating. I cant use .bind.unbind unless there is a simple way to reattach the event handlers from the existing .js file.p  pI really just need to be able to disable and reenable mouse and click and cant use .on.off. Also, I need to be able to revert the css of the tabs back to the stylesheet definitions.p  pI hope Ive explained this clearly enough. Can anybody offer any suggestions or code tricks I could use to bring this functionality to lifep  pedit my initial build had all the tabs loading and the ABSENCE of a permission would disable relevant tabs, which would make the .unbind idea work well as permissions wouldnt be given or removed midsession so an unbind is fine, but some tabs are applicable to multiple permission levels. Id rather enable content as users have permissions rather than risk disabling something that should be accessible at a given permissions level.p

Negative 173 p[EDIT For now, Ive ended up handrolling my own solution with swing timers, which seems to be working OK for my needs. Im still concerned about performance and would be willing to junk my solution in favour of Trident if anyone can suggest a solution to the below. Looking around online, Im wondering whether Trident is still alive as a project NB I also tried TimingFramework but didnt see advantages compared to my own code.]p  pIm an old hand with backend Java programming but inexperienced with the GUI side, and completely new to the Trident library. Our requirement is to have a large number of labels that fade in and out independently, so Im keen to do this with a library rather than trying to handcode everything.p  pThe test code below reproduces the problem.

Initially there may be no textual content and my CSS styling is created to allow the text to wrap around the default image.p  pI am having a problem trying to position the image statically, still allowing the text to wrap around the image and also have the text to begin vertical positioning near the top of the cell.p  pI am basically using CSS for my image as suchp  precode.TextWrap      floatright     margin10px     height100px     width100px  codepre  pThen setting up my div elements for the image and text content like thisp  precodeltimg classTextWrap srcViewBag.Photo gt ltdiv idbio stylepositionrelativetop0pxgt      ltdiv stylecolorFFFFFFtextalignleftmarginleft15pxmarginright15pxgtModel.Bioltdivgt                      ltdivgt codepre  pThe problem can be seen here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net2mT4X relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net2mT4Xap  pIn the Full Text example, both the text and image are positioned relatively around the same distance from the top of the page which is ideally what Im trying to accomplish.p  pIn the Partial Text example, you can see that both the text and image are still positioned relatively together but because there is less textual content, both elements have dropped to the approximately the center of the cell.p  pI would like to control the positioning of the text and image so both are always a set distance from the top of the cell inclusive of the text wrapping regardless of the number of characters for the text input.p  pWhat I am looking for would be similar to a vertical alignment to the top but Table Cells seem to ignore that styling attribute.p  pI am somewhat proficient with CSS but in no way an expert and could use some guidance for this. p

Negative 173 pi want to access local mysql database  from SERVER using php.p  pMy client has an offline product database for a high street shop that they update fairly frequently for their own purposes. They are now creating an online store which they want to use product information from this database.p  pMigrating the database to a hosted server and abandoning the offline database is not an option due to their current legacy software set up.p  pSo my question is how can I get the information from their offline database to an online database Their local server is always connected to the internet so is it possible to create a script on the website that somehow grabs the data from their server and imports it into the online server If this ran every 24 hours it would be perfect. But is it even possible And if so how would I do itp  pThe only other option I can think of is to manually upload the database after every update, but this isnt really a viable idea.p

Negative 173 pIs there any harm or benefit for having instance methods call static methods to do their workp  pIf your confused by what I mean, take a look at the example code below.  StripFormatting is an instance method and static method.

If a developer decides not to create an instance of PhoneUtil they can call the static method except this method has a parameter for the PhoneNumber.p  precodepublic string StripFormatting          return PhoneUtil.StripFormattingthis.PhoneNumber   public static string StripFormattingstring psPhoneNumber          string tsPhoneNumber  psPhoneNumber         Regex toNotDigit  new RegexD         tsPhoneNumber  toNotDigit.ReplacetsPhoneNumber,          return tsPhoneNumber  codepre

If this generates an error, i.e. there is no sheet after the active sheet, then a new sheet needs to be added. I was hoping there was something as simple as If... Is Error Then ...., but there isnt. p  pI have tried multiple variations of On Error with no luck. Even in cases where there is another sheet after the active one, thus no error, it still creates a new sheet, but I just want it to select that sheet.

Negative 173 pSo far I have a site that is displays perfectly in google chrome however on other browsers such as IE, Firefox and Safari the site layout and images get really distorted. The sites original structure should go like this a colored section covering the entire screen with an svg image in the cneter, a white section covering the entire screen then repeated about 4 times. On internet explorer and firefox however, the image enlarges to take up the whole screen and the colored section starts to take up more than the entire sceen. On safari the layout display fine but my svg images displays in weird proportions that are either too stretched or too small. That may be confusing so Ive included a jfiddle and my code down below. I know Ive got a weird problem and I think most of it is due to how I set up ym svg but I cant find the solution.

Negative 173 pI have written an exception handler that is meant to log all uncaught exceptions  in the code before calling the normal python exception hooks. Python and iPython have slightly different ways of doing this.

Negative 173 pI am trying to track user events happening on my site. One way to do this is send an ajax request every time you see an event. But this will unnecessarily load the server. One way to mitigate this problem is to send request in bulk on unload eventright now i have set a threshold of 16 events. But the problem arises during unloadbeforeunload event. p  pThe following are the problems i am facingp  ul lipAJAX request does not work unless they are synchronous. But i need to use asynchronous as its counterpart could cause problems if the server response is slow. Most of the questions raised on this matter in Stackoverflow suggests you to use sync.

Negative 173 pIve recently embarked on learning Laravel.  In doing so Ive began completing tutorials from around the web, including from youtube.  In one such tutorial Ive been developing a very basic blog.  Ive hit something of an impasse when working with slugs.  For some reason, it just doesnt want to work for me  p  pWhen the following code is entered in my routes.php file, I have noticed that the braces  and  are automatically converted to URL encoding and the word slug is displayed.  Additionally, the  following the word posts is nowhere to be seen.

Negative 173 pConsider the example of the end of this question its a readytorun Python 3 programp  pAnyway, theres a problem with it. That is, if you press the context menu key and the escape key in rapid succession, eventually the keyboard will lock up. Mouse clicks will still work. The only solution seems to be to close the program and restart it.p  pThis may seem like a pretty rare bug, but you actually dont always have to press them so much to cause the bug. Sometimes, with as few as potentially one to three button presses, it locks up. How fast you open and close it seems to matter a great deal. If you take care to press one, wait a moment, and press the other, youll likely never encounter the bug.p  pThis still may seem like a pretty small problem, since people might not want to open and close it quickly, ever. However, this is just the barebones example that produces the problem. Its not my reason for wanting to fix it.p  pIn my actual program a text editor, you press the menu button for example thats not the only usecase, a dialog pops up, you type in something, and it outputs something special to the text editor. Its kind of like a really powerful Linux compose key. I dont want to get into it. Youll just have to trust me that its exceedingly useful for a variety of purposes.p  pAnyway, the problem is if people are typing in codes in quick succession, on rare occasions, the keyboard locks up, just as when you alternate pressing escape and the menu button in this example code below. The enddialog method is called when a successful code is entered. So, the code below is replicating the issue just without all the functionality.p  pSo, my question is, what is causing the bug Is something wrong with the code Is it just my system I have a suspicion that my video card driver might be the culprit, rather than my code, or Tkinter. So, if you try it for a good while, and still cant replicate the bug, please tell me.p  pAnyway, Im using Xubuntu 14.04, 32bit Python 3.4.0.p  precodefrom tkinter import   class Editor     def initself         self.ckdNone         self.tkTk         self.frameFrameself.tk         self.textTextself.frame         self.text.bindltMenugt, self.mydialog         self.text.pack         self.frame.pack         self.tk.attributeszoomed, True         self.text.focusset     def enddialogself, event         self.text.focusset         self.ckd.destroy         self.ckdNone         return break     def mydialogself, event         if self.ckdNone             self.ckdToplevelself.tk, height100, width200             self.ckd.bindltEscapegt, self.enddialog         else             If it is already there, bring it into focus.              self.ckd.lift             self.text.focusset         return break  eEditor e.tk.mainloop try     e.tk.destroy except     pass codepre

Negative 173 pWe need to implement an authenticationautorisation web service and I am not sure if we should use the Oauth protocol in our situration.p  pThe background of the story p  pWe have some J2EE web applications in a jboss server. Authentication and authorisation of the applications are implemented by JAAS and deployed in this jboss server.We want to add some new web applications that are implemented in other languages and deployed in other servers. To reuse the authenticationautorisation mechanism in the jboss server, we need to implement authenicationauthorisation web services for the new applications.p  pSo here comes some thoughtsp  pIs it necessary to adapt the OAuth protocol for the authenticationautorisation web service  p  pAs I know, OAuth2 is use to grant access to functionality, users data, etc.. without giving the password to the 3rd party app. This is not really our case as we actually own all the applications, although that the newly apps are not in the authentication server. p  pAnother choix is to implement the login webservice et then return the new apps a tickettoken to use later.p  pIn another way, with OAuth protocol, newly apps do not involve in users loginpasswords, which seems to be nice...p  pDo you have some ideas p

Negative 173 pI just upgraded to Xcode 6 and I am really confused as to how I can create a new class. I want to make a new UIViewController class and UTableViewController class but I dont know what to click on. The only one that seems to come out with both a .h and a .m is the category class however where did all the methods go In Xcode 5, you had viewDidLoaddidSelectRowAtIndexPath and all other such methods that usually just got loaded up when I made a new file. Has Apple decided to scratch that or I am missing something,p  pThanks for the helpp

Negative 173 pIm running PostgreSQL 9.3 and want to import some daily generated csv files into specific tables. I started playing with FDW Foreign Data Wrapper and pointed to a specific csv, where I can query and appendupsert to a table.  But I have two more needs   The file generation date and source branch is present in the filename, and only there.     I need to get this information and insert also in the table.   As expected, the files names are not fixed, so the FDW doesnt know where to get the information.p  pI thought about solving this using some unix tools although my Postgres runs on windows, basically for each file in a list from a previously created index, the script would rename the file and pass the branch and date as parameters to a psql.exe command line, where the import would be from a fixed name in FDW.p  pThis would work, but this script sound a bit like a hack and not a very elegant solution.  Does anyone has an better suggestionp  pThanksp

Negative 173 pSorry if I get terminology wrong  Ive only just started learning Python, and Im receiving instruction from friends instead of being on an actual course.p  pI want to search a list containing lots of arrays containing multiple elements, and find arrays with some elements matching, but some different.p  pIn less confusing terms e.g. I have a list of arrays that each contain 2 elements I think this is called a 2D array sop  precodelist  [[1, 2], [2, 2], [3, 5], [4, 1], [5, 2], ...] codepre  pIn my specific example, the first elements in each sub array just ascend linearly, but the second elements are almost random. I want to find or sort the arrays only by the second number. I could just remove the first number from each arrayp  precodelist  [2, 2, 5, 1, 2 ...] codepre  pAnd then use something like if list[x]  1 to find 1 etc.br side note Im not sure how to find ALL the values if one value is repeated  I cant remember quite what I wrote but it would only ever find the first instance where the value matched, so e.g. it would detect the first 2 but not the second or thirdp  pBut I want to keep the first values in each array. My friend told me that you could use a dictionary with values and keys, which would work for my example, but I want to know what the more general method would be.p  pSo in my example, I hoped that if I wrote thisp  precodeif list[[, x]]  [, 1] codepre  pThen it would find the array where the second value of the array was 1, i.e. [4, 1] in my example and not care about the first value. Obviously it didnt work because  isnt Python syntax as far as Im aware, but hopefully you can see what Im trying to dop  pSo for a more general case, if I had a list of 5 dimensional arrays and I wanted to find the second and fourth values of each array, I would writep  precodeif list[[, x, , y, ]]  [, a, , b, ] codepre  pAnd it would match any array where the value of the second element was a, and the value of the fourth was b. p  pe.g. [3, a, 4, b, 7], [20, a, 1, b, 9], [cat, a, dog, b, fish] etc. would all be possible results found by the command.p  pSo I want to know if theres any similar way to my method of using a question mark but that actually works to denote that an element in an array can have any value.p

Negative 173 pIn my Oracle Database Programming course, the first part of our final lab assessment requires that wep  ul liIdentify the Primary Key of the table as it is currently shownli liFind all functional dependencies of the table which we are given to work with.li liDraw the dependency diagram for the tablesli ul  pThe table is in 1NF to begin with.p  pFrom the research I have done, it seems like I need to essentially combine every possible FD, which would not only consume a very large amount of time, but seems bizarre considering he wants us to then map these relationships in the dependency diagram.  This would basically cause everything to link to everything  and this is why I believe I do not understand functional dependencies.p  pI understand that a functional dependency constitutes that in R, XY, where Y is not produced by anything other X, and should enable you to determine every other value in the table through this dependency.p  pI also understand that X and Y can consist of more than one attribute.  This is what I dont understand, because if I map my attributes into algebraic variables which seems to be the way to do it, I have the letters AJ the number of dependencies I would come up with seems astounding, and I dont want to waste time doing something the wrong way.p  pDoes this mean I need to provide all fully functional dependencies, partial dependencies, and transitive dependencies  Just the thought of this is overwhelming.p  pMy table consists of 10 columns in its current state of 1NF  thus, AJ would be my attribute identifiers in the process.  I have found that RAD constitutes a formidable Primary Key, but Im not sure if I need to derive the PK from laying out all of the FDs, or if I can choose a PK and find my FDs from this point.  If thats the case  do I still lay out every FD, given that my PK will really determine the mapping of the relationships within the modelp  pSorry for the wall of text, Im stressed, confused, and exhausted.

Negative 173 pI read about about strongPersistence Contextstrong but not able to get a clear picture about my doubts which are as follows.br  1. I have a DAO class which as a codePersistenceContextunitName private EntityManager entityManagercode and from my strongServicestrong method i am starting the transactionSpring Managed using codeTransactionalpropagation  Propagation.REQUIREDcode. I understand here is every time this Service method is called, a codeTransactioncode will start and when it reaches to DAO class it will use the same Transaction but for every codeEntityManagercode operation it look for Active PersistenceContext and create it as required. Is this approach correct and thread safebr So, if a new thread starts the same service method then a new Transaction and a persistence Context will be created and flushed away when the method endsbrbr 2. I have multiple WARS which need to interact with database so I am sharing the EntityManagerFactory using Spring Shared contexts. I am having all the codeHibernatecode related configurations at a common place and in every WAR i am specifying codelttxannotationdriven transactionmanagertransactionManager gtcode where codetransactionManagercode will be shared. Is it rightbrPlease clarify my doubts and your comments are valued. Thanks in advance.p
Negative 173 pIn Objective C, how do I avoid having all this extensive error handling in my methods Ive read that Apple suggest that NSError references should be used only when errors are expected, but this approach causes the code to be completely cluttered with error handling code. p  pa hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaConceptualExceptionsExceptions.html relnofollowApples guide to Exceptionsap  pThere is especially one sentence in this document that catches my eye p  blockquote   pa parsing library might use exceptions internally to indicate problems and enable a quick exit from a parsing state that could be deeply recursive however, you should take care to catch such exceptions at the top level of the library and translate them into an appropriate return code or statep blockquote  pThis is an incomplete and unoptimized snippet of code demonstrating what I mean.

Or have I misunderstood Apples guidelines p

Negative 173 pI have a requirement within my Angular app which uses the Angular UI Router, to go back from one screen URL to a previously visited screen URL. There are several screens URLs where its possible to visit the destination page. Its not quite as straight forward as a simple codehistory.backcode operation though because I have several interim states that can occur in any order and any number. To get around this I have implemented a wrapper around the Angular location service, like sop  precodefunction       use strict     angular         .modulemyApp         .factorylocn, [location, state,             function location, state                  var states  []                 return                      go function url                          location.pathurl                     ,                     pushandgo function state, params                          states.push name state.current.name, params state.params                          state.gostate, params                     ,                     push function url                          states.pushurl                     ,                     pop function                           var state  states.pop                         state.gostate.name, state.params                     ,                     search function searchDict                          location.searchsearchDict                                                   ]   codepre  pAs you can see, this stores the state in a javascript local variable of the codelocncode service. I can call codepushandgocode and that means when I subsequently call codepopcode I can return to the page I came from regardless of what page that was.p  pThis works OK, until the user refreshes the page when they are on the destination page.p  pThe states array is recreated loosing all previously pushed states.p  pIm struggling to come up with a nice solution to this other than using cookies or local storage yuck.p

Negative 173 pI have an app that uses a UITableView to layout a cardsstyle UI, where each cell is a card. That means that each card has a lot of subviews and a lot to draw to the screen.

The thing I cant get past is  the view needs to draw to the screen on the main thread. So Im kind of stuck as to what I could do to not make it lag.p

Negative 173 pLike many others, I have been struggling with PHPExcel memory usage when reading a file to convert it to MySQL. p  pOf course I have tried the usual things mentioned in various places and have been able to increase memory efficiency by at least 40. This includes using a custom chunked reader class, moving chunked reader instantiation outside of the read loop, etc. p  pI have 16G of RAM on my test server and allocated a 2G max memory usage in PHP. For files under 200K rows, PHPExcel will work slowly but surely. Once over a certain size the script fails simply outputting Killed to the shell. The logs showed that the kernel killed PHP because it had used too much memory. While watching CPU and memory usage using the top command I can see memory free and swap free plummet while memory used and swap used skyrocket. p  pAfter reading a LOT about PHPExcel and looking at some of the source files I have come to the conclusion that a lot of data is stored about each cell that is not needed when processing only text. Usingp  precodeobjReadergtsetReadDataOnlytrue codepre  phelps a bit, but doesnt really do that much... However, using a chunked reader and setting the chunk size to something small then using unset to clean up big variables should theoretically work. I know that PHPExcel must read the whole file each time, but it shouldnt be storing it in memory right p  pHere is the code I am currently usingp  precodeltphp  datedefaulttimezonesetAmericaNewYork settimelimit7200 inisetmemorylimit, 2048M  includeonceclassesPHPExcelPHPExcelIOFactory.php  inputFileName  PATHTOFILE.xlsx inputFileType  PHPExcelIOFactoryidentifyinputFileName worksheetName  Sheet1  class chunkReadFilter implements PHPExcelReaderIReadFilter      private startRow  0     private endRow  0      public function constructstartRow, chunkSize              thisgtstartRow  startRow         thisgtendRow  startRow  chunkSize           public function setRowsstartRow, chunkSize              thisgtstartRow  startRow         thisgtendRow    startRow  chunkSize           public function readCellcolumn, row, worksheetName                if row  1  row gt thisgtstartRow ampamp row lt thisgtendRow                      return true                  return false         objReader  PHPExcelIOFactorycreateReaderinputFileType objReadergtsetReadDataOnlytrue  chunkSize  1000  echo Got here 1n  chunkFilter  new chunkReadFilter2,chunkSize   for startRow  2 startRow lt 378767 startRow  chunkSize      chunkFiltergtsetRowsstartRow, chunkSize     objReadergtsetReadFilterchunkFilter     echo Got here 2n      objPHPExcel  objReadergtloadinputFileName     echo Got here 3n      sheet  objPHPExcelgtgetSheetByNameworksheetName     echo Got here 4n      highestRow  sheetgtgetHighestRow      highestColumn  sheetgtgetHighestColumn     echo Got here 5n      sheetData  sheetgtrangeToArrayA.startRow..highestColumn.highestRow, NULL, TRUE, FALSE     printrsheetData     echo nn   gt codepre  pWhich outputsp  precode[USERBOX Directory] php PhpExcelBigFileTest.php Got here 1 Got here 2 Killed codepre  pThis leads to the question Is PHPExcel trying to load the whole file into memory regardless of my filter If it is, why is PHP not stopping it at 2G memory usage, but allowing it to get so bad the kernel has to kill PHPp

Negative 173 pWhat would be the best way to do the following in Javascript  AngularJSp  pI have an input box and a soft numeric 10 key buttons.p  pInstead of having the user enter . on the keyboard or press the . on the soft pad, the input should assume a number 2 places or less is a decimalp  precodeUser Enters 1  0.01 2  0.12 3  1.23 .00  123.00 codepre  pIt needs to be able to handle mixing keyboard and soft key input. The user can press the . key on the physical numpad. The soft numpad only has 0 and .00, no . key.p  pThe backspace key would delete 1 digit from the right. 100.50 then clicking backspace should produce 10.50, not 100.5p  pThe advantage to the fixed decimal is not needing to enter a ., which would be far more common than entering whole numbers outside of the quick cash buttons I have on the right.p  pCurrency formatting the value in the inputbox is a requirement, but outside of the scope of this particular question. thinking of using ngcurrency or numbrojs since ngcurrency stores the model as a float.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzSu4h.png altenter image description herep  pIm currently working through the problemp  precode  function concatNumbernum            if vm.transaction.paymentAmount  undefined  vm.transaction.paymentAmount  0  vm.transaction.paymentAmount                        vm.transaction.paymentAmount  0.0  num             return           codepre

Negative 173 pWhat are the underlying differences between F tuples and structs. They can both hold multiple variables, but I just want to know when one is used over the other.p  pTo be more specific, I am trying to pass a bunch of parameters through a bunch of functions with a new variable being accumulated each time. For example, I start with param1 and pass it into func1 which returns param1,param2. This tuple or struct then gets passed to func2 which returns param1,param2,param3, and so on.p  pMy current thoughts are this with a tuple, I can always hold just the right amount of arguments, but I give up a uniform format for the data, and in the end, I would have to pack and repack a tuple of about 10 elements. With a struct, I have the advantage of uniformity of the parameters, but the problems is, I would have to null specify the parameters in the beginning.p

Negative 173 pI am trying to add AngularJS form validation to Symfony2. There are a ton of great tutorials to do this either using the backend generated form and making an API. None, however, even seem to touch form collections or dynamically adding forms using the dataprototype. Now I think I know why.p  pIm having great difficulty with the ngshow validation using the dynamic form type. The oddest thing is that the CSS classes work just fine, but I cant get for example ngshownewsale[newsale[phones][0][name]].valid to show up.p  pa hrefhttpplnkr.coedith1yYwYjUeKtd5wvTOSgvppreview relnofollowhttpplnkr.coedith1yYwYjUeKtd5wvTOSgvppreviewap  pHeres a Plunker of whats happening. Type just spaces for the first three inputs, the input will turn red and a little Oops message will display at the bottom. Then click the little    and another three sets of inputs will show up. Type spaces in each of those and the Oops message will not show up. ngshow seems to not be able to see the input, even though its a part of the same form with the exact same name as the input.p  pIm really new to AngularJS so it might be something stupid, or might be something AngularJS cant do, I dont know.p  pSo far Ive triedp  ul liChanging the append to a directive with a templateli liUse ngrepeat with subform ngformli liusing ngrepeat with hardcoded forms worked until i put the dynamic stuff in there, like the dataprototypeli ul  pThis works with just typical jQuery, i cant fathom why this is so difficult in AngularJS. Any help greatly appreciated, just getting to this point has taken two days. p  pHeres the raw code, but its easier to try it on Plunkerp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml langengt ltheadgt ltmeta

Negative 173 pstrongHello Everyonestrongp  pI am having a hardtime in correcting this error that I am facing while developing an android app. I tried to run in an emulator, but it crashes and gives the nullpointerexception error. Then, I made a new project and from scratch copied those files into a new project, and still the same error. Then, I made a part of the app into a new project, and still it gives the same error. The error is something to do with launching the activity the I am using. Below are the given necessary files, I hope someone can guide me to the right direction and tell what mistake am I doing. strongThanks alotstrongp  pstrongDISPLAYPOINTS.JAVAstrongp  precodepackage com.example.safedrive  import java.io.BufferedReader import java.io.InputStream import java.io.InputStreamReader import java.util.ArrayList  import org.apache.http.HttpEntity import org.apache.http.HttpResponse import org.apache.http.NameValuePair import org.apache.http.client.HttpClient import org.apache.http.client.entity.UrlEncodedFormEntity import org.apache.http.client.methods.HttpPost import org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultHttpClient import org.apache.http.message.BasicNameValuePair import org.json.JSONObject  import android.text.Html import android.app.Activity import android.os.AsyncTask import android.os.Bundle import android.util.Log import android.view.Menu import android.view.MenuItem import android.view.View import android.widget.Button import android.widget.TextView import android.widget.Toast  public class DisplayPoints extends Activity       String name  Ammaar     TextView displaypoints     Button btnstart  Button findViewByIdR.id.btnStart Start Button Variable     String displayPoints     InputStream isnull     String resultnull     String linenull     int points     int code      Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.displaypoints         TextView lblName  TextView findViewByIdR.id.lblName         displaypoints  TextView findViewByIdR.id.lblCurrPoints POINTS TO DISPLAY IN          lblName.setTextHtml.fromHtmlWelcome ltbgt  name   ltbgt          new Insert.execute          btnstart.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener               public void onClickView arg0                  MainScreen.IsStartedtrue                 SpeedPoints start  new SpeedPoints                 Intent i  new IntentgetApplicationContext, SpeedPoints.class                 startActivityi                 Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext, The app has started monitoring your drive...,                         Toast.LENGTHLONG.show                  start.startAnimation                                    class Insert extends AsyncTaskltString, Void, Stringgt               Do the longrunning work in here             protected String doInBackgroundString... args                  ArrayListltNameValuePairgt nameValuePairs  new ArrayListltNameValuePairgt1                 nameValuePairs.addnew BasicNameValuePairfname, name                  try                                  HttpClient httpclient  new DefaultHttpClient                 HttpPost httppost  new HttpPosthttpammar123.net84.netcapstonedisplayPoints.php                 httppost.setEntitynew UrlEncodedFormEntitynameValuePairs                 HttpResponse response  httpclient.executehttppost                  HttpEntity entity  response.getEntity                 is  entity.getContent                 Log.epass 1, connection success                                   catchException e                                      Log.eFail 1, e.toString                     Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext, Invalid IP Address,                     Toast.LENGTHLONG.show                                        try                                      BufferedReader reader  new BufferedReader                     new InputStreamReaderis,iso88591,8                     StringBuilder sb  new StringBuilder                     while line  reader.readLine  null                                              sb.appendline  n                                          is.close                     result  sb.toString                 Log.epass 2, connection success                                   catchException e                                      Log.eFail 2, e.toString                                    try                                  JSONObject jsondata  new JSONObjectresult                     codejsondata.getIntcode                     pointsjsondata.getIntpointss                     displayPoints  Integer.toStringpoints                          catchException e                                  Log.eFail 3, e.toString                           return displayPoints            End of doInBackground method              protected void onPostExecuteString displaypoints                   displaypoints.setTextdisplayPoints                 Toast.makeTextgetBaseContext, Points Retrieved,                         Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show          End of onPostExecute       Override     public boolean onCreateOptionsMenuMenu menu           Inflate the menu this adds items to the action bar if it is present.         getMenuInflater.inflateR.menu.displaypoints, menu         return true           Override     public boolean onOptionsItemSelectedMenuItem item           Handle action bar item clicks here.

Negative 173 pI have a C WPF application which does some data processing.. Since the application takes some time to do the processing, sometimes the window freezes. So I am basically trying to find a way so the user doesnt freak out.. I was thinking of producing a second window when the processing is going on with some stats while the main window stays either in background or hidden until the processing is completed whichever works better. Maybe that will prevent things from freezing up or atleast hide itp  pAt the moment, I tried creating a second window when the processing starts by using the following code... but I am not sure how I would edit the XAML for it. Im using VS 2013 and only see the XAML for my initial window. Any help will be appreciatedp  precode    Window win  new Window     win.Show     win.Activate codepre

Negative 173 pDisclaimer I never used Java before last month, and I had never heard of ANTLR or StringTemplate before then either. For my internship this summer I was given a project using tools that nobody else at the company has ever used. Everyone has faith in me that I will figure it out. Hence the huge gaps in my understanding. I love this project and Ive learned a ton, so dont take this as complaining. I just want to make it work.p  pRight now Im working on a pretty printer proof of concept for an old domainspecific language. My ANTLR grammar is producing nice parse trees, and Im able to output simple StringTemplate examples like the ones in the introduction.p  pSay I have an simple template in my code.stgcode filep  precodemoduletype, name, content  lttypegt MODULE ltnamegt ltcontentgt END MODULE. codepre  pIn Java Im able to use codeaddcode to set the values for each of the template argumentsp  precodeSTGroup g  new STGroupFileexample.stg ST st  g.getInstanceOfmodule st.addtype, MAIN st.addname, test st.addcontent, abc System.out.printlnst.render   prints MAIN MODULE test abc END MODULE. codepre  pHow do I get ANTLR and ST to read in a text file and produce prettyprinted outputp  precodeMAIN MODULE test abc END MODULE. codepre  pShould becomep  precodeMAIN MODULE test abc END MODULE. codepre  pFor example. Thats not how I plan to format all the output, dont worry. Itll pretty print much prettier than that.p  pIn a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma245291783788802this answera I learned that ANTLR 4 generates walkers automatically. strongAssuming my ANTLR grammar is correctwellwritten, how do I match up the ANTLR rulestokens to my template arguments to generate output from an input text filestrongp  pIf I missed it in the documentation somewhere let me know. There are much fewer examples of ANTLR 4 and ST 4 than the previous versions.p

Negative 173 pI am writing a program where I have to make my finch robot follow an object. I have written it so that the finch will begin by sensing objects around it once it has been tapped on the top. As soon as I tap the top and cover the sensors, a red light is supposed to turn on and it will follow the object in the direction of the covered sensor. While it is moving, it should be making a buzzing sound and have the light change from red to green. When I stop moving the object, the finch is supposed to turn its nose back to red and wait until it is either tapped twice to end the program or until the object is moved for it to continue following.

Negative 173 pMy mobile application works with the aid of a backend server that processes all of the logic for the users, allowing them to communicate and interact with each other. However sometimes when making updates or changes to an application the backend or format of data may be changed. Possibly because of a logical error bug or for security reasons. p  pCurrently Im trying to figure out the best way to handle this before release of my application to the apple and android store. Whenever an update occurs to the application that requires the server to respond differently, I need to make sure all devices are updated to the proper version, if not there will be errors and some functions of the application may not work or yield unwanted results.p  pOne way to battle this would be to program with the idea of reverse compatibility in mind at all times, however sometimes when doing large updates or even ravamps of systems this may not be possible, some information may not be used, or additional information may be requires. The format of information may change, etc, etc. p  pSo this brings me to forcing an update for applications. Requiring that the application be brought up to the current version at all times before it can be used.p  pIm currently using the IonicCordova platform for hybrid development and Im wondering the best approach to take for this. Should I store the application and client version on the server and just have it run a check every so often Is there a way to check the appleandroid store to see if there is an update available for the application and then download it p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 173 pcodempmeventcode is like codempmworkercode except that codempmeventcode manages all nonSSL KeepAlive connections with a separate, dedicated thread rather than having each thread manage each individual connection.  By giving and then keeping a dedicated thread for each KeepAlive connection, codempmworkercode leaves that thread and its resources bound to that connection regardless of whether or not a request is being processed. codempmeventcode on the other hand, can lower system resource use in high concurrency environments by allowing the thread and its resources to be recycled back to the system once requests are complete.p  pIt seems to me that in high concurrency, nonSSL environments where KeepAlive has long timeouts, codempmeventcode has the potential to make for a system that can handle a higher workload with equivalent resources than a system with the same resorces using codempmworkercode. strongemMore importantly, it seems to me that in terms of resource use and features, codempmeventcode is at least as good as codempmworkercode, if not better, in all circumstances.emstrongp  pDespite my understanding that codempmeventcode is always at least as good and possibly better, my favorite Linux distributions default to using codempmworkercode when installing Apache 2.4 from the repositories. This makes me wonder if my thinking is incomplete and if there is some technical reason I am missing to use codempmworkercode rather than codempmeventcode in Apache 2.4.p  pstrongMy question therefore is am I correct in saying codempmworkercode is at least as good as codempmeventcode, if not better, in all circumstances, and 2 if not, what technical benefits are there to using codempmworkercode in Apache 2.4strongp
