Positive 65279 pI have a recyclerview and it contains a cardview, I load imases and strings in it from my database on Parse.com p  pSo far I have like 7 items in my list and all is fine so far.p  pWhat I would like to know is what happens when I have like 1000 items in my recyclerview will it start to slow down the app Do I need to put my recyclerview inside of an AsyncTask to prevent thisp  pOr does Glide image Loader library solve this issuei assume it will only solve this issue if I only used images in my recycler view and I would have to put my strings that are being loaded inside the recyclerview in their own AsyncTaskp  pOr do I simply need to put the entire PasreQuery that I used to fetch all the data including images into an AsyncTaskp  pThis is very important as I I dont want a few years from now when the app is being used it hangs when 1000, 2000, 3000 etc items are now being placed in the recyclerview from my database.p

Positive 65279 pIve got a problem with updating ListView with AsyncTask. p  pI use ViewHolders to improve performance, but they are causing problems with AsyncTask. As official android website says passing viewholder to asynctask is not a bad idea a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingimprovinglayoutssmoothscrolling.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingimprovinglayoutssmoothscrolling.htmla but in this case, when AsyncTask lasts long enough it updates two items at once with the same value. p  pI have an impression, that certain viewholder is used again 45 items further, and when asynctask does not finish work before passing again the same viewholder bug happens. After a while this viewholder is updating again and have correct value, but its not satisfying me.p  pIs my way of thinking right How to prevent thisp

Positive 65279 pI have a nonactivity that check for internet access using async task. By the way, the code for internet access check works correctly in an activity. Now when I added the code to a nonactivity class, I want the response to be saved into a string and send to MainActivity using startActivityForResult. I added a Toast to check if the value is passing to the MainActivity, but Toast shows blank. So, either the response is not saving int the string or its not sending to MainActivity. Ive also posted the log cat as when I button click in MainActivity due to value being null, the app crashes. p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodeLogCat  0926 133126.872 EAndroidRuntime22041 FATAL EXCEPTION main 0926 133126.872 EAndroidRuntime22041 Process com.example.networkping, PID 22041 0926 133126.872 EAndroidRuntime22041 java.lang.NullPointerException 0926 133126.872 EAndroidRuntime22041 at com.example.networkping.MainActivity1.onClickMainActivity.java43 0926 133126.872 EAndroidRuntime22041 at android.view.View.performClickView.java4562 0926 133126.872 EAndroidRuntime22041 at android.view.ViewPerformClick.runView.java18918 0926 133126.872 EAndroidRuntime22041 at android.os.Handler.handleCallbackHandler.java808 0926 133126.872 EAndroidRuntime22041 at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessageHandler.java103 0926 133126.872 EAndroidRuntime22041 at android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java193 0926 133126.872 EAndroidRuntime22041 at android.app.ActivityThread.mainActivityThread.java5388 0926 133126.872 EAndroidRuntime22041 at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNativeNative Method 0926 133126.872 EAndroidRuntime22041 at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java515 0926 133126.872 EAndroidRuntime22041 at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.runZygoteInit.java839 0926 133126.872 EAndroidRuntime22041 at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.mainZygoteInit.java655 0926 133126.872 EAndroidRuntime22041 at dalvik.system.NativeStart.mainNative Methodcodepre pre classsnippetcodecss langcss prettyprintoverridecodeNonActivity AsyncTask class   public  class Internet extends AsyncTaskltVoid, Void, Booleangt        String sam    Context context    Activity activity        public InternetActivity ac          activity  ac                 public boolean isNetworkAvailable         ConnectivityManager connectivityManager  ConnectivityManager context.getSystemServiceContext.CONNECTIVITYSERVICE        NetworkInfo activeNetworkInfo  connectivityManager.getActiveNetworkInfo        return activeNetworkInfo  null ampamp activeNetworkInfo.isConnected                 Override       protected void onPostExecuteBoolean result         ifresult                   Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext, Success, Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show         sam1         Intent view  new Intentactivity, MainActivity.class         view.putExtrazipcode, sam.toString         activity.startActivityForResultview, 1                                                else                   Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext, Failure, Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show         sam0     Intent view  new Intentactivity, MainActivity.class     view.putExtrazipcode, sam.toString     activity.startActivityForResultview, 1                                               Override         protected Boolean doInBackgroundVoid... params               if isNetworkAvailable                    try                    HttpURLConnection urlc  HttpURLConnection new URL httpwww.google.com    .openConnection                       urlc.connect                       int resp  urlc.getResponseCode                        return resp  200                    catch IOException e                        Log.eLOGTAG, Error checking internet connection, e                   System.out.printlnError checking internet connectione                                     else                    Log.dLOGTAG, No network available                 System.out.printlnNo network available                                  return false                         codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeMainActivity  public class MainActivity extends Activity        Button check     String zipcode         Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState                super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.activitymain                  zipcode  getIntent.getExtras.getStringzipcode         Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext, zipcode, 3000.show          checkButtonfindViewByIdR.id.check check.setOnClickListenernew OnClickListener   Override public void onClickView v   TODO Autogenerated method stub new CheckInternetConnection.execute String zipcode  getIntent.getExtras.getStringzipcode ifzipcode.equals1  Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext, Success, Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show  else ifzipcode.equals0  Toast.makeTextgetApplicationContext, Failure, Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show                    oncreate           activitycodepre div div p

Positive 65279 pIm developing an app, that fill in a gridView with an image and text from JSON files, i take just 2 o 3 seconds to finish the AsyncTask that perform this. I wonder if there is a way to display a splash screen with some brand on it and at the same time launch de asynctask that search on the JSON files, so that when the asynctask is finished the splash screen goes away and i have my activity with the grid view with all the necesary elements on it Thanks p

Positive 65279 pIn my application I have a requirement to display Images that are stored in external storage directory. I populate list view with these images. But, if there are too many images say, 10, app runs out of memory. I now understand that I should implement an Async task to achieve this.Can some one help me how do I do this. Should I call the Async class in LisviewAdapter.java or Activity.java Any example would be greatly helpful.Thanks in advance.p

Positive 65279 pI am having navigation drawer in which there are 8 menus in the drawer and each menu is having fragment which is downloading different data so each fragment is having its own AsyncTask. Now the problem is when users selects another menu from navigation drawer while first one is fetching data and populating Adapters of first data, app gives unfortunately application stopped... I want to add one more point so that you will get this more clearly. That is when I am opening the app first fragment starts fetching data and populating Adapter. If I do exit from the app while download of data of first fragment app do crashes because data is being downloaded and trying to update fragment adapterof the data but the fragment has been detached. So basically I want to stop data download of the first fragment when user selects second one. p

Positive 65279 pstrongGoalstrong update a widget view after codeAsyncTaskcode completes.p  pstrongScenariostrong widget codeonReceivecode receives an intent from a user click.  This starts a networking operation in an codeAsyncTaskcode.  An codeinterfacecode has been passed to the codeAsyncTaskcode via constructor as described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma99637051744123herea.  In the codeinterfacecode method, Im trying to send a broadcast that will trigger the widgets codeonUpdatecode method but I dont believe that it is firing.  p  pstrongThoughtsstrong My best guess is that codeonReceivecode has returned, therefore the codeContextcode that I was trying to use to codesendBroadcastcode is no longer available.  I was thinking that I could codegetcode  the codeAsyncTaskcode but I dont want to trigger ANR if the operation takes too long.  If I codegettimeout, unitcode the codeAsyncTaskcode, Im afraid that I risk missing the end of the task and the view will not be updated.p  pWhats the best way to update the widget view upon completion of the taskp  pstrongSolutionstrong Turns out that I made a mistake crafting the codeIntentcode that I was broadcastingp

Positive 65279 pIn my main activity LocalFeed I have a listview that is connected to an AsyncTask which gets data from the database in Json format and then it sends it to the BaseAdapter. My problem is that strongnotifyDataSetChangedstrong does nothing for me upon further researching I got the logcat output from it included below, I have read a lot of posts on here like this one a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28761334androidnotifydatasetchangednotworkingAndroid notifyDataSetChanged not workinga and have implemented their ideas but nothing works. I get the data originally when I set the adapter but when I have new data coming in it stays the same unless I call setAdapter again which is bad practice.

Positive 65279 pI am having navigation drawer in which there are 8 menus in the drawer and each menu is having fragment which is downloading different data so each fragment is having its own codeAsyncTaskcode.

I want to add one more point so that you will get this more clearly, that is when I am opening the app first fragment starts fetching data and populating Adapter.

Positive 65279 pI have read that an AsyncTask keeps running even if the calling activity has stopped. Keeping this in mind, I am trying to understand the working of onTaskCompleted. onTaskCompleted is usually called from onPostExecute of the AsyncTask and if the calling activity still exists, everything is good. But what if the calling activity has stopped Will this result in a crash of the appp  pThis question came to me because I was thinking of updating some global variables or UI components in the calling activity on the result of the AsyncTask. Is this a good idea Wont this also result in a crashp  pThanks.p
Negative 65279 pIm developing a web service whose methods will be called from a dynamic banner that will show a sort of queue of messages read from a sql server table.p  pThe banner will have a heavy pressure in the home pages of high traffic sites every time the banner will be loaded, it will call my web service, in order to obtain the new queue of messages.p  pNow I dont want that all this traffic drives queries to the database every time the banner is loaded, so Im thinking to use the asp.net cache i.e. HttpRuntime.Cache[cacheKey] to limit database accesses I will try to have a cache refresh every minute or so.p  pObviously Ill try have the messages as little as possible, to limit traffic.p  pBut maybe there are other ways to deal with such a scenario for example I could write the last version of the queue on the file system, and have the web service access that file or something mixing the two approaches...p  pThe solution is c web service, asp.net 3.5, sql server 2000. p  pAny hint Other approaches p  pThanksp  pAndreap
Negative 65279 pWhere do I find a directory where a lot of APIs or Webservices are collected Id like to generate a Web Site getting its content from different services, but I assume that spidering together the content is not legal e.g. getting the latest financial data from finance.yahoo.com.p  pSo I would like to have a list of APIs and WebServices not only financially related where I can search for such services. It would also help to generate new ideas, while reading through the list  Im sure there are a lot of services I do not even think of.p

Negative 65279 h2Backgroundh2  pIm trying out Scons by setting up a basic C sample project that has two subprojects p  ul liPrj1 is an EXE that depends on Prj2li liPrj2 is a DLL that exports some functionsli ul  pThe problem Im running into is that the library builds its .obj, .pdb, .lib, .dll, etc. files in the same directory as its SConscript file while the EXE builds its files in the same directory as its SConscript. The application successfully builds both the Prj2 dependency and itself. However, you cannot run the resulting EXE because it cant find the library it needs because it is in the other directory.p  h2Questionh2  pHow can I get multiple projects that have dependences to output their binaries and debug information into a common directory so that they can be executed and debuggedp  h2Potential Solutionsh2  pThis is what I have thought of so farp  ul liI tried using VariantDir previously called BuildDir however this doesnt seem to work.

Does anyone know of an easy way to do thatp  pOne obvious solution would be to write or steal a regexp parser, but that seems really over my head.p  pI repeat, Im looking for an strongeasy and universalstrong way to do that.p  pstrongEditstrong Brute force approach is out of the question. Assuming the random strings would just be code[az09]10code and 1 million iterations per second, it would take a hrefhttpswww.google.comsearchq28345E10292810000002a602a602a242a36529ampqscrl165 yearsa to iterate trough the space of all 10char strings.p
Negative 65279 pI have the following code in Perlp  precodeif index retval, [2]  1      fs  split [2], [1] codepre  pcode[2]code is the delimiter variable and code[1]code is the string that the delimiter may exist in. code[0]code is used elsewhere You may have guessed that this code is in a subroutine by those variable names.p  pAnyway, onto my question, when my delimiter is something innocuous like codeacode or codecode the code works like it should. However, when it is something that would get parsed by Perl regex, like a codecode character, then it does not work like it is supposed to. This makes sense because in the split function Perl would see something likep  precodesplit , [1] codepre  pwhich makes no sense to it at all because it would want thisp  precodesplit , [1] codepre  pSo with all of that in mind my question, that I cannot answer, is this How do I make it so that any delimiter that I put into code[2]code, or all the ASCII characters, gets treated as the character it is supposed to be and not interpreted as something elsep  pThanks in advance,p  pRobertp

Negative 65279 pIm using NAnt 0.85 to build a legacy project. The script itself uses the strongcodecsccode taskstrong not the codemsbuildcode task and works fine.p  pThe project is on its way to migrating over .NET 3.5. We already use VS2008, and C 3.0, while still targeting .NET 2.0 framework runtime.p  pNow the problem occurs when we want to upgrade our NAnt scripts, to compile C3.0 code using csc task.p  pI managed to compile C3.0 code with NAnt, by modifying the nant.exe.config to add the net3.5 framework section, but still, I cant figure a way to ensure that resulting assemblies will execute on .NET 2.0 runtime.p  pstrongMore problematicstrong  if Im using LinqBridge to leverage Linq without System.Core and .NET 3.5 runtime, the csc task fails and gave me an error message indicating that all linqrelated calls are ambiguous. In fact, NAnt csc task seems to automatically reference codeSystem.Core.dllcode, which causes a conflict with the only reference I effectively added to the codeltreferencesgtcode section, under the csc task codeLinqBridge.dllcode.p  pDo you now how to solve thatp
Negative 65279 pIve read a lot of trivial MVC examples of calculators and thermometers but I cant seem to map the pattern to real world applications.p  pSuppose you have a more complicated scenario. Say you have a website shopping cart which requires users to login before adding to the cart. First, the user sees the product page productdetail and clicks on add an item cartadd207366. The user is not loggedin yet so they need to visit the login page userlogin and then, being smart about the flow, takes them to the shopping cart view cartlist. From there, they can link back to the original product detail page to continue shopping.p  pLets say we have 3 database tables users, usercart, and products. What isare the models in this situation Would this entire flow be encapsulated into the addProductToCartFlow function of the ShoppingCart model That would seem to be a bit messy, since it would need to access the users table for loginauthentication and access the products table for pulling the product detailsprice into the cart. p  pInstead, would you say the ShoppingCart model is SELFCONTAINED and only deals with adding items, removing items, etc. from the cart The logic of the user being loggedin would then be checked elsewhere perhaps in the controller itself This would make the controllers very BUSY with quite a bit of business logic such as checking if the user is loggedin, checking if the shopping cart is empty, etc. and the model just becomes a pretty name for the database table.p  pOr maybe, the very fact of being loggedin or loggedout is part of a UserAuthentication model that deals with such functions. Or maybe we need a UserPageState model to tell us whether the user should be on a login page, or a cart page, or a product detail page p  pWhat is the best MVC design for this situation in your opinionp

Negative 65279 pIs it possible to define an instance method in ruby from a string the method name and a block the methods contentsp  pI imagine this will need to use instanceeval, but I havent figured out how to mix the two data types yet. Both the string and the block are dynamically determined, so it would work to create the block with the def string at the beginning  I dont know how to do this.p  pMy use case is a class that represents a Bacula configuration file. The configuration file can have many different types of resources. Theyre all stored in a relatively complex data structure behind the scenes for other reasons, simplifying this structure will not accomplish what Im looking for. Id like the resources to be rapidly accessible via named methods.p  pFor example, A represents one config file, B represents another. A has resources Director, Client, Job and B has Messages and Director.p  pIn this case, A should have methods director, client, and job while B has messages and director. Each of these would return the relevant resource from the objects respective config file.p  pemI know there are easier ways of doing this like implementing a [] method, but at this point Im pursuing the harder solution for curiositys sake.emp

Negative 65279 pHey guys. Im creating a rails app and being one of the first times Ive used the MVC pattern, let alone rails, Im running into ambiguity and uncertainty. I already defined an codeapplication.html.erbcode which is working great, it has a codeyieldcode statement which renders the current actions view.p  pI want application.html.erb to contain some dynamic content though, for example in a sidebar. I am wondering where the code for this dynamic content should go. While experimenting, I created a controller called home and defined the logic there, though I dont think it should go there. Its just that I didnt create a model because I dont need any form of database for this, and most of the examples Ive seen use models specifically to interact with some form of persistent data. In the home controller I defined the index action, and when I go to mysite.comhome it shows the dynamic content I wanted to see, but in the content section of the layout where the yield statement is.p  pBasically I feel all tangled up now, and I am wondering how I would go about placing this dynamic content in the side bar of my application.html.erb layout so that it remains throughout my site, since my entire site uses this layout.

And I couldnt find any decent guide on it.p  pSo I am trying out Xcodes built in SCM tool. It is working better, but it doesnt see when some files in the project were modified. Ive got a folder called CODE CORE and it is placed in a directory that is one level up from my project directory. It has some code that I use among different applications. And when I change code within that folder, the edited file is not being marked with M symbolin the SCM column. So it is not being committed to the repository, however the file itself is a part of working copy.p  pWhat may be the problem and how I fix itp  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 65279 pIm in the midst of preparing some SCM guidelines for our Subversion users and came across a point of contention with the team. Is there ever a valid use case for someone to make consecutive commits with identical messagesp  pIf you take the approach that a commit message should describe the what and why of code changes its difficult to see a valid case for this. Looking at our history, the instances where this has happened appear to be more out of convenience than anything else and really dont tell the story of what the code is doing.p  pDoes anyone have any views on the legitimacy of this Would guidelines or even precommit hooks be overzealous or is it a reasonable expectationp  pstrongEditstrong lets work with the assumption that people are already leaving good commit messages. IMHO, a single word like updated or typo does not constitute a satisfactory commit message. I would expect to see something more like Updated colour of submit button to green or Fixed typo in instructional copy. Its very difficult just to browse a repository log and understand whats going on in a project without drilling into individual commits if the message is a word or two.p

Negative 65279 pI have a piece of C code that looks like thisp  precodeconst char foo[2]  bar codepre  pNow codebarcode is a function that returns a codeconst void code.

The real problem here is the code const void  code definition of codebarcode. The codeconstcode in the definition codeconst char  [2]code refers to the elements of the array, not the pointer to the array. This type definition is essentially an array, which when represented by a codevoidcode pointer is emnotem codeconstcode.

This object is then added to an array which is returned from this method.p  pWhen running instruments I am getting a leak for the dictionary objects contained in the arrayOfDictionaries array. The code within the code[self generateDictionaryOfPeople]code method is calling code[dictionaryObject release]code on each NSDictionary object as it is created and added to the array, which makes the retain count on the object 1 as adding the object to the array would make the retain count 2, but then my release message decrements it back to 1.p  pI assume this leak is because I am never releasing the arrayOfDictionaries array, and thus the NSDictionary objects within the array are never released. If I attempt to release the array at the end of the above segment of code I get a message sent to deallocated instance error. I understand why this is occurring, because I am assigning the aPerson object data within a dictionary item that I am subsequently releasing but I dont know where else I can release the arrayOfDictionaries array.

Negative 65279 pRight now we are dealing with a bit of a conundrum in my corporate environment where we are being blamed for a server crash, but Im not 100 sure we are the culprit. Heres the server environment We have a primary Coldfusion and its MSSQL database. We then also have a secondary database MySQL hosted on a different cloud which is used for miscellaneous tasks. The main reason the system is structured this way is because the primary server is operated by our Content Management System thus we are not allowed to modify it, add tables, or any operations like that, so we use the alternate database for that. By design there are no mission critical items on it, and pages are built in a way such that if the alternate DB returns no rows, the pages will continue to render properly.p  pBasically, I am being told that when the alternate MySQL server goes down, or stops accepting connections, that it is taking the entire primary cloud with it, including 5 other sites hosted on it. I do not have access to the primary Coldfusion or database logs, because the CMS provider will not give them to me. Thus I can only judge based on the validity of the explanation they are giving me.p  pThe explanation for this behavior coming from our CMS provider is that when Coldfusion queries a database it creates a thread, and that if the DB doesnt respond the threads continue to stack. Eventually the processor is capped, and the server goes down. Is that an accurate explanation of how Coldfusion operates If so, is there anyway to prevent it, possibly with shorter DB timeouts and the like Or is the entire explanation posed by our CMS a red herring and something else is really causing the crashes.p  pAny guidance would be greatly appreciated.p  pQuestion answered  Documents found a hrefhttpkb2.adobe.comcps180tn18061.html relnofollowhttpkb2.adobe.comcps180tn18061.htmla httpwww.adobe.comdevnetserverarchivearticlescftimeoutsandunresponsiverequests.htmlp  pSetting timeout requests globally does not timeout internal processes waiting on external resources cfquerycfhttp etc. The only way to time those out is by manually setting the timeout attribute. Not setting this could result in thread overload and a crashed server as was occurring with us. p

Negative 65279 pIve recently started a new job where Ive been thrown into a bug fixing role on an under development ASP.Net MVC application. Im a big fan of using an MVC approach for web apps and built some hefty production apps on a hrefhttpmavnet.sourceforge.net relnofollowMaverick.Neta starting back in 20042005 however this is my first time using the ASP.Net MVC framework for anything other than mucking around.p  pOne thing Im finding myself doing a lot with the bug fixing is chasing through chains of controllers following the html.renderaction calls. In the past when Ive written MVC apps a single controller would be responsible for producing the model in its entirety. If there were common sections or functions for each controller theyd be subclassed, moved into the data access layer. It seems to me that in this case, and I suspect others, that having html.renderaction is going to encourage some seriously spaghettified code and really defeats the purpose of having the distinct CMV stages since it now becomse CMVCMVCMV etc.p  pIs html.renderaction really the best way to encourage clean code, it seems a bit smelly to me p

Negative 65279 pI have been researching this one for awhile. I found several resources on the subject and they all tend to use the same approach  override Page.Render, use the HtmlTextWriter to convert the output into a string, and then use a series of compiled regular expressions to remove the extra whitespace. a hrefhttpwww.altafkhatri.comTechnicalRemoveUnnecessarySpaceAndLineBreakFromMVCHtmlRemoveLinebreakASPNETMVCRemoveLinebreakSpaces relnofollowHere is an examplea.p  pWell, I tried it and it works...but....p  pIn Safari 5.0, this seems to cause all sorts of performance issues with loading images and getting server too busy errors. IE 7, FireFox 3.6 and Google Chrome 6.0 seem to work okay, but I havent stress tested the server very much. Occasionally there seems to be lags in the time the page is generated, but once the html is sent to the browser, the page displays quickly.p  pAnyway, when you think about it, it seems rather silly to have .NET build up all of these tabs and line breaks only to strip them all out again using string parsing  the least efficient way to strip them out. It would make more sense to override the HtmlTextWriter and pass it into the tree on the main page request in order to avoid putting them into the output at all  logically there should be a performance gain instead of a hit in that case.p  pEven if I can only remove 50 of the whitespace using this method, it will still leave much less work for the regular expressions to do  meaning it should perform better than it does with regular expressions alone.p  pI tried using a Control Adapter and overriding several of the membersp  ol liDirecting all calls to WriteLine to the corresponding Write methodli liSetting the NewLine property to an empty stringli liOverriding the OutputTabs method and simply removing the codeli liOverriding the Indent property and returning 0li ol  pI also tried overriding RenderChildren, Render, BeginRender, and EndRender to pass in my custom HtmlTextWriter, but I cant seem to make even a simple label control remove the tabs before its  tag. I also dug through the framework using Reflector, but I simply cant figure out how these characters are being generated  I thought I was using a catch all approach, but apparently I am missing something.p  pAnyway, here is what I have come up with. This code is not functioning the way I would like it to. Of course, I have also tried overriding the various Render methods on the page directly and passing in an instance of my custom HtmlTextWriter, but that didnt work either.p  precodePublic Class PageCompressorControlAdapter     Inherits System.Web.UI.Adapters.ControlAdapter      Protected Overrides Sub RenderChildrenByVal writer As System.Web.UI.HtmlTextWriter         MyBase.RenderChildrenNew CompressedHtmlTextWriterwriter     End Sub      Protected Overrides Sub RenderByVal writer As System.Web.UI.HtmlTextWriter         MyBase.RenderNew CompressedHtmlTextWriterwriter     End Sub      Protected Overrides Sub BeginRenderByVal writer As System.Web.UI.HtmlTextWriter         MyBase.BeginRenderNew CompressedHtmlTextWriterwriter     End Sub      Protected Overrides Sub EndRenderByVal writer As System.Web.UI.HtmlTextWriter         MyBase.EndRenderNew CompressedHtmlTextWriterwriter     End Sub  End Class  Public Class CompressedHtmlTextWriter     Inherits HtmlTextWriter      Sub NewByVal writer As HtmlTextWriter         MyBase.Newwriter,          Me.InnerWriter  writer.InnerWriter          Me.NewLine       End Sub      Sub NewByVal writer As System.IO.TextWriter         MyBase.Newwriter,          MyBase.InnerWriter  writer          Me.NewLine       End Sub      Protected Overrides Sub OutputTabs         Skip over the tabs     End Sub      Public Overrides Property NewLine As String         Get             Return          End Get         SetByVal value As String             MyBase.NewLine  value         End Set     End Property       Public Overrides Sub WriteLine      End Sub      Public Overrides Sub WriteLineByVal value As Boolean         MyBase.Writevalue     End Sub      Public Overrides Sub WriteLineByVal value As Char         MyBase.Writevalue     End Sub      Public Overrides Sub WriteLineByVal buffer As Char         MyBase.Writebuffer     End Sub      Public Overrides Sub WriteLineByVal buffer As Char, ByVal index As Integer, ByVal count As Integer         MyBase.Writebuffer, index, count     End Sub      Public Overrides Sub WriteLineByVal value As Decimal         MyBase.Writevalue     End Sub      Public Overrides Sub WriteLineByVal value As Double         MyBase.Writevalue     End Sub      Public Overrides Sub WriteLineByVal value As Integer         MyBase.Writevalue     End Sub      Public Overrides Sub WriteLineByVal value As Long         MyBase.Writevalue     End Sub      Public Overrides Sub WriteLineByVal value As Object         MyBase.Writevalue     End Sub      Public Overrides Sub WriteLineByVal value As Single         MyBase.Writevalue     End Sub      Public Overrides Sub WriteLineByVal s As String         MyBase.Writes     End Sub      Public Overrides Sub WriteLineByVal format As String, ByVal arg0 As Object         MyBase.Writeformat, arg0     End Sub      Public Overrides Sub WriteLineByVal format As String, ByVal arg0 As Object, ByVal arg1 As Object         MyBase.Writeformat, arg0, arg1     End Sub      Public Overrides Sub WriteLineByVal format As String, ByVal arg0 As Object, ByVal arg1 As Object, ByVal arg2 As Object         MyBase.Writeformat, arg0, arg1, arg2     End Sub      Public Overrides Sub WriteLineByVal format As String, ByVal ParamArray arg As Object         MyBase.Writeformat, arg     End Sub      Public Overrides Sub WriteLineByVal value As UInteger         MyBase.Writevalue     End Sub      Public Overrides Sub WriteLineByVal value As ULong         MyBase.Writevalue     End Sub  End Class codepre  pIn case you are not familliar with control adapters, simply place the xml below in a .browser file in the ASP.NET AppBrowsers folder.

Negative 65279 pIm interested in using numpy to compute all of the minors of a given square matrix.  Is there a slick way of using array slicing to do this  Im imagining that one can rotate the columns, delete the last column, rotate the rows of the resulting matrix and delete the last row, but I havent found anything in the numpy documentation that indicates this is possible.p  pQ  Why do this  A I have a long sequence Mn of fairly large matrices, roughly 1,000,000 10,000 x 10,000 matrices, and I want to compute the determinant of each matrix.  Each matrix is obtained from its predecessor by changing just one coefficient.  Its going to be quite a lot faster to compute the determinant of the first matrix in the sequence, and then compute the difference detMn1  detMn, which is the product of the changed coefficient and its minor.p

Negative 65279 pi need to transfer a file of 8.3MB over TCP, when i use file pointers to read and write to files then i send about 8.6MB data and also receives 8.6 MB of data by calculating the output of send and recv calls although my file size is 8.3 MB, further the when i check the size of file separately by seeing its properties then it is around 35 MB varies on every transfer but when i use file descriptors in place of file pointers then i send and recv exactly 8.3 MB of data and file property size also shows 8.3 MB. So what is the problem in using file pointers and why is it removed in case of file descriptors.... but if i use file descriptors then i am not able to read the text file that i sent.

Negative 65279 pIf you are a ruby programmer then you might have come across the hash block memoization pattern. For a simple example I present you the memoized version of the Fibonacci sequencep  precodefibhash  Hash.new do h,i   h[i]  h[i1]  h[i2] end  establish the base cases fibhash[1]  1 fibhash[2]  1 codepre  pOf course this is not the only way to create a memoized version of the Fibonacci sequence. You could also do the followingp  precodecache   cache[1]  1 cache[2]  1 def memofibn   cache[n]  memofibn1  memofibn2 end codepre  pHopefully you see how the hash block memoization pattern maps to the second version which is much more common in many other languages. What I would like to know is if there is any difference between the two versions I cant shake the feeling that the hash block version is more efficient but I cant really justify why.p

Negative 65279 pI have a number of items in an array, each one associated to a certain weight. There is a business rule saying that no two adjacent items cannot have a total weight of more than a certain value, lets say 100 for simplicity.p  pFor example, the following is okp  precode[40,60,40,50] codepre  pBut not this one since 5060  110p  precode[50,60,40]  codepre  pI am trying to implement an algorithm that will rearrange the items if possible so that the business rule is fulfilled. For example, the second one could be rearranged to     [60,40,50] or [50,40,60]p  pThe algorithm should also try to minimize the number of moved items, i.e. the first solution above is most appropriate since the sub permutation [60,40] is maintained. p  pIm not looking for a complete answer or code examples, but would be happy if someone could point out some algorithms or categories of algorithms for this purpose. It would feel much better to rely on an existing and proved algorithm than some homemade stuff p  pNote In reality, the number of items is very large so testing all different permutations is NOT an option.p

Negative 65279 pI am using XCode 3.2.6 on an Intel Mac running OS X 10.6, to build a fairly simple app that needs to be able to run under OS 10.4 on a PPCbased Mac, in addition to modern Intelbased Macs.p  pUnder the project settings, I only see options for 32bit Intel, 64bit Intel, and Standard 3264 Intel.

Negative 65279 h2Problem Backgroundh2  pGenerating and accessing data of a fixed column layout is easy.  You can create local temp tables upfront, and populate them by calling stored procedures.p  pOn the other hand, if you want to generate data with a dynamic column layout, you must generally build an SQL statement dynamically and execute it with exec spexecutesql.  Since the data layout is unknown at runtime, you cannot create a temptable upfront, and once inside the exec spexecutesql statement, any temporary tables created there are bound to that scope and vanish when the call returns, so its much more difficult to access the data i.e. your options are more limited.p  h2My Specific Situationh2  pI have a query that needs to access data in a dynamically generated table.p  pThe table is generated by a stored procedure, which dynamically builds a query, stores it in a variable sql nvarcharmax, and runs it by calling  exec spexecutesql statement  sql.p  pThe sql statement was something like select  into temptable from..., but temptable was destroyed by the time exec spexecutesql returned.  A quick fix for this was to just use temptable instead i.e. a global temp table, because it survives when the stored procedure returns AND I can easily access it in the calling scope because it has a knownstatic name.p  pI dont like this solution because global temp tables arent threadsafe name collistionwise, and I dont want to have to mess with dynamicallygenerated unique names, because Ill just end up having to use more dynamic SQL to access them... which puts me right back at square one, leaving the data inaccessible outside the SP.p  pI dont think returning table variables through output parameters is an option new to SQL Server 2008 too, unless it can be done without having to define a static table type.  The tables my stored procedure generates are dynamic, and depend on the input parameters passed.p  pInline tablevalued functions are not an option, because Im running code loops to build the sql query and calling exec spexecutesql.p  pMultistatement tablevalued functions instead of the stored procedure, is also not an option, because such a function must have a welldefined table format, whereas Im running dyanmic SQL to return a table with a variable number of columns and column names depending on the input parameter values.p  pAll I really want to do is select the result set of the dynamic query into a new table, but Im finding it difficult, as none of the above works particularly irritating is how local temporary tables arent local to the session, but local to the stored procedure so that they vanish upon returning.  The only a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions653714howtoselectintotemptablefromstoredproceduresolutiona Ive seen insists that using OPENROWSET is the only way, but I dont want to mess with connection strings inside my stored procedure, for the same reason I dont want to include uniquenamemanagement code... its just way more complicated than it ought to be.p  pIn summary, I just want to execute dynamic SQL that generates a dataset of an unknown format, and be able to easily access it from the calling scope.p

Since these curly braces are inside a script tag, i would assume EE would count them as javascript and non EE tag related. How can i tell EE that these are not EE tags.

Negative 65279 pIm sure a similar question has been asked before, and Ive looked around for a while for an answer that I can apply to my particular situation, but havent had any luck. Basically, I have a web application that acts like a time management system for its users, allowing them to see, add, and modify time intervals which theyve applied to a bug or problem at work. For the time being, I have a simple select box  populated via an AJAX call to a servlet  that the user can select their name from. Once their name or any other, for that matter is selected, the page then makes another AJAX call to the servlet to load all of their bugs and information.p  pI have been asked to save the last user selected in this select box to be saved as a cookie so that each time the page is loaded, it will automatically load in the information and bugs of that previouslyselected user. Yes, I know this isnt quite as protected and streamlined as a fullfledged login authentication system, but its what Ive been asked to do for the time being. This is what Ive been trying thus farp  h2HTMLh2  precodeltDOCTYPE HTMLgt lthtmlgt     ltheadgt         lttitlegtLighthouselttitlegt         ltscript typetextjavascript srcscriptsjquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt         ltscript typetextjavascript srcscriptsjquery.cookie.min.jsgtltscriptgt         ltscript typetextjavascript srcscriptsindex.jsgtltscriptgt         ltscript typetextjavascriptgt             document.readyfunction                  Script                      ltscriptgt     ltheadgt     ltbodygt         ltpgt             ltlabel forusersgtSelect Your Nameampnbspltlabelgt             ltselect iduserSelect nameuser onChangejavascriptUpdategt                 ltoption value561gtJon Smithltoptiongt                 ltoption value482gtBill Murrayltoptiongt                 ltoption value711gtLuke Skywalkerltoptiongt                 ltoption value241gtHarry Potterltoptiongt             ltselectgt         ltpgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  h2JavaScripth2  precodefunction Script      InitializeUsers   function InitializeUsers      var userId  .cookiefogbugzId     ifuserId  null userSelect.valuserId.change   function Update      var userId  userSelect.val     .cookiefogbugzId, userId,  expires 365       .getservletcommandgetBugs,          id userId     , functiondata          LoadEverythingAboutThatUserdata       codepre  pNow, Im making use of the jQuery Cookie plugin in order to create and look for the cookie Im setting for the user. Now, I have it set up so that each time the page is loaded, the script first checks for the cookie to see if one is present. If so, it changes the selectboxs value to that of the user ID stored in the cookie. In theory, this is supposed to induce the codeonChangecode function of the select box, codeUpdatecode. It may be a bit redundant, but I then set the cookie again to the current ID selected by the box, just in case they chose a different name. So, each time the box changes, it saves the ID. Each time the page loads, it looks for an ID and loads the page with the information of that user.p  pUnfortunately, its not working properly. I check Chromes cookie list and find that the ID is clearly saved properly img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLdEAA.png altenter image description here However, when I refresh the page, the select box either remains at the starting option or doesnt even load the names into the select box all together. Can anyone either see a problem with what I have here or perhaps have a better recommendationp  pstrongEditstrong In addition to updating my code to match the answer I selected, it seemed as though I also needed to place the checking of the cookie and tiggering of the selectbox change within the code.completefunction code of the code.getcode call. Im not sure if this is right, but I think that since the AJAX request was not immediate, I was having issues with trying to select an option that had not been fully loaded into the selectbox. With this change, I ensure that all of the options are loaded in before I attempt to trigger a change to my desired option.p

Negative 65279 pWhat is the advantage of mocking the container services in Unit testing of EJB 3.1p  pThe probable answers I get when I think about it are,p  ol liIt improves the performance of the tests.li liIt does not abide by the rules of Unit testing as there is a lot of interactions with other APIs. emPlease provide your views on thisemli ol  pOther than these, do you think there are other advantages   p  pAs many of you may know, it is possible to test some of the services provided by the container, like persistence, transaction management eg. using Bitronix, messaging eg. using Apache ActiveMQ and inmemory JNDI out of the container in your own JVM.  Still there is an argument that it is integration testing and unit testing should not be done that way.p  pAccording to me, if you can have a good performance in your tests, it is fine to use these third party implementations for unit testing because you do not have to spend too much time in mocking and mocking is heavily subject to developer errors.  If a developer does not have a good understanding of mocking, he might end up mocking everything or in other words misusing mocking to turn the tests green.  Is this right  emPlease provide your views on thisemp  pAfter all, I never got any solid definition of unit testing .  It depends on the author.  Some define unit as the smallest unit that can be tested and some define Depending on the context, these could be the individual subprograms or a larger component made of tightly related units.p  pThanks.p

Negative 65279 pIm using JSF2.0 and am building up a wizard. I have encountered a problem with SelectBooleanCheckboxes. Here is the workflowp  ul liLoad page with checkboxes values are bound to a SortedMap in the backing bean. li liTick them, and click next. This increments a cursor, which the page uses to determine which PanelGroup the load.li liThe correct values are persisted to the bean. li liClick back cursor is decremented and page renders the editable checkboxes. The first checkbox is not ticked even though the bound variable holds a value of true for that box.li ul  pThis cursorbased approach which contains all of the wizard screens doesnt seem to work. However, if i slightly modify this so that the prevnext buttons bring up different xhtml pages, this issue disappears.p  pUnfortunately I cant do this.

Negative 65279 pI am working on creating an IronPython console similar to the IronPythonConsole project provided with the a hrefhttpsgithub.comIronLanguages relnofollowIronPython source codea. However, I want to make the codeConsoleHostcode more extensible than the sample provided, such that it could be extended to run an IronPython interpreter in XNA, or WPF etc. As such, I have created a class codeIronPythonConsoleHostcode that extends codeConsoleHostcode from codeMicrosoft.Scripting.Hosting.Shellcode, modelled on the a hrefhttpsgithub.comIronLanguagesmainblobmasterLanguagesIronPythonIronPythonConsoleConsole.cs relnofollowcodePythonConsoleHostcodea source.p  precodepublic class IronPythonConsoleHost  ConsoleHost      ...     public override IConsole CreateConsoleScriptEngine engine, CommandLine commandLine, ConsoleOptions options              return new IronPythonConsole          ...    run in a ConsoleApplication static void Mainstring[] args      new IronPythonConsoleHost.Runargs  codepre  pThis creates a situation where codeIronPythonConsoleHostcode can be extended in other applications. For instance, a console could be integrated into XNA as follows assuming appropriate supporting classesp  precodepublic class XnaConsoleHost  IronPythonConsoleHost      public override IConsole CreateConsoleScriptEngine engine, CommandLine commandLine, ConsoleOptions options              return new XnaConsole       codepre  pHowever, this creates a situation where I am inheriting codeIronPythonConsoleHostcode simply to override a single method  no other functionality of the class needs to be changed. Furthermore, codeXnaConsoleHostcode is not being used in any situation that expects an codeIronPythonConsoleHostcode or indeed a codeConsoleHostcode, and this would seem to go against the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiLiskovsubstitutionprinciple relnofollowLiskov substitution principlea, as there is no usage scenario where substitutability is required or appropriate.p  pIt seems it would be more appropriate to design codeIronPythonConsoleHostcode such that it can be provided with a means of selecting what codeIConsolecode to create i.e. using composition instead of inheritancep  precodepublic class IronPythonConsoleHost  ConsoleHost      public IronPythonConsoleHostFuncltScriptEngine, CommandLine, ConsoleOptions, IConsolegt consoleSelector              consoleSelector  consoleSelector          ...     public override IConsole CreateConsoleScriptEngine engine, CommandLine commandLine, ConsoleOptions options              return consoleSelectorengine, commandLine, options          ...  codepre  pThis would allow the XNA game to simply construct an codeIronPythonConsoleHostcode with the appropriate selector functionp  precodeconsole  new IronPythonConsoleHosteng, cl, co gt new XnaConsole codepre  pThis approach works, but passing codeFunccodes seems somewhat clunky. This definitely seems like a situation where inheritance is a much less robust solution, but I dont think composition via awkward codeFunccodes is necessarily better especially if selectors are required for other areas  as they probably will be.p  pstrongIs composition a good approach for this situation, and if so, are codeFunccodes appropriate Or is there a common design pattern that is used in similar situations that I am perhaps missingstrongp

Negative 65279 pIm working on a project that has a website asp.net c and android app java that share some common functionality.  Currently when they need to use the same business logic the android makes a call to the website and gets the results.  Weve had a request for the android to work offline, so it would need to perform that business logic without hitting the website.  Are there any ways to do thatp  pThe only thing weve thought of so far are using javascript, as a node.js server for asp.net to hit and rhinoscript to include in the java.

Negative 65279 pI have a large code base of quite old C code on an embedded system and unfortunately there are no automated test casessuites. This makes restructuring and refactoring code a dangerous task.p  pManually writing test cases is very time consuming, so I thought that it should be possible to automate at least some part of this process for instance by tracing all the function calls and recording of the input and output values. I could then use these values in the test cases this would not work for all but at least for some functions. It would probably also be possible to create mock functions based on the gathered data.p  pHaving such test cases would make refactoring a less dangerous activity.p  pAre there any solutions that already can do this What would be the easiest way to get this to work if I had to code it myselfp  pI thought about using codectagscode to find the function definitions, and wrapping them in a function that records the parameter values. Another possibility would probably be a gcc compiler plugin.p

I ended up going with the latter, but here are the two methodsp  pemstrongMethod 1 Shape Fragmentationemstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comy5kgn.png altAn example of Shape Fragmentationp  pBasically, the idea is to break up the overlapping area into discrete segments that can have their midpoint and area be easily computed, and then take the weighted average for the entire result. p  pThe example shown here had three subpieces A center rectangle taking up the bulk of the area, and two curved segments for the edges of the circle.p  pemstrongMethod 2 Line Interpolationemstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comASbJS.png altExample of Line Interpolationp  pFirst off, you need to calculate a point in the rectangle which will be the base location. This should be a point that is easy to calculate and is in the overlap. What I use for this point is the average of all edge intersections of the circle and the rectangle if no edge intersections exist, I default to the location of the circle as it means one shape is contained within the other.p  pCcalculate the line between the center of the circle and that point. Then, calculate the segment that lies within the overlapping area. The midpoint of the area is taken to be the midpoint of that line segment.p  pThis method is inaccurate, but always produces a point within both objects, and the resulting point is generally close to the middle so it looks good to the casual eye. Its also far simpler and faster, so I went with it.p

Negative 65279 pLet me introduce this question by an examplep  pWe have UserNotification class. It has the information about notification, possible user options.  p  precodepublic class UserNotification       Event fired on notification broadcast     public event EventHandlerltNotifyEventArgsgt Notification      public string Title  get set      public string Description  get set      public ListltNotificationResultsgt Options  get set       ...       This function is called to raise notification      public void Notify              if Notification  null Notificationnull, new NotifyEventArgs       codepre  pSo we have a bunch of notifications. Each time when some part of the program needs to raise a notification for the user it takes some notification object and calls Notify method. Then Notification event is fired and all listeners may process this notification display it somewhere in gui, show dialog box etc.p  pFinally there are the number of such notifications from different parts of the software and even plugins. And notification listeners, most probably, would love to listem them all. So the next thing that comes in mind is NotificationManager. It has collection of UserNotification and NotificationRaised event which is fired when any of registered notifications fires its Notification eventp  precodepublic class NotificationManager      public event EventHandler NotificationRaised      private ListltUserNotificationgt notifications      public void AddNotificationUserNotification notification              notifications.Addnotification         notification.Notification   gt                                            if NotificationRaised  null NotificationRaised,                           codepre  pAnd here comes the question. Look at strongNotificationRaised, someEventArgsstrong. At this point we need to pass pointer to the source notification so that listener could work with this particular notification. The NotificationManagers event handler has source field that looks exactly as what we need...

Negative 65279 pFirst question Ive asked on stack and Im pretty new to R, so please pardon any etiquette offenses. Im plotting 2 stacked area charts using ggplot2. The data is wait events from an Oracle database. Its a performance tuning chart. I have several questions.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGFVvx.png altenter image description herep  ol liThe two plots below do not lineup correctly, most likely due to the width of text in the legend. Is there an easy solution to thisli liThe two plots are really correlated, where the top plot shows wait classes like CPU and User IO and the bottom plot shows the details of the specific wait events in those classes. Id like the colors in the bottom to be based on the wait class, the same as the top, just different shades of that color for the specific events. Im also open to other options if you dont like the concept. Its a lot of information to convey. Ive limited the number of events to 12 to fit in the color scheme, but there are more if it can work.li liId like to either show more granular time ticks on the X, or perhaps even shade the offbusiness hours 6pm8am gray just to convey a better sense of time of day.li liAre there any color schemes with more than 12 colors people commonly use Looked through brewer and this is the max.

Negative 65279 pOk, I am creating an app that serves as a virtual catalog for certain items. The problem is that there are over 600 items that need to be cataloged, and thats is extremely time consuming because I have to first add these items to a table cell viewer, along with the image of the item, then also insert a picture and 3 items of text into a view controller. Is there any way I can create a single view or similar, and then when the user taps on the table cell thats connected to the single view, its connected to code that will insert those items into defined spaces in the single view controllerp  pThis app is using ARC and Storyboards. I am using Xcode 4.3.3 with iOS 5.p

Negative 65279 pIn my WinRT XAML App I have an EntranceThemeTransition on my Main.xaml page which does not play when you first load the application App.Xaml does a Frame Load of Main.xaml. However once the application is loaded and I navigate away from Main then back it does play. I have noticed this in other WinRT apps I have built.p  pIs it a known bug or a feature that allows for faster startups I have spent the time to make a nice intro transition and it is a shame that most users will not see it. Seems like the transition loads in the background while the application loads up and by the time the user lads on the page the transition is complete.p  pCurrently I am playing around with Thread.Wait and some other hacks  but they are not making this a Fast amp Fluid experience and make the transitions seem chunky when you navigate back to them from another page.

It only happens and only occasionally if I start the subprocess after some other things such as string manipulation, openingcommunicatingclosing a socket with an ObjectInputStreamObjectOutputStream, and reading from a small file.p  pBecause of the infrequency of the hanging, its hard to narrow it down exactly, but I can definitely reproduce it in about 10 minutes by running the program in a Bash whiletrue loop until it hangs.p  pAlso I restarted my machine yesterday, so it should be unrelated to the leapsecond bug.p  pstrongSymptomsstrongp  pWhen it hangs, the stack trace looks like thisp  precodeFull thread dump Java HotSpotTM 64Bit Server VM 23.1b03 mixed mode  process reaper daemon prio10 tid0x00007f42904dc000 nid0x14bf waiting on condition [0x00007f427aa2f000]    java.lang.Thread.State TIMEDWAITING parking     at sun.misc.Unsafe.parkNative Method      parking to wait for  lt0x00000007c229fbf0gt a java.util.concurrent.SynchronousQueueTransferStack     at java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport.parkNanosLockSupport.java226     at java.util.concurrent.SynchronousQueueTransferStack.awaitFulfillSynchronousQueue.java460     at java.util.concurrent.SynchronousQueueTransferStack.transferSynchronousQueue.java359     at java.util.concurrent.SynchronousQueue.pollSynchronousQueue.java942     at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.getTaskThreadPoolExecutor.java1043     at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorkerThreadPoolExecutor.java1103     at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutorWorker.runThreadPoolExecutor.java603     at java.lang.Thread.runThread.java722  Service Thread daemon prio10 tid0x00007f42900f1000 nid0x14bc runnable [0x0000000000000000]    java.lang.Thread.State RUNNABLE  C2 CompilerThread1 daemon prio10 tid0x00007f42900ee000 nid0x14bb waiting on condition [0x0000000000000000]    java.lang.Thread.State RUNNABLE  C2 CompilerThread0 daemon prio10 tid0x00007f42900eb000 nid0x14ba waiting on condition [0x0000000000000000]    java.lang.Thread.State RUNNABLE  Signal Dispatcher daemon prio10 tid0x00007f42900e8000 nid0x14b9 waiting on condition [0x0000000000000000]    java.lang.Thread.State RUNNABLE  Finalizer daemon prio10 tid0x00007f429009b800 nid0x14b8 in Object.wait [0x00007f427b8f6000]    java.lang.Thread.State WAITING on object monitor     at java.lang.Object.waitNative Method      waiting on lt0x00000007c00057f0gt a java.lang.ref.ReferenceQueueLock     at java.lang.ref.ReferenceQueue.removeReferenceQueue.java135      locked lt0x00000007c00057f0gt a java.lang.ref.ReferenceQueueLock     at java.lang.ref.ReferenceQueue.removeReferenceQueue.java151     at java.lang.ref.FinalizerFinalizerThread.runFinalizer.java177  Reference Handler daemon prio10 tid0x00007f4290099000 nid0x14b7 in Object.wait [0x00007f427b9f8000]    java.lang.Thread.State WAITING on object monitor     at java.lang.Object.waitNative Method      waiting on lt0x00000007c0005370gt a java.lang.ref.ReferenceLock     at java.lang.Object.waitObject.java503     at java.lang.ref.ReferenceReferenceHandler.runReference.java133      locked lt0x00000007c0005370gt a java.lang.ref.ReferenceLock  main prio10 tid0x00007f4290009000 nid0x14b1 runnable [0x00007f4299077000]    java.lang.Thread.State RUNNABLE     at java.lang.UNIXProcess.forkAndExecNative Method     at java.lang.UNIXProcess.ltinitgtUNIXProcess.java135     at java.lang.ProcessImpl.startProcessImpl.java130     at java.lang.ProcessBuilder.startProcessBuilder.java1021     at scala.sys.process.ProcessBuilderImplSimple.runProcessBuilderImpl.scala68     at scala.sys.process.ProcessBuilderImplAbstractBuilder.runProcessBuilderImpl.scala99     at scala.sys.process.ProcessBuilderImplAbstractBuilderanonfunrunBuffered1.applyProcessBuilderImpl.scala147     at scala.sys.process.ProcessBuilderImplAbstractBuilderanonfunrunBuffered1.applyProcessBuilderImpl.scala147     at scala.sys.process.ProcessLoggeranon1.bufferProcessLogger.scala64     at scala.sys.process.ProcessBuilderImplAbstractBuilder.runBufferedProcessBuilderImpl.scala147     at scala.sys.process.ProcessBuilderImplAbstractBuilder.bangProcessBuilderImpl.scala113     at mypackage.Main.mainMain.scala  VM Thread prio10 tid0x00007f4290091800 nid0x14b6 runnable   GC task thread0 ParallelGC prio10 tid0x00007f4290017000 nid0x14b2 runnable   GC task thread1 ParallelGC prio10 tid0x00007f4290018800 nid0x14b3 runnable   GC task thread2 ParallelGC prio10 tid0x00007f429001a800 nid0x14b4 runnable   GC task thread3 ParallelGC prio10 tid0x00007f429001c800 nid0x14b5 runnable   VM Periodic Task Thread prio10 tid0x00007f42900f5800 nid0x14bd waiting on condition  codepre  pIf I run codejstack mcode or codejstack Fcode on the pid after its hung, I get this same exact output with codemcode and codeFcodep  precode jstack m 3199 Attaching to process ID 3199, please wait...

If there is a race condition in my own code, it would hang somewhere else and if the subprocess itself is hung, my Java process would only be hung in codewaitForcode but not in codejava.lang.UNIXProcess.forkAndExeccode. It seems like a JVM bug to me, but Im just not sure how to pinpoint it to a reproducible test case. Any suggestions on what to do nextp  pstrongEditstrongp  pWhen the hang happens, I have two identical java processes show up in top. When I ctrlc it, the main one exits but the other one remains, and doesnt die until I kill 9.

Negative 65279 pWe are developing Restful things. We use Jersey on OSGI Adobes CRX, which packs Apache Felix.  The API Spec comes up with some thing dealing with conflicting restful  requests, something like if the client sends the header Accept applicationjson and the request url is httpememmyresource.xml, we have to send json back Jersey will send xml back.p  pAlso it seems the main person very high rank technical and knowledgeable  person said we shouldnt use the extension such as .xml or .json for a search nonresource, i.e., it is against the principle to do something like httpmyrestsearch.jsonqabc. Instead, we should do some thing like httpememsearchoutputjsonampqabc  Implementing such a spec just makes our lives hard since manipulating what a framework Jersey provides is not fun. p  pWhat is your opinionp

Negative 65279 pI have a panel with 3 inner panels that all use a codeTitledBordercode. The third inner panel has a number of custom textfields that are painted with codeGradientPaintcode. The textfields come from a custom class that extends codeJTextFieldcode and uses an overriden codepaintComponentcode method along with a codeMouseListenercode, so that when mouse enters on a textfield area the gradient color slightly changes and changes back again when mouse leaves the textfield.p  pThe problem is that the gradient color change does not perform very well when those textfields are inside a panel with a TitledBorder which by the way is a compound border. I mean that they do not respond fast enough, but they respond well when theyre not in such a panel Ive tested this.p  pI thought that the problem is the border itself, so I tried to override the codeTitledBordercodes codepaintBordercode method where I added a print statement whenever this method is called to draw the border... and it seems that every time the mouse enters a textfields area and the gradient color changes the codeTitledBordercode is painted again. If I quickly move the mouse pointer across all the textfields theyre just 4 of them then the textfields are painted again which is normal but the compound codeTitledBordercode is also painted every time and I guess that this causes the performance issue.p  pMy question is simple, is there any way that I can tell Java NOT to paint again the panels codeTitledBordercode every time that the mouse moves on the panels inner components p  pI understand that this may cause problems sometimes, for example if I had a small titledbordered panel with a combobox if I clicked on that combobox, the popup menu could hide part of the panels border provided that the combobox is close to the borders bottom side, so when the popup menu itself is hidden again the border should be painted again or else it would leave a blank area at the space where the popup menu and the border overlapped.p  pBut in the previous case where the panel has only textfields and there is no need that the border should be painted again when the mouse moves at the panels area, is it acceptable to prevent codepaintComponentcode to be called and if yes, how or should I try something completely different that I didnt think of  sorry Im not very experienced.p  pI can provide code of the gradient textfields codepaintComponentcode method and the change that occurs on codemouseEnteredcode but I thought that the problems cause is clear and my assumption of why it occurs is right correct me if Im wrong...p  pEDITp  pOk while going through my custom classes trying to make the sscce I discovered my very stupid mistake. Instead of the standard TitledBorder I was using a CustomTitledBorder class thatp  p1 eliminated the 2 extra pixels added at the right side of the titled border 2 used a compound border and different font palatino bold.p  pThe problem was that the palatino font was not stored in memory but was read from the disk emeveryem time the constructor of my custom class was called. So it was also called every time paintBorder was called. And so it was called every time the mouse moved over a textfield in the panel with the above border. This was very stupid, Im sorry about this and I was trying to figure out the performance problem for a day and more.p  pThis does not answer my question though on how to avoid paintBorder to be executed every time the mouse is over a textfield, but it is not needed anymore and Im not really sure if it is acceptable anyway.p

Negative 65279 pI have a GameScene with enemies and player sprites added at z0. I add a background layer to GameScene at z1 and this works fine for the main background. The only thing is that I would like to display some clouds and for this they should be at z1 respect to the player and enemies sprites. p  pMy approach is to add the clouds at z2 of the background layer, but this is not good enough because they still appear below the enemies and player sprites. p  pI would have thought that the z value 2 would have been added to the background layer z value 1 resulting in an absolute compared to the GameScene parent layer z value of z1, hence above the z0 of enemies and player sprites.p  pClearly I am wrong. p  pI then observed that when I add a sprite to a layer, the sprite that is added last will be shown on top of the previous sprites if in the same layer e.g. adding enemies after player sprites will show enemies on top of player sprite. I imagine this is a convention to avoid odd graphical effects overlay of two images mixing up colours. strongIs this correctstrongp  pNow, my only solution would be to have multiple background layers one for the clouds and one for the actual background terrain, and add them at different z levels of the GameScene. Would this be correct The downside of this is that I have to maintain to classes that are logically similar.p

It would also be considered a match if there were an extraneous point in emPem which did not fall into a rectangle.p  pNeither the formation, nor point inputs, have any particular origin, and the scale between the two are not required to be the same, e.g., the formation could describe an area of a kilometer, and the input points could describe an area of a centimeter.  And lastly, I need to know emwhichem point ended up in emwhichem node in the formation.p  pIm trying to develop a generalpurpose algorithm that satisfies all of these constraints.  It will be executed millions of times per second against a large database of location information, so Im trying to fail out as soon as I can.p  pIve considered taking the angles between all points in both inputs and comparing them, or calculating and comparing hulls, but every approach seems to fall apart with one of the constraints.p  pPoints in the formation could also easily be represented as circles with an x,y origin and tolerance radius, and that seems to simplify the approaches Ive tried so far.

Negative 65279 pI need to read a text value from other window and query that value to another application my question will be around the 1st taskso, Im spying other window some 3rd party application we use in connection with our product and waiting for accept button to be clicked to read a value from a text box. This other application, the dialog box, has multiple text boxes and command buttons. I made a mouse hook and Im activating it upon this application appearance. Im reading all mouse moves inside this window rectangle texts, captions, child windows IDs, rectangles, grab leftrightmiddlewheel clicks. I can grab the accept button click I CAN SEE the button caption and I can read that window, get the text and determine what button is clicked, etc. Now I can read ALL EDIT class values, get their window handles, rectangles, etc., BUT I CANNOT IDENTIFY THEM AS UNIQUE items within the class collection I need specifically read my desired text box value. Fortunately the text box Im interested in is ALWAYS COMES FIRST IN MY LOOP when Im reading texts from EDIT class loop. However I would like to be more specific making sure that Im reading the text box with the NAME. I know. During the development I could read that NAME and hard code it in the program. My a suspicion is that control name is not saved in the binary code. My understanding is that control ID, windows handle are created upon windows creation and have absolutely no reference to control name say txtOrderNumber. If for buttons I can be specific because of button captions so, I can determine what button is clicked Im locked with EDIT class items and thrown to lucky 1st guess when reading the value. My question is How I can get a control name from another window, for this task Im interested to know about EDIT class instance names.

This makes sense, because there is an attribute at the top of the controller definition that shouldve called this function already and it seems it does that just fine.

Negative 65279 pIm working on an equipment management system using a MS Access .mdb file for the front end, and SQL Server 2008 for the back end. If needed I can convert the front end to a MS Access 2010 file.p  pI created a calendar form, where the users can see what equipment is booked, signed out, or over due. It looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIOtqx.png altenter image description herep  pI made this using 42 subforms, which is unfortunately slow. With the data shown above, it only takes about 5 seconds to load, but as soon as I use real data, it starts to really bog down unacceptably. I tried to make this more efficient by keeping the source object of the subforms blank until they are shown, as well as not loading the recordsource until this time. This helped enough to make the example seen above run passably fast, but it still isnt enough for real data.p  pSo what I would like to do, is either find a way to make this efficient while still using subforms, find another control that works in place of subforms, or to switch the subforms out with listboxes, but somehow still be able to format the colours of the rows. I understand this is impossible with listboxes as is, but I am a programmer, and am willing to try subclassing listboxes to do this if it wont waste too much of my time. Unfortunately I have never done any vba subclassing, so I would need to be pointed to some good resources in order to do so.p  pThe code to set the recordsource of each day subform is as followsp  precodefsub amp X amp Y.Form.RecordSource  SELECT   amp                                       FROM QRYCalendar  amp                                       WHERE CDateStartDate lt  amp curDate amp   amp                                       AND EndDate IS NULL OR CDateEndDate gt  amp curDate amp  amp                                       IIfCDatecurDate lt Date,  OR DateIn IS NULL OR CDateDateIn gt  amp curDate amp  AND DateOut IS NOT NULL,  amp   amp                                       ORDER BY IIFDateOut Is Not Null And DateIn Is Null Or CDate2DateIngt amp curDate amp  And CDate2EndDatelt amp curDate amp ,0,iifCDate2DateOutlt amp curDate amp  And DateIn Is Null Or CDate2DateIngt amp curDate amp ,1,2, ID codepre  pQRYCalendar looks like thisp  precodeSELECT B.ID, Person, Initials, ProjectNum amp  amp ProjectYear amp  amp FormatTaskNum,000 AS Project, SignOutCode, Value AS Type, StartDate, EndDate, DateOut, DateIn FROM TBLBooking AS B INNER JOIN TBLPerson AS P ON B.PersonID  P.ID INNER JOIN LKUPList AS T ON B.EquipTypeID  T.ID LEFT JOIN TBLUsage AS U ON B.ID  U.BookingID LEFT JOIN TBLEquipment AS E ON U.EquipmentID  E.ID codepre  pStartDate and EndDate in the table TBLBooking are the beginning and end of a booking, and DateOut and DateIn in the table TBLUsage are the beginning and end of a sign out. Each sign out is linked to a booking through the foreign key BookingID. If DateIn is NULL, that means that the equipment is currently signed out.p  pLKUPList is a poorly named table from before I started working on this years ago that I never bothered to change. It contains a list among other things of equipment types. Bookings are for equipment types and not specific items, and when a user signs out their equipment, a record in TBLUsage is created which is linked to a specific piece of equipment.p  pIf anyone has ideas on which direction I should take with this and where I can look for guidance it would be much appreciated.p

Negative 65279 pI have been dealing with PHP since 2000, but not very actively, and my knowledge of PHP5 is quite horrible. Recently I got my interest for webdevelopment back after a 5 year long break, and I started working on a project. I wrote a class for that project that became fairly large, but so far without any specific error handling.p  pThe purpose of the class is to parse HTML files with a specific layout and handle its data, and it was more or less a training exercise for me to get back into the game. I started to rewrite the class now, and I decided it was time to be a little more professional about error handling than simply using die, which I have been using a lot so far. I think we can all agree that is a terrible direction to take. I want the class to be quite project independent, so that I can distribute it to whoever wants to use it.p  pThe HTML files I want to parse contain tables with specific bordercolors, trs with specific bgcolors, but the number of elements are dynamic. To validate that the HTML files actually have this specific pattern, I have the following sample pseudocodep  precodepublic function Validate       tables  getalltable, thisgtdata      foreach tables as table          if tablegtbordercolor  navy ampamp tablegtcellspacing  0               Error                   foreach tablesgttr as tr              if trgtbgcolor  fff                   Error                                return true  codepre  pWhere it says  Error, the HTML layout doesnt check out and my class should not attempt to parse it. Traditionally I would do thisp  precodeif tablegtbgcolor  fff      thisgterror  Invalid HTML layout     return false  codepre  pAnd from where I call the method I would usep  precodeif classgtValidate  false      exitwitherrorclassgtGetError  Simple return of thisgterror  codepre  pIve always thought its a decent approach because of its simplicity. However thats also a disadvantage as it doesnt really provide any indepth information of the error apart from the text itself. I cant see where the error was triggered, what methods were called, etc.p  pSince I resumed my PHP hobby I have discovered exceptions. My problem with them is simply that I dont understand how to properly use them. And if I should use them at all. I would like my class to be portable can I use exceptions to handle errors at all And if yes, how can I communicate the errors i.e. translate my traditional error handling Or perhaps there is an even better approach to take, which I dont know about.p  pAny help appreciated p

Negative 65279 pI want to do a concept for a realtime interface for audio interaction, so real low latency is essential. I have read a lot about this topic in the last week, but its impossible to get a real overview in such a short time. So before I dig really deep I need to evaluate the feasibility from this project.p  pIve read a lot about the problems with Android and low latency audio applications and I know that iOS is way superior in this field, but I would prefer Android when its possible. I dont have a mac which is essential for developing iOS, and I just like the more open Andoid more p  pSo my question arep  ol lipIs the bad low latency behaviour only related to actual audio bufferprocessing, or does it affect midi or OSC only applications too For me the interface is the important part  that means its ok for me just to get midiOSC commands which are processed in a separate PC.pli lipI need a low overall latency from the finger touch event to command output. Is this also a problem with Android compared to iOSpli ol
Negative 65279 pIn order to illustrate my problem, take a look at the following fiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netECaD6 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netECaD6ap  pPretend that I have made this webpage where the center dark grey area is the main content of the page.

Negative 65279 pI need to find some way to mock an overload of a function return type in C.p  pI know that there isnt a way to do that directly, but Im hoping theres some outofthebox way around it. Were creating an API for users to work under, and theyll be passing in a data string that retrieves a value based on the string information. Those values are different types. In essence, we would like to let them dop  precodeint  RetrieveValuedataString1 double  RetrieveValuedataString2  Obviously, since they dont know the type, they wouldnt use int .... It would be AnotherFunctionRetrieveValuedataString1  param of type int AnotherFunctionRetrieveValuedataString2  param of type double codepre  pBut that doesnt work in C obviously. Right now, were having it set up so that they callp  precodeint  RetrieveValueIntdataString1 double  RetrieveValueDoubledataString2 codepre  pHowever, we dont want them to need to know what the type of their data string is.p  pUnfortunately, were not allowed to use external libraries, so no using Boost.p  pAre there any ways we can get around thisp  pJust to clarify, I understand that C cant natively do it. But there must be some way to get around it. For example, I thought about doing RetrieveValuedataString1, GetTypedataString1. That doesnt really fix anything, because GetType also can only have one return type. But I need something like that.p  pI understand that this question has been asked before, but in a different sense. I cant use any of the obvious answers. I need something completely outofthebox for it to be useful to me, which was not the case with any of the answers in the other question asked.p

Negative 65279 pI am using Qt Widgets version 4.8.  I am placing QAction objects into a QToolBar.  I am displaying text only, no icons.  The text appears flat with no outline, until one hovers over the text, and then the text appears as a button.  I would prefer to have that button look all the time, and not just on hover.p  pI recognize that the flat look seems standard everywhere, but it is always used with icons. I also recognize that the background shading of the QToolBar makes it apparent that it is a toolbar and therefore contains actions.  However, to everyone that I have shown the application to, it is not apparent to them that there are actions there at all, and I have had management ask me to make it look like a button all the time.p  pI have Qt configured to use the CleanLooks style.  Unfortunately, this does not appear to be defined by a style sheet that I can modify.  If I try to set a style for a QToolButton, this style erases the original style, instead of just updating a single item.  I would need to know all the original values to do this properly.p  pAny answers or suggestionsp

Negative 65279 pWhile Ive tagged this question with SSIS, it is not necessarily core to my question So please keep reading if youre familiar with .NET reflection and code performance issues generally as you may be able to help  p  pBut in particular, the fact that the associated code will be executed many times ie against a data source on a perrow basis is key. p  pIm updating a preexisting custom data flow control.  p  pFor each column in a row, the code must execute a specific method on the codeMicrosoft.SqlServer.Dts.Pipeline.PipelineBuffercode instance row, depending on the column SSIS data type.p  pFor example,p  precodepublic override void ProcessInputint inputID, PipelineBuffer buffer      ...     while buffer.EndOfRowset ampamp buffer.NextRow               ...          someStringAtColumn1  buffer.GetString1          someIntAtColumn2  buffer.GetInt162          someBoolAtColumn3  buffer.GetBoolean3               And so on, for up to 25 different types....            ...  codepre  pBut, the control needs to be dynamic, and hence we dont know at designtime, which type each column will be at runtime.p  pTo that end, the pattern published at a hrefhttpconsultingblogs.emc.comjamiethomsonarchive20070906SSIS3A00Genericmethodforpopulatingapipelinebuffercolumn.aspx relnofollowSSIS Junkie SSIS Generic method for populating a pipeline buffer columna has been used and works.  In summary, this uses a codeSWITCH buffer.GetColumnInfocolumnIndex.DataTypecode to decide which of the 25 methods to call against codebuffercode.p  pstrongSo, my questionsstrongp  ol lipIs repeating this codeSWITCHcode statement for each column number varies for each table, but lets say average of 10 columns for every row potentially millions, likely to cause a significant performance impact in terms of processing timepli lipWould it be better to latebind to the the correct method for each column, on a pertable basis ie embeforeem rowbyrow processing starts, and then executing that columnspecific latebound method against each column during the rowbyrow processing  pli ol  pThe approach I was thinking of would be something likep  precode Set up percolumn latebound methods, once, prior to processing the rows   System.Reflection.MethodInfo[] lateBoundMethods    Psuedo code here for brevity...   foreach column in tableDefinition        lateBoundMethods[i]  getColumnSpecificGetValueMethodcolumn.DataType      End of psuedo code   private System.Reflection.MethodInfo getColumnSpecificGetValueMethodDataType dataType      string methodName        switch dataType              case DataType.DTBOOL             methodName  GetBoolean             break         case DataType.DTBYTES             methodName  GetBytes             break         case DataType.DTCY             methodName  GetDecimal             break              ...          case DataType.DTWSTR             methodName  GetString             break         default             return null TODO Throw an exception           System.Reflection.MethodInfo methodInfo  typeofPipelineBuffer.GetMethod         methodName,         System.Reflection.BindingFlags.ExactBinding          System.Reflection.BindingFlags.Instance          System.Reflection.BindingFlags.Public      return methodInfo   private object getValueFromBufferPipelineBuffer buffer, int columnIndex      if buffer.IsNullcolumnIndex              return null          return lateBoundMethods[columnIndex].Invokebuffer, new object[]  columnIndex  codepre  pAnd then, during row processing, for each column Id simply need to call p  pcodeObject columnValue  getValueFromBufferbuffer, columnIndexcode.p  pSo I guess question 2 comes down to strongIs executing a code.Invokecode against an emalreadyembound codeMethodInfocode going to be faster than executing the big switchcasestrong.p  pstrongEDITstrong I appreciate that reflection is generally considered slow. But as per the bold question above, Im not clear which empartsem of reflection are slow. Im happy to wear poor performance during the preexecution setup phase, so long as calling the latebound methods is quicker than emchoosing which onesem to call while processing rows. So, for any answer stating this will be slow, can you please clarify that you believe it is the invocation of a latebound method that will be slow, vs. the task of identifying which method to bind.p  pI realise that no answer will be as definitive as running some tests... but I was looking for some reasonably authoritative indications up front and before investing significant effort, as deploying an ETL into our TEST environment for performance testing is nontrivial.p  pAlso, Im open to suggestions about other better ways to do this.p  pYour time and input appreciatedp

Negative 65279 pIm following some tutorials to learn openGL from www.opengltutorial.org if it makes any difference and there is an exercise that asks me to draw a cube and a triangle on the screen and it says as a hint that Im supposed to calculate two MVPmatrices, one for each object. MVP matrix is given by ProjectionViewModel and as far as I understand, the projection and view matrices are the same for all the objects on the screen they are only affected by my choice of camera location and settings. However, the model matrix should change since its supposed to give me the coordinates and rotation of the object in the global coordinates. Following the tutorials, for my cube the model matrix is just the unit matrix since it is located at the origin and theres no rotation or scaling. Then I draw my triangle so that its vertices are at 2,2,0, 2,3,0 and 3,2,0. Now my question is, what is the model matrix for my trianglep  pMy own reasoning says that if I dont want to rotate or scale it, the model matrix should be just translation matrix. But what gives the translation coordinates here Should it include the location of one of the vertices or the center of the triangle or what Or have I completely misunderstood what the model matrix isp

Negative 65279 pThis is not actually a question. Im trying to organize what Ive learned about this subject this year. Since I am a beginner in C, I had lots of difficulties doing this. But thanks to Stack Overflow and a lecture about packets in class, I was able to get enough information to write a program using multiple types of packets, and connections. This script is for beginners who do not know what to do about sockets.  p  pThe concept of sending a packet seems to be sending a whole class over the connection. Not writing the data directly to the stream. So, I have to make a DLLClass Library file which defines the packet class, and the derived classes of the packet class. p  pIll write a simple code for the Packet.dll, which will be having one type of packet, the Login class.p  pTo make a DLL file, simply make a C Class Library File on the VS.

So, the Server must be active before executing the client.              this.clienttcpClient  new TcpClient              try                              this.clienttcpClient.Connectlocalhost, 7778                           catch                               MessageBox.ShowConnection Failuren                 return                           this.clientisOnline  true             this.clientNetstream  this.clienttcpClient.GetStream                      private void button1Clickobject sender, EventArgs e                       if this.clientisOnline                 return              login  new Login             login.Type  intPacketType.login Very essential. must be defined for the server to identify the packet.              login.idstr  this.textBox1.Text             login.pwstr  this.textBox2.Text                         Packet.Packet.Serializelogin.CopyTothis.sendBuffer, 0         this.clientNetstream.Writethis.sendBuffer, 0, this.sendBuffer.Length         this.clientNetstream.Flush              for int i  0 i lt 1024  4 i                 this.sendBuffer[i]  0              End of Form1.cs codepre  pAs I said above, this client wont have a receiving thread. So this is all for the client.  It connects to the server on form load, and if you press the button1, the value of textbox1, and textbox2 will be sent to the server as a serialized packet, PacketType of login. On this example the client just sends two variables, but it can send bigger classes such as classes with Lists. p  pThis is all I can explain about socket programming on C using Packets. I tried to make it simple, but I couldnt make it shorter.

Negative 65279 pSo the intial setup for this issue is that theres a JDialog, and inside that Ive placed a JPanel that would house the rest of the components since painting the JDialog itself is apparently a bad idea. This JPanel has an overriden paintComponentGraphics g method that only paints the background and adds a faint border for aesthetic purposes.p  pNow inside that is a series of JPanels that categorize the contained form components, and each JPanel has an overridden paintComponentGraphics g as well, painting a semitransparent background.p  pInside each of those JPanels is where I start to have some issues, presumably with transparency. I have JTextFields, JCheckBoxes, JLabels, JSliders, etc inside these panels, and when you interact with one hover, click, etc, the background goes from transparent to opaque, with an occassional ghosted image from another field which appears slightly random sometimes. Im using a a hrefhttpweblookandfeel.com relnofollowcustom LAF called Weba, but I tested with other builtin LAFs and the same thing happens.p  pIs this a glitch with Java or did I mess something up If so, how can I patch this up I can paste code fragments later if necessary, but Ive used several custom classes and ninepatch style image stitching which may make the code fragments hard to follow. Thanks in advancep

Negative 65279 pIm trying to archive a tree of objects using codeNSKeyedArchivercode. All nodes in the tree support codeNSCodingcode, but I dont have access to the source code, so I cant change anything. However, Id like to include an additional codeNSStringcode with some of the nodes during encoding. When unarchiving, Id like to get that string if available and do some additional setup depending on what that string is.p  pHow could I do this in an elegant way I thought about substituting a subclass when encoding, implementing the additional encoding in the subclass. And make the subclass codeinitWithCodercode return an instance of the superclass, properly initialized and setup. The problem with this is, that I might have real subclasses of the node classes in my tree. And if such a subclass is encoded, the substitution wouldnt work. Or at least I dont see how.p  pCurrently Im looking into subclassing NSKeyedArchiver, but Im not sure where I could inject anything or if this is a good approach at all.p

Negative 65279 pIm a webdesigner and, more than that, a web programmer. Ive been in the business for a while, but so far staying far away from any CMS. p  pLately Im thinking of making things a little bit easier for us by using one. The twothat came to my mind were p  ul liDrupalli liWordpressli ul  pSo far it looks that for any simple, rather static webpage its probably easiest to just use wordpress. But Im not sure of how customizable WP is when it comes to the templates and plugins like galleries I like to use galleria, online shops, maybe even forums etc., and the other compare to it in those aspects. I heard that Drupal demands a coding background, which obviously isnt a problem but rather a plus.p  pThe most important part though still is even if I can code myself, my clients cant. So far we would provide them with an admin area with a text editor, upload section etc. How idiotproof can those two be for the clientp  pThanks for any info amp opinions p

Negative 65279 pI cannot get the atof function to work. I only want the user to input values in the form of decimal numbers until they enter  and it to then break out the loop. I want the values to initially be read in as strings and then converted to doubles because I found in the past when I used this method of input, if you input the number 124 it breaks out of the loop because 124 is the code for the  char. p  pI looked around and found out about the atof function which apparently converts strings to doubles, however when I try to convert I get the message no suitable conversion function from stdstring to const char exists.

Negative 65279 pHold on, this ones going to be rough.  Im attempting to clean up a Mercurial repo that I can only describe as pathological, and it appears the simplest fix is to swap emone directoryem between two branches.  Im not sure if I can adequately explain the situation, but Ill give it a shot.p  pWe have a tool that generates raw source from a large set of input.  Hundreds or thousands of input files, similar number of output files.  This output is then handtweaked and optimized as needed, before being declared ready for deployment.  The tool is run inside a directory that offers the configuration files, etc.p  pSomething likep  precodeproj.hg     input     output     configenv codepre  pNow, what has happened is that a branch was used for the tweaking, instead of the to me logical choice of a shared mq approach.  The team wasnt aware of mq at the time, are mostly CVS trained, but to their credit, they emareem working to improve the workflow.p  pHeres where it gets grody.p  pThe named branch is the emraw outputem branch, and the default branch is the emhand tweakedem branch.p  pThe output of the tool was continually created, then codehg update rawcode, then codehg mergecode, to try and merge tool refinements to the output into the raw branch, then that was merged embackem into the default branch to incorporate both the refinements and prior hand patches, using the merge failure list as the pick list for what needed to be further hand edited.p  pie, theres this crazy cycle between the two branches that has made development a minor nightmare of fragility and errors.  Thats what Im trying to clean out.  What I want is for the default branch to be the raw output, and a new deploy branch that contains the hand patches, with merges going only one way, from default to deploy. Still not optimal, IMO, but until I can convince the powers that be that mq is the way to go, its a rather large improvement.p  pBut.  Theres more.  The configenv and input directories were altered as time went on, but the changes were not kept clean and in sync between the two branches.  The changes to the input and configenv are on the default branch, but the matching raw output is on the raw branch, with stale input and configenv that dont really belong there. Ive inquired about removing the stale files as unnecessary, but there are some arguing that we need to retain them.  For that reason, I want to swap emonly the output directoryem between the two branches.p  pI considered something like codehg convert branchmap swap.txt filemap onlyoutput.txt  datesortcode but then realized I would get only the output directory in the resulting repo.  I emmightem be able to literally strip out the output directories from the two branches into their own repos with the branch names swapped, then merge the two repos together nooutput, outputwithswappedbranches, but I figured that perhaps someone on here would have a better idea.p  pOf course, what Im aiming for is to have one branch with an mq patch list to store the hand patches, and that patch list be part of the shared repo, but babysteps are in order.p  pIf push comes to shove, I think we can eliminate emmostem of the history of the output directories on both branches, but we do require certain tagged releases to be retained on both branches.p

Negative 65279 pFirst post here though longtime readerp  pI have created a setInterval function to check the SESSION[status] variable and then hideshow certain  elements based on the SESSION variables value.

When the user begins to take a quiz on tab A, tab Bs setInterval function should see that the SESSION[status] variable has changed and showhide the relevant  elements to prevent the students from reading pages on the site during a quiz.  When I take a quiz on tab A, tab A hidesshows the correct information.  However, tab B stays the same until I refresh the page and then it does the correct thing.p  pHow can I get tab B to change on its own without refreshingp  pIf it matters, SESSION[status]  1 when browsing and then a value of 0 or above when taking a quiz.p  pThanks in advancep  precodeltscriptgt document.readyfunction  function checklogin      if ltphp echo SESSION[status] gt gt 0                  pagecontainer.hide         quizmsg.show               else                  pagecontainer.show         quizmsg.hide            window.setIntervalchecklogin, 1000   ltscriptgt codepre

Its not that much work to install the SDK, but its the principle of the thing.  The registry settings should work, and automation is better than manual tasks.p

Negative 65279 pIve been struggling with this now for a little while, and I want to make sure Im doing this the right way.  For reference, I am using AutoLayout with Storyboards, and its an iOS7only app.p  pI have a UITableView with a headerview, and the UI for the HeaderView is hooked up in the storyboard.  Ive left the header in the storyboard, and it contains a few elements, one of which is a nonscrollable UITextView.p  pHere is a screenshot of how it basically looks in the storyboardp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comT23HX.png altscreenshotp  pI darkened the headerviews background to a darker grey so it stands out.p  pThe UITextViews text can be dynamic, so its height needs to change depending on the size of the text.  But the tricky part is that the tables headerview needs to adjust its height as well, depending on this texts size.  Ive tried a few different things with constraints, but its not really working correctly unless I disable AutoLayout and resize things programatically, which I really would like to avoid.p  pI want this to be as clean as possible with as little code as necessary, of course.  I am not tied to using the tableview header, although it works well with my needs, since I want it and its containing textview to scroll with the actual details below.  But that all being said, if there is a more simple approach to accomplishing this i.e. with a uilabel, I will gladly change the underlying structure.p  pAny thoughts as to an approach  Not looking for someone to hold my hand through an answer just looking mainly for some good starting points if possible.

Negative 65279 pI am working on project in ASP.NET WEB APPLICATION in which I am having problem with screen Resolution. Whenever I connect my project execution to different devices like from laptop to monitor or to Projector, the fields, labels, drop down lists and other are randomly displaced on the screen. I want to have same display look irrespective of the device on which the out put is being seen. I have seen so many ways but I couldnt find the one which suits my scenario.I want to adjust the out put to be displayed in same way when the resolution is changed that is like from 1024768 to 12801024, etc. I want the out put to be spread across the entire screen in same manner irrespective of the resolution.In the project the resolution for all the controls is declared in measure of pixels not on percentage based.I dont want to change pixels into percentage that makes me to change every where in the project but by keeping them as pixels I want to adjust the resolution whenever it is changed so that the controls will be evenly displaced. Please help me with this.p

Negative 65279 pSo far Ive had great sucess with questionssolutions and obtaining lots of knowledge in excel vba but once again im stuck on a different kind of problem. p  pHere is my scenariop  pWe do samples that are serialized and tracked in an excel vba spreadsheet. Multiple lines can be added and they are identified by the serial number. Each sample sent contains a information sheet that is also serialized. Right now once we enter the serial number into excel, we have to manually enter the serial number onto the information sheet, print, and repeat. This gets frusterating as sometimes we have to send upwards of 40 samples out at a time. p  pMy Ideal Solutionp  pI would like to take the userform I have in place for data entry and use a listbox to record all the samples entered to the spreadsheet. From this, if the user decides to print the sheets he can hit a command button to run a macro. This macro would take the listbox items One at a time and input the information to a specific part on the word template file, and then print it. Rinse and repeat. p  pWhat I am really asking Can anyone provide a generic code for opening a word file from excel, inputting a line in a specified area, and then printing it. I know some VBA now, but this is a bit out of my league, and by a bit waaaay out of it. p  pEdit By specified I ment that I would like to have the option to choose where the text from the list box is placed on the sheet. Ideally it would be the top right hand corner, and middle right hand side. But I would need to adjust the location make it fit perfectly Thanks for the help, A.p

Negative 65279 pSo Im experimenting with closing windowsapps in a vba macro Im writing. Numerous posts online suggest the use of codeFindWindowcode from the windows api.p  pIm starting out slow, Im trying to close a notepad window from my macro. its one of a few things I want but it seems the easiest and I found a solution, I forget where it was posted, it was short and sweet. p  precodeSub CheckNotepad Dim hwnd As Long hwnd  FindWindowNotepad, vbNullString If hwnd Then     MsgBox Notepad is running, the window handle is  amp hwnd Else     MsgBox Notepad is not running End If End Sub codepre  pseems great, its the start of how to get the handle for the notepad window, and from there I could find code to close the window using that handle. But it doesnt work for mep  pAll of the examples I have found use the 2 arguments, I would say half of which use codevbNullStringcode as the second, some of which use a string for the caption of a particular window. But none of it works for me. The only thing that works is supplying a 0 for the second argument I assume this is in place of codevbNullStringcode but if I try to use codevbnullstringcode, or an actual string, I get a type mismatch error. and if I try to use any other number then excel stops working. the lovely Program has stopped working message appears.p  pSo, can give me some advise as to why this happens I could just use the 0, but Im guessing my user will have other notepad windows open so Id like to be able to supply an argument to find the specific notepad window. its going to be a temp window, popped up during the macro and subsequently closed as I do not want it left open for them to seep  pThanks in advance p

Negative 65279 pI have a CSV File which has about 2500 columns and 25,000 rows. I need to build a PHP interface to upload the file to a database. The database is Cassandra which nativity supports amount of data without an issue.p  pI realize that this would take a very long time...... but at the moment that is not an issue.p  pIm a little bit unsure of the best way to proceed. My first instinct was to build a javascript client which simply gives the offset and limit to a php script which uploads the data, 5 rows at a time. This would allow for a visual progress bar for the user and would avoid PHP time outs however Im yet to find a good way to have offsets with csv. Any ifelse methods seem to timeout before the records are even found. p  pDo you have any suggestions Feel free to suggest a different language or method, but the method needs to work through a PHP application that the user can access.p  pThanks, Brianp

Negative 65279 pIve used Google Analytics on several iOS apps. No problems. This time, problem. p  pI do the basic setup using version 3.0. Add libraryheader, include required frameworks, and stuff the boiler plate code into the codeAppDelegate.mcode. So far so good, everything works as expected. I take my first codeUIViewControllercode and change it to extend codeGAITrackedViewControllercode and it hits the fan. The app freezes up on the first screen and memory usage starts going up about 4Meg per second. So I change the codeUIViewControllercode back and all is good. I try making the screen name call manually in codeviewDidLoadcode. p  precode Analytics id tracker  [[GAI sharedInstance] defaultTracker] [tracker setkGAIScreenName valueInitial] [tracker send[[GAIDictionaryBuilder createAppView] build]] codepre  pSame thing happens.

Negative 65279 pIm a doctor with a mostly selftaught programming background, and about a year ago I had this issue with an ultrasound simulator I was working on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14464121making2dcrosssectionalslicesofa3darrayMaking 2D crosssectional slices of a 3D arraya. There were a few great solutions, but it turns out they werent the solutions I really needed probably because I didnt ask for exactly what I needed. After futzing around with it for a while and then realizing it didnt work the way I needed it to, I gave up and got really busy with residency. Anyway, Im back at it once more, so I wanted to see if anyone else could make heads or tails of the problem. Im just pasting the original question below, but modified to reflect the reason it was failing before edits are bolded. Check out the original post above to see the previous answers. Thanks so muchp  pOriginalish Postp  pIm trying to make realtime mockultrasound images from volumetric CT data. The trick is that the user controls the position of the probe, which defines the plane they are seeing.p  pWhat Ive done so far is read the pixel data from all the dicom images into a single 3D array of pixels, and now what I need to do is reslice that 3D array at different angles. Sorry if the following description comes off a little sloppy, but imagine a 3D rectangular box say 100 pixels wide and deep [x,z], and 500 long [y] and a 2D viewing plane say 50 x 50 pixels. Say the starting position of the viewing plane origin defined as the middle point at the close edge of the plane  [0,25] is with the origin at [50,250,0] dead center of the top surface, looking down, oriented left to right and piercing the rectangle straight down. strongThus, the viewing plane has several parameters that can be changed  the location of the origin, and rotation around each of the three axes XY, XZ, and YZ. The tricky bit is that I want to have the rotational axes be relative to the plane itself, not to the box so rotation around the short edge is always rotation around the short edge, regardless of how the short edge is oriented within the 3D array this is necessary because the user input will be in the form of moving or rotating relative to the current position of the plane, not relative to the environment as a whole this is actually a pretty decent, if lame, video that describes the movements I need to make  a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvRskrEsAGzec relnofollowhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvRskrEsAGzeca.strong So the user can change those parameters, and the output is an image built from the pixels touched by the viewing plane.p  pAgain, I apologize if the description is sloppy, but Im a doctor without a strong mathematics background. Any help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 65279 pI am able to build both the iphone and ipad ipa files app.ipa and appipad.ipa fine. However, when I go to deploy them to the Application Center via the nativedeployer api, the Application Center only shows one app of type ios, where I expect two apps, one for iphone and one for ipad.p  pSince this is one worklight project. The applicationdescriptor is the same. The version number and bundle ids are exactly the same. What do I need to change to differentiate them I think if the bundle id is different Application Center will discern them, for sure. But worklight did not change the bundle id when I added the environment, so I left them unchanged.p

The reason is that I could be passing one of two types SimpleChartData or ComplexChartData. These two types both extend a collection as suchp  precode    public class SimpleChartData  ObservableCollectionltChartDataItemgt, IChartData codepre  pand p  precode    public class ComplexChartData  ObservableCollectionltSimpleChartDatagt, IChartData codepre  pMy issue is that if I create an instance of one of these types and add to the collection, then the PropertyChangedCallback function fires as expected. However, if I need to clear the collection, then I just instantiate it as new but the callback function does not fire. I could create a hack everywhere that the control is used but thats obviously not ideal. How can I get the callback to function to fire when the custom type is instantiated. Other suggestions to solve my problem is of course welcome.p

Negative 65279 pIm running into a few issues where I call codeflattencode on an codeAggregateExceptioncode, but inside there is still ANOTHER codeAggregateExceptioncode  This obviously means that they are being propagated up the chain and being rolled into another codeAggregateExceptioncode.

Negative 65279 pI have a PHP web form that accepts file uploads image and text, from which text is extracted OCR and .pdf, .doc, etc stripped to plain text.  The text extraction is performed by using codeexeccode to invoke a jar filecommand line process I am not in control of the source for either which returns the text.  While testing there is no issue, however, with 5 simultaneous PDF uploads each about 5MB the server load maxes out.  The entire process each upload takes 1015 seconds and load drops back to normal immediately after.p  pI am assuming the issue is with Java and allocation to the JRE for each exec call when manually invoking the jar file from the command line it takes about 10 seconds, so nearly the same as a single upload response.  Running the extraction as background processes is not possible because the HTTP response contains the data processed from the uploaded files text.  I considered forking the process, but that doesnt help with the server load will probably make it worse.  I am hoping to avoid rewriting the service entirely in Java.  p  pIs there a way to preload the Java process JRE or pipe successive files to the same, or something of the likep

Negative 65279 pI am building a Node app that talks to an Xbee over serial and readscontrols several sensorsrelays that are also Xbee equipped.

Negative 65279 pId like to create a readonly combobox. The user should not be able to select another item from the popup list. That means that the popup list should not open or should be empty.p  pI see the following solutionsp  ul lipSet a ComboBox model with only one item the current selected item so when the user clicks on the arrow button, an empty list is presented. pli lipAdd a codePopupMenuListenercode and in the codepopupMenuWillBecomeVisiblecode hide the menu. This is problematic We have to call codecombo.hidePopupcode from within a codeSwingUtilities.invokeLatercodepli ul  pThe empty model approach seems a little bit clunky. The second approach shows the popup list for a fraction of a second, short enough to be noticed.

I circumvent this problem by making the combo non focusable. Not ideal but good enough p

Negative 65279 pIs there a way XmlSerializer can be set to ignore all properties which are not explicitly marked to be serializedXmlElement or XmlAttribute etc. I Cant use DataContractSerializer as I need to serialize attributes. XmlIgnore is also not an option as I will be serializing whole object and I dont want it to get corrupt my schema if somebody adds a property to object at some point of time and forgot to mark it with XmlIgnore.p  pManually implementing IXmlSerializer is the last option but very costly as most of my properties will be straightforward primitive types and writing code to save each and every one of these is huge effort.p  pCould there be another way apart from these three or some way to tell XmlSerializer to work on OptIn approachp

Theres a second status value where the animation is also supposed to run, and the status changes to that value after a fixed time interval in which the user has not responded to that item.  The animation is only supposed to stop when the status takes on a value that can only be set by user interaction.p  pWhen the first object is received amp displayed, the animation works fine.  If no further objects are received, the animation keeps running amp the border color changes as intended when the timer expires.p  pHowever, the animation just stops, on its own, after 2 or more objects are received.  This is both before the timer that changes the status that causes the border color to change expires and before any user action is taken.  Note that it doesnt always stop on the second object, it sometimes takes receiving 3 or 4 objects before the animation stops.p  pDoes anyone have any idea why the animation stops  How do I keep each one running to the end  Is there a better way to get the same effect that doesnt have this problemp
Negative 65279 pI have a site where users are prompted to download files from external resources. Since the external file names are hashed and the user downloads multiple files, its very hard for users to know which file they download reaches what resource they requested. For instance, the file name of codefdae442dafe42.zipcode could be codeproductionresources.zipcode.p  pIm looking for ways to have it so the browser will download the file as a different name. Below are some of my ideas and why they wont work, but you may be able to find a workaround.p  pJust a note, I dont have any control over the external resource. I wont be able to make changes to the headers or anything else. My service is a website that mostly targets Desktop Users. Android and iOS solutions wont be that beneficial.p  pstrong Download Attributestrongp  pThis method was working for a while in Google Chrome and Firefox, but then they started to follow the a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRhtml5links.htmldownloadingresourcesW3 HTML5 speca. The external resource requires to send the header of codeContentDispositioncode in which Google Chrome and Firefox didnt check before.p  pstrongPHP Proxy Downloadstrongp  pI know that I could have a PHP script make a request to the external resource and then deliver it to the end user while changing the headers and name to fit my needs. The issue is the site has high traffic and each user downloads about 12GB of data. My servers are not able to handle this type of traffic and upgrading the server will probably be too costly.p  pstrongRename Files with External Applicationstrongp  pI was considering using an external application Possibly a Chrome  Firefox Extension that will rename the files after they finish downloading. But considering a large enough of my audience are one time visitors, asking them to download an application or extension is very unlikely.p  pstrongFlash or Java Embedded Solutionsstrongp  pI am considering using a Java or Flash embedded file that will handle the file downloads, but I dont know enough about either platform. From what I can tell, Flash doesnt have much control over the users file system, so this could be an issue. Java will be able to do this task, but I was really hoping I wouldnt have to use Java since its often insecure and requires a large download to install it same issue as External Software idea.p  hr  pIf you have any ideas on what I could possibly do to solve this issue, they would be greatly appreciated. Im not looking for any code, just ideas on how I will be able to accomplish the above task. I would like to thank you all for your time and expertise. p

Negative 65279 pThis is a bit of a complicated issue, so let me provide some background so you know the full extent of the issue here. I am also rather new to this and it has been a learning experience so far, so I apologise if Im missing something obvious or simple, or if this question is too lengthy and detailed.p  pIm trying to compile a IOS application on, and for, a Raspberry PI. The app is a 3d gamegame engine named Sauerbraten, that I believe would be wonderful to have on the PI for fun, tinkering, and educational use thanks to its low performance requirements, open source nature, and real time map editing.p  pIt uses SDL and GL 1.x, and Ive sucessfully been able to build and run the original source without issue, besides the obvious fact that it runs using software rendering and thus is far too slow to use. Thankfully, someone previously has ported the game to the IPhone, and thus to GLES, so I decided to use that instead of recoding the original version for GLES. p  pSince Im still new to this, I decided to try to compile it first and then see what needs to be changed or fixed. This is where the issue is, Ive run into several issues immediately. First, it seems to be unable to enter subdirectories, or at least find headers in them. If I try to compile it, I get this p  precodepiraspberrypi cubeSaurbratentrunksrc  sudo make make    C enet all make[1] Entering directory homepicubeSaurbratentrunksrcenet binbash .libtool tagCC   modecompile gcc DPACKAGENAMElibenet DPACKAGETARNAMElibenet DPACKAGEVERSION1.3.0 DPACKAGESTRINGlibenet 1.3.0 DPACKAGEBUGREPORT DPACKAGEURL DPACKAGElibenet DVERSION1.3.0 DSTDCHEADERS1 DHAVESYSTYPESH1 DHAVESYSSTATH1 DHAVESTDLIBH1 DHAVESTRINGH1 DHAVEMEMORYH1 DHAVESTRINGSH1 DHAVEINTTYPESH1 DHAVESTDINTH1 DHAVEUNISTDH1 DHAVEDLFCNH1 DLTOBJDIR.libs DHASGETHOSTBYADDRR1 DHASGETHOSTBYNAMER1 DHASPOLL1 DHASFCNTL1 DHASINETPTON1 DHASINETNTOP1 DHASMSGHDRFLAGS1 DHASSOCKLENT1 I.

I hope this question isnt too vague, but at this point Im fresh out of ideas. Ive already asked on the RaspberryPI forums, they recommended installing SDL2, which didnt solve anything, probably since it doesnt use SDL2.p  pEdit I forgot to mention what the enviroment is  Im on Raspbian, effectively debian, using the Make command, no XCode or similar. The source does not have a configure file.p

Negative 65279 pI have been running XAMPP on Windows 2008 R2 for many years now, Im only using Apache, MySql and FileZilla. I have made many custom adjustments and upgraded it serveral times. I have addressed all the security issues I have been able to find. Running as services, the servers are never down as long as Windows Server is up. They are incredible stable. Why on earth do people tell me I should not do this None of the Q or As I have seen here deals with the specifics, most of them ends up in typically its not recommended, its says so on the XAMPP web site, therefore its bad. I understand that you shouldnt use XAMPP out of the box for production because it is not secure. But having changed all root users, using httpscertificate instead of plain http, using MySQL users with limited privileges in my scripts, using prepared statements either PDO or mysqli in php MySQL queries, catching exeptions, handling errors, protecting file folders and the nitty gritty of php programming I cannot see why I cant continue to use XAMPP for production. I have NEVER experienced ANY trouble. I have settled with the perception that security is not the main problem, there must be something else. Maybe scalability or manageability of large websites with millions of users which is not my case Please tell me, but only if know what you are talking aboutp  pEDIT I got a noteworthy comment elsewhere p  blockquote   pIts just not meant to do anything more than development and boutique   use. And the opinion based comments tell you why the exchanges tend to   kick these kind of questions off as people whove worked with XAMPP   and WAMP kind of have been there and werent impressed, but didnt   bother to gather empiric data to back up their opinion.p blockquote  pThis is a fair comment, and it might also be THE best answer I will ever get, but it I can live with that. It is great cue for exploring new computer architectures for my software.p

Negative 65279 pI am using NSight Eclipse to create a library of classes that have CUDA accelerated classes that are intended to be extended and used by a third party application. Lets call my project foo. I want to test foo by writing a 3rd party application in a separate project, including it my test app, and running it. However, when I do this, the test application is unable to find the foo shared library file.p  pI have set the test projects include path to my foos src directory, the test app is requesting the correct library name, and the path to fooDebug is correct. I based my process on the instructions found in a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions24575677includeastaticcudalibraryintoacproject2461883724618837this postinga.p  pI have verified that foo is generating a shared library artifact, and that the fPIC flag is checked. p  pI can compile both projects, so it appears that the settings are indeed correct, but when I actually attempt to run the test project, I get the message error while loading shared libraries foo.so cannot open shared object file No such file or directory.  But when I look at the fooDebug directory, I can see the file libfoo.so there.p  pI have tried changing foo to be a static library too, but that yields the same error message.p  pWhat is going on and what can I do to fix itp  pThanks for your help. p

Negative 65279 pIm converting a xib based app to use story boards. My app has both view controllers and service level objects. For example, I have an object that manages communications with servers and another object that manages access to the devices photo libraries. p  pWith xib files I could inject proxy objects and wire them up. But with storyboards there is no such option. Nor does it appear that I can access the app delegate from the storyboard or gain access to any objects instantiated by the storyboard. In summary, it appears that the story board is closed off from the app delegate. p  pThere are two approaches I can see, 1 is to instantiate everything in the storyboard and somehow gain access to the objects from outside the storyboard. The second is to be able to  inject objects into the storyboard when it is created. p  pSo far Ive not been able to do either of these things. Does anyone know how to deal with this situationp

Negative 65279 pThere is an interesting article on how to extend the Joomla Gantry template to allow for text logos. Here is the URLp  pa hrefhttpwww.tkstudiodesign.comarticlesgantryframeworkitem27textlogositeslogan relnofollowhttpwww.tkstudiodesign.comarticlesgantryframeworkitem27textlogositesloganap  pI followed the instructions to the best of my understanding. I created a feature file which I called textlogo.php, I added the two variables to the styledeclaration.php file where the author said I should add them, and I created another file containing the last piece of code in the article which I called textlogo.less. The only problem I had was with the custom styling classes 3rd piece of coding in the article which I didnt know exactly where to place so I placed them in my custom CSS file in Gantry. I compiled the textlogo.less file to generate CSS code and cleared the gantry cache at the end. However, I still get the following errorp  pError 0  Less Parse Error failed to parse passed in variable logotexttextcolorp  pThis variable, BTW, is one of the two variables added to the styledeclaration.php file as mentioned above.p  pI only applied minimal changes to the code, modifying some variable names slightly to reflect my website as well as the text to be displayed.p  pMy website is now down because of the error and the only way to bring it back up would be to delete all the changes and files I added. I dont want to do that for the time being since it took me a long time of painstaking entering and deleting trying to solve little problems along the way, and my editor doesnt allow for cut and paste.p  pSo if anybody can help with this matter, I would appreciate it greatly.p  pBest regards to all.p  pFurther Notep  pThanks to Bass Jobsen for pointing out the possibility of a typo in styledeclaration.php.

The other two are original to the template. I would have liked to show a picture of the file but I cannot post images as I am still new here without enough reputation. I hope this helps.p  pFurthermore, the following is the textlogo.css file generated from the compilation of the textlogo.less file. I also noticed that while the original less file had a reference to the variable in question, the generated css file does not there is no value for color after the colon.

Make sure to checkpoint only when you are finished processing all the events in each batch.p blockquote  pWhile we know that there will be some results in the messages enumerable, the documentation is silent on whether or not we can expect concurrent calls to ProcessEventsAsync or a second call while the first is in progress. Given the instructions on when to checkpoint neither would make much sense as the second call could complete and checkpoint further along in the stream than is processed since the first doesnt complete, but confirmation in the documentation would be great.p  pI assume that the output of each call to a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryazuremicrosoft.servicebus.messaging.ieventprocessorfactory.createeventprocessor.aspx relnofollowCreateEventProcessora or IEventProcessor if they are unique is used by the EventProcessorHost for one partition, and that the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryazuremicrosoft.servicebus.messaging.partitioncontext.aspx relnofollowPartitionContextap  pSimilarly is whether a call to a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryazuredn751578.aspx relnofollowCheckpointAsynca has any effect on a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryazuremicrosoft.servicebus.messaging.ieventprocessor.processeventsasync.aspx relnofollowProcessEventsAsynca being called.

Negative 65279 pIm using a Command Handler pattern and binding with ninject.extensions.Conventions, which is working great when my actual IQueryHandlerlt, interface implementation matches a single concrete type.

They can bep  precodeFirstName LastName FirstName MiddleInitial LastName FirstName MiddleInitial. LastName LastName, FirstName MiddleInitial. codepre  pWhich covers MOST of the cases.  But Im just trying to evaluate the first pattern to start with, if it matches FirstName LastName.p  pSo, Ive triedp  precodeCASE Expressions codepre  ul licodeREGEXPLIKEname, SsScode  and gotten true for all, even those with 2 whitespaces within the name, like in the case of FirstName MiddleInitial LastName.li licodeREGEXPLIKEname, [s]s[s]code and gotten true for all, I thought the [s] would exclude whitespace from being allowed anywhere but once between the first name and last name.li licodeREGEXPLIKEname, [AZ,az] [AZ,az]code and gotten false for all tried to use the Posix version instead of Perl influenced.li ul  pIve probably tried about 10 other variations of this too but I cant remember or type them all out. Im hoping someone could just get me started on the first matching case of FirstName LastName and then Ill get it and go from therep

Negative 65279 pstrongVersionsstrongp  pPython 3.4 with Pygame 1.9.2p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pHow can I pass the name of a functionmethod from one module, where this function does NOT exist, to the module containing it without having to resort to making it a string and evaluating it by evalp  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI have a simple MVC pattern for training purposes. For simplicitys sake lets just presume we pressed a button in the menu. Heres what happensp  pThe controller sends our event, the click as ClickEvent containing position, mouse button and if the button was pressed or released, to the currently running logic, the menu. The menu then evaluates the click depending on its position and if it happened on a button, it returns a ModelEvent containing the name of a method of the model. The model then receives said ModelEvent and evaluates it. If any visible changes happen, it creates a new ViewEvent this would go beyond my question.p  pstrongApproachesstrongp  pI approached the problem in three ways so far, once by lambda which doesnt seem to fit my needs at all or I horribly misunderstood it and twice by using strings with eval. The shortcomings of the latter approach are obvious The name of the function has to be passed between the instances as a string and then evaluated by eval which takes its time.p  pWhat would be an efficient way to pass the names of methods and functions from one module, where they dont exist, to another, where they are to be executed, without having to use strings and evalp  pOr, if you see any grave mistakes in my general approach, Id be glad to hear about it as Im still learning.p

Negative 65279 pstrongWHAT I WANT TO DOstrong  Basically i want to do the human touch pragmatically at specific time at specific X,Y Coordinates  Run a service which will receive the X,Y coordinates via some interface TCPUDP  fire dispatchTouchEvent using those coordinates and get the results as actual human finger click gives  I mean focussed activity might be anything either it is Android Home Screen OR Any opened activity OR Anything  The moment service invokes the dispatchTouchEvent, It should perform the click.   For example if opened App is calculator and X,Y coordinates of dispatchTouchEvent points to numeric 5, It should press the 5 keyp  pstrongWHAT I HAVE DONE TILL NOWstrong  I have started a service which receives X,Y coordinates  On some trigger, it invokes the dispatchTouchEvent, but it does not work. It does not click anything on the screen.  It capture every touch event made by human finger.p  pstrongWHATS THE ISSUEstrong  How to issue dispatchTouchEvent to any underlay activityp  pstrongSAMPLE CODEstrong i am attaching the sample code here. I have just made it simple for test purpose. First we need to click anywhere in the screen. Its X,Y coordinates will be saved and after some time dispatchTouchEvent will be invoked using same coordinates.p  pemMainActivity.javaemp  precodepackage com.test.overlay import android.os.Bundle import android.app.Activity import android.content.Intent  public class MainActivity extends Activity       Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         Intent intent  new Intentthis, Overlay.class         Intent intent  new Intentthis, PlayerServiceTest.class         startServiceintent         finish       codepre  pemOverlay.javaemp  precodepackage com.test.overlay import android.annotation.SuppressLint import android.app.Service import android.content.Context import android.content.Intent import android.graphics.Canvas import android.graphics.Paint import android.graphics.PixelFormat import android.graphics.Typeface import android.os.AsyncTask import android.os.Build import android.os.IBinder import android.os.SystemClock import android.view.Gravity import android.view.MotionEvent import android.view.ViewGroup import android.view.WindowManager import android.widget.Toast  SuppressWarningsdeprecation public class Overlay extends Service       HUDView mView       Override     public IBinder onBindIntent intent          return null           Override     public void onCreate          super.onCreate         Toast.makeTextgetBaseContext,onCreate, Toast.LENGTHLONG.show         mView  new HUDViewthis                   WindowManager.LayoutParams params  new WindowManager.LayoutParams                 WindowManager.LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT, WindowManager.LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT,                 WindowManager.LayoutParams.TYPESYSTEMALERT,                 WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGWATCHOUTSIDETOUCH,                 WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGLOCALFOCUSMODE  WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGWATCHOUTSIDETOUCH,                 WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGNOTFOCUSABLE  WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGNOTTOUCHMODAL  WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGWATCHOUTSIDETOUCH,                 PixelFormat.TRANSLUCENT                        WindowManager.LayoutParams params  new WindowManager.LayoutParams                 WindowManager.LayoutParams.TYPESYSTEMOVERLAY,                 WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGWATCHOUTSIDETOUCH,                 PixelFormat.TRANSLUCENT                    WindowManager.LayoutParams params  new WindowManager.LayoutParams                 WindowManager.LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT,                 WindowManager.LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT,                 WindowManager.LayoutParams.TYPESYSTEMOVERLAY,                 0,                 WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGNOTFOCUSABLE  WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAGNOTTOUCHABLE,                 PixelFormat.TRANSLUCENT                  params.gravity  Gravity.RIGHT  Gravity.TOP         params.setTitleLoad Average         WindowManager wm  WindowManager getSystemServiceWINDOWSERVICE         wm.addViewmView, params           Override     public void onDestroy          super.onDestroy         Toast.makeTextgetBaseContext,onDestroy, Toast.LENGTHLONG.show         ifmView  null                      WindowManager getSystemServiceWINDOWSERVICE.removeViewmView             mView  null                 class HUDView extends ViewGroup       private Paint mLoadPaint      public HUDViewContext context               supercontext         Toast.makeTextgetContext,HUDView, Toast.LENGTHLONG.show          mLoadPaint  new Paint         mLoadPaint.setAntiAliastrue         mLoadPaint.setTextSize10         mLoadPaint.setTextSize25         mLoadPaint.setTypefaceTypeface.SANSSERIF         mLoadPaint.setTypefaceTypeface.DEFAULTBOLD         mLoadPaint.setARGB255, 25, 200, 50           Override     protected void onDrawCanvas canvas               super.onDrawcanvas         canvas.drawTextTHIS IS TEST, 15, 115, mLoadPaint            Override     protected void onLayoutboolean arg0, int arg1, int arg2, int arg3, int arg4               System.out.printlnonLayout called ...         handleAutoTouches              SuppressLintNewApi     public void TestThread                AsyncTaskltVoid, Void, Voidgt task  new AsyncTaskltVoid, Void, Voidgt                          Override             protected void onPreExecute                               System.out.printlnpost0...

Negative 65279 pIs there a way of calling a method inside a fragment once all UI elements are displayed I am having trouble at the moment trying to figure out which method in the fragment lifecycle should I put my code in. Basically, I am waiting for some input on my socket by calling codeinStream.readbuffercode where codeinStreamcode is an codeinputStreamcode and buffer is a codebyte[]code already initialised. My problem is that this call prevents the UI from being fully displayed whether I call it in onResume, onStart, onActivityCreated it always waits until it has received something before the UI is fully displayed. Is there a specific fragment lifecycle method for this So the socket kinda works in the background just waiting for input instead of hogging the foreground, since the data received will be used to fill some textboxes in the UI of the fragment.p

Negative 65279 pIm making an application which takes in a users tweets using the Twitter API and one component of it is performing sentiment extraction from the tweet texts. For development Im using xampp, of course using the Apache HTML Server as my workspace. Im using Eclipse for PHP as an IDE.p  pFor the sentiment extraction Im using the a hrefhttpwww.uclassify.combrowseuClassifySentiment relnofollowuClassify Sentiment Classifiera. The Classifier uses an API to receive a number of requests and with each request it sends back XML data from which the sentiment values can be parsed.p  pNow the application may process a large number of tweets maximum allowed is 3200 at once. For example if there are 3200 tweets then the system will send 3200 API calls at once to this Classifier. Unfortunately for this number the system does not scale well and in fact xampp crashes after a short while of running the system with these calls. However, with a modest number of tweets for example 500 tweets the system works fine, so I am assuming it may be due to large number of API calls. It may help to note that the maximum number of API calls allowed by uClassify per day is 5000, but since the maximum is 3200 I am pretty sure that it is not exceeding this number. p  pThis is pretty much my first time working on this kind of web development, so I am not sure if Im making a rookie mistake here. I am not sure what I could be doing wrong and dont know where to start looking.

Negative 65279 pwhat is the fastest way to read a line of characters from console input into characters vector or array I would prefer vector, since line could be pretty long and I am not familiar with dynamic arrays, so normal arrays could cause stack overflow. I do not know the size of my characters line and after the characters in another line there are some numbers. I used string, but my programme exceeded time limit of problem Im trying to solve, therefore I am thinking that it might be because char[] is faster than string at some operations. I need to sort my line and I am already using quickSort algorythm.p

Negative 65279 pIve been trying to get this done for a few hours now without any luck. Im pretty new to Unity3D and C so that could be the reason why I cant seem to make it work.p  pI have a canvas, and a round button added to it that acts like a joystick. On the button, in the inspector menu, I have 2 Event Triggers, one for Drag and one for End Drag. Each calls its own separate function StartDrag and EndDrag which work just fine, making the joystick work properly.p  pThe issue Im having, is that if I add a new button, say for a jumping action, if I press it while Im using the joystick, the button from the joystick doesnt keep its position, it gets affected by the new touch messing up the movement. Bellow you can see the code that does work for the joystick. How can I add more buttons for other actions without messing up my joystick Thank you very much in advance and if possible, please keep in mind that my C and Unity experience is very limited.p  precodeusing UnityEngine using System.Collections  public class JoystickMovement  MonoBehaviour   private Vector3 joystickcenter public GameObject Player public PlayerData playerDataScript  void Start       joystickcenter  transform.position   public void StartDrag     float x  Input.mousePosition.x     float y  Input.mousePosition.y      Vector3 joyPosition  Vector3.ClampMagnitudenew Vector3 xjoystickcenter.x, yjoystickcenter.y, 0, 80  joystickcenter     transform.position  joyPosition   public void ResetDrag     transform.position  joystickcenter     Player.rigidbody.velocity  Vector3.zero   void FixedUpdate        ifplayerDataScript.playerStatus  dead              ResetDrag           if playerDataScript.playerStatus  alive               Player.rigidbody.velocity  Vector3.ClampMagnitudePlayer.rigidbody.velocity, 4         Player.rigidbody.AddRelativeForce new Vector3transform.position.x  joystickcenter.x, 0, transform.position.y  joystickcenter.y        codepre  pp

I get the following outputp  precodemain x 6, y 7, z 5 func x 7, y 8, z10 main x 6, y 8, z 5 func x 9, y 9, z10 main x 6, y 9, z 5 func x 6, y10, z10 main x 6, y10, z 5 codepre  pI can understand where the first line comes from. Its just the values of the global variables, but main is using 5 rather than 10 because the global variable shadows the local variable. I can also understand line 2. global variable x is passed into func, giving a 7. Global variable y is used also, giving an 8.p  pLine 3 is where I lose track of values. Why has the value of global variable y stayed as 8 Did the func function call change its value permanently I thought this was not possible since y in func is just a local variable. I understand where the x  6 comes from in line 3 though.p  pLine 4 I lose track even more. How can the value of x jump from 6 to 9p  pIt would be great if someone could walk me through this output, and perhaps give me a quick explanation on scope and also on shadowing.p

Negative 65279 pI want to know one thing how accurate is the Xcode iOS simulator in representing the actual run time on a physical device I recently tested an app with a 6.1 deployment target on a device running 6.1 iPad 2. So far I had been testing on an iPad mini running 8.2 after building the app in Xcode 6.2 and scaling back the deployment target from 7.1 but was shocked to see that the buttons I made didnt load at all on my physical iPad 2. The buttons instead loaded as blank old school iPhone buttons and when I clicked some of them, they crashed the app even though their only functionality was to perform a basic segue.p  pShould I update my iPad 2 to 8.28.3 and try again I guess I am asking because the iPad 2 isnt technically mine and the owner doesnt want me to update it in fear of loosing data so Im in a pickle as far as conceiving my next step in development . Does this problem sound at all familiar to anyone or should I just save up and buy my own 2nd testing device and hope for the best p

But we are facing serious problem with this approach. At this point we have 41 GWT modules being compiled as dependencies of our main module with more that 3GB of ram and taking 812 minutes. We are expecting to have more that 400 modules at the end of the current development phase, and it will become unsustainable in terms of computer power to compile the application. p  pWe already took a look on some articles like Ben Northrops one at a hrefhttpwww.summatech.comblog20110222structuringgwtmodulesforlargeapplicationshttpwww.summatech.comblog20110222structuringgwtmodulesforlargeapplicationsa.

Negative 65279 pBack in the old days, when I was a smartaleck kid, my office had 12 sheets of black construction paper beside the fax machine. When some loosewitted tool sent us a spam fax, we would punch up the return fax number and send back 12 pages of blackness. The idea was that they should know that if they wanted to tell us about their new cleaning product, it would cost them 12 pages of thermal paper each time. It workedp  pJump ahead 30 years.

Negative 65279 pI am trying to get deeper into android internals, I know how to use NDK, maybe even how it works, but I have question about Native Activity and other native parts provided by NDK.br As far as I know Android Desktop Environment graphical envirnoment is written and running in Java. This is the part of Android Frameworkblue color on wellknown diagramm.br If so, when running CC code from android app we are running it on the linux level, behind the java, dalvik and all high level stuff.br My question is how can we have NativeActivity, to create it draw with opengl is one thing, but where is it in android system architecture is it still running somehow inside dalvik process instance.br The main thing I am interested in is how communication with simple java activities is done.br Please help to understand , maybe someone can provie a sort of diagramm to get better understanding of this.br Thx in advance.p

Negative 65279 pSo my question was emkind ofem addressed by a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions15213081howcanyoutellifagithubpullrequesthasbeenreleasedthis posta, but Im still a little confused.  Basically, Im checking out a repo on GitHub, and I see that there are currently 34 open and 173 closed pull requests.  My current understanding is thisp  ol liIf somebody makes a stupid pull request, the maintainers will close itli liIf somebody makes a legit pull request, the maintainers may merge it, at which point the request is closedli liIf a request is open legit or not then that means the maintainers just havent dealt with it yet or are in the process of resolving conflictsli ol  pHowever, a lot of the open requests in this repo are very old, even though they seem to make reasonable changes.  This makes me wonder whether my 2nd assumption above is correct.  So which is it, do pull requests close when they are merged, or do they remain open  And if they remain open, how can I tell that they were in fact merged, and arent just in limbop  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 65279 pThis is really silly, but its driving me nuts p  pNormally when I run ipython notebook through pycharm, the first time I click on the play button to run a cell, PyCharm asks me if I want to start the kernel.

Negative 65279 pIm building a Node app with React, Fluxible and PostgreSQL via Sequelize. Requests are handled via Express. Runtime is io.js 2.5.p  pIm mentioning that stuff because I wasam concerned that I have a memory leak, and havent been able to pinpoint whether its just a product of Nodeio or something in the stack my first thought was unresolved Promises.p  pMy app starts at 90mb RAM usage, and after pummelling it with 100k requests via gobench, quickly jumps to over 1GB. Weirdly, this doesnt happen in a linear fashion  i.e. more requests doesnt seem to equal more RAM  I can throw 1,000 more http hits, and see RAM actually emdropem by 100mb... maybe just coincidentally tied with GCp  pIn any case, it never drops anywhere close to its original level  if it gets to 1GB, it stays between 800mb1GB. Ive tried codeheapdumpcode  Chrome Dev Tools to analyse to figure out mem usage, but cant see anything obvious.p  pThen I tried the vanilla HTTP example in the Node docs....p  precodevar http  requirehttp http.createServerfunction req, res    res.writeHead200, ContentType textplain   res.endHello Worldn .listen1337, 127.0.0.1 console.logServer running at http127.0.0.11337 codepre  p... and saw that the 9.5mb initial mem usage quickly rose to 60mb, and despite handling all the requests, never dropped down. So 6x RAM usage, despite there being no active connections.p  pDoes this sound like a memory leak, or does Node simply allocate a bunch of RAM when it needs it, and is hesitant to give it back to the OSp  pIf its the latter  how do I best handle that At the moment Im using codepm2code and just restarting the process when it grows to 1GB, but that seems a bit heavy handed.p  pThanks for any advice.p

Negative 65279 pBased on the posted screenshots, the drawing on the top was created using canvas and the drawing on the bottom was created using XML. The XML drawing is exactly what I want but unfortunately due to Androids too many views warning its not a good idea for me to use it   As regards to the canvas drawing is there something that Im missing or not doing right that is causing the drawing to not look exactly like the XML one or do I have to rely on values Ive tried numerous different ways such as changing values of widths and spacing etc. and I STILL had no luck.
