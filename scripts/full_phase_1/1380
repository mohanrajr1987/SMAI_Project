Positive 1380 pI have the following setup Im mocking nonabstract class with PHPUnit, but not all of its methods.

How can I point that the codedoStuffcode method exists and requires proper argumentsp  pcodemethodcode seems to be working only within class definition. I tried to play a bit with codeseecode but was unable to resolve the matter. Also, the ideal solution would be the one that allows to specify hinting also within return statements as I may want to return mocks from test helpers methods.p  pCheap cheat is to hint with the original class, but that I do not want to do since then I will lose the point  which is mock and which is not. This especially is important since Im using helpers to build complex entities where mocks are injected.p

Binding the console function to a prototype and then instantiating, rather than binding it directly to the object, doesnt help.p  pI could, of course, just call codeconsole.debugcode from an anonymous function assigned to code.logcode, but then Id lose my line numbers.

Negative 1380 pI am working on a SVG application and now want to let a user resize an object using draggable corners, very much like in SVGedit httpsvgedit.googlecode.comsvntrunkeditorsvgeditor.html.

Negative 1380 pIm writing some objects which make extensive use of the filesystem. Im not sure what is the right way to test them.p  pI know in theory I should abstract filesystem functionality in some objects and then mock them, but it would be quite pointless in my case the main use of the classes I want to test is to manage files. So I would have the same problem when testing the new objects, just shifted one level.p  pThe only way I can think to make the tests is to actually work with the filesystem. The problem is that tests will be ran both in the browser and on the command line, and so I need to work in a directory with write access by everyone. Moreover, this does not seem to be a very portable solution.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 1380 pWe are using the GWTPresenter framework and attempting to use CellTable to put together an updateable grid. It seems as though several of the GWT constructs for CellTable dont lend themselves to easily breaking up the logic into clean view and presenter code. p  pExamples 1 Within the Views constructor, the CellTable is defined and each column is created by anonymous inner classes that extend the Column class to provide the onValue method. 2 The FieldUpdater interface must be implemented to provide logic to execute when a user alters data in a cell. This seems like it would best fit in the Presenters onBind method, but FieldUpdaters often need access to the Cell or Column which belong in the view. CellTable does not have accessor methods to get hold of the Columns or Cells, so it seems the only way for the Presenter to get them is for me to create a multitude of member variables on the View and accessors on my Display interface.p  pCan anyone provide good examples for dealing with CellTable in GWTPresenter or a comparable MVP p

Negative 1380 pSo I am attempting to retrieve the files from a workspace in TFS.  Unfortunately, every attempt that I have made to do this results in a stalled application.

All the files in TFS are not locked, everything is fine.  Attempting to use the codeWorkspace.Getcode method results in the same thing.  p  pIf I hit pause, x will be a specific value, but I cant access the items collection, as when I do I get Cannot evaluate expression because the current thread is in a sleep, wait, or join.

What I am confused about is p  p1 Why is this trying to pull the application code from TFS when I am specifying a completely different TFS workspacep  p2 Why is this stalling after attempting to retrieve the file  Its possible that its because codefmMain.cscode is open in Visual Studio, but it should still exception out and not get hung up.

Negative 1380 pI am currently trying to improve the performance of a web application. The goal of the application is to provide codereal time analyticscode. We have a database model that is similiar to a codestar schemacode, few fact tables and many dimensional tables. The database is running with codeMysqlcode and codeMyIsamcode engine.br The Fact table size can easily go into the upper millions and some dimension tables can also reach the millions.br Now the point is, select queries can get awfully slow if the dimension tables get joined on the fact tables and also aggretations are done. First thing that comes in mind when hearing this is, why not precalculate the data This is not possible because the users are allowed to use several freely customizable filters.  p  pSo what I need is an allinone system suitable for every purpose  Sadly it wasnt invented yet. So I came to the idea to combine 2 existing systems. Mixing a coderow orientedcode and a codecolumn orientedcode database e.g. like codeinfinidbcode or codeinfobrightcode. Keeping the mysql MyIsam solution for fast inserts and row based queries and add a column oriented database for fast aggregation operations on few columns to it and fill it periodically nightly via cronjob. Problem would be when the current data it must be real time is queried, therefore I maybe would need to get data from both databases which can complicate things.p  pFirst tests with infinidb showed really good performance on aggregation of a few columns, so I really think this could help me speed up the application.  p  pSo the question is, is this a good idea Has somebody maybe already done this Maybe there is are better ways to do it.  p  pI have no experience in column oriented databases yet and Im also not sure how the schema of it should look like. First tests showed good performance on the same codestar schema likecode structure but also in a codebig table likecode structure.p  pI hope this question fits on SO.p

Negative 1380 pWe are looking for some recommendations around systematically reindexing in Solr an ever growing corpus of documents tens of millions now, hundreds of millions in than a year without taking the currently running index down. Reindexing is needed on a periodic bases becausep  ul liNew features are introduced around searching the existing corpus that require additional schema fields which we cant always anticipate in advanceli liThe corpus is indexed across multiple shards. When it grows past a certain threshold, we need to create more shards and rebalance documents evenly across all of them which SolrCloud does not seem to yet support.li ul  pThe current index receives very frequent updates and additions, which need to be available for search within minutes. Therefore, approaches where the corpus is reindexed in batch offline dont really work as by the time the batch is finished, new documents will have been made available.p  pThe approaches we are looking into at the moment arep  ul liCreate a new cluster of shards and batch reindex there while the old cluster is still available for searching. New documents that are not part of the reindexed batch are sent to both the old cluster and the new cluster. When ready to switch, point the load balancer to the new cluster.li liUse CoreAdmin spawn a new core per shard and send the reindexed batch to the new cores. New documents that are not part of the reindexed batch are sent to both the old cores and the new cores. When ready to switch, use CoreAdmin to dynamically swap cores.li ul  pWed appreciate if folks can either confirm or poke holes in either or all these approaches. Is one more appropriate than the other Or are we completely off Thank you in advance.p

Negative 1380 pSo I have a 3d object that I created and imported into XAML format and into Viewport3d. We have another C object that is used from a book. The issue is that it is a parent object and trying to put the code behind file under the new object in C creates a parent vs. parent conflict. I decided to make a c class out of it as I need multiple instances of the object. Ive been translating all the XAML code to C but Im stuck at the positions, normals, amp texture coordinates of the XAML object. If there was an easier workaround instead of translating it, it would make my day. Can anyone help please It would be much appreciated. p

Negative 1380 pMost services, programs, etc. have various password complexity checks. Without delving into the a hrefhttpxkcd.com936 relnofollowefficacy of such checksa, I thought of one that might be interesting, but also potentially problematic checkp  pstrongThe new password must be codeYcode characters different from the last codeXcode passwords.strongp  pThis would prevent people from using passwords like codePassword1code, codePassword2code, and so on. But if thats done, one cannot hash the previously used password  they would be at best encrypted... Rightp  pFor a small codeYcode and a fairly short password, you could probably still store the hash and bruteforce all codeYcode letter variations of the new password, but this gets unfeasible as codeYcode and the password length grows. p  pMy original idea is this since when you change the password you must provide your original password, hash the new password and store and the old one in encrypted form. Now its reversible.p  pSo assuming an active password is always hashed, is there a better way to do this And also does having this in place emincreaseem or emdecreaseem the security of the applicationp

Negative 1380 pI have an application with many MDI child windows. Normally, the user is able to bring one MDI child window to the front by clicking on both the client and nonclient areas of the window. This seems to normally happen as soon as the mouse button is down.p  pNow, what emsometimesem happens is that when the user clicks an MDI child form on its client area, the window does strongnotstrong come to the front as expected. Clicking on the title bar of the form, however, does bring the window to the front, but only when the mouse button is released. This has the effect that the user can drag one MDI child window embehindem another, and when releasing the mouse button, the dragged window comes to the front.p  pThe effect is that if I have several MDI child windows partially overlapping one another, I cannot bring a window to the front like I normally can. This seems to be independent of the focus  an MDI child window can have focus, but still be embehindem another MDI child window.p  pMoreover  this seems to happen randomly, after using the application for a while.

It seems like this must be a problem that is encountered all the time.p  pI have a hardware thread and a processing thread.p  pThe hardware thread is run in a closed binary library that I dont have access to.p  pThe processing thread registers a callback with the hardware thread to be notified of certain rare events related to state changes in the hardware.p  pI wish to be able to notify the event loop in the processing thread that the state has changed. Id like to do this without requiring a dependance on an external library or in a non portable way, and without using locks as I have no idea when the hardware thread may want to notify the processing thread again.p  pSo, my thinking at present as to how to solve this is something like as followsp  precodeinclude ltsignal.hgt   sigatomict is used so update is always in a sane state static volatile sigatomict update  0   called from hardware thread int callbackfunction      update  1    called regularly from processing thread int processingfunction      static sigatomict localupdate  0  The same type as update      if localupdate  update         updateinternalhardwarestate  We necessarily call once per callback         localupdate  1       codepre  pClearly this is going to break if ever codeupdatecode wraps around and just happens to reach the value of codelocalupdatecode before codeprocessingfunctioncode is next called though almost certainly I can assume this will never happen.p  pHave I missed something subtle or not so subtle herep  pIs there a better way to solve this whole problemp  pThe callback can be assumed to be only ever called from one thread the hardware thread.p

Negative 1380 pActually, Im already able to generate timestamps and it works with some filters muxers but since I want to be able to use codeGDCL MP4 Multiplexer Filtercode, I want to discuss my method of calculating sample time values.p  pWeird thing is, if I put codeSmart Tee Filtercode between my codeRTSP Source Filtercode and codeGDCL MP4 Multiplexer Filtercode everything seems to by working. Im able to capture video streams correctly. But without codeSmart Tee Filtercode, im still able to capture video but this time with periodic glitches. As far as I know, codeSmart Tee Filtercode doesnt do much except giving double output pins, one with timestamps capture pin and one without timestamps preview pin and both pins share the same stream buffer. So, the thing came to my mind was somehow codeSmart Tee Filtercode is reorganizing things like timestamps. But if I dont generate timestamps, codeSmart Tee Filtercode doesnt generate those values, either. My current guess is, Im calculating frame start times correctly but frame stop times incorrectly and codeSmart Tee Filtercode is recalculating frame stop times as they should be this is just a guess of course.p  pI used to calculate start and stop times like the formula below.p  precodestartTime  now timeDelta  now  previousFrame endTime  startTime  timeDelta codepre  pThis is not the exact formula but it was something close.

Negative 1380 pIm getting strange behaviour from WPF codeListBoxcode.p  pMy codeListBoxcode is displaying an observable collection of Attributes, each attribute has a string property called factoryfriendlyname. The value of factory friendly name is always unique. When I click on an item in the list box, the selection changed event is fired, and the item in question is selected. p  pThe problem is at the same time it will also select two or three other items with no apparent connection, and will then not fire selection changed for any further selections. p  pIf I do make further selections, the items are highlighted as if they are being selected, but selected items changed is not fired again. Rather than selecting a new node, further selections are added onto existing ones, so every time I click, another item turns blue.p  pI really can understand what is going on with the codeListBoxcode.p  pXamlp  precodeltListBox ItemsSourceBinding ToolBoxItems          Namenodelist Grid.Column0          Grid.Row1 SelectionModeSingle          SelectionChangedDoSelectionChanged          DisplayMemberPathFactoryFriendlyNamegt codepre  pcodeDoSeletionChangedcode simply loads the selected item.

Negative 1380 pI have been having issues with a custom check box control for a while now and had posted this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7092497howtoexposeeventsinawinformscustomcontrolQuestion...a It appears that the problem isnt related to the events.p  pThe custom control is a group box with a check box. When the check box is false, all the group controls should be disabled. It sounds simple but the problem is that when an internal control loses focus, the checked change event is fired.p  pAfter a bit more digging I think I have narrowed it down to the binding of the checked property to another object.

Negative 1380 pFolks,p  pI have a web page that has an HTML table generated by an ASP.NET control.  The top row of the table emulates a toolbar.  That top row is laid out sort of like thisp  precodelttrgt   lttd stylewhitespacenowrapgt     ltspangtVery long titleltspangtampnbsp   lttdgt   lttdgt      bunch of hyperlinks with background images, emulating a toolbar    lttdgt lttrgt codepre  pI am stuck with the fact that this is a table, with the contents of the title area being put in a span, and probably with that inline style specifying no wrapping.  p  pThis table is supposed to narrow itself when the page narrows, and it does that pretty well.  However, if the actual title text which can vary is too long, it effectively serves as a limit on how narrow the table can get, which can lead to overlapping with other things on the page.  Im using IE8, BTW.p  pI tried applying codeoverflowhiddencode, codetextoverflowellipsiscode, and codedisplay inlineblockcode to the span and adding a width value for the table cell, all through a stylesheet.  codeDisplayblockcode on the span doubled the height of the row, which I didnt want, so codeinlineblockcode was my choice.  The title text appeared truncated, just as I wanted.  But the table wouldnt get any narrower. p  pAfter messing around changing values and styles through IEDT I concluded that, when figuring out how narrow the table could get, the text was still counted as being its full length.  The span was relatively short, only the text that appeared in the span appeared, but for codetablecellcode width purposes, the text was still all there. p  pI didnt find this phenomenon documented anywhere, but maybe I just dont get around enough.    If codetextoverflowcode cant help me, I guess Ill have to dynamically truncate the title through script, which Id rather not do.  Is there a way to do what I want solely through CSSp  pThanks.  p

Negative 1380 pHow to optimize size of an eps or pdf file generated by Mathematica p  pIt is common that the file size is 50100x bigger that it should be an example below.

Afterwards the attributes are cleared. This is useful for setting a message directly before redirection.p  pIt isnt immediately apparent to me how redirection relates to this request and the next request, since the example of redirection they give is redirecting from one controller action to another, which doesnt respond in two pageshttp responses being sent to the clientp  pHopefully those two questions make sense  i.e. high level difference between page and request scope, and how redirecting between actions is useful for flash scopep

Negative 1380 pI have been implementing basic drag and drop functionality using WPF and C quite successfully for some time now. I have always had one problem after implementing it though... for some reason, the drag and drop functionality stops the codeListBoxItemcodes from becoming selected on the first click.p  pIf I click on a codeListBoxItemcode but dont drag it, it doesnt get selected and the drag icon appears momentarily. On the next click I can then select any of the codeListBoxItemcodes and the drag icon does not appear.

I presumed that by adding codee.Handled  falsecode in the codeListBoxPreviewMouseLeftButtonDowncode handler, the codeListBoxItemcode selection mechanism could handle the click event, but it never reaches that far.p  pI also tried handling the drag initiation in the codeMouseLeftButtonDowncode handler instaed of the codePreviewMouseLeftButtonDowncode handler, but the codeListBoxItemcode selection mechanism handles the click event and it never reached that drag drop handler.p  pThere must be a way to initiate the drag drop operation and still have the codeListBoxItemcode that was clicked on become selected, but I still havent managed to find it... any clues anyone p  pUPDATE p  pThanks to the MSDN article icebat provided a link for, Ive managed to get the drag and drop functionality working perfectly.

When i add the jar file it gives me this message so i assume it was deployed correctly. p  precodeResource HelloWorldEjb.jar created successfully  codepre  pNow when i run the client i get this errorp  precodelog4jWARN See httplogging.apache.orglog4j1.2faq.htmlnoconfig for more info. javax.naming.NameNotFoundException HelloHome not bound     at org.jnp.server.NamingServer.getBindingNamingServer.java771     at org.jnp.server.NamingServer.getBindingNamingServer.java779     at org.jnp.server.NamingServer.getObjectNamingServer.java785     at org.jnp.server.NamingServer.lookupNamingServer.java443     at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0Native Method     at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invokeNativeMethodAccessorImpl.java39     at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invokeDelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java25     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java597     at sun.rmi.server.UnicastServerRef.dispatchUnicastServerRef.java305     at sun.rmi.transport.Transport1.runTransport.java159     at java.security.AccessController.doPrivilegedNative Method     at sun.rmi.transport.Transport.serviceCallTransport.java155     at sun.rmi.transport.tcp.TCPTransport.handleMessagesTCPTransport.java535     at sun.rmi.transport.tcp.TCPTransportConnectionHandler.run0TCPTransport.java790     at sun.rmi.transport.tcp.TCPTransportConnectionHandler.runTCPTransport.java649     at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutorWorker.runTaskThreadPoolExecutor.java885     at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutorWorker.runThreadPoolExecutor.java907     at java.lang.Thread.runThread.java619     at sun.rmi.transport.StreamRemoteCall.exceptionReceivedFromServerStreamRemoteCall.java255     at sun.rmi.transport.StreamRemoteCall.executeCallStreamRemoteCall.java233     at sun.rmi.server.UnicastRef.invokeUnicastRef.java142     at org.jnp.server.NamingServerStub.lookupUnknown Source     at org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContext.lookupNamingContext.java728     at org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContext.lookupNamingContext.java688     at javax.naming.InitialContext.lookupInitialContext.java392     at client.HelloClient.mainHelloClient.java58 Exception in thread main java.lang.NullPointerException     at client.HelloClient.mainHelloClient.java72 codepre  pInitially i thought that i had to configure the JNDI resource for which the client will use to connect to find the EJB on the application server. Is this not necessary The example i am using is using the EJB name in the lookup statement. Here is the section of the client code for making the connection. p  precode    Properties env  new Properties  env.putContext.INITIALCONTEXTFACTORY, org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContextFactory  env.putContext.URLPKGPREFIXES, org.jboss.namingorg.jnp.interfaces env.putContext.PROVIDERURL, jnp127.0.0.11099      env  new InitialContextenv  InitialContext ctx  null  try      ctx  new InitialContextenv  catch NamingException e       TODO Autogenerated catch block     e.printStackTrace          Object obj  null  try      obj  ctx.lookupHelloHome  catch NamingException e       TODO Autogenerated catch block     e.printStackTrace   HelloHome home  HelloHome javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject.narrowobj, HelloHome.class codepre  pAnd here are the contents of the ejbjar.xmlp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltejbjar     xmlnshttpjava.sun.comxmlnsj2ee     xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstalce     xsischemaLocationhttpjava.sun.comxmlnsj2ee     httpjava.sun.comxmlnsj2eeejbjar21.xsd     version2.1gt      ltenterprisebeansgt         ltsessiongt             ltejbnamegtHelloWorldEJBltejbnamegt             lthomegtex1.ejb21.HelloHomelthomegt             ltremotegtex1.ejb21.Helloltremotegt             ltlocalhomegtex1.ejb21.HelloLocalHomeltlocalhomegt             ltlocalgtex1.ejb21.HelloLocalltlocalgt             ltejbclassgtex1.ejb21.HelloBeanltejbclassgt             ltsessiontypegtStatelessltsessiontypegt             lttransactiontypegtContainerlttransactiontypegt         ltsessiongt       ltenterprisebeansgt  ltejbjargt codepre  pOne thing i found interesting is that when i compiled the client class, it refused to compile unless it had a reference to the HelloHome class. To resolve this i had to add the ejb jar file to the classpath of the client class. Is this how it is supposed to work i.e. the ejb jar file needs to be on the classpath of the client p  pIn terms of the jndi name used for the lookup, do i need to create a new name In the above example, it looks the EJB name is used as a lookup. p  h2Edith2  pI am currently going throught a book about EJB 3.0. Part of the introduction to EBJ 3.0 is to introduce me to the 2.0 variant hence why i am trying out this example. I think it does make sense to at least get a small understanding of how they work even if i am not planning on using EJB2. p  pI had a look at the console for the list of deployed applications and i cant see my application on the EJB2.0 menu item. This i think means that the jar file has not deployed correctly. The Jboss logs do show that it was deployed see 4th line below. p  precode163650,982 INFO  [org.rhq.core.pc.PluginContainer] Plugin Container initialized. 163650,987 INFO  [org.jboss.on.embedded.manager.pc.PluginContainerResourceManager] Discovering Resources... 163650,988 INFO  [org.rhq.core.pc.inventory.AutoDiscoveryExecutor] Executing server discovery scan... 163653,920 INFO  [org.rhq.core.pc.inventory.InventoryManager] Detected new Server [Resource[id3, typeJBossAS Server, keyCbinappserversjboss6.1.0.Finalserverdefault, nameJBoss AS 6 default, parentltnullgt, version6.1.0.Final]]  adding to local inventory... 163654,032 INFO  [org.rhq.core.pc.inventory.AutoDiscoveryExecutor] Found 0 servers. 163654,032 INFO  [org.rhq.core.pc.inventory.RuntimeDiscoveryExecutor] Running runtime discovery scan rooted at [platform] 163654,093 INFO  [org.rhq.core.pc.inventory.InventoryManager] Detected new Server [Resource[id4, typeJBoss AS JVM, keyJVM, nameJVM, parentltnullgt, version1.6.007]]  adding to local inventory... 163654,097 INFO  [org.rhq.plugins.jmx.JMXServerComponent] Starting connection to JMX Server JVM 163654,695 INFO  [org.rhq.core.pc.inventory.RuntimeDiscoveryExecutor] Scanned [0] servers and found [0] total descendant Resources. codepre  pIs there anything that looks wrong in the structure i described above      p  h2Edith2  pOk i managed to resolve it with the help from comments from richj.

Negative 1380 pI have a website based on GAE and Python, and Id like the user to be able to upload a text file for processing. My implementation is based on standard code from the docs see a hrefhttpcode.google.comappenginedocspythonblobstoreoverview.html relnofollowhttpcode.google.comappenginedocspythonblobstoreoverview.htmla and my text file upload handler essentially looks like thisp  precodeclass Uploaderblobstorehandlers.BlobstoreUploadHandler     def postself         uploadfiles  self.getuploadsfile         blobinfo  uploadfiles[0]         blobreader  blobstore.BlobReaderblobinfo.key         for line in blobreader             line  line.rstrip.decodecp1252             dosomethingline         blobreader.close codepre  pThis works fine for a text file encoded with Code Page 1252, which is what you get when using Windows Notepad and saving with what it calls an ANSI encoding. But if you use this handler with a file that has been saved with Notepads UTF8 encoding, and contains, say, some Cyrillic characters or a uumlaut, youll end up with gibberish. For such a file, changing decodecp1252 to decodeutf8 will do the trick. Well, theres also the possibility of a byte order mark BOM at the beginning, but thats easily stripped away.p  pBut how do you know which decoding to use The BOM isnt guaranteed to be there, and I dont see any other way to know, other than to ask the userwho probably doesnt know either. Is there a reliable method for determining the encoding I dont necessarily have to use the blobstore if some other means solves it.p  pAnd then theres the encoding that Windows Notepad calls Unicode which is a UTF16 little endian encoding. I could find no decoding including utf16le that correctly decodes a file saved with this encoding. Can one of these files be readp

Negative 1380 pIm playing around a bit with image processing and decided to read up on how color quantization worked and after a bit of reading I found the a hrefhttpwww.leptonica.compapersmediancut.pdf relnofollowModified Median Cut Quantizationa algorithm.p  pIve been reading the code of the a hrefhttptpgit.github.comLeptonicacolorquant28csource.html relnofollowC implementation in Leptonica librarya and came across something I thought was a bit odd.p  pNow I want to stress that I am far from an expert in this area, not am I a mathhead, so I am predicting that this all comes down to me not understanding all of it and not that the implementation of the algorithm is wrong at all.p  pThe algorithm states that the emvboxem should be split along the lagest axis and that it should be split using the following logicp  blockquote   pThe largest axis is divided by locating the bin with the median pixel   by population, selecting the longer side, and dividing in the center   of that side. We could have simply put the bin with the median pixel   in the shorter side, but in the early stages of subdivision, this   tends to put low density clusters that are not considered in the   subdivision in the same vbox as part of a high density cluster that   will outvote it in median vbox color, even with future medianbased   subdivisions. The algorithm used here is particularly important in   early subdivisions, and 3is useful for giving visible but low   population color clusters their own vbox. This has little effect on   the subdivision of high density clusters, which ultimately will have   roughly equal population in their vboxes.p blockquote  pFor the sake of the argument, lets assume that we have a vbox that we are in the process of splitting and that the red axis is the largest. In the Leptonica algorithm, on line 01297, the code appears to do the followingp  ul liIterate over all the possible green and blue variations of the red colorli liFor each iteration it adds to the emtotalem number of pixels population its found along the red axisli liFor each red color it sum up the population of the current red and the previous ones, thus storing an accumulated value, for each red li ul  pemnote when I say red I mean each point along the axis that is covered by the iteration, the actual color may not be red but contains a certain amount of redemp  pSo for the sake of illustration, assume we have 9 bins along the red axis and that they have the following populationsp  blockquote   p4 8 20 16 1 9 12 8 8p blockquote  pAfter the iteration of all red bins, the empartialsumem array will contain the following count for the bins mentioned abovep  blockquote   p4 12 32 48 49 58 70 78 86p blockquote  pAnd emtotalem would have a value of 86p  pOnce thats done its time to perform the actual emmedian cutem and for the red axis this is performed on line 01346p  pIt iterates over bins and check they accumulated sum. And heres the part that throws me of from the description of the algorithm. It looks for the first bin that has a value that is emgreaterem than emtotal2emp  pWouldnt emtotal2em mean that it is looking for a bin that has a value that is greater than the emaverageem value and not the emmedianem  The median for the above bins would be em49emp  pThe use of em43em or em49em could potentially have a huge impact on how the boxes are split, even though the algorithm then proceeds by moving to the center of the larger side of where the matched value was.. p  pAnother thing that puzzles me a bit is that the paper specified that the bin with the median value should be located, but does not mention how to proceed if there are an even number of bins.. the median would be the result of emab2em and its not guaranteed that any of the bins contains that population count. So this is what makes me thing that there are some approximations going on that are negligible because of how the split actually takes part at the center of the larger side of the selected bin.p  pSorry if it got a bit long winded, but I wanted to be as thoroughas I could because its been driving me nuts for a couple of days now p

Negative 1380 pInitially, I had a problem that a click event was firing multiple times, but I have managed to overcome that with a probably over use of codeunbindcode and codeonecode as youll see in my code belowp  pWhat I have here is some code which opens up a universally usable Modal window which I use for various things, including, in some cases a password form.p  pI dont think you need the HTML so I wont post that.p  pWhen a button, or an action causes the window to be required, I call the function like thisp  precodeshowModalAlerttype, theWidth, theHeight, title, html, confirmThis, denyThis codepre  pThe first three variables determine how the window will look, codetitlecode and codehtmlcode determine the content and codeconfirmThiscode and codedenyThiscode are functions set immediately prior to calling this function and determine what the action should be if this is a codeconfirmcode window and the codeconfirmcode or codedenycode buttons are press.p  pIn the case of a codesecuritycode window, the confirm button is replace by a sign it button which submits a simple password form and returns a User Id from database. If a User Id is successfully returned, the script programatically presses the codeconfirmcode button and in turn runs its function as per the call to the inital opening of the modal window.p  pstrongMy problemstrong is that if an incorrect password is entered, or a user cancels the window and then later without refreshing the browser window, reenters the password correctly, the codeconfirmThiscode function is performed twice or as many times as the incorrect passwordcancel action was performed.p  pSo, clearly, what it is doing is remembering the codeconfirmThiscode function each time.p  pAs I said, initially, the password success function was clicking codeconfirmItcode twice, copious use of codeonecode has fixed this, it is now definitely only clicking codeconfirmItcode once, but it is still performing the function multiple time.p  pstrongHow can I clear this function and ensure it is only performed oncestrongp  pThe function from which I am calling the modal window looks like thisp  precode    saveDelivery.clickfunction              function confirmIt                  formData  JSON.stringifydelDetail.serializeObject                 saveDataformData                 saveDelivery.removeClasscentreLoader                          showModalAlertsecurity, 300px, 185px, Security, You need to Sign this action., confirmIt,       codepre  pIts simply a click on the codesaveDeliverycode element, the codeconfirmThiscode function is declared at this point and submits an AJAX formp  pthe actual codeshowModalAlertcode function is belowp  precodefunction showModalAlerttype, theWidth, theHeight, title, html, confirmThis, denyThis           stuff that opens the alert window   if confirmThis        confirmIt.oneclick, function   closeAlert.oneclick.click   else      confirmIt.oneclick, function   confirmThis closeAlert.oneclick.click   if denyThis        denyIt.oneclick, function   closeAlert.oneclick.click signIt.unbind   else      denyIt.oneclick, function   denyThis closeAlert.oneclick.click signIt.unbind       if type  confirm      .closeAlert, .signItForm.hide  if type  alert      .alertConfirm, .signItForm.hide  if type  fixedAlert      .closeAlert, .alertConfirm, .signItForm.hide  if type  security      .signItForm.show     .closeAlert.hide     confirmIt.hide     signIt.unbind.fadeTofast,1    signIt.liveclick, function   var formData  JSON.stringify.secureSign.serializeObject var signitPwd  signItpwd.val var jsonURL  jsonoutgetdata.aspxsqlSELECT id, password FROM users WHERE password   signitPwd   LIMIT 1ampoutputjsonampusedbnewamplabelNameanyampfileName  .getJSONjsonURL, function data      if data.length gt 0          .savingUserID.valdata[0].id         confirmIt.oneclick.click         signIt.fadeTofast, 0         confirmIt.show      else          signIt.fadeTofast, 0         confirmIt.oneclick.show         .closeAlert.show         .alertConfirm, .signItForm.hide         alertTitle.htmlError         alertContent.css textalign center .htmlPassword Denied        codepre

Negative 1380 pSo, my problem is this. I have a legacy MySQL database that Im building a shiny new Django application over. For whatever reason, some fairly daft design decisions were madesuch as all fields, no matter what they contain, being stored as varcharsbut because since other systems that Im not rewriting depend on that same data I cant destructively change that schema at all.p  pI want to treat a certain fieldthe stock quantity on handas an integer, so that in my template I can check its amount and display a relevant value basically, if there are more than 100 items available, I want to just display 100 Available.p  pThe existing value for stock quantity is stored as, oddly, a varchar holding a float as if its possible to have fractional amounts of an item in stockp  precodeitem.qty u72.0 codepre  pNow, I figure as a worst case I can use QuerySet.values, and iterate over the results, replacing each stock quantity with an int parsed version of itself. Something like ...p  precodeitemlist  items.values for item in itemlist     item[qty]  intfloatitem[qty] codepre  p... but wont that cause my QuerySet to evaluate itself completely I confess to being fairly ignorant of the process by which Django handles lazy execution of queries, but it seems like working with actual values would mean evaluating the query before it needs to.p  pSo, am I complaining about nothing I mean, its definitely evaluating these values in the template anyway, or is there a better way to do what I need to dop

Negative 1380 pI have an array y with x no. of elements inside it the number x is given by user, I need to create an array of structures which has elements of exactly the same type as that in array y i.e the array of structures would have x elements.p
Negative 1380 pI have many activities like, loginmaina,b,c,dlogout [a,b,c,d are four activities]. when I login app then it goes to main and finish login activity. and main launches each activity separately.

Negative 1380 pI would like to be able to reference one table from a field in another. For instance, if I have a table with columns 1, 2 amp 3 and rows A, B amp C, the field at 1A would reference a table named 1A, possibly. Table 1A would only need to contain a single column with each row containing a name, and possibly an ID, but I really only need a list. When I query the database I would need to be able to getcompare the referenced tableslists in a given column, 1A, 1B amp 1C.  Am I approaching this correctly Is there a better way to storereference lists in a database. The main table would not change, only the referenced tables would be updated. Im new to databases, thanks for your help.p

Negative 1380 pIf I have a codeCustomercode class that just has simple properties e.g. codeNamecode, etc. then I can create a codeCustomersControllercode that derives from codeApiControllercode, and query my Customer objects using the URL codeapicustomerscode.p  pSimilarly, if I have an codeOrdercode class with simple properties codeDescriptioncode, codeAmountcode then I can create an codeOrdersControllercode and access it in the same way.p  pHowever, if I then add a property to my codeCustomercode class that lists the codeOrdercodes associated with that codeCustomercodep  precodepublic class Customer      public int Id  get set      public string Name  get set       ...     public virtual ICollectionltOrdergt Orders  get set   codepre  p...then when I try to query using codeapicustomerscode I get a 500 Server Error.

Negative 1380 pWhat i want to do is to be able to select multiple files using the multiple attribute on  tag but when starting to upload  POST each files will be uploaded individually  having the possibility to remove a file from the queuethis is what makes things even much harder, because adding files is not a problem since i can easily create another element but removing is impossible.p  pNow for security reasons its impossible to alter a file tag in html so far what i have done is having a single file input and when selecting a file, a new element is created in its place so i am giving the illusion of a queue and then using jquery i upload each file individually  cant select multiple files at once but everything worksp  pI have found some flash plugins but i dont want to depend on more libraries, if it was a simple flash file no problem but most of those plugins need additional js files etc...p  pI would be happy to see a crossbrowser solution.

Negative 1380 pI have a common problem in which I want an ideal scenario in which I can have, for example, many classes which inherit fromp  pIThingImporterp  p...and many classes which inherit fromp  pIThingExporter.p  pPerhaps I may have concrete classes such as XmlThingImporter, and SQLThingExporter, making it possible to import data from an XML file and export it to a SQL database.  I should be able to replace the importer or exporter with any other concrete implementation and have things just work.p  pThe problem is, Ive found that its often more efficient if the importer has knowledge of the exporters implementation.  If the XML importer knows that its writing to a SQL database, it can take certain factors into account, such as the fact that bulk insertions are more efficient.  In other cases, I may be able to avoid having the importer store all the imported data in memory before exporting it and if its a ton of data, that can be a good thing.p  pAre there any known best practices for either creating a generic solution which works regardless, or dealing with the situation in which intimate familiarity is required between the importer and exporterp

Negative 1380 pIm using Java2D for a game Im writing and havent had any issues using it until I started integrating it with other swing components. My problem is when the first component I add to the JFrame is not the canvas Im drawing to, I get a weird artifact that shows up when I mouse over the scroll bar for the textpane. It happens every time I execute the application. When I have the canvas first, theres no problem.p  pFor some reason this appears to only occur on Windows when the default Java2D pipeline is in use which happens to be sun.java2d.d3dtrue, and the artifact occurs. When I set sun.java2d.opengltrue or sun.java2d.noddrawfalse AND sun.java2d.d3dfalse, then it does not occur.p  pIm guessing this is some kind of bug with the Direct3D Java2D pipeline I can easily work around it, but curious to know if anyone else has run into such an issue Im running the latest JDK7u7, but it happens with previous versions as well. I should note that if I minimize the window and restore it, the artifact goes away and never returns until I restart the application.p  pwith artifact img srchttpi.imgur.comvOQls.png altbadp  pwith no artifact after adding the canvas first instead of the JLabel image img srchttpi.imgur.comis7tm.png altgoodp  pIf someone has any further info on this Id appreciate it.

Negative 1380 pIm working with Activiti workflows in Alfresco Share and I need to add a header common to all the user task forms in a workflow. This header would be a set of readonly properties fields displaying context workflow information at the top of all the user task forms in the workflow. For example, in client management workflows, the header may show the client name and surnames, the client file code, etc., displaying each value in a readonly text box or label.p  pIs there a simple way to add a set of information fields and populate them as well to all the user task forms in a workflow I know its possible to create a new aspect containing the desired properties, but how could I add that aspect at runtime to my task types and set their property values via JavaScript when needed Currently, each user task in the workflow has its own custom type i.e. form in a workflow model definition XML file, except for some standard review tasks, which are using wfactivitiReviewTask as form key. The set of readonly information fields should appear in all the forms, including the standard review task forms.p  pI want to achieve something like this see red squarep  pa hrefhttpimageshack.usaimg184524taskform.jpg relnofollowTask form with information fieldsap  pThanks for your help in advance.p  pstrongUPDATE 1strongp  pI have no experience with form templates. Since my forms are very simple, I just used a few model definitions aspects amp types and some Share custom configuration combined to design them. The information I wish to display in the header can be easily retrieved from JavaScript code, since its stored in several workflow context variables. This is what I had in mind, not tested yet, please tell me if its a workable idea.

The problem is that many user tasks in the workflow have a builtin type, not a custom one. It would be nice to be able to add the aspect with all the required values to the task type at runtime by JavaScript code, but this is probably not possible.li liI need a different custom config evaluator for each task type in shareconfigcustom.xml. Same problem.li liI find it quite cumbersome to use and hard to maintain. Moreover, correct me if Im wrong, I cannot see a simple way to set values to the header fields of all the task forms in the workflow. I think I should add a create event listener to every user task, with the following codeli ol  p[JavaScript Code]p  precode    var customerName  execution.getVariablecustomerName     var customerSurname  execution.getVariablecustomerSurname     task.setVariablemynscustomerName, customerName     task.setVariablemynscustomerSurname, customerSurname codepre
Negative 1380 pIm not sure how to go about this, I need to export a mongodb collection as an .csv.

Negative 1380 pI have a problem that I can not really solve. I have created a graphing app which will contain data with alot of data points. To enable scrolling in the graph i create a bitmap of the graph data, and the shift  move the bitmap to the right or left of the screen depending on the user input. The bitmap is always the graph view height and graph view width. When the user moves the bitmap, i shift the bitmap withp  pmemoryCanvas.drawBitmapmemoryBitmap, bitmapShift, 0.0f, paintp  pwhere shift is a a float value containing the shifting values. p  pNow, on most devices i have tried this is, it works very nice. I have tried it on HTC Desire, Galaxy Tab and Galaxy S. When testing this on my own Galaxy S however, i get strange results that i can not explain. Do note that my Galaxy S contains a custom rom with android 4.0.4, so that is probably the reason why i get this behavior, but i still can not understand it or properly mitigate it. p  pSo in a normal use case behavior, the bitmaps get shifted by bitmapShift number of pixels, and then i fill in the empty space by normal line drawing. But when using my phone, dragging the bitmap either direction slowly, so the bitmapShift values are around 0.5, the bitmap does not move, or only moves sometimes. I have compared the bitmapShift on the other platforms and they are in the same range, 0.5 when dragging slowly. This behavior does of course screw up my drawings a lot. This does also happen when doing fast dragging, but its most visible when doing it slowly.p  pI can not really figure out what causes this behavior. The bitmap does not move according to my bitmapShift value. It does on all other platforms i have tried. If i skip using bitmaps, and only draw lines according to the shifting values, everything works fine. p  pDoes anyone have any idea on what could cause this behavior Im kinda running out after sitting some days trying to figure it out. The critical code is below. This code is in my onDraw function.p  precodememoryCanvas.setBitmapemptyBitmap First set another bitmap to clear  memoryCanvas.drawColorColor.TRANSPARENT, PorterDuff.Mode.CLEAR Clear it memoryCanvas.drawBitmapmemoryBitmap, bitmapShift, 0.0f, paint Draw shifted bitmap on it memoryCanvas.drawLineslineDrawPoints, 0 , cnt, paint Draw remaining lines memoryCanvas.setBitmapmemoryBitmap Set the original  memoryCanvas.drawColorColor.TRANSPARENT, PorterDuff.Mode.CLEAR Clear original memoryCanvas.drawBitmapemptyBitmap, 0.0f, 0.0f, paint Draw the final image                  canvas.drawBitmapmemoryBitmap, 0, 0.0f, paint And finally draw on real canvas codepre  pAny help, tips, suggestions are very welcome. p  pCheers Wilhelm p

Negative 1380 pConsider the following Cpseudocodep  precodeclass C      int a,b,c    inline void simplemethod   whatever      void complexmethod  C foo,bar  int main     foo.complexmethod    bar.simplemethod  codepre  pOK. Now the generated assembly code for codebar.simplemethodcode will obviously contain direct references to the variables bar.a, bar.b and so on, i.e. it will bnotb go through an object pointer.p  pThe noninlined method, however, will access everything through an object pointer. But since I am programming an embedded controller which either has limited addressing capabilities or which GCC doesnt understand too well, the resulting assembly code is really slow and bloated.p  pUsing codealwaysinlinecode generates fast and reasonably neat code. But since there are multiple callers to complexmethod, this is not a viable solution.p  pThe best way to solve this problem Ive managed to come up with is to slap an codealwaysinlinecode onto codeXcomplexmethodcode, create a heap of wrappers along the lines ofp  precode void foocomplexmethod  foo.complexmethod  codepre  pand then remember to always use these wrappers.p  pThis is a nobrainer if you have one class, one complex method, and two globals, like in this example. The problem is that our current design has rather more of these  and keeping the argument lists and return values of all of these wrappers straight is a major headache besides, I discover new direct calls to the methods every week. p  pThus, I wonder if theres an easier idiom possibly implemented in interestinglycomplex templates and all that stuff which C is infamous for  with which to accomplish the same thing.p

Negative 1380 pIm trying to manipulate a special struct and I need some sort of a swizzle operator.

If you need a good reason for that, its because the codefloat[2]code are actually resembling a platform specific PowerPC paired singles.

Negative 1380 pI wonder is there any way to slow down the disappearance of a native keyboard in an iOS app when using coderesignFirstRespondercode on a TextView. The keyboard is going down too fast and I want it to go slower. Is that possiblep  pstrongEDITstrong My context is this I add a new view on top of the current view and because of this, my keyboard disappears momentarily.  Thats how my code looksp  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      UIButton tmpButton  [UIButton buttonWithTypeUIButtonTypeRoundedRect]     [tmpButton setTitleTap me forStateUIControlStateNormal]     [tmpButton sizeToFit]     [tmpButton addTargetself actionselectorbtnTestClicked forControlEventsUIControlEventTouchUpInside]      [self.view addSubviewtmpButton]     void btnTestClicked     [tmpText resignFirstResponder]  codepre  pI also have the view hierarchy like thatp  precode BOOLapplicationUIApplication application didFinishLaunchingWithOptionsNSDictionary launchOptions       Override point for customization after application launch.     self.window.windowLevel  UIWindowLevelStatusBar  1     return YES  codepre  pThe app is real simple but the keyboards disappears very fast, not like when I dont have any other views.p
Negative 1380 pI am stuck in a very common problem.p  pI am plugging my jar which has many dependencies on third party vendor into an application server lib directory. If I just copy my jar along with its dependencies into server lib then server classpath becomes to long and hence server is not able to work. Therefore I want to package this Jar with all its dependencies in a single jar so that servers classpath doesnt become too long. I found on various forums that there is a utility to do this i.e. OneJar. But this utility works on executable jar. In my case, my final jar will not be executable. p  pAlso I tried ZIPFileSetGroup utility provided by ANT but that is causing security issues with Manifest file.p  pCan you please help me in resolving this issuep  pThanksp
Negative 1380 pIm building an online game, and using node and whatnot, anyway im not too keen on constant streams and streams of data just for animations, ive set up a way for it to animate client side and so on... but i found a problem, all i was doing was setting the new coordinates and telling all the clients to animate their character to that point, but if you refreshed the page, the player would be there instantly.p  pI have got a distance,speed of movement,time of movement,start and destination... i know where they started moving, i know where their destination is, i know when they started moving and at what speed, and in a linear fashion.p  pWhat i need to work out, is where the player is whilst animating at that specific time when other players join the game.p

Id prefer to avoid scripting languages.p  pAre they ok Which one is best suited Also is this middle dude going to have to be on the same server that has the database or can be another machine on the internetid prefer this, so i can put it on my own VPS and not have to screw up with the server machinep

Negative 1380 pIm developing an applet that behaves strangely this is not the usual I cant start my applet in the browser problem, but something more subtle. p  pThe applet consists into a jtabbedpane with 8 tabs, each of which does some data manipulation in the workflow, and the user has two buttons back and forward to cycle through tabs.p  pWhen I run it into the browser latest chrome or firefox, but this doesnt matter I notice a consistent slowdown when passing from the 7th to the 8th tab in the latter I put a jtable with a custom tablemodel in that tab and in eclipse it runs just fine. A few debug steps later I notice that the jvm throws a classnotfoundexception for the class RateTableModel, which is my custom tablemodel. The odd thing is that even though I test the applet both in the IDE and as a self signed applet into the browser that exception is never thrown in any console. I verified everywhere there are no empty catch blocks, every exception gets always its stackstrace printed and if I put the initialization code of my tablemodel in a trycatch block that exception never gets caught. The even funnier thing is that after a random amount of time the execution continues as if nothing happened only in the IDE this time, whereas in the browser the GUI acts just like a normal exception it messes everything up.p  pWhat I would like to ask is for any idea on why this happens.p  pThe class RateTableModel is located in the package geotel.utils, where I have other classes I regularly instantiate before I have to load this one, and I verified that this class is present in the jar.p  pDetails on the development maybe for those who read this can be usefulp  pThe applet is signed using the commandp  precodejarsigner keystore keystore3 CGestioneOneri.jar me3 codepre  pthe applet is run from the following html filep  precodelthtmlgt     ltheadgt         ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetISO88591gt             lttitlegtTitololttitlegt     ltheadgt     ltbodygt         ltscript srchttpwww.java.comjsdeployJava.jsgtltscriptgt         ltscriptgt              var attributes  codegeotel.gui.Login.class,                      archiveGestioneOneri.jar,mysqlconnectorjava5.1.20bin.jar,poi3.920121203.jar,forms1.3.0.jar,                      width1024, height700              var parameters  jnlphrefgestioneoneri.jnlp, portalUrlhttp192.168.146.1458080GestioneOneriServlet, nomeUtente, numeroPratica, percorsoFileCalcoloOneri, nomeFileCalcoloOnericalcoloOneri.xls               var version  1.6              deployJava.runAppletattributes, parameters, version           ltscriptgt         ltnoscriptgtThis page requires JavaScript.ltnoscriptgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pThe JNLP file is the followingp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt     ltjnlp hrefgestioneoneri.jnlpgt         ltinformationgt             lttitlegtGestione Oneri Urbanisticilttitlegt             ltvendorgtGeotel soc. coop.ltvendorgt             ltofflineallowed gt         ltinformationgt         ltresourcesgt             ltj2se version 1.6 initialheapsize128m maxheapsize1024m   hrefhttpjava.sun.comproductsautodlj2se gt             ltjar hrefGestioneOneri.jar maintrue gt         ltjar hrefmysqlconnectorjava5.1.20bin.jargt         ltjar hrefpoi3.920121203.jargt         ltjar hrefforms1.3.0.jargt         ltresourcesgt         ltappletdesc             nameGestione Oneri Urbanistici             mainclassgeotel.gui.Login             width1024             height700gt     ltjnlpgt codepre  pThe code that causes the ClassNotFoundException is the following class DatiRatePanelp  precodethis.tm  new geotel.utils.RateTableModelcolumnNames, oneriPratica, rate, rateizzazioniPreviste codepre  pand the definition of the class RateTableModel isp  precodepublic class RateTableModel extends AbstractTableModel codepre  pEDIT after a few more debug steps, I found that in the debug view there is the situation in the screenshot img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBul3I.png altDebugp  pI absolutely have no idea what those keys stand for, but if I keep pressing F5 Step into those keys go away, the very following step the execution continues and the classloader magically becomes able to find the class RateTableModel.

Negative 1380 pI am working on an application where I have a codeUINavigationControllercode embedded inside a codeUITabBarControllercode. The codeUINavigationControllercode has a codeUITableViewcode that transitions to a emDetailControllerem when a cell is tapped.p  pMy question is I select a cell on strong[TAB1]strong and transition to the emDetailControllerem. If I select strong[TAB2]strong and then go back to strong[TAB1]strong its still on the detail controller. Is there anyway when strong[TAB2]strong is selected that I can unwinddismiss the emDetailControllerem on strong[TAB1]strong i.e. so its showing the table view cells again. p  pMy other line of thinking is that doing this would not leave the UI in the state the user left it in, i.e. after viewing the emDetailControllerem and pressing strong[TAB2]strong returning to strong[TAB1]strong would present the user with the cells in the codeUITableViewcode. It feels better for the application to revert the emDetailControllerem if you leave the strongTABstrong, which is why I am asking...p  pNB codeI present the DetailController via a push segue from thecodeUITableViewCellcode.codep

On C side, when I am calling the stored proc, I am declaring the param asp  precodevar paramSize  command.Parameters.AddParameterSize, this.Size paramSize .SqlDbType  SqlDbType.Decimal paramSize .Size  16 paramSize .Precision  6 codepre  pI am getting the connection string asp  precodeusing var connection  new SqlConnection                 context.Connection as EntityConnection.StoreConnection.ConnectionString                       Call function to execute the stored proc.          codepre  pThen I open the connection, and do the usual codecommand.ExecuteNonQuerycode Now Size is passed in as 75000.000000, which should be fine, as the field is numeric16,6. In fact, I already have records in the same table, which have values like 75000.000000 in that Size column. However, when I call codecommand.ExecuteNonQuerycode, it comes back with p  blockquote   pParameter value 75000.000000 is out of range.p blockquote  pSo, instead of passing in the parameter, I decided to default Size in the stored proc to 75000.000000.

Negative 1380 pI have a fairly highlevel question about Python and running interactive simulations. Here is the setupp  pI am porting to Python some simulation software I originally wrote in Smalltalk VW. It is a kind of Recurrent Neural Network controlled interactively from a graphical interface. The interface allows the manipulation of most the networks parameters in real time, in addition to controlling the simulation itself starting it, stopping it, etc. In the original Smalltalk implementation, I had two processes running with different priority levels p  ol liThe interface itself with a higher priorityli liThe neural network running forever at a lower priorityli ol  pCommunication between the two processes was trivial, because all Smalltalk processes share the same address space the Object memory.p  pI am now starting to realize that replicating a similar setup in Python is not so trivial. The threading module does not allow its threads to share address space, as far as I can tell. The multiprocessing module does, but in a rather complex way with Queues, etc.p  pSo I am starting to think that my Smalltalk perspective is leading me astray and I am approaching a relatively simple problem from the wrong angle altogether. Problem is, I dont know what is the right angle How would you recommend I approach the problem I am fairly new to Python obviously and more than willing to learn. But I would greatly appreciate suggestions on how to frame the issues and which multiprocessing modules if any I should delve into.p  pThanks,p  pStefano       p

Negative 1380 pi m implementing failover for asterisk server , so i have two server active and passive initially asterisk service is running on active but if active fails the passive server should start the service .This is working perfectly as i have checked using xlite softphone. but as i want to generate bulk calls i m using sipp tool , but it generates calls directly tht means if my asterisk server is off thn aslo it generates and tht too with any extensions , so i want to integrate sipp with asterisk server i.e sipp should generate calls if only asterisk server is ruuning.

Negative 1380 pI want to create a a game application, for that i want the client to send to server scores and other information that should be encrypted. p  pI understood that there is a way with codemcryptcode to encrypt data with public and private keys. so the application on the client side will encrypt but I am the only one that will be able to decrypt it. I dont have much more information to go on, i just want to know the most secure way to paste data. p  pWhat I understood so far is this examplep  pif I have codeusernamefooampscore50ampmsghellocodebr I can encrypt it to codemsgencryptedfgus9g8uywe978ygt7923y5235sdfdsadfsdcode examplep  pand only with a specific key that I have on my server I can decrypt it.p  pAgain Im just trying to find the best method to hide data from the user so he wont be able to decrypt it.p  pwhich means that if I encrypted a message... that message wont be able to be sent twice.p  pSo if the user used firebug to see what a request was sent and tries to send it again, the message will be invalid. I guess I can just record it in a database. But if there is a method for such a thing it would be great.p  pI am using PHP 5.4.p

Is it a good idea that the service use the Model directly or have a layer like the ViewModel. Where would validation go in this caseli liAnother conceptual question that I would like more information on is  The attribute driven validation is implemented by virtue of the MVC framework, i.e. it is the MVC architecture that takes the view model, finds the validation attribute on the view model properties and injects relevant validation.

Negative 1380 pI am trying to copy the entire codecontentstorecode folder on a bucket to a timestamped version. Basically codecontenstorecode would be copied to codecontentstore20130729code.p  pMy entire script uses codes3s3mirrorcode first to clone my production S3 bucket to a backup. I then want to rename the backup to a timestamped copy so that I can keep multiple versions of the same. p  pI have a working version of this using codes3cmdcode but it seems to take an abnormally long time. The codes3s3mirrorcode part between the two buckets is done within minutes, possibly because it is a refresh on existing folder. But even in the case of a clean codes3s3mirrorcode no existing contentstore on backup it take around 20 minutes.p  pOn the other hand copying the conentstore to a timestamped copy on the backup bucket takes over an hour and 10 minutes.p  pAm I doing something incorrectly Should the copy of data on the same bucket take longer than a full clone between two different bucketsp  pAny ideas would be appreciated.p  pP.S The command I am running is codes3cmd recursive cp backupBucketcontentStore backupBucket20130729codep
Negative 1380 pI have recently made a bike trip analyzer where you enter your distance travelled and average speed from that trip, and it calculates your time, ranks your current speed with your minimum speed, maximum speed and average speed of all the speeds you have entered to date, and then charts your progress last 10 trips by speed, distance, and time. Things have been going according to plan, except for when I had to delete records incorrect ones at that, and ran the program as normal the numbering was all screwed up due to what the database was doing with the index. I added a function to help alleviate some of that, but it didnt entirely take care of the problem. It wouldnt display exactly 10 records because some record numbers were missing on the intervals specified.

What I am stumped on is the calculation of the algorithmic complexity of each approach. The critical section of both ways is exactly the same a while loop that executes exactly 10m times with m being the calculated number of missing records in the interval being examined. Here, we can definitely say that m is bounded above by 10. What I came up with for both methods is a complexity that is linear with respect to k and summj, j between 1 and k, namely 32k23 sum mj, j between 1 and k1 for the recursive way and 431k3 sum mj, j between 1 and k1. Here, mj reads m sub j. Would the complexity of both algorithms be amortized or would it be Omaxk, summj, j between 1 and k1 p

I now want to create a vector of length n12 that contains the value of codezcode that corresponds to the factor level codefcode. Note my real factor values are not ordered like in the above example, so just repeating the vector codezcode wont work,p  pNow, an obvious solution would be to create a vector codefcodeoutside the data frame, merge it with codezcode and then to use codemergecode. For instance,p  precode newdf lt data.framezz, fc1,2,3  df lt mergedf, newdf, byf codepre  pHowever, I need to repeat this procedure several thousand times, and this codemergecodesolution seems like shooting with canons on microbes. Hence my question there almost surely is an easier and more efficient way to do this, but I just dont know how.

Alternatively if anyone has any ideas about how the length of a label can be compared to the changing available spacep

Negative 1380 pI know this is a problem others must have solved in the past, but in my limited knowledge, have yet to get over the hump. I have data which is ordered by datetime, which needs to be grouped by a combination of two fields status and queue. In instances where the status and queue are the same within a given time frame, they should be considered part of the same group, and thus have the same id.p  pTo accomplish this, Ive attempted to implement DENSERANK, and for all intents and purposes, it has been successful  with exception of the ordering of the groups.

Negative 1380 pstrongNote Just to clarify, this question is not about setting up IoC in MVC controllers but outside them.strongp  pI have IoC working fine in my controllers however I need to have it working outside the controller in custom classes as well in a CacheManager class which uses a list of CacheBuilders to build the cache. p  pFor that until now I was passing a reference of the Windsor container to the  CacheManager and the CacheManager would pass it down to each CacheBuilder to resolve any references it might need to resolve. However Ive believe that isnt a good idea and I want to do that without passing in this reference and from what I read, I think typed factories can help me with that.p  pI created an interface like below... p  precodepublic interface ITypeFactory      T CreateltTgt     void Releaseobject value  codepre  p... and registered it as a type for a factory in the BootStrapContainer method which gets fired when the web app starts....p  precode container.AddFacilityltTypedFactoryFacilitygt  container.RegisterComponent.ForltITypeFactorygt.AsFactory codepre  pNow I intend to use this as the following in one of my CacheBuilders...p  precodepublic class CountryCacheBuilder  ICacheBuilder      public ITypeFactory TypeFactory  get set       public void PersistToCacheCache cache              var repository  TypeFactory.CreateltICountryRepositorygt          var listOfCountries  repository.GetAllCountries           add list of Countries to cache       codepre  p... given ICountryRepository is defined as below....p  precodepublic interface ICountryRepository      ListltCountrygt GetAllCountries  codepre  p... and in Global.asax AppStart method I register all CacheBuilders with the CacheManager like so ...p  precodeCacheManager.Instance.CacheBuilders.Addnew CountryCacheBuilder codepre  pand then call p  precodeCacheManager.BuildCache codepre  pwhich just iterates over the list of CacheBuilders and fires PersistToCache for each of them.p  pHowever in CountryCacheBuilder.PersistToCache method I see that the the TypeFactory property is null when I was expecting it to be instantiated. Can someone tell me what am I missing here  Do I need to tell the container how create each and every CacheBuilder  p

Negative 1380 piPhone plays the html5 video fullscreen and obviously in its own player which has nothing to do with the browser DOM. Inconvenient, awkward, reminds a bit of IE in old times, but ok. The question is about something else  the problem is that after it is done playing it doesnt go away and stays there fullscreen and stopped at last frame, is there a way to make it go away automatically, so that the DOM logic could proceed somehowp

For example, with code[[1,2], [0,1], [1,2,3], [0,1,2], [1,2,3,4]]code as input, the function should return code[[[1,2],[0,1]], [[1,2,3],[0,1,2]], [[1,2,3,4]]]code.

Negative 1380 pPlease understand that Im still learning the concepts of C11s move and rvalue semantics. My question is whether legacy code can get a free lunch of avoiding unnecessary copy by simply using C11 compilers and STL.p  pHere is a very simple example. This code builds a simple character frequency table for a given string. For example, apple should return codea, 1, e, 1, l, 1, p, 2code. As you will see, Im just using vectors as values.p  precodetypedef stdtupleltchar, intgt Frequency typedef stdvectorltFrequencygt Frequencies  Frequencies buildFrequenciesTablestdstring w    char table[z  a  1]   0,    stdforeachw.cbegin, w.cend, [amptable]char c      table[tolowerc  a]       Frequencies freqs   for sizet i  0 i lt z  a  1 i      if table[i]  0       freqs.pushbacktupleltchar, intgtchar a  i, table[i]      return freqs  Q1 Is vector get copied   int main    using namespace std    Frequencies f1  buildFrequenciesTableapple  Q2 Copy   Frequencies f2  buildFrequenciesTablebanana   vectorltFrequenciesgt fs   f1, f2   Q3 Copy  codepre  pIt is clear that C03 generates all copy code using copy constructors and assignment operators when returning vectors as value. What about in C11 codestdvectorcode a has move constructor. Can this code get avoid any unnessarry copies Or, should I use either codeampampcode or codestdforwardcode in the above codep  pI tried to debug the internal STL code, but it was hard to convince.p  pNote My goal is to minimize any unnecessary copies in these functions. I know I could use newpointersreferences, but this will need to resolve memory leak problem. So, Id like to use values as much as possible.p

Negative 1380 pfirst time posting here so go easy on me p  pIve poked through a lot of whats here and I see a lot of indirect answers but nothing thats really pointed me in the right direction or helped I should say.  p  pHeres the situation, we have this java app from a now defunct company.  One of our guys managed to get the source code, but has been unavailable so Ive had to resort to other measures to try and get the changes I need.  I used jdgui to find the class file I need to modify as well as the lines theres seriously only like 3 lines that I need to modify....  jdgui will save the class file as a .java file, and Im fairly certain that if I could get the .java file back into a class file, Id just need to use winrar to drop it back in.  As Ive read here and there, getting a class file out of it isnt that simple.  p  pIve tried using eclipse to create a new project, I tried javac which complained about some line of code that has nothing to do with anything and my guess is its really telling me that theres a function that it cant deal with because its defined in another class file, blah blah blah...  p  pWhy is this complicated  The compiled java file class has references to the other class files it needs, I dont want the compiler to run the program, just put it back together and assume I got my paths right.  Im not a programmer by nature and have been force feeding myself javascript yes yes, not the same thing, but I seriously need to make a few minor changes and then never touch it again.  p  pSo, my question is, whats the simple solution aside from waiting for the source code  which could be sometime between now and the eventual heat death of the universe...p

Negative 1380 pI have several websites and these website share several components. It was quite easy with classic ASP.NET WebControls ascx. I created several such controls, put into one dll library and I reference these libraries from these websites via namespace.elements runatserver...p  pBut I dont know how to do it after I have upgraded to ASP.NET MVC. I can put model and cotroller class into dll. p  pBut how should I put and reuse Views into dllp  pI suppose that Views are not compiled into dll, if I can change the View without recompiling the dll.p  pEDITS I would prefer some standard solution over third party. The last solution for me is to use StringBuilder instead of ViewEngine. p

But starting with 7u25 we had a lot of trouble with this, and our application even refused to work with 7u45.p  pThis is the reason I am thinking about another deployment strategy, which is also used by google chrome If you are going to a hrefhttpchrome.google.com relnofollowhttpchrome.google.coma, you are not asked to download a zip or even exe file and then leave the browser to manually install chrome. Instead on Windows the installer is directly launched. This installer is even intelligent enough to recognize if chrome is already installed and does not request admin rights again and just starts the browser.p  pI plan on implementing a similar installer with Java. The installer would still be launched using Webstart, but would only install a small Eclipse core, which than would automatically install the rest using the Eclipse update mechanism. Because of this the webstart launcher might not change at all for some time, reducing a lot of the trouble we have with webstart.p  pBut is the Eclipse update mechanism capable of reliably updating an Eclipse RCP application even if we for example change the base from juno to kepler Or will we need to uninstall the client on major version changes, leading to an even worse situation compared to webstartp

Negative 1380 pI have a section called as reports and under this there are around 4050 reports. p  pFor each report i need to define a separate classcontroller. p  pI have created a reports folder under controllers and added a ReportsController class under it.

Negative 1380 pI have implemented the usual usernamepassword login process with Shiro for my single page webapp which will submit the username and password over https in production. I use a REST back end rather than a typical MVC framework of any sort to facilitate my SPA. Typically with a REST API a BasicAuth is used to log in, and in response if successful an encrypted token is returned either as a cookie or a response header. Subsequent calls would return the cookie or header to avoid having to resend username and password. Usually the token is an ecnrypted username possibly with some other info that can be derived on the server side either as a session token or something else.p  pAnyway, as I said I am using Shiro and I understand Shiro can use multiple realms for authentication and authorization. What I am trying to do for my web site is require the initial usernamepassword login, then after a user is logged in, somehow avoid the Shiro UsernamePassword authentication process and instead use the token check process. p  pI think the right way is to provide my own custom authentication realm and credentials matcher.. and I have a public domain SHA256 salted password bit of code that stores the salt, iterations and password in one string that Id like to use. What I am not sure of is how to configure the shiro.ini... do I need to provide two custom classes, one for my own usernamepassword for initial login, then another for my token authentication Or can I utilize the builtin shiro usernamePassword, and will its rememberMe feature be good enough in jquery .ajax calls Perhaps I can use the Shiro implementation but also need to attach the shiro rememberMe cookie to all my .ajax calls p  pJust a little confused really on the best approach to provide good usernamepassword initial login and subsequent calls without needing to resent usernamepassword... and to support session invalidation and logout functionality.p  pAnother thought is to not use Shiro, instead use my own servlet filter to check for the initial login, if authenticated, return the response header or cookie myself with my own encrypted token that I keep in HttpSession or in a database back end for the duration of the session, and make sure in my jquery ajax that after each response to look for the token, and resend it in the subsequent requests.p  pThanksp

I annotated the picture to show how I hooked things up. I created a segue between the controller 1 and 2, by connecting its disclosure indicator to the navigation controller containing 2.

I invoke that segue programmatically using p  precode[self performSegueWithIdentifierOpenValvesSelector senderself] codepre  pFor both controllers 2 and 3, I connected both cancel and save navigation items with the exit item of the containing controller.p  pThe problem is that when I have 3 opened, and select either the codeCancelcode of codeSavecode item, it closes not only that view, but 2 as well, returning me to controller 1. I dont want that. Im trying to use 3 to edit some content from 2. How do I get it to just returned to 2, instead of 1p  pOn a broader note, Im not entirely convinced Ive done the right thing by having codeUINavigationControllercodes there.

Negative 1380 pI have a situation where I need rapid and very frequent updates from a websites API. Ive asked them about how fast I can hammer them and theyve said as fast as you like.p  pSo my design architecture is to create several small fast running PHP scripts that do a very specific action, save the result to memcache, and repeat. So the first script grabs a single piece of data via their API and stores it in memcache and then asks again. A second script processes the data the first script stored in memcache and requests another piece of data from the API based on the results of that processing. The third uses the result from the second, does something with that data, asks for more data via the API, on up the chain until a decision is made to execute via their API.p  pI am running these scripts in parallel on a machine with 24 GB RAM and 8 cores. I am also using supervisor in order to manage them.p  pWhen I run every PHP script manually via CLI or browser they work fine. They dont die except where Ive told them to for the browser so I can get some feedback. The logic is fine, the scripts runs fine, etc, etc.p  pHowever, when I leave them running infinitely vai supervisor the logs fill up with Maximum execution time reached errors and the line it points to is line in one of my classes that gets the data from memcache. Sometimes it bombs on a check to see if the data is JSON which it should always be, sometimes it bombs elsewhere in the same functionmethod. The timeout is set for the supervisor managed script is 5 sec because the data is stale by then.p  pI have considered upping the execution time butp  ul lithe data will be stale by then, li limemcache typically returns in less than 1 msec so 5 sec is an eternity,li linone of the scripts have ever failed due to timeout when manually CLI or browser runli ul  pEnvironment Ubuntu 12.04 Server PHP 5.3.101unbuntu3.9 with SuhosinPatch Memcached 1.4.13 Supervisor p  pMemcache Stats from phpMemcachdAdminp  precodeSize 1 GB Uptime 17 hrs, 38 min Hit Rate 76.5 Used 18.9 MB Wasted 18.9 MB Bytes Written 307.8 GB Bytes Read 7.2 GB codepre  pHeres a screenshot img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUjeHI.jpg altphpMemcachedAdmin Screen Capturep  p Additional ThoughtsQuestions p  pI dont think it was clear in my original post that in order to get rapid updates I am running multiple copies in parallel of the scripts that grab API data. So if one script is grabbing basic account data looking for a change to trigger another event, then I actually have at least 2 instances running concurrently. This is because my biggest risk factor is stale data causing a delayed decision combined with a 1 sec response time from the API.p  pSo it occurred to me that the issue may stem from write conflicts where 2 instances of the same script are attempting to write to the same cache key. My initial Googling didnt lead to any good material on possible write conflictscollisions in memcache. However, a little deeper dive provided a page where a user with 2 bookmarking sites powered by Elgg off of 1 memcache instance ran into what he described as collisions.p  pMy initial assumption when deciding to kick multiple instances off in parallel was that Supervisor would kick them off in a sequential and therefore slightly staggered manner maybe a bad assumption, Im new to using Supervisor. Additionally, the API would respond at different rates to each call. Thus with a write time in the submillisecond time frame and an update from each once every 12 seconds the chances of write conflictscollisions seemed pretty low.p  pIm considering using some form of prefixpostfix with the keys. Each instance already has its own instance ID created from an md5 hash. So I could prefix or postfix and then have each instance write to its own key. But then I need another key that holds all of those prefixedpostfixed keys. So now Im doing multiple cache fetches, a loop through all the stored data, and a discard of all but one of those results. I bet theres a betterfaster architecture out there...p  pI am adding the code to do the timing Aziz asked for now. It will take some time to add the code and gather the data.p  pRecommendations welcomep

Initial password means the flag pwdLastSet is set to require password change by next logon. p  pThis is, how it works now.p  precodeprop.putContext.INITIALCONTEXTFACTORY,com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory prop.putContext.PROVIDERURL, ldapsmy.active.directory.com636 prop.putContext.SECURITYAUTHENTICATION, simple prop.putContext.SECURITYPROTOCOL,ADSecurityProtocol prop.putContext.SECURITYPRINCIPAL,this.userid prop.putContext.SECURITYCREDENTIALS,password ldapContext  new InitialLdapContextprop, null   lt...snip...gt  ModificationItem[] mods  new ModificationItem[2] String oldQuotedPassword    oldPassword   byte[] oldUnicodePassword  oldQuotedPassword.getBytesUTF16LE String newQuotedPassword    newPassword1   byte[] newUnicodePassword  newQuotedPassword.getBytesUTF16LE  mods[0]  new ModificationItemDirContext.REMOVEATTRIBUTE, new BasicAttributeunicodePwd, oldUnicodePassword mods[1]  new ModificationItemDirContext.ADDATTRIBUTE, new BasicAttributeunicodePwd, newUnicodePassword ldapContext.modifyAttributesuserDN, mods codepre  pIm looking for an idea how to enable users to change their password especially when they are required to do so.

Negative 1380 pSo the belongsToMany relationship is a manytomany relationship so a pivot table is requiredp  pExample we have a codeuserscode table and a coderolescode table and a codeuserrolescode pivot table.p  pThe pivot table has two columns, codeuseridcode, codefooidcode... codefooidcode referring to the codeidcode in roles table.p  pSo to do this we write the following in the codeusercode eloquent model p  pcodereturn thisgtbelongsToManyRole, userroles, userid, fooidcodep  pNow this looks for an codeidcode field in codeuserscode table and joins it with the codeuseridcode field in the codeuserrolescode table.p  pIssue is I want to specify a different field, other than codeidcode to join on in the codeuserscode table. For example I have codebaridcode in the users table that I want to use as the codelocal keycode to join with codeuseridcodep  pFrom laravels documentation, it is not clear on how to do this. In other relationships like codehasManycode and codebelongsTocode we can specify codelocal keycode and codeforiegn keycode but not in here for some reason.p  pI want the codelocal keycode on the users table to be codebaridcode instead of just codeidcode.p  pHow can I do thisp
Negative 1380 pI am using a Digital Rapids encoder to stream RTMP. I would like to install a flash server in the same VLAN to read the stream. I therefore downloaded Adobe Media Server and wish to stream towards the integrated Adobe Sample Video Player. However, the Digital Rapids doesnt recognize my destination Server URL. I guess it is because of a port issue.p  pChecking the ports situation on my AMS Server cmd  netstat an, I realise port 1935 which receives RTMP is only listening locally 127.0.0.11935 instead of to the exterior I would like to have 0.0.0.01935.

Negative 1380 pI have rather big dataset, possibly millions of objects and I need to trigger the codechildaddedcode event and get the last added child. However whenever I start the service it triggers the event once for each initial child in the dataset.p  pHow Can I avoid this behaviorp  peditp  pThe suggested solution does not solve the problem  it is just ignoring it in my opinion.  In my specific case I store the unique reference to other object as a codenamecode and its codevaluecode is other important data. The Priority on the record is set to the specific number in my case time stamp. I use this to retrieve the record to build a timeline so I need the option to save a new object with custom timestamp  not only current. Listener code.oncode on event codechildaddedcode fits the need perfectly except fetching all the children upon the start. This in my opinion renders this feature absolutely pointless on any large collection. p

Negative 1380 pI am trying to use FramaC to verify safety properties of C code that includes dynamic memory allocation. The current version of the ACSL specification language 1.8 seems to be able to express a lot about dynamically allocated memory. However, most of that stuff is not yet implemented in FramaC Neon.p  pSuppose we take the following snippet of codep  precodeinclude ltstdlib.hgt   requires validp ampamp validq ampamp separatedp, q    ensures validq    void testchar p, char q    freep   int mainvoid    char p  char  malloc10   char q  char  malloc10    testp, q    return 0  codepre  pSo, main allocates two blocks of memory, and passes pointers to them to function test. Test frees the block pointed to by p, but not the block pointed to by q. Suppose I want to prove that at the end of test, pointer q is still valid. How would I proceedp  pIt seems that I have to model the heap on my own axiomatize a few predicates that talk about the heap, and use them to specify malloc and free, mimicking the nonimplemented parts of ACSL.

Negative 1380 pI am developing a gallery for huge pictures, sounds and videositems. The page show really a lot of galleries, and each gallery contains a lot of items. All items will be pulled via ajax in that ,moment the user is asking for. By clicking next for example. At the moment I am caching all viewed items  during lifetime of the page in an extra divcontainer, so that no item needs to be requested via ajax a second time. But thats just a small speed advantage, even noticeable. p  pI would love to do two things  The user is viewing the first gallery. All items he has viewd will be cached. During the time he is not doing anything, maybe watching a video of the page or the actual image, I want my script to load all other items of the page, one after the other, and move them to the cache. but as soon as the user clicks to view the next item, this caching process needs to be paused. So it has the priority 2. If the prosesses the user was asking for are finished, my caching process shall go forward. How can I afford this p  pAnd how can I say, caching should stop when maybe 25MB of cached Items are received How can I see the used RAM of an div containing the items p  pHopefully I could explain what I want and somebody has good understandable ideas for me. p  pBest  Falkp

Negative 1380 pRecently I was trying to fix a pretty difficult constcorrectness compiler error.  It initially manifested as a multiparagraph template vomit error deep within Boost.Python.p  pBut thats irrelevant it all boiled down to the following fact the C11 codestdbegincode and codestdendcode iterator functions are not overloaded to take Rvalues.p  pThe definitions of codestdbegincode arep  precodetemplatelt class C gt auto begin Camp c  gt decltypec.begin  templatelt class C gt auto begin const Camp c  gt decltypec.begin codepre  pSo since there is no RvalueUniversal Reference overload, if you pass it an Rvalue you get a const iterator.p  pSo why do I care  Well, if you ever have some kind of range container type, i.e. like a view, proxy or a slice or some container type that presents a sub iterator range of another container, it is often very convenient to use Rvalue semantics and get nonconst iterators from temporary slicerange objects.  But with codestdbegincode, youre out of luck because codestdbegincode will always return a constiterator for Rvalues.  This is an old problem which C03 programmers were often frustrated with back in the day before C11 gave us Rvalues  i.e. the problem of temporaries always binding as codeconstcode.p  pSo, why isnt codestdbegincode defined asp  precodetemplate ltclass Cgt auto beginCampamp c gt decltypec.begin codepre  pThis way, if codeccode is constant we get a codeCconstiteratorcode and a codeCiteratorcode otherwise. p  pAt first, I thought the reason was for safety.  If you passed a temporary to codestdbegincode, like sop  precodeauto it  stdbeginstdstringtemporary string  never do this codepre  p...youd get an invalid iterator.  But then I realized this problem still exists with the current implementation.  The above code would simply return an invalid emconstemiterator, which would probably segfault when dereferenced.p  pSo, why is codestdbegincode emnotem defined to take an Rvalue or more accurately, a a hrefhttpisocpp.orgblog201211universalreferencesinc11scottmeyers relnofollowstrongUniversal Referencestronga  Why have two overloads one for codeconstcode and one for codenonconstcodep

After the installation I can choose my class emTMyDotNetControlem from ToolBox of the Designer and I can drag and drop it to the WinForm. Because this is a compiled class from the DLL file, the component is displayed in designer just like it would be displayed at runtime in case we dont call procedures or set properties.  p  pAnd that is when things get confusing. I can drag and resize this only once. Clicking the compiled component again triggers a MouseEvent on the component itself. That means, if a mouseEvent handler is implemented in .NET, that handler method is called and performed even in the designer. What I want to do therefore is catching the IDEs click message and make that method focussing the component to edit in Object inspector at Design time. the object inspector shows the published properties of emTMyDotNetControlemp

Negative 1380 pstrongQ1.strong In the below code i get the error Name clash The method equalsT of type Node has the same erasure as equalsObject of type Object but does not override itp  precodepublic class NodeltTgt      public boolean equalsT b          return false             public boolean equalsObject b        return false           codepre  pI tried to read explanations online but still have a simple question. If after type erasure, the equivalent of public boolean equalsT b is public boolean equalsObject b which is perfectly valid way to override, then why the fussp  pstrongQ2.strong Lets say i add the Override annotation to public boolean equals. The error thrown this time is The method equalsT of type Node must override a superclass method. Again, the same argument above, since after type erasure public boolean equalsT b is public boolean equalsObject b why does the compiler complainp  pOne possible explanation i can think of is Before type erasure the compiler tries to find a method with the signature public boolean equalsT b in the base class, doesnt find it, and complains.p  pstrongQ3.strong In the below code we get the error Cannot perform instanceof check against type parameter T.p  precodeif  b instanceof T             codepre  pAgain, i get the explaination that T would be stripped out and become Object and we have no info of T at runtime. Lets say hypothetically is the compiler allowed it, wouldnt this be a valid check i.e. if  b instanceof Object p  pSo, is the compiler complaining mainly because this is misleading as this will always be true and wants you to change it Or is there some other reasons too why this isnt a good idea.p

Negative 1380 pIm developing Windows Phone 8.1 WinRT application Universal App, which is based on codeMapControlcode control.p  pThe problem with it is that, for unknown reasons to me, when I call codeMapControl.SetLocationcode method, I get codeAccessViolationExceptioncode. It does not always happen  in fact Ive been using that method for quite a long time and everything was fine. But now Im developing new functionality  it boils down to porting code from MSDN pushpin clustering  a hrefhttpscode.msdn.microsoft.comClusteringPushpinsin95fb729acontent relnofollowMSDN Samplea. Code contains some callback logic, some asyncawait usages. The problem is in mentioned earlier codeSetLocationcode. I dont know why it throws exceptions.p  pWhat Ive triedp  ol liIm working with MVVMLight, so experimented a lot with codeDispatcherHelper.CheckBeginInvokeOnUIcode. Nothing.li liTried to make sure whether creating the pushpin object happens in UI thread  I dont know how to do that in the debugger shall I check the tasks windows, or the threads window.li ol  pI dont post any code, because, as you can imagine, its quite a lot of it  and I dont know if that would be any of use. So, my question is, do you know what might cause throwing codeAccessViolationExceptioncode when invoking codeCheckBeginInvokeOnUIcode Maybe there are some kind of constraints that Im not aware of.p

Negative 1380 pI am trying to figure out where or how i should store application secrets and keys inside a desktop application.  brFor example a facebook app key or dropbox key and secret.brbr So Ive read that i should hash, salt, encrypt etc etc these values. This is to prevent someone from reverse engineering my code and seeing the keys. brbr The is all good and well, but with all these methods, im just storing a salt or hash value somewhere instead of the key itself, in the end. Surely if a hacker can get to the salthash and possibly the source code, they will be able to decrypt the encrypted key and get my passwordkeysecret anyway brbr One option Ive read about that seems the most secure is to not store this value in the desktop app at all, but to call a web service to obtain the key probably encrypted. But my question is, even in this case, a decent hacker will surely just do a memory dump or something to see what the value returned from the web service is, and then were back at square 1.p  pThe next best alternative seems to be obscurity. p  pAm I missing something completelyp  pOn a side note, what use will a facebooktwitterdropboxetc keysecret be to a hacker anyway Surely they would still need a users credentials or access token to be able to use it anywayp  pAny advice or suggestions will be appreciated.p

Negative 1380 pI developed a stupid game in eclipse not using any particular library such as libgdx, only with normal code. I have some doubts about the multiplayer and databases online. In my game I havent developed yet a database. So i thought I should have create a database online with mysql and connect to my android app. If so i would create users stored in my mysql online and the parse them with a json parser connecting to mysql trough some php based bridges. Then i searched for android multiplayer and i found out that a more efficient way to create login user is using google login offered by google.  Gived the fact that my database isnt only a way to let user log in but it is also a way to store tha stats about their matches, If i wanted to use g login, should I have a mysql database connecting to my app to store other data, or in a way that i actually ignore google provides these thingsp  pThe other doubt is about multiplayer what i should do to implement it Once the g login is implemented, then what should I implementp  pMatches between users are managed and stored completely by google or notp  pShould I have to add these informations in my DB online if at the point one the DB is needed.p  pSorry for my bad english. Hope you can help me. Thank you.p
Negative 1380 pI was working on a program and I noticed something that didnt really make a lot of sense to me. codestdstringcode has a function called codecstrcode which returns a Cstyle string NULLterminated representation of the codestdstringcode object. What does not make sense to me is how the codecstrcode function can return a codeconst char code without allocating it to the heap. The function seemingly returns the char array on the stack.p  pI have always thought a function could only return a valid pointer if the value it pointed to was allocated on the heap using a function like codemalloccode or codecalloccode.p  pHow can codecstrcode return the string without using the heap and could I somehow mimic this same behavior in my own codep  pThank you all in advance.p

Negative 1380 pIm developing a PointofSale solution to be deployed on an iPad. The application will be engineered as a web application.

Negative 1380 pIm just wandering what is the best approach to handle if Facebook is not installed on iOS device, but the app has some content to share.p  pE.g we would like to share Open Graph stories.

But it is ugly and does not support Open Graph.p  pSome developer just going to force user to login Start a codeFBSessioncode with codeFBSessionLoginBehaviorForcingWebViewcode. According to the FaceBook iOS sdk documentation, setting the behavior to FBSessionLoginBehaviorForcingWebView is supposed to force a web view to show where the user has to enter their credentials, yet in my app it just auto authorizes the currently logged in central userp  precode[session openWithBehaviorFBSessionLoginBehaviorWithNoFallbackToWebView     completionHandlerFBSession session,                         FBSessionState status,                         NSError error           Respond to session state changes,           ex updating the view     ] codepre  pOthers just show an alert with some with a messageYou cant send this right now, make sure your device has an internet connection and you have at least one Facebook account setup in Settings. and open the Settings app if the user is going to choose the right button.p  pUnfortunately I did not found any information how can the Social Framework handle if FaceBook is not installed or user is not logged in... I hoped that maybe it is redirect the user to the FaceBook setting page, but it does not able to handle it on this way.p  pSo I think the codeFBSessionLoginBehaviorWithNoFallbackToWebViewcode is the most promising but not so user friendly.

Negative 1380 pI have an android app in which i execute some task every 24 hours a day. For that I have registered a service and it runs first time and I have also used codeTimercode class in it to execute my method after a fix interval. It works perfect for first time but when I start the app next time, service starts from scratch and timer is reinitialized.I tried to handle this with shared preferences but no success.p  pCan you suggest me some ways to do some task in my app after exactly 24 hours until user deletes app.p

Negative 1380 pI want to display whitespace characters while debugging or editing text by replacing them with sensible Unicode code points and colouring them grey instead of black. e.g. replace SPACE codecode U0020 with MIDDLE DOT codecode U00B7, NOBREAK SPACE codecode U00A0 with MEDIUM SMALL WHITE CIRCLE codecode U26AC, etc. I will possibly use RIGHTWARDS ARROW FROM BAR codecode U21A6 instead of RIGHTWARDS ARROW codecode U2192 for TAB U0009.p  pIm looking for sensible glyphs for CARRIAGE RETURN U000D and newlineLINE FEED U000A. I dont want to use the PILCROW SIGN codecode U00B6 as it doesnt intuitively correspond to either but rather the concept of a new paragraph. There is also DOWNWARDS ARROW WITH CORNER LEFTWARDS codecode U21B5 but again, it seem more like a combination symbol than representing either one individually.p  pWhen I have mixed line endings I want to be able to see which character is being used or both. I am displaying the output in HTML in a browser.p  pCurrently I cant think of any better symbols than LEFTWARDS ARROW codecode U2190 for carriage return and DOWNWARDS ARROW codecode U2193 for newline. I am aware of SYMBOL FOR CARRIAGE RETURN codecode U240D, SYMBOL FOR LINE FEED codecode U240A and SYMBOL FOR NEWLINE codecode U2424 but the detail is hard to see on them, i.e. it is not quick to tell them apart.p  pI also dont want to use codercode and codencode for two reasons, codercode and codencode look a little similar not much, but a little and it takes two characters to display them instead of one. However, if I dont get any better suggestions I might alternatively use DOWNWARDS ARROW WITH CORNER LEFTWARDS codecode U21B5 for carriage return and RIGHTWARDS ARROW WITH CORNER DOWNWARDS codecode U21B4 for newline.p

Negative 1380 pIm facing the problem of computing values of a clothoid in C in realtime.p  pFirst I tried using the Matlab coder to obtain autogenerated C code for the quadgkintegrator for the Fresnel formulas. This essentially works great in my test scnearios. The only issue is that it runs incredibly slow in Matlab as well as the autogenerated code.p  pAnother option was interpolating a datatable of the unit clothoid connecting the sample points via straight lines linear interpolation. I gave up after I found out that for only small changes in curvature tiny steps along the clothoid the results were obviously degrading to lines. What a surprise...p  pI know that circles may be plotted using a different formula but low changes in curvature are often encountered in realworldscenarios and 30k sampling points in between the headings 0 and 360 didnt provide enough angular resolution for my problems.p  pThen I tried a Taylor approximation around the R  inf point hoping that there would be significant curvatures everywhere I wanted them to be. I soon realized I couldnt use more than 4 terms power of 15 as the polynom otherwise quickly becomes unstable probably due to numerical inaccuracies in double precision fpcomputation. Thus obviously accuracy quickly degrades for large t values. And by large t values Im talking about every point on the clothoid that represents a curve of more than 90 w.r.t. the zero curvature point.p  pFor instance when evaluating a road that goes from R150m to R125m while making a 90 turn Im way outside the region of valid approximation. Instead Im in the range of 204.5  294.5 whereas my Taylor limit would be at around 90 of the unit clothoid.p  pIm kinda done randomly trying out things now. I mean I could just try to spend time on the dozens of papers one finds on that topic. Or I could try to improve or combine some of the methods described above. Maybe there even exists an integrate function in Matlab that is compatible with the Coder and fast enough.p  pThis problem is so fundamental it feels to me I shouldnt have that much trouble solving it. any suggetionsp

Negative 1380 pIm trying to build a mobile app that has a login functionality with an ASP.NET web api, and I need to implement the token based authentication,p  pwhat I need is, as a first time the user login using username and password, a new token will be generated with expire date along with a refresh token, Im thinking of the refresh token because the user doesnt have to login every time the token expires,p  pthe token is saved in the mobile device and in the database, so with each request, sends the token whether in the request header or with the posted data,p  pstrongI dont exactly know how the token based authentication worksstrong in terms of sending the token encrypted or hashed to the user and processing the request in the serverp  pstrongEditstrong an attacker in the middle can just read the token and start sending requests to the server using the token. I mean he doesnt need to know what the token actually means.p  pI created a class that has these properties UserID,Token, RefreshToken, ExpiryDate, but I read that it is not a good approach, p  pIm using AES for encryption and SHA256 for hashp  pThank you for you help,p

Negative 1380 pI have scoured the interwebz with no result. We are facing a problem where some Android devices experience severe packet loss. To give some background, the application connects to a specific Wifi and looks for UDP packets broadcast on port 17216. These packets are of size 832 bytes, excluding the wrapped headers, and are sent at a regular rate of four per second.p  pWe have only met the problem on two devices, a lowend Turbox Rubik II tablet and an ASUS Memo Pad HD 7.

We are pulling our hair out.p  pstrongUpdatestrong I was mistaken about the packet sniffer.

And, as an additional comment, is worrying, at least for me, the very low rate shown in upgrading  core and community plugins to grails 3.x but, by other side, the unanswered number of questions here in stackoverflow is growing day by day, it seems most people is loosing interest in grails is it wrong my perception p  pSharing my conclusions, maybe be helpful for others. After digging a while, I have concluded that an all round support for types in java.time packages  tag libraries for web pages, controllers and databases is on development still. So, sadly, because of the heavy use of time types in my application under development I have to fall back to a safe place, that is, grails 2.3.11, java 1.7 and jodatime.p

Negative 1380 pWith new clojure 1.7 I decided to understand where I can use transducers.

And there examples use codexfcode as argument. First what means this xf or xfrom This stuff produced identity transducer.p  precodedefn myidentity [xf]   fn     []      println Arity 0.      xf    [result]      println Arity 1  result    xf result       xf result    [result input]      println Arity 2  result input    xf result input       xf result input codepre  pI took the naming of variables code[result input]code from documentation example. I thought its like in reduce function where coderesultcode is reduced part and codeinputcode is new collection element. p  pSo when I make codetransduce myidentity  range 5code I got result code10code what I was expecting. Then I read about codeeductioncode, but I cant understand what is it. Anyway I made codeeduction myidentity range 5code and gotp  precodeArity 2  nil 0    nil Arity 2  nil 1    nil Arity 1 nil    nil 0 0 1 1 codepre  pEvery item got duplicated because I call codexfcode in codeprintlncode statement.  Why it duplicated every item twice  Why I got nil  Will I always get nil while making an eduction  Can I relay on this behaviorp  pAnyway I didp  precodegt reduce  eduction myidentity range 5 clojure.core.Eduction cannot be cast to clojure.lang.IReduce codepre  pOk, the result is a codeEductioncode that is NOT reducible, but printed like a list.

Negative 1380 pIm working a a hrefhttpsgithub.comnexcessmagentoturpentineblobmasterappcodecommunityNexcessnetTurpentinemiscversion3.vcl relnofollowvarnish configuration I didnt writea, and this configuration seems to use codepasscode and codepipecode interchangeably.  Im a little unclear on what, exactly, the difference between these two actions is. p  pThe manual section on codepipecode is a little cryptic to mep  blockquote   pPipe can be returned from vclrecv as well. Pipe short circuits the client and the backend connections and Varnish will just sit there and shuffle bytes back and forth. Varnish will not look at the data being send back and forth  so your logs will be incomplete. Beware that with HTTP 1.1 a client can send several requests on the same connection and so you should instruct Varnish to add a Connection close header before actually returning pipe.p blockquote  pIm not sure what client theyre talking about when they say short circuit, or what short circuit means in this context, or how varnish shuffling bytes back and forth is different from its normal behavior.  i.e. this description is probably great for someone who understands varnishs implementation, but its a little confusing to someone me who understands varnishs role as pull the results for this HTTP request from memory, or pull the results for this HTTP requests from the application.p  pSo, given that context, what exactly is codepipecode doing thats different from codepasscodep  pspecific backend application Im working with is Magento, a PHP based ecommerce app, if that matters codemodphpcode, FastCGI, etc.p

Negative 1380 pWe have a massive repository that builds a very large application and produces gigabytes of files. Our build time is between 12 hours depending on the age  of the build agent.p  pMost of the time we need the continuous integration of the build, e.g check if it compiles, etc.p  pThen sometimes we want to create an installer out of this massive repo with data from various locations of the working directory its not only the BinRelease dirp  pIn Jenkins we did this by having two build jobs, one builds the code in his directory A and another job that creates the installer, but we forced its working directory to be set to A too.p  pNow we are testing TeamCity and I know things are different here.p  pIve been reading about snapshot and artifact dependency but I am not sure whether I get this right.p  pLets say the checked out and build workspace after the build is virtually the entire artefacts pool as we need many things from a lot of locations in this workspace, e.g. binaries, assets, include header, config files, docs, etc.p  pOne build with checkedout source and intermediate files is however about 30 Gb due to large set of external frameworks required to build and obj files. Without them the packaged thing would still be about 10 Gb and thousands of files.p  pIf I set up the dependent build to run on the same machine with the same build it will still have to effectively store 10 Gb of artefacts on server, with caches on an agent, right Even with cleanup the dependent build will need to receive the artefacts by copying them aroundp  pI looked around and did not find that TeamCity does some smart junction or softcopy of the data on the same agent just into another directory. Some of those assets are small and many, meaning that copying 10 gig is also quite slow.p  pAm I missing something about that concept I know I can change the working dir of the installer config too but since those are created by some hash checksum of the projects settings I tend to mess with them.p  pFor clarity This is c, a full rebuild and durations are acceptable although not fun for this size of the codebase.p

Negative 1380 pI have searched all over but cant seem to fix my problem. Somehow I am missing the solution to this problem. I am new to Muse, but quite familiar with html and css. I made this contact form in a text editor, it works perfect in DW and jsfiddle. Moment I insert it into Muse it crushes it. I have tried external style sheet, internal with Object insert, inline with Object insert. All give me the same result image below. Someone even suggested putting a external style sheet in the assets folder, I did and even tried the css folder and normal folder, no luck.p  pIs this possible to fix or does Muse not allow this type of thingp  pThanx in advance for all helpful replies.
