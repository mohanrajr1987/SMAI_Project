Positive 125 pSo this question has an obvious answer because the compiler wont let you but Im hoping someone can explain to me why this part of Swift works the way it does.p  pI ran into this question because I was building a view controller that needed to satisfy a protocol UIImagePickerControllerDelegate. The protocol requires a callback function to call after a user selected an image. I wanted to be able to change the callback behavior at runtime.p  pComing from a Python background, I figured that should be easy just define the callback method on my class to satisfy the protocol and then redefine it later by just reassigning to it. That works perfectly fine in Pythonp  precodeclass Fooobject     def barself         print bar  foo  Foo foo.bar   output bar  def baz     print baz  foo.bar  baz foo.bar   output baz codepre  pBut it doesnt work in Swift even though I can do very nearly the same thing by declaring a variable to hold a closurep  precodeimport UIKit  class Foo      func bar gt String          return bar           var baz gt String           return baz        let foo  Foo foo.bar   output bar foo.baz   output baz  let gee       return gee   foo.baz  gee foo.baz  output gee  foo.bar  gee   error cannot assign to bar in foo codepre  pSo the question...why does Swift work this way Its clearly not because its impossible to alter function routing at runtime otherwise the closure assignment wouldnt work. My best guess is that its analogous to the letvar distinction for variables and that using func is implicitly telling the compiler that a function should be immutable. And I grant that it may be better to make instance methods immutable by default. But it is annoying when we need to comply with rigid protocols from UIKit. At least it would be nice if I could use a variable to satisfy a function requirement in a protocol.p  pFor the curious I worked around this issue by declaring an instance variable to hold a closure that can be reassigned. I then declared the required protocol function and made it do nothing but call the closure. Which might cause a retain cycle, but works.p

Positive 125 pI would like to write a syntax extension that combines information from a related type when generating a new function.

The important distinction is that my extension does strongnotstrong know ahead of time which type or trait to look up  it would be provided by the user as an argument to the annotation.p  pI currently have a syntax extension that decorates a type, as I want to add methods.

Positive 125 pIm writing a compiler in a functional style. The type checker is currently fairly straightforward its mostly just a function from codeExprcode to codeTypecode.p  pNow, I want to add a step to the workflow that preserves the type information for later stages. There are a number of ways to do this symbol tables, etc., but a simple one is to translate into an IR that looks like the AST but contains type information. For example, if the AST data type isp  precodedatatype Expr  Literal of int                Add of Expr  Expr                ... codepre  pThen the typed IR would bep  precodetype TExpr  Type  TExpr datatype TExpr  TLiteral of int                  TAdd of TExpr  TExpr                  ... codepre  pSo my goal now is to convert my type checker into a type annotator a function codeExpr gt TExprcode instead of codeExpr gt Typecode. Heres my question emHow would you do this without adding a bunch of boilerplate clutter to the type checker functionemp  pNaively, I would need to add wrapping and unwrapping code all over the place, ruining the simple legibility of the type checker function as it stands. That is, the case for codeAddcode in the type checker currently looks likep  precodelet lhst  check lhs in let rhst  check rhs in case lhst, rhst of   Int, Int gt Int  ,  gt Error codepre  pNice and clean Exactly matches the typing judgment in the formalism p  pIf I mucked up the type checker with the additional translation logic, it would look like this now codecheckcode has type codeExpr gt TExprcodep  precode Recursive calls to translate the children.  let lhstyped  check lhs in let rhstyped  check rhs in  We dont care about the expression for checking, just the resulting   type. So extract that from each child.  let lhst,   lhstyped in let rhst,   rhstyped in case Int, Int gt    Construct a TExpr with the new type.    Int, TAdd lhstyped, rhstyped  ,  gt Error codepre  pThis has unpleasantly intermingled the interesting type checking logic with the boring boilerplate for destructing and constructing codeTExprcode. p  pIs there any way to separate these components That is, can the type checking logic live in one recursive function while the translation machinery acts as an external client of it Bonus points if its still easy to run the type checker emwithoutem doing translation if you want to.p  hr  pBonus context this follows the Separate IR option from a hrefhttpblog.ezyang.com201305theasttypingproblem relnofollowEdward Z.

Positive 125 pObjective To create a smaller version of node.js with the ultimate objective of creating a scripting language with some of the features of node JS and to add some of my own. p  pI understand, of course, that I need to look at the node.js source code but I could not find any parser code in the node.js source code on nodejs.org. Does node.js have its own parser possibly using yacc or some such tool as node.js is mostly written in C, C If so, where do I access it Or does it reply on the V8 engine source code for parsing JS I  believe that node.js language itself is not strictly V8 Javascript compliant. Or is it Since V8 compiles JS to native machine code, surely it must have a full fledged parsertranslator somewhere.p  pIn short, can someone point me to the parser code to let me knock out some of the unwanted grammar rules from the node.js parser Or is there some open source project already out there which has addressed this question p

Positive 125 pI am currently developing my own programming language designed to be used by game developers, dubbed the Motor Game Development Language. I am reading the book Compiler Design in C by Allen L. Holub, and so far its very good. I like the model of compilers it is going for, where there are four passes, but the book itself only covers the second pass being the lexical analyzer, parser, code generation, and a symbol table. That being said, I am having difficulty finding any good resources on writing a preprocessor as I do intend to have my own form of preprocessors like CC has, an optimizer, and what the book refers to as the back end which translates the optimized code into real assembly language or some form of binary, executable codep  pCould anyone point me to some good resourcesp  pIm interested in both theory and practice as I tend to learn better when I see it both ways.p

I could not understand what optimization is done by O3 flag in such a way that we get lot of speed in execution.p  pAny link,doc or an explaination regarding O3 optimizationapart from gcc.gnu.org, which I have seen and found the info given there is not sufficient to provide me a decent explaination and insight of what goes on is much appreciated.p
Positive 125 pi read a lot about coding standards and tools to help you find code that needs to be improved. What i dont get is why compilers dont integrate this and enforce you to code in a certain way.p  pIn my opinion it does not really matter what kind of coding standard you are using as long as there is one. It would be easier to share code as the standard is the same. I dont see negative sides to this approach.p  pSo why is it not done like thisp
Positive 125 pI use Luabind to manually bind my classes to Lua. Each time I write a new class, I  do this binding manually.

Positive 125 pI would create a emdata binding code generatorem for a specified programming language and for a specified serialization format given a specification for the structure of data to be serialized or deserialized, the intended code generator should generate the classes in the specified programming language that represent the given vocabulary as well as the methods for serialization and deserialization using the specified format. The intended code generator could require the following inputsp  ul lithe emtarget programming languageem, that is the programming language for generating the codeli lithe emtarget serialization formatem, that is the serialization format for the datali lithe specification of the structure of data to be serialized or deserialized.li ul  pSince initially I would like to create a simple code generator, the first version of this software could require only define the specification of the structure of data to be serialized or deserialized, so I choose C as target programming language and XML as target serialization format. Essentially, the intended code generator should be a Java software which reads the specification of the structure of data to be serialized or deserialized this specification must be written in according to a given grammar, and generates the C classes that represent the given vocabulary these classes should have the methods for serialization and deserialization in XML format. The purpose of the intended code generator is to generate one or more classes, so that they could be embedded in a C project.p  pRegarding the specification of the structure of data to be serialized or deserialized, it could be defined as in the following examplep  precodesimple type Message int id, string content codepre  pGiven the specification in the above example, the intended code generator could generate the following C classp  precodepublic class Message      public int Id  get set       public string Content  get set       public byte[] Serialize               ...           public void Deserializebyte[] data               ...       codepre  pI read about a hrefhttpwww.antlr.org relnofollowANTLRa and I believe that this tool is perfect for the just explained purpose. As explained in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma1932664this answera, I should first create a grammar for the specification of the structure of data to be serialized or deserialized.p  pThe above example is very simple, because it defines only a simple type, but the specification of the structure of data could be more complex, so we could have a emcompound typeem which includes one or more simple types, or lists, etc., like in the following examplep  precodesimple type LogInfo DateTime time, String message simple type LogSource String class, String version compound type LogEntry LogInfo info, LogSource source codepre  pMoreover, the specification of the data could include also one or more constraints, like in the following examplep  precodesimple type Message int id constraint not negative, string content codepre  pIn this case, the intended code generator could generate the following C classp  precodepublic class Message      private int id     private string content      public int Id              get  return id          set                      if value lt 0                 throw new ArgumentException...              id  value                    public string Content              get  return content          set  content  value            public byte[] Serialize               ...           public void Deserializebyte[] data               ...       codepre  pEssentially, the intended code generator should find all userdefined types, any constraints, etc ..

Recently I changed to Eclipse 3.4 ganymede, and I have a problem, concerning debugging. Before, whenever the debugger was hitting a breakpoint, Eclipse would blink in the windows taskbar, to notify about it. But since switching to 3.4, it doesnt blink anymore, so, to debug a Swing application, it can easily get annoying, because you dont see directly when you entered a breakpoint.p  pIn other informations, Im using Eclipse 3.4 over the previous workspace, so I thought it might be a problem, with using the previous settings, but after trying on a brand new workspace, I encountered the same issue. I tried to search about it in the Eclipse community, but nothing like this so far.p  pHas anyone ever had that problem  And if yes, is there a way to make it work p  phrp  pstrongEditstrong For information, updating to Eclipse 3.5 galileo didnt solve the issue, so Im guessing its not linked to only the previous update. Something probably changed since version 3.2, which is now preventing the usual blinking behavior. I cant figure out what, though.p
Negative 125 pIm building an application where I end up with a fairly long list of repeated elements that need to be configured based on some objects Im getting via AJAX. Im thinking about creating one of these elements in html and leaving it hidden on the page and then cloning this element and using jQuery to modify it based on the object Im getting back ie set its text, href etc... From a performance standpoint would this be faster or slower than more traditional dom generation where I would create the entire element in javascript rather than starting with a cloned elementp

He mentions 3 possible solutions afterwards  nonblocking IO, threading out, and placing a timeout on the IO operations.  p  pMy question is, are there any other ways of avoiding such an attack  And if not, which of these is the best  I glanced over the section on placing a timeout on the operations, but it doesnt look like something I want to do.  The methods he suggests for doing it look pretty complex and Im not sure how to work them into what I already have.

Negative 125 pI have a C program which reads files from the hard disk and does some processing on the data in the files. I am using standard Win32 APIs to read the files. My problem is that this program is blazingly fast some times and then suddenly slows down to 16th of the previous speed. If I read the same files again and again over multiple runs, then normally the first run will be the slowest one. Then it maintains the speed until I read some other set of files. So my obvious guess was to profile the disk access time. I used perfmon utility and measured the IO Read Bytessec for my program. And as expected there was a huge difference  5 times in the number of bytes read. My questions arep  p1. Does OS Windows in my case cache the recently read files somewhere so that the subsequent loads are fasterp  p2. If I can guarantee that all the files I read reside in the same directory then is there any way I can place them in the hard disk so that my disk access time is fasterp  pIs there anything I can do for thisp

Negative 125 pI suppose this issue applies to deadlocks, livelocks, or just lock wait timeouts.  p  pIm trying to figure out what query is causing a lock that is preventing another query from executing.  Oracle has if memory serves a LOCK table that you can join onto itself to determine which queries are locking others.  I need a way to accomplish the same this in MySQL.p  pThe scenario is that we have longrunning jobs that occasionally create a nested transaction that updates the progress field.  That way, were not losing the transactionalness of the work while keeping the user informed of the progress i.e. percent complete.  The nested transaction sometimes throws a lock timeout exception.p  pThis is very odd, since none of the other work should write  or even read  from the Job table.  Sifting through the raw SQL log confirms this.

Negative 125 pI am new to Linq to SQL, but I am surprised at the problems I am having updating a table.

Negative 125 pIm trying to get into unit testing with C. Various people told me to go with NUnit since its better than MSTest apparently, I have no idea and it also has very good support in ReSharper which Im using.p  pNow Ive never written a unit test before in my life bear with me, Im a university student. ReSharper has this nice CreateUnitTests context menu option that Ive seen others casually looking over the shoulder use to great success. You rightclick in a method, select CreateUnitTests and there you go, a test skeleton is created. You just fill in the important bits.p  pNow when I try the same, ReSharper wants me to create a new Test Project... and when I let it, it creates what Im assuming a MSTest project with obviously a MSTest test template. But I already have a class libarary project which references nunit.framework and has a few NUnit tests that ReSharper is more than willing to run. Still, it only ever creates MSTest test templates, and only ever in special Test Project projects.p  pWhat am I doing wrong Am I doing something wrong at all, or is creating NUnit test templates not possible with ReSharper Ive searched the net and read the documentation of ReSharper and NUnit and I still cant figure out is this even possible or what.p  pId be grateful if anyone could provide me with a sort of guide to using ReSharper  NUnit.  p  pEDIT Im using ReSharper 4.5 and NUnit 2.5.3p  pEDIT2 Apparently Im an idiot. CreateUnitTests is not part of ReSharper, but part of Visual Studio and thus only ever works with MSTest.p

Negative 125 pIm a front end developer, and Ive been trying to get a hang on using Jinja2 effectively. I want to tweak a current site so it has multiple base templates using inheritance, it fully uses block tags to substitute content and override it, and uses macros to support passing of arguments.p  pMy base template contains this code edited for simplicityp  precodeltDOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC W3CDTD HTML 4.01EN httpwww.w3.orgTRhtml4strict.dtdgt  from foo.html import macro1, macro2, macro3   macro basetemplatetitlenone, arg2none, urls, arg3false  lthtmlgt   lttitlegt title   Site.comlttitlegt   ....    caller    .... lthtmlgt  endmacro    block content  endblock  codepre  pAnd my pages that extend it look like thisp  precode extends base.html   block content   call basetemplatetitlehome, arg2active, arg3true  html code here  endcall   endblock  codepre  pSo basically all the pages extend base, they call a macro and pass arguments to that macro. I dont quite understand it all, but the main point is that this allows default values and a degree of flexibility that doesnt require redefining an entire block it gives some degree of flexibility and power. Again this is heavily simplified.p  pThe only problem is, this negates my ability to use blocks. Macros are for flexibility, but with blocks, I have the ability to override something entirely, or use its parents contents and add to it, which I cant do with Macros at least I dont think. The problem is, I cant wrap things in blocks, else they wont see the values in the macro. For instance, doing thisp  precode block title lttitlegt title   Site.comlttitlegt endblock  codepre  pWill fail because it will say title is undefined. p  pUltimately I am looking for a way to utilize both the power and organiztional aspects of blocks, but still be able to utilize the logic amp terseness of macros. If anyone could give me any help as to how I might go about this problem, I would really appreciate it.p

Negative 125 pI am not sure how to deal with floating point exceptions in either C or C. From wiki, there are following types of floating point exceptionsp  blockquote precodeIEEE 754 specifies five arithmetic errors that are to be recorded in sticky bits by default note that trapping and other alternatives are optional and, if provided, nondefault.     inexact, set if the rounded and returned value is different from the mathematically exact result of the operation.    underflow, set if the rounded value is tiny as specified in IEEE 754 and inexact or maybe limited to if it has denormalisation loss, as per the 1984 version of IEEE 754, returning a subnormal value including the zeroes.    overflow, set if the absolute value of the rounded value is too large to be represented an infinity or maximal finite value is returned, depending on which rounding is used.    dividebyzero, set if the result is infinite given finite operands returning an infinity, either  or .    invalid, set if a realvalued result cannot be returned like for sqrt1, or 00, returning a quiet NaN. codepre blockquote  pIs it that when any type of above exceptions happens, the program will exit abnormally Or the program will carry this error on without mentioning anything and therefore make the error hard to debug p  pIs a compiler like gcc able to give warning for some obvious casep  pWhat can I do during coding my program to notify where the error happens and what types it is when it happens, so that I can locate the error easily in my code Please give solutions in both C and C case.p  pThanks and regardsp
Negative 125 pI am trying to construct a basic control that will display an undecorated JFrame right below it when a button is clicked.  I am trying to mimic drop down type functionality, but with my own Frame instead of a panel.  My component contains a class member of the JFrame derived control that I would like it to show.  In certain situations, when setVisible is called, the contents of this JFrame are not painted.

The strange thing is this issue appears only on my Windows 7 machine, but not on an XP machine.p  pHere is a very basic sample that demonstrates the problem.

Negative 125 pThis may be a duplicate, but I havent found anything that answers it thus far.  My company passed a resolution that all files need to have a boilerplate comment header, with file name and copyright date among other things.  I was hoping there would be an easy way to just create a header template that is added to the top of every new class .cpp and .h files added to the project with a couple of variables that are replaced based on the date, file name, etc.p  pUnfortunately, it seems like this is a much larger task that it seems it should be.  Ive looked into a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms22877028VS.10029.aspxManipulating Code using the Visual C Code Modela and a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms24711328VS.8029.aspxManually Creating an Item Templatea and cant seem to get any of them to do what I want.  p  pSorry if this sounds like a do my work for me post, but to me this just isnt worth spending that much time on.  If its going to take a day to figure out the subtleties of extending Visual Studio, I can just manually add and edit the header for each new file, as it isnt done that often.  Is there an easier method than those I was looking at, or a simple example on how to utilize those methods for my purposep
Negative 125 pIm working with DataNucleus as part of a Google App Engine project and Im having a bit of trouble with columns in persistence.p  precodePrimaryKeycolumn  userid Columnname  userid Persistentname  userid, column  userid, valueStrategy  IdGeneratorStrategy.IDENTITY private Key mid  Columnname  username Persistentname  username, column  username private String muserName codepre  pIf you cant tell, Im trying to name the column something different than the name of the variable because I have two naming conventions one works better in Java, one works better in SQL.

Negative 125 pI have a data processing system that generates very large reports on the data it processes. By large I mean that a small execution of this system produces about 30 MB of reporting data when dumped into a CSV file and a large dataset is about 130150 MB Im sure someone out there has a bigger idea of large but thats not the point...  p  pExcel has the ideal interface for the report consumers in the form of its Data Lists users can filter and segment the data onthefly to see the specific details that they are interested in because theyre not really interested in the many thousands of rows, they know how to apply multiple filters to get the data they want  they can also add notes and markup to the reports, create charts, graphs, etc... They know how to do all this and its much easier to let them do it if we just give them the data.p  pExcel was great for the small test datasets, but it cannot handle these large ones. Does anyone know of a tool that can provide a similar interface as Excel data lists  the ability to dynamically create and change filters on multiple fields but can handle much larger files p  pThe next tool I tried was MS Access, and found that the Access file bloats hugely 30 MB input file leads to about 70 MB Access file, and when I open the file, run a report and close it the files at 120150 MB, the import process is slow and very manual currently, the CSV files are created by the same plsql script that runs the main process so theres next to no intervention on my part. I also tried an Access database with linked tables to the database tables that store the report data and that was many times slower for some reason, sqlplus could query and generate the report file in a minute or soe while Access would take anywhere from 25 minutes for the same datap  pIf it helps, the data processing system is written in PLSQL and runs on Oracle 10g.p

Negative 125 pMy app consist of the mainprocess and two threads, all running concurrently and making use of three fifoqueuesp  pThe fifoqs are Qmain, Q1 and Q2. Internally the queues each use a counter that is incremented when an item is put into the queue, and decremented when an item is geted from the queue.p  pThe processing involve two threads,br  QMaster, which get from Q1 and Q2, and put into Qmain,br  Monitor, which put into Q2,br  and the main process, which get from Qmain and put into Q1.p  pThe QMasterthread loop consecutively checks the counts of Q1 and Q2 and if any items are in the qs, it gets them and puts them into Qmain.p  pThe Monitorthread loop obtains data from external sources, package it and put it into Q2.p  pThe mainprocess of the app also runs a loop checking the count of Qmain, and if any items, gets an item  from Qmain at each iteration of the loop and process it further. During this processing it occasionally puts an item into Q1 to be processed later when it is geted from Qmain in turn.p  pThe problembr  Ive implemented all as described above, and it works for a randomly short time and then hangs.

Lets say me servlet is declared and mapped like this  p  precode ltservletgt   ltservletnamegtMainControllerltservletnamegt   ltservletclassgtcontroller.controllers.MainControllerltservletclassgt  ltservletgt   ltservletmappinggt   ltservletnamegtMainControllerltservletnamegt   lturlpatterngtservletMainControllerlturlpatterngt  ltservletmappinggt codepre  pThe problem is that I use this code in my Servlet  p  precodethis.getServletContext            .getRequestDispatcherdestination.forwardrequest, response codepre  pThe codedestinationcode parameter is always a code.jspcode at the root of my webapp juste like index.jsp, home.jsp, etc.p  pWhen I was using my application on localhost my servlet had this url pattern p  precodelturlpatterngtMainControllerlturlpatterngt codepre  pand everything was working fine because the request dispatcher was always searching the .jsp at the root of the webapp. But now with my new urlpattern, it tries to serch all my .jsp at servlet just like codeservletindex.jspcode and, of corse throw me a codeHTTP Status 404  servletindex.jspcodep  pI perfectly understand why its acting like that as, if I recall well, Servlets cannot extend outside their current context.p  pBut my question is, am I doomed  Isnt there a way to tell to the request dispatcher to go to the .jsp Im asking without taking care of the servlet pattern  I absolutely need the requests object because I work with it before forwarding it.p  pI do really dont know how to get through this, so Im seeking some help here hoping that someone had already faced this situation or at least have a clearer vision of the situation than me.p  pThanks for taking the time to read this and for helping me.p  pBest regards,p  pSampawende.p
Negative 125 pThis may initially seem generic, but in fact, I am actually making the decision on which I need to use.p  pWhat I am currently working on involves Employment Applications, those in which will need to be marked at some point bActiveb or bInactiveb. When an application is submitted, it will default to bActiveb. For certain reasons, it might later be set to bInactiveb. It can only be one of these and never bnullbIn case this changes anything.p  pI am using this with bJava  Hibernate  PostgresSQLb, in case this also makes any difference. My first instinct is to use bBooleanb as my solution so that it truly acts as a flag, but I have coworkers who have suggested using benumsb or bintsb as more of a status rather then a flag. p  pI have solved problems such as this using all of the above solutions, and they all seem somewhat transparent to eachother. p  pbIs there one way that is better for this situationbp

Negative 125 pI am trying to create an intro animation for my iOS app and am having issues with timing. In particular I would like to change screens after the intro animation plays. I currently use a UIImageView and there does not appear to be a way to do this. Many stackoverflow questions say to use an NSTimer or performSelectorafterDelay but these are not accurate timers and in my case are completely wrong. Here is what I am doing.p  ol liSet UILaunchImageFile to LaunchImage.pngli liAppDelegate allocs an IntroViewControllerli liIntroViewController.LoadView allocs IntroViewli liIntroView.initWithFrame performs the following    UIImageView iv      iv.animationImages      iv.animationDuration  2.0    iv.animationRepeatCount  1    [iv startAnimating]li liSet NSTimerperformSelectorafterDelayli liWhen timer triggers change from IntroViewController to something else.li ol  pIf I perform either step 5 or 6 it does not work correctly. It does correctly play the animation and it will correctly change the viewview controller, but the timing is horribly horribly wrong. When you call startAnimating in this manner it may not actually start the animation for a full second or two. I presume because the app is still loading in resources somehow. This time however is not consistent across the simulator or all devices. Infact several runs on the same device may have different results. Thus I can not hard code some delay.p  pAll I want to do is detect that a UIImageView animation has played the last frame and do something. Thats it. The best solution Ive found so far is to set a timer in some manner and then do something, but in my situation a timer is not a solution.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 125 pIs it possible to have an issues list in sharepoint where users can only see their assigned issues and not othersp  pI dont think its possible, since I believe views cannot be permission based. p  pUpdatep  pMy security restraint has been relaxed after review, so I wont have to worry about the saavy user manipulating the url ids, etc. I just dont want the user to be able to see a view called All Issues in the drop down list. Somehow hide this view by obscurity. Ideally, the user would only see a view called My Issues.  However, I need an All Issues view for the contribute user to assign issues.  The users being assigned issues only need readaccess to their issues.p  pI was thinking of adding a master issues list where the contribute user would maintain and have a sync routine that Ive already written that would sync all the items to another issues list that only exposes the Assigned To equal to [Me] view default or can this be done easier by just having one list and somehow hide the All view from regulars users or something I dont want the user clicking All Site Content and selecting the list to find the All view. p

Negative 125 pI am curious as to how applications generate their own data that is used with the application itself. For example, if you take any kind of PC games save file or some sort of program that generates binary data like Photoshops PSD files or .torrent files for BitTorrent applications, Id assume they are all specific to the corresponding application and that the authors of that application programmed the way this data was created. My first question is is that true I am 99 positive that it is binary data because when opening a PSD file or a .torrent file in Notepad, its easy to see that its nothing that can be read by a human...p  pMy second question is if I wanted to make an application that generates its own data in binary format no plaintext or anything thats easily manipulated, how would I go about handling this data I can vaguely picture generating this data and saving it to a file in binary format, but I am really stuck on how Id handle this data when its needed by the application again. Since this type of data is not plain text and cant be treated as a string or anything like that, how is it that applications create and handleparse their own binary data or any binary data in generalp  pI can obviously see that when you open a PSD file, Photoshop opens and it displays whatever the PSD file contained.

Unlike a codeconstcode object, the value of a macro does not appear in the intermediate source code used by the compiler because they are expanded inline. The inline expansion makes the macro value unavailable to the debugger.pli   lipA macro can be used in a constant expression, such as an array bound, whereas a codeconstcode object cannot.  I think we surely need to use macro to define codearraysizecode.pli   lipThe compiler does not typecheck a macro, including macro arguments.pli   ol blockquote

The debate over checked vs unchecked exceptions has ensued.p  pTaking a note from the designers of JPAHibernate et all., I have suggested that unchecked exceptions may be most appropriate. My argument being that users of the API cannot be reasonably expected to recover from these exceptions and in 99 of the cases we can at best notify the application user that some error has occurred. p  pHaving runtime exceptions propagate up to generic handling mechanisms will obviously reduce a lot of the complexity and required branch handling involved in dealing with edgecase exceptions. But, there is a lot of concern surrounding such an approach rightly so. p  pWhy have the designers of such projects as JPAEJB and Hibernate selected to go with an unchecked exception model Is there a very good justification for it What are the proscons. Should developers using these frameworks still handle the runtime exceptions close to where they are thrown with something like adapter wrappersp  pI hope answers to these questions can help us to make the right decision regarding our own service layer.p

Negative 125 pFirstly, a bit about my setup.p  pI have a primitive database of three tables p  pstrongA.strong Table that lists various locations [locationcode], [locationname]p  pstrongB.strong Table that describes items [itemcode], [itemname], [itemprice]p  pand finally a table that ties the rooHHH whole database togetherp  pstrongC.strong Table says which items are stored at each locations and in what quantities [locationcode], [itemcode], [itemquantity]. This table can have multiple entries with the same [locationcode], since different items can be stored at the same location. Basically, this is a schoolbook implementation of onetomany relationship from locations to items, with a extra attribute quantity attached to each locationitem link.p  pNow, all I need to do is to create a form that would list all items stored at certain location. This is a basic usecase for subform feature in Access. The main form simply navigates through different locations, while the subform lists the items. p  pI usep  precodeSELECT C.locationcode, B.itemname, B.itemcode, B.itemprice, C.itemquantity  FROM B INNER JOIN C ON B.itemcodeC.itemcode codepre  pas a record source for the subform. The main form is linked to subform by [locationcode]. The subform is set up with list layout not table layout, i.e. each database field is given its own control element.p  pSo far everything works perfectly. I select the location in the main form, and the subform gives me a list of editable [itemname][itemprice][itemquantity] triplets for the current location.p  pAs the next step, I want to add a calculated control to each of the above triplets. I want to know the total price for each kind of item i.e. simply the code[itemprice]  [itemquantity]code in each line. Easy, I add a calculated control to the repeatable area of the subform and specifyp  precode [itemprice]  [itemquantity] codepre  pas the formula for the value. Again, everything works perfectly. Now instead of the above triplets, my list has four entries per line [itemname][itemprice][itemquantity][totalitemprice]. And, what is important, when I edit [itemprice] or [itemquantity], the [totalitemprice] gets automatically reevaluated once I finish editing.p  pAnd as the final step, I want to add another calculated control that would display the total price of all items stored at the current location lets call it grand total. A also place that control into the subform into the footnote area this time and specify the following formula as its valuep  precode SUM[itemprice]  [itemquantity] codepre  pNow, this works. The total value is calculated correctly each time I change the location in the main form. Also, when I change [itemprice] for any item at the current location, the grand total is also updated automatically. However, when I change [itemquantity], the grand total does not update . Hitting F9 will make it update. Changing the current location back and forth will update it. But, unfortunately, a mere change to [itemquantity] does not trigger an automatic update.p  pDoes anyone know, what could be wrong here Why do changes in [itemprice] trigger the automatic update of the grand total, while changes in [itemquantity] do not Intuitively, these fields seem to have the same status except that the former comes from table B, while the latter comes from table C. Why is the behavior different How do I make it update automaticallyp

Negative 125 pI will go ahead and preface this by saying I am somewhat new to WCF.p  pIm working on a serverside routine thats responsible for doing a great deal of business logic. Its accessible from a client via WCF.p  pMy main WCF method calls off to several other private methods. Instead of passing around all of the lookup data I need for the business logic to each private method, I decided to use a singleton instance of a class named DataProvider that contains all of this lookup data.p  pAt the end of the routine, I release the DataProviders lookup data so the next time the routine is executed, the latest lookup data will be used.p  pSo, heres a simplified examplep  precode public void Generate         try                   populate singleton DataProvider with its lookup data...            DataProvider.Instance.LoadLookupData             do business logic...              finally                   release providers lookup data...            DataProvider.Release          codepre  pThis works great until I have two different clients that execute the method at or near the same time. Problems occur because they share the same singleton instance and the task who finishes first will release the DataProvider before the other completes.p  pSo...p  pWhat are my options here p  pId like to avoid passing around all of the lookup data so the singleton pattern or some derivative seems like a good choice. I also need to be able to support multiple clients calling the method at the same time.p  pI believe the WCF service is configured as PerCall. Im not sure if theres a way to configure a WCF service so that the static memory is not shared between service invocations.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p

Negative 125 pAt first my code set up the SDL environment, and proceeded to update the OpenGL context, without performing any SDLEvent processing whatsoever. This causes the window, as long as it was open, to appear to Windows to be unresponsive. The window flickers a bit. The titlebar would get Not Responding appended to it, and upon clicking inside the window it becomes grayed out, as Windows does this by default on non responsive windows. However in this state even as and after it becomes grayed out, the OpenGL display continues to update and animate, and heres the kicker, it even does so emwhile the window is being draggedem. Clearly in this case the application isnt handling events from windows correctly, causing windows to think that it is in a hanged state. But there is clear evidence that the opengl continues to render. p  pNow I make one single modification to the code, which is these three lines placed in an appropriate spot inside the loop which also does the OpenGL draw p  precodeSDLEvent event if SDLPollEventampevent ampamp event.type  SDLQUIT     break codepre  pAll this is doing is flushing the message queue using SDL. p  pNow the behavior is that Windows no longer thinks it is Not Responding and it does not get grayed out. No flicker. Everything seems to run swimmingly. But once I click and drag the title bar to drag the window, rendering gets blocked. I havent debugged it to be sure, but I suspect that SDLPollEvent blocks for the duration of the window drag. p  pIs there a way around this This is interesting because part of the behavior exhibited by emfailing to handle eventsem is proof that what I want is possible in theory.p  pUpdate I found this thread a hrefhttpwww.gamedev.nettopic488074win32messagepumpandopenglrenderingpauseswhiledraggingresizinghttpwww.gamedev.nettopic488074win32messagepumpandopenglrenderingpauseswhiledraggingresizingap  pThe verdict seems to be that it comes down to certain choices that Microsoft made for us... It basically gets stuck in codeDefWindowProccode till the mouse is released. It would get very messy to hack a fix for this and I might be able to do a work around by rendering in another thread. But I dont even want to begin to think about juggling an OpenGL context from multiple threads, if thats even something thats possible.p

Negative 125 pUsing Doxygen 1.7.4p  pSometimes Ill have a block of public member functions that belong strongin a member groupstrong and that I feel are self documenting e.g. getterssetters, so I dont want to write Doxygen syntax for each one. However, I may need to add something like a codenotecode to one or two of them. Also, I emdoem still want the function declarations to show up in the classs member list in the final documentation. Therefore, using codecondcode, codeendcondcode wont work. Ive noticed that if all parent elements are documented and Doxygen encounters an undocumented function in a member group, it will repeat the first documentation it encountered in that group, even if that documentation was for a function of a different name, as suchp  precode name Group1      void setA int i  int  getA void    note This note unexpectedly repeated for all functions in this group void setB int i   int  getB void  void setC int i  int  getC void   codepre  pTo anybody reading the code and documentation, it should be obvious that the note should only apply to codesetBcode.p  pThis particular problem goes away if I remove the surrounding member group. However, that defeats the documentation purpose that these functions somehow belong together, and Doxygen then complains warns that the functions arent documented. Ive tried adding empty special comment blocks and empty codebriefcode and codenotecode commands, all to no avail.p  pI also encounter this phenomenon when documenting overloaded functions in a member group. If my overloaded function uses a different number of parameters and different parameter names, Ill document that function separately. However, sometimes two functions will only differ by the parameter type. In this case, my workaround has been to use the codeoverloadcode command. However, Id prefer to not have to do this, and this workaround does not apply semantically for functions of a different name.p  pSo, is there any workaround to this repetition problemp

Negative 125 pIm wondering if theres a way in Java to synchronize using two lock objects.  I dont mean locking on emeitherem object, I mean locking only on embothem.p  pe.g. if I have 4 threadsp  ul liThread A requests a lock using Object1 and Object2li liThread B requests a lock using Object1 and Object3li liThread C requests a lock using Object4 and Object2li liThread D requests a lock using Object1 and Object2li ul  pIn the above scenario, Thread A and Thread D would share a lock, but Thread B and Thread C would have their own locks. Even though they overlap with one of the two objects, the same lock only applies if it overlaps on both.p  pSo I have a method called by many threads which is going to perform a specific activity type based on a specific database. I have identifier objects for both the database and the activity, and I can guarantee that the action will be thread safe as long as it is not the same activity based on the same database as another thread.p  pMy ideal code would look something likep  precodepublic void doActivityDatabaseIdentifier dbID, ActivityIdentifier actID          synchronized dbID, actID    lt Not real Java         Do an action that can be guaranteed threadsafe per unique         combination of dbIT and actID, but needs to share a          lock if they are both the same.       codepre  pI could create a hashmap of lock objects that are keyed by both the DatabaseIdentifier and the ActivityIdentifier, but Im going to run into the same synchronization issue when I need to createaccess those locks in a threadsafe way.p  pFor now Im just synchronizing on the DatabaseIdentifier. Its much less likely that there will be multiple activities going on at the same time for one DBIdentifier, so I will only rarely be overlocking. Cant say the same for the opposite direction though.p  pAnyone have a good way to handle this that doesnt involve forcing unnecessary threads to waitp  pThanksp

Negative 125 pIs it possible to get a list of the files that are currently selected in Windows Explorer from my C appp  pI have done a lot of research on different methods of interacting with Windows Explorer from a managed language like C.

Negative 125 pBackground I am working on an Android Honeycomb v3.0 application that has a requirement of communicating with the Google Calendar API. I would like to allow my application to access a particular Google accounts Calendar data in order to read and create events. I have figured out how to to this through the help of a hrefhttpcode.google.comapiscalendarv3using.html relnofollowthis tutoriala and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8435228googlecalendarapioauth2troublesonandroidhoneycombthis threada that I have previously posted on stackoverflow.p  pMy requirements I would like to allow a user to add guests to the events. There are two types of guests people and meeting rooms. I know how to add people as guests to an event, but I have no idea how to add rooms. The way room invitations are supposed to work are as followsp  p1 Room is added to the eventp  p2 The event is createdp  p3 Room automatically responds to the invitation by eitherp  ul lipAccepting the invitation to the event and displaying it on the rooms own calendarpli lipRejecting the invitationpli ul  pThe screenshot below displays how the Google Calendar inbrowser UI handles thisp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comiHlBL.jpg altGoogle Calendar inbrowser UIp  pAs you can see, I have added room 109 as a guest. If room 109 is available which it is, because only available rooms are shown, it will accept the event invitation and add the event to its own calendar.p  pMy problem I have learned that I can check the freebusy times of a particular calendar by using the Google Calendar API as described a hrefhttpcode.google.comapiscalendarv3using.htmlfreebusy relnofollowherea. However, I am not sure whether there is a special procedure for inviting the room to be a location for the event see the Where textbox in the screenshot.

Negative 125 pWhat would you consider a clean and efficient way to initially populate a data storage which is part of a RESTful distributed system architecture  p  pWe do already have a POST method for bulk importing which takes an XML feed, parses, validates and imports the data. So one possibility would require the client to POST against our REST interface probably in chunks, if we ran into timeout problems with the request.p  pThe data store itself is based on MongoDB, so on the other hand side you could also think about a lowlevel bulk import, which takes a gzipped data file, uncompresses it and directly import the JSON data into the database which of course would circumvent our business logic to validate the data to import. p  pWhat is your opinion and recommendation, are there any REST pattern which gives an advice on this problemp

Unfortunately, it looks like the statement for .reserveQuantity is being committed immediately, even though the whole method should run within its own transaction.p  pHere is the log..p  precode    130928.007 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG org.hibernate.impl.SessionImpl  opened session at timestamp 13291529680 130928.008 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG o.s.o.hibernate3.SessionFactoryUtils  Registering Spring transaction synchronization for new Hibernate Session 130928.009 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG o.s.orm.hibernate3.HibernateTemplate  Found threadbound Session for HibernateTemplate 130928.011 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG org.hibernate.jdbc.AbstractBatcher  about to open PreparedStatement open PreparedStatements 0, globally 0 130928.011 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG org.hibernate.jdbc.ConnectionManager  opening JDBC connection 130928.012 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG o.s.j.d.DriverManagerDataSource  Creating new JDBC DriverManager Connection to [jdbcdb2172.26.10.14460000devdb] 130928.189 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG org.hibernate.SQL  update deal set remainingquantityremainingquantity, updatedon, updatedby where id and remainingquantitygt 130928.242 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG org.hibernate.jdbc.AbstractBatcher  about to close PreparedStatement open PreparedStatements 1, globally 1 130928.243 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG org.hibernate.jdbc.ConnectionManager  transaction completed on session with onclose connection release mode be sure to close the session to release JDBC resources 130928.244 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG o.s.orm.hibernate3.HibernateTemplate  Not closing prebound Hibernate Session after HibernateTemplate 130928.245 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG o.s.o.hibernate3.SessionFactoryUtils  Flushing Hibernate Session on transaction synchronization 130928.246 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG o.s.o.hibernate3.SessionFactoryUtils  Registering Hibernate Session for deferred close 130930.524 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG o.s.o.hibernate3.SessionFactoryUtils  Opening Hibernate Session 130930.525 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG org.hibernate.impl.SessionImpl  opened session at timestamp 13291529705 130930.534 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG o.h.e.def.AbstractSaveEventListener  delaying identityinsert due to no transaction in progress 130930.537 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG o.h.e.def.AbstractSaveEventListener  delaying identityinsert due to no transaction in progress 130930.540 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG o.h.e.def.AbstractSaveEventListener  delaying identityinsert due to no transaction in progress 130930.543 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG o.h.e.def.AbstractSaveEventListener  delaying identityinsert due to no transaction in progress 130930.549 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG o.h.e.def.AbstractSaveEventListener  delaying identityinsert due to no transaction in progress 130930.551 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG o.s.orm.hibernate3.HibernateTemplate  Eagerly flushing Hibernate session 130930.552 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG o.h.e.d.AbstractFlushingEventListener  processing flushtime cascades 130930.554 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG o.h.e.d.AbstractFlushingEventListener  dirty checking collections 130930.556 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG org.hibernate.engine.Collections  Collection found [ltredactedgt.UserOrder.dealOrderSetltdelayed8gt], was [ltunreferencedgt] initialized 130930.558 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG o.h.e.d.AbstractFlushingEventListener  Flushed 5 insertions, 0 updates, 0 deletions to 5 objects 130930.559 [5253145qtp254429331] DEBUG o.h.e.d.AbstractFlushingEventListener  Flushed 1 recreations, 0 updates, 0 removals to 1 collections codepre  pAs you can see, two flush operations occurred.. one about halfway through the log when I reserve and another at the end when I try to save the order bean.

Negative 125 pfirst I must say that as a Python programmer, I might be seeing this problem from a wrong perspective, many years had passed since I wrote my last c code back in college.p  pIm having a bit of a problem, trying to create a hybrid pythonc plugin using firebreath. Ive been succesfull so far integrating all the parts using boostpython.h, but a problem arose when I tried to fire an event from within python. I stumbled with the problem of having to bind together a python function with a c function using the BOOSTPYTHONMODULE. First I tried to bind directly python with my JSAPI derived class fbtestconpythonAPI, the problem with this approach seems to be the lack of reference to the JSAPI object instantiated by the browser, giving me all kinds of signature mismatch problems between python function and c equivalent at execution time. p  pThe only thing that ocurred to me to fix this I agree, is an ugly dirty solution, is to use a global pointer which I initialize by hand with setpluginPointer. This actually works pretty well so far, but I know it is not the right way to do it. I read that I should not be using a raw pointer with a JSAPI object, but Im not sure how to replace it with a sharedptr for this particular implementation. Another problem is the global variable, wich is shared accross all instances, causing for example, that all events are fired on the last tabwindow opened. One way to solve the latter would be creating some sort of array with an index being the current windowthread id, wich is something I should be able to access from both my JSAPI object and pythonc function. p  pOf course Im open, and will apreciate very much, any suggestions, on how to improvefix either this particular workaround or, better, the correct way to communicate boostpython and firebreath without hacking.p  pBelow is the relevant part of the plugin codep  precode Global pointer to plugin instance fbtestconpythonAPI fbtestPtr void fbtestconpythonAPIsetpluginPointerconst stdstringamp val     mtestString  val     fbtestPtr  this Global pointer initialization   void echostdstring x      Firing the echo event on the plugin instance using the global raw pointer     fbtestPtrgtfireechox, 1   BOOSTPYTHONMODULEPointless      defecho, echo   FBvariant fbtestconpythonAPIechoconst FBvariantamp msg     int resultvalue     PyInitialize       try          initPointless  initialize Pointless          PyRunSimpleStringimport Pointless         PyRunSimpleStringPointless.echohello world          object modulehandleltgtborrowedPyImportAddModulemain         object dictionary  module.attrdict      catch erroralreadyset          PyErrPrint           PyFinalize     return 0  codepre

Negative 125 pI am working on a JSF and Hibernate web app with ICEfaces. I am using two Facelets templates, one for the login page and one for the rest of the site.p  pThe problem is, when I click on the login button, it goes to the home page, but without changing the URL nor the template. When I enter the right URL, it goes to it and displays the right template.p  pI know that ICEfaces uses Ajax and partially updates the page, but I want to know how to stop that, I want it to load the entire requested page.p
Negative 125 pIt may sound very silly to people who know this but I am quite new to iOS.

Negative 125 pa hrefhttpconcatenative.orgwikiviewConcatenative20language relnofollowConcatenative languagesa have some very intriguing characteristics, such as being able to compose functions of different arity and being able to factor out any section of a function.  However, many people dismiss them because of their use of postfix notation and how its tough to read.  Plus the Polish probably dont appreciate people using their carefully crafted notation backwards.p  pSo, is it possible to have prefix notation  If it is, what would the tradeoffs be  p  pI have an idea of how it could work, but Im not experienced with concatenative languages so Im probably missing something.  Basically, a function would be evaluated in reverse order and values would be pulled from the stack in reverse order.  To demonstrate this, Ill compare postfix to what prefix would look like.  Here are some concatenative expressions with the traditional postfix notation.p  precode5 dup                               Multiply 5 by itself 3 2                                 Subtract 2 from 3 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 [2 gt] filter length  Get the number of integers from 1 to 5                                      that are greater than 2 codepre  pThe expressions are evaluated from left to right in the first example, code5code is pushed on the stack, then codedupcode duplicates the top value on the stack, then codecode multiplies the top two values on the stack.  Functions pull their last argument first from the stack in the second example, when codecode is called, code2code is at the top of the stack, but it is the last argument.p  pHere is what I think prefix notation would look likep  precode dup 5  3 2 length filter 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 [lt 2] codepre  pThe expressions are evaluated from right to left, and functions pull their first argument first from the stack.  Note how the prefix filter example reads much more closely to its description and looks similar to the applicative style.  One issue I noticed is factoring things out might not be as useful.  For example, in postfix notation you can factor out code2 code from code3 2 code to create a subtractTwo function.  In prefix notation you can factor out code 3code from code 3 2code to create a subtractFromThree function, which doesnt seem as useful.p  pBarring any glaring issues, perhaps a concatenative language that uses prefix notation could win over the people who dislike postfix notation.  Any insight is appreciated.p

Negative 125 pIs there any easy scriptable way to convert a PDF with vector images into a PDF with raster images In other words, I want to generate a PDF with the exact same unrasterized text but with each vector image replaced with a rasterized version.p  pI occasionally read PDFs of technical articles on my Kindle, and have found that reading a PDF directly is frustrating. Thankfully, Amazons a hrefhttpswww.amazon.comgphelpcustomerdisplay.htmlrefhp200767340s2kemailnodeId200767340s2kemailautomatic conversiona of PDFs to the Kindle format does a good job of reflowing the text portions of most of PDFs I have tried. However, while raster images seem to make it through the conversion process fine, vector images get horribly mangled. It would be great if I could easily convert a PDF so that all of its vector images were rasterized.p  pI am interested in any possible solutions, but a Linux or Windowsbased one would be preferable.p

When it subsequently has completed it calls this method in the same controller belowp  precode   public void EmailsCompletedListltEmailErrorgt errors              if errors.Count gt 0                       Do some stuff              Rerender view with updated errors if possible               codepre  pAnyway my question is can I easily rerender the view in this controller once I get the updated list of errors back after the email queue has completed its tasks Alternatively should I wait for the emails to complete before even attempting to render the view initially keep in mind this could be potentially a fairly long drawn out process. Suggestions as always are welcome as MVC is not usually an area Im that keen to delve into.p

Negative 125 pIve read all the posts I could find about this, and none helped. Ive deleted the XAMPP folder from my computer and reinstalled it from the DMG file, which of course fixed the problem, but Id like to know how to fix it in the future. p  pHow it all started I was logged in to phpMyAdmin on my Macbook which runs Mac OS X v10.7.4. I saw the message advising me to change the password of root, which by default has no password. I went to the Manage Privileges tab and changed the password for root on localhosts, webdev and 127.0.0.1. In each case, I typed in the same short password and clicked Generate Password, which created three different hashes. p  pYou know what comes next When I tried to access localhostphpmyadmin again, I was locked out with the message p  precodeError  MySQL said   1045  Access denied for user rootlocalhost using password NO   phpMyAdmin tried to connect to the MySQL server, and the server rejected the connection.  You should check the host, username and password in your configuration and make sure that  they correspond to the information given by the administrator of the MySQL server.  codepre  pSo I looked up stackoverflow, which advised me to set the password for root at the command line. I created a .profile file in my user directory, with export PATHoptlocalbinoptlocalsbinApplicationsxamppxamppfilesbinPATH in it. That enabled me to start a mysql session, but being a noob I couldnt figure out what to do after that.  p  pStackoverflow also advised that I could change the password in config.inc.php. I found this file at phpmyadminsetupframesconfig.inc.php, but the line p  precodecfg[Servers][i][password]   codepre  pwas not in there. I did find that line in phpmyadminlibrariesconfig.default.php, but that file contains dire warnings against editing it. I found another likely file, phpmyadminsetuplibcommon.inc.php, as well as phpmyadminscriptssignon.php, but in all cases, my computer prevented me from making any changes, saying I didnt have permissions. So that was frustrating. p  pIm sure this is a rookie mistake, or several of them, but I was curious to find that none of the things I looked up on stackoverflow helped me. I also wish the Mac OS made it easier to do things like create system files e.g., .profile and edit XAMPP files e.g., common.inc.php. But what can you do. p

Negative 125 pIm using this code to play a WAV file from a resource, and the audio plays correctly, but then I get a short blast of static after it plays about 12 secondp  precodeSystem.Media.SystemSounds.Beep.Play SoundPlayer sndPlayer  new SoundPlayer sndPlayer.Stream  Resources.Notify sndPlayer.Play codepre  pIf I uncomment the codeSystem.Media.SystemSounds.Beep.Playcode line above, then the beep and the Notify sound from my resources both play correctly, and no static.

Also, if I use new codeSoundPlayercWINDOWSMediading.wavcode, it plays correctly from the file.p  pI imagine it has something to do with the codeUnmanagedMemoryStreamcode that codeResources.Notifycode is, and maybe I need to load it in to a managed stream first  I know Ive had issues with PNG files if I dont use codenew BitmapResource.MyPNGcode and try to use codeResource.MyPNGcode directly instead, so maybe something similar with WAV resourcesp  pstrongUpdate strong I originally thought it was happening everytime the sound played, but now it appears it only happens the very first time I play the sound in my app.  So maybe some initialization needs to be donep  pI also tried this, same issuep  precodeSoundPlayer sndPlayer  new SoundPlayerResources.Notify sndPlayer.Play  codepre

Negative 125 pCurrently Im working on a program which will simultaneously take in measurement data from a laser displacement sensor through the serial port and will chart the data live. I have never worked this extensively with IO in c, and even less with handling large data sets in the chart control. p  pRight now Im using a background worker to continuously read data from the serial port and move it into an array, and after each number is read from the port the background worker reports there is a new number available through progress reports. From the reports handeler, I plot this new point on the chart and recalculate the mean, mode, standard deviation, upper and lower control limits, etc. A few other graphs and view ports are updated with the new data as well. This should be able to be done on a continuous basis.p  pfor those of you who are wondering, Im putting all this info down simply because random suggestions from this site have been a big help in the pastp  pNow here is my questionp  pI would like to save the data captured to a text file, but cannot interrupt data capture or plotting to do so. Am i better off to write the data sampled immediately to a text file and only copy the most recent 500 points into an array I could then start a new text file every 10 minutes or so to keep the size limited, then add a time and a date of data capture for later reference. Is there a way to bind a chart to something like a queue, then each time I add a value to the queue it discards the oldest point I need a way to dispose of points in the chart series that are older then 500 samples old since it seems to slow down the chart control as more and more points are added. p  pThis is my first shot at multithreading, so do your best to not jump down my throat if ive done something terribly wrong. p  pThanks in advance for all of your suggestions Any guidance would be appreciated. p

Negative 125 pI have a qkdb database where one of the columns has times. I want to take the data in each row, and send it out with tibco rendezvous at the time specified in the time column of each row. What would be the best way to do thisp  pIt seems possible using the java timer and delay classes, or maybe with some third party stuff. Note the complex part here is that Im not sending out at a regular interval, i need to go to database to determine the time at which each message is sent.p  pSo for example if the first two values in the column are 140000.000 143000.000 then the first message will be sent out at 2pm and the second will be sent out at 230pm. p  pThanksp

Negative 125 pI have a Core Data Entity that receives periodic updates from a web service. When this Core Data Entity changes its content, I would like a delegate method to be called on one of my View Controller Classes. This is so I am able to update the appropriate data on that view controller. How would I go about doing this.p  pThis is similar to the NSFetchedResultsController that sends a delegate message to the Table View when the Core Data contents are changed but I do not wish to use the NSFetchedResults Controller in this case.p  pThanksp

To do this I wrote a very simple handler that does a SELECT and an INSERT, when I benchmarked it on 300 concurrent requests 10,000 in total the results were quite poor 1900ms average.p  pThe performance target weve been given by the client is based on another app they use written in PHP, so I wrote a quick PHP script that does functionally the same thing as my simple modperl test handler and it gave a 400ms averagep  pThe PHP code isp  precodecs  oracle.ourdomain.com1521XE oc  ocipconnecthr,password,cs ifoc  print ocierror  stid  ociparseoc, SELECT id FROM zzsystemoptions WHERE id  1 ociexecutestid stmt  ociparseoc, INSERT INTO zzsystemoptions id,optionname VALUES zzsystemoptionsids.nextval,load testing ociexecutestmt echo hello world codepre  pThe Perl code isp  precodeuse strict use Apache2RequestRec  use Apache2RequestIO   use Apache2Const compile gt qwcommon use DBI our dbh sub handler      my r  shift       Connect to DB     dbh  DBIgtconnect DBIOraclehostoracle.ourdoamin.comport1521sidXE, hr, password  unless dbh       my dbiqueryobject  dbhgtprepareSELECT id FROM zzsystemoptions     dbiqueryobjectgtexecute     dbiqueryobject        dbhgtprepareINSERT INTO zzsystemoptions id,optionname VALUES zzsystemoptionsids.nextval,     dbiqueryobjectgtexecuteload testing      Print out some info about this...     rgtcontenttypetextplain     rgtprintErrors errn     return Apache2ConstOK  codepre  pThe modperl has a startup.pl script called with a PerlRequire in the apache config that loads all the used modules.

Negative 125 pRelated but not quite the same thinga hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1125004whichismoreefficientmultiplemysqltablesoronelargetablewhich is more effcienta or at least reading through it didnt help me anyp  pSo I am working on a new site selling insurance policies we already have several sites up its a rails application that do this so I have a table in my sql database called policies. As you can imagine it has lots of columns to support all the different options available.p  pWhile working on this new site I realized I needed to keep track of 20 more options. p  pMy concern is that the policies table is already large, but the columns in it right now are almost all used by every application we have. Whereas if I add these they would only be used for the new site and would leave tons of null cells on all the rest of the policies.p  pSo my question is do I add those to the existing table or create a new table just for the policies sold on that site Also I believe that if I created a new table I could leave out some of the columns but not very many from the main policies table because they are not needed for this application.  p

Negative 125 pIn my canonical example, I have two tabs the first with a button and the second with a text box that is bound to a validation rule. When the button is clicked an action occurs that should cause the validation to fail and therefore the Validation.Error event to fire.

Negative 125 pIve recently been watching some screencasts in order to get a feel for the javascript programmer perspective and coding process, and have been a little frustrated, especially coming from a ruby background, seeing all of this stuff done by hand, and with such odd naming conventionsp  pSo there is CoffeeScript, which Im looking at with a fair amount of interest. Then there is RJS, but then Rails 3 has pulled support for that and I dont want to learn an outdated method. Then there is Go, which Im not sure has enough support yet and just dont know enough about yet. Then of course all along here most of the time here theres jquery.p  pBut should I even use jquery Can I get around writing javascript entirely Wouldcould the circumvention attempt be fruitful Im not asking for a therapy session or a bashing session, so if youre wound up like that please dont post here. Im actually intrigued by javascript. If only because all of the cool programmers are talking about functional languages now.p  pBut I dont want to waste my time. And all I really need to have is a robust way for passing information from railsactiverecord to the javascript in a variety of ways. And I need to know what Im doing with javascript. In fact thats mainly all I need to do. I need to be able to look at javascript, or coffeescript, or go, or whatever, and see it like I see ruby, which looks like an orchestra if its written right.p  pSo my questions are these a. It seems like a lot of javascript tutorials are produced by javascript programmers who dont know what exactly it is they are doing. What are some good tutorials that involve a developer going over code, thinking aloud CORRECTLY about Javascript Also railsjavascript materials. Sorely lacking. There is not a single book out on Rails 3  Javascript, which is crazy because so much has changed since 2006s Ajax on Rails. What resources do you know of other than lots of time  b. RJS, Coffeescript, etc v. Javascript  Jquery or alt. What are the weaknesses of using the higherlevel abstracted languages and what are the benefits. And most importantly for me, a rails user, strongwhat is the solution that is most likely to be compatible with rails 2 years from nowstrong RJS sounded like a great idea. But it used prototype right Is there an RJS which is Rails 3 readyp  p And, again, guys, the book issue. Seriously this is a nice little opportunity for a knowledgable railsjavascript developer. Nothing has been released by the major publishers explicitly on Rails and Javascript since 2006 That is just astonishing.p

Negative 125 pDoes Android store all of its system settings in a single file Is it possible to access this file and possibly copy it to an SD card.

I am unsure how to tackle the process for a user to create a subsite during the registration process andor what path to take. p  pLets say the main site is www.abc.net  the user would then register a subsite based on the credentials they input. E.g. user1.abc.net, mysite.abc.net or joeblog.abc.net...  whatever they want and so forth. No SEO required  The site templates are fairly basic and the subsites will be accessible through the main site. So the process to bep  ol liUser logs onto main site and registersli liDuring registration, user enters details including subsite name they want li liSelect the template they want  basically different colour schemes. Functionality to be the same for all templatesli litheir site is created li liwhen the user is logged on they get directed to their subsite li liAbility to edit their subsite  add content and add extra pages, change details. etcli liGeneral users registered or anonymous would be able to browse and search content to the subsites via the main site.li ol  pEach subsite to be independent from each other  no content sharing. Basically they are separate websites hosted as subsites but need they need some type of editing available like a CMS. Not sure if a shared CMS is possible but the owner has to be able to modify content to their own subsite.p  pSo my question are p  pDo I try and use a DrupalWordpressJoomla CMS with multisite functionalityp  pDo I try a solution where I have a collection of simple sites that I use for subsites, each to have their own database and some type of CMS or WYSIWYG for editing Is separate CMS even possible for each Subsitep  pAny input would be greatly appreciated.p

When a survey is created, all codequestionidcodes where codeenabled  1code are imploded into a string and stored in a separate codesurveycode table. In the future when questions are edited, the system will simply disable the old question and add the new version to the end of the table and update everything with the proper value for codeordercode, thus allowing old surveys to still be viewed in their original state.p  pI am struggling to figure out how to best handle the ordering aspect of this. I can easily display the output data if I have a string stored in the database for the codequestionidcodes for example, my string would be code2,3,5,6,9,4,1codeI could use codeexplodecode and then iterate through the default 0index of that array, calling each question in turn. How can I store the values in the proper orderp

Negative 125 pIm new to Google App Engine and am trying to port my Django application to use that. I havent been able to find too much on this and dont think multitenancy is what Im looking for seems to be for more or less identical apps with different data sources, but my scenario is thisp  pI have multiple domains and currently have different settings file with seperate WSGI files which works great for my current Apache configuration, but Im trying to migrate over to GAE and cant seem to figure out how to do something similiar based on domain name Really, all I critically need is a seperate urls file based on the domain name datastore is the same on both, although it would be ideal to have a separate settings file so I dont have to load unused apps, preprocessors, etc on sites that dont need them.p

Negative 125 pIm very new to unix programming, so please bear with me.  p  pId like to pass data between two processes.  I was going to use named pipes, but read about these halfduplex pipes, and it was very intriguing, so I figured that I would give them a try first.p  pI have two issues with these pipes thus farp  ol liI havent figured out how to get execlp to run another application from my child processli liEven if I could, debugging is tough because Ive only been able to set breakpoints in the parent processli ol  pIm sure there are reasons for these issues.  I am starting to wonder if it makes sense to just forget about them and just use named pipes so I can debug each application in a separate instance of eclipse.p  pIf there is any relevant information, please let me know.  The code I am using is essentially what it found on a hrefhttpwww.tldp.orgLDPlpgnode11.html relnofollowtldp.orga.p  pEDIT  I renamed my question to be about unix pipes in general.  I had assumed that for named pipes, I wouldnt have to use fork, but all of the examples I have seen so far require it.  So regardless of halfduplex or named pipes, Im going to need to be able to debug the child process somehowp  pEDIT 2  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2784500howtosendasimplestringbetweentwoprogramsusingpipesthis examplea clearly shows that what I had seen before on an IBM link regarding named pipes wasnt necessarily true.p

Negative 125 pI have been reading this article a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFunctionpointerhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFunctionpointera and am sort of confused. Since CC support function pointers, doesnt that mean they support functional programming in general Note that I dont actually want to use C or C for functional programming, but Im curious since I have never heard that C or C supports such a thing. I know that compilers for many functional programming languages exist in C, but that is not what I really mean by support.p

Negative 125 pIm currently using cvCreateImage with IplImages to store my edge maps in my code. These are generated with a Canny edge detection and the resulting map either has pixels on or off. From these I perform some Hough transformations whose thresholds are set depending on the number of edge pixels in the image to begin with. So I sum the intensity of all the pixels in an image. However, the lowest IplImage type appears to have a depth of 8 bits. Obviously, its not hard to make the simple changes in the math to account for this, but it seems like an unnecessary step. Is there a builtin way to create an IplImage or Mat with 1 bit depth per pixel Thank you muchp

Negative 125 pRecently, I have delved into the world of C from Java. With Java, things were so much more simple, because there was pretty much the one official compiler that everyone used.p  pWith C though, it seems like there are trillions of options. The most obvious selection seemed to be Microsoft compiler, as it comes with a great ide.p  pBut I would like to develop cross platform I do most of my work on windows, though, and I wasnt sure if later compiling the same program on a different compiler would turn into a nightmare.p  pSo then I looked MinGW, a port of the GCC compiler collection to windows, witch seems like it would make switching to Linux development easier.p  pBut then I heard about the MinGWw64 project. It seems to be under more active development, and has the advantage over MinGW of being able to generate 64 bit executables.p  pMy main problem with MinGWw64 is that it really confuses me. looking at the downloads, there are tons of options, like headers and CRT sourcesp  pWhen I went to the directory, Toolchains targetting Win3264, and then under Automated Builds, it seems there latest MinGW version is from 2011 mingww32bini686mingw20111219 in the case of Win32 I thought that MinGWw64 was under active developmentp  pAnyway, I would very much appreciate it if somebody could enlighten me as the the pros and cons of todays c compilers. Things that are important to me are being able to use arep  ul lipstrongportable codestrong not really sure how big of an issue this ispli lipstrongperformancestrong of end product, and the compiling  c is much slower than Java at compilingpli lipstrongease of usestrong  I am rather new to c, .dlls, and native programming in general, coming from Java.

Also, with c11 being implemented, support for that and future standards is importantpli lipstrongpricestrong  I dont want to spend a ton of money on a compiler right off the bat. Free is preferable. If there were very good reasons for spending money on a certain compiler though, I could see doing so in the future.pli ul  pSorry for my noobiness and the length of the question. This has been confusing me and halting my progress from the very day I picked up my first c book, after coding in Java for a long time.

Negative 125 pI have a basic particle system in JavaScript utilising canvas for rendering, and Im trying to find the best way to handle collisions between particles. The particle system can handle about 70,000 particles at a pretty decent FPS.p  pIt consists of an array that contains every Particle object. Each Particle object contains 3 Vector objects one for displacement, velocity, and acceleration which contain an x and a y variable. Before each frame, acceleration vectors are applied to velocity vectors, and velocity vectors are applied to displacement vectors for every single Particle object. The renderer then iterates through each Particle and then draws a 1x1 pixel square at the location of every displacement vector.p  pThe particle system also has magnetic fields also, which can cause the particles to accelerate towardsaway from a given point.p  pI tried applying a magnetic field to each particle, but the calculations I use to get the updated acceleration vectors for each particle are too inefficient, and this method reduced the FPS considerably.p  pBelow is the code I use to recalculate Particle acceleration vectors, with respect to nearby magnetic fields This function is called before every framep  precodeParticle.prototype.submitToFields  function fields       our starting acceleration this frame     var totalAccelerationX  0     var totalAccelerationY  0       for each passed field     for var i  0 i lt fields.length i          var field  fields[i]           find the distance between the particle and the field         var vectorX  field.point.x  this.point.x         var vectorY  field.point.y  this.point.y           calculate the force via MAGIC and HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE         var force  field.mass  Math.powvectorXvectorXvectorYvectorY,1.5           add to the total acceleration the force adjusted by distance         totalAccelerationX  vectorX  force         totalAccelerationY  vectorY  force            update our particles acceleration     this.acceleration  new VectortotalAccelerationX, totalAccelerationY  codepre  pIts obvious why the above method reduced the performance drastically  the number of calculations rises exponentially with every new particle added.p  pIs there another method of particle collision detection that will have good performance with thousands of particles Will these methods work with my current object structurep

Negative 125 pIve been facing an intermittent issue with automapper across a couple of different projects.p  p99.9 of the time, mapping on nullable bools works properly.  However, intermittently, at some point it starts incorrectly mapping false and null values for sure, and on even rarer occasion I have seen it map false to true.p  pFor a long time I thought it might be in my head, but today it was verified while demonstrating a new piece of functionality to my coworker.  Consistently, it was mapping null to false, and false to null.  Once it starts, it will happen with every nullable bool, as far as I can tell.  p  pThe odd thing is that it will stop doing this as soon as I rebuild the project.p  pOn one project, we believe that the problem was solved by writing a small function that just took in the source values and gave the obvious values back, but that was on mapping from a nullable bool to a nonnullable bool.  But today, it happened from a nullable bool to a nullable bool.p  pAnd I have not one idea how to debug this.  I cant get it to reproduce with any degree of predictability, and have gone so far as to write a selenium test that ran 3000 times to attempt to trip it off, to no avail.p  pI have a trace.axd from the request from earlier today, if that might help out.p  pCan anyone give me suggestions  We use C, Visual Studio, IIS, AutoMapper, and .Net MVC and Entity Framework.p  pAt this point, Im so flustered that I dont know what other information I can give.  Im on the high end of junior developer myself, but it was verified by a senior developer on my team today.  Feels nice to know Im not seeing things.p

Negative 125 pAre there any security concerns in choosing to hash a user password at the application level in ASP.NET vs at the database level in SQL CLR Im seen it done both ways.p  pMy thinking is that in the application level, the password is only sent once from the browser to the webserver. In a database implementation, the password is sent a second time to the database for hashing. p  pIn the latter case, someone running SQL Server Profiler would be able to see the password sent to the procedure or function in plaintext. Im not too familiar with SQL Server Auditing, but if it had the ability to capture similar information it would pose a risk as well.p

Negative 125 pSo, I want my app to create a Service that will initially run in the background and do some stuff. This background process will never stop. It will constantly keep running. The ONLY way the background process can be created or destroyed would be through the app. I understand that there are endless possibilities to kill a process. I guess I want my app to be able to tell me whether or not the process is running and retrieve real time information from that process. Along with that, be able to start andor destroy the background process.p  pSo, lets say that you were to open the app and startcreate the service. Even when you closeterminalcall onDestroy for the app, I still want the background process to be running. The only way to destroy this service would be to reopenrecreate the app, and destroy it.p  pDoes Android allow something like this Is there a way to get around thisp  pI was going to create a codeIntentServicecode and make it run an infinite loop. Though, my only problem is how to obtain information from the codeIntentServicecode. From what Ive learned, an codeIntentServicecode is created and kills itself when its done.p  pIm still new to Android, so dont hesitate to be specific andor remedial.p

Negative 125 pI have spent quite a bit of time researching the different Python frameworks for neo4j i.e. neo4django, bulbflow, py2neo, and have been very impressed at how they are able to abstract the functionality to make it feel like working with familiar relational databases.  The question I have is around setting up a stack that allows for some of this abstraction for things like model creation, oauth, and basic querying but to incorporate graphbased algorithms for data analysis, more detailed traversals and path finding, etc.p  pIs there a recommended or tried approach for creating a robust RESTful API with the available libraries and capabilities of Django, and the freedom to drop down to the lower level neo4j API when necessary  Having some control over the cypher queries would be great, but I dont want to reinvent the wheel if something like neo4django has already implemented the basics very well.  It is a bit daunting deciding how to set this all up from scratch, and there seem to be a lot of possibilities, so any advice is greatly appreciated.p  pFor example, since py2neo is built on top of the neo4j REST API, and I then use it to work with Django and Tastypie as a separate REST API, which is accessed by a mobile or web app, do these layers of abstraction get redundant or even start to take away from the usefulness  Again, any input from people who have worked with graph databases and python is definitely helpful.p  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrong I would also really like to take advantage of some of the neo4j libraries out there, such as spatial, so the extra abstraction in some of the existing solutions may be counterproductive  again, Im not sure thoughp

A simple formula to run over all ISBN fields would be great. 2 I need to compare data between 1 spreadsheet with 11,000 books in it current library stock, a second with  up to 1000 books in it currently on order and finally the third currently active one about to be ordered with 50 to 200 books listed in it.p  pAll spreadsheets use the same column configuration as belowp  pLibrary ordersbr Title   Author  Publisher   ISBN long version US UKgpd   HK Other          PO no. Date ordered UNNATURAL SELECTION MARA HVISTENDAHL    Public Affairs Publishing Reprint edition May 1, 2012    978610391511                                    p  pFinally, the out put of these comparisons should quickly and easily identify on what lines we have matches. and what type of match it is, Author only, Author and Title, or Author, title and ISBN etc for all the possible combinations.  To make this easier assume spreadsheet 1 is an unalterable master table, with spreadsheet two similar. It is really only on Spreadsheet 3 we need to be clear if we are starting to reorder materials.p  pIf it is possible to have these as different sheets in a workbook it would be ideal.  The only additional feature is that any scripts that run need to be able to cope with spreadsheet 1 increasing in size as new acquisitions arrive and are included. Both spreadsheets 2 and 3 will vary increase and decrease as the ordering process proceeds.  p  pFinally the absolute ideal would be for this comparison process to be instant live and ongoing as data is included.p  pIf anyone would like to take this on 3 Library staff will be eternally grateful.p  pregards Nick p

Negative 125 pI am trying to make a simple Arduino game that keeps track of the number of times a button has been pressed. There are two buttons, one for each user, and whoever is closest to the random number that the Arduino picks, wins. winning being a light comes on next to the winers button. However I am stuck in what seems to be a rutbefore I go further, I will divulge that I am just barely two weeks old into the whole arduinoC environment so my knowledge is pretty low. p  pBasically what I want to happen is that the game lasts a certain amount of time, lets say 5 seconds, then after the five seconds, all the button pushes are tallied and compared and a winner is picked. Then the game resets itself and we can play again. Where I am getting stuck at is in the timing function. I originally was subtracting a codegameClockcode variable from the codemilliscode function however I have read that it is bad practice to reset the codemilliscode function. Perhaps my code will give you a better understanding of what I am trying to accomplish. p  precodeinclude ltBounce.hgt   Using Arduino UNO   define RBUTTON 2   define RRLED 3   define RGLED 4   define MBLED 5     define LGLED 6   define RLLED 7   define LBUTTON 8    Bounce BounceR  BounceRBUTTON, 5   Bounce BounceL  BounceLBUTTON, 5    int lastStateR  0   int lastStateL  0   int switchLCount  0   int switchRCount  0   long gameClock  5000    void setup                  LED from left to right     pinModeRBUTTON, INPUT     pinModeRRLED, OUTPUT Red     pinModeRGLED, OUTPUT Green     pinModeMBLED, OUTPUT Blue     pinModeLGLED, OUTPUT Green     pinModeRLLED, OUTPUT Red     pinModeLBUTTON, INPUT     Serial.begin9600        void loop      BounceR.update     BounceL.update     int total  switchRCount  switchLCount        int valueR  BounceR.read     int valueL  BounceL.read   if valueL  lastStateL    if valueL  HIGH               switchLCount       Serial.printLeft button       Serial.printlnswitchLCount       Serial.printTotal        Serial.printlntotal                 lastStateL  valueL  if valueR  lastStateR    if valueR  HIGH        switchRCount       Serial.printRight button        Serial.printlnswitchRCount       Serial.printTotal        Serial.printlntotal           lastStateR  valueR     codepre

Negative 125 pThese days I am working on a new application that will be written in java and it will call native dlls functions via JNI. The main purpose of the application is to receive data from the internet and save it to temporary class objects. Later, when the number of created objects reaches 200, it should convert the data to c structs and pass an array of struct pointers to native dll function. Native function will perform some calculation and return a new array of structs results. These structs will have to be converted to java objects and passed to java side. I have to note that rewriting native code functionality in java is not an option.p  pPerformance is very important and that is the reason why I chose to use JNI. I have read many posts and came to the conclusion that in order to get a good performance, I will have to minimize the number of calls to JNI layer, and a preferable way will be to pass the data in one batch.p  pWhat do you think is the best way to perform this task Should I serialize the data to byte array, pass it to the native side and deserialize it to c structs Are there any other efficient solutionsp  pThank you very much for your help.p

Negative 125 pI have a question regarding displaying different content on different web browsing device.  I know with CSS i can display different style sheet according to browser width size.  But the challenge I have now is Flash content, I am setting up a Flash content for my company website and as we all know flash isnt supported in mobile device.  To resolve this I thought about making a simple HTML version of the website for mobile devices.  However, what can I use to determine when to load the flash or when to load the html  For example if I were to visit the site through my desktop the FLASH website will load and if i were to use my phone to visit the site, the HTML website will load. I am pretty new into web designing so any kind of help will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks alot in advancep

Negative 125 pOK, so I had a website project I was running locally on my computer using MAMP. Long story short, the computer is out for repairs and I need to figure out how to move the project from my backup disk to an online webserver ASAP. Thats easily done for the HTML, PHP, CSS and JS files, but moving over the MySQL data files is more of a puzzle for me. I was able to find the .MYD, .MYI and .frm files, and when I copied them to the server I created a new database before copying over the files it seemed to work at first. I see all the tables and data in phpMyAdmin. Then I ran into this oddity whenever I do a global database search in PMA, PMA attempts to search a nonexistent table, causing MySQL to bark.p  precodeSHOW FULL FIELDS FROM  wpai1eclogging FROM  foobar  1146  Table foobar.wpai1eclogging doesnt exist  codepre  pI tried searching the informationschema to see if something was out of syncp  precodeSELECT  FROM  informationschema.TABLES WHERE  TABLENAME LIKE  wpai1eclogging codepre  pbut I came up with nothing. So I went back to the data files and found this curious fact there was a wpai1eclogging.frm file, but no corresponding wpai1eclogging.MYD or wpai1eclogging.MYI files. What could this mean I dont know what these file types mean, but it seems like every table has a .frm, .MYD and .MYI file EXCEPT this table for some reason. I had these files backed up to my Time Capsule using Time Machine I had to connect it to another Mac to restore the files, so my guess is either the last backup went wrong or more likely I made some mistake in restoring the files. Ive never had to restore Time Capsule files to another Mac and I found it to be WAY more tricky than restoring files to my own computer, so Im allowing for the possibility that I did it wrong somehow. But assuming the backup was correct and I restored correctly, what else could explain thisp  pAnd in case you need to know, this project uses WordPress with Timelys All in One Event Calendar plugin a hrefhttptime.ly relnofollowhttptime.lya, so thats what ai1ec means. Im not sure if this table is critical to the current version of the plugin or I should just remove that .frm file and forget about it.p

However, when i use that token to instantiate the FacebookClient objectp  precodeFacebookClient facebookClient  new DefaultFacebookClientaccessToken codepre  pIt fails with the following messagep  blockquote   pException in thread main com.restfb.exception.FacebookOAuthException Received Facebook error response of type OAuthException 200 The user hasnt authorized the application to perform this action code 200, subcode nullp blockquote  pIf I go to the graph explorer and manually get an access token, then use that in my code, everything works fine.  p  pIm sure theres something subtle Im missing and any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pMany thanksp
Negative 125 pI have my Java code working in Eclipse but I need to add a few functionnality.p  pFirst, how to limit the number of digits that can be entered by the user  Actually I have a JPasswordField that let a person enter a pin Code, and I would like this JPasswordField limited to 4 digits maximum.

Negative 125 pI have the following problem. Im developing an application that uses a file appender for all loggers log4j version 1.2. Everything works ok, but now i need to log to different files based on some runtime parameters. p  pAs a restriction, i need also to restrict the amount of log4j.xml configuration info, because i dont know beforehand how many values will this parameters take, and for that reason i cant configure different appenders FileAppenders that point to different files in the log4j configuration file. I also need to restrict the amount of new code added, for example, it may be ok to pass the runtime parameter as part of the logger name LoggerFactory.getLoggerruntimeParameter  getClass, etc but i wouldnt like to create a new FileAppender by code and then adding that new Appender to the recently created logger as a side question, will this alternative work.p  pI think that perhaps creating a new appender that open different files based on his provided name based on the runtime parameter will work, but i dont know how to do that, and i dont know how it will behave when executed concurrently as it will be a single appender for all loggers.p  pThank you and excuse my englishp

Negative 125 pI am currently using Xamarin.Auth on a iOS project to handle some user authentication via Facebook and Twitter in my application. The Facebook authentication using OAuth2Authenticator works great and my implementation was based mainly off the docs a hrefhttpcomponents.xamarin.comgettingstartedxamarin.auth relnofollowhttpcomponents.xamarin.comgettingstartedxamarin.autha. Twitter however still uses OAuth1 it seems and thus I based my implementation mainly off the answer in this StackOverflow questions a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma21982205httpstackoverflow.coma21982205a. Everything works properly and I am able to retrieve user, tweets, etc. but after all the code executes I receive a Authentication Error popup on the screen saying Object reference not set to an instance of an object. there is nothing printed to the console however as is the case with most normal errors I have seen thus far.

Negative 125 pI have a table with a field called codevatfreecode. So my model was created with a property codevatfreecode. Its value can be strong0strong or strong1strong.p  pI want my view to show strongNostrong or strongYesstrong, instead of strong0strong or strong1strong.

Thanks.p  precodethis is the total size of the file int totalSize  urlConnection.getContentLength variable to store total downloaded bytes int downloadedSize  0  create a buffer... byte[] buffer  new byte[1024] int bufferLength  0 used to store a temporary size of the buffer  now, read through the input buffer and write the contents to the file while  bufferLength  inputStream.readbuffer gt 0       add the data in the buffer to the file in the file output stream the file on the sd card     fileOutput.writebuffer, 0, bufferLength     add up the size so we know how much is downloaded     downloadedSize  bufferLength     this is where you would do something to report the prgress, like this maybe     updateProgressdownloadedSize, totalSize     Log.w DOWNLOAD , progress   downloadedSize      totalSize codepre  pI noticed that the codetotalSizecode is code1code when calling codegetContentLengthcode...probably because of the missing content length from the header.p
Negative 125 pIm trying a use a nonreturning envelope i.e. the segments in it do not return to 0. Im finding that the envelope codeenvcode cannot be triggered more than once in the following codep  precode SynthDefstupidSynth,              ttrig         var env, envShape, audio, env2         envShape  Env.new[0, 1], [0.5], sine         env  EnvGen.krenvShape, ttrig         env2  EnvGen.krEnv.perc, ttrig         audio  SinOsc.ar400  env  100  env2  0.1         Out.ar0, audio      .add    p  Pmono[     stupidSynth,     ttrig, 1 ] .play  codepre  pWhat I was hoping for was that whenever the synth is retriggered, the pitch would get higher and higher. What actually happens is that the first note plays the pitch envelope, and each subsequent note is just at the final i.e. high frequency. codeenvcode is clearly not being retriggered.p  pIm not sure why this would be. Envelopes dont have to have returned to 0 before they can be retriggered  its perfectly possible to retrigger an envelope before its finished. Theres something about my envelope that isnt working.p  pIm basically looking for something with the behaviour of codeLinecode, but also able to be retriggered and have a customisable curve.p  pIs what Im trying to do possiblep

Negative 125 pI am currently having lots of difficulty in one of my assignments. The task for this assignment is to create an aviation radar, VOR, with javas GUI features. When the user presses either the leftright arrow on their keyboard, the circular radar should rotate, and a needle in the middle of the radar should move leftright.  I am very close to finishing, but I am stuck on one part. I drew an image of the radar, and I attempted to draw a line on top of it. However, I was only successful when I was able to make all JPanels transparent. This causes a problem because it is difficult to see what I drew on top of it.  So, my question is, how would I draw it on top of the radar image without making everything transparent Below is my codep  precodepublic class finalVORGUI extends JPanel     private JPanel

Negative 125 pIm implementing an app, which is generating hundreds of thousands rows in 4 threads. Each thread opens a separate connection to cassandra.p  pEvery item of the table has a unique hash identifier String, but the primary key is an uuid.p  pThe process of the item persisting is the followingp  p1 The item is created and its hash is computed.  2 Then a lookup for the hash is being executed in a second table, which pairs hashes accordingly to the items uuids. 3 If a hash  uuid pair is found, a lookup for the items uuid is being executed 1st table again and since the item has to exist because a hash  uuid pair was found, the item is loaded from cassandra to JPA and its updated afterwards. When no hash  uuid pair is found, a new item is created in the corresponding table and a new hash  uuid pair is saved as well.p  pThe data generation has two steps. The first step is running with empty tables and generates the first datasets. No errors happen there, because in the step nr. 3, a hash  uuid pair is never found, so no updates occur.p  pIn the second step, the whole algorithm runs again, but already on populated data tables. In this step, random errors occur while reading the data items byt their correspnding uuids primary keys  sometimes the server doesnt retun complete text data proper JSON strings are stored in the table, but incomplete JSON strings are retrieved into the application.p  pIm completely sure, that my algorithm is correct, because the same algorithem worked with hibernate and mysql, even with postgresql but since I need faster writes, Im playing around with cassandra.p  pI am using a macbook pro with 16 GB RAM, for the work with cassandra I use the Kundera library supports JPA. As for cassandra, I have tried the datastax 2.0.4 version, and also the 2.0.7 version downloaded directly from the Apache site. There is no cluster, only one instance is running locally on my machine, on an external SSD drive. Kundera is using CQL v3.p  pHas anybody an idea, how this behaviour could occur Is there a bug in the datastax cassandra driver or in Kundera Or am I using cassandra wrong and the database shouldnt be used this way Or are there any configuration tweaks which I might have forgottenp  pThe only thing I have changed in the cassandra configuration file are all the timeouts, because I was getting too many TimeoutExceptions with the default values the timeouts occured during primary key lookupsp

For examplep  pstrongmain1.pystrongp  precodeimport project1.modules.helper1 codepre  pBut I want to copy the contents of project1 to another location, and use that copy for development and testing.  Because everything is absolute, and because admin is on PYTHONPATH, my copied version is still going to be referencing the live code.  I could add my new location to PYTHONPATH, and change the names of all files by hand i.e. add dev to the end of everything, do my changeswork, then when Im ready to go live, once again, by hand, remove dev from everything.  This, will work, but is a huge hassle and prone to error.p  pSurely there must be some better way of handling live and development versions of a Python project.p

Negative 125 pIm having an issue where the sourcemaps generated by Webpack using the codeinlinesourcemapcode configuration setting are off by one line when I use the Chrome devtools debugger. Webpack is set up inside a Ruby on Rails application to generate a concatenated, unminified JavaScript file composed of a couple dozen modules.  Most of those modules are ReactJS components, and are parsed by the codejsxcode loader.  The output from Webpack is then included in the codeapplication.jscode file along with some other JavaScript libraries generated by gems.p  pWhen I use codeevalsourcemapcode, there is no problem.  Something about the use of codeinlinesourcemapcode causes the line numbers to be thrown off by one.p  pInspecting JavaScript that is not a React component still has this issue, so I dont think its related to the use of jsx.p

Negative 125 pIm looking for a way to recursively expand tree nodes. The tree has NOT been loaded to its fullest. We only load one level of depth every time. So if my path has 3 levels of depth I want to load the first, then get the nodeID of the level 2 node I want to expand and expand it, then get the 3rd etc. However when a node is expanded there is an AJAX call from the proxy to fetch the data of the nodes childs. Since this call is asynchronous the program itself tries to move forward with expanding the next level node. However this one hasnt been loaded yet due to ajax delay and I get a node undefined error.

Negative 125 pMy app currently downloads data from a web service.

Based on Apples recommendation, I have included the save file logic in the ApplicationDidEnterBackground method of the app delegate. p  pHowever, I am having problems ensuring the data is not mutated before the save to file system is called because the background thread pause is not called immediately.p  pFor example, a refresh of client data is kicked off and returns 2000 records simple data scheme.  However, while this is running, the user presses the Home button and the App goes into the background and attempts to save the data to file system.  p  pWithin the block processing of the background thread, I have included logic to log when clients are added to the array, as well as included NSLog messages to tell me when the ApplicationDidEnterBackground method is called.

Negative 125 pIm using Java 1.7. I have a class codeItemFactorycode inside a .jar that allows other developers to create Item objects item has a private constructor. The factory requires some user input to create certain items. Recently I added some items which also require input, but all the necessary data is already present in the system. I thought it would be esier for developers to let my codeItemHandlercode class automatically create these items. So instead having them type thisp  precodeItemFactory factory  new ItemFactory Item item  factory.createItemparameter1, parameter2 ItemHandler handler  new ItemHandler handler.doSomethingCoolitem codepre  pThey could simply do thisp  precodehandler.doSomethingCool codepre  pand the codedoSomethingCoolcode method will make the item automatically from the factory because all necessary input is already present in the system.p  pMy problem is now that the facotry class suddenly has public methods that should not be visible. For example, the public method createItemForSomethingCoolPurposes, is automatically invoked by the system itself and developers needed worry about it. Its potentially confusing for them to see this method because its not clear what its purpose is. Adding commentsdocumentation to express this method should not be called seems stupid. Am I wrong on this Is this a common problem, and are there conventions about it p

Negative 125 pIm trying to create my own framework for iOS and I am encountering many problems. I followed Ray Wenderlichs tutorial herep  pa hrefhttpwww.raywenderlich.com65964createaframeworkforios relnofollowhttpwww.raywenderlich.com65964createaframeworkforiosap  pAnd successfully created my framework. I dragged it into one of my apps and tried to start using it. Before I got very far I was being complained at by the compiler that there was an Apple MachO Linker Error due to a global variable declared with extern in one of the header files of my framework being referenced by one of the classes of my framework. Though this was annoying the particular global variable in question was not necessary in that situation, so I removed the reference to it from the file that was being complained about. I deleted my framework from my app, rebuilt the aggregate target that Ray Wenderlich told me to create and then readded the framework to my app. After attempting to run my app anew with the revised framework I was shocked to find that I was getting the same error. This makes no sense to me because I deleted the problem variable from the problem file, but it still thinks that that class is referencing that variable. After trying every possible combination of cleaning and rebuilding things, I have inferred that somewhere the very first iteration of my framework is still stored in my app. I cannot find it to replace it. If anyone could help me figure out the best way to cleanly make an edit to my framework and add the new framework to my app I would be very grateful.p

Negative 125 pUp until this point, Ive been using Spring in a development mode of sorts with hbmddl2 properties which drop all the tables and start again when I deploy the application to glassfish. It works well as a development config, since I know exactly what my database is going to contain when I run my app.p  pHowever, this isnt appropriate for an application with a rolling release cycle and Im not exactly sure how to proceed in changing it so it would be suitable in a production environment. Googling it just gives me resources on how to update Spring or Hibernate itself, but nothing on maintaining a server. Im getting the feeling Im going to have to start creating XML object property mappings for Hibernate, but I think thats a little over the top when all I want to do is update a schema with new tables and new columns with default values.p  pThanks in advance for any answers, Im completely stuck on this.p

Negative 125 pInstalling codenumpycode  codepandascode via setuptools as dependency in setup.py does not work for me. It is not about missing dependencies. If I install numpy via codepip install numpycode and afterwards codepython setup.py developcode everything works fine. If I understand the codesetuptoolscode documentation right, all packages are build first and then installed. So codenumpycode is build, but not installed when codepandascode is build.p  pAs a workaround I added codenumpycode to my codesetuprequirescode. That works fine, but is obviously not a very clean solution.p  pDoes anybody know a clean solution Linux only is fine for installing numpy  pandas via setuptoolsp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pThe dependency is configure viap  precodeinstallrequires[numpy,pandas] codepre  pIt does not make a difference, whether I add numpy explicitly or just add pandas. In both cases numpy will be downloaded and build, but pandas fails to build because some headers which probably are installed during the install step of numpy, but not while building cannot be found. If I install numpy first, everything works fine. I can reproduce this 100 and independent of the project Im working on.p  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pThis is the end of the stack tracep  precode  File tmpeasyinstallQMa4cepandas0.14.1tempeasyinstallf6lreInumpy1.9.0numpydistutilscommandbuildsrc.py, line 153, in run   File tmpeasyinstallQMa4cepandas0.14.1tempeasyinstallf6lreInumpy1.9.0numpydistutilscommandbuildsrc.py, line 170, in buildsources   File tmpeasyinstallQMa4cepandas0.14.1tempeasyinstallf6lreInumpy1.9.0numpydistutilscommandbuildsrc.py, line 329, in buildextensionsources   File tmpeasyinstallQMa4cepandas0.14.1tempeasyinstallf6lreInumpy1.9.0numpydistutilscommandbuildsrc.py, line 386, in generatesources   File numpycoresetup.py, line 432, in generateconfigh    File numpycoresetup.py, line 42, in checktypes     entrypoints   File numpycoresetup.py, line 293, in checktypes  SystemError Cannot compile Python.h. Perhaps you need to install pythondevpythondevel. codepre  pThe message at the end is definitively wrong. If I do a codepip install numpycode before running codepython setup.py developcode everything works fine.

But as far as I could figure out, it makes no difference whether codenumpycode is added explicitly or not.p
Negative 125 pI have two codelistboxcodees in a small perltk script. When I click on one, the other loses focus and the clicked one gains it. I put that in quotes because unfortunately these events do not trigger codeltFocusIngtcode or  codeltFocusOutgtcode. Using the keyboard, ie, the codetabcode key, does trigger these. I have also tried codeltEntergtcodecodeltLeavegtcode and codeltB1EntergtcodecodeltB1Leavegtcode as well as codeltltListboxSelectgtgtcode but none of these achieve what I need. I listed the available events to be triggered, but most are keyboard related. p  pWhat I need is to disable a codeButtoncode when the second codeListBoxcode loses that focus ie, when the first codeListBoxcode is clicked on, and enable it when it gains it via the mouse. So how do I do thisp

Negative 125 pIm currently building a PRISM 5 application in VB.NET by using the MVVM pattern, using the PRISM ViewModelLocator. The PRISM ViewmodelLocator requires all Views to implement the Microsoft.Practises.Prism.Mvvm.IView Interface. This interface contains only one property DataContext. p  pAs a View which is a FrameworkElement already has a property DataContext, in c it is sufficient to add  IView behind the View class name without providing a new implementation for the DataContext property implicit interface implementation. By magic, the ViewModel is then automatically wired to the View through the Datacontext property. p  pIn VB.NET this is not possible, as you cannot do implicit interface implementations. When adding Implements IView at the top of the class, VB instructs to provide an implementation for the DataContext property. As the FrameworkElement already has a Datacontext property, VB automatically adds an implementation for a Datacontext1 property. Of course, wiring up ViewModel to View doesnt work. Below is my codep  pstrongViewstrongp  precodeImports Microsoft.Practices.Prism.Mvvm  Namespace Views     Class MyWindow         Inherits Window         Implements IView          Public Property DataContext1 As Object Implements IView.DataContext     End Class End Namespace codepre  pstrongViewModelstrongp  precodeImports Microsoft.Practices.Prism.Mvvm  Namespace ViewModels     Public Class MyWindowViewModel         Inherits BindableBase          Private mTheText As String  This is the text.

Negative 125 pI have a select input with a controller that when a value is selected wants to pass that value to a directive that will display it. In this case, draw a shape on a leaflet map.p  pThe issue is I want the value to be fire and forget so they select the shape, the select box resets to empty again immediately, and the directive in charge of drawing receive the shape and draw it.p  pMy initial thought is to have a service that links the two so when the shape is selected, the select controller updates the service and sets the codedrawThisShapecode variable, which is referenced on the directives scope and being codewatchcodeed when it changes, the directive draws the shape.

Negative 125 pIs there a way to record or describe a Java refactoring in a way that it can be automatically applied to a depending code basep  pMy company works with two separate Java code bases, a platform and an addon depending on the platform. In fact, multiple addons for different customers. The platform and the addon are developed by different teams working on different release cycles The addon is updated some time after the platform is released. A refactoring applied to the platform is not automatically applied to the addon, because the platform team does not even look at the addon code. The addon team uses the previously released platform code in readonly mode, and currently has to reapply the platform refactorings manually e.g. renaming classes and methods.p  pI wonder if and how the addon team could apply the platform refactorings to the addon automatically, instead of having to jump from compile error to compile error after a platform update.p  pCurrently, Eclipse is used as IDE by both teams, but usage is shifting towards IntelliJ Idea.p

Negative 125 pI want my app to show the side navigation drawer as soon as the main activity is created.

I also tried OnStart and I fear my options are over. Any idea Im sure this is pretty simple but I cant figure out.p  pstrongEditstrong I realize I wasnt so clear with my first exposition of the question Biu. Im talking about a purely graphical issue here. The point isp  ul lipI have something to happen at startup in my case were speaking about the nav drawer sliding into the main screen, but it could be any animation I thinkpli lipIn my case, one could just callp  precodeprotected void OnCreateBundle b  ... DrawerLayout.openDrawer  codepreli lipThe above solution works well. The issue Im talking about is graphical with the above code you launch the app and find the main activity covered with an emalreadyopenedem drawer. Instead, Id like the user to have clue of what is happing, to see where the panel came from in other words, to see the opening animation. pli ul  pSo my question is when should I call codeopenDrawercode The main Activity onCreate isnt quite right, because the animation ends before the user gets to see something on screen.p  pI thought that the wish of having something emstartem when all is loaded would be more common.p

Negative 125 pIve been using eclipse for a while and I have noticed something quite annoying. If I am entering arguments for a function and I hit comma while typing a string, eclipse advances to the next argument rather than typing a comma and the only way to enter a comma is to ether copy an existing comma in the editor with the clipboard or to hit commatab until the argument entering system is disengaged. Does anyone know how I could disable this feature comma or the whole argument entering assist There is nothing in the key binding settings.p

This would also be true of the not yet implement, but possibly future requirement of codeWinecode, codeSpiritcode etc etc.p  pSome items fit perfectly in to a generic codeShopItemcode class. They need no extra functionality. codeShopItemattemptToBuycode is a normal use case.p  pHowever  I have to rely on someone remembering to override the codeWineattemptToBuycode and codeSpiritattemptToBuycode.p  pAs you can see  if I want to emreallyem lock it down, Id ideally be able to force an override at the current level of inheritance.br Im sure there are better examples of this, but Ive tried to make it as obvious as possible.p  pIm happy if the answer is no, you cant do that... I just want to know if you can. I have the code working, but just via a direct override that is unforced. But I want it to be forcedp  pThanks in advance. Rickp

Negative 125 pI like Orchard CMS but I dont like it enough to rebuild my entire web app on top of it.p  pInstead I would like to be able to delegate responsibility for view rendering and route handling to Orchard for specific routes, and handle the rest myself.p  pFor instance, when a request comes in, if it has the prefix codeOrchardcode then I would delegate the request to Orchard entirely, using it like a black box unaware of implementation details. Otherwise, I would handle it myself.

Negative 125 pi wrote a script for my 2D car game for an infinite track. So i got a killer behind my car, that destroys all ground objects coming out the screen on the left and on the right i have a spawner that spawns all my blocky sprites in it and it works pretty good. Here is my update functionp  precodevoid Update      ifMathf.Roundthis.transform.position.x  limit              Debug.LogLimit reached         limit  10         Spawn       codepre  pI attached the script to my camera and i have a start limit set to 160 because i already got 15 10x10 sprites as start. Everytime my spawner passes the xaxislimit it spawns a new sprite at this position and sets the next limit 10 higher. This works good if I dont drive too fast. Because then it stops spawning and the world is cut off. When I drive back to get my spawner back into the already spawned area and drive slowly again to it, it works again. I believe the method is just to inefficient to spawn fast enough so I maybe need another style of doing it.p  pFor the understanding here the rest of the scriptp  precodeusing UnityEngine using System.Collections  public class Spawner  MonoBehaviour      public GameObject[] obj     private int limit  160     public int yAxisValue  1     public bool isOnlyDirt     private ArrayList rotationValues  new ArrayList   void Start      Spawn      int value  0     forint i  0 i lt 4 i              rotationValues.Addvalue         Debug.LogrotationValues[i]         value  90        void Spawn      Vector3 pos  new Vector3 Mathf.Roundtransform.position.x, yAxisValue, transform.position.z      Quaternion rotation  new Quaternion 0, 0, 0, 0     ifisOnlyDirt              int zRot  introtationValues[Random.Range0, rotationValues.Count  1]         Debug.LogzRot         rotation  new Quaternion0, 0, zRot, 0           var SpawnedGround  Instantiateobj[Random.Range0, obj.GetLength0], pos, rotation      SpawnedGround as GameObject.gameObject.tag  Gro codepre  pI also have a oneliner to move my spawner in front of my car so it can spawn thingsp  precodepublic float yCoord   void Start       this.transform.position  new Vector3 transform.position.x  160, yCoord, transform.position.z  codepre  pI parented it so i just have to write it in the start function.p  pAny ideas to improve this one Thanks p

Negative 125 pIm having SQLite trouble in a multithreaded application. I have an Activity which uses a subclass of AsyncTaskLoader to perform some data import from a file specified by an Uri as it comes from Android Storage Access Framework, and when the loader is started and does its work it writes to the database and the device is rotated, I get a android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabaseLockedException database is locked code 5 exception. I know what the problem is multiple SQLiteOpenHelpers accessing a database, but I am not sure how Im supposed to fix this. Here is my codep  pActivityp  precodeprivate void importTestsUri uri      Bundle loaderArgs  new Bundle     loaderArgs.putParcelableURIIMPORTERLOADERARG, uri     getLoaderManager.initLoader0, loaderArgs, this.forceLoad   Override public LoaderltExceptiongt onCreateLoaderint id, Bundle args      Uri uri  args.getParcelableURIIMPORTERLOADERARG     return new ImporterLoaderthis, uri, dbHelper   Override public void onLoadFinishedLoaderltExceptiongt loader, Exception exception      getLoaderManager.destroyLoaderloader.getId      if exception  null           import failed, show toast      else           init Ui        Override public void onLoaderResetLoaderltExceptiongt loader       nothing  codepre  pNote I dont create the Loader in onCreate rather, I do it on demand when the import functionality is invoked, and destroy it as soon as it is ready. Im not sure if this is a correct way of using loaders.p  pNow more detailed information about the problemp  ul liwhen the activity is started, it creates a DbHelper which is a SQLiteOpenHelper subclass, stores it in a member field, and reads the database using getReadableDatabase, but most likely it will be writable anyways to initialize the Ui show a list of items etc.li liif an import is triggered, a Loader is created and it gets the DbHelper from the activity this import reads a Uri using its InputStreams, does a bit of parsing and writes rows to the databaseli liwhen, during import, the device is rotated, the following happens the loader is still going on I dont want to destroy it, I want it to finish its task and trigger updating the Ui when its done, possibly in the new, rotated, activity  thats the very reason I use a Loader, and it still uses its instance of DbHelper and its open connection however, the activity is destroyed and then created again, creating another instance of DbHelper, which again tries to read the database to initialize the Uili lias a result, there are 2 DbHelpers with one open connection each, and the second one from the new activity instance throws the SQLiteDatabaseLockedException from getReadableDatabaseli ul  pUntil now, Ive been using a new DbHelper in every activity in the app as it wasnt possible to use the db from multiple threads, but now that I implemented the first background use case, all hell breaks loose, of course. So actually, it seems to be possible to have multiple connections opened at the same time, as long as they are not accessed simultaneously, as I had many activities stack on top of each other, each having its own helper, and wrongly didnt close them in onPause and open in onResume.p  pSo, the question is if Im doing anything fundamentally wrong here Based on my research, there seems to be only 2 solutions create a ContentProvider which will manage the database I would like not to be forced to do this as I really dont need no CP, or somehow keep only one DbHelperconnection for the whole app. How I do it is unimportant, but as of now my favorite would probably be a singleton yuck initialized in a custom Application subclass. In the future I would like to try Dagger so I would probably make it a Singleton, but not yet.p  pstrongEditstrong unfortunately, my ui still blocks  the importer transaction blocks any db reads from the ui initialization methods. I guess I need to figure out a way to start reader transactions which are not blocked by the single write tx.p  pstrongEdit 2strong I was able to successfully unblock readers while a writer is working.

Negative 125 pGiven codencode 32 bit integers assume that they are positive, you want to sort them by first looking at the most significant codeshiftcode in total bits and recursively sorting each bucket that is created by the sorted integers on those bits.p  pSo if codeshiftcode is 2, then you will first look at the two most significant bits in each 32 bit integer and then apply counting sort. Finally, from the groups that you will get, you recurse on each group and start sorting the numbers of each group by looking at the third and the fourth most significant bit. You do this recursively.p  pMy code is followingp  precodevoid radixsortMSDint start, int end,            int shift, int currentDigit, int input[]       ifend lt start1  currentDigitgt32 return            find total amount of buckets      which is basically 2shift          long long int numberOfBuckets  1ULltltshift            initialize a temporary array       that will hold the sorted input array      after finding the values of each bucket.              int tmp[end]           Allocate memory for the buckets.        int buckets  new int[numberOfBuckets  1]             initialize the buckets,         we dont care about whats       happening in position numberOfBuckets1        forint p0pltnumberOfBuckets  1p          buckets[p]  0     update the buckets    for int p  start p lt end p       buckets[input[p] gtgt 32  currentDigit  shift                  amp   numberOfBuckets1  1]     find the accumulative sum    forint p  1 p lt numberOfBuckets  1 p        buckets[p]  buckets[p1]     sort the input array input and store it in array tmp       for int p  start p lt end p      tmp[buckets[input[p] gtgt 32  currentDigit shift              amp numberOfBuckets1]]  input[p]          copy all the elements in array tmp to array input    forint p  start p lt end p           input[p]  tmp[p]     recurse on all the groups that have been created    forint p0pltnumberOfBucketsp        radixsortMSDstartbuckets[p],         startbuckets[p1], shift, currentDigitshift, input           free the memory of the buckets     delete[] buckets     int main             int a[]  1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 8, 4, 3         int n  sizeofasizeofint         radixsortMSD0,n, 2,0,a         return 0     codepre  pI can imagine only two issues in this code.p  pFirst issue is whether or not I actually get the correct bits of the integers in every iteration. I made the assumption that if I am in position codecurrentDigitcode where if codecurrentDigit  0code it means that I am in bit code32code of my integer, then to get the next codeshiftcode bits, I do a right shift by code32  currentDigit  shiftcode places and then I apply the AND operation to get the codeshiftcode least most significant bits, which are exactly the bits that I want.p  pSecond issue is in recursion. I do not think that I recurse on the right groups, but due to the fact that I have no idea whether the first issue is actually resolved correctly, I can not say more things about this at the moment.p  pany feedback on this would be appreciated.p  pthank you in advance.p  pEDIT added main function to show how my radix function is called.p

Negative 125 pI am trying to calculate distance between latitudelongitude points between two separate ESRI shapefiles in R Studio.  One shape file consists of EEZ exclusive economic zones of the United States, while the other one is a shapefile consisting of all cities of the United States.  I was wondering if there is a package or some way of determining the distance between two points on two shapefiles.p  pAnd in an additional step if possible I want track ship distance and determine how many miles of the ships journey was within US EEZs, and how many were outside of them.  I believe that it is possible to determine this by usage of shapefiles, but I am not sure how to go about this process.  And I do not have specific coding just yet, I just wanted to get advice and a general idea first.p

Negative 125 pIm trying to test the integrity of the relationships between entities in my Parse database with Mocha by looping through each value in the database and asserting that the relationship attribute contains the correct data. Parse supplies an a hrefhttpparse.comdocsjsapisymbolsParse.Query.htmleach relnofollowcodeeachcodea function that makes this simple by selecting each item in the specified class and performing a callback on it. The callback function that I am using compares two attributes a list of strings that represent ids and a list of relations, then asserts that each id in the string has a corresponding relation.p  pThe problem is that Im not sure where to place my call to codedonecode so that all my tests can run. If I place it at after end of the code.eachcode with code.each.thenfunction  done code the testing stops prematurely and if I place it anywhere inside the .each loop it will call codedonecode multiple times. I have also thought about splitting the async functions into multiple tests but Im not sure how I would do that because of how new I am to Mocha.p  pLooking at related questions on SO I didnt see any questions that were asking the same thing as mine. If anyone has any suggestions on how I should change my code to achieve this goal it would be very much appreciated. This is my first time using Node.js and Mocha so any input on something Im doing fundamentally wrong with the language is also appreciated. If anything I said was unclear then mention it in the comments and Ill be sure to clarify.

Negative 125 pI read couple of comments by the developers on other threads regarding use of static variablep  ol liIt costs memory Is there a way to release memory occupied by static variables when we exit from the class where they were definedcreatedli liWhats the difference between using static against static final variables in terms of memory management in case you couldnt avoid using it.li ol  pI understand that using static is against OOPS concepts, memory management is poor, defeating the concept of encapsulation. If I use 56 static variables will the impact be so big that I literally have to stop using it. Or may be someone from you guys can suggest me the actual use of static in Java an object oriented programming languagep
Negative 125 pI have this application that consists of a REST backend intended to servicing requests from an HTML5JavaScript client which Im also building.p  pIm planning on implementing an authentication mechanism that uses Basic Authentication where the JavaScript client would store the Base64encoded users credentials for the duration of a session. These credentials would be sent with each REST request in the Authorization Basic header.p  pAll the conversation between the JavaScript client and the REST backend would occur over HTTPS. Im know thats a performance drawback in itself as it adds the overhead of encryptingdecrypting every single requestresponse, and thats ok for now. p  pWhat Im really interested in at this point is the security aspect of it. I know the schema Ive described is nothing novel and a lot of people have used it in their implementations at least thats my understanding. However, Im interested in knowing if anyone has encountered any security breaches or drawbacks with that.p  pThe only thing I can think of would be if malicious code on the client side could somehow gain access to the stored credentials I think thats is highly unlikely but hackers are a creative bunch and some JS engines are buggy, so you never know .

But such a thing might not exist for codeDBSCANcode.p  pSo my strongquestionstrong is What is the proper way to extrapolate the codeDBSCANcode model should I train a supervised learning algorithm using the output that codeDBSCANcode gave on my test dataset or is there something intrinsically belonging to codeDBSCANcode model that can be used to classify new data without rerunning the algorithmp

Negative 125 pIve recently have been debugging some stuff related to promises in angular.js and noticed that angular puts resolutions of promises into its evalAsync loop as depicted in a hrefhttpblog.xebia.comwpcontentuploads201310evanasyncloop.png relnofollowthis diagrama. I was under impression that promise callbacks are always executed in asynchronously as a new event in a event queue. However, with angulars mechanism its possible that if any of the promises is resolved during digest cycle and angular starts another iteration on digest the callback for the promise will be called in the same execution stack since codeevalAsynccode queue is always checked firstp  precodedo   while dirty loop   dirty  false   current  target    while asyncQueue.length      try        asyncTask  asyncQueue.shift       asyncTask.scope.evalasyncTask.expression, asyncTask.locals      catch e        exceptionHandlere          lastDirtyWatch  null       traverseScopesLoop   do   traverse the scopes loop   ...    while current  next ...    while dirty  asyncQueue.length codepre  pIs is not misleadingp

I tried contacting the owner of this piece of code, but no luck. I have never used core graphics, so Im trying to figure out why performance is so bad. Performance starts to degrade at around 23 seconds worth of audio the waveform doesnt even fill the screen.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comijQzA.png altThis is a screen shot from the app, the waveform doesn39t even contain that much data.p  pMy first question is, is this redrawing the entire audio history every time drawRect is called If you look in the drawRect function marked by asterisks, there is a variable called CGRect x. This seems to affect the position at which the waveform is being drawn if you set it to 60 instead of 0, it starts at x60 pixels instead of x0 pixels. p  pFrom my viewController, I pass in the audioData which gets stored in the self.bufferArray property. So when that loop goes through to draw the data, it seems like its starting at zero and working its way up every time drawRect is getting called, which means that for every new piece of audio data added, drawRect gets called, and it redraws the entire waveform plus the new piece of audio data.p  pIf that is the problem, does anyone know how I can optimize this piece of code I tried emptying the bufferArray after the loop so that it contained only new data, but that didnt work.p  pIf this is not the problem, are there any core graphics experts that can figure out what the problem isp  pI should also mention that I commented out a piece of code marked with  at signs because I need the entire waveform. I dont want it to remove pieces of the waveform at the beginning. The iOS Voice Memos app can hold a waveform of audio without performance degradation.p

Negative 125 pI have a project which is built using the yeoman angularfullstack generator. Part of this setup is a grunt build task which creates a codedistcode deployment directory.p  pSo I wanted to deploy just that directory to Heroku and thought this would be an actual use for a git submodule. Rather than worrying about pulling down external changes, a submodule allows be to setup the dist directory as a separate repo that I can deploy independently to Heroku.p  pThis all works nicely on localhost where I can cd into the submodule directory after grunt has completed its build, and then just commit the changes and push them to the submodules repo. Heroku is watching the repo and automatically deploys.p  pMy problem is that when I tried to do the same thing in CircleCI, I dont seem to be able to codecdcode into the submodule directory in order to addcommitpush the built distribution.p  pOne thought is that I run CircleCI off the dist repo, but this will require me to include all the test in the repo which Id prefer not to deploy to heroku.p  pIm looking for anyone thatp  ol liknows how to commitpush just the submodule in CircleCI, orli lihas a better idea of how to deploy the dist directory only to Heroku.li ol
Negative 125 pI am currently studying sorting algorithms and need to implement HeapSort and Introspective Sort.p  pI think I have implemented HeapSort successfully the code works, tried on millions of random arrays with random sizes, always worked, heres my codep  precode  public static ltT extends Comparablelt super Tgtgt void hsortT[] a      int n  a.length     ifn lt 2 return      Heapify      forint i  n22 i gt 0 i       moveDowna, i, n     forint i  n1 i gt 0 i        swapa, 0, i       moveDowna, 0, i         codepre  pAnd the moveDown code isp  precodeprivate static ltT extends Comparable lt super Tgtgt void moveDownT[] a, int i, int max      T e  a[i]     int j   Son index      whilej  2i1 lt max        ifj1 lt max ampamp a[j1].compareToa[j] gt 0 j  Biggest son        ife.compareToa[j] gt 0 break       a[i]  a[j]       i  j          a[i]  e    codepre  pThese 2 methods shuold work completely fine, I have tested them multiple times and I never encountered any problem.p  pI am also trying to start from those 2 methods and implement Introspective Sort, my code is something like thisp  precodepublic static ltT extends Comparablelt super Tgtgt void introSortT[] a      int size  a.length     ifsize lt 2 return     int log  Integer.SIZE  Integer.numberOfLeadingZerossize     introSorta, 0, size1, 2log     private static ltT extends Comparablelt super Tgtgt void introSortT[] a, int min, int max, int lev      ifmax  min lt ISORTTHRESHOLD isorta, min, max  Small intervall     else iflev  0 hsortAuxa, min, max  HeapSort on Array Portion     else         QuickSort       while min lt max          lev          Tukey approximation          int t  tukeyApproximationa, min, max1         t  min Ignore this for now and read below this code         T p  a[t]         int i  min, j  max         do            whilea[i].compareTop lt 0 i           whilea[j].compareTop gt 0 j           ifi lt j              swapa, i, j             i j                     whilei lt j         introSorta, min, j, lev         min  i                codepre  pI think that the code above is fine too assuming that the methods isort and hsortAux work fine. On my testing I noticed that it only fails when the heapsort is called. The code should work the target is to make it work both when I use the tukey approximation to determine the pivot index and when I choose a random pivot like for example always the first element of the array. The partitioning with the QuickSort should be correct because I have tried many quicksort implementation and they all work and, as I already said, the code works when heapsort is not called. The partitioning is actually a copypaste from a quicksort in another method which works perfectly.p  pI know for sure that the methods isort and tukeyApproximation work as intended because I have tested them alone and on quicksort implementations and they work just fine.p  pHowever I dont seem to be capable of implementing a heapsort the method called hsortAux that does its job only on an array portion between min and max. I have spent several hours looking for an answer here and on Google, I have tried to implement my own version by looking at others peoples code but I have failed multiple times and here I am wasting your time . Once I managed to make a working heapSort but it didnt seem to work when the pivot was not chosen by the tukey approximation e.g. the first element of the array or a random one in the portion.p  pHere is my current hsortAux code, derived from the origianl hsortAuxp  precodeprivate static ltT extends Comparablelt super Tgtgt void hsortAuxT[] a, int min, int max      forint i  min  max  12  i gt min i       moveDownAuxa, min, i, max1     forint i  max i gt min i        swapa, min, i       moveDownAuxa, min, min, i         codepre  pmoveDownAux is supposed to be the moveDown method that only works on an array portion however I really have no idea how to implement it, I have tried to use the previous moveDown method instead but it obviously doesnt work at all. When implementing moveDownAux Im not even sure I need the variable called emminem.p  pHere is my current moveDownAux methodp  precodeprivate static ltT extends Comparablelt super Tgtgt void moveDownAuxT[] a, int min, int i, int max      T e  a[i]     int j   Son      whilej  2i1 lt max1        ifj1 lt max ampamp a[j1].compareToa[j] gt 0 j  Biggest Son        ife.compareToa[j] gt 0 break       a[i]  a[j]       i  j          a[i]  e    codepre  pThanks in advance for your time and answersp

Negative 125 pFrom a hrefhttpsdocs.oracle.comjavase8docsapijavautilstreamStream.html relnofollowthe docsap  blockquote   pStreams have a BaseStream.close method and implement AutoCloseable,   but nearly all stream instances do not actually need to be closed   after use. Generally, only streams whose source is an IO channel such   as those returned by Files.linesPath, Charset will require closing.   Most streams are backed by collections, arrays, or generating   functions, which require no special resource management.

Negative 125 pThis is not really a question as I have already resolved my problem.  I am just passing along what I found and what I did about it.p  pMySQL allows parameter SQLMODE to be set to multiple values in the my.cnf file.  However, Amazon RDS allows only one value, whether you use their browserbased console or their CLI tools.p  pI have found a perhaps not perfect solution to the problem of not being able to set SQLMODE to multiple values. In my procedure below, I show what my settings are. You may choose whatever values you think are pertinent to your environment.p  p1 In your parm group, set SQLMODE  TRADITIONAL or which ever one value is your highest priorityp  p2 In your parm group, set initconnect to SET SESSION sqlmode  TRADITIONAL,IGNORESPACE,NOENGINESUBSTITUTION,ONLYFULLGROUPBYp  pNow when a client logs into the database, their session SQLMODE should be set to all values passed in by the initconnect string. In my case, this equates to IGNORESPACE, ONLYFULLGROUPBY, STRICTTRANSTABLES, STRICTALLTABLES, NOZEROINDATE, NOZERODATE, ERRORFORDIVISIONBYZERO, TRADITIONAL, NOAUTOCREATEUSER, NOENGINESUBSTITUTIONp  pCaveat Editing the initconnect value after setting it involved cutnpaste.  However, I found that trying to delete an initconnect value after setting it is a big hassle, so be careful in working with it. The hassle To delete an initconnect value after setting it required that I create a new parm group from scratch, set all values except initconnect to what the original parm group had, delete the original parm group, then rename the new group with the old name.  This was true with both Firefox and Chrome.  I also could not delete the value using the CLI tool aws rds modifydbparametergroup.p  pAlthough not really part of this post, if anyone responds with how to deleteresetnullout initconnect without the kind of hassle I describe above, that would be great.p  pUPDATEp  pNever mind.  I have discovered that an initconnect setting on RDS will NOT survive a database reboot. Therefore, the solution I offered above does not work.p  pAlso, since one cannot remove delete an initconnect setting through the console why not, one can remove it by using the strongaws rds resetdbparametergroupstrong CLI command rather than rebuilding the whole parameter group like I described before.p  pI am VERY disappointed that Amazon RDSp  ul liDoes not allow multiple SQLMODE values.li liDoes not allow us to delete an initconnect setting through the console.li ul

Negative 125 pI have a smallish solution, with about under twenty projects. The solution used to also contain about six source projects written by a third party service provider, ACME. Now, finally, this other party is supplying us strongonlystrong with a handful of DLLs. I used to just included their source, one project per DLL, in the solution, and so I am looking for a neat way to include all these assemblies in the solution, so they can be referenced from the many projects that need them.p  pMy immediately apparent options arep  ol liCreate an codeAcmeAssemblycode project, add all DLLs as project items set to copy to output.li liCreate an codeAcmeAssemblycode solution folder. Quicker and simpler than a binaryonly source project, but solution folders have the very, very large drawback of having no means of grouping the files without a solution file, i.e. outside of VS.li liCreate a NuGet package that includes all the required binaries. Then at least we also have a partly phycical grouping in the codepackagescode folders. My problem here is I have never written a NuGet package, but I am not asking how to here. I am asking about three candidate solutions, and more will be welcome, and if NuGet wins, I get to learn to write a package.li ol  pI cant simply use the projects output codebindebugcode and codebinreleasecode folders. To me, these are strictly output folders, and nothing but other dependency assemblies should also be output there. Deleting the codebincode folder should have absolutely zero effect on a build, so that is certainly no place to store binaries.p

Negative 125 pNowadays, Im participating in few competitions in codegolf. For a particular question. Ive submitted an answer in java which contains Nested loops like this.p  precodeforint i0 i lt 200000000 i     forint j0 j lt 1000000 j         declare some variables         do operations         modify variables outside of for loop       codepre  pAssume this takes codencode time.p  pAnother member posted a similar answer but like this.p  precodeforint i0 i lt 200000000 i     nextLooppass necessary args   private void nextLoopnecessary args     forint j0 j lt 1000000 j         declare some variables         do operations         modify variables outside of for loop       codepre  pBut this takes only 60 of codencode time. then I realised it would be related to Garbase collection of the nested loops. The logic of both codes were the same, but seperating the inner loop into a method makes it more faster. I assume this is because Garbage collection is happening once the codenextLoopcode method finishes but there is a problem in Garbage collection regarding First codes nested for loops.p  pNow regarding first code, does the memory taken by inner for loop wont be automatically garbage collected once the next iteration of parent loop startsp  h2REAL CODEh2  pstrongMethod 2 Fasterstrongp  precodepublic class MinPrimeFactorSum       static int[] primes  new int[20000000]     static int count  0      static int temp     static int p     static long total  2      public static void mainString[] args           long start  System.nanoTime          int i3         for ilt10000000 i  2               Calling the inner loop as a method             temp  getDatai             if i  temp                   primes[count]  temp                 count                          total  temp  2                  System.out.println i     total   in   System.nanoTime  start1000000   milliseconds             Inner Loop as a method     private static int getDataint i          temp  i         forint index  0index lt count index               p  primes[index]             if i  p  0                   temp  p                 break                          if p gt Math.sqrti                   break                               return temp        codepre  pstrongMethod 1 Slowerstrongp  precodepublic class MinPrimeFactorSum       static int[] primes  new int[20000000]     static int count  0      static int temp     static int p     static long total  2      public static void mainString[] args           long start  System.nanoTime          int i3         for ilt10000000 i  2              temp  i               Inner Loop Starts             forint index  0index lt count index                   p  primes[index]                 if i  p  0                       temp  p                     break                                  if p gt Math.sqrti                       break                                            Inner Loop ends              if i  temp                   primes[count]  temp                 count                          total  temp  2                  System.out.println i     total   in   System.nanoTime  start1000000   milliseconds         codepre  pIve posted this question only after a series of tests.p

Negative 125 pIve been trying to look more into this but I cant seem to find a good explanation of why this is happening. p  pSo I am making a REST API call to a Sharepoint list. All I want is to grab information from the Sharepoint list through VBA. As far as I can tell, its extracting data from the correct view. However, if I make a small manual change to the Sharepoint list through a web browser on an item and then if I go back to run the code REST call  snippet below to see whether or not the update was picked up, I find that nothing has changed. p  pSo my question is, if an application is making a REST call to a Sharepoint list using a GET request, what is the amount of time for Sharepoint servers to update new requests. I thought it would have been everytime a GET request would have been called that the newly updated item would show but this is not the case for me.  p  pJust brainstorming other ideas, but, could it possible that within VBA, once a request has been run, is that query result stored in temp memory If so, would I need to flush it out every time a new command is run p  pHeres a snippet of my code I want to stay anonymous as possible, so Im showing dummy servers. p  precode    Set req  CreateObjectMSXML2.XMLHTTP     params  owssvr.dllCmdDisplayampIDampXMLDATAtrueampList7BltLISTIDgt7DampView7BltVIEWIDgt7D     URL  httpsltSHAREPOINTSITEgt amp params     req.Open GET, URL, False     req.Send codepre  pAny input is appreciated, thanks. p

Negative 125 pIm working on my second big canvas project a game and are really trying to optimize everything. p  pI have my mouse and keyboard listeners set up so they change the state of my canvas layers but all drawing is done through my rAF call. This works well. p  pHowever, Id like to do a similar thing with the rest of my game. Could I add an event listener or somehow update all my statesvariables after each rAF call completes drawingp  pFor example, if something must move five pixels left I currently do the subtraction then draw. I would like to be able to do the subtraction after each frame outside the rAF and then inside of it just draw, draw, draw. No calculations. p  pThanksp

Negative 125 pIm working on an ANSI C application that produces file contents in reverse order.  That is, the bytes at the end of the file are received first, and those at the beginning are received last.  Preferably, due to the amounts of data that may be involved, I would like to write this data directly to the file without first arranging it in a separate memory buffer.  Is that possible  How may this be accomplished using ANSI C  If this can only be done with a higher level library that is not ANSI compliant, that would acceptable.p

Negative 125 pI had this huge form built in Knockout and we decided to move on to angular because of how well it scales. p  pI cannot wrap my head around the angular concept of the form that needs to be created in angular from knockout. In the KO form the structure looked like this.p  pEach Self.xxx was a bootstrap tab that was sectioned out into their own VM. I could then do a KO.tojson and send the whole heirarchy of VMs in json form to the server. On each tab I did databindwith BasicInfo and the scope of that VM was in that tab. p  precode var NewTitleForm  function     var self  this   self.BasicInfo  new BasicInfo   self.Contributors  new Contributors   self.Formats  new Formats   self.Demographics  new Demographics   self.Marketing  new Marketing  codepre  pTab VM samplep  precodevar BasicInfo  function data     var self  this    self.Title  ko.observabledata.Title  .extendrequired true    self.Subtitle  ko.observabledata.Subtitle      self.Publisher  ko.observablepublisher  h.f.ullmann.extendrequired true    self.Imprint  ko.observabledata.Imprint  .extendrequired true     self.Series  ko.observabledata.Series      self.SeriesName  ko.observabledata.SeriesName      self.NumberinSeries  ko.observabledata.NumberinSeries    codepre  pWhat I was trying to do was something like codescope.BasicInfo  new BasicInfocode. But it just doesnt wire up correctly. Im not sure if I am approaching this correctly either. There is about 100 fields that go on this form. So sectioned VMs among tabs is hopefully what I am going for. Any help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 125 pI have been using the JMS Serializer library to handle conversion of json responses to and from entities while working with an API. With the annotations I have marked one of the properties of an object as a DateTime type TypeDateTime so that it convert the json string to the appropriate DateTime object. However it is also possible for this property to be empty which would result in an empty json string. As a workaround I have now just replaced the type DateTime for a simple string, meaning I have to manually convert it to datetime in later phases of the application so this is not ideal. How would you normally handle these kind of situations an object type which can be empty in JMS Serializer p
